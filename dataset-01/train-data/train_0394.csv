3,I expected a little better product,"They are cheap made and get out of adjustment essily. The vibration causing them to move. They are made to rotate on the over head guard when they are hit by brush, limbs, etc but they are lose and turn with out being touch. I will be looking to replace soon."
5,Tis the best of the begining....,"I am not a person to read books, ever. I started reading, and could not tear myself away, from the excitment of Tarl's first taste on Gor, or his becoming is the caste of Warriors, to the Greastest, battles, in Ar, and over himself, I lost myself in the writings... Tis the greastest begining of all beginings!"
5,This is A terrific book!,"I enjoyed this Book very much. It was soo good that it had me reading it for 5 hours strait at one time. John Norman really know how to right Sci-Fi books.To that guy that said that the way the Gor series has been adopted by BDSM and how it's degenerating, I don't think that he know what he is talking about because I role play in those place. All it is having fun using your imagination. Everything we do is based on the Books. Some things have had to change obviosly becuase it's on the Internet. But for the most part it's the same except there are real people saying the stuff.Anyways, I recommend this book to anyone...even if you don't like Sci-Fi...it has Romance, suspence and something for everyone."
3,"Awkward, but good.","I said ""good"", not great. I really enjoyed the beginning and the end but the middle was a little burdensome. I don't mind all of Tarl Cabot's ""luck"" at all (as some have taken issue with). It is the will of the Priest Kings. :-)I'm working my way back through the series. I read it all as a teenager back in the early 80's but only made it to about Assassins. I can't even remember why I quit but I suppose I'll find out soon enough.Norman's writing style is difficult at best. But the storyline wins out. I read this 40th anniversary edition of Tarnsman in single day. It was well worth my time and I found the last few chapters went by entirely too quickly. Looking forward to Amazon sending out the next 5 to me."
3,Nice first book in a long series,"The beginning had me intrigued, after all I myself am a kajira of Gor and serve in a tavern , so this was my way of learning ceratain facts for myself....quiet slow in places..and sometimes a little complicated..would like to have seen more kajira..but on the whole a nice begginning."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Fantasy bondage fantasy. With Robert E. Howard style fade to black no sex, so basically completely pointless. Unless you were looking for something racy in 1928 perhaps. Tarl Cabot is a man from earth, and ends up on another world.Here, men are manly men, women are tools to be used, and quite often they enjoy it."
2,Not For Me,I am not able to objectively review this book as it is not at all the type of book I read. Others may like it very well.
4,Definitely reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom books,"Unknown to the people of Earth, there is a planet that orbits the Sun exactly opposite the Earth - The Counter-Earth, Gor. And when a professor at a small New Hampshire college is spirited away to Gor, he finds himself in a world of warriors and slaves ruled over by the mysterious Priest-Kings, rumored to be both omniscient and omnipotent. But, Tarl is a man of extraordinary abilities, and he intends to not just survive on Gor, but to triumph!This is a very good book, definitely reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom books. The action is very good, and the setting is quite interesting, making for a very enjoyable, if rather old-feeling book. (It was written in 1966, after all!) I enjoyed Barsoom, and I enjoyed Tarnsman of Gor, and I don't hesitate to recommend both."
3,Run of the mill,"I know there's a whole sub-culture revolving around these books and that they are very popular among many circles so I thought I'd give them a try. I just wasn't impressed. I've felt like I've read this story a thousand times written by other authors with more vivid language. The drastic change in the main character from when he is first introduced to you to when he makes the transition to Gor is just not plausible. The book was still engaging to a degree. I wanted to finish it and find out what happened but it wasn't a ""page-turner"" by any means. Sure the slave culture may be hot, and I believe that's the appeal of these books, but there wasn't enough to keep me coming back for me."
4,A Fun Read,Good read even 40 years after I first read it. Heroic heroes with like able foes and dastardly villains abound in a story of chivalry.
2,horrible,"I bought the first book, and pushed myself to read through it, but I couldn't immerse myself into the story at all because of the atrocious use of language and adolescent writing style. It read like a 5th grade boy's writing assignment that got him in detention and a phone call to his parents. Sorry, but I was really expecting more seeing as how there is such a cult following."
1,Soft Porn For the Masses,"I'm sorry, but I read the Gor novels years ago, and found every one of them completely disgusting. Not only were action sequences utterly forgettable, but the soft porn submissive female crap was really quite offensive. A women is getting off by being tied up, and as long as her face is covered, she is okay with rape? What la-la land is Norman living in? The land where most women wouldn't give him the time of day? It's hard to believe this clown is actually married. Some men get off on rape; most women (big surprise) don't. Norman has a certain flair with language, but his ability to articulate anything close to a female experience clearly comes from his prepubescent wet dreams. To dignify his unrelenting torrent of garbage as ""philosophy"" just proves that there are a lot of guys out there having wet dreams because they haven't got a shot at the real thing."
5,Still in print after 38 years,"Norman's books continue to draw interest because they are unique. I concede that most people seem to HATE them beyond reason. However, I'm drawn to them for the very fact that they are so absolutely politically incorrect. I find Norman's writing style and views refreshing because so many Historical and SF books are written from the safe perspective of 20th century sensitivities. My main purpose in writing this is to say that after first reading his books 30 years ago I haven't found another author who creates the same sort of reading experience as Norman (Lange?). Also, it's true that in the later books you can skip whole chapters and not miss anything."
3,A good read for info on Gor,"Although Johns writing style is never perfect, nor especially eloquent, the story did get me involved and I became lost in the world of Gor.As this was the first book, in the series of 26, I am hopeful the characters will evolve and the explanation of Counter Earth, introduced in this book, will expand. Disappointingly there was little explanation of the Priest Kings, but I expect this is covered in detail further down the track in other books.Overall for anyone wanting to discover Gor and be involved in any of the Sims or societies this is a good starting point. If you are after a clever Sci-Fi with depth and insight then look elsewhere as Tarsman of Gor is merely a good space cowboy romp. However for some light fantasy with sexual undertones and some chivalrous heroics, then this book is a perfect under covers late night read."
3,Entertaining with Flaws,"It was a well-written work for the most part but there are some flaws that may cause a reader to scratch his or her head and wonder what the author was intending. Some of the characters, the females in particular, are painted in such a way as to be almost demeaning. While it must be understood that this is a fantasy work in a fantasy world the reader will be hard pressed to keep 'real humans' and 'Gor Humans' apart in his/her mind and this could cause some problems with the text, especially if the reader is female. While it is a unique method of storytelling to create a male dominated society (although some books in the series do have female-dominated cities) the method by which it is carried out leaves some to be desired. Overall, however, the work is clearly entertaining and is worth reading if the reader is able to clearly remember that it is fantasy."
5,Thrilling from the Start,"GOR is currently a 31 (soon to be 32) book series. This book does not contain anything unsuitable for teens, but it deals with adult concepts. The story follows the Hero Tarl Cabot on his journey to become a soldier for his city of Ko-ro-ba. He learns hand to hand combat as well as flying the might hawk like creature known as a Tarn. You explore what a world might be like with all manners of technological advancements without being allowed to advance militarily. This book is definitely a Cult Classic."
3,Passable,"Very good... as escapist fiction goes. However, I don't understand the obsessiveness with which the fans of the series behave. An interesting read, but should come with the caveat ""Don't try this at home,"" considering the author's obvious biases on certain issues."
2,DVD condition,"The 2nd disc in the set kept freezing up.I don't think that a description should include ""very good or like new"" unless there are no imperfections whatsoever."
5,"Review of ""The Wire""","Simply one of the best shows on television: tense, realistic, with excellent character delineation, keen insight into bureaucracies, startling but truthful relationships and the best writing around."
5,Must See Viewing,"The Wire is in my opinion one of the best series in television history. The writing and acting is the best of any modern television series. You've drawn in from the first episode and hang on to every action and word spoken. For anyone that appreciates not only a crime drama, but well-defined characters and mesmerizing story-telling, this is the series for you. You will not be sorry. The second season of The Wire does not focus on the main characters from Season 1, but you're introduced to crimes beyond drugs and a whole new set of very interesting characters. From season to season, the characters and storylines interweave and it all begins to come together. The Wire is not for the faint at heart or for folks with short-attention spans. Sit back and enjoy the ride."
5,Great Show!,I had heard about this show when it first came out but I never had the time to look at it. Boy what a mistake! The writers and actors are first class! I suggest it to everyone I meet.
3,Slow Start,"After the riveting first season of THE WIRE, Season Two's opening episode was a slow start. There was some catching up to do, some plot development, some foreshadowing, but eventually, it all came together. The good news is, once all the ground was laid in Episode 1, Episode 2 was off and running. The same adrenaline rush kicked in and Season Two turned out to be just riveting as the first. Enjoy!"
3,Wire Season 2,The Wire second starts right up from where the first season ends taking a more in depth view of its main characters and looking into the suppliers of Baltimore drug game. This is my least favorite season because it is the bridge season that leads to even greater stories to come in the third season. It is worth the watch for any fan of the show because so many seeming unimportant things that occur in this season play major roles in the seasons to come. It is overall a good season but in comparison to the others it feels like a filler.
4,Good movie!,"Show is great, but product was received defective. Good thing is that it was replaced with little to no hassle."
4,The Saga Continues,"The second season takes a turn... While not an expected continuation, the second season of The Wire delivers with all the drama, action and ""street cred"" of the first, this time focusing on life on the docks. The season continues and wraps deeper into the first season to push the overall direction of the series further. Don't let the first few episodes deter you, the season will bring you back for more."
2,It could have been better,I liked it but none of the dvds will show the first epesode and some of them wouldn't show the second epesode but other than me being a big fan of the whole series I didn't like it
4,Very Pleased,I originally thought i was getting the hbo box sets but it was used hollywood video copies.either way for the price i'm satisfied and season 2 was great just heading into season 3
1,Disgusting unrecognizable pork and hominy,"I wish there was a review out there I could've read that would've steered me away from buying this before I wasted $3. I don't expect much out of canned food, but at least a spicy Millennium old Mexican soup could have more than a monotone, bland flavor and the texture of beans and franks, with unrecognizable hunks of pork and what was once hominy corn. Just figure out how to make it and cook it yourself, unless you're just a Pozole addict and far from home."
1,Audio not playing properly,"This blu-ray was played on a Panasonic BD-60 and only Stereo audio played fine. DTS(MA) & Dolby Digital did not play at all. No sound and my AV amp was trying to ""lock in"" the audio. My player was updated with the latest firmware. This is the only BD in my collection that's not up to par. Hopefully it's just a firmware issue and not the BD itself."
3,"All show, no go","This is a very nice looking case. From how well it looks, you would suspect it costs much more. However, the beauty is only skin deep. I would not trust the handle to carry the weight of six wine bottles. One of the decorative pins inside one of the handle's rivet heads started to pull out the first time I used the handle to pick it up. On the inside of the case, two rails along the sides were semi-detached. I had to glue them. The latch that holds the lid shut did not latch completely. I had to bend it to work correctly. And even then the curved design of the latch makes it slide toward the open position when you pick up the case. It's not a very stout latch either. I simply don't trust this latch to hold.So if you want a case that's cheap and sits there looking pretty, you certainly can't beat this for the money. If you want something to actually carry wine around, carry it from the bottom."
3,Not for Khet 2.0,"THis is a great idea for a great game that my 14 year old likes. Unfortunately it was not clear form the description that this would not work with the Khet 2.0 game we purchased. It does not fit in the holes. The bad thing was that it came up as ""suggested"" after we purchased the Khet 2.0 from Amazon. Since it would cost more to send it back, we just kept it and are working on a way to alter the bottom so it fits."
4,Fun stuff - makes chess boring.,"Great fun with my son. Getting to know the laser angles and implications of your next moves is a challenge for sure. A minor complaint is that when the laser needs to traverse a long distance (and bounce off many mirrors), the laser starts to fully miss the pieces (and you have to play with how they are seated in their squares to get a clear ""hit""). I would glady pay much more for a better aligned all metal version; however, bang for the buck, this is a great game in that it gets to qualify as a toy also! Note, we also purchased the beamsplitters which makes things more fun and more complicated."
3,"Warning! This will NOT fit the spaces on ""Khet 2.0""","I don't usually review much. But I thought I could possibly help someone else find the right item by reviewing this one. These pieces were made for the original game. The new ""Khet 2.0"" game (which I have) is made with the game spaces smaller. So any game piece made for the original Khet game will not fit into the game spaces on a ""Khet 2.0"" game board. Everything else about these pieces is exactly what I expected and it is not the fault of the seller that the new Khet 2.0 board was made to different specifications. Like I said, I only hope that this will help someone else like me to steer clear of this if they have the new game board."
4,A good addition to the game,"The mirrors are a little loose, but they add a lot of fun to the game. Being able to trick people with the double beam is really helpful.(Transcribed from my 11 yo son's comments.)"
5,Awesome addition to khet,This piece is great for khet. It works wonderfully and really changes gameplay. I love khet in general. I'm a chess player and this game has improved my strategy. This is great and it fits in the original khet box.
4,Great bib for messy eaters,"The most disgusting eaters I know both claim it's an age-related problem that will affect us all in time. Not sure I agree with that theory: Phil and Dalton are only in their fifties despite their hairy nostrils, wrinkly skin and pot-bellies.However, the fact remains that they drool and dribble at lunch like a pair of senile old men, which upsets those unfortunate enough to share their table.Since I bought the shirt bibs their eating habits have not improved but at least their work clothes (that they proudly claim to wash each year, whether they need it or not) appear less stained.I have deducted one star only because there is no below-bib guttering to catch the foul liquids that stream down their unshaven faces and soak their heavily-soiled trousers."
5,I love it!,I just started collecting Susan Lordi and this was a great addition to my collection. I love it! :) :) :)
4,new book,"I was very disappointed after receiving the book it was used, I ordered and paid for new one. It was birthday gift. The seller name is Big Molly."
5,Johnny,Excellent movie about issues of life and death. Should make the spoiled children of today take a second thought about their lives and what is really important.
2,Not for grieving parents,"It's good to see quality Christian films. There is nothing objectionable as far as language or profanity; one fight scene with no direct observable violence ... however, it is apparently not written by anyone who has lost a child. The antagonist mother, who had lost a child in a car accident she caused, was begrudged for not wanting the protagonist, an end stage leukemia child, as a foster child, or to have him wear her dead child's clothes, ride his bike, etc. Having personally lost a young child in an accident, and also being a physician like one of the main characters, I can say some of those who actually have a child in Heaven may be offended at the trite nature in which the grieving mother character is portrayed."
5,Johnny,"Loved it. It was a very inspiring movie, but sad. I watched it again with my grandkids and they were also moved by this movie."
1,Review on DVD Johnny,"Enjoyed the ""Johnny"" DVD. It was a real tear jerker but gave a lot to think and ponder about. It was wholesome and clean and I believe most ages from jr-high on wold enjoy this video. Certainly made us think how fortunate we are in life and made us more aware of what others have to go through just to survive and face the difficulties of life. Johhny had such a beautiful and positive attitude towards death an dealth head on with the difficulties in his life. His faith was beautiful!"
5,Surprised,"The individual the watch was purchased for was very surprised and impressed as well, especially since it was gift. He enjoyed the gift and the craftmanship."
2,TAG Professional Golf Watch,I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband who is an avid golfer. He wore it only on the weekends. The band broke within 6 months of purchase. (They advertise it as being indestructible). I sent it back to the Authorized TAG repair in NewYork and they wanted $200 to repair it because they said Amazon is not an authorized dealer. I would of never purchased the watch from Amazon had I known that. I beleive the watch was defective. Amazon would not repair the watch either.
4,"Good watch, the strap is kind of odd...","The watch itself is a great watch, good quality and looks nice. The only issue with the watch is that the strap doesn't keep snug against the wrist (which is the purpose of the watch). After a few days wear it becomes loose and you have to adjust it to keep it snug. But overall, it's a nice watch."
2,Disappointed,"Expected, when labelled Volume 4, that it would carry on from the end of dvd series 3. Not the case. Disappointed.The story was magnificent and can hardly wait for the dvd series to continue. This vhs offering is not it."
1,noise drives me nuts!,The noise drives me nuts! Too bad the box went to the trash a few weeks ago or the unit would be returned asap. Not clear if the noise is a far or electrical; unacceptable regardless.Additional info direct from the APC tech support -- the noise is a fan and the fan is on 100% of the time due to a change in design. The fan is very loud! The fan is a design change the noise is a known issue that will not be addressed. Completely unacceptable level of noise for such an expensive device.
4,Hate the beep,"Fine item for the price. All my APC stuff has performed well, but I hate the beeping they make when the power is off, and there seems to be no way of turning it off short of opening the case and removing the speaker."
5,Frequent Power Outages Are No Longer A Problem,"The APC BR900 is a superb solution for critical computers that are in an area that experiences frequent power outages, such as ours. The BR900 is totally unobtrusive; you forget that its under the desk, like a good soldier it performs around the clock with no complaints. If and when it comes time to replace the batteries, the access plate is easy to operate, anyone will be able to do it with ease. Having the Power Chute software and extra data connecting cable that comes with it; makes an unattended automatic shut down a breeze, well before the batteries are down. Two business friends of mine now have one, based upon my recommendation and they are both pleased with its price and performance."
4,Great Unit but short lived battery,"This unit worked great for about 18 months and then wham, the battery just went TU. I realize that the mfg. states that the battery should be replaced at least every 3 years but honestly, has anybody ever seen an APC ups battery go bad? I was really surprised when the ""replace battery"" light started flashing and the constant audio alarm starting becoming a pain. I soon found that the cost of this replacement battery is over $77.00!! Not only that but nobody seems to carry this thing. All of the usual ""Office"" supply guys or even the local office stuff people carry these batteries in stock. Everywhere I went, I was told to order it online and even APC didn't show it in stock. What a pain. Living in daily Thunderstorm country this was a big problem for the week or so that it took to get the replacement battey from a third party. Just be warned that this UPS has worked perfectly and protected my machine on many occasion but, the battery may be a short lived component."
1,disappointing and boring,"A recent positive review of Mr. Watson's latest non fiction book, brought me to this fiction book. I was hoping to combine the fun of a mystery with the interesting facts of the art trade. I found none. The story is extremely boring, badly written, and there is more supspense in opening a jar of jam than in this entire book. The characters are predictable, the action slow. Was this book published without an editor ?"
1,BORING,"Good God - I hated this book. I pride myself on always completing a novel, regardless of my level of enjoyment, but at three quarters of the way through I had to put this book down. It was so boring and dull. If you have insomnia then this book is for you because you'll choose sleep over continuing to read. Whereas Dan Brown's, DaVinci Code is fast paced, glossy and easy to follow along, this book is rough hewn, painfully unexciting and almost impossible to follow. The clues between the connections in the artwork and the mystery trail are so obtuse that they are not worth one's time in trying to unravel. Overall a very unsatisfying read!"
4,Vegas Sunrise,"Good quality book for the price, and it arrived as promised. I have not yet read the series, but hope to do so soon. Fern Michaels is always an exceptional author, and I am sure this series will prove to be some of her best."
5,Best of the Bunch,"This is by far the best, most ""up to date"" book on the market. Most of the other ""big"" titles available were published Jan of 1999 right before Apache made big changes in its configuration, making those books seem dated. The content is fresh, easy to understand and comprehensive. A definite must read for anyone interested in using Apache Server."
4,Pretty good,"This book has been generally helpful. It is well written, appears to be accurate, covers many topics, and is well indexed. It does not have the level of detail that, say, a good O'Reilly book has, but I believe it happens to be as good as (or maybe a touch better than) the O'Reilly book on this subject."
3,don't miss a must read,This is a great book and the story is well written. I can't wait to get the next vol.
5,Profound yet readable,"I'd never have thought that a book dealing with cosmology and chaos theory could be a real page turner, but this one is. It blends science and spirituality so seamlessly and presents such a positive possibility for the future. I loved this book. I'm starting to read it a second time."
2,Quality?,"Sure, it LOOKS like the original, and IS a cheap replacement. The mirror wiggles incessantly. So much that I want to smash it with a bat just to calm my irritation of the constantly moving mirror image. It looks just like the original, but sure doesn't feel like it. It's much flimsier plastic. It DOES fold back just fine. For the price its a barely acceptable replacement for the original."
1,More Fiction than Fact. :-(,"After reading Michael Asher's ""The Real Bravo Two Zero"", it was disappointing to realise that the true story had been given a ""Hollywood Action"" makeover.Its a good read but not really what happened on the mission."
1,Disappointing!,"As a Desert Storm vet, I eagerly anticipated reading this book for a different perspective than my own. My unit was on the other side of the line than the SAS (behind enemy lines), and I expected to read about scud hunting, special ops mayhem, and outwitting the Iraqi military. Instead, the few pages of patrolling and fire-fights don't make up for the excrutiatingly slow story after the guys are caught. I would have enjoyed reading about McNab's non-Desert Storm exploits rather than all of the filler information."
5,Very good!,"This book made me hold my breath - feel helpless at times and I just wanted to help! As an American there were lots of phrases that I didn't know the meaning to. But with the help of a Kiwi friend and a Brit friend, I learned alot too. Turns out most of the phrases were swearing!"
4,Great book with vivid accounts of wartime imprisonment,"This is a great book which gives insight into the type of people us and our allies are facing in the war on terrorism. Mr. McNab describes in detail, sometimes through humor, the ordeals he and his men suffered when captured by Iraquis in the Gulf War. Other than the minor differences in British English and American English, his writing style is entertaining and easy to follow and understand. This book should be required reading for all those who think that our war on terrorism and treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay is too harsh."
1,This Story Is Not True !,"Former SAS trooper Michael Asher ( who speaks Arabic ) retraced the Gulf War mission described in this book and found that plausible eyewitness accounts differed greatly from the events written in this book . He also tried to carry the heavy baggage the same distance as described in the book and found it impossible , but his most suprising revelation was that no enemy was killed in mortal combat at the hands of this SAS team , which makes the author's ludicrous figure of 250 enemy dead laughable . It's also come to light that there are glaring discrepancies between the information given by the author at his SAS debriefing ceremony , and the events that take place in this book .If this book had been published as a work of fiction I would have given it more stars as it is a rolicking story that Hollywood would have been proud of , but to publish it as fact is irresponsible to say the least , given that certain reputations have been damaged by this book ."
5,Bravo two Zero - not for the weak-stomached,"A good book. Here's hoping that the movie isn't as vivid as my imagination. The worst thing about it is that someone had to suffer through many horrible things for it to be written. If you enjoy this, try Andy McNab's fiction - 'Remote Control' is great and I can't wait to read more."
4,aaare mate this is a pritty boss book,"THIS BOOK ON THE WHOLE IS BOSS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES ITS A BIT BORING. ANDY MCNAB IS TOTALLY ROCK,I WOULD OF GIVEN IT 5 STARS BUT I KEPT ON GETTING MIXED UP WITH WHO WAS ALIVE AND WHO WAS DEAD ,WHICH ANNOYED ME A LITTLE , BUT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS PURE."
3,Ineresting - but not quite what I expected...,"So they go in, destroy some scuds, kill some Iraqi's, and mostly escape, right? Wrong. They go in, get spotted, run away, get shot or caught, and spend the rest of the war getting abused by their jailors. So it wasn't quite the story I was expecting. Disappointed. Nevertheless, worthwhile reading. Interesting to read about their methods, and admittedly, they ARE mega-tough professionals."
5,Great Read,"The story is about the attempted escape of a team of special forces soldiers from iraq during the first Gulf war, and is an excellent read. Highly recommended."
5,The book the Beatles never were,"Well, kiss my face if this isn`t the best book i`ve ever read. I`ve read many good books and as as good as they were they just weren`t Bravo Two Zero by Andy Mcnab. However my copy has a bit of damage to the cover - I was made promises about storage that weren`t kept. Well I`d better keep this review short, I`ve got a photoshoot for Vision Express at two`o`clock and a corporate for Allied Dunbar at four. Oh, by the way, what do people reading this think of the Pedestrianisation of Norwich city centre? Because I`ll be honest - personally I`m dead against it... Alan."
1,A story about the SAS in the gulf war...Too bad its fake.,"Yes your heard me. I havn't read this book, but I *have* read ""Eye of the Storm"" by Peter Ratcliffe. Peter says that in this book, alot of the stuff is made up. For example, according to McNab if the dogs approached the patrol, he and his men would use their ""fighting knives"" to kill the creature.As Ratcliffe writes, he says that no man in his right mind would attack the dogs anywhere in the middle east because they are probably rabid, and the chances of anyone killing a dog with a knife is very slight indeed.That and the fact the only knives the SAS carry on them are ""clasp knives"" which is apparantly the same as a swiss army knife.You can read it, but don't take it seriously."
2,Take a pass on this book,"This book is interesting, but not for the firefights, for the insight into what it takes to survive behind enemy lines.To me ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Band of Brothers"" were a hundred times better.As it turns out, much of the book is plain bull----. For books telling stories of soldiers behind enemy lines, some of the SEALs and LRRPs book are much better.These are my opinions as a former infantry grunt"
3,average,"This book is somewhat entertaining, but not entertaining enough for a work of fiction. It briefly covers the author's life, the SAS and how he got into it, and the poor planning his unit undertook before going into Iraq. There is brief action, and he spends the rest of his time as a POW.Not only is this account disputed in another book 'the one that got away'(chris ryan) but much of it is shown to be fiction in another book 'the real bravo two zero'(michael asher).I would recommend reading it in concert with the other two books."
5,Will Change Your Life!,"This book is awesome, and will change your life. Don't believe the morons/idiots/cowards/non-hackers that insult Andy McNab for the fact that the operation went wrong and is therefore his fault. That is the very nature of military special operations, and the book is at its best as it catalogs how this SAS team copes with said difficulties against amazing odds and in very difficult conditions.I could not put it down once I started reading it and everyone person I have recommended it to had a similar story. His following book, detailing his entry into the SAS is another great one. Anyone considering entry into the military, with dreams of entering an elite force, should read this to understand the uncompromising mindset that is required."
4,Heavy Stuff,"This book was given to me as a birthday present and it was certainly a very sobering read. A mission behind enemy lines goes pear shaped from the get go and our highly specialised SAS team is straight into a fight for their lives.The bulk of the book is around the capture and subsequent torture over a long period and you have to wonder just how much the human body can endure. Andy witnesses and experiences incredible brutality at the hands of his captors and loses close friends.If you want to read something that is a small snapshot of a greater scenario, still true to life but not bogged down in any politics of the situation, then give this a go. But I hope you have a strong stomach."
5,The most heart touching story I have ever read.,This book is one of the most heart wrenching stories I have ever read. I respect anyone who can withstand what Mr. McNab and his friends put up with. I salute him and his crew. You guys are what I wish I was.
5,Great Movie - 2 Great Actors,"This movie is well worth your time.. I would probably give it 4/5 stars but since the overall review for this is only like 3.3, I gave it a 5 for the boost. I really enjoyed it. Great acting, well-filmed, and interesting plot development."
4,Hannibal returns,"Anthony Hopkins' character of Ted Crawford in this film is reminiscent of his Hannibal Lecter character in previous films where he plays a devious individual who believes that he can get away with the murder of his unfaithful wife. Ryan Gosling does a good job portraying his opposite in this film, state attorney Willy Beachum who accepts the assignment believing that it is a slam dunk with a confession that later gets thrown out in court. Crawford could have accepted his good fortune and departed, but he continues to taunt Beachum and this leads to the ending of the film, which I will not reveal here. The movie moves along well and was entertaining."
3,A 'B' movie,"Anthony Hopkins performed his stuff as usual and without him this movie wouldn't have been released. It was a good story that could have been told a lot better. For instance, we are led to believe that the character played by AH was highly intelligent;an engineering scientist of some kind. But this was never developed to any degree. The Director need not have dwelt on it for long but just long enough to satisfy the audiences curiosity. Apart from AH and a couple of others the cast was ill selected. The principal part of the prosecuting lawyer was totally unconvincing. And are actors not taught how to enunciate their lines these days. In this movie the 'Method' acting style is used in which the actors speak like they would in an office. One has to keep upping the volume to understand what they're saying. Very irritating. So I give Direction a low score on this account and for the overall presentation. A pity, a dramatic balloon that was far from fully inflated."
4,"Hopkins, Gosling, and... Hoblit succeed together","As far as the plot is concerned, other reviewers have covered that. I want to compliment Greg Hoblit, the director, for his final version. I reviewed the deleted scenes and the alternative endings. This director showed his above average skills by choosing NOT to use the ""let's-spell-this-out-for-the-viewer"" scenes. Those who disliked his style may have preferred the alternative endings. Those who need neither the cliche endings nor the lesser TV-copshow aspects will appreciate Hoblit's choice of scene options and endings."
4,Pretty Good,"I do not discuss plots with movies. Better to not ruin things and let people watch without knowing what is going to happen.Maybe it is because I love Hopkins, but I thought this was a pretty good movie, well worth watching and certainly worth owning."
5,"Strong movie, engaging and well-written thriller, one of the year's best","A taut and well constructed thriller with great scenes of one-ups-manship between gosling and hopkins. The competing sub-plots of one man's rise vs. another's fall maintains the dramatic tension. The romantic aside also hits the right points as it doesn't attempt to dominate the main tension of legal and office political manuevers. Good supporting performances, well edited and driven, and one of the year's most solid films."
2,Like Paint Drying,"Sir Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. Ryan Gosling is gorgeous and believable. I love both of these actors, but...""Fracture"" didn't work, but went on and on and on...like paint drying, like something that could have been said and done and over with in 1/2 an hour.After a while, one just doesn't care. After 1 Hour, I was ready to scream, ""So what!"" And after that... well the characters, content, dialouge, everything---was like something you just wanted to END.The problem was...these actors were much bigger than the movie, but in closing, they couldn't even make it worthwhile or less painful."
1,glue on surface,it had glue or some adhesive on itit jammed in my playeri had to take to a shop to get it extracted $$$ more than i paid for the product from GOHASTINGS...FRACTURE WITH ANTHONY HOPKINSWILL BE LEERY OF THAT DEALER WHEN BUYING A USED DVD DISC IN FUTURE...
1,Are you serious???,"I saw this movie whilst it was in theaters with high expectations. It has been a LONG time since I have fallen asleep at a movie in a theater, but this one managed to do it. I had to use the restroom (and I hardly ever use the restroom at the theater) and I missed the one exciting part the film had to offer, and even that part went unexplained.Anthony Hopkins, shame on you."
3,"good, but not great * mini spoiler alert*",this is an almost movie... The relationship between the protagonist and his boss is so unbelievable that it as silly. The sexual tension interest was off. But a young hot Ryan Gosling and as always intriguing menacing Anthony Hopkins were great. The extreme behaviors dont make sense and that is what brings this down from a 4 to a 3.
5,Very entertaining,"This was a top notch legal thriller -- stylish with decent dialogue, taut plot with some interesting twists, a well developed villain and protagonist, and excellent acting all around. The weakest part of the film for me was the obligatory love interest, but that was a very minor distraction. Five stars may be a tad excessive, but for its genre it was one of most engrossing I've seen. I did guess the ending a short while before it was revealed, but not so soon that it spoiled the suspense."
5,FRACTURE -- A Must See,"This movie is a great psychological thriller. You can't beat Anthony Hopkins performance and Ryan Gosling does a terrific job as an ambitious attorney. What I liked best about this movie is it's unpredictablity and twists around every corner. I won't give away the ending, but it made the movie totally worth the time watching it -- a WELL DONE film! If you like psychological thrillers, Anthony Hopkins, crime dramas with hints or sarcasm, wit, and surprises, you'll love Fracture."
1,Best Nap of my LIFE,Okay how to start this review....I watched this because I like Anthony Hopkins. He to me is a good on edge actor. Any who.... I started watching this and fell asleep within 20 minutes of the movie. This movie is god awful boring. I am so happy I did NOT pay $8 to see this theaters and went to see Blades of Glory. (Which I also fell asleep during) lol. I really think from what I have see of Fracture. Watched once Fell asleep during the start. Than I picked it up in the middle. I think this movie just sucked.
3,It's Entertaining; Not Great,"Though there are plot twists that could be argued, the movie is still effective. Gosling is very convincing in his role. Hopkins, one cannot help remember Hannibal during this role, is just okay with a strangely changing accent over the course of the movie. The female role makes absolutely no sense. The movie ended minutes ago and I cannot remember her character's name. It is not a gripping movie; more of a psychological game (but certainly not on par with Sleuth)."
3,Not bad; Hopkins good as always,"3.5 starsAnother decent Grogory Hoblit film, but with nowhere near the impact of Fallen.Hopkins is usually a good indicator of quality, and he makes this film work.Gosling is solid, does what he's meant to.A good police thriller with some ok surprises, this is good but not great.Hopkins really adds something to every role he plays. Fracture is worth seeing mainly for his typically fine performance."
4,Silence of the Lambs Redux,"This thriller, with the indefatigable Anthony Hopkins and relative newcomer Ryan Gosling, inevitably reminded me of Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins plays a cold blooded killer, who blatantly shoots his wife and seemingly gets away with it. Gosling is a rough-cut rising star in the District Attorney's office, who through talent and connivance has managed to grab the gold ring--an associate position at the top law firm in town. All he has to do is quit. But he just can't let Hopkins get away with murder.Hopkins is suitably menacing, Gosling just committed enough to win our sympathy. You know Hopkins can't be allowed to get away with it (there'd be no movie otherwise) but figuring out how he almost does keeps the suspense up."
4,good movie great actors,pros: Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling make this movie great.cons: The plot is somewhat predictable but still nicely put together
5,Fracture DVD,"This is a movie that I had seen before and like it. I saw that Amazon had a huge DVD blowout sale and that prompted me to love for the movie titles that we were looking to add to our collection. If you haven't seen this movie, it has some interesting twists. Can't beat Anthony Hopkins for performance, and Ryan Gosling is easy on the eyes."
5,Fracture,Really a well-done 'he-dunnit - but will they prove it' mystery. Hopkins was amazing. It made my flight from Dallas to SF painless!
4,"Entertaining, but gaping holes in logic","The film is entertaining, and it invites the mystery fan to figure out some disconnects, even via a flashback. Example: How did Ted know how to purchase the identical gun owned by the arresting cop? How can Ted be prosecuted at the end for murder, when to pull the plug, you need a court order? Doesn't he share guilt with the attending doctor and the judge? There are a few more, and you have to see the movie to see my points.But there is a big BUT! The vast majority of new movies make less sense, and are not as well made. So the flaws I point out in continuity and logic, are really minor, when viewed in the big picture. Watch it and you will enjoy it."
4,I hate it when I know the story from the first five minutes.,"This movie was pretty good, except as a mystery it gives too many clues from the onset. The whole time I felt like talking to the screen. Although the acting was much better than average and the cinematic directing very engrossing, the story was too weak to match, and failed to engage any empathy with any of the characters.Overall a pretty good but far from great movie."
5,Excellent!,"This mind twister will keep you on edge. Hopkins shoots his wife, and even confesses. What seems like an open and shut case for a cocky attorney turns into a nightmare as he realizes the murderer he's trying to put away is more clever than anyone ever imagined. The biggest question: How did the murder weapon disappear when the house was surrounded? Unless someone tells you, you'll never guess in a million years! (all me and my husband's guesses were wrong). Very well-written and well-played by all the actors.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Mind-boggling murder fun,"Thought it started out kind of slow, but it gets interesting fast. I don't want to give away the plot developments, but you can see from the start that Hopkins is manipulating Gosling, and it bodes ill for the young prosecutor, who is used to winning his cases and gets torn between his desire to nail Hopkins and his high-paying dream job. There are some great twists and some difficult choices to be made by Gosling's character.I guessed how ""it"" was done halfway through, and my sis guessed how they would overcome a formidable legal hurdle, but it was still an enjoyable ride. Not a fast ride, but a simmering one."
4,"If you look close enough, you'll find everyone has a weak spot :-)","This is a very smart movie. I really enjoyed it (although some parts moved too slow). Anthony Hopkins is as on top as ever and he really delivered a great performance. Ryan Gosling also did a fantastic job and was very believable as a district attorney out to prove Hopkins guilty of shooting his wife.I found this gripping and engrossing and there were enough surprises in it to keep me guessing. While there was one or two predictable parts, the ending was great and I like the fact that we were left to do a little bit of wondering. I don't know that it's the kind of movie to go out and buy to watch over and over, but as a first time viewing and maybe once more after you've pieced it all together, I really recommend you at least see this once. Very entertaining."
3,"nothing original, but good on its own merits","The plot is nothing you haven't seen before: a clever attorney tries to go up against a brilliant criminal who can more than match him in a contest of wits and legal twists. However, Hopkins, Gosling, Strathairn and others make this watchable."
5,Fracture,"I think Ryan Gossling has got such a talent, that any movie he is in is great, and to act with Anthony Hopkins, it is a must see movie. Your not wasting you time watching it, Especially if you are a Ryan Gossling fan, or Anthony Hopkins.It is a different kind of movie, and Anthony Hopkins always plays creepy very well."
4,I loved Fracture!,"It was surprising and the acting was good. Ryan Gosling was much younger in this film, but you can tell that he is going to have a very successful movie career. And Anthony Hopkins is good in everything...lol"
4,Not 2 Bad,"I would say this was a really good movie. I would recommend to watch. i don't know about buy though. It was kind of predictable if you actually look at all the clues , think about what's going on, and know something about law. Than it probably wont be as interesting in the end, but it was still a good movie."
3,Watchable,"Despite the obvious gimmick, seen a mile away by all, but the young and inexperienced, a reasonable way to waste a couple of hours."
3,Moderately Gripping Courtroom Drama ....,"At times it evoked for me ""The Firm"" by Grisham. Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job but he could read the Cleveland phone book and make it sound compelling. A decent two-hours of escapism!"
2,"subtitles, please","The script for this film was average, the photography was intrusive, and the lighting was at times absurd. The biggest drawback, however, was actor Ryan Gosling. He's either eating, rubbing his nose, or twitching and turning as he mumbles his lines. His leading lady was only slightly more articulate. Subtitles would have been helpful. Perhaps this shoddy acting could be called ""post Brando.""Still, this movie has Anthony Hopkins and is (barely) worth watching. That it lacks a solid ending might contribute to the negative reviews so many have expressed."
3,"Delightful Anthony, Disappointing Plot","I couldn't wait to watch this movie, as I have been an Anthony Hopkins fan for some time. He was great! I enjoyed watching him toy with the over-confident and arrogant young prosecutor. I did like the way he set the crime up so that there would be no proof that he was the killer.Without Anthony, though, this movie would be a flop. I want it in my collection of movies simply because I thought Anthony's acting was superb - certainly not because it's an excellent movie. It's an all-right movie starring a superb actor."
5,Fracture,"""Fracture"" is a movie I grade an A+! The music!...the lighting!...the suspense!..It ranks right up there with Silence of the Lambs!"
3,Decent thriller,"It's hard to see Hopkins play a sinister role without calling to mind the iconic charcacter of Hannibal Lecter. I guess he will always be identified with that role, which, I guess is a shame. His villainous portrayal in this film seems to be nothing more than a slightly watered down version of Lecter.The plot is interesting and moves along at a moderate pace, but the ending is a bit easy to predict once you pass a certain point.Despite a few flaws, ""Fracture"" is worth a one-time viewing. The picture and sound quality are both very good and the extra features are decent enough to satisfy, but if you want to see Hopkins at his best, I suggest the original ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Bounty""."
4,using breast pump for growth,once I figured out how to use it - awesome - made me feel just like having them sucked on - quite a turn-on!!
4,Does it come in black?,"I purchased this in 2013, long after its release date. Inside the DVD box were Batman themed promotional items that did not seem to come from Warner Brothers. The movie and bonus disk are authentic. I wasn't sure about the promotional items. It doesn't really matter, since the expiration dates are have long passed. I am happy."
3,Like Some Kitsch?,"Okay, I saw this movie when I was 9 for the first time, so it's nostalgic for me. It was the first time seeing Spider-man live action! Now, new viewers will find the special effects horrible, Spider-Man's costume laughable, and his opponents unworthy. But it's worth seeing if you can avoid comparing to last year's blockbuster. Nicholas Hammond is earnest, if a bit old, as Peter Parker. There are some amusing moments between him and David ""Larry Tate"" White as Jonah Jameson, and the groovy 70's soundtrack will have you snapping your fingers. Thayer David of ""Dark Shadows"" chews the scenery to entertaining effect--if he's not a super-villain, he is at least convincing and menacing as Byron, a mind-control specialist who (inexplicably) employs three bamboo-wielding Kung-Fu henchmen to guard his pad when he's not around! You'll be shaking your head and chuckling after it's all over, but glad you sat through it."
1,Tiny!,"If you take big pills (ie... Fish oil) this is not for you. I have taken prenatal pills, on several occasions (I have three children, lost three others) I have no idea how you could fit anything else in this if those are what you are taking! The two end compartments are bigger, but still not enough to hold my pills... 2 fish oil, two multi vit, 1 B complex and then the room is full and that is only the two end sections that are bigger. I still have 10 pills more to go! It will work for keeping some of my kids vitamins and perhaps a few pills to throw in my bag for work in case a shift goes long and I won't be home (that happens a lot with me) but for everyday... nah. At least I didn't blow a lot of $$$ on it."
1,Dsappointing,"Lost my Apothecary 7-sided pill organizers on vacation. Bought this turtle thing as a replacement. Very disappointed. Difficult to open & close. Can't open all the little compartments at once to see the whole week at a glance like I can with other 7 compartment pill boxes. Also this one will not stand on end in the medicine cabinet like the Apothecary 7 sided pill box. The turtle can't compare to the 7 sided Apothecary pill organizers for quality, convenience & ease of use."
2,A little on the cheap side,"I like this pill planner mainly for it's shape. It's small enough that I can just stick it in my purse. Unfortunately, it's kind of cheaply made. When you lift one of the tabs, it will only open up a little bit for you. You can't force it open any further because the tab will just break off, which is what happened to me. The plastic ""hinge"" of the tab is just a stiff piece of plastic. It is not very pliable. So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get, or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off. I would have otherwise been happy with the product."
3,To Small but Cute,Honestly when I purchased this I didn't pay close attention to the size and thought it was cute and would work since it had the right number of slots. It was way to small to hold all the vitamins I take each day and half the slots the Omega 3 barley fits in.
2,poor quality,"I bought this for the compact shape, and my pills do fit, but not all of the compartments close snugly. One of the larger end compartments (Th), won't latch shut. Some of the other latches seem a bit questionable, too. Just doesn't seem well made."
2,Strong Start,"This book started out really strong. The characters were likable and I enjoyed the fact we had both points of view throughout the book. However, the characters weren't very well-developed as the plot continued and it slowly just fizzled out. Also, Dylan's relationship with his dad was resolved WAY too easily.These other Love Stories books are much better: I Do, At First Sight, Max and Jane, Jake and Christy."
4,i really liked this book!,"I thought this book was really good. It all started when Laurel Bayer moved to California from Grange Ohio. Right before she left she told one of her best friends, Gavin that she liked him romantically and he didn't feel the same. On the first day of school she meets Dylan Fraser, a total player though she doesn't know that. So she sends an email to Gavin and Liza (her other best friend) that she's having an all out blowout for her sweet sixteen but really she has nothing planned and that she met a great surfer guy! But she really didn't. And for Dylan, he's really into art but his dad wants him to take debate and he is a player but he likes Laurel and asks her out. His friends Cara and Dave, almost warn Laurel about him but them figure out that he's really serious! Then all the fun starts when Gavin and Liza are coming for Laurel's fake sixteen bash, it's up to Dylan to figure out something to do!"
5,Read this BOoK!,"I like this book so much becoz' i think it's so cool to read it. Laurels'character was alive and so do Dylan. They are curious abt themselves though they know that they liked each other. This always happens to real life! so to those who have the same problem, do read this book coz' it's worth it!"
4,Sweet,Big ups to CLG for encouraging me to buy this album several years ago - enjoy your marriage dude!
2,Would be better WITHOUT chad micheal murray,"Chad m m makes me nauseous. His nose is stuck onto his face, like a bird poo that splatted onto a dry pavement. His face is expressionless, as is his voice, his arms, and his legs. He is such a bad actor. Hilary is a good actress in this film, as is her step sisters, one of which was Gracie in the Nanny in the series. The step mother is so funny, especially when she ate the cookie and said 'so moist' hehehehehehe. I think that the movie was good, but chad really brought it down. I give the movie 2 stars, because chad's nose took up the other three. Two words: COSMETIC SURGERY!"
2,Feh.,"This movie was okay. I was able to sit through it, but just barely. It was very predictiable--but at least it was supposed to be because it was a copy of Cinderella. Looking at Chad Michael Murray was the best part. ;D"
2,Boring,I believe the story would have been better if it were more on the line of the original Cinderella story. Great for 8-11 year old girls.
1,I donot expect great things from this movie!,"Honestly,everytime that i hear a movie with Hillary duff on it, something in me likes to explode or shout ""Kaluod""!Seriously,i had the impression of this movie as something that will not be great or even successful because first of all hillary duff doesnt know how to do the right impressions when doing a sceen in a movie like the ones she made in the lizzie mcguire the movie.she tends to overact it or maybe she is an overeacting person.Well this is what i can say in seing her act in her past movies.she isnt much of an actor or even a singer.she just like to please people and for one reason, she and chad are not the right pair,she should be paired with daniel radcliffe or someting.well honestly its because i love chad murray!thats all! and dili ko ganahan ni hillary kay o.a. kaayo sha kung kinsay nakasabot ani bright sha!"
1,BAD...i mean really BAD,hillary duff couldn't act her way put of a nut shell. it's bad enough that she's the worlds worst singer (because she can't sing for crap) but then i have to come home to see my little cousins watching her tastless movies! that BAD...i mean really BAD. stop acting stupid! you obviously can't. your not doning me any favors by doing it. you suck hard!!!!
5,THE BEST FILM IN THE CINEMA,"I think that this film really stands out, it is a film the whole family should see, it is a enjoyable, exciting and romantic film. Hillary duff is a really good actres, she shines out in this fairy tale fantasy and i really enjoyed watching her bring this film to life, i could watch it loads of times, i can't weight to get it on dvd some day, it is the best one i have seen her in yet, and i can't weight to see what else she is in, i thought i was going to cry, when her nasty step sisters told austins ex girlfriend, that sam(duff) was cinderella and at the pep rally the show they put on, it was so sad, but at the end, it was a happy ever after!!!!!!!"
3,Gaze into the mind of a 13-year-old girl,"It is what it is. Hilary Duff stars in this modern-day retelling of the Cinderella story as a poor little high school student with Princeton dreams, an evil stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge) and two ugly stepsisters (Madeline Zima and Andrea Avery), and a Prince Charming (Chad Michael Murray) with whom she exchanges text messages unaware of his shocking true identity. There's a contrived happy ending and plenty of clumsy romanticism but the cast is engaging enough to prevent you from wanting to hang yourself. I don't usually see this kind of thing, so it was kind of interesting from a sociological standpoint, especially since I'm an elementary school teacher. Make no effort to seek this out, but if you happen to find yourself sitting in front of it, you might not hate it as much as you expect."
3,Cute,"Cinderella is a cute movie. It's far from anything good, since it's appealing towards the tweens. Collidge is the best, and really saves the movie."
5,Very Good,"My kids liked this movie. Overall, very good and worth renting or purchase. If you like Hilary Duff then get this/"
4,Good!,"Hilary Duff (Lizzie Mcguire, Cadet Kelly) stars as Sam in this funny, family-friendly movie. It's well-acted and has a good message behind it-""Don't let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game."" It's funny in places and shows just how dreams can come true. If you like Hilary Duff's other movies you will like this one! However, her newest movie, The Perfect Man is very disappointing and not I'm going to skip it. In conclusion, a movie definitely worth renting!"
5,great teenage love story,"I bought the movie because I lost my first too & I simply couldnt live without it. The movie is a modern cinderella love story where the overlooked girl gets the popular guy & they fit together perfectly. This movie is great for all ages it doesnt have any bad seens,words, or anything parents neeed to watch out for for their child. I recomeend thid movie to any yound or older girl who loves a good movie with a a great story."
3,Alright,"Not the product in the picture, but a 'double feature' of this movie and the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. It came about a week before it was supposed too, so I guess that makes up for it..."
3,True to its title...,A bit too predictable; Definitely a modern day Cinderella story but lacking in real emotion; Would not pay to see this again;
5,a cinderella story ( full screen edition),me and my sister just watched this movie recently and we thought that the movie was very good.we thought the movie was very well put together and how well the movie came out. we also liked hilary duff's performence in the movie we thought she was good in the movie. we recommend people to buy this movie it is also worth the wait. sincerly chrisfan.
1,Hilary Duff needs to be STOPPED!!!,"Once again this movie only proves that Hilary Duff can't touch Lindsay Lohan with a 10 foot pole. Hilary Duff has got to be one of the worst actors in history, but she still manages to stay on our faces. I know she's suppose to be like a teen pop icon, and she's admired by thousands of 13-year-olds, but she makes my ears bleed. I hate her music even more than I hate her acting. Quite frankly, the only thing that stopped me from scratching my eyes out was the very HOTT! Chad Micheal Murray. I am a ""One Tree Hill"" finatic so, I had to see him. However, the rest of the movie only showed me how much I can't stand Hilary Duff."
1,NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!,Did you not read the title of my review? GAWD! Hilary Duff is a whiny and self-centered teenager who always gets what she wants!NO! Go see another movie. 'Sleepover' looked better than this!!!!!
5,One of may favorite modern versions of the classic tale,All the actors shine in this movie. The step momwas really good she brought lots of humor to this film. Hilarykeeps getting better and better. I also strongly reccomend RaiseYou Voice despite bad reviews from Critics.If I were you I'dtake reviews from this website instead. This film made me laughand cry.
5,VERY CUTE MOVIE.,This is a great movie. The concept is very cute and well done. A modern twist to the Cinderella story we all so love.
4,Cinderella Story,An entertaining story for Hillary Duff fans...or not. Purchased as a gift for twin 10 year old girls who enjoyed the movie.
4,A Cinderella story,The movie `A Cinderella story' is directed by Mark Rosam.This story is about a girl name Sam (Hilary Duff) she scrubs the floors in the restaurant own by her stepmother. She always wishes to have a prince charming one day.Sam go online web site to find her prince charming and she meet a boy. Sam panics when the boy(Chad Michael Murray ) turns out to be the coolest guy in her school. They fall in love with each other when they chat online. Will they be together at last?This movie is transfer from modern. I think that it is very creative for the director to shoot this film.Running time : 95 minutesRating : Parent Guidance (PG)
1,A Cinderella Story,"Hillary Duff and Chad Michael Murray star in this so-called modern version of Cinderella. Regina King steals the show. However, it's just another not-so-great teen movie. Especially Jennifer Coolidge as Sam's crazy step mother.This DVD is not really worth it unless you're a die-hard Hillary Duff fan."
2,Watching a blade of grass is more interesting,"This movie started out okay in that it had its own versions of all the things that happened in the fairy tale it was loosely based on; but then it began to be ruined by such factors as poorly acted crying and masks that don't nearly hide true identities. The movie doesn't select a good point to end at, and really it's not much outstanding amongst other love movies. There at least existed a reasonable plot in this movie, but the plot is probably the only thing I can commend about this film; most characters seemed poorly chosen except for perhaps a unique and likable kid named Carter that is a character in the movie. So, with all these things drawn together, I would give two stars to A Cinderella Story; and recommend it only to those who feel like wasting a few bucks on watching it."
5,great,hilary duff is a great actress i have all her movies i really think u should see this movie jacob
1,Stupid.,"Has Hollywood ran of Ideas? I mean how many dumb teeny bopy, bimbo, happy ending movies that all have the same story line can they make. I Mean Lizzie Mguire is just Substance that Hollywood makes money from. Movies just do not have very many good actors anymore.This movie certainly proves that you don't need talent to be a celebrity.Remember Croosroads.....This movie will certainly not go down in History. Killer Tomatoes makes this movie look Bad.I know a lot of you wiil hate me for this review but Hey! it's a free country. But PLease do yourself a favor Save your $7.00 or$8.00 and see a more worthy movie because this movie is JUNK..............JUNK I SAY!........."
3,"Sweet, squeaky clean 'Cinderella' remake.","This is a decent movie. Hilary Duff looks born to play the poor, put-upon stepdaughter. She is always nice and never stand up for herself. I didn't like Jennifer Coolidge in this film. She has been in a lot of movies lately and I don't think she has been very good in any of them. I did enjoy Regina King's supporting character of Sam's coworker at the diner. She really did a lot with a one-dimensional character. The stepsisters are just flat out annoying. They make you want to fast-forward every scene they are in. Overall, the movie is predictable but is sweet and a very good movie for tween girls."
3,"It's not bad, really...","I'm almost afraid to admit that I liked this movie. I saw it last week while on vacation and found myself enjoying much more than I am comfortable with. Let it be said that I find Jennifer Coolidge utterly hysterical, and here as the tyrannical step-mother she is no different. The story here, of course, is inspired by Cinderella. Hilary Duff plays Sam, a social outcast who slaves away at the diner her evil step-mother took over after her father's death. She is in love with a mystery boy who has been sending her e-mails but she hasn't the guts to tell him who she really is. When it turns out that her `Prince Charming' is none other than high school star quarterback Austin (Murray) it seems that all is against her, but of course Sam does get her man and get the respect she is pining for. No it's far from original and it's far from great but it was cute and funny and a nice way to relax the afternoon away. Plus, Jennifer Coolidge is just always funny..."
4,Great!,"Okay, I'm not going to give you the whole premise of the movie, like most reviewers have been doing, but, this movie is VERY good.It's plot is much more fun than the original Cinderella, although it cannot surpass the original.Instead of a glass slipper, it's a cute little cell phone, and instead of the untouchable handsome prince, you've got a hottie-TAKEN-football player. Evil stepmother? Check. Evil stepsisters? Check.The end scene in this movie, I think, isn't as quite as satisfying as the original, but it's still original. (Getting married and living happily ever after and going to Princeton unsure of what's going to happen next don't exactly pale in bravado comparison.)If you like stereotypical teen romance, cute guys, and as always, a satisfying ending, then this movie is totally for you."
4,Dreams to come true. By Amber,Dreams do come true. The movie A Cinderella Story proves this. Sam is a young girl who gets bossed around by her step-mom and step-sisters. Not only does she get bossed around at home but also at school. Sam's step-mom and step-sister also pick on her and make her job hard. Sam goes from unpopular to going out with the most popular boy in school. The boy is the best football player in her school. One day Sam and the boy both dreamed to go to Princeton together. Their dream came true. They both ended up going to their dream school together. When Sam was gone there was nobody left to do her job EXCEPT for her step-mom and step-sisters to do. This movie is good for kids of all ages. Be sure to grab someone special and watch this movie with your family.
2,Gah! Somebody gag me with a glass slipper!,"What does 'Lizzie McGuire','A Cindrella Story','Raise Your Voice' and 'Agent Cody Banks' have in common?They all feature Hilary Duff acting as...well..HILARY DUFF.This girl CAN'T act to save her life. She portrays her characters the same freakin' way in every movie and it's driving me NUTS.Anyhoo,I rate this movie 2 stars because of Chad Michael Murray (eye candy!) and Jennifer Coolidge (she's hilarious!).Watch it if you've got nothing better to do."
2,Is Hollywood out of ideas!?,"Not another Cinderella story...PLEASE!!! Hilary Duff was good as Lizzie, but she hasn't really matured into an actress yet. Her acting is so-so and the plot of the story is barely satisfying. This is a rental, not worth seeing in theaters."
4,Pleasently Surprised,I rented this movie for my little girls to watch and I watched it with them a few times. I think the new twist and update to modern time story was great...very cute. The music in the movie was great as well! I'm definetely buying this movie for our collection.
1,Dr..... WHY????,"I came upon this book by random chance, and was mislead to believe that this was a piece of true literature. A book (short story really) that stumbles towards nothing. If you're looking for some popcorn reading, sure this might suite you just fine, but avoid like that plague otherwise. I suggest picking up some Vonnegut or Yates. I hope this review might save at least one of you!!!PS: avoid frustratingly pointless epilogue.."
4,Bellissimo is a Revlon Commercial song!,"It's a pretty cool Album in general. I like the sexy European twist to it as well.If you want to hear the sample songs you can go to Amazon.fr & listen to few songs in this Album especially the ""Bellissimo"" which deserves the five star rating!Reza Badei"
1,Terrible,"This book attempts to address two needs and fails at both. First, as an introduction to basic computer science, the author's ambiguous style of writing seems to confuse most students. A poor sense of English grammar permeates the book. Secondly, as an introduction to Java, the book glosses over important details such as how to handle Strings properly. Don't bother... it is not worth your time."
2,Fake sword ok price,The set I received had only 1 sword and not 2 as promised. The sword itself was kind of cheap looking when you look at it up close. For a sword that is supposed to be Japanese it is Chinese. That would not be too bad if it did not have CHINA engraved in the sword. That makes it look cheap.
3,Never made Right,"Pachi Paradice delivered my set of Kill Bill swords in amazing time. They are beautiful pieces. However,the sword with a paper tag identifying it as the Bride's sword does not have the etching on the blade that distinguishes it from Bill's as seen in the pics not only on Amazon,but Pachi's site as well.When I brought this to their attention,Pachi was quick to get back to me ,but said they didn't understand the problem,hadn't heard of this in the past and didn't have any sets ""with two marked swords"".I repeatedly tried to explain to them that I did not receive a Bride's sword,rather two Bill's with one tagged as the Bride's,but they repeatedly did not understand. They did offer a full refund if i returned my set,but i feel they should send me a replacement. All I ask for is the Bride's sword.It is the distinction of the two that made me want to own this set in the first place. It's been two months now and they quit getting back to me."
2,great price for decorating your home office,"Will, what do I expect?This set are strictly for decorating my office wall, etc.I would'nt take this sword do ""tameshigiri"" on it."
3,"Inane and cutesy, A Night in Venice isn't a must-listen","Like many other listeners, I wanted to be as delighted with other Strauss operettas as I was with Fledermaus, only to find that the Gypsy Baron delivers about half the inspiration and A Night in Venice about a quarter. The story and characterization are inane, and Strauss's desperation to please ends up being cutesy -- the music tries to be lilting and sparkling but without much basis.There's nothing that Schwarzkopf and company can do to resuce the banalaity they'e stuck with, but they try their best, which is saying a lot. I've never bothered to seek out a better version. This one, in decent 1954, has held the field for ove fifty years and is likely to keep on doing so."
1,Not Great!,This book is extremely basic and can be read in about an hour. Hardly worth the price for a 139 page paper back.
3,Worth reading but if you want the best read Morgan Llywelyn,"I would call ISLE OF DESTINY a work of historical fiction more than fantasy, although there are fantastic elements to the plot. But the ""historical"" part of this book seems contrary to much of what is considered accepted Celtic mythology. Flint gives well-known Celtic characters such as Sentanta (Cuchulain), Meave, Conor MacNessa, and Fergus MacRoy drastically different roles than do most of the ancient Celtic tales. These characterizations are in stark contrast to those of scholarly research or even of an author like Morgan Llewelyn, the widely acclaimed Queen of the Celtic historical/fantasy novel. This book is worth reading for a different perspective, but there are much better tellings of this same tale to be found elsewhere (especially Ms. Llywelyn's works)."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"Like many people, I first came across this book on a nineteen day canoe camping trip. It belonged to my trip leader, who later gave it to my friend. Over the past three years we have read it all the time on trail and it has provided us with an amazing perspective on our lives and our relationships with others. There are many subtle messages and even more very obvious ones that many people still overlook in everyday life. Whenever you pick up this book, just flip to a random page and read the first thing you see; I can guarantee that you'll be inspired."
4,Written in plain English,"I had been searching for a textbook for a class I am developing on health information management for an overview type seminar class. Many of the books I reviewed were so technical and a snooze to read. Marc Berg's book is written so that even a techophobe can understand the concepts he so adeptly outlines. It is a book I think students will actually READ. It is not easy to make a complex subject clear and simple, but this book does just that quite well."
1,What was that?? Just a big disappointment.,"When I bought this I thought that it was STARRING Fantasia and Faith Evans. I was sooo wrong. Faith only shows up a few times, and Fantasia only twice. At the beginning and at the end. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The storyline was too confusing because there was just too much going on. Was this about good vs. evil, a good girl gone bad, a gangsta trying to influence the girls at the caberet club, a gay owner??? Everything was too hodge podged together with no clear meaning. On top of that, the girls who were supposed to be the caberet employees never did anything but catfight and sing half of a little tune. The backdrop could have been a beauty shop or just someone's backyard because there was no point of why they were at a caberet anyways. Just plain crazy and poorly put together."
1,Don't waste your time or money,The cover of the video will get your attention. You will see Fantasia and Faith Evans and that alone will provoke you to get this video.. BUT let me warn you Looks can be deceiving.. This was more than a disappointment. I was pissed because I spent $2.39 to rent this mess. I wouldn't spend 25cents on this. Please ma'am or sir don't waste your time or money. You only see Fantasia and Faith two times maybe. The storyline was all over the place. The kittens weren't kittens they were more like bears. They were dressed poorly and some of the women in this was too big to be dresses like that. I was embrassed. I will give Nicci Gilbert credit she tried but just because you were an actor in a Tyler Perry play doesn't mean you are a playwright. I am so glad that I didn't invest my money into this project and the marketing team should be ashamed of themselves.. Totally misleading.
1,Not good,This play has poor acting. It features Fantasia Barrino (American Idol winner) and Faith Evans (R&B Singer). The two top stars only have cameo appearances and sing one song each. The remainder of the movie centers around the Gay club owner whose acting skills are not that great. The whole play was overdone as far as the acting was concerned and could have been done in alot better taste. Basically the whole play just drags on until you finally get to end which is horrible also.
2,This was not a good film,"I recently watched this dvd with a few of my friends and before it was over we all agreed that we didn't like it and it was the biggest disappointment EVER!!! We did watch the video completely in hopes that it would get better, but it never did.I'm an avid movie-watcher and I try to support African American films as much as I can but this film, this film simply SUCKED!I think that Fantasia and Faith Evans were both doing someone a favor by lending her names & faces to this project however; they should definitely be more selective in the future because a film like this can ruin their chances for being considered for real films in the future.I guess by now you know that I am not a fan of this film. Poorly written script, weak plot (if you want to say there was a plot), weak acting, and ""Yes"", weak directing.In a nutshell - ""Don't waste your time or money."""
3,COVER IS MISLEADING,"I purchased solely based on the cover's picture seemingly featuring Fantasia & Faith as headliners who were in the play only a hot minute at the very beginning. The rest of the cast seems to be doing a ""dressed rehearsal"" or ""try-outs"" with no acting skills. Take my word for it and pass."
1,What in The World?,"This was a Hot Mess, I don't know where they were trying to go with this play, but they never got there. It was just so much going on and weird storylines and thee script wasn't the best. Leave the playwriting to the professionals. David Talbert, Tyler Perry etc."
1,THE WORST PLAY I HAVE EVER SEEN,"Such an intriging title, but yet such an awful play. Being a playwright myself, this brings urban theater to shame. I bet after they were done with this they had to hide their faces because I'm sure friends and family bashed on them. The writer should take some more writing classes or just stick with Brownstone because as a playwright, they are considered a complete novice. Tata was a mess and whoever played Brandy never needs to act again. I asked my husband to turn it off of this mess because it was cruel and unusual punishment for theater lovers like myself."
1,BOOOOOOOO!!!!!!,"This was truly a waste of film and time. You would think because there are at four excellent R&B singers (Fantasia, Faith Evans, Terrell Carter, Nicci Gilbert) are in the cast, it should have been at least entertained. This was a waste. There was no concept, plot, moral of the story, nothing. It was just a bunch of watered down drama that did not connect to anything. All the way to the end of the film, I was still trying to see the point! Whom ever has watched this film already feels like they got played, by being attracted to the cover thinking we was in for a treat, Instead u got a cheesy stage with some bad acting, pointless songs, and a miscellaneous plot. This was one film that should have been shelved. Do NOT play this movie to entertain any guests. They wont be your guests anymore."
3,"Waste of time, unclear plot","I don't recommend this play. I couldn't get past the first half hour of it. Too much was going on, too many storylines, too much yelling. It was confusing. Fantasia and Faith Evans gave pretty good performances, though their appearances were brief. There was hardly any singing in this play, but like I said, I only watched the first half hour."
1,Don't waste your money,"This DVD was a HUGE disappointment. They only used Faith Evans and Fantasia's names so people would buy it. Fantasia was only seen twice while Faith was seen about 3 times. They sang at the VERY beginning and at the VERY end. The acting was below average for the whole cast, the only memorable actress was the girl who played in Players Club. She wasn't good in Players club or in here. The person who wrote/directed/produced it is Nicki Gilbert from the 90's group Browstone. She has an excellent singing voice....but you wont hear it here. She should just stick to singing and leave Musicals and play writing to the true writers out there."
2,soul kittens cabaret,it was boring somebody else told me about its not one i would keep or watch again. i will probably give it to one of my family members
1,Soul Kittens Cabaret,"While this is an ambitious musical stage play some luster is lost in the dvd format mainly because of the tacky stage settings. A bit long with only one memorable song- the ""Cabaret"" title song sung at the end credits!"
4,well written but,"nonetheless a weird and bizarre cold war spy thriller. never before writers focused on cold war would have dreamed up such weird one with black magic, hocus pocus, mumbo jumbo crap like 'grandmaster' and 'highpriest', but since remo williams, a cop who could be turned into a super natural killing machine battling evil forces, everything was possible to this no-hold-bar co-author couple. it's so weird to read these two books, making robert ludlum's tough heros lamers. the writing, plot, scenario, dialogue, structure, texture of these two books are all good, but still, i got a feeling of like reading ludlum co-authored with stephen king and some other fantasy writers. so weird and so good."
4,Grandmaster 2!!!,"This book by Warren Murphy and Molly Cochran isn't as good as the first book, Grandmaster. However, it is still a must read if you enjoyed the first.Justin Gilead and Alexander Zharkov are at it again. Along with Andrew Starcher, Justin Gilead is trying to end his circle of karma by meeting his fate with Zharkov, all while trying to keep an ex Russian president from starting world war 3. Spys, Sex, Eastern Mysticism... couldn't get much better!Why are these books not movies! Where is the third book!!"
3,Too Orchestrated,"I like the earlier Jazz Crusaders better,the strings and horns are overdone on these pieces. They are indicative of the time though and if you like heavily stringed and orchestrated jazz you will like this. I never get tired of hearing Randy Crawford singing Street Life, definitely nails it."
5,a great collection,i have dug the Crusaders for a really long time.there music has always got my full attention.as i got older i went back&heard what they were doing in the early 70's&before that&i was delighted at there depth&vibe.while i like some of there material after the mid 70's especially chain reaction&the street life album i dig there early 70's stuff far better.it has more juice to it.it is more rawer.i feel all of the musicians that are associated with this group are great.they have there own sound&feel.check this out.for lovers of Jazz&Funk&a few other styles in between.
5,A fun frolick in Vermont,"Such a pleasure to read. Story moves right along like a scenic trip down a country road. Love the characters, the dog, the renovation, the antiquing. It's nice to read a book where the hero's relatives are supportive, loving and (almost) normal. It was a hoot!"
1,Give me a break!,"I know people have the right to charge anything they like for something that is theirs but COME ON, Amazon. I'm sure you have had many hits on your site by people looking for Todd Rungren sheet music. You are a huge corporation. Contact the guy and tell him he could make a killing on a re-release of his songs as sheet music. I like the guy and have been looking for his songs on paper for a long time but I'm not paying ANYBODY $150.00 for a used book."
3,Not enough fruits,"Where's the fruit? It shows pictures of fruits on the front of the bottle, but no fruit. This is a basic synthetic vitamin with added whole food greens. This product doesn't knock my socks off."
4,Terrific nutritional supplement!,"I purchased this product after trying it out at my sister's house. It has a tart flavor with a definite iron-like aftertaste, but I actually like it straight from the bottle. My kids, however, hold their noses when drinking it and think it's disgusting. The quantity of nutiritional benefits appear to be excellent and the product is decently priced. I wish it came in a larger bottle or a 2-pack, though. Since my kids and I both take it daily, a single bottle goes fast. I am hoping to supplement my 9-year old's diet due to her aversion to veggies. So far, so good..."
4,Great Stuff,The only reason I didn't give this item another star is due to taste only. It's not the greatest taste but I have gotten used to it now. It is a wonderful product that I don't want to do without now-and it's natural! My fiance is even taking it now and loves the energy it gives him also.I take it in the morning and it gives me energy for my workday.
5,Easy purchase!,"I am using a homeopathic counselor for some health issues. One of the ingredients for my daily beverage is Nature's Plus Source of Life Liquid. To obtain this, I have to drive 35 miles (one way) in the Dallas, Texas traffic. I was delighted to be able to order this through Amazon and have it delivered to my door for less than what I was paying in Dallas!!!!! (that includes shipping).I definitely will be ordering this product again from Amazon.com"
5,Source of Life Liquid,"I loved this product. I usually take the tablets but have had a hard time taking pills as I take so many. I have fibromyalgia and this seems to give me a little more energy. The color, spinach green, throws you off, but I tastes a lot like apricots so I don't mind taking it. I just open it up and take a huge swallow. Much better than taking the pills. You should definitely try it. I think that it would be good for children."
2,Good Pruduct Painful exchanges,"We purchased 2 bottles. One was GREAT; we like the product very much. 2nd bottle had the seal opened. We tried to exchange it with seller...not happening. We tried the manufacture, Nature's Plus. While they have been nice to communicate with (unlike the seller) we still haven't been able to exchange the bottle for an unopened one. 4 months and counting. So if the bottle shows up undamaged it's a great product, otherwise their guarantee is not worth much. Sadly."
2,Not too sure yet,"I just purchased a bottle of this today. I went straight home and took the prescribed 2 tablespoons. I have been feeling totally nauseous ever since. My stomach is burning and gurgling. I'm worried I am going to get diarrhea!! YUCK! It tastes HORRID. I don't know if I dare to try it again. Seriously, it is sitting like a rock in my stomach. Blah.Okay, it's the next day. Today I took half a dose and mixed it with grape juice. It was much better that way. We'll see how it goes."
4,It tastes so bad it has to be good for you!,"I've been taking Source of Life liquid for only a month. I really think it helps me kick-start my day, and reduces my desire to drink too much coffee by giving me a mild energy boost. At first the taste was hard to take, but I'm use to it now. I find taking it just before I eat a light breakfast keeps that taste from coming back. The nutritional value is far better than any multi-vitamin I've found."
3,"not good, not bad","This is the only cd I own by this band. I'd say it is not a bad album, containing a bunch of good songs, i.e. You cannot walk here, Summertime is over, The kill or The scream, an excellent one, The garden; all of them very electronic mixing guitars; BUT, thre's always a but, the songs are perhaps too long, not excellently finished; those songs sung by de Meyer being much better, (I love his voice, imitated by miriads pf other singers), the album is, for me, not as good as Cobalt 60's Elemental of the same year. but all in all, this is not a bad album at all, it just happens that I think every song could have been potentially better. That's all. Hasta la próxima"
3,Johnson's dictionary,"A most impressive dictionary. It is not all that dated! It should not have been allowed to go out of print.The CD version is disappointing in that it is only a fair copy of a particular book. No formting was done to fit computer screens. Tipping the screen on its side helps. The search feature works and would be adequate for a pamphelet, but is painfully slow for so much data. Fast search methods have been around for decades (I have written a few myself) and one is badly needed here. The price suggests limited sales are expected, which, given my objections, will be deserved.If these can be corrected, every lover of language will want a copy. A copy is just that and reformattiong it, to me, is no sin, and would make it a more useable tool. Even with its faults, I realize it may take some time before I can close the dictionary file and get about my business. ec 27jun09."
4,Does the job,"There are not many options out there which are black in color. I first bought the Roost Edge Protectors & sent them back immediately. Then I decided to try these out. They work great, soft material and don't look garish on my kitchen table. I stuck them on my table after my toddler was tucked in bed for the night. They thus had all night to stick to the table and my toddler didn't have his attention drawn to them since he didn't see me put them on. He has not touched them and they are firmly set."
3,Does the job so far...,"I bought this for my coffee table, as my baby started standing. It does stick to the table but my baby finds ways to pull it off, he also bites it..so..so far it does the work but I will probably need to replace it soon."
2,more padding on price than furniture,"This item only seems to want to stick to perfectly square corners. If your corners are beveled, molded, or any deviation from a box corner they will pull away. I got them for the color and high rating, and thought them expensive for a cheap piece of foam. Turns out that I was right about them being expensive for a cheap piece of foam. They are not cast molded. Instead, they are an L-shaped corner bead that is cut, folded and glued to form a corner. As a result, when I taped it down to a beveled furniture corner the glue seams split. Stick to cheaper box store models; you'll get the same results for half the price."
3,Does the job,"Applied easily, seems to stay in place unless really pulled onDoes what it is should and hopefully will remove without takingthe finish off."
5,Life Saver,"I have a heavy, old wooden coffee table and every time someone held the baby near the edge, I would have a little panic attack about the ""table of death."" Mind her little fontanelle! Now that she is old enough to toddle around herself, I am relieved to find these. The adhesive is almost perfect. We have beveled corners on the table so we weren't able to get a perfect seal, so I think that on a normal table edge, they'd be super.Such a stress reliever. Now if I could only wrap the whole house in bubble wrap!"
2,Product is decent but the tape is horrible!,"First the positive -- the brown cushions fit our coffee table perfectly, will definitely protect our lil one from injury, also they are aesthetically pleasing.However, the tape is completely horrible and considering you need the cushions to stay on --this is a significant issue. Both my husband and I messed with the tape for nearly an hour before we were able to get it to stick, and even now, I am fairly certain that my daughter will be able to rip these off."
5,Reliable,Works great on our bench at the foot of our bed that kept attacking our knees as we walked by. Very impressed. Have stayed on for years. great adhesive. Does not fall off even which the daily wear & tear of sitting each day.
5,The best toy ever,"I am in love with this memory game, it is so many things at once. I bought this to show my toddler girl the different types of races and cultures, the toy is great for this because it shows different children from different countries and how they dress. When she is a little bigger I will show her to play memory with this, right now we just match the faces and I talk to her about this or that other child and where they live and what they do.Besides that the material of the toy is very good too, it is sturdy and has a soft finish, the colors are beautifull. If I were a child I would be happy to have this."
5,eeBoo memory games,I bought this product for my daughter who is developmentaly disabled. She enjoys sorting things and matching the pairs. The cards are very thick and sturdy and will hold up to many hours of handling.
5,Worth every cent............,"Long lost songs no longer played. I loved them then and I still love them now! Having smooth soul is like having your own radio station inside your home, without the nutty morning DJ's. The price is fair and if need ever be I'd buy it again. Thanks!"
5,"Classic Music, But Not a Classic Package or Value","Sonny Rollins' music for the Blue Note label has to be counted among his personal best work, and as some of the best recordings in jazz history. The albums, ""Volume One"" (see my review), ""Volume 2,"" ""Newk's Time"" and both volumes of ""A Night at the Village Vanguard"" are indisputable classics. However, buyers beware! This box set does not offer any previously unreleased material, new photos or eassys, or sumptuous packaging. Why you may ask? Because the Sonny Rollins Blue Note box set, like the Miles Davis one, is simply the five single-issue CDs, shrink-wrapped together with a card-stock cover to hold them. Folks, it ain't nothin' fancy! Since each of these albums is available individually you might as well get them that way. To boot three of the discs, both V.V. recordings and ""Volume 2"" have been reissued as 20-bit CDs in the RVG Collection. The box set has the old, regular versions. So to summarize -- box set bad, music good."
1,Missing Ingredient Sources,"The book lacks sources for key recipe ingredients, like Frank Davis's meat seasonings, and does not describe how to make your own."
4,Very nice,Great item - this along with his other CDs are great to listen to on long trips on the highway - very funny and entertaining.
4,Keillor's humor,"Keillor's sense of humor is unique and I like his ""down home"" way of putting things. He should put our a volume of different DVDs."
4,"Review of G. Keillor's CD, More Stories from L. Wobegon","I and my family thoroughly enjoy Garrison Keillor CD's. I have four of his CD's and plan to buy some more. Sometimes, as I listen to one of his CD's, I begin to feel that there actually is a Lake Wobegon and in my minds eye create an image for many of his characters, of which he of course, is the ""main character."" After all, ""who needs respect if you can be in the entertainment business"". > from Homecoming."
5,Classic Keillor,"Some of Keillor's funniest News From Lake Wobegon moments, perfect for anyone new to the writer's work and a welcome addition to every die-hard fan's Prairie Home Companion collection."
4,Humor: Stories from the Collection More News from Lake Wobegon,"This is not only funny, and I mean at times very funny. It was relaxing and interesting. It held my 19 year old daughters attention and that was nice to be able to share something our whole family could enjoy. The stories are something we all could relate to. Rare"
3,Great for a long drive,"This CD is great for a long drive, or long flight, it is entertaining and better than a book on tape. It can be a little boring at times."
3,Disappointing news,"Garrison Keillor has a wonderful way with words, but this CD was disappointing. The stories dragged on too long and sometimes with no purpose in the end or sentiment to remember. Keillor can do much better. He is usually a great story teller. He seemed to run out of steam on this 4hour tape. This will still not deter me from buying and listening to other news from Lake Wobegon."
1,The actual contents of Humor: More News from Lake Wobegon,I bought HUMOR; More News From Lake Wobegon in 2011 from Amazon. Was very disappointed that only four of the sixteen essays are on the CD. Nowhere in the description of the contents does the producers let the buyer know which essays are included on the CD. That is why I give this CD only one star.They are: Pontoon Boat / Author/ The Freedom of the Press / VicksThe total run time is 70 minutes.
4,One Two Three Four..........,"I was very happy with these dvds. Though It has been said some shows are edited. I don't like that they were, but still, there are enough laughs too keep you busy for quite some time..... One of the best tv shows ever. I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said about these shows....... Now,... It's time to release the rest of this show ..."
1,Loreena?Enya? ...they have no worries,"The Fan from Columbus who reviewed this obviosly has a tin ear (& didn't spell Loreena McKennitt's name right either)....If you like Loreena or Enya, go get Sheila Chandra or something else, but NOT Shamaneya. Shelley's voice grated at a pitch that hardly seemed very comfortable for her. She'd be better off teaming up with someone with more range. I don't usually slam recordings, but if I could send this back, I would (No fault of Amazon's tho...) From now on I'll wait to HEAR things BEFORE I buy. Oh-Go try Stellamara-Star of the sea...now THERE""S music.... (grumble, mutter)"
1,garbage,"i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, ""yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet""i just wished he'd flushed."
3,"Love Pratchett, not this","Any rating of Pratchett has to be on the Pratchett (P) scale, not on the rankings assigned to mere mortals (MM). On the MM scale, this scores six out of five. Comparing P to P, it barely rises to ordinary, despite the potential it started with.Eric is the archetypal geek boy. He has employs precocious mastery of the most dangerous technologies Discworld has to offer - google ""Radioactive boyscout"" for analogies. Also, he isn't too up on the boy/girl thing despite his overheated interest in whatever it might be. So, when he hacks his way into almost the right space-time continuum, he summons Rincewind: refugee extraordinaire.The usual crew appear only in the person of Death - the Crasher of Every Party - Rincewind, and the Luggage. (Not so keen on R, but L keeps me coming back.) Discworld has me as a return customer, but this book isn't the reason.- wiredweird"
2,not my cup of tea,"i usually am a humble slave of all terry pratchett books - simply relishing each book. i didnt like this one. it didnt flow as well as the others. i frequently asked myself how one part of the story led to another. it just didnt make sense to me in parts. what more, i find eric really annoying. in summary, i was disappointed with this book. i wouldnt recommend it. its not one of terry pratchett's better books. buy mort, small gods, or the truth. those made me fall in love with the discworld series."
5,Eric,"Looked brand new! Got it for my boyfriend who is a huge Terry Pratchett fan, and he enjoyed the book."
3,"Not the best Discworld Novel, but still entertaining","Definitely not the best of the Discworld series. However, it is still a quick and entertaining read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Or, Rincewind goes to Hell. In other words, Pratchett has decided to again spoof another couple of pieces of writing.A young lad wants to do the whole power, fame, women, etc. thing and tries to summon a demon. Much to his disappointment, he gets Rincewind.You also get Death, the Librarian, the Luggage, and a parrot."
3,Point being???,"Im not too sure what the point of this book was. OK, we needed to get Rincewind out of the Dungeon Dimensions, but this book seemed like a filler so PTerry had more time to write Moving Pictures. The Pratchett magic wasn't in this one, but I did like some of the bits with the demons."
2,Don't worry-- the whole series isn't like this.,"Let's be frank. <i>Eric</i> is easily the least of the Discworld novels, both in length and in quality.Perhaps it's because Pratchett was trying to mimick the pessimistic style of his friend Douglas Adams (this is especially apparent when Rincewind and Eric meet the Creator of the universe). Perhaps it's because the ""plot"" is an incoherent series of wacky, madcap adventures. Perhaps it's because the main character is Rincewind, who despite his status as a fan favorite is less likeable than any other Discworld protagonist. Perhaps it's the lack of a strong villain to tie it all together. In any event, <i>Eric</i> manages to belittle Pratchett's powerful vision, turning what might have been a glimpse into the history of the Discworld into a cut-rate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.If you're a budding Pratchett fan, you'll have to read this sooner or later. Just don't expect it to approach the quality of <i>Feet of Clay</i> or <i>Soul Music</i>."
3,Only fairly funny,"Only fairly funny are rather damning words when applied to any work by Pratchett who is one of the most amusing writers alive. Usually quite funny while being profound and dealing with some of existence's questions, Eric is one of the novels that is not a can't-put-it-down experience. Yes, some nice commentary about the hellishness of modern management. Yes, Rincewind and the Luggage once again run for their lives. It's the sort of novel one must read because it is Pratchett and there are some enjoyable moments. Because it is Pratchett it's better than loads of other things one might read- it's just not the best Pratchett. But of course, worth a read just because."
4,Superb!,"I have read 10 of Terry Pratchett's books and I have to say this is one of the best so far, its short and sweet and is not to boring. I especially like the bit in hell, but Iam suprised to see that the luggage wasn't used more in the story, anyway, I say read this now!"
2,What a Disappointment....,"I picked up Eric, utterly delighted to be able to find a Pratchett (any Pratchett would have done, I thought) and 45 minutes later put it down with the heaviness of utter discouragement. Yeah, the jokes are there; the humor is there; but the plot (whups, didn't see one of those in there, sorry) was pitiful and so much more could have been done with Eric!!!! A lustful 13-yr old demonologist that happens to get successful? sheesh!C'mon, Terry--we all know you can do better than this. Let's get the older ones back in print; Equal Rites, Guards!Guards!, and so forth!"
2,The Dregs of Discworld,"I have enjoyed most of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books, so the very poor quality of this one came as quite a shock. _Eric_ has no real depth and includes no substantial development of Discworld or any of its inhabitants. Yes, there are occasional humorous elements, but they all feel like cheap rehashing of material from earlier in the series.I wouldn't exactly say that I disliked the book; it was more of a ""null"" experience that didn't make any noticable impression on me at all. That's far below par for Pratchett, and it makes reading the book a waste of time (even though it is mercifully short).In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Even if you want to read the whole Discworld series, don't bother with _Eric_. Rincewind is back in the primary world, and the rest of the story is just filler."
2,Adds nothing to the Faust story,"ERIC is one of the few total misfires in the Discworld series. In taking on the Faust story, Pratchett adds nothing to it, creating a forgettable, Faust-lite character in a teen aged Eric who thinks Rincewind (For reasons that stem fromSourcery) is the demon who will grant his wishes. Using the Faust template seems to be a natural for Pratchett but doesn't work in this book. The plot is wafer thin and the humor seems forced, often the problem when Rincewind is present in any capacity. When a series runs for awhile the quality can ebb and flow, this is definitely an ebb tide book."
3,Something seems to be missing,I just read some of the other reviews and now know this was originally a graphic novel. That explains why while reading this book I thought something was missing. I never figured out the point of this book. It is hilarious with Pratchett's brilliant word play. But again I definitely felt like something was missing with the plot and no point to the story. Don't start with this book if you haven't ever read a Disc World book.
2,his worst book by far,"All humorists have their off-days, but ERIC must represent something like an off-year for Pratchett. There are Pratchett books that have only one joke, and stretch it to a limit far past most readers' patience, like MOVING PICTURES, but this one has ZERO humor, it is about nothing, has no characters the reader would care anything about, veers mindlessly from pointless episode to pointless episode, and basically leaves the reader cheated and annoyed."
4,This is more like it,"Anyone looking for proof that Pratchett was getting sick of Rincewind need look no further than the fact that he took 4 books to drag his inept protagonist out of Hell. Since he does it through a Faust wannabe, Pratchett has a great time in poking fun at both fantasy conventions and classic literature. When Helen of Troy shows up with a pack of children trailing behind her, Pratchett is at his best.This is a shorter book than most, and Pratchett really doesn't like Rincewind, but it moves along nicely. The demon plotting and counterplotting in order to retrieve Eric is hilarious and the fulfilment of the Faustian wishes of course goes awry, but it has a great way of going awry."
5,great book,Preston Blair does it again - another fine instructional guide on animation.I wish his books never went out of print -- It was challenging to find the predecessor to this book (Animation I).
3,"Not bad, but strictly for Dru fans","Sisqo's second release, Return of Dragon, is no doubt a good cd. Sisqo is one of the most talented r+b artists out there, able to make recycled Booty-tunes sound melodic. But on his sophmore release he tends to mimick his own style very often. Few songs really stand out, aside from the upbeat ""Last Night"", through which Sisqo is trying to repeat the success of last years overplayed ""Thong Song"". In fact, there is no evidence of any cut that would repeat the success of that song. Even the current single ""Can I Live"" seems recycled and really doesnt bring anything new to Sisqo's arsenal. Alltogether, this album tops his debut, which included a lot of filler songs. Sisqo wont lose many fans with this album, but he shouldnt look to gain any new ones. Credit Sisqo with sticking to his trademark style, but without any evident Thong Songs, and little growth as an artist, the listener qucikly finds the album-- dare i say-- draggin'?"
5,THE DRAGON IS BACK,"if you dint have this cd,GO GET IT.in my opinion it is better than unleash.it has sounds like you never heard before.and much more dance songs than the last.and when he does the slow songs like""close your eyes""itll make you cry. i suggest you go get it now."
3,"It's pretty tight, but I expected more from Sisqo","Well it's not thong song and I guess you can't expect it to be neither, He did well on this cd, but I just feel he could have had at least more ballads. The n--ga is talented but I'm not feeling hime too much on this one. As far as creativety goes he has it, it's there, vocally, the boy is bad, I just expected more, ya know. I still think Dru Hill needs to get back together and give us the stuff we all know and love, and I guess Sisqo is doing his own thing right now so that's why things sound the way they do, and aint' nothing wrong wit' that. Overall the album is tight though, but I'm still looking for Dru Hill. From one singer to another it's still bangin' though."
1,"Men, what kind of CD did Sisqo made!!!???","Dear Sisqo,Men this CD sucks. I only liked Can I live that's it. other songs are trash. if your planning to buy it, don't buy it. I recomed it to buy new R.kelly, or wait untill Craig Daivis comes out his R&B styles are really diffrent from other artists. or if you want good RAP CD go get D12, they are really good."
3,ok,"I only very recently got this cd. I didnt love or hate it. It could have been longer. The problem with Sisqo is that he needs to be toned down some. Lose the colorful hair, the braids and all the flipping and you'll have a great artist. He has the voice and the body. Not too bad looking either. All he needs is great material and he'll turn it out. The market is over saturated with mediocre singers - male & female. He could be the total package if somebody would just take the time to mold him. Give him that one great song and I truly believe he would blow everybody else out the water!!"
4,A unknown goodie,"Sadly, this CD did get much publicity and most people don't know about it. This CD was probably the best of the two Sisqo CDs that were released, the first was only good because of the Thong Song hit. On this CD, Sisqo really shows his talent, in creating beats and his lyrics. The beats will surely have you dancing, and it will bring back Sisqo memories. This CD is an oldie but goodie, and I suggest picking it up."
3,Okay,"I truly don't know what possessed me to buy this when it was released, I guess I liked ""Dance For Me"", but it turns out it wasn't so bad. ""Dance For Me"" was obviously the best song, better than anything on his first album I'm pretty sure. Some of the first tracks were good, like ""Not Afraid"" and ""Infatuated"". The first single was ""Can I Live"", a pretty good slower track. The collaboration with Dru Hill is good too, a lot like the music he recorded with them. A lot of the middle songs are pretty forgettable. The song with the rap group ""The Associates"" would be a pretty good rap song if those guys had anything to say. It looks like Sisqo is going to the oblivion of the forgotten R&B star, which is kind of too bad, because he did make a few songs worth remembering, especially with Dru Hill. This album probably isn't worth buying for most people that aren't Sisqo fans, but it isn't that bad."
3,Ego,"I was and still am a Dru Hill fan but when Sisqo got the bighead it really hurt his fellow group members. His first solo cd Incomplete was a smash album but when he started challenging other artist to a sing and danceoff his career went straight down the pipe. He sold seven million albums on that album and then on the next I don't think he sold 10,000. What does that tell you loyal fans? I know it tells me for Sisqo to have seven million fans and then drop down to 10,000 says that he released a negative dragon. Now that he is no longer on top, I bet he is very humble at this point because the reality of it is is that your no longer the talk of the town and your only as good as you last record Sisqo. Be humble and never think your to good to fall."
3,Not that bad actually,"After the huge success with his debut album ""unleash the dragon"" i guess many though that this would be just as good or even better, in 2000 Sisqo was defenitely on top of most r&b charts. This second album however was a failure compared to his first one, but it's not that bad actually, itincludes 10 songs(only) and there are some classic uptempo songs with fast beats and backround voices just as always like ""Not Afraid"" ""Infatuated"" and the best song of the album, ""Dance for me"" almost as good s ""Thong song"". Ballads are there too ""Close your eyes"" I don't know why the album still failed, maybe he was too fast to release it or maybe the material was too simular to the previous one, however i found it decent."
3,"not as good as his first, but good sophmore album","I would actually rate this three and a half stars. There's more R&B on this album than on his first, which is fine with me, but if you're looking for a song to be the next ""Thong Song"", you're going to be disappointed. In my opinion, the two best songs on the album are ""Can I Live"" and ""Dream"". I think that one of the best parts about this album is that as successful as ""Unleash the Dragon""was, Sisqo is experinmenting with a totally different sound from what was on that album."
3,"Not as good as Unleash the Dragon, but very good","My favorite song from Sisqo's last album was, like many others, the ""Thong Song"". If you're looking for the next ""Thong Song"", you're going to be disappointed, because this album is almost entirely R&B. I would actually like to rate this album 31/2 stars because I like R&B. If you like R&B like me, I would reccomend getting this album."
1,I'm glad Dru Hill reunited,"""Can I live"" is the only song that does anything to me. I will admit I haven't heard this album in over a year and a half. That should say something to you."
3,I don't see how he could have topped Unleashed.,"Unleash the Dragon was a great album. This is mediocre at best. First, there aren't near enough tracks(only ten if you take out the interludes). Second, of those ten tracks, there are only a few songs that catch my attention. ""Dance For Me"" and ""Homewrecker"" are both pretty good songs, but they also both sound a lot like ""Thong Song"" from his last album. My favorite song on the album is ""Off The Corner"" feat The Associates. I might be a little biased though because my favorite genre of music is rap and this is really the only rap song on the album. The last song that I like on here is ""Without You"" feat Dru Hill. Overall, I think that this was definitely a disappointing album based on the high quality of Sisqo's first. I don't think that it will hurt his career that much though because people still remember his ""Thong Song"". If his next album isn't better though, his career could start going into a major tail-spin."
4,Well Worth Your Money,"This CD is definately worth the price I paid for it.Sisqo has a great singing voice. The album was well done.Some of the phatest tracks are ""Can I Live,"" ""Infatuated,"" ""Homewrecker,"" and ""Not Afraid."" The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the lyrics are crappy and don't make a lot of sense. Still, I think you'd be making a bad decision if you don't purchase this CD."
1,"A giant, bloated mess.","This album sums up almost everything that's wrong with modern r&b: talk-show lyrics, oversinging, and shallow macho posing. Sisqo clearly has the voice, but his ego runs amok on this CD. I didn't care for his last album, but at least he showed some promise. I'm not so sure this time around. This record flopped almost immediately after the release, and one listen is all it takes for you to see why."
1,You've got to be kidding.,"I was so excited when I bought this album. When I heard it, the first thing that came to my mind was, ""What the ****?"""
2,SISQO'S RETURN OF DRAGON,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT, I KEPT HEARING SISQO SAY IN DIFFRENT INTERVIEWS, THAT THIS ALBUM WAS TOTALLY DIFFRENT THAN ANYTHING OUT NOW. LIKE WHEN MICHAEL JACKSON CAME OUT WITH THRILLER IN 1982. THIS ALBUM IS NO THRILLER, AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT REALLY STANDS OUT, (LIKE THE BREAK OUT MEGA HIT THONG SONG). THIS ALBUM FEELS RUSHED AND GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC TO FAST. SISQO WANTED TO GET THIS ALBUM OUT FAST BEFORE THE UN STEADY POP FANS OF AMERICA FORGOT ABOUT HIM. STILL IN ALL THERE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS ON HIS SECOND ALBUM. ""CAN I LIVE"" IS DIFFENTLY A HOT ONE, INFATUATED WILL GET YOU OUT YOU CHAIR. THEN THE IS THE THE THONG SONG REMAKE IN ""DANCE WITH ME"" WHICH SHOULD HAVE STAYED LOCKED IN THE DRAGONS LAYER. FOR SISQO FAN'S THIS ALBUM WILL PLEASE THEM, AS FOR SISQO BREAKING NEW GROUND AND REDEFINING THE POP WORLD AND MUSIC AS WHOLE (LIKE MIKE DID WITH THRILLER)BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME."
3,i expected more from sisqo,"sisqo's first album was pretty good, but his sophmore album isnt as good. half the tracks sound the same, but there are a couple of other good tracks, CAN I LIVE and INFATUATED and LAST NIGHT are the best tracks on the cd. not many tracks are that good. SISQO tries too hard on this cd, he tires to rap and sing r&b but almost all the songs sounds like pop. c;mon sisqo we all know you can do better then this."
3,good album,"sisqo is back with return of dragon a follow up of his sophmore album unleash the dragon. i think return of dragon is better than unleash the dragon for the fact it has more rap and not as many love songs as the first won did. but dont get me wrong there are some love ballads on this such as dream and close your eyes. but the songs that i really like are off the corner,can i live and not afraid. this is a pretty good album so i reccomend it."
4,Kudos To Sisqo!,"Wow, I commend Sisqo for returning with avengence on his sophmore effort. Not only do you get his latest singles ""Can I Live"" and ""Dance For Me"" (which sounds relatively close to ""The Thong Song"") there are also great dance numbers such as ""Last Night"" and meaningful ballads like ""Close Your Eyes"" and ""Dream"". Don't expect this told hold the torch to his debut album, but still, this is one hell of an effort."
5,adults only,i feel the cd is for adults only no kids should not be able to listen to the cd unless there parents agree to it something are left better unsaid
1,What a disappointment!,"I got this cd as a birthday gift and I have to say I'm so glad I didn't pay for it. It's a total disappointment, he rambles and screams to the point where it's not longer music but just chaotic noise!!He recently said on the video show "" 106 & park"" that he would ""beat"" any R & B male singer that crossed his path.Sisqo, sit down and shut up because you are no match for the likes of Gerald Levert, D'Angelo, Dave Hollister, or even new-comer Jaheim for that matter, and the list goes on and on.Personally, I think we gave him too much credit with the first CD. Now he's got a swelled head and thinks he can just throw anything on a CD and call it music! HaHa! What a joke!Go back to Dru Hill! You've lost your Midas touch!"
2,where's the soul?!?,"Everybody is on here saying ""I love it, because all these songs are so up tempo!"" Yeah, AND?!? Who wants EVERY song to be up tempo? What's wrong with and little soul? All this new dance R&B [junk] is boring and tired. If you don't believe me, turn on the radio and see how many times they play Jagged Edge's ""Where's The Party At"" and 112 ""Peaches and Cream"".These dance R&B songs are ok every now and then, but Dru Hill, and Sisqo as a solo artist, have potential to be such great soulful artist, and now it seems as he's bought into the hype of all this new stuff, and he's lost his roots. I just hope that when Dru Hill releases their next album, they get back to what they are really good at."
3,Dissappointing,"Sisqo stunned the world with Unleash the Dragon, and expectations were high for his second CD. I hate to say that it did not fulfill them, or at least mine. Every song on Unleash the Dragon was brilliant. On Return of Dragon, Sisqo's sophomore album, the songs are just that. Sophomoric. Songs like Can I Live, Close Your Eyes, Off the Corner, and Dream are the only shining stars here. Sisqo can still blow, but this CD will not blow you away."
5,not a fan,"sisqo, where to begin. Not only did i not like sisqo before this cd, i absolutely hated his release, ""the thong song"" and i am an 18 year old party hopper. yet a friend insisted i listen to the cd and i did and it has been in my cd changer ever since... last night, infatuated, can i live, close your eyes are all extremely good songs and last night gets the girls jumping. nice work sisqo my props to you"
3,ITS AIIHT...COULD'VE BEEN TYHTER,Sisqo said that he will take any R&B cat down on BET. I dunno...i really got alot of luv 4 him. Usher iz on top right now...so i dunno how he can say that. Usher has been trippin eva since! Hes confused like i am. 4 DIEHARD FANZ ONLY!
2,not enuff flame,sorry not feeling it man whoever said sisqo's the next prince need to seriously put the pipe down.
2,=(,"I love sisqo to death but sadly I was disappointed with this album. There wasn't enough singing and like the rest of the world has noticed he's fallen into *lets talk and ad-lib a bit* I only truely find Without you and Dream possible to listen to because thats when you hear the true range of his voice as opposed to him chatting to one of his friends. I loved Dru Hill too and I think he should take some time out from being ""the dragon"" and go back to being Dru Nasty cos he fits in so much better without the ""this is for my haters"" attitude."
3,NOT THAT GOOD,this album was good..Anticipated this release and was excited to see what good material he came up with...considering the debut solo album was hot..this was such a DUD...CAN I LIVE the first single and basically only good song on here..Sisqo trying to be too edgy and wild....im glad Dru HIll got back together even though they're debut only get 3 and a half to four stras itself....May be Sisqo should try to stick to Dru hill until he is truly ready for another solo album
1,I cant beleive this but this CD absolutely sux,This could be one of the worst CD's ever created by an R & B artist.thier is only one good song on this disc and that one is not even that sweet.the rest of the CD just completely sucked .A one hit wonder is his name.
4,Excellent bible study,"Taking just a few verses at a time, this book made bible study easy to fit in a busy scedule for this working mom. Even though the lesson was fairly easy to study each week, it amazed me at how much you gain by going over the same few verses over and over and really getting down to the meaning and application it may have in our lives. I found it very easy to understand and I as well as the rest of the women in my bible study have really enjoyed this study."
5,great study guide,"Great indepth study and perfect for small group, even for men or mixed group. Leads to good discussion as well."
3,Definitely Different,"I love ""Back To My Roots"" the only song I know that's all about Black Hair Styles. Also, I love the references Ru made to the movie ""Paris Is Burning"" in her song ""Supermodel"" you know the (""Shante, shante, shante, part"").Can I also add that this CD is groundbreaking. RuPaul was doing ""Happy Hardcore"" music a la ""Everybody Dance"" years before there was a term for it in the rave scene."
5,Jake and the Fat Man,I can remember seeing this series when it was on TV. While I missed a lot of episodes then now I have had the chance to purchase both volumes of Season one of this series. Joe Penny is great as is William Conrad as the tough DA.
5,ScoopFree is scoop free!,"Been using this product for several years with our older cat...it lasted close to a month. When we adopted two kittens, now giving us 3, I found the 1 month went down to a little over 1 week - which is what is stated. Keeps the odor down and makes life easer. I use it with the ScoopFree litter box. I did run out and used a similar product -- it didn't last a week and didn't keep the odor down -- was glad when my order came in and I was back to using the scoop free"
3,Convenient but pricey,This product is awesome especially if you're not great about cleaning the box...I have 2 cats and end up changing the filter about once every 8/9 days......so the biggest problem is the price.......very pricey!! I spend about $60/month for the replaceable trays....ugggg
3,"Great product, too expensive","Gets the job done. Wished it lasted longer and it wasn't so expensive. If the cost was cut in half, or it lasted twice as long, this would get 5 stars."
1,Litter Trays,Costly! Love the ltterbox but started using the reusable plastic Forever tray. It works great and cost less than 1/3 of tthese tyrays. I have tried to get out of this auto ship but they sent it again anyway. Anyone know how I can get them to stop sending and charging me for these?
5,Litter trays refills,"This is so easy to use with the automatic litter box. With 2 cats it has to be changed about every 10 days. It doesn't leak or have a a discernible odor. I have used litter boxes for my cats for many years and this by far the best way to tend to the box. It is, however, rather expensive but the ease of use makes it worthwhile."
1,Convenient Expensive Estimate is a fraud,"Brilliant Pet, the company that makes this product CLAIMS: ""We recommend replacing the litter tray at least once every 20-30 days for one cat."" This is at best a generous estimate. I think it's outright fraud. I have one eight-pound cat and I end up changing the box every week. I change it when the litter turns yellow and is wet because at that point, the smell is terrible. This is NOT a good deal. The price has been going up steadily for the refills. The litter box itself is good. It's quiet. The rake isn't great because cat poo sticks to it. But it is quiet. I wish this were a better product. I also have noticed that the amount of dust in the litter has gone up. This worries me quite a bit because I breathe it when I pour it in, but my poor cat breathes it every time he digs in."
1,great idea - results costly and unsatisfying,Idea seems great but the truth is that the box still smells you still have to clean it out b/c your pet may urinate on the side. This item is very costly b/c I have to replace the tray every other week for my one cat instead of every 4 weeks. I tried to return the box within the 90 days but you get a customer service person who is suppose to send you an e-mail on how to return it (which I did not recieve)there is no follow through.
2,Seriously??,"I read the reviews, I researched, I bought. . . Disappointment. I have one cat, and feed him good food with no fillers which should help with excessive elimination/odor (or so I was told). The scoop-free unit works well, BUT the odor is at times unbearable! The solid waste is swept away, but the urine just sits and, well - puddles! Am I doing something wrong? Even with frequent stirring, the urine is not absorbed by the crystals. Do I have a bad batch of crystal trays??? Seems that if I have to change the tray at the end of a brief two weeks, SOMEthing isn't working!!!"
2,What a price for convenience!,"I bought this system just before Christmas for our two cats. While it significantly reduces the odor and the mess, we go through one cartridge every week to 10 days. With a 6-pack of refills costing about $100 plus shipping, that means I am spending over $50 per month (and possibly up to almost $70!) on CAT LITTER! There is absolutely NO WAY this product costs more than a few dollars each to make. While I really like the product, I really dislike the price, and if the pricing doesn't go down in the next couple of months, I will be looking at other brands/options."
5,Much better than the off-brand!,"I have been using this for years with my cat, Ricky. One tray refill lasts about 3 weeks with him. So, six trays will last quite a while. I really like this product a lot. It traps the odor and does an effective job. I keep this item in my cart at all times and monitor the price. When it drops, I buy it. For example, on May 11, 2010 it was $85.43... which is $14.24 per tray. Great price, so I bought it. Most of the time, I see the price hovering around $99... so when the price drops, you need to snag it!In regards to knock-offs... I tried twice another brand. That brand did not trap the odor and the litter smell was gross. The tray only lasted two weeks. I went back to Fresh Step Crystals/ScoopFree litter trays and will not buy an off-brand again.I hope this review helps you make your decision. Thank you!"
1,"Love it in theory, but cartridge only lasts one week. $$$","In theory, this is a great litter system. However, each cartridge lasts me only one week. The price is way too high!!"
4,"I like it, but it's not quite as advertised...","This product certainly beats traditional litter options, however.... it won't last 30 days as they suggest. I have one cat, just an average female and ""IF"" I scoop the poop every day or two, and add a good 3 cups of additional litter crystals (there's not enough in te bag they provide with each tray) I can get about 15 to (I've tollerated it) to 18 days. After 18 days, and that's WITH scooping the poop and adding litter... well, it's pretty rank. Don't get me wrong, it beats traditional litter maintenance, just know that you have maybe 10 days ""as is"" and can push it to 15 oto 18 days with my suggestions."
4,Easy to use,Very easy to install and change. The crystals need to be stirred every three or four days. Other than that there is nothing you need to do.
2,Great price for a so-so product,"I was very happy with Amazon's price on this item, but we ultimately stopped using the litterbox because it just couldn't handle our kitty - we were changing it on a weekly basis and even that wasn't enough."
2,Change every 30 days is a total scam,I have 2 cats and have to change the catridge every 7 days. I tried everything but the smell just became unbearable in 7 days. The catridge are expensive - $99 for 6. It is also very noisy. Check some [...] videos to see if you can bear the noise before buying. The catridge leaks if left for too long (like 10 days).
2,Not for me,Way too expensive and it's easier to just clean the litter myself. This system just doesn't do it for me.
4,good product,"A bit heavy with the 6 pack, but very handy to have around. Wish you could use other litter with the boxes, though."
2,Scoop Free Litter Cartridges,I have been very unhappy with the last two orders I have gotten. The metal pieces on the boxes have not been aligned very well with the littler box top and I have had to work on them to get them to work. I don't know if I will order these again from this seller.
3,Multiple cat household,"The manufacturer touts the litter refill as being able to last 30 days for one cat. So if you have two cats, you should be able to expect about 15 days, right? Nope, try about a week. A week. Not at all what I expected.On the + side, it controls odors very well, and it doesn't track very much."
3,Could be better,I love the idea of the automatic litter box but mine broke after only a few months. Now the light just blinks and I have to push it in order for it to rake the litter. The whole point of it was to make my cat's lives better when I'm not around but now that's not happening. I also scoop out what does get raked into the holding box every couple days since there is a smell.The litter itself is ok. It doesn't really absorb the cat urine so I try to scoop that out when I clean their box. I may try filling the cartridge with a different litter next time to see if that will work. I think clumping litter would be better anyway since it would get raked into the box and be easier to get rid of the smell.
3,Not Exactly what I expected but better than other litter boxes.,"I have three cats and I bought 2 of these boxes. My cat's absolutely REFUSED to used the one with the lid so that was a waste of money. The litter trays work okay but it's taken the cat's awhile to get used to them. I end of changing the one they use the most every week (7 days) and I even add a little extra crystal litter to the tray to soak up urine. The other one is every two weeks but I do need to use the pooper scooper to clean out ""deposit end"" to have enough room and reduce smell. Maybe my cats just have IBS! These do look infinitely better than the regular old litter boxes and don't take anything at all to change.I just have to order the refills fromm Amazon because no one sells them around here!"
3,Convenient but not cheaper,"These cartridges are probably more convenient than buying bags of cat litter but are definitely not cheaper than bags. Although they are advertised as lasting 4 weeks, we change the cartridge every 2 weeks and we only have one cat. Also, we had urine leak through the cardboard cartridge which created quite a mess. It appears the crystals kind of help to dry up the poop which helps in the scooping of it. Yes, you still need to scoop it out but that is actually a review of the litter box, not the litter."
3,It is Expensive!,"Otherwise it is better than scooping! The program requires 14 more words to submit this, so let me say again, it is better than scooping."
3,scoopfree litter tray refills,They don't last as long as they say and I only have 1 cat. The product is good just wish it laste longer.
1,Wrong item. Two attempts!,This item was supposed to be a 6 pk of refills. The firstShipment was 1 refill. I called amazon and the only resolutionWas to return it and reorder. The reorder arrived and it was 1 refill.I returned it and gave up. Amazon was great about working withMe and credited my account pretty quickly afterI called. This was really just a hassle having to call amazon twice and packageUp and return 2 items.
2,Wasn't really 6 trays,"It looks like the company may have fixed it now, but when I ordered it was really cheap for 6 trays with ridiculously expensive shipping, I figured it evened out to still be the cheapest per tray, so I ordered it. To my surprise, only one tray showed up to my door. The company refunded the shipping costs after I complained, but the price for the one was not any better than the other companies I could have purchases from after that. At least the company worked with me though. Good customer service."
1,They have changed something...,"I have had my ScoopFree litter box for several years and have used these trays almost the entire time. My local pet store carried an aftermarket brand for a while, but has since switched back to this brand. The company has obviously changed something recently. I have two cats, and one tray used to last me around two weeks. Now, the smell is unbearable after just a couple of days. The cardboard trays gets soaked through with urine so you'll have to make sure you put a plastic bag underneath. Even with that, the bag gets covered in urine and it seeps under the bottom of the litter box and just makes the entire thing disgusting.In the past I would have given them 4 or 5 stars, but there is no justifying the price given such a huge decrease in quality. Honestly, it is so bad now I wouldn't use this if they were free. I live with a roommate and have to keep the litter box in the closet in my bedroom. The smell is just... horrible."
3,Crystal will be all over your house,"Our cat somehow drags these crystals out of the box and all over our house every single day. We vacuum constantly but nothing seems to work. And our cat doesn't even cover his poop. He does his business and then scratches the inside of the machine not even touching the litter. Yes, somewhat strange behavior.So there is no logical reason why this litter sticks to his feet and finds its way all over the carpet and tile everywhere in our home...but it does. We step on it every single day and it hurts and is pretty disgusting knowing it is possibly urine or feces-coated litter we're stepping on.There doesn't seem to be a perfect automatic litter box out there. This one has its advantages but the litter all over our home is enough to have us searching right now for a new machine."
4,Perfect for people on the go!,While I agree it is expensive. It is really easy and quick. I have found that I can get two weeks with two cats. So every other week on trash day I take it out and I have no odors nor do I have to scoop the box. This is also better than the other type of automatic liter boxes because it doesn't get jammed. I would give it a 5 except the price is still a little high in my opinion. I also wish that amazon would put it in their subscribe and save section too.
5,My Cats are Happy Again,"I've used ScoopFree for several years and it's worked like a charm. I ran into a huge problem, about a year ago, when another company (LitterMaid) started selling FAKE ScoopFree trays and the local pet store stopped carrying the real thing. That was a huge nightmare - my cat stopped using the box - she'd leave ""packages"" all over the place, the box leaked, and the odor was unreal. In desperation, I found that I could buy replacement trays on Amazon and that they were less expensive than any other source. My cats (I've since got a second one) are now very happy again and so am I. The important thing is to make sure you buy the real ScoopFree trays as the fake ones are a nightmare."
4,ScoopFree Trays,"I have been using these trays for about a year now and they do a great job of controlling the smell and they are very easy to change out, which I like. However, the cost seems a bit much and also they do not last 30 days. I have 2 boxes each used by one cat and can only get two weeks at most out of them."
3,Not what they used to be,"Last time I purchased these the litter provided had a scent to it. The ones I received did not. When did this change?Pros- Very convienent.Cons- No scent litter, started to smell after 1 week."
2,too expensive for something not perfect,"This worked for a few months, and then it stopped working and just turned into an expensive littlebox.The trays are really expensive so I would expect it to work better.The sensor stopped working and so we reverted to pressing the button manually every morning and evening..Maybe our cats poo alot, but I felt that maybe it should be bigger.. Or maybe it was just never meant for 2 large maincoons.6 months later, we bought a large $20 litterbox that we just shovel manually.to summarize, when it worked, it was great, but when it stopped working, it was just money down the toilet so t speak. I would not waste your money.."
1,PS to complaint ????????????????,"This is a PS to my ??????????????? review. I can't believe I can't get the crystals delivered to my door.......my response from Scoopfree is to get the cartridges. NO. Don't they sell the crystals? A helpful hint. I did buy the forever litter tray and it's the best. Now I need to find out where to get crystals that work as well (I hope) as scoop free's crystal litter. I would send the box back except is is the best product I've ever bought. I do cheat and remove POOP, thus the litter last a full month for my one cat.I am very disappointed in Scoopfree for not letting me know what's up with the crystals....................."
4,Less Stinky Then the rest,"I have to say that cleaning up after my cat has gotten a lot easier with these litter cartridges for my auto cat box. I have one cat and the litter cartridge lasts almost 30 days, but that all depends on how humid it is outside and in my house. When it's a nasty rainy day outside you can sometimes smell the litter box regardless if it has been 5 or 15 days. Since the crystals work by absorbing and de humidifying the pee and poop, humid weather doesn't really help the crystals at all.But I have to say I am really happy with this cat llitter system and find that it is the best one out there so far. Now if they can only find a way to stop the crystals from sricking to my cats paws so he doesn't track it all over the house that would be great. This litter gets tracked around the house and outside of the litter box much less than clumping litter, Oh get the litter mat, that is deff worth it, it does help."
4,Marlee's Scoop Free Litter Box Cartridge Review,I have two cats and prior to getting the Scoop Free Automatic Litter BoxI was having to scoop out the litter box every 2-3 days. If I didn't myhouse smelled like a litter box. Except for the fact that I have one smelly cat the reduction in odor is phenomenal.
4,Great product,The litter refills are fast and easy to change. With 2 cats I have to change the cartridge approximately every 10 days. Wish it lasted longer!
4,makes litter a lot easier,"I use the scoop free litter cartridges for a 15 lb. cat. while they do not last 30 days, it makes litter cleanup a lot easier and it does not smell"
5,Scoop Free Cartridge Review,Product delivered in a timely fashion. It performs as advertised and is quite a convenience. The price on Amazon was the lowest I could find.
3,"System works well, with 1 cat","This worked well with the system for 1 cat. We had one older cat who pee'd alot so this helped the smell. However when she passed, and we adopted two male cats this litter box could not keep up. We were changing the trays every 5 days. Not practical in the long run (cost wise)"
1,"DO NOT ORDER - they cannot get the order straight, but only deliver a single tray","What ever you do, do not order this product! The ScoopFree Trays are great, but the fulfillment process could not get the order straight even after two attempts.I have used the trays for over 5 years now and like the convenience and way the system works. I ordered the ScoopFree Litter Tray Refills with Premium Blue Crystals, Pack of 6 and the order came with only one tray. I thought this was a simple mistake, so I went through the inconvenient process of returning the original order and submitted a second order. The second order came again with only one of the pack of six trays that I ordered. To compound the frustration, there is no efficient way to return an order that was messed up, no chat or phone number or other way to communicate the problem to a human. A single tray costs only $15, not $89."
4,Expensive but effective,I've been using these refills with my Scoopfree litterbox for a year now. It is very expensive but better than scooping litter multiple times per day myself. I keep the box near my bed and I do not notice any odor. The crystal also hurts to walk on it barefoot. More than traditional litter.
5,kitty and user friendly,Sometimes now my cat prefers to use his litter box instead of going outside since the litter stays fresh and clean. No more handling cat poop! Nice!
4,Great but doesn't last a month,"I love this whole litterbox system, but I find I have to change it every 2 1/2 weeks instead of every month. I only have one cat and he is a tad overweight, so that may account for the frequent changes. I wihs you could buy these refills is the grocery store or at Wal-Mart or Target, but they work well. Absolutely no odor until it's time to change!"
4,scoop free litter tray refills 6,Very easy to change. It is care free for at least a month unless you have more than 1 cat.
3,It's Okay,"This is a decent product. Doesn't really last as long as it should. I give it 2 weeks tops for ""freshness""."
4,ScoopFree Litter Tray Refill...Backorder until Feb 2013....Meow what?,"Love the product, but a backorder with a date of Feb 2013 is just ridiculous. My litter box can't wait that long, which forces me to buy and use something as Petsmart and Pecto do not carry this product."
5,The Perfectly Engineered Cat Scat System,"I have two cats and two ScoopFree litter tray systems -- including a UPS battery backup for when we leave town for a few days. Every two weeks I swap out the two trays -- literally about 2 minutes work. One tip is to get a roll of cheap duct tape or masking tape and tape around the used litter tray top and bottom -- just in case the unthinkable happens (dropping the tray on the way to the dumpster)..Is is cheap? No. But now I spend about 5 minutes a month on cat scat. My wife is very picky about smell. There is NO odor. These use the ""Rolls Royce"" of crystals. A great system."
2,Litter Cartridge Problems,"I have been using Scoop Free Litter Cartridge for 6 months. I have one medium sized cat. Within two weeks of inserting a new cartridge the bottom on the box is soaked through with urine and the floor beneath the cartridge is wet. Because I need to change the cartridge every 10 days to prevent the leakage, the product is too expensive for me to continue to use.Considering the cost of the refills, a plastic box to replace the cardboard box would be a terrific improvement!"
3,Hello,"This was my first book on meditation and Buddhism. ""What is Meditation?"" is geared toward a reader like my self. It is a great book to introduce ones self to Buddhism. If you like this book, go on to bigger books which are more in depth on the subject. The book seems to touch all the bases with the tip of its toes on the Buddha's teaching and the practice of meditation. The book will teach you to accept your self and your world to make the best use of it. It offers an ideal perspective one should try to see the world through. I haven't tried any of the three meditation exercises that the book teaches, but they are all very simply instructed and easy to follow. If you want to learn about Buddhism, but don't want to commit to a very long book, this is for you."
5,A Must Have for Ducatistas,"This book captures the beauty and the power of the Ducati line. An excellent history of the manufacturer, along with a prosiac but clear description of the key models and their importance. Part Art Book, part Motorcycle Mania, part Legend, just like the Bikes."
4,Lost in Translation,"This is a very nice book picturewise but the text must be losing something in translation. I found it to be wandering, rambling and not always to the point. Giulio doesn't really follow a timeline historically and detours into cars, the philosophy of motorbicycles and social subjects. It certainly distracts."
5,Can I refer to it as sensuous?,"Looking through this book was an eye opener. The photographs, the early plans & models, the history. It's all there. It was a very real pleasure to look at all the bikes. They appear to be moving even at rest."
2,DIfficult to follow,"I found the tab in this book very hard to follow. I am a beginner guitar player, and Neil Young is always a good place to learn. However, the tab seems filled with unnecessary info that the make the bass notes hard to follow. Even simple songs that I knew like, ""The Needle and The Damage Done"", were brutal to follow. If you want an ABSOLUTE tab layout of the songs, with EVERY single minute noise, then get the book. Poor indeed, as far as I'm concerned."
5,"Useful, Light and Fun!","The Flash I Straight Edge is the best every day carry pocket knife I've ever owned. Can't say I've had that many, but compared to those I have used (Buck, Victorinox, other cheapies), the Flash I is a step above. Great for opening boxes, cutting apples, etc.Pros:Fast deployment (the assist kicks in with the thumb stud)Very light and compact, but sturdyFun to deploy (others think it's cool when you flick it open to use)Sharp blade (holds a good edge)Easy to resharpen (straight edges are easy to sharpen)Excellent grip ribbing (not too much, not too little)Torx screws can be tightened or loosened easilySafe (does not accidentally deploy in pocket)Cons:Belt clip is hard to clip on and off your pantsSafety is touchy (I Super-glued mine open)Overall, this knife is just flat out useful and fun for every day carry, and it's so light you don't even know it's in your pocket! I'm even considering getting the larger Flash II for camping. You won't be disappointed with the Flash I."
4,Great Little SOG,"I usually carry a little Buck knife for my small tasks, but this SOG Flash I has taken over these duties with perfection. This knife is great. The Flash family of knives feature SOG Assisted Technology(tm) (S.A.T.), which employs a powerful piston lock that is easily released with a sliding button.The Flash I (Straight edge) comes with glass-reinforced Zytel(tm) handle, good traction, and straight edge, Satin finished blade. All Flash knives come standard with reversible bayonet mounted clip that ensures the lowest, most discreet carry possible. We also had the foresight to incorporate an additional safety lock that gives added security when the blade is closed. Overall, this knife nut gives the SOG Flash I two thumbs up."
4,"Light, sharp, quality.","When I first received this knife, it felt like a toy. I had been carrying around an all-stainless 3-4 inch knife.After having carried this one around for a while now, I love it. It's super light and disappears in your pocket.I'm also a fan of the assisted-opening now. Not sure on the longevity of such a device, but it does increase the quickness when deploying the blade.And yeah, the knife is small. And it's not a knife for heavy duty applications. But it rocks for what it's built for; EDC."
5,EDC done right!,"As noted in other reviews, this knife is a superb EDC (every day carry) contender.With the deep carry pocket clip and featherweight 1.3 oz. you'll never feel it in your pocket but you'll always know you have capable and reliable knife on hand.Sharp enough to shave with out of the box, the Flash 1 blade is AUS 8 steel. It retains an edge well while also being easy to sharpen.Don't get me wrong, I have other knives that are better for different situations, but I never leave the house without this one in my pocket.It's just too easy to carry."
4,Nice little knife...,"This is a very nice quality small EDC knife. I say small because it is...small in feel and very light. I will probably not carry this as my EDC knife, but will carry it more when dressing up, such as business or more formal attire. It is very light in your pocket and conceals very well because of the pocket clip design. It is a little difficult to get out of your pocket because of this.It is very sharp out of the box.I find it a little difficult to open, not because of the design of the assisted opening but because the knife is so small in your hand. The lock release is also a little difficult to operate so to close the knife is a little difficult also, again due only to the small overall size of the knife.I wanted a small, easy to carry and conceal knife and that is exactly what this is. I may not consider this the best in a EDC knife, but it is an excellent knife for some occasions."
3,"Good knife, annoying design","Pros: The knife is super sharp, very light, fast opening, awesome clip hides it in your pocket.Cons,The lock level chatters and is free to move around ( very annoying), Blade has some wobble left right, up down, the clip hides the knife very well but also makes it hard to pull it out of your pocket. No fast deployments with this knife.This is by no means something you use for self defense but if you just want a small pocket knife this does a decent job its good. I got it to take when I go on a Run because it weights nothing."
3,Almost.,"I really wanted to like this knife as a cheap EDC. The deep carry pocket clip is what attracted me. Out of the box there was little blade play side to side and fore and aft. Tightening it fixed the side to side play but there is still some movement fore and aft. Also, my fingers are also too long to comfortably handle this small knife. If you have big hands stay away. I'm sending it back and getting a Spyderco Persistence for EDC."
4,Great small knife,"This is a great small knife, but I needed a larger unit. I keep this attached to my work pullover so it's close when needed for small projects. I have bought another for the bigger jobs."
2,Nice little blade...poor construction.,"I think I might have received a defective knife...the silver blade lock release on my knife wasn't stationary and rattled around. I know this is a good little knife, and a lot of people like theirs, but I think I got a bad apple."
3,sog flash 1,"not that easy to open , takes lots of practice. handle so small not much to grip to flick it open. very light in weight . nice blade."
3,I wanted to like it,"I just returned this knife to Amazon. I have owned a Flash II for several years, and have been impressed with its feel, construction, and general useability. It locks up well, doesn't rattle, and holds an edge as well as I can expect. The one hand open is smooth, easy to operate and fast.However, the baby brother of this pair is not as user friendly for me. I wanted an assisted opening smallish pocket knife, and this isn't it. It is too small in my hand for me to use the assisted open feature, and for some reason the unlocking button on the side flops back and forth at will. Not so on the II model, where it is held by spring pressure.So, maybe the knife is a great one, just not for me. Bear in mind, please, if you buy this knife it is small. Like a little Case plastic handle folder small. It disappears in my hand small.I'm going to order a Kershaw/Onion Leek, which is the next step up the size scale. I'll let you know."
2,Just not a fan,"I've been collecting blades for a bit, but do not write many reviews. I resisted getting this blade for quite a while now. But pulled the trigger. Face it - you can never have too many knives. I have more knives than my wife has shoes and purses.That said I do not find this blade to be a good value for price. Yes- others will disagree. It is a historically significant EDC knife.Pros - blade design and lightweight Great pocket clip.Cons - feels cheap like a pack of tic tacs or a pez dispenser. I hate the safety. That can be glued. The locking mechanism is loose and clicks back and forth. The click drives me crazy. The unlock is also uncomfortable and feels cheap.I have no noticeable blade play out of box.For a value knife at THIS PRICE point- I like a Kershaw skyline - volt 2 - or OSO sweet. Knives I feel do a better job at this price."
3,Filters required,This knife was purchased by mistake. I wanted the next size larger that I had previously owned but recently lost or misplaced. I am a doddering 74 yr old so apply that filter to this review. This knife has a overriding lock that is very annoying as does the next size larger. This lock seems to be deployed randomly so whenever you pull out the knife the odds are about 20% of the time the blade can't be activated because of the over ride lock. In both knives I solved this by gluing the lock permanently into the unlock position. Supposedly the clip can be taken off and made into R or L hand position. I have an extensive star bit collection and none fit the screws on this knife. The hole for a lanyard is so small as to make it useless. Some of my problems could be caused by voluminous pockets that are much used. If You are a hipster wearing slim trim clothes this could be your knife.
2,Questionable reliability,"This knife does not completely live up to the hype in my opinion. Yes it is very light. Yes the blade is good quality. But the internal mechanism is very weak and possibly unreliable. Lots of play side to side AND up and down. Side too side play can be tightened with pivot screw, but loosens again requiring fairly frequent re-tightening. Some Youtubers who are blade experts say too apply Loc-tite blah blah blah. All well-and-good for experienced knife guys, but us every-day folk just want the knife to work properly. Particularly concerning is the up & down play which can not be adjusted, and speaks to the reliability of the lock-up. I have both Flash 1 and its bigger brother the Flash 2. The Flash 2 lock-up is much better. Considering its price, it should have a better lock."
3,SOG FLASH 1,THE KNIFE IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE KERSHAW KEN ONION SPEED SAFE SERIES. THE ASSISTED OPENING IS HARDER TO WORK AND DOES NOT LOCK UP AS SOLIDLY.
1,S.O.G Flash 1,Stay away.Blade play in every direction.I tightened the pivot screw and that helped with the side to side play but there is still way too much vertical play.You can have mine if you want it.Pure junk.
2,Knive Review,I have several knives and consider myself a knive junkie. This is not one of my better buys.
4,Good Knife,"Great knife, but a little small. I have regular to large hands and I just couldn't get comfortable with it. The knife itself is great quality wise though. If you have large hands, I would go with the Flash II. All in all I am not that disappointed with it."
4,A quality knife that may or may not suit your needs,"I bought the Flash I to replace the Gerber LST that I have been carrying for probably 20 years. For me, I see no need for a pocket clip on a knife this small, I prefer to simply put it in the bottom of my pocket, so I took the clip off, but the little thumb studs poke when in my pocket. I find the SAT (Sog Assisted Technology) not needed on this knife because of it's small size. when I open it, sometimes the stud on the opposite side hits my finger when the blade swings open and I have to open the blade manually. Despite not have a thumb stud or spring, I can open my Gerber one handed quite easily and close it with one hand, but closing the Flash I takes two hands because of the position of the blade lock. I have the larger Flash II and give that one five stars, but for me, it is larger than what I want to carry everyday. Quality wise, like all SOG's it is super, but I think some of SOG's features are not needed on a knife this small."
5,My Flash 2 now has a little brother.,"I was so pleased with the Flash 2 in camo (just to be different from the normal black), I picked up the Flash 1 so it would have a little brother.It is just as well made as the Flash 2, but much smaller and lighter. Really a near perfect little utility knife. The price is probably a tad high for what you get, but you could do far worse.Watch Nutnfancy's video and you will see what you need to know to decide if this little guy is for you. Note: Nutnfancy has a number of informative knife reviews on YouTube if you want to check out other options. Just search for ""Nutnfancy"" or ""Nutnfancy Project"".I agree with others that the safety is more annoyance than a plus option. But the 1 and 2 are really utility knives vs. defense knives, so if it does happen to slip ON, it really is not a huge problem. You can still work the safety and open the knife with one hand."
2,Too Small and Awkward,"I found using the thumb stud on this knife too awkward and too difficult to use. For me, this knife is too small to have a thumb stud. I prefer the Kershaw OD2. The OD2 is similar in size, but is much easier to deploy the blade, and actually fun. A knife this small needs some sort of flipper."
4,SOG Speciality Knife,"Overall it is a decent knife, however I notice that the hinge seems a little rough when closing. Also I have very large hands and some arthritis, and due to the small grip, I have trouble opening it with one hand. I think most users would be pleased with the operation of the knife and the workmanship."
2,So small,I purchased this for work and there is no possible way I could use it for my job. Way too small!
3,Too small,SOG is a great knife company. Everything I have owned from them is top quality. This example is just too small for my needs.
2,"Sharp, but not well put together.","I quickly found that the blade lock rattles around completely loose if the knife is closed. I also immediately noticed how 'cheap' the knife felt. After a couple weeks of carrying, the pocked clip became loose in an unusual manner, because the handle began to break. The blade is sharp, I've had no issues there. But this is not the knife that was recommended to me by Nutnfancy, and I'm going to call ""counterfeit"" on the product I received..."
5,Too Much Purple / Pink Dancer!!,"This album has alot of good beat for Baby Got Back, Finally, Deeper And Deeper, Im Too Sexy, Jump Around, Real Love and the rest. I have this album when I first saw this album at the mall in 1993. I never stop loving this album! Its been 14 years and I never get tired of listening this album!!"
2,Good acting but no real story,"Unlike other reviewers, I was not impressed with this movie. I have wanted to see it since it's release as my sister say it and told me about it at that time. But somehow, I never got around to it, until now.I am a big Brad Dourif fan and I thought he did well with the material he was given. As did Beatty, Wright, etc.If you take this as a travelogue traveling thru the old south and just meeting different characters you would see then, then I guess you would enjoy this film. But if you're looking for a credible, interesting storyline, it's not here. Haven't read the book, so can't compare.Worth seeing for curiosity's sake, but don't think you'll find this too entertaining. And I hated the strange fellow following Hazel Motes around and just acting either strange or of very low intelligence. The music implied he was comic relief but I found his every appearance rather jolting and distracting."
3,Confusing,"Was this guy a schizophrenic, having delusions of grandeur, emotionally damaged, on a quest for the real God, or trying to become a god himself? I honestly have no clue. The quasi religious zeal and fanaticism he expresses throughout the film seem to have no beginning and no end, no goal and no concrete desire. With such a strange character, the audience needs to be provided with more information to understand him a little better."
4,cms,"This is a strange movie, its still kinda neat to see after so long. Has some classic lines, ventage video, and if your from Georgia you may recognize some of the people in this film. Classic Flannery O'Conner..."
5,Hard to understand but worth watching.,"I was looking for a story out of the ordinary and I found it here. The movie has John Huston's excellent direction and the acting is superb. It is a difficult movie to understand. Mr. Motes pursues his vision of religious truth with great intensity and certainty. He winds up angry, without sympathy for others, and worse (more detail w/be a spoiler). Since the book's author, Flannery O'Connor was a devout Catholic, I'm guessing part of her intent was to warn that this is not a good state of mind in which to pursue sprirtual goals. Myself, I prefer agnosticism. Don't believe too strongly in something you can't prove is right. Watch it and see what it means to you."
3,'Earth Ritual: A Journey Into Drums 'N' Bass' (Cleopatra) Various Artists,"I've often said that Cleopatra and their spin - off labels have always been fully able to assemble a good 'sampler' or what most refer to as a 'various artist' compliation. 'Earth Ritual...' isn't exactly my favorite V/A disc I have, but I do tend to pull it out now and again for a spin. Total of eleven tracks, with semi-memorable cuts from 808 State, Bill Laswell, Surface 10, System 7, Art Of Noise, Spaceship Eyes among other notable electronica / club dance artist's work. Not half-bad,I say."
4,The life seen as a chess game!,"At the late Fifties an anonymous village in Los Andes, feels altered its calm among the teacher and the butcher, who were most affectionate friends and partners of political fights. The warden profits by the facts and gets the collaboration of the police; excellent opportunity to tithe the opposition.In the eighties, Colombia had an abrupt explosion of creativity, supported by a talented crowd of filmmakers, actors and screenwriters. Get close to this unusual picture, and be surprise."
3,El director emblema del cine colombiano,"Este es uno de los primeros trabajos del director colombiano Sergio Cabrera, los actores son buenos y la pelicula bien lograda. La trama no se desarrolla en un espacio suficientemente comprensible para el espectador y parece ser una vision diferente a las peliculas posteriores del director."
2,"This was, unintentionally, a satire of War of the Worlds.","When Devlin and Emmerlich made this movie, it was their intention to make a serious movie. And they failed miserably. What they ultimately ended up doing instead was make a satire of the 1953 movie War of The Worlds. Of course this was not their intention. Their intention was to make a serious sci-fi movie.I know that there are a lot of people out there who hate this movie just as much as I do. My advice? Watch the 1953 War of the Worlds. My prediction is that the more you hate Independence Day, the more you will like War of the Worlds."
5,A breath of fresh air...,This album I can listen to straight through. One of the few this year. Check it out.
3,"Mystic is cool, but no Lauren Hill","I was expecting something really fresh and new, but I was a little disappointed to hear kind of a well-produced, but contrived record, where Mystic spoon-feeds me knowledge I already have. Better than a lot of stuff out there, but then again there's not too much good stuff out there, right?"
5,I Would Give It 10 Stars If I Could,"Well worth the wait and delivers strongly on the promise. Extremly real and heartfelt stories of her personal pain. My favorite is ""Girlfriend Sistagirl"" which I can't get enough of. I want to thank DaveyD and KPFA for the advance peep.By the way anyone who would compare Mystic to Lauren Hill,is short sighted to compare Jill Scott to Erykah Badu, or India Arie to Sade. All have their own completly unique and special message. All have obviously different life experiences that shows in their music. And all have earned the right to be heard within their own spirit. The only thing they have in common is every last one of them are greatly talented in their own right,and they have/had great albums out lately.You are missing a truely beautiful blessing, if you sleep on this. Check it out for yourself!"
5,RE: Excellent book,"I read this book in approximately the same number of day as chapters included in this amazing book. I especially enjoyed reading chaptes 6-8. My intention is to read as many of Mr. Sowell's books as possible. His writings are enhancing my understanding of not only economics; I am gaining advantageously an appreciable understanding on several socialistic topics too. I recommend this book for those interested in culture, race, history, and the causal factors, which brought about numerous conceptions ill-advisedly advancing and prompting numerous barriers, biases, and inequality world-wide. Additionally, this book awakens those of us who have been systematically acculturated or enculturated into believing or accepting conventional wisdom. I suspect, whcih similarly presented in an uncritical and indiscriminating perspective to instilled much of the rancor among cultures and races."
3,...adrift in the pond,"This book left the reader with too many loose ends. There were many mysteries in the story... and too many left unsolved. Yes, it would make for good discussions, but left the individual reader adrift and without any closure."
2,It didn't take long to put this one down,"Three chapters was all it took for me to put aside this book. There must have been 25 characters introduced within the first 40 pages, most of whom seemed insignificant to the story. Adding to the confusion was the point of view mess. I never knew from sentence to sentence whose thoughts would abruptly emerge; sometimes three in one paragraph. Where oh where are the editors today?"
1,As much as I hate to do this:,"I cannot recommend this book to anyone. After starting this book a half dozen times and putting it down, I finally forced myself to finish it. The author is ALL over the place, out on a tangent adding characters and describing stuff paragraphs long that doesn't even matter. Just at the end when you start to finally get interested, the story abruptly ends and leaves the reader hanging. NOTHING gets answered. I felt like a few pages of my book must surely have been ripped out. I am immensely repectful of authors and I admire their talent so much. Having said that, I really am sorry to say that I don't know how this book got published. It is truly the worst novel I have ever read. I bought it because I enjoyed the movie ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" so much. I had such high hopes for this book. Disappointing."
2,Meh,"I am a fan of Frances Mayes and have loved and read all of her books on Tuscany and travel several times. This book did not live up to my high expectation of Mayes' writing. The plot was slow and almost non-existent. There was nothing really driving it. Granted a body being dug up and a gravestone being vandalized is a bit of drama, but not a reason to fly home from Italy or halt everyone's life. It was slow reading and the character development was lacking, probably because there were too many characters. The relationship between Ginger and JJ wasn't realistic and even inappropriate at times. I kept waiting for everything to come together and for it all to make sense. The ending was anti-climactic to say the least. Several times I wanted to stop reading and then I got to the end and was left thinking is this all there is?"
1,too dark,this book is a downer from the get-go. so depressing. loved under the tuscan sun so tried this one. don't waste your time/
4,PLUSH BEAR ORNAMENTS,"VERY COLORFUL SOFT AND EASY TO HANG ON TREE OR USE FOR MANTLE, TABLE, CENTERPIECE OR ANY OTHER AREA THAT NEEDS THAT SPECIAL SOFT TOUCH."
5,Awesome,I was truly blessed. It was a great worship experience. I love music you can really get into. I was looking for music I could use in our worship services and it really touched the soul.
3,"Re-released as ""ELECTRONICA SCI-FI"" on the Alpha Wave label.","CD was re-released as ""ELECTRONICA SCI-FI"" on the Alpha Wave label in 1998. Mixes are very good, especially tack 9 ""Star Trek Doomsday Theme"" by Information Society."
3,Ok Mixes but not the Original Music,"The Mixs on this CD are good like track 6 Dr. Who Themeand trck 11 In search of theme. If you are looking for the original themes and music I would recommend that you look else where, but it is still a good CD."
5,CD of lp not available in north america,"Runs 46 minutes, same as lp version. The sound quality is brillant.Has a reprint of the original lp liner notes.See previous reviews for more information as I agree with them.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,WARNING: THIS IS NOT A MUSIC CD!!!,"I ordered this thinking that it was a Black Eyed Peas music CD. Even though it comes up under the Amazon Music category and even though the audio tracks are laid out like a music album, this is AN AUDIO BOOK ... there is no music here!"
4,Take it from someone who knows...,"I believe that one needs to know just a bit about the French culture in order to understand this book. Thankfully, having read Le Divorce (drivel by itself, but I learned a lot about marriage, affairs, and divorce in France by reading it), I knew enough to appreciate not just the beautiful prose and heart-wrenching story of a marriage in turmoil, but also the reasoning behind why this marriage and the beginning of its end was so different from any that would have happened in the US. Still, I picked this book up on a whim and I am glad I did so, as I believe Mr. Franck, despite the cultural differences, did the best job possible of describing what it is like to lose a spouse."
5,An incredibly touching and perceptive view of separation,Franck's writing style is unique and refreshing. His perception into the emotional devastation and fluidity is touching and painful. This is the best book I've read in years.
4,An elegant story that'll make you feel sane,"Bought on a whim, most likely because I was confused by the separation growing between my lover and myself that I had no words to explain.Hooked immediately,it's wild ride lasted stright untill dawn, I didn't even risk taking a break for a quick smoke.It has it all.From the stupid and selfish gestures to the geniune pain and fear and anxiety and he put it all into words in a way I can only dream of emulating.I'm jealous of the ease with which he let me into his soul.This book therefore earns a place in min"
4,Solid performance from a founding father of jazz,"Although his style was relatively conservative, Louis Armstrong's position as a founding father of jazz, and as a world-class performer, is indisputable. Here he is, at peak form, playing his heart out in an hour-long late-1950s European concert, backed by a band that seems to take as much pleasure blowing the old-style New Orleans trad as Satchmo himself. The music is thematically static, but each song is so joyful, you hardly mind. Armstrong throws himself wholeheartedly into each melody and every note, and his enthusiasm, though obviously the product of intense professionalism, is irresistible. This is a wonderful look at one of the greatest showmen of the 20th Century. Recommended!"
4,nice performance,"I love jazz..and to watch a louis Armstrong show was really nice. My sister owns this program, and the only problm was that it was to short. I loved all 55 minutes of it."
5,Great Historic Concert!,I am a huge Jazz fan! This a must have for any Louis Armstrong fan. Well worth the price of addmission...Coop
4,A Delightful Rarity,"There are surprisingly few video recordings of Armstrong and his All-Stars in concert. This is one of the best. While the audio and video quality are hardly pristine by today's standards, obviously great care has been invested in this restoration. The disc is an important historical record. Even more, Pops--even late '50s Pops--was never less than joyous in his music-making and showmanship."
2,Art Tatum The Complete Capital Recordings,"While there is no doubt of this gentleman's talent, he can twinkle the keys faster than anyone I have ever heard, but after the first couple of songs I long for him to SLOW DOWN. Every gem on this album is played at lightning speed, which while impressive, becomes annoying after awhile. If you want to hear someone play all the old standards at triple speed, you will love this collection. I prefer them played at the speed they were written for."
4,"Comparlson between 'Ram attack""of fighters on B-17 over Germany and and B-29 over Japan !","In this book,""Elite strumppen"" German fighter groups areheavely armed and armoured fighter groupthis special group's main purpose is attacking B-17daylight bombing group over Germany.Rarely they did volunteerd""ramming attack""(colliding attack of thier attacking airplaneto enemy object--KAMIKAZE attack)In Japan,from many reports from Japanese writers,special task forces(such as Ramming division of 244th Sentai,Japan)involved,multiple,systemic ramming attacks)collide down many high altitue,daylight flying,B-29s in tight formations(quated from ""B-29 hunters of the JAAF"",Osprey elite units thruough Amazon.)"
4,informative and well writen,I found this book provided a good over view of areial combat against Alied bombers during the last years of WWII. I had not been aware of the Sturmgruppen before seeing this title.
5,The best baby book I've found!,"I looked at so many baby books before my twins were born, and this was hands-down the most darling and complete book out there! The book follows your child's first five years, but focuses most attention on the first--footprints, first words, places for photos of all kinds, a sweet little layout for recording their growth, and adorable illustrations. I was so impressed with the quality, content, and layout of this book--enough to be thoroughly disappointed with the Anne Geddes I purchased after reading rave reviews. I also liked the padded cover and little protective cover-box it comes in. You will love this sweet little book!"
5,An absolutely GORGEOUS baby book!,This is by far the loveliest baby book I've seen. I've looked in many shops in Australia and none of the books compare to this one.It comes in a gorgeous box that will protect the book. It's got a lovely padded cover and it has all the important pages for documenting your childs first five years.I love the family tree and the illustrations throughout the book are absolutely gorgeous. There are plenty of places to add photos too.I thoroughly recommend this book to everyone.
5,The Blessing Of A Baby Book,"This book is very sweet! Its got a yellow 2"" boarder around the book which is cool because it could be for a girl or boy and comes in a safe keeping box to protect it. I have already been flipping through it and reading and will be starting to write in it. It has about two-three places where you can take a small size envelope and either glue or tape onto the book yourself for keeping precious locks of hair, first tooth, and other things. There are places to place a few photos through out the book but I am planning on using double sided tape in case they ever need to come out quickly without harming the book and photo. I can't wait to get started on this book! I am a christian lady and love the fact that it is christian based with scriptures through out, even my husband who is not into all the scrap booking and stuff was impressed. I hope this helps you."
4,gorgeous!,"this is a beautiful way to record your baby's first 5 years. i have also embellished it with some scrapbooking items, just for that extra. but there's plenty of room for photos, special memories, keepsakes. I love the Christian-based aspect of this product, and the gorgeous box it comes in."
4,"Love the BT part, not so the key board","The BT adapter opens up options for me. Just love it. the mouse runs dry pretty quick but works very well and precise. the key board, i hate. it glitches alot-it would disconnect and can't reconnect(there's 3 tricks to reconnect it, and 1 of them always works.) the low battery warning would come on randomly. the set point program suck. works about 75% of the time. it's been l;ike 2 year in and it's still working, so that's really good."
4,Good Product,"The product that shipped wasn't the product viewed in the picture; although, the product name is the same. This bothered me at first because it was for my dad and he needs exactly what he needs. He ended up being happy with the product which was good but for some reason one of the pieces, the separate calculator on the right side of the keyboard-yes it is separte from the acutal keyboard, will not connect/link up to the PC."
1,Logitech's low-blow,Before you buy this delicious looking combo read reviews. Problems with keyboard connection and making connection if you are succesful will take between 30 to 60 min(!!) of your time on regular basis. Tried to set up USB bus so it is not disconnected by Windows (to save energy) helped nothing in resolving the connection issue. Tried probably everything. Nothing works to fix connectivity issue. Unless you uninstall ane reinstall software every single day. Simply stay away. Don't even bother.
1,Sticks All the Time,"I received this keyboard / mouse combo from Logitech as a replacement for a different defective model of Logitech combo that I had purchased. Not impressed with either of them. The other combo crashed completely after a couple of months. This one - the keyboard keys stick, and a single strike will enter continuously quite often. And, the first key strike in an entry will double almost every time. No amount of playing with the settings corrects this. And, the battery indicator shows that the batteries are low almost constantly - when they are not. I would recommend a different manufacturer....This set has been a constant irritation. I am looking for a better product. I will not be purchasing a Logitech."
1,Useless.,"Ive had two of these now. Returned the first one because the keyboard just completly died one day and wouldnt turn back on. Both of them have had connection problems where the keyboard would randomly disconnect and require special attention to reconnect. The keyboard if left alone for a few seconds will spaz out and the key you push will be pushed 10-15 times. Even if you only pushed it once. The mouse is fine, I love the mouse, but the keyboard is completely useless and chews through batterys."
4,Good Features but left me wanting more,Great quality interface that has an LCD display! I wish the menu options included more features. Only limited to Media Player and startup features for basic functions. But it is really a nice product.
4,Great product,i have nothing but good things to say about this keyboard/mouse combo. It is everything it says it is and does everything it says it does. The only issue may be when the kayboard is 1st turned on its got about a 1 or 2 sec lag and then after that its good to go.
2,Fussy peripheral,"The first set I got had a bad keyboard and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong. I finally got a technician who worked with me and figured out that the keyboard was bad. I will say that the technical people were really good and very knowledgeble. Good thing too because these are really fussy gadgets. The second one worked right out of the box and is great but I have too many things that interfere with the signal apparently because after a couple weeks I lost connectivity and also lost interest in troubleshooting. I'm in the middle of a lot of big, time sensitive projects and I don't have the time to work out what the problem is this time. So I recommend this set to gadget loving, problem solving types but not to those who have a low level of frustration."
2,Save your money,"I've had the Logitech MX5000 combo kit for over a year. When I first purchased it I was so pleased that I bought a second for my other computer. However they have a long way to go to perfect this pair. Every month or so it disconnects the bluetooth pairing and you have to go through the re-connect excercise. An annoyance, but I liked the extra functions. Now I'm having issues where I either lose the keyboard or mouse and have to re-install the entire software package to get it to function again. If it were just on one set, I could chalk it up to a single defect. However, it happens on both with increasing frequency. It's gotten to the point where I'm now looking for a wired pair to avoid this frustration. Save yourself the aggrevation and keep looking for something more reliable."
4,"Don't use the disk, download the latest software from logitech","Had all the connectivity issues everyone else had until i uninstalled everything are reinstalled using the latest setpoint software from logitechSetPoint 3.30 Bluetooth running Windows WP. Works great now, no disconnects, can connect my phone, bluetooth headset, no problems."
1,Bad Software,"This product is wonderful in theory, but it does not work at all in practice. Constant crashes (even after downloading the update) make your computer slow and unusable. A keyboard and mouse with lots of functionality is pointless if all of your programs crash. As of July 2006, Logitech hasn't updated the software since April despite knowing of its serious stability problems. Due to their complete lack of concern for their customers, I recommend that you do not purchase this product."
1,Impossable to Install on Windows XP pro,The software included with the product is incorrect and the Logitech support was less than helpful. After installing the updated software I still can not boot my desktop as I am receiving a keyboard error 0211 if I do not have another keyboard installed. The support suggestion was to find another computer and try it there. I am sure we all have many other computers. The package is now being packed for return.I Logitech wants to continue marketing products they must improve both the quality and the support. As for myself there will not be any Logitech products in my cart.
2,could have been good,looks like a great product and all just 1 problem... it doesnt friggin work. always disconnects and the mouse is always crappy.. save a few bucks and get a better product.. i recommend the mx3100
1,Keyboard Lag,"This is a wonderful product with the exception of a very annoying and lengthy lag in keyboard strokes. As I write this, If I were to stop typing for more than a second or two, it would take five to ten seconds of typing or twenty to thirty key entries for my keystrokes to start to be recognized. Reinstalling the drivers and software has no effect. Thus far Logitech has not addressed this issue. Contemplate the effect this would have on word processing."
1,Logitech MX 5000 and Laser Mouse,"NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!Have had excellent experience with Logitech in the past however, with this setup the keyboard has difficulty being recognized by the poorly written software program (Setpoint). Version 3.xx was shipped with the keyboard and when I upgraded to the latest version of Setpoint from the Logitech site, the mouse and keyboard could not be detected. Uninstall new version and reinstall old. Mouse and keyboard recognized. Reboot, only mouse recognized. Attempts to connect in vain. Uninstall and reinstall Setpoint(old version)keyboard and mouse recognized. Either the hardware is a problem or the software not well written. Only have had to reinstall software twice in the last two weeks. Think I am going back to the mouse & keyboard combo had since Win98. P.S. Mouse works flawlessly, would recommend as stand alone.6/8/08 UpdateGive up on this device. Listing on Craigslist."
5,Logitech Cordless Desktop MX 5000 Laser,Easy to install. No issues on install or after. Works nicely and helps make the work area look cleaner because of less wires.
4,Nice buy - i recomend,"works prety finelooks very nice, stylishgood rangevery good batery lifenot so good: the touch sensitive doens`t work well.."
4,Surprised- It works!,"When I was reading the reviews for this, I was horrified. People said it lagged, the range sucked, it doesnt work at all, the media controls are too sensitive. Well for me, that is not the case. In fact, I am using the keyboard to type this review from my bed, at least 10 feet away. And the model I got was refurbished to boot.The only thing keeping this product from a perfect 5 stars is that the forward and back controls on the mouse do not work with non-windows programs, like firefox and the lcd should have a backlight. With the staggering customization options already there, they could have done a little more like let you edit certain other keys. I have not tried to pair the computer with another bluetooth device yet but no connectivity problems, and the mouse was 2/3 charged out of the box. In conclusion, this is a great product and I completely reccomend it to anyone that can afford it."
2,Severe Connection Issues,"This hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse. When it's connected and working, it does its job very well. Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively. At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package. The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own, but stay away from this Bluetooth combo. It is unstable and very frustrating to use."
3,"Great initial experience, weak durability","I am using two of the logitech sets, and I'm extremely please with mouse and keyboard comfort. After installing the newest software I have not experienced any software related issues. Keyboard battery life is decent (using 2200mAh rechargeables), mouse with the charger isn't an issue neither.Unfortunately after approximately year of use the material used to protect mouse surface started to peel of. Shortly after I've noticed it on the mouse I use at work (approx 8hr day) same symptoms appeared on my mouse I use at home (4hr day). It doesnt affect the functional aspect of the mouse, however it highly decreases comfort of use. I'm contacting logitech trying to get a replacement."
2,Horrible,I have only owned Logitech keyboards and mice. I purchased a new computer in November so I bought this new keyboard/mice combo and gave my old one to my sister. BIG MISTAKE!!! Always problems with keyboard not connecting and now the mouse stop working. I am ordering the MX3000 this is my favorite. Logitech doesn't even sell this mess anymore.
3,"Best Bluetooth mouse, mediocre keyboard","This is the best bluetooth mouse that Logitech makes. It works best on the Mac with easy setup and precise tracking. On windows, the bluetooth connection can lag, causing tracking errors. The keyboard has encryption that prevents normal use on the Mac, no drivers are available. On windows, the keyboard is so-so and most of the extra buttons (for email, search, or whatever) are very unresponsive. I highly recommend the mouse for anyone with a bluetooth enabled laptop, but the $100+ price tag for a good mouse alone is a bit steep."
3,Okay Product...,"I've been using this keyboard and mouse combo for over a year now. When I first bought this keyboard & mouse combo, the USB adapter was defective so I couldn't connect the keyboard or the mouse. Found this out when I had the logitech support representative trying to help me install it.Cons:1. I have all the latest and greatest updates downloaded for the set, but I still have those times when I push down on a key while I'm chatting or surfing the web where the bluetooth usb receiver thinks I'm holding down the key for a long period of time and it won't stop until 1-2 mins pass.2. I believe the program that comes with the keyboard & mouse, Desktop Messenger, takes up alot of memory on my computer.Pros:Other than the minor gliches, it's a pretty good keyboard & mouse set. I love being able to connect my other bluetooth devices via the bluetooth usb receiver."
2,The keyboard loses connection often...,"and to reconnect, it's not just pressing ""connect"" due to the security of bluetooth. Very annoying."
2,No User Manual,"The keyboard and mouse setup okay with VISTA. It works with my PC and software but I have no idea how the setup for the special keys work. Logitech did not send a manual with the product nor was there one on the CD that came with it. So, I seached Logitech's web page and there is no manual there for download either.I find this completely unacceptable for a hardware company to sell their products without any instructions for the user. I put this out there for you to consider when you are considering buying this item."
1,Logitech's first piece of CRAP that I have owned.,"So, I purchased this off amazon.com about three months ago, because my beautiful and amazing Logitech MX3000 keyboard mouse set got a cup of orange juice spilled on it. THANKS HONEY! Anyway, I thought, ""well, the MX5000 is higher in number so it must be better."" WWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MX5000 IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF DUNG I HAVE EVER BOUGHT IN MY LIFE! As I mentioned I gave it three months, but I wish to God I had just gone with a new MX3000 keyboard...WHICH I JUST PURCHASED!!!!Anyway, if you do not want to waste your money, and want to avoid frustrations that could cause extreme headaches, or broken knuckles from punching the wall....DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!"
2,setup,"""Easy & quick setup"" my butt.The instructions suck. There barely are any to start with and what there is are apparently incorrect. No decent documentation or support.I finally got it set up after over 3 hours straight. We'll see if it was worth it now."
3,MX 5000 Bluetooth Wirless Keyboard,"I have a couple of problems with sensitivity of the mouse during game play as well as while using the short-cut keys. Sometimes they take a little longer than desirable to open their assigned perpose. But other than that, I love it. The zoom feature is perfect since my monitor is wall mounted and, thus, a little farther away. I also like the fact that the media keys (play, pause, etc.) don't have to pull up the iTunes tab to use them. iTunes can remain minimized whle you use them."
1,Extremely Unstable!!,"Its Bluetooth connection loses very often, once every half hour or so. And when the connection is lost, there's no way to reconnect except for waiting for it to recover itself in a minute or two. (As I'm typing this review, I lost my keyboard connection once...)"
1,terrible,"the MX1000 mouse is solid. that is the only positive about this product. the keyboard lags considerably. sometimes, like right now, I'm typing about two words ahead. It randomly disconnects, at the most inconvenient times. the software is annoying and complicated. it alt+tabs by itself about every half an hour... also, very annoying. i hate this desktop. it is way too expensive, and it just plain doesn't work. bluetooth technology sucks. stick with wires until the technology gets better."
1,JUNK,"I bought this piece of junk today and will be returning it tomorrow.I've used logitech mouses and keyboards and found them good products but this MX5000 is at best apiece of junk. Blue tooth sorta, kinda recognizes the key board and then it doesn't at all. The delay in the key board, the locking up of the mouse is intolerable.While Logitech does make good stuff, this thing is crap. Don't buy it and waste your time and money. Logitech MX 5000 is a bad piece of hardware. To call it junk is being kind. Useless is the best I can say about it."
5,Best Choice,"I shopped at many different stores knowing what I had in mind. This was by far the best set I could find.The only real con to this system is the LCD screen on the keyboard has no form of backlighting. I would also like to see a recharagable system for the keyboard. The wireless works flawlessly and the mouse responds to minute movements over every surface I have available. It does not come with an abundance of setup instructions. It is however, remarkable easy to use afterwards."
1,Next to useless Cordless Keyboard/Mouse,"Total pain to get bluetooth recognized. Keybrd/mouse IMMPOSIBLE to connect sometimes, still need to leave corded mouse/keygrd connected to enable the Logitech combo. Tech support is a JOKE because the reply form won't allow you to enter your phone # because of a bug in the software. I'll use it til I get sick of it then I'll throw it out, its not even wasting my time to return"
2,MX5000 Bluetooth Desktop is disappointing....,"First MX5000 Desktop never would connect. Installation instructions were overly simplistic and incomplete for today's environment of firewalls and realtime ad-ware detection software. Replacement shipment arrived promptly. Installation occurred without incident and both the mouse and keyboard connected without incident. The MX1000 laser mouse is terrific, but the keyboard has some issues. After the keyboard is idle for a period, it's like it has to ""wake-up"" when you begin typing. Not only is the display of the first key entered delayed, but most of the time this first keystroke is duplicated - enter 'A' as the first keystroke and frequently 'AA' is the input displayed. Hopefully, Logitech will issue a patch for this issue."
2,Some Promise but too flakey,"I have been waiting for a bluetooth Logitech combo to use with my laptop/docking station. I currently use a wired keyboard and MX3100 cordless mouse. The 3100 loses its connection on occasion and therefore I was hopeful for a less flakey replacement. The MX5000 does not work with my laptop Windows 2000, which I ultimately found on the box. So, I used it on my home XP system. It performed o.k., for a while. Within a couple of hours, it lost connection and was only recoverable by removing and replacing the USB dongle (transceiver) that came with it. This is unacceptable to me, so I am returning it. I am using the Microsoft bluetooth keyboard without the same problem, but would rather use a Logitech."
1,"""Unknown Product""","This product is on back order,it's approaching a month since the order was placed with Office Depot(Computer4sure.com).I'm thinking about cancelling it."
2,Alright Keyboard,"The keyboard works great, but you have to have the bluetooth adapter in front of the PC or you dont get a good enough signal and the Mouse lags. also have problems the the mouse doesnt recognize until after logged into Windows XP."
4,Ho-ho,"Ho-ho. I have changed my mind about this ghastly translation (it's the only one), Just imagine! I'm not telling you how to live. You will be all white at the back when you finish. Oho!"
5,An essential source for understanding Russian culture,"I've read the novel together with its sequel, The Golden Calf, in Russian about a dozen times. Now I simply have to get an English copy to share it with my non-Russian speaking friends! It is true: the speech of an average Russian contains quite a few quotations from the novel (also due to a number of film versions). Twelve Chairs is something definitely worth having in your home library: you can open it at any time and start reading on any page. In minutes, you're guaranteed, if not to laugh, then to smile."
4,A good read,"This was a well written and detailed autobiography of a young Austrian's experience in the German Army as an infantry officer on the Eastern Front. He covers his officer training in 1941/42 when the army was still interested in turning out gentlemen as well as competent leaders of men. Armin saw his first action in Russia in 1942 and his last as a badly wounded hospital patient in Danzig in 1945 where he began two years of Soviet captivity.This book deserved 5-stars, but the publisher did not include any maps! How a reader is suppost to follow a military campaign of movement without maps is beyond me and is the only real flaw of this book. Be warned that the print is small (paperback size), and some photos would have been nice too(there were none). Despite its flaws, it is still a good read."
4,Fascinating,"Readers will not want to put this down, once they get into the horrible realities of the war on the Eastern Front in World War 2. They will experience the shocks and fear of soldiers who in time recognize that there will be no great victory this time for the fatherland. The German troops are as professional as they can be made to be, but they encounter greater numbers and greater persistence than they had ever imagined. It is interesting to witness this realization spread among the troops."
4,Very interesting story of the many battles on the eastern Front,"As a long time student of the German/Russia war, I found the book an interesting addition to the many others i have read. I would have given it 5 stars but for the lack of discussion about the treatment of Jews and Russian prisoners."
3,Good read,This book was very interesting coming from a solder that was on the front. I would say this book is worth the time to read
3,Interesting perspective of WWII from a German soldier's view,"Although this biography was not intended to be published, the translation is easy to read and provides a good portrayal of what the war and its aftermath were like for non-Nazi German soldiers."
3,Memoirs of an Austrian soldier,"The book is just another record of a survivor from the eastern front. What is noteworthy is the constant surprise at the treatment of the German soldier by his enemies, the Russians. It is hardly credible that he ignored the treatment of Russian prisoners throughout the campaign as well as the abuse and terror heaped on the civilians of occupied territories. This is a common factor in German memoirs."
3,Aventures in my Youth,"A basic no frills account of from somebody who sounds like he sould have become a priest not a soldier, however he must have believed in what he was fighting for, to become an Officer at such a young age. The incluion of some photo's would shed a bit of light on some of his comments, but never the less interesting reading."
3,"Interesting, but there is much left unsaid","Not every soldier has to bear the guilt of Nazi atrocities, but given that this is a reflection by a young Christian on his experiences on the Eastern Front, why is the J word, Jews, missing? There's a mention in passing of the Nuremberg trials and the need for his Aryan certificate, but nothing else. It's an interesting story, but given that it was written many years after the event and with plenty of time for reflection, recycling the 'good German, depraved Russian' line and completely ignoring the holocaust is unconvincing."
2,Not so good as i thought,"First of all this book seem to be far from detailed.Writer is not going deeper into his own feelings and while reading you can smell that book is not complete. Author could have give us so much more but the hole story is very thin.If you are looking for action details you wont find it here,no,i am really not happy with this book."
2,Not Our Favorite Plan Toy,"We love the size of these little vehicles, but the star in the set, the crane, doesn't work very well. It seems poorly designed in that the crane doesn't reach down far enough to actually hook on to any other vehicles or anything at ground level. The pulley mechanism works, but doesn't have a very long cable/string to move so it really doesn't do much. This is a big source of ongoing frustration for my almost 3 year old.The other two vehicles in the set or fine, but he doesn't play with them very much.I recommend the other Plan Toys construction set, with the very cool excavator, over this one. The excavator is worth more than the price of the entire set, in our opinion. You can skip this one. Or perhaps you can figure out how to modify the crane with a longer string?"
2,fun and cute but too easy to break,"My little boy loved these - until the bands (the treads) came off 1 week after he received them and then they were put into the general toy pile and not looked at again. The bands that go around the ""wheels"" fall off way too easily. We only use these indoors, yet lost one within days. They should come with a couple of replacement bands."
2,Love Plan Toys but very disappointed,"Let me start off by stating that we love Plan Toys. Our children own several items from the company. With that said, I can not recommend this product.My son received it for his birthday. Within one hour of opening it, the bulldozer broke. Within two hours of playing with the remaining pieces, the crane broke.Perhaps we received a faulty model? I am sending back for a refund."
5,A beautiful story of love in the ruins.,"This is a beautifully written book. It's tone is often hypnotic, especially in the many passsages where the lovers are each learning about themselves through their actions in the affair. Each seems to recognize that he/she is coming to life and becoming themselves through their relationship. I loved the scene in the hospital cafeteria when she wants to be as intimate as with a stranger: he tells her to pretend that they are traveling on the Trans-Siberian Express. She begins to bare her soul and all the while, behind her, a stranger whom the police are looking for listens and menaces them with a knife. The mixture of menace in everyday contemporay life and redemption through love spoke to me as few novels have."
2,Unpleasant,"It isn't literature, it isn't popular fiction, it's...a mess. The characters are difficult to care about, yet the ideas aren't strong enough to stand are their own. Painful to finish."
1,Don't waste your money,"The author does not grab you as you think he will from the story line in the jacket cover. I stopped reading at page 61. The author kept jumping around from one person to another, it was hard to follow what he was talking about or what was going on. He left to many open ended story lines. I love to read, so much that I sometimes buy the same book twice by accident. This authors name I will not forget. . . I never want to buy him again."
4,great naptime music,I work at a daycare where my classroom naps from around 12pm to 3pm. This cd is soothing to listen to. Lovely throughout!
5,This is for everyone....not just the little ones,"I bought this for my two small daughters and found I loved it so much that I play it much more often than just for naptime! Mr. Cobo's skill with the guitar is amazing and pieces he chose aren't the ""normal"" lullabys....and thank goodness they aren't! They are unique, playful, sensitive, soothing and a delight to listen to.The packaging is also so well done that when I give it as a gift (both to my friends that are expecting children and those that aren't!), it makes it feel like much more that ""just"" a CD.Whether you have kids or not, this is wonderful CD and I highly recommend it to everyone!"
5,great product,These was a great purchase. Very affordable and long lasting. The only brand I buy because of the quality and their durability
4,Good thick rubber on the boots,"The boots had a nice thick quality construction ,that would hold up for real work like concrete pouring. They stretch well over work boots with out tearing. I would get a larger size than usual it makes it a little easier to pull on and off."
3,The perspective of a church musician...,"Speaking from the perspective of a church musician with almost 1200 hundred weddings in a 30-year career...This is a comprehensive guide for couples planning a wedding at a country club, on a beach, or in a hotel ballroom but is worthless for those (the vast majority of couples in North America) planning a wedding ceremony at their respective house of worship (church, temple, or mosque, etc.). The book is inexpensive, and expansive, but seems to come from a ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" perspective.I found that most of the resources and providers named are distinctly east and west coast-centric, with a real inclination to Hollywood and New York City. For the money, it is great for a few hours of ""fantasy wedding"" reading while waiting for your unmentionables to finish drying down at the Laundromat or in your college dorm (the real world for most couples) and may provide some ideas for integrating into your non-""lifetsyles of the rich and famous"" wedding."
2,just too sappy,"The book that came with the CD has some good tips for getting ideas for your wedding music. The CD on the other hand is awful. The music is overproduced and exceptionally sappy. Some of it made me cringe. Weddings are romantic, but there is such better music available than this collection. We got rave comments on our wedding music because we hand picked it from music in our and the DJ's collection. We also had wonderful friends who compiled CDs for us with old standards and classics. It was great because it was personal and not prepackaged by somebody else. Take the time to think about your music and what moves you. Having your favorite music around you on that day will make it even more memorable-for you and everyone there!"
4,"All to know about skin, nails, hair.","The second edition of Amy L. Sutton's DERMATOLOGICAL DISORDERS SOURCEBOOK is filled with basic consumer guidelines and health facts for all kinds of conditions affecting not just skin but nails and hair. From birthmarks and skin injuries to hair loss and disorders, chapters provide all the basics on how to maintain healthy skin and hair and how to handle symptoms and aging effects."
3,Great guitar marred by remaster,"As a trio recording with just bass and drums, this album gives Green the space to stretch out and do more lead guitar work than he does on many of his albums with larger ensembles. Unfortunately a few of the songs on this CD were destroyed during careless remastering in 1980 which ruined the master tapes and resulted in a sound similar to an AM radio dialed in-between frequencies. This is tragic and the damage to the affected songs is far worse than the slight ""phasing effect"" described on the back cover. It would be nice if some kind of electronic wizardry can be used to restore these tapes to their original sound someday."
3,Not bad.,"This album is truly a classic, with SOME good tracks like Fantastic Voyage, Smokin Stix. However, I found a lot of ""filler"" tracks on the album and probably would not buy it for any more than 4 dollars. When it's in my CD player, I find myself skipping several tracks in the album."
3,Know what you're getting,"I ordered this for my 3 1/2-year-old granddaughter for a long car trip. I didn't realize that all you get for $24 is the case itself. Based on the photo of the item and the photo of the box, I thought it came with crayons, etc. Nope---just the case. My daughter was delighted, however, as she says they have all the stuff to put in it. I just think it's too much money for an empty case when there are other products I could have purchased that, for the same price or less, came with toys or art supplies."
2,Expect more..,"I expected receive the product with little pencils and coloringNot to much, but whem I sowght I expected and it's only the bagBeatiful bag..."
4,Great car item,I got this for my daughter to keep her busy in the car. The only thing that she complains about is that her color book doesn't lay flat. If it was a tad bit wider that would benefit her so the color book would actually fit. I got her some smaller books and those work great in place of the standard size books.
2,Car Valet,As another poster mentioned I mistakenly did not realize that this product does not come with any of the pictured coloring items. $25.00 is far to expensive for what is basically a little case.
2,This want the best purchase,"It is much larger than I expected, which isn't bad but our car has very little leg room where my son sits in his Britax and I have a feeling that it isn't even going to fold all the way down without hitting him. I also thought that it was going to include all of the products on the photos, because nowhere did it say that it did (or didn't) include any items, but it did say that small parts are included, so it is not for children under 3. So, I assumed it came with small products, but I was saddened that it didn't. I don't see a lot of value in this product, but if it doesn't fit in my back seat, I will probably end up returning it."
5,Very usefull for car travel to intertain the kid,"This car valet was very usefull during our long travel, the way it is built is pratical and easy for a kid to play with it. the fix table was very usefull. using kid playtoy like number color magnet image was easy to do, also some coloring."
3,"Awkward, somewhat useable","I bought this for my 4 year old for a long car ride. I installed it the night before we left, put my daughter in the car the next morning and it was clear it needed some adjusting. It never really fit right for her though, I guess my seats are too short because the thing would never get high enough for it to sit at lap level. So it hung low and angled up to her. Not ideal at all. She also could not reach any of the pouches to get things out so we were constantly having to do it for her. If you have a smaller car then beware, it probably wont fit properly."
4,Car Valet,"I liked the idea of this tray for my 2-year old daughter for long car trips. It is soft, so it can't injure her in an accident, but the tray is durable. The problem might be my specific car design. When it hangs off the back of the front seat, it seats too low and my daughter kept hitting it with her legs. My husband tried to adjust it, but with no success."
2,It's Empty.,"I had high hopes for this, but it was empty! The bag/table is mice and sturdy enough, but I would have given it a 4 if it came stocked with all the cool stuff shown in the picture."
3,Size issues with Crossover,"A protective pouch is good if it fits and protects. This one probably protects okay but there is a fit issue with the Magellan Crossover GPS. The Crossover comes with a green rubber edge protector that fits around the unit like a frame. It doesn't cover the screen or the back but it at least provides some buffer against falls or bumps. Well, this pouch does not fit the Crossover properly unless you take this edge protector off. Not a huge deal, but on a backpacking trip I don't want to leave my GPS unprotected, so rather than constantly switching back and forth between the edge protector and the pouch, I just awkwardly crammed the GPS with it's edge protector into the pouch. It works. Sort of. But the pouch now won't close quite properly. You wonder if it would have killed these people to make the pouch 1/32nd of an inch bigger so it would fit."
4,very sturdy,great holder for the roadmate. my only wish is that it had a small section cut out so you could charge it while it was in the case.
4,perfect fit,"This is the cover made for the device so you get a perfect fit. there is a magnetic flap, it holds well, maybe they could have had a better way to hold it shut. it protects the device well."
4,Pouch is good and fits my Magellan 3100,"The pouch is as advertised, fits my 3100, and seems sturdy enough to last for years."
2,Interesting but not recomended,"It's a mag closure pouch & the first time I used it I had to completely factory reset my Crossover GPS. That was also the last time I used it. It isn't water sealed, there are 2 openings at the top as if it was letting out the antenna or something. Just my 2 cents - Otherwise it seems useful as a belt pouch for something but not my GPS.l"
3,Ballistic Nylon Protective Case,"Great case for the money. Swivel belt clip is a bit awkward - wish they offered the option to remove it. Aside from that, no complaints."
5,great quality.............,"great quality belt.......we've bought the ""other"" cheaper brands & they never lasted, will stick with Gates belts, also saved over $10.00 buying it on Amazon!!!"
5,Should be required reading in every school,"The industrial miracle in Japan is a prime example of what can happen when a nation commits itself to quality and long-range vision instead of the latest illness: ""Turning a Fast Buck-itis."" Economically, Japan may be in hot water, but in less then 50 years, Japan went from making rubber dog-shit, to turning out some of the highest quality precision work in the world. When Dr. Deming first began speaking in America, America was still riding along on the post-war victory wave. No one would listen to him. The Japanese welcomed him, and even today, traces of his quality-control methods are still seen in the industrial workplace. I believe that proper application of Dr. Deming's priciples could put America back on top and keep it there"
4,The Deming management Method,"This book was an interesting read and gave many good examples and testimonies from companies applying Deming's 14 points. I think this should be required reading for CEOs and below in the management positions. If the reader is interested in quality, process improvements, and lean methods you would enjoy this book."
5,A Great Book about W E. Deming and his work,"Mary Waton does the impossible. She tells you about the life of the great Business Guru the late W.Edward Deming. The first part of the book is a short biography of the great man. Then she goes into his 14 points in detail. Another chapter is on Deming's ways to get improvement in any business.And the following chapter shows the many companies that the Deming method and philosopy help in TQM.I would recommed these method for any business, small or large.You can tell the companies that use these methods ....there services and products shine with quality and more"
2,Unit not working on third batch,"Happy with first two batches, the unit worked better than expected. On the third it stopped heating and after just 60 days I have to send in for warranty at my expense! This after having to toss 25$ worth of beef. I will check back in to advise on the experience."
3,must rotate trays,This machine works reasonably well but if you have more than 4 trays you must rotate them so the trays on the bottom dry at the same rate as the top ones. The best feature about this machine is that it has the dryer on top instead of the bottom so clean up is a lot easier. If I were to do it over again I think I would order a machine with the dryer mechanism in the back of the dryer for more even air flow.
4,Worked just fine,"So far I just dried apples and pears. The unit worked just fine and I like the controls. Nonstick tray liners supplied work great.Setting the temperature and time of drying was simple and highly variable depending on what you want to dry.The manual could be a bit more extensive for the FD-1020. I plan to make jerky and the dryer should be fine for that as well, but I'll probably use real marinated beef rather than ground meat shot from a gun. I was able to use trays from an older dryer whose heat unit had worn out. I recommend this dryer in spite of the rather high price."
2,poor quality,"After 2 years of light use, the motor burned out drying herbs at 90 degrees. It might be a good price, but replacing it every two years makes for very expensive fruit leather."
1,"Overheated, nearly caught on fire!","I purchased the dehydrator 12 months ago. Used it about 10 times, mostly for drying peppers and herbs. Then I tried to dry some thyme at 90 degrees. I checked it after 30 minutes: the unit was hot to the touch & the top trays had melted! We moved the dehydrator outside and tried again. Worked fine for about an hour, than melted and warped the remaining trays. Took it to the dump last week. Meanwhile, we still use our Mr. Coffee dehydrator purchased almost 20 years ago. No fancy temperature controls, but it consistently works great.After our experience & seeing a couple of other reviews, I would advise anyone with this product to use it with care! It was hot enough to cause a fire. Very disappointing!"
5,great for beginners,"This machine doesn't make much noise and is so easy to use.It is a pain to clean and takes a long time to finish but I set it up and leave for work, by the time I get home it's done!"
5,drying your meat :-),"this machine is excellent, it does the job in 5 hours verses other ways that have taken 7 plus hours with nowhere near the same results....this is the machine you're looking for."
4,just some comments,"This dehydrator is very easy to use and do. With the timer, you can sleep worry-free. It shuts the power off, but the digital light is still on for you to check or turne off. It dries food evenly. I like it as it really is a good machine. But when the fan is on, it's still very noisy. You need to leave it at a corner away from you.Oh, and in the package itself contains enough parts for you to work with. The addtional layers and filters, whatsoever is not worthy buying."
3,great idea...at the time...,"I was a bit dissappointed with the whole 'drying' experience- I tried to dry peaches as directed, watermelon as directed, banana's as directed- I tried and I tried but no matter how I sliced and diced they never seemed to work out for me! The fruits never dried througouhly- and I tried many different time settings- could be user error- or just mis-guidance in the directions. For me, it didn't work out- for others it may be the perfect product."
4,Not Bad,"I've tried only 2 different types of dehydrator so far and this one has been the best so far. My first one did not have a fan, did not have anything digital and didn't come with such a comprehensive recipe book. After attempting to make a lot of different things in it I can see why people go with the excalabur in the end. Ever try making crackers? it""s more difficult to make squares in a circular device. I want to be able to make crackers that are cracker shaped. IE. square all around. Nit picky am I? Maybe, but it's the small things and this is not a cheap kitchen appliance. I want a fruit rollup that I can cut into neat strips and actually roll up. It says that you don't have to rotate the trays, but in actuality if you don't the top one does dry faster. It does dry fast enough to make dried Canteloupe which is awesome! If you haven't tried that you should, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I'm going to end up switching to an excalabur, but this is a really good product."
5,good purchase!,"This product is great for dehydrating fruit, tomatoes, etc. It is easier than canning although I do that too.Heretic"
2,Banging noise at start up,"For about the first min. of operation upon each start up the unit makes a loud noise as if a fan in there somewhere is hitting something. After about the first min., the noise goes away & the unit functions however since it arrived in this condition I am wondering what else will go wrong with it & how fast.I love this dehydrator ... when I can get a hold of one that works right."
4,<FIRE IT UP>,"Rasta Red Eye Mellow Groove Smooth Tasting Dope! Excellent title, art and concept! Gotta get cool with this one, it will put a smile on your face and some IRIE in your life...Some of my favorites are: ""Under Mi Sleng Teng Remix"" by Wayne Smith with the crew from Cypress Hill, ""Jamaican Weed"" by Lone Ranger, ""One Draw"" by Rita Marley, ""The Herb"" by Tony Rebel, ""Under Mi Sensi"" by Barrinton Levy, and ""Herbsman Hustling"" by Sugar Minott.U Know What Time It Is! Cool Runnings..."
5,Great Gift!!!,"Once I turned on Badge of Honor I couldn't turn it off! A great giftforanyone, police officer or not."
3,Review of the Orphans Series,"As a big fan of VC Andrews, I always enjoy her books. The orphan series, as well as the recent books written under the VC Andrews name does not have the twisted plot as the first books actually written by VC Andrews. Orphans was an interesting series giving people a glimpse into the lives of 4 girls and the problems associated with the lifestyle their parents chose to lead. The series was differently written in that the girls are telling their stories to each other in the safe haven of their therapists office."
3,to correct ms. elizabeth,"I think you may have been mistaking the Orphans series with the Wildflowers series. In the Orphans series, no one shares their stories with each other through a therapist."
5,"Teachers, help your students succeed in elementary school","""Preventing Failure in the Primry Grades"" details a catch up program for the child who is seriously behind in basic arithmetic and reading skills. It is aimed at teachers more than parents but parents will find the information on teaching techniques very helpful too. There are chapters on mangaging your classroom, teaching (and remediating) reading, developing language skills, and teaching arithmetic. Another excellent book by Englemann."
5,What every teacher should read and keep on hand.,"As a special education teacher, this book is perhaps the best I have ever read that explains teaching children concepts involved in reading and math. The language section is excellent and is a must read."
5,sweet and gorgeous,the kind of album you will love if you like jazzy hip hop with good lyrics and slow beats which makes you feel like hearing it more than one time !there are few songs but they're all excellent
3,One for the fans,"I would buy this CD if you want the EXACT recordings of Betty singing her songs straight from the film soundtracks (a lot of people prefer the film versions.) As it says on the back it is a mono recording so the sound quality is not going to be the best in places. I bought it as I wanted to hear her songs from ""Lets Dance"" with Fred Astaire that I couldn't find on any other release."
2,Betty's a bombshell...this cd....well is a miss....,"For Betty Hutton fans, its a bust. The sound quality is off. The charm of Miss Hutton's personality does not come through on this disc nor are the better versions, i.e. studio recordings of some of the songs used. It's sad but I am not sure that there are any ""great"" Betty Hutton recordings out there, however I know this disc could have been better. The Betty Hutton cd release from Capital is MUCH MUCH Better....""Spotlight On Betty Hutton"". If you are looking for Betty Hutton, then look no further than that because there is none better!"
1,Scrambled Eggs Instead of Music,"I am a big Betty Hutton fan. Unfortunately, I will never experience her music with this CD. There are two CDs in this set. The cds wouldn't play in either my car or home cd player. The car player kept indicating an error message and the home player was scrambled and skipped around and cut in and out. I sent the product back and requested a replacement (wishful thinking). I received the replacement. The second CD seemed fine but the first was the same as before only this time it got stuck in my CD player! I got it out, and that product went back too, which is really unfortunate because I've listened to Betty's songs on Youtube, and I really wanted to own my own CD of her music - a clear, unscrambled version. Maybe I got the bottom of the barrel copies as there were only a few left. I don't know. I am trying again with ""Satin and Spurs."" Call me an optimist or a fool, but I am hoping to hear actual music and the talented Betty Hutton."
2,Not Complete,"Monterey Pop: The Criterion Collection is o.k., BUT all of the entertainers were not shown.I had to turn around and order ""The Complete Monterey Pop Festival-1976"" (a two hour DVD) to seeall entertainers that participated at the festival."
3,West Coast Version of Woodstock,"This is for all of us who grew up in the 60s-70s era & yearn for the ""good old days"". This was when the Love Generation was in full flower, pun intended. It is a faithful rendition of that period. The best moment in the whole thing is watching Cass Elliot being blown away by Janis sitting in the first row & wowing a no-holds-barred blues classic. No one had really known of this small town Texas woman who was a one-off original & who was larger than life, & created her own Rock Opera on stage & off."
3,"Classic event, but the editor of the film was high","Ok, so the Monterey Pop festival was obviously an historical event, and one of great notoriety. But as far as a film goes, I was a bit disappointed. The camera man tried to get artful angles, and a lot of the time just ended up getting someone's nose for too long, or a blast of light from the spotlight... it was surprising that the editor of the film actually put some of the shots in! For example, during ""Today"" by Jefferson Airplane, the camera man focused on Grace the whole time, which would have been ok (sort of) if he hadn't caught her from behind! All you see is the outline of her face -- which is only interesting for a second. The music is great, though the sound wasn't so good; the performances are wonderful, though you can't really tell from the editing. All in all, if you want to see most of these performers really rock, get the Woodstock DVD - director's cut! A much better edit too."
3,Somewhat disapointed,"Don't get me wrong, of course this is an awesome video. But I do have to say that is is not what I had expected. They did not show an entire song for most of the bands that performed. They would cut out a few seconds into a performance. It could have been more complete. I want to know why can't we just get the footage of all of it."
4,Nice Glimpse Into A Rock n Roll Era,"I don't have alot to add to the reviews, because most of them are right on. The performances that were captured are excellent and definitly give the viewer a flavor for the whole experience. Every bit of film of the audience was interesting as well. But contrary to the description of the film, it is basically a concert video, and not much of a documentary. You won't see many revealing shots of the artists offstage, or hear many interviews. But it is still excellent and a must see for rock n roll documentary enthusiasts."
5,Great History here,"I enjoyed the film. It was pretty short though and I can't help wondering if there is still film that had not been mastered with the exception of the Jimi Hendrix footage that is out.Also, I heard commentary from a few of the Mama's and Papa's that their performance was not too good, but actually hearing a few tracks from the video, there appeared there was a microphone issue with Michelle Phillips for ""California Dreamin"". I cannot hear her at all. I understand that all of this music was recorded onto an 8 track system, so perhaps they re-mixed her and eliminated her voice completely. Unsure at this point.Performances were all pretty good from all artists, and surprisingly the sound recording was produced well."
5,Great shape,"Disc was in great shape, good concert. Got the disc fast in the mail, right on time.First appearance by three of the bands."
4,Beautiful Documentary,"Beautiful film work. I would have loved to have seen more of the crowd and have a slightly longer film. But the festival seemed so controlled compared to Woodstock that there was probably not much to see of the festival spirit. I couldn't believe that the people actually sat in chairs. They seemed almost passive --I guess you had to have been there. The video is beautifully filmed, and the music great!"
4,Alternative Housebuilding Review,"I went through the options in this very big book before building a vacation cabin in maine, and found it very helpful in explaining design and construction in enough detail to know which systems weren't right for me (like stackwall that i was interested in) as well as the one that would servemy needs best (log)"
1,Garbage product,If you try and tighten the ball on the back of the mirror the plastic piece snaps so easily and it moves like crazy otherwise. Its built like garbage
1,Not worth the money!,I bought this mirror for my sidexside utv. The mirror arrived with a crack in the platic in the rear of the mirror that holds the pivot ball. I glued it and got it back to where it was suppose to be. Installed it on my utv and I couldn't believe how awful it was. It vibrated and you couldn't see out of it. The vibration was not a result of the crack and glue job. Very cheap and not worth buying!!
4,Amazing,"This beautiful piece of work encapsulates electronic musicduring the 90's. It contains magical nuggets of bliss representativeof most forms of electronic music that were born in the 90's. This is possibly System 7's best work, with the notable exception of both versions (the subtle U.K. and more remixed U.S.) of their first album."
3,it's got some luster,"Y2K is an irresistibly bouncing and very bent track that just installed itself in my head for a week straight. It was a very enjoyable experience, and would make the CD worthwhile in itself. The middle of the album isn't as memorable, but the last few songs are stronger.- Ryan"
2,"No, no, NO!","This album is a spectacular example of how the music industry's marketing-driven 'electronica' BS ruined things going into the latter part of the 1990s. Prior to this, System 7 did ""Power of Seven"", which although it was a little unfocussed in spots also contained some intricate and beautiful work, particularly the driving ""Interstate"" and the ""Osmosis Suite"" trilogy of tracks. But _this_...is an atrocious piece of work, an obvious attempt by Hillage to cash in on the whole 'Big Beat' and drum-n-bass mess foisted off on people as marketable 'electronica' of the period. Consequently, it sounded dated by the time the record hit the street, and really doesn't satisfy. Compared to all of the previous System 7 releases, which I listen to from time to time, I think this has been in my player all of twice...once to hear it, and twice to go back and wonder 'gee...was that System 7? How could it suck so _bad_?' Spend your cash on the rest of their stuff, but give this a pass."
4,Battle of Wits is a winner,"Unlike many ""histories"" of code breaking that I've read, this one actually discusses how the process worked which makes the accomplishments that much more outstanding. Very enjoyable and enlightening read."
4,Battle of Wits,"I have only started the book. So far, the book is well written and this particular book is in good shape"
5,Gunsmoke Prevails!,"Both my wife and I are big Gunsmoke fans,we just love Matt,Chester,Kitty and Doc,wouldn't be Gunsmoke without them!!!Its great trying to recognise other actors/actresses that appear that we have seen in other shows or movies.If you love Gunsmoke you will love to collect the whole series without a doubt."
5,There are no words for GREATNESS,AWESOME!!!! It is James Arness at his best -can not wait to get the rest of them..Great collection series.The gang is perfect o.
4,Can't beat a good Western,"Gunsmoke arrived in perfect condition can't believe it is 52years old. The print was crisp and clear, and to add to our enjoyment the first story was ""The Outcast"" with favourite actor Jack Lord - wonderfulthroughly enjoyed it. We refuse to believe it was that long ago we first saw it. Would recommend this to any Western fan. All the stories were great to watch. Thank-you Amazon.com"
4,Who Will Be Alive to Buy Season 7?,"The split season product for the 30 minute episodes is miserable. I bought every one of the half-hour episodes that Columbia House would sell (dozens of 4 episode tapes at $25 each) but that was the only deal available... and the series' were terrific! It amazes me that they are taking so much time to crank these out... because at this pace, the base of consumers is going to be dead before they even start selling season 7! Ought to buy a new hand calculator for those bozos! We all know that the big consumers are going to reside in that segment of the population that was alive in the 50s and 60s. And the sellers are running out the clock? Like we're going to put a buy order in our WILLS!??? There are times when you see things like this in corporate bureaucrats and you wonder why someone doesn't come up with a new sitcom about them called ""Brainless."""
5,Sure To Be A Favorite In Your Collection,"Although nothing short of a comprehensive box set can do full justice to Peggy Lee, this collection will be a welcome addition to any collection, for it includes a number of essential tracks as well several less often heard but equally impressive recordings.In general, the collection focuses on recordings that have a distinctly bluesy undercurrent, such as ""Why Don't You Do Right"" and ""Fever."" At the same time, the collection also manages to find room for such light pop recordings as ""Call Me,"" a killer live recording of ""Well Alright, Okay, You Win,"" and a surprisingly effective cover of River's ""Seventh Son.""Regardless of the specific track, Lee's vocals are superior on every recording and her interpretations--here ranging from the drop-dead restrait of ""For Every Man There's a Woman"" to the sassy ""I'm A Woman""--are Peggy Lee at her finest, irreproachable throughout. Strongly recommended."
5,Just Perfect,"Peggy Lee's smooth,silky voice captures the essence of any song-be it ballads or swing. She sings from the heart and I could listen to her for hours."
5,Delightful and brilliant!,"Sometimes I forget that doctors are just as susceptible to allowing their feelings to get in the way of doing their job as anyone else. This was a great story about a doctor struggling with the feelings he had for the people in his care and how it affected his decision regarding their treatment.I thought the way that Shaw characterized the medical staff was hilarious, and the dilemma he put the doctor in was very intriguing. I couldn't wait to find out who he chose and was tempted to skip ahead to see.This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of his books. I just love his style.I can't resist any chance I can get to peek into the mind of a genius, and Shaw was a true genius. This story was delightful and brilliant."
5,For train lovers of ALL ages,"We got this from Santa for Christmas, because my (almost) 3 year old son loves seeing the Shinkansen (Japanese bullet trains). We read this book at least 3 nights a week, and he's fascinated with all the parts of the trains that I point out as we go along. He may be a bit young to understand how all of them work, but this book definitely helps increase our fascination. It's really great to find out how the trains evolved, and where they're heading in the future. And Dad is into it, too -- especially when they describe the speeds of these over 50 different kinds of trains!You can be any age to be a train lover, and this is a great book to pique the interest. DK, please keep making these awesome books!"
2,Big Book on Trains,"Very few pages and didn't explain much, this was a gift and I was disappointed and ordered The Encylopedia on Trains and Locomotives. I would only recommend this book for a novelty book. I am sure this is not what my grandson was expecting."
3,A solid trio date -- you were asking for more?,"Listeners coming to this disc of trio renditions of standards after having heard Clark albums like _Leaping and Loping_ or _Cool Strutting_ may be a little surprised. These are fine performances owing more to Garland, Jamal, etc. than Bud Powell or Tristano. Worth a listen, though not Clark's best work."
5,"I LISTEN TO NOTHING BUT RAP , BUT THIS IS TOTALLY UNIQUE","I AM FROM MUSKEGON,MICHIGAN AND ALL I REALLY LISTEN TO IS RAP AND AS I LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM, IT JUST BLEW ME AWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A STUPID ALBUM AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING ALL OF THE OTHER SPIRITUAL VIBES. NOTE: IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL THE WAY YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL."
1,Lack of Substance - Not worth the time to read,"This book was horrible! It made absolutely no sense, it's not even funny. It opened poorly but I decided to give it a chance anyway (sorry I did). I was all set to sit down and read something that would really keep me laughing...what a disapointment. I can't believe this book was actually published. I want my [money] back.I gave a ""1"" rating because I had to put something in for the review to take, however, this book really is a big fat ""O""."
3,Kane and Able are back !!!!!!!!!!,"Kane and Ables banging new c.d. This c.d aint all that bad but i still think that ""Am I my brothers keeper"" was the best one they ever dropped. I like ""Shake it like a dog part 2"" and thats about it. I would recommend this c.d to K.D from Woodbridge and people who like NO LIMIT."
5,Great Push Mower,"Easy to put together, use and takes up so little space in the garage. If your lawn mower breaks down and you need to purchase a new one, I would highly recommend this push mower - no mechanical maintenance. The bonus this mower provides? Even our six year can mow the lawn."
1,Does not cut grass,"This ""Push Reel Lawn Mower"" does not cut lawns made of grass. I haven't found anything it cuts except my fingers when trying to adjust the blades. I have tried every height and blade adjustments possible. Everything I can think of to get this bad (and I mean this literally) boy to work. I can cut my very small lawn better with a pair of dull sissors than use this mower. By the way, I have bermuda and rye combination lawn if that makes any difference. If anyone has any ideas on how to get this ""lawn mower"" to work, I would appreciate it. Until then, it sits in my backyard, teasing me as I cut my lawn with a weed wacker."
3,Should have spent more,"I bought this because of the great reviews and the low price. Looking back, I wish I had just spend a little more and gotten a better mower.After reading the reviews, I was prepared that this ,mower might not be able to cut through weeds, sticks, and pretty much anything other than grass. I was ok with that. However, I have found that it has a tough time even cutting through semi-thick. Nothing too tall, maybe 4-5"" tops? It just runs over the grass, flattening it, but not actually cutting. Even on short (just mowed a week ago short) grass, it will cut maybe 60-70% of the grass, but leave lots of random spots that went flat instead of getting cut. I have a REALLY small yard, and this is frustrating. I can only imagine how much more frustration it would be if you were trying to mow a significant amount of grass. Also, the edging ability is basically non-resistant. More flattened grass along the sides."
5,American Reel Mower,"Took all of about 10 minutes to assemble. It is very light, cut through about 6"" of thick bermuda grass in no time at all. Very easy to push, and also lift with one hand. I have a pretty small yard at 25' x 20' so a gas mower was not wanted. I can mow at any time of day or night with how quite it is, and I love how it just minces the grass clippings so it promotes more growth and no bags to dump out."
5,Keeping Yardwork Simple!,"This little guy does an amazing job! I live in a townhouse & just couldn't justify buying a full size mower for my little yard - not only the expense but also storage! This mower is perfect! It gives my grass a clean cut, is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Best of all, it is small & easy to store when I'm finished! Just maintain it with some WD40 & enjoy hassle free mowing - human powered!"
1,Did not work,"Product did not work. In fact, it was just sliding over the grass in my lawn. Would definitely return it."
4,If you enjoy Eugenia Price...,"I have read all of Eugenia Price's books and regret that there are no more. If you enjoy the historical detail of this book and her others, and have not yet discovered Diana Gabaldon's books (Outlander, Voyager, et al), you might give them a try. Like Ms Price's books, they are long, detailed, well-researched and written. Be forewarned however, that, unlike Ms Price's books, Ms Gabaldon's books have more (sometimes a lot more) sensuality and (historically appropriate) violence. If you are comfortable with that, you will enjoy Ms Gabaldon's stories that put you into early Scotland and colonial America (North Carolina area). If you enjoy Ms Price's comfortable and solid faith references, you might like Jan Karon and Curtis Ann Matlock's books."
4,Most enjoyable,"Eugenia Price always writes from the heart. She makes you feel like you are right there in Georgia. Like the St. Augustine trilogy, you won't want to put these books down until you have read all three."
5,Love it,"Eugenia Price wrote excellent books! They always leave you wanting to know more about the characters and families. My family has traveled to St. Simons island and the story's are true to setting, location and characters. The stories are slightly enhanced for easy reading but are still true to historical facts."
5,Excellent Service,"Service was quick and excellent. The book arrived quickly and in good condition just as it was described.Thanks,Darlene"
3,"Traditional Grimson, Slack Storyline","Unfortunately, when I purchased this book, I was hoping that it would be another ""Stainless"". In my opinion, that was Grimson's best work ever. Moving on, the story itself was interesting, but tended to be a little lackadaisical and confusing at times. I caught a slight echo of ""Stainless"" through the characters Freak, Code, and Lisa -- they all seemed the ""lost, neurotic, Hollywood"" types. Still, the book was fine...as long as one isn't perturbed by weird voodoo rituals."
1,horrible!,"This is one of the most bland books I've ever read. Lisa Nova is a spineless moron who wants to get ahead in the film game, does something stupid and gets her butt handed to her, so she decides revenge is the only policy, but she can't do it on her own, even she seems to think she is (that is how deluded she is), but when it gets out of her realm of control, she runs away to her rich Daddy. I do not think men who write in 1st or 3rd person using a female as the protagonist do very convincing jobs of it -- you need to UNDERSTAND your subject matter. He obviously wrote this book just for the sex scenes, and even those are yawn-inducing. This is cliched tripe from Los Angeles and nothing but."
3,Cupid? Fiction turns into ridiculous fantasy.,"Umm...I like the Love and Laughter series, but I think it is awfully weird when the writers throw in these wacky fantasy elements. If I wanted to read a fantasy or science fiction novel (and I don't), I would not have chosen this series. The characters are cute, but really, could we try to keep the relationships on one planet? There is plenty of hilarity here on Earth; you don't need to search the heavens for it. Most things are funny when they are TRUE."
2,Very poor quality,"This rack is not worth the price. the metal is thin, weak and malleable. the foam is cheap pvc insulation. the caps are not even glued on. the hardware it comes with is a joke. your board will deform the racks with any kind of repeated use rendering them useless. if you have a heavy board, these racks will not hold it. Worth about $8 max."
2,Almost bad enough to return.,"There's a reason the pictures they use are low resolution. Don't use this product if you're averse to ugly or cheap products.It's not just that it is made from cheap materials. I'm more annoyed by the fact that they didn't even glue the caps on, and by the fact that they supply bevel-headed screws, but didn't bevel the mounting metal. Sure you can use the ones they supply, it's just uglier and weaker.It does indeed hold my board up, at least for now. It's not worth the hassle of returning, but I would not have bought it if I had seen it in person first. I don't expect it to last long."
5,Tag watch,This was a special birthday gift for my daughter - and it is beautiful! She will wear it for business as well as dress.
3,"Same Television, different channel.","Hikaru just wanted a normal life. She didn't wish to stand out or be noticed in any way, shape or form. But now she is roommates with a female pop star, Izumi Kido, a true TV idol and everybody notices her. Then she finds out that the TV idol everybody loves and worships is NOT a girl. And things go downhill from there. Blackmail, lies and photographs!Interesting idea but between Ramna 1/2 and W Juliet there are already tons of stories about boys being girls for one reason or another. There are a few twists and turns but I found Hikaru quick willingness to give in to Izumi a tad too weird. Or too plot driven?A good story but not a great one. I plan to follow the next few volumes and see what happens from there."
1,"Inconsistent performance, Unreliable","The controller unit is unable to turn on/off the lamps consistently - sometimes it turns on, but not off, usually doesn't work at all. It's too bad, it's a good concept, it just doesn't work."
5,"D'You Smoke Full, Erm... No I don't","I'm only reviewing the track ""I don't smoke"". I first heard this song on holiday and it just has the best mix of lyrics, Beats and all round dancability to it. It is a Drum and Bass song but even if you don't like Dum and Bass you'll still love this song. It doesn't appeal only to junkies it appeals to everyone and has a very interesting lyric base which will have you jumping around to your stereo. My suggestion is buy this track, It's amazing. Trust me."
4,Well-written,"This is a well-written book. It expresses the type of frustration felt by those who understand that the Arab goal is still, as it was in 1948, to drive the Jews into the sea. This book discusses the ways in which the so-called Palestinians have turned their propaganda to make them appear to be the victims and how the international news media have fallen for it. And how that has endangered the world -- for the ultimate goal of Islam is to conquer the world for Islam!"
4,excellent study resource. Keeps truth in perspective.,I appreciate those who are unafraid to tell the truth. If only the leaders of our nation would open their eyes! Recommend this work to all.
3,Children's literature,"I read Silversberg as a child. I found him enjoyable. In many ways his books were very much like longer versions of the fiction I read in Omni magazine. Some Americans call him a 3rd rate hack,but I was on Amazon looking for a copy for my own kids. I robot is better, 2001 is better of course. But this is fantasy to escape (in our case months of winter). RS still gave me hours of escape and kept me reading as a boy. If I had not practiced on his books, I would never have been able to read Dune. If Kilgore Trout were a real author, I think he would write with similar quality."
4,Bancroft towel holder,"Not totally what I was hoping for, but nice. Fits small areas nicely. Stricktly for hand towels or smaller towels/washcloth."
1,Goerner plays like a student (!),Nelson Goerner plays like an amateur. His lecture of Chopin's works is questionable. His interpretation quite poor. Can he read music at all? Is he trying to imitate Argerich? Horowitz? or Arrau?
5,"Oh, Mr Hendrix, why do you play so well?","A Catchy and slightly less breakneck album than a few of the previous, but expertly (how else?) executed, would have been a great answer to the media criticism he was receving prior to his untimely exit. I do wish the ghetto fighters would shut up on ""Freedom"" and ""Isabella"" (I know they were Jimi's friends, but do the album a favour, huh?) although their other contributions are welcome. Mitchell is extravagently immaculate, as per usual. This is an album to jump around your room to and play air guitar to. Or buy the sheet music too (My personal suggestion) and jump around playing along. Ezy Ryder Oozes hendrix, nearly all the tracks are standouts. My slight reservations are that 'Room full of mirrors' was more funky on the deleted 'Voodoo soup' version and 'Pali gap' deserves a place on this album, maybe insted of atsro man which becomes aggrevating. Get out your wallet and buy a big fuzzy wig, then buy this album. Figure out the rest yourselves."
2,A little dissapointed,"After reading all of the reviews on-line here, I bought this cd. I love Jimi and have all three original studio albums, plus Jimi Hendrix: Blues (which is a great cd!). However, I was a little dissapointed with First Rays of the New Rising Sun. A lot of the songs seem unfinished and I don't think the music is nearly as listenable as some of his other stuff. It's too bad Jimi didn't live to finish this music...perhaps it should've just remained unrealesed."
1,"Go find ""Voodoo Soup"" instead!","I can't fault the music, but I can the selection. This is yet another bogus, money-wringing con job on the part of the Hendrix family. If you want the definitive final album from Jimi Hendrix, seek out the deleted (by the family, of course) ""Voodoo Soup"". That disc was produced and compiled by Alan Douglas, the true caretaker of the Hendrix recorded legacy. ""Voodoo Soup"" is as close to what Jimi would likely have released as we'll ever get again. Ignore this and all Experience Hendrix crap and seek out the Alan Douglas releases, ESPECIALLY ""Voodoo Soup""."
2,Jimi repeating himself?,"Jimi hadnt really changed his style since 1966, and there's the problem. It's hard to be objective after his tragic death, but sounds like he's in a rut here. Try his earlier albums."
2,Disappointing.,"Ok, so Jimi had a grand musical vision of a new style and direction. Nothing wrong with that. This can be a good sign, but not always. In my opinion, First Rays is unimpressive and over-hyped. Anyway, what stood out upon first listen was a sort of funkier and more homogenous quality to the songs, compared to much of his earlier material. Unfortunately, the music sounds UNINSPIRED AND EXTREMELY RUSHED. Out of the seventeen tracks, only two really stand out to any degree; the melodic ballad ""Angel"" and the powerful ""Hey Baby(New Rising Sun)"". Yet something is missing from even these two songs that I can't quite put my finger on. I don't really think the ""unfinished"" aspect of First Rays is the main problem with it. Perhaps something else was dominating Hendrix's mind during the sessions other than his music.(Not necessarily drugs either)."
3,Rough rays,Next to the immaculate studio releases this can't help but look like a ragged b-sides compilation with more than a couple reminders as to why his strings were king.
4,a total mess,"This is an incohesive mess. The songs hardly flow together at all. It is saved only by the strength of many of the songs. The best being - In From the Storm, Freedom, Angel, Ezy Ryder, Drifting, Hey baby(new rising sun), and Stepping Stone. Most of which appeared on Voodoo Soup which was a more cohesive collection and is now unfortunatly out of print. i gave this 4 stars because it's jimi freakin' hendrix and subtracting 1 star for occasional poor song choice and order."
3,Trial and error work,"Anyone expecting a greatest hits or a whole album won't find it here.These songs are scattered,mostly experimental works.It is a great shame that THE man never had a chance to fully flesh out these new ideas and take his music to a different level.The best of the collection are ""Angel"",""Dolly Dagger"",""Freedom"",""Drifting"" and the quirky ""Belly button window"".These songs alone make the disc worth having,and they leave you wondering what might have been."
5,Cry of Love Reborn,"No post-psychedelic release meant more to me than ""Cry of Love"". Then it was out of print. Now it has returned...that is, reborn. ""First Rays of the New Rising Sun"" contains everything on ""Cry of Love""; but there's much more (from ""War Heroes"", for instance). Honestly, I never believed I'd say this--it's better than ""Cry of Love"". The extra songs seem meant to have been there in the first place. ""First Rays of the New Rising Sun"" is Hendrix' genius on conclusive display, track after astonishing track. Simply, ""First Rays..."" is the best music of its day."
5,A classic,Some of his best work. Would have taken him to even higher fame. An album that needs to be in any Jimi collection.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I received this lens as part of a package on eBay, along with a Canon XTi. On paper it looked to be better than the Canon kit lens.The image quality is nice although not outstanding. The real gripe I have is that the auto focus is nearly useless. Most of the time, the focus is off just enough that the photo is too soft to be usable. (By ""soft"", I mean ""out of focus"". I know the difference between soft and short DOF.)Occasionally (maybe 10% of the time) the AF will go into what I call ""thrashing."" It will get near the correct focus and then it will jitter back and forth focusing just a bit close then too far, never settling on anything. I'm looking to unload it on eBay, but I doubt I will get enough money to make it worth the effort."
4,much better,Great little lens. I am really happy with Sigma.. this is my second Sigma lens.. although it isn't quite a canon it does a great job.
1,"Pathetic cover art, isn't it?","Don't buy this cheaped down version, the only thing that is the same is the visual, the music, voices and character names are completely different. Its bad enough that the names were changed for the American audience to begin with, but to do it a third time? Really, what a bunch of losers, trying to make money off our memories. I'd give it zero stars if this form would let me."
3,"The original animation, but not the original voices","This is the same Kimba that everyone fell in love with in the 60s, but because of legal problems the soundtrack has been replaced (that's the reason for the title change as well). This is a major disapointment for some of us. The new actors just don't sound right, and Isao Tomita's music is gone as well. As much as two minutes has been removed from each episode (there are two episodes per tape), but if you want to see the original Kimba TV show, there simply is no other home video available."
2,Mr. X is disappointing,"I've read Mr. Straub's work over the years, & Mr. X is uneventful and not in the least bit suspensful. I gave the story a chance, as I was sitting in a hospital for a while. When I finished, I offered it to the trash bin. Koko, Throat, Ghost Story, & co-written Talisman were SO much better! I am a fan, and I do hope he will resume writing in the 'can't take your eyes away' style I have been accustomed to."
2,Not his best,"A very disapointing book. It needs editing. The story line drags along to the point you want to skip pages just to get on with it. Some characters are interesting, such as Ned's aunts, but it's too little. If you want a page turner, this is not the book for you."
3,Flawed but Fun,"""Mr. X"" is typical Straub, at times frustrating, at other times amazing. His style is decidedly not readily accessible at times, but he does possess a superior command of the English languague (which doesn't always make for quick reading....)Ned Dunstan is a likeable enough sort, and his adventures in the search for ""the truth"" are convoluted but interesting. The book takes wild twists and turns, he inherits large sums of money, his mother dies, he hooks up with various women. But the biggest question of the book is, what of his double, Robert?Working in a bit of Lovecraft fare is a cool technique also. This book really cooks in the first half, especially Dunstan's college experience, completely surreal and bizarre.""Mr. X"" is not an easy read by any means, but is ultimately worth it."
2,Interesting Start - Confusion - Unanswered Questions,"I am an avid reader - once engaged in a book, I follow through to the end.To start, the writer got my attention by unvieling a number of different paths the storyline could take by introducing many interesting characters. However, the author failed to round out their full story and place of significance in the book. Untimately, the writer leaves the reader hanging on the demnise of a few characters..void of closure.Mousie...alien, deformed child...what?? Does anyone really know what happened to Ned's brother? What was the significance of Ned recalling Star's moment in the auditorium throughout the book? Are the powers inherited or are they part of some alien personification?If you read this book, prepare for alot of unanswered questions."
2,Just could not keep interested!,"Mr. X has been a disappointment. I was looking forward to spending some time engrossed in a multi plotted, richly characterized book, but found it boring and hard to keep track of characters. Most of the time I was a bit lost and as a result never had the drive to pick up the book to continue reading. I did get through it but just because I am anxious to move to another book. This book had unrealized potential."
2,"Fans of Lovecraft LIKE revulsion, right?","I just finished it, and feel relief. I hate to leave things unfinished, especially when I've given them so many second chances. It's blue-collar doesn't match the money from the sky, or the shadow out of time.This book was recommended by my beloved paperback eating machine of a grandmother, likely because she knows I like creepy stuff, not because I'm well-read.The content is fun enough, for an 80s story that wants us to believe it's a 90s story, but the style begs so desperately for the 'clever yet not pretentious' badge that it ends up less than pretentious, merely pedestrian.Two stars instead of one because it wasn't bad for its ilk, two instead of three because it wan't as good as it thought it was."
1,Do not waste your money!!!,"I was determined to finish this book. Eventhough, it was the most hard to follow, confusing and BORING book that I have ever read! It is definitely not a page turner. I was not thrilled, horrified or left in suspense. I kept on reading in the hope it would all come together and make sense. That never happened."
1,Started slow then fizzled out altogether,"This book was so dreadfully slow I could not finish it. Horror fiction should grab you. This story never did.A lot of family history with no substance or relevance. I also found the fact that every woman who meets whatshisface falls head over heels for him to be ridiculous. The H.P Lovecraft connection was stretching it. Readers would be better advised to try Lovecraft. Or for new horror fiction, try Douglas Clegg-he will grab you from the start and never let go, especially You Come When I Call You, or The Nightmare Chronicles. Lets face it, if we want superb writing technique(with no interesting story attached)we'll look elsewhere. When I buy a book like this I just want to be entertained. I liked other Straub books however."
2,Peter Straub misses the mark with this one.,"I have enjoyed Peter Straub's books for years, especially The Throat and Mystery. Mr.X is not in their league. It is too slowly paced and way too long. The conclusion concerning Ned and Robert is not well crafted. The Lovecraftian themes miss the mark and the horror aspects just aren't there. Every author has a stinker of book now and then, and Peter Straub has his."
1,X-crement!,"I thought 'Mr. X' had promise, but it quickly degenerated into another dry, slow-moving, exercise in tedium. The sheer number of supporting characters, along with their cliched 'midwestern hick' behavior, their 'Waltons-esque' names, and the pointlessnes of the whole story, sapped all the excitement out of it. It's an unoriginal premise, done much better by King, Koontz, and nearly everyone else who has ever written about 'opposite sides' of our personalities. Read 'The Dark Half' or 'Mr. Murder' instead, and leave the 'schmaltzy scary small town' dramatics to TV soap operas."
2,Wish I hadn't wasted the money.,"Overlong, overloaded with extraneous subplots, utterly lacking in fantasy, magic OR horror, redundant and repetitious, I dragged myself through this one. Don't tell me it's subtle, either; it's not, it's just not very good. A good author on a bad outing. Reread KOKO instead."
2,A STRUGGLE TO READ - MR. X,"Although the section about the fathers boarding school did keep me attentive, the rest of the book dragged horribly. I expected so much better and kept forcing myself to pick it up and read on. The initial concept is excellent, however, bringing it to fruition seems to have been out of reach for Mr. Straub."
2,Self-important & pretentious,"It pains me to say anything bad about a Peter Straub book. I have been a fan for nearly 20 years. Koko still rates as one of my all time favorite reads, bar none. Mystery & The Throat were sorely disappointing, but Hellfire Club promised a return to form. A return to the horror genre by my favorite author...well, what more could I ask for? Much, in retrospect. Mr X contains more ponderous, pretentious prose than any Straub novel to date. Descriptions of places, persons, and situations drag on ad nauseum. Even the names of characters are distractingly silly. Do yourself a favor, skip this palid, self- important attempt at a modern addition to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and read the original."
3,He can and has done much better,"Stop all the bitchin' at each other. So there's disagreement about this book-that's why they make chocolate and vanilla, Chill out. The book was decidedly mediocre (in my opinion), and those who called for editing are correct (in my opinion). There is nothing wrong with long narrative or description if well done and crucial to the plot. The problem here is that much of the book is neither."
2,Just plain boring....,"I've read King and Barker for the last 15 years and enjoyed both a lot. I bought Mr. X based on King's ""recommendation"" on the front cover.....bad move. Unfortunately, Straub seems to like long, dragged out stories and incredibly short, small climaxes. I found the main, and sub-, storylines tedious, the climax (after 3/4 of the book) a major anti-climax and the context superficial. I would not recommend this book to anybody. Want to give thriller/horror a try? Go to Misery by King."
1,Ouch!,"Hardcore Straub fans should avoid this hackneyed drivel like the plague, lest they end up holding a grudge. Transparent plot and characters are balanced out by painfully insipid dialogue. The only reason I bothered finishing this bomb was because by the time I realized things weren't going to get any better I had invested too much time to quit. Get out while you can! (and check out KOKO or Mystery instead, or even again, if you must)."
5,A Great Thriller With Lovecraftian Sensibilities,"Straub crafts a thriller led by protagonist Ned Dunston, who returns to attend the funeral of his mother and finds himself the lead suspect in several murders.Along the way he find that the ""shadowy"" twin brother that he recalls from his youth does exist -- though is still shadowy -- and uncovers secrets surrounding his mother, unmet father, his family background and powers.A Lovecraftian theme is weaved throughout and in true style of HP, the reader is left with the understanding that the world is not as normal as it seems and deep down is quite disturbing.A strong recommendation from anyone interested in thrillers with a Lovecraft theme."
3,"Not so good, not so bad...","This was my first Peter Straub novel, and although I liked the basic plot of the story and almost all the characters, there were times I was reading, and Straub just seemed to go on about something or other that was supposed to tie into the book. If it weren't for the actual plot, I would've quit before it got good. It did end kind of crummy, for my liking. But, overall if you are a fan of Straub, read this. If not, you aren't missing anything."
3,Mr. X entertains,"I liked the way the mysteries in this book slowly unravel, loved the eccentric family of the main character, and enjoyed the way he grew into his heritage. I was intrigued by the ""dark"" twin, Robert, and enjoyed the way the author left his fate uncertain at the end. I also particularly enjoyed the gap between the perception and reality of the title character, Mr. X, who thinks he is a demonic demigod, and turns out to be something somewhat less than that. What I didn't enjoy were the long, rambling chapters from Mr. X's viewpoint, which frankly bored me, and the way some mysteries were brought up and then dropped(why are some of the people Mr. X chases long-lost Dunstans? What is the cause of the Knacker?). A fun ride and left me with lots to think about, but I think his previous books, especially Mystery, were more skilled."
1,not recommended,"If it will help anyone decide:I did NOT like Ghost Story, Koko, Mrs. God.I ABSOLUTELY LOVED The Hellfire Club, Mystery, The Throat, Shadowland.I did NOT like this one. It just wasn't interesting. It never took off. I couldn't finished."
1,Poor offering,"I read up to a dozen paperbacks per months. Thrillers, mystery, detective ..... and recently Mr. X by Peter Staub. A waste of time. The story rambles. The storyline is unclear. The author seems to think that the reader can anticipate what is going on. Poor showing, Mr. Staub."
1,WARNING ! WARNING ! Mr. X - SUX,"Not even worth one star. Ignore any reviews that praise this, they have been put there by the publisher or friends of Straub. This is the first book in my life I could not finish. I still shiver at the thougt of going back to it so I was forced to make kindling of it. Absolutely the worst book I have ever read. And I read a lot ! I have read other Peter Straub books and I can't imagine that this is the same writer."
1,Franks and Beans,"Sometimes you can get tired of eating fine, rich foods. Sometimes you want to go slumming at the local greasy spoon and get back to the raw basics of middle American dining. With books it doesn't quite work that way. You never get tired of reading fine books which is why this franks and beans offering from Straub should be avoided at all costs. Disregard this warning at the risk of causing irreperable damage to your finer sensibilities."
1,Never Again!,"This book confirms my earlier opinion that Peter Straub is a one-hit wonder. ""Ghost Story"" was the only book he ever wrote that I really liked. ""Mr. X"" had so much promise in the beginning, but Straub failed to deliver the goods. The Lovecraft connection was obvious right away to anyone who is familiar with that great author of his time. All in all, I felt too many loose ends were left dangling."
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I was disappointed with Mr. X. I thought Mr. X was going to be more of a thriller rather than an expose on a supernatural family. It was Lovecraftian, I'll give it that. I just couldn't buy into the characters or writing style."
1,Not Worth the Time,"Although I've been a fan of Straub's this book is NOT worth it. The storyline moves in too many directions. There are too many illogical connections. It was also poorly edited (the main character is poured a drink of whiskey, but somehow his first gulp is of scotch, and then the drink becomes whiskey again). Don't bother with it."
1,STRUGGLING,I am on page 404 and I am determind to finish this book if it kills me. I think that it probably will.
2,Big Let Down,"Thank goodness I bought this used. This book reminded me of a lot of horror movies...great beginning, great premise....BIG LET DOWN in an Anne Rice ""Taltos"" way. Straub's other books are much more compelling and creepy."
5,They don't make rock albums like this any more...,"I remember listening to this album over and over on my stereo, cranked into headphones thinking... these guys know how to rock! The songs just grab you... they have a big-guitar southern rock flavor with at times, a native-american or southwestern border feel. The songs vary in nature from wild and free to sad and soulful. The live show they put on at the time of this album was definitely the most rockin' wall of guitar/bass/drums I've ever heard in my life... and I believe it still is to this day."
4,kicks like karate!!!,"I heard this guy on the the Trancespotting compilations (My Wonderful Friend and Take Over). He has a very tightly wound, flashy, ornamented sound, complete with tastefully placed swearing cartoon voices...sort of the sonic equivalent to those old Japanese Godzilla movies...a true guilty pleasure!!!!!"
5,DANCE TILL YOU CAN'T DANCE NO MORE!,"If you enjoyed those unforgettable 80s when freestyle dance music ruled, then don't miss the memories this CD brings back to you."
5,rare vintage video of Ella,"From what I've seen and heard thus far of the Jazz Icons series, the DVD's of Ella and Sarah are superb, and are wonderful additions to the music libraries of all who are interested in the artistry and musicianship of these great singers. Not only were they loved in their own country, as witnessed by this footage, they were undoubtedly among the very best good will ambassadors America has produced."
1,Terrible car seat,"We love Corolle's products--we have just about everything they make. So I give this car seat/ infant carrier a low rating with great disappointment. I had high hopes for it. The problem is the design. The handle doesn't ""lock"" into place, so the baby falls onto the floor, which is very sad for our girl and her doll."
3,Toy infant carrier,"The only reason I purchased this product through Amazon was because I had difficulty finding one in the stores. When I finally found one at WalMart, it was half the cost of Amazon's."
1,Save Your Money!!!!,"My son who loves Thomas the Tank Engine, and has a bunch of Thomas sets now including this Waste Of Money. I paid a lil over $100 for this item and after 30 min or so of putting this Unstable mess together my son had it trashed within seconds so unless you feel like buying tons of Liquid Nails to keep this ROLLERCOASTER set Together Save Your Money, it is a toy that will probably frustrate most children as it did my son. A nice alternative is the Thomas Bolder Mountain which is a lil more stable.Hope this Helps!!!!!THUMBS DOWN"
3,Great Concept poor execution......,"Sometimes i think i get more excited about certain destinations then my boys do, In this case i love destinations based on the stories we read and watch on tv. I agree with some reviewers that this destination is poorly thought out, i suppose they think we all nail or glue or tracks down like there demo tables. They now have a new semi-version called Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway- Race Down The Rails Playset. I have not owned this version but it does appear handled the problem of the tracks falling of the risers."
4,old men and beautiful prose,"Who but Updike could write a novel about a bunch of grumbling, poor old men and make it a thing of beauty. This is one of Updike's most poetic works, a world completely saturated in self-absorbed imagery, causing the book to writhe with life even though all the characters are either very old or pathetic. Surprisingly there is no adultery in this novel(!), but it is still easily recognizable as Updike by the nature of the gloom and doom observations. Althought the plot itself was a little weak, it seemed really to make no difference; the plot is merely the background which is there simply to showcase the richness and boldness of Updike's prose."
1,Terrible DVD!!!!!!!!!!,"This DVD is in SUPER full-frame. Super here is not a good word. It's headache inducing how it's so zoomed in. The movie itself is supposed to be a classic, but you will have no opportunity to tell as it is impossible to see any of what's going on on this DVD print. Cross your fingers and hope somebody else puts it out in better form."
1,Do not buy this!,"I question the legitimacy of this version. It looks and sounds like a digital copy of a very old and worn out VHS bootleg! The soundtrack is unbelievably bad which, other than the spoken voices, has each sound being an echo of itself. And when the camera zooms, it's far too much, and it even jumps around, which makes certain scenes even more difficult to watch.As for the movie itself, it's a standard revenge story, but with a female revenge-seeker. The female actor does a decent job, given the sub-par choreography. But this version of it, likely a bootleg, is utterly horrible!"
4,nice classic rave sounds,"808 State were giant influences on techno and rave, this CD may not contain the groups most prolific moments (as the earlier two had), but nonetheless it's a great listen. I actually find the reworking of UB40's ""One In Ten"" into a 140 bpm techno track as kind of neat. And, being a fan of Echo & the Bunnymen, like the cameo of Ian McCulloch on Moses. The rest of the CD is pure intrigue. Great synth sounds. Count the analogs. Nice rythms."
3,"It's OK, but don't devote your life to its admiration.","To make no bones about it: this music is simple and dated, not unlike early works of Moby and Prodigy. This apparent gripe makes many of these tracks downright catchy as all heck. Many take on an angelic aura; others are considerably less inspired. Whereas I usually complain about vocals (let alone actual lyrics) in techno, the human touches add to these tracks and are pivotal in breaking synthy monotony. This probably sounds harsh, but I like the album well enough--as a whole it's just not top rack techno, though."
3,"half cheese, half cool--but for ... it's not bad!","I was browsing through my local Hock Shop and found this in the clearance section--... ... (I ended up striking a deal with the clerk and he lowered it to ...). I had only heard a few songs by 808 state from his newer releases, so I was intrigued. was it worth what I paid? definately. but if it were [more]--I would think again. at first I took it as a cheesy euro-techno album (because the several of the first tracks were) but then I really got into it on track 7 (orbit) all the way to track 13 (stormin norman). so since 7 tracks were good all the way through, I'll keep it in my CD collection. Gorgeous has a really nice retro-synth sound with some ravey synth mixed in. there were a few tracks that reminded me of a mix between industrial/jungle. maybe I'm just crazy. not bad.highlights moses, orbit, black morpheus, southern cross, nimbus, colony, timebomb."
1,Any realtor could write a simpler and better book,"We don't live in pristine castles and we don't sell homes as such. I do wonder where Feng Shui came in, other than clearing the clutter???"
4,"Bond? Yes, indeed!","As an aside to this excellent book, it can be mentioned that Mjr. Boothroyd recommended to Ian Fleming that his new spy-story main character should use the new Walther PPK. That's right. The agent in question was James Bond, agent 007 of her British Majestys MI6. And, as a thank you, Mjr. Boothroyd appeared in the stories, and later the movies, as Q, the Equipment Officer."
3,Their best Work,"Like De la, Das EFX, and a tribe call quest, naughty by nature's sophomore CD, to my mind, was way superior to their debut. Yes I know that that debut included 'O.P.P' but as an album it's not one that i kept in heavy rotation. But listening to this CD reminds me of the days when I would LOVED Hip hop. Now I would never say that Treach was in my top tem MC's of all time, and, even after all this time I couldn't quote you a memorable line from any of his rhymes, but he has a nice flow that accompanies the joints on this CD( Vin Rock would come in every now & then, more so on this CD, similar, but to a lesser effect than Phife Dawg on tribe's excellent 'Low End Theory CD') Kay Gee's production is a mixture of Horns breaks, and piano samples, that still sound fresh. Tracks I dig are: Hip Hop Horary (great video by Spike Lee) it's on (with a great horn break) and Hot Potato, with an excellent cameo by Mr. Bumpy Knuckles himself, Freddie Foxxx. These toons standout on a good CD."
3,Once again it's on!....................,3.5 stars: Treach is one of the greatest MC's of alltime!Top Joints:It's OnWritten on KittenHot Potato w/Freddy FoxxReady for DemTake it to ya Face
2,Karl Bartos Do Better...,"I hear the complete CD and... Wait a minute... ¿This is a ex-member of kraftwerk? Yes. And I'm dissapoint right now and that s**t day. A life I apport in kraftwerk, BUT I CAN'T BUY THIS! Hello to everybody, and visit my site to consult and download all the mp3 you want for free: www.kraftworld.es.vg.Thanks for your time!"
3,"A good source, depending on what you're looking for.","This book has lots of sources for students needing money for school. HOWEVER, most of the money is for students seeking a PhD, as opposed to a Master's. Still, don't let this get you down, as you just might find what you need."
2,Mostly for PHD candidates,"The biggest complaint with this book is its organization. The chapters are broken down with business, law and health all together. Which makes it really hard to find something specifically in business. Another problem is the fact that most of the grants are for PHD candidates and alot are school specific."
4,History,"Kudos to Ted for good dissection of what happened to rap. Things, unfortunately, won't ""get back to balance""... All of that is now history, just like D.U.'s great work and the rest of artists mentioned (true greats). Music industry eats its own children. It is all about money, not art. Enjoy it while it lasts. Fortunately, time hadn't distroyed this stuff, yet. Buy it while you can."
5,Tha Bay In Tha AK,"This CD is One of Dre's Best. One of his first releses after gettin outta jail. He came out firing on this one and was happy to be doing his thing again. Tracks 2,8,10 and 15 are the standout tracks, but if you're a true fan you gotta have this one, better yet you already should have! Rest In Peace and Much Love"
5,stupid doo doo dumb,STR8 FIRE-smooth pimp vocalz & clean beatz from start ta finish gettin stupid doo doo dumb w/it...all of mac dre's(r.i.p.) albums are f**kin tight bottom line... so copp 'em!
1,Not what you think!!!,This book does not cover any CNC material. It's just a test book. Doesn't include any software either.
3,A view of the cats perspective,"My 4 cats will drink the water with the breathalyzer mixed into the water, but they prefer plain old water. I have two cats that would benefit greatly (and thus was recommended from their vet) that I purchases this product to aid in the red flaming gums they have. I have not seen a 100% improvement, but it has only been a few months and we alter the mixed water with clean tap water. Obviously the cats can tell something is in their water."
5,Best chocolate Ever!,The Lindt Excellence Intense Orange Dark Chocolate Bar is my most favorite chocolate bar in the world! Nothing else compares.
3,Pass it.,The orange flavor is too weak.But the bars contained some nuts.They are also not too sweet. however.Will not order more.
3,Lindt Excellence Intense Orange Dark Chocolate,"This is a tough one. These things really taste GREAT, but get ready for a HUGH sugar hit. I would like to see this product with darker chocolate and less sugar."
2,A great story poorly serviced,"The murder-by-torture of the cooper's wife Bridget Cleary at the hands of her husband and family members, who thought she was a fairy changeling, would seem to be almost entirely resistant to narratorial ineptitude. The 1895 incident in rural Tipperary seems to distill all of the fin-de-siecle British Empire's obsession with darkness and horror at the margins of its own civilization, and the story in and of itself should make a rattling good read. Angela Bourke, however, seems utterly incapable of telling a good story: there is little narrative logic to her recounting of events and background historical materials, and she repeatedly refuses to make transitions between the micro-history of Cleary's death and the surrounding wider issues of the day. As a result, the fascinating implications of the murder and its aftermath (with respect to gender, nationality, sex and even race) are often ineptly presented, and the story itself becomes dull and uninvolving."
2,This is basically a school paper,"The story is 239 pages long. Upon turning page 239, to see what the rest of the book is about, you see Acknowledgments and Sources. The very first sentence says it all! ""This book began life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1993, as a chapter in a projected academic work on Irish fairy legend,"" If I had seen the words ""academic project"" on the product page I would not have purchased it. This book droned on and on.I do not recommend this book."
3,Random Story,This story about a guy who kills his wife and blames it on fairies actually kept my interest but just because of how bizarre it was.
1,Almost Unreadable,This should have been a compelling story. Instead the reader has to piece the details of the crime together as the author goes off on endless tangents. These tangents are supposed to illustrate historical and folklorical Ireland. The crime surely could have been a very fascinating read if it weren't for the abundance of nonsense that overhwelms it. Some of the history and folklore is certainly relevant but there is much too much. I found myself skipping through stories of Oscar Wilde (?!) just to get to the next portion of the murder tale. This book is unclear and verbose at the same time. A decent true crime writer could very easily have made this incredible story into a readable account..even while including history.
2,A Book With the Wrong Title,"""The Burning of Bridget Cleary"" would more appropriately be titled ""What Was Happening in Ireland when Bridget Cleary was Burned."" Don't the book expecting to read specifically about the injustice done to Bridget Cleary and the events that led up to it; this book talks more about Irish history and laws than it does about the actual burning. The story itself is just as hard to understand; the author will tell a small part of the story, then launch into 5 pages of history. By the time you reach the next part of the story, you've forgotten where you left off.This is a fantastic book to read if you want a look at late nineteenth century culture and government. If you're looking for the story of Bridget Cleary, look elsewhere."
1,"Mysteriously, this is murderously dull reading","This book focuses on a fascinating subject but the material is presented in the excrutiating prose style I associate with doctoral dissertations. We get every trivial detail about stuff no one could possibly care about, but very little insight into the major characters involved in the murder."
3,"It's good, but different from their first album.","Everlast makes this album good,he doesn't make up for an album that is somewhat dull . ""It ain't a crime if you don't get caught"" is a good example of a song that tells a good story with lyrics that should shut up any fool who calls the group a flash in the pan. But there aren't any hit songs like ""Jump Around"" that make it stand out. R&B softies won't appreciate this album's strength, which is its lyrics."
4,MASTERPIECE,House of Pain (Same as it ever was) is a great album.The remix to word is bond produced by my man Diamond D is mad phat phat phat word.
4,Same As It Ever Was....The Best Of House Of Pain,"Everlast........Tommy Boy........DJ Lethal...... They're back and they're better than ever. Now most people are probably going to scoff at me for putting this album ahead of their first one but to be blunt, Everlast's lyrics are twice as tight. (For example in ""Back From The Dead"" Everlast says, ""Spreadin' like rumors, gossip and lies. Exagerated reports of my demise.""and from there the verses proceed to get better.) And DJ Lethal's beats are twice as good. Now that doesn't mean that any song on this album compares to the classic ""Jump Around"",because none do, but the overall quality of this album is much, much better. Nowhere on this album will you find any signs of the group tiring, as was the case with their first album. House of Pain has etched a name for themselves, they surely won't relent now."
3,Good but,"The book is great for differentiating the subtle differences among the many similar personality disorders. For that reason alone it's worth the hefty price knowing what classification your symptoms fall under.However, not long into the book my antennae came up. What's with all the gay stuff? Not only does he present an equal number (or more?) of gay examples but you get the uneasy sense of someone really hooked on gays. I later assume from what I've read about him he is gay himself so that solves the mystery."
3,"Flawed, but interesting","Someone sent me a link to a Black Pyramid song on YouTube, and I loved it. It reminded me a lot of Sleep (one of my favorite bands). So I bought this album. The song that hooked me isn't on this CD.What *IS* here is a mixture of stoner rock, psychedelia and old-school metal riffs. At times they sound like a cross between Pink Floyd and Motorhead. It's a facinating hybrid, but it doesn't gel completely. I keep wishing the tempo of some songs would slow down and lock into a doomier groove. But there are some good riffs, and spacey atmospheres... maybe too spacey at times. They like layering vocals parts, and sometimes two singers are doing totally different melodies and lyrics at the same time. It gets disorienting.All in all, this CD shows a lot of promise. Hopefully their new self-titled album is heavier and more coherant."
2,Bit of a bore...,"I had hopes that this book would help to spice up our evenings, but was quickly disappointed to find that I would have better luck watching television. The stories main events were rushed and lack luster. These ""ingenious"" rewrites of classic fairytales were completely dull. I would suggest that you save your money and pass on this one."
2,Uneven album,"Chico and Coolwadda - the album - is an uneven release. The best cuts on the album are the g-funk tracks Godzilla like and High Cum Down, where Nate Dogg lays down the hook on the interpolation of Evelyn King's 80s hit Love Come Down. The rest of the album is a mediocre affair with average production and beats. None of the other tracks stand out. Chico and Coolwadda should have stayed truer to their West Coast roots and had more g-funk tracks on their album since their flow fits best with the Warren G sounding production that is featured on Godzilla and High Cum Down. People who only heard the radio friendly High Come Down will be disappoointed by this album and I predi that there will be a surplus of used copies available soon."
1,sp2 users BEWARE!!!!!!!,"If you have Win XP sp2 DO NOT BUY ANY SANDISK READER!!!I recieved this reader for a Christmas present2 days ago(I opened it early), and I tried to install it on my computer (win XP with service Pack 2).It refused to install correctly so I emailed SanDisk support and they finally told me that NONE of thier memory card readers will work with sp2. The problem is that the information isn't available anywhere on thier site or in any ad!!!Now AMAZON wants to charge me for returning this useless reader that I had no way of knowing wasn't supported on sp2.All the info available for SanDisk readers say that they will work with Win XP and there is NO mention of sp2."
5,looks good and acts fast,"I wanted a card reader that I could take on the road with me and be fast at downloading from my memory cards. The bonus I got was that this product also looks OK on the desk.I use it with xD, smart media and CF cards and all have worked flawlessly. I find downloads are quicker than my old ""internal"" card reader and installation was as easy as it gets for WinXP: simply plug it in and use it!And if, like me, you get lost with the 4 resulting 'drives' that come up in your file manager and you can never remember which is which, try switching the drive letters to remind you about the memory card you're using. For example I use X: for the xD card, F: for the Flash card, etc. I know I'm dumb and that helps me remember which drive to go to every time.Thoroughly recommended.Happy shopping.JB"
4,OK but not for xD Type H Cards,"Since this is a long discontinued product, I'm posting for the record only as I didn't see reference to this issue. I've used this reader for years with no complaints under XP SP1 and 2. However, it does not support Type H (high speed) xD picture cards. At least mine doesn't, and I was unable to find any trace of a fix. Everything else I've thrown at it, SmartMedia, SD and xD, worked fine."
5,Worked as expected -- pleased with purchase.,The Reader worked as advertised. I'm very pleased with the purchase...
5,Works fine with XP Service Pack 2,"One review of this item says it does not work with XP SP2.In my case that is incorrect. Took it out of box, plugged it into USB2 slot and XP SP2 recognized it immediately and each slot shows up as a drive in ""My Computer""Works perfect. Highly recommended."
1,worked for while,"I purchsed the reader from Costco about 5 month ago. I been using Lexar 512M CF and 256M kingston cards. It worked fine most of the time, once in while power LED goes off and had to wiggle the cable to make it work, until last week. The LED wouldn't come on and reader is not recognized, so I retruned to costco and got my money back (good thing it was from Costco). I als but sandisk 256mb USB2.0 key and that also failed on me. so far Sandisk makes good POS that has failed 2/2."
1,Plain Junk,The thing worked for about a week and then quit- Some cards read and others don't. I had to quit using it altogether. I have had good luck with SanDisk products in the past but this one is a bomb. Buy something else.
1,Warning! Beware of rebate Ripoffs by SanDisk.,I bought this product several month ago from Amazon.com. It came with a $20 rebate. I filled out the rebate exactly as described. I was told the rebate would arrive within 12 weeks. Instead I got a form letter telling me that the rebate wasn't accepted. When I called to ask why I was hung up on repeatedly. They never would give me a reason. Tech support is TERRIBLE. This company is dishonest. Avoid at all costs.
4,works for me,"I have had this since May, plugged into my Mac G5 thru a USB 2 hub, I dont use it much but it works for me."
1,Nothing but PROBLEMS !,This Sandisk Reader freezes my computer everytime I plug in a memory card to download. I thought it might be my computer so I reloaded the drivers and tried again. Same problem ! I thought it might be my ME operating system so I tried it on an XP computer. Same problem ! I called Sandisk and they said they would send me a FEDEX box to return it in. That was 8 days ago and still no return box. They also said it would take 7 -10 after they got it back. It looks like I'm looking at being without a memory card reader for at least a month. Next time I'm not buying electronics mail order. I'm buying from a local store where I can return the piece of junk the next day and buy one that works so I can get on with my life.
1,Discontinued Model,"Don't bother buying it since it is discontinued from the manufacturer. Plus, this doesn't work out of the box. Junk."
5,Everything you could want,"This read works wondefully. First off, don't underestimate the importance of a USB 2.0 connection. That alone makes it about 40 times faster than USB 1.0 and 1.1 card readers.I have a Samsung SPH-i600 that I transfer mp3s and mpgs to. Before it would take about 30 seconds to transfer a single 4MB song. Now I can transfer about fifteen 4MB songs in 30 seconds. It makes a world of difference.Also, it is very easy to setup if you have Windows XP. All you do is literally plug it in, wait about 30 seconds for the drivers to automatically install, and then you are done.I couldn't ask for anything more."
4,Works great on Linux with 2.6.11 kernel,"I got this card reader recently to use with my Linux system. I am running Debian Sarge (3.0R1a) with 2.6.11.5 kernel. I was apprehensive about being able to use it ater having read a couple of other reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it works very well with Linux. I simply plugged it in and voila, Linux kernel saw all 4 slots on the reader and it was fully functional at USB 2.0 hi-speed."
5,Excellent product!,"This is an excellent card reader. The base is suprisingly heavy allowing it to sit on my desk very well. Hook up and use was a breeze, even for a computer incompetent as myself!! Get one today and make your life much easier!!"
5,Like a spa treatment,I first became aware of this product during a hospital stay and fell in love with it. The all in one feature is great for travel and sports bag. You just don't see it on the shelves anywhere so I'm thrilled I can get it this way through Amazon.
4,Great product,"I use this to bathe my newborn baby and to wash accessories of breat pump. It is easy to rinse, no irritation. Great for babies!"
3,Was sent the wrong item...and it took awhile to get it!,"What I ordered (and what was pictured) was the Aloe Vesta 2-n-1 body wash and shampoo in a creme form. What was shipped to me was a foam. I had ordered another item on Amazon (from a different company). Both items were in stock...but it took about 3 days longer to get this item...and it was wrong (not what I ordered). Because I am housebound, I kept it...but will think twice about ordering again."
5,Just fantastic!,"My husband who is 95 and has just had surgery on his foot was told not to get it wet! Yes you can try to tape a bag on the leg etc. etc. But it's risky. I trawled through Amazon looking for a product that he could use for the week or so that he would be unable to get in the shower. There are many, but with this foam, the reviews were excellent. And for good reason! It works! My husband who loves his shower, was more than pleased and satisfied. He said it made him feel clean, truly clean and easy to use everywehre. I can't say enough good about this product. So helpful and so easy and so affordable. Bless Amazon for carrying it."
1,Worthless toy,I received this as a Christmas present from my daughter.Unfortunately this expensive trinket is worthless.Measurements are inconsistent and inaccurate. The tool is also a pain to use. Don't waste your money.
1,Poor Product....,"...probably one of the worst tool investments I've ever made. Extremely inaccurate, repeats errors, too sensitive to anything in the space being measured, what a waste of money!"
1,Doesn't measure up!,"This thing is little better than a toy. The accuracy of measurements is accurate but only some of the time. I often get a reading of ""Err"" when trying to check distances. And other times I'll get wildly varying readings. I'll probably be returning this as defective."
5,Perfect Estimating Tool,"If you are a Real Estate Agent, a Carpenter, or do anything with Painting, Flooring, Wall-paper, etc, then this is the tool! I am a Real Estate Developer and this has become a perfect tool.Whether finding the square footage of a property, or helping to get the estimates on upgrades and improvements such as painting and carpeting, it makes it SIMPLE to get accurate square and cubic footage calculations. This is not for perfect, exact measurements, but is PERFECT for estimating!I recommend this to any DIY'er"
2,Inaccurate packaging description,"Don't buy this Stait-Line product if you need to measure with an accuracty greater than whole inches. The package promises great accuracy, but if you need to measure a room which is, say, 9'-4 3/8"" wide, this laser tape will give adjust the measurement up or down (to 9'-4"" in this case). I wish the packaging for this product had described this aspect of this laser tape, but you won't learn this until you either use the tape or read the Owner's Manual (which is tucked inside the sealed package)."
1,Only works on flat walls that face you & are the right color,"I purchased this Laser Tape to measure the spacing of trees in a field, which it cannot do. It seems to only be able to measure the distance to a very smooth surface that is at the right angle to bounce the light back to you. And the surface's color seems to disrupt the measurement as well. If all these conditions aren't met, you don't just get a false reading, you get nothing at all. The packaging says nothing about this. Not only did the device fail to work in the yard, it often failed indoors as well. I wanted this to work -- it seems like a great timesaver and kinda fun -- but I finally returned it. It didn't come in handy one single time."
1,This product is an embarrassement,"I bought this product for my dad for Christmas, and after trying to use it for a few days we both gave up.People don't buy this product, or worse give it as a gift. I felt like a fool for giving it to my dad."
2,does it measure up?,the laser measuring tape will sometimes give more than one measurement which can be very hard to decifer which is correct conventional tapes much more accurate.
1,Always off by at least a half an inch,"I got this for Christmas as well, and was planning on using it for measuring distances for cutting baseboard, chair rails and crown mouldings. It's a good thing that I double-checked with a conventional tape before cutting, because there's no way this device should be used for anything requiring accuracy.Even on short measurements, the thing was always off compared to a conventional tape."
1,Should not be on the market.,"Why would anyone sell a measuring product that is only accurate to within an inch? I bought this product thinking it would replace measuring tape. I was very wrong. If you want a laser measuring device either purchase the more expensive ones on the market that do measure within 1/8th inch, or wait for the prices to come done on those products. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Very unreliable. Not ready for prime time product.,"It seems amazing to me that this product was released for public consumption being as unreliable as it is, without proper testing/debugging. I tried using this device many times and the readings produced are consistently unreliable. Even at short or known distances (say 10 ft) the device produced readings that were unquestionably off. For instance, measuring a wall that is 10 feet away could give you a reading of 36 ft, and so on. Not only that, it's not just a matter a taking several reading and see which one comes up more frequently (to eliminate incorrect readings). Unfortunately, after taking 4 or 5 readings, you can get 4 or 5 measurements that are all significantly different! Don't waste your time (and sanity) on this product."
3,Okay item,"Bought this for my husband and he felt it was just as easy using a regular tape measure as opposed to using the Strait-Line Laser Tape. I thought it would be a neat gift, guess I should have gotten a man's opinion first."
2,Unacceptable,"I understand that this tool is only for estimating, but even for that purpose it's unacceptable. Lots, maybe most of the time I simply get an ""error"" result; other times, on a distance I can visualize to be 10 or 12 feet, this device says ""3 foot"" or ""3 foot 2 inch"" (this seems to be a favorite false result, happens A LOT). Device won't work if you're close to a corner, won't work well on any irregular surface, and rounds to the nearest inch; no eighths, no quarters, nothing less than a full inch. All in all, I have no confidence in the results, and have switched back to a tape."
1,It's CRAP!,"Would give it 0 stars if I could. Yes it does measure but only to within an inch. i'm sorry but that isn't even close for making accurate cuts and if you cut short your really messed. Also it doesn't have a level bubble so if your not shooting real straight your length will be biased by the laser being out of level. Unless your only requirement is a ""best guess"" as to the length forget it."
1,Stunningly Inaccurate,"Never mind that the measurement readout only reads down to the nearest inch, the accuracy of this tape is simply mind-bogglingly bad.Examples: Several readings taken against a far wall varied from 14' to 22'. I repeatedly got an ""exact"" reading of 14' 8"" on a wall over 20 feet away, even while varying the distance to the target by several feet! Closer in, I get a 2' 9"" measurement on a target over 4 feet away.These are not occasional errors, they are continuous and render this 'tool' unusable.If the price were cheaper, this would make a great cat exerciser. Other than that, this product is completely useless."
2,DON'T KNOW,"I have this item on order and have only used it in the store. Found it to be accurate enough for my purposes - sq footage for paint, wallpaper, flooring etc. I am having the most problem with Amazon's list price of $59.02. I shopped extensively for this item and never saw it priced over $36.00. They make it seem that you are getting a very good buy when in fact you are paying exactly what it sells for at any store."
2,"NOT a laser measure, it's sonic!","The reason everyone is having such problems getting accurate results is that this isn't a laser measure at all. The laser is only a pointer to show where you're aiming, and as you know, you can get one of those at the dollar store. The measuring happens with the sonic clicker, essentially a sonar, which is extremely inaccurate. I keep mine around for difficult measurements that don't need to be perfect, like ceiling height. However, if you want a laser tape, you have to buy a REAL one. Leica's Distro is absolutely wonderful (I've done 600' measurements to within 1/4""), plus you can add a scope or put it on a tripod. They cost $300 and up, but they are well worth it to professionals. I hope to see consumer level units soon for under $100. I also hope someone stops Strait-Line from calling itself a laser!"
1,Extremely disappointing. Very inaccurate,"Wrong so often I have lost all my confidence in it and usually have to double check with a conventional tape. I have a 4ft 8in square window, which this ""laser"" tape repeatedly tells me is 2ft 10in x 4ft 10in. I measured it about 100 times to test th unit and it never gave me the horizontal reading correctly once, yet never made a mistake on the vertical one. Impossible to fathom how it could do that. Use it to ""impress the neighbors"", then use a conventional measuring tape when they are not looking. :o)"
1,Deceptive advertising,"This is not a ""Laser Tape"". It's an ultrasound distance estimator (based on the same wildly inaccurate echo technology used in those old Polaroid cameras) with a laser sight attached to it. And just like any ultrasound distance estimator, it's inaccurate to the point of being worthless. The laser is essentially a laser pointer slapped onto this contraption, apparently for no other purpose than to be able to print ""LASER TAPE"" on the packaging, misleading the unsuspecting customer into believing they were buying a laser tape. Not quite: it's an ultrasound ""tape"" with a laser attached to it. In other words, it's twenty bucks flushed down the toilet.Spend the money and get a proper tool such as the Stanley TLM11 FatMax. It's amazingly accurate and will really save you time and effort. Or, if you can't justify the expense, just stick to your old tape. You will get nothing but frustration from this ""Strait-Line"" piece of garbage."
2,Not accurate,"I am giving it two stars because it may be useful for rough estimates. However, it is a disappointment. I got it on sale (close-out, I think) and for interior walls it consistently reads about 5 inches longer than the actual dimension (properly measuring from base. I am sure I will occasionally bring it out of the toolbox for a quick rough measure, but that is about it. I'd return it if I could."
3,OK - But not great.,"Fighting with a tape in a room with lots of furniture can be very frustrating. Usually, a close estimate is all that your wanting. For roughs, in reasonably open spaces, this device works pretty well. However, sense it is ""sonic"", there are lots of variables. Where ever you have surfaces that reflect sound waves, you will get a reading. So, long, narrow hallways, cluttered rooms,etc., may give you ""Err"" readings or inaccurate readings. It seems that rooms with electronic ""clutter"", like big screen T.V.'s, may give you inaccurate readings. Therefore, you often have to use some common sense and realize that if the room is around 20 feet and your getting a reading of 10', it is wrong. At any rate, it is a useful device but not commercial grade. If you are looking for a high grade device, look somewhere else. As one reviewer stated, it's a shame that it is not a true laser device - that would be great."
5,Surprisingly Accurate,"I am not a professional, but I inspect houses on the side. Since I work alone alot, my wife bought me this hoping it would save me some time and get me home earlier! At first I was scepticle, but I was quickly impressed how accurate and easy it was to use. It has a laser that comes on when you press the measure button so you know exactly where the measurement is and you can figure square footage of rooms and put them into memory to quickly calculate the square footage of the whole house. I don't think it would be good for new construction because it needs something solid to ""bounce"" off of, but for the money, you can't go wrong. I would recomend this for anyone who does a lot of floor work, home improvements, estimating or realestate."
1,Oh Dear This was bad-bad-bad,What can I say exept this thing really needs more development. Sound waves seem to be very unpredictable. After almost screwing up an important carpet cut I decided I can't trust the straight line. I immediately returned the straight line. Now I'm shopping for a true Laser Range Finder.
2,"Not a bad remote, but such a pain to set up. WHERE ARE THE DRIVERS???","This remote can only be set up via a connection to your computer. Which would be fine, except that it needs drivers for Windows Vista to recognize it. Which would also be fine if the CD that came with it had the drivers on it, or you could download it from Sony's website.You can't do either.So now, I have a remote control that I can't program. So it can't recognize any of the new home theater components I bought. When I first programmed it (on Windows XP), it worked fine. SO I guess if you're one of the 3 people in America who still run XP, this remote would be great for you. Otherwise, look somewhere else."
1,WARNING!!!!!!!,This remote is not compatable with windows vista and no software upgrades avalable so if you are running windows vista dont waste your time and money.
4,Great product for the users that have a lot of devices to control.,"This is a great remote. It can control alomost everything. It even can control my Sirius Radio. Easy setup when you have the remotes and use the computer. The express feature is really nice. The only down sie is it take a little bit of time to set every thing up, but well worth the time."
2,This is a work in progress!!!,"The Sony RM AX1400 is a real dog to program. I am still working on my third reiteration of programming. It works okay if nothing gets out of sync, but it does get out of sync and you almost have to resort to the remotes you are trying to replace to get it working again. If you enjoy a real challange, this is it."
1,Bad feel,"I totally agree with the prior review about the bad feel of this remote. It is very wide in your hand and has sharp edges. The most frequently used buttons start to wear on you fingers as well.What I find is that the signal is fairly weak. So, you have to press each button multiple times and for a long time to get most devices to react well (and I have all Sony gear).The software did have a learning curve, but does work okay. The wizard that it takes you through is worthless. It needs you to fully define every button you may use in your lifetime upfront or it errors out and can not proceed. I finally added a bunch of fake information just to get around the stupid thing. Once you get to the actual application, it is fairly straightforward and you can set it up fine.Pros: not sure I have any yetCons: cumbersome feel, too wide and sharp, bad software wizardI would pass on this next time."
2,Un-ergonomic and somewhat inflexible,"Pros: Compuer interface, heavy (doesn't feel toylike), bright OLED display, well pricedCons: uncomfortable in your hand and cumbersome software.My main concerns with this remote are that it just doesn't fit well in my hand. Unlike the Sony RM-VL900 I was hoping it would replace. It's too wide to fit comfortably in my hand and has sharp features on the edges which can be uncomfortable.Unlike other learning remotes, it REQUIRES the use of a computer to set up he remote and the provided software is a bit cumbersome requiring two clicks and a remote key press for each keycode to be custom learned. Some devices were rcognized by the software and only required one or two keys to be properly identified."
2,almost a good deal?,"A very power and feature packed remote. I enjoy a challenge, but this remote is testing my limits. First of all I had to track down the web site and download the most recent software and firmware, otherwise it would not recognize 3 of my four remotes. I spent several hours trying different combinations and time delays for the express settings. The express buttons are supposed to turn on or off all components with one button push. Sometimes it works, but most of the time not. I may be able to spend some more time and tweak it to the point it may sort of work. It just doesn't have enough buttons to control all the features and options of the original remotes. I still have to pick up the original remote way too often. I does do the very basic operations of all the remotes I have programed. I didn't even check in to the Harmony remote because of the cost, but I am thinking now my time and frustration are worth quite a bit."
1,Too hard to program,"I purchased this remote because I needed one to control all my products, and because it was much cheaper then other remotes that did the same thing. I guess you get what you pay for. This remote is far too hard to program I made a mistake going through the program and I can not figure out how to go back. It will NOT control 2-3-4 things with one button, and you can not delete any comands or start over again. I will dump this in the box of unused remotes I was trying to replace when I brought this, and keep looking. I definity do not recomend this product."
2,"Stymied, but hopeful","I bought this item last night and tried to program it and it's a nightmare. The software is more difficult to use than Logitech's. I was going to return it tonight after work by the Philips touch screen model, but no one sells it around me. Anyway, I called Sony Tech SUpport and they assured me that they can help me this evening over the phone. Also, Chrisell's review is just about the most helpful review I've ever seen posted anywhere about anything. Even if Sony can't help me, Chrisell provided enough information that I think I can get it working. I'll post again after I see what happens tonight."
4,"Good, for the price","This remote is a great deal, but it's not perfect. As noted in other reviews, it is very customizable but the software interface is pretty clunky. The remote has a tendency to forget what state your devices are in. For example, you should be able to switch from watching a DVD to watching TV with a single button push. The idea is that it knows what components are on and what inputs they are set for so it will switch the receiver to TV, turn off the DVD player, and switch the TV input to ""TV"". However, the remote often forgets to switch the TV input from ""VIDEO"" to ""TV."" There is a ""Sync-up"" button which goes through each component and tells you to set it properly, but then it still doesn't remember that the TV is now using the input ""TV"" and when you switch back to the DVD player it won't flip the input to ""VIDEO"". This is annoying, but overall the remote is a time saver and works pretty well. For under $20 (shipped), you can't beat it."
2,"Cannot ""teach"" signal!",I could not find a data for Go DVD/Video Recorder and none for cable company's hard dirve recorder. I tried teaching functions but does not have that function other than set data.
2,Subpar performance at an OK price,"I generally agree with the previous reviews on this item...Pros:- Bright OLED- Decent price- With time, becomes easier to useCons:- Software interface is cumbersome to use (I recommend laptop in room with your home theater devices when you program)- Signal is relatively weak (need to point remote directly at device)- Not comfortable to hold in hand (although I don't hold a remote for long periods of time)- My wife and son won't have anything to do with it!I probably would pass on this if I was to purchase again."
1,Add one more remote to your Junk Remote Box,"I am used to punching in a code for each device, and you're done. Really, what's wrong with that? This unit does not recognize any DVD players made by OPPO, the best players available. It also did not recognize my PHILLIPS Directv remote. It recognized my Hitachi TV but only off and on, vol up and down and mute. I upgraded to new Sony software, but still no luck. How many hours do you have to waste? Obviously, the reason it sells for [...] bucks is that its not worth anything. Followup: I tried to program each button, the way the 5 star reviewers suggested, but this only works 75% of the time. What good is a remote if the ""4"" and ""7"" and many other buttons don't work? That's the same issue with my BROKEN remotes! By 1 star, I really mean ZERO STARS!"
3,Would have been nice to know this for Windows ONLY,As I said above it would be nice if they told you this only works withWindows. As I ONLY use Macs it very disappointing. Having to look for someone who uses Windows.
5,Audio Technica Stylus,Very good my old one lasted about 4 or 5 years before I felt it needed to be replaced . Now my vinyl sounds more crisp than ever good price and good quality for a inexpensive stylus!
4,Great affordable replacement for ION T-USB Turntable,"This needle has a really good quality for being only a little over ten buckaroos! The sound is not exaggerated at all and has a really deep and natural sound. The HIGHS are not harsh at all and are nicely laid back, but not weak! The MIDS are very appropriately present and don't go overboard, and have a very natural and warm tone. The LOWS seem to be nice and solid, but can tend to be a slight bit muddy/overpowered sometimes, but can be tweaked easily with the BASS and TREBLE controls on your stereo receiver amp. Overall, this is a product that I would definitely recommend to those who are looking for a cheap but quality made replacement needle for their turntable!"
4,"As described, good value",This replacment stylus is as described for a good price. It was easy to install and does a good job for a low end stylus.
4,"Fine Sony replacement, clear sound.","I wasn't sure what to expect after reading some reviews that mentioned that this is not a genuine Audio Technica product. But, the product arrived matching the photos, and matched the factory stylus on my Sony PS-LX350H.I agree with others that this is a perfectly suitable replacement stylus for a Sony turntable. On noisy records or quiet records alike, the sound is clear; tested on clean records, no undue noise or problems. Fine product, already excited to play records until the next time to change it!"
1,Bad Manufacturing,"First one had one of the two stereo pins missing. A new one was sent for free, I suppose that would be considered a plus, but the new one arrived with a bent stylus.I never try to leave bad feedback but I would suggest that maybe you pay a little more (like I will) and choose a local vendor so you can see what you're getting."
3,Standard stylus,"The records I play are too old for this review to be of much use. It works though, from a certain point of view. Reviews for the Audio Technica were that it transferred to digital well."
3,Decent Sony replacement,"After reading several reviews, I decided to try this out as a much cheaper alternative to the SONY PS-LX250H replacement needle. After reminiscing all night with my Blondie, Bowie, and Beatles albums, I can say it sounds pretty good, but as one reviewer pointed out, it has no needle protection bar--This means you need to be careful, but it also means the arm is lighter, so mine has been bouncing more than it used to. I have yet to figure out how to compensate for this.On really clean records, it's no problem. But some of the older stuff is skipping more than with the previous needle. (Also, when it arrived, it did not look like the product image: it was bright yellow with no emblem.)As far as the shipment goes, it was fast and moderately-well packaged."
4,Good deal on a good CD,"Been after this CD for a while now and finally got it at a price I wanted to pay. Arrived as advertised, quick delivery, overall a very good deal."
1,disappointed,"Neither one of the two decks I bought would work at all. I had bought an earlier version of the Daewoo deck a few months ago, which work ok, but these wouldnt even turn on after charging all night long. Returned both of them for a refund."
1,Shouldn't have bought it,"This looked like a good thing. Tape player, dvd player, use it in you car with tape hookup, rechargeable batteries. The instructions are not very clear, had to look for english. Switching from on to charge is a bit confusing. If you don't do it exactly right, the batteries don't charge. The tape connection for the car system does not work at all, which is why I bought it. It is hard to change a disk with one hand too! The sound is good but not alot of volume with headphones."
1,Different,"Item I ordered seemed very nice online and priced right. However, once I received it...thei item was of poor quality and incorrect which model amazon sent.This was my first expereience buying a watch online, never again....better to goto the watch counter and review the item in person."
5,Very Impressive Bag!,"I can't adequately express how pleased I am with this bag. It's well-made, has lots of room and pockets - now they're adding a Stanley tape measure to go with it - all for under $15!! I just ordered 4 more sets for Christmas presents."
2,Don't use for airline travel,"I bought this bag primarily to carry a 20-inch plastic tool box with scientific instruments to work sites via checked plane baggage. It has not held up well, considering how light the cargo has been. The very thin plywood bottom has broken into a million pieces and created quite a mess. The velcro on the handles is now useless. And the edge wear trim pieces all got pulled out of the fabric so they hang out and just catch on things. I guess this bag has been on probably ten round trips. I expected it to last a lot longer than it did. How this translates to tool storage on a jobsite I am not sure, but it should be predictive overall."
3,"Too big, too bad.","This is a quality cargo bag but it is larger than what I was expecting. I wanted to purchase a bag to transport a few necessary tools in the trunk of my car. For that task, it's too big. Otherwise, it is a real nice tool bag with plenty of pockets, sturdy handles with a durable material. Probably more appropriate for someone using for a professional purpose."
3,"great content, miserable interface","I've used the Accordance program for almost a year now. It does have a great selection of content but you can't seem find one package that has everything you need. I guess that's a good marketing ploy to sell more product but it drives the consumer mad (drives me mad anyway). Sadly, the biggest problem I've had with the program is the user interface. Trying to use the program feels about as frustrating as trying to back a double trailer up a winding mountain road. If the user interface was rebuilt to be user friendly, logical and clean then I would be a much happier man while using this program. That being said, it is still usable and after lots of time and effort you can figure out where things are at and make it play ball with you."
2,Easy to fight with,"I have had this program for over a year and well . I hate it, I changed over to Mac and this was the ""be all to end all"". Everything you need is in a different bundle which is a pain to try to find which bundle you need and if you have it with some other bundle you have already boughtThe institution DVD ( I paid extra for) keeps saying how easy it is to use BUT I am always fighting with it ALWAYS, The DVD on how to learn the program is different then the windows they use on the version on my computer NUTS! What am I to do? I spent the hundreds hoping tI would live up to the hype. I have at time just skipped using the program and just used google for what I was looking for as I did not want the extra stress of fighting with the program yet again"
2,Not completly satisfied,"I thought the DVD would go more in depth into the life of Louis Delgado; however, that is not the case. I was expecting to hear some interviews from Louis Delgado and see some well detailed fights. Instead, all the DVD contains are few short clips from his early fights and a lengthy class that is filmed in his studio showing him teaching his black belt students. Not only does the image quality is somehow grainy and not very clear, the class is what the entire DVD is about basically (at least 97% of the DVD focus on that while the remaining 3% are just few clips of his fights).I am somehow disappointed because I did not know who Louis Delgado was before, and I still do not know who he really is and what he has become. It would have been nice to have included in the DVD interviews from the like of Joe Lewis or even Chuck Norris. I give it 2 stars because I think the DVD could have had more information on Louis, more interviews, and more in depth fights."
4,I WILL GO DOWN WITH THIS SHIP....,"White Falg is another of those lyric driven songs, that don't failed to entertaint the audience, the story of unconditional love is represented here, with simple voice, and simple music arragenments, great tune and a great sophomore start for her new album, the extra track it's ok, and the mix is only neccesary but not an essential."
5,One of the best,This song is really one of a kind... done with so much of talent and feeling. Many thanks to Dido for this song... can't say in words how much I love this song.
5,I owe Dr. Rubin for much of the joy I have gotten from life.,"It was like magic that so much of what Dr. Rubin writes in Compassion and Self-Hate hit home with me. I can only say he set me free--from my past, myself and my life as it was. The book enabled me to embrace what life could be, but further influenced how I dealt with the children in my life so they would not be the afraid, nonfunctioning person I had been."
5,Compassion and Self-Hate is brilliant,"I went through a very destructive period of self-hate many years ago; somehow I managed to survive and even cure myself. I can validate what Rubin writes from my own personal experience. It is a brilliant and very helpful book, and it is well-written--that's not always the case with a book by an M.D. or a psychologist.I cannot recommend this book highly enough--and I really believe that everyone should read it."
4,She's alive and she's a total whore,"I think it's fair to assume Mary Shelley had no idea her epic novel would spawn a parody that would be anything like FRANKENHOOKER. This 1990 black comedy cult-trash is about a Jersey mad scientist (Lorinz) who uses the body parts of 42nd St crackwhores to bring back his wife (once Penthouse pet Patty Mullen), recently deceased in a lawn mower mishap. When the electricity strikes and the hooker awakes, across the river to Times Square she goes on the prowl for doomed johns. Raunchy and as silly-as-it-gets, folks with more mainstream tastes will scratch their heads. But if you're a fan of trash cinema and cult films FRANKENHOOKER is kinda like cookie-dough ice cream. One must be a fool not to see the social commentary regarding the crack epidemic which was in full swing when this was made. FYI Blu-Ray features are a real plus."
1,Big disappointment,"I have always enjoyed Trillin's books but with this one, he has not delivered his usual wit and advice. His poorest work to date and I hope he will do better in future writings. Much of this book is essentially what he has had to say in previous volumes but delivered in an almost bland way. First time readers of Trillin may like it but they should look to some of his earlier books."
2,Del Castillo is Chingon,"to paraphrase Mr. Rodriquez, thatis.check out the real thing by looking into Del Castillo's music.The one cut on this and few cuts on other soundtracks do not touch their music.They will be big, and Texas will miss them......"
4,Info about the a-j-p-3 review,"I'm really interested to find the song a-j-p-3 talks about, please help me. Do somebody know how can i have it?a-j-p-3 any ideas??? Thanks to everyone"
3,Missing Songs all over the place!!!,"ok, the soundtrack is great, but there are two important peices of music that are missing. The Scenes with Budd outside of his trailer, and the end when Bill is killed. Those are my two favorites from the movie, and they are not on here!!!But I do love the peice of music ""L'Arena""...when the Bride is punching her way through the coffin. It gives you such a sense of victory.The picture of Quentin and Uma on the back of the CD is really sweet too."
4,Missing Track,"does anybody know the name of the song that we hear when Budd talk to Elle, the moment after he shot her?"
3,What's that one song..,What is the song that's playing when The Bride and her daughter are laying on the bed watching that movie? Does anyone know? Someone has to know!
2,A Tamer & Softer Disk That Doesn't Come Close to Vol. 1,"I loved the movies, and thought the soundtrack to Volume 1 of Kill Bill was fantastic. I eagerly snapped up Vol. 2, and was very upset to find it paled in comparison to Volume 1. Vol. 2 features more of a Southwestern/Latino sound that seems more down tempo and much more reserved than the first soundtrack. I won't bother going thru the individual songs, because to be honest, they left so little of an impression I doubt I could tell you much. The only reason I gave this album any stars was for the fantastic bits of dialogue which are included and David Carridine's telling the Legend of Pei Mei which were enjoyable. But I wouldn't spend over $5 for this disk unless you are just such a huge fan of the movie you need something to tide you over until the DVD comes out. Or better yet, hopefully they will put out a double CD with both soundtracks as well as bonus cuts?! Great movie, sub-standard soundtrack for Volume 2."
4,"Amazing, But Not Perfect","Great soundtrack, great music selection. Just amazing, but unlike the first one, it has more of a southwestern flair and a spaghetti western feel. You won't find the techno or the high energy music at all, BUT if you loved the music from the movie, get this album."
3,missing songs spoilt it for me,"i too wish i had been more careful and read the reviews, then i would have noticed all the missings songs and that the main one i wanted ( navajo joe - ennio morricone --bills exit ) was not on there. i still would have bought it but would not have been so dissapointed when i got to the end. i also feel very cheated.what is the point of bringing out a soundtrack and missing out songs? should it not be all of them?i feel bills exit music was a key song that should not have been missed off, as this scene is the whole point of the films, when she finally gets her revenge and should not have been missed.worth buying but a dissapointment"
3,Nice but....,"Malcolm McLaren has a knack for blending different music styles to produce some ethereal music. However, was disappointed that Malcolm took a song called 'She's not there' that was written by Rod Argent and recorded by several artists, notably the Zombies and essentially used it (and it sounds like Colin Blunstone singing) without any reference. It doesn't show Rod Argent as the writer but Malcolm McLaren. I am sure royalties were paid but disappointed such a great song as 'She's not there' was renamed and reclaimed by Malcolm"
3,"This CD was OK, not great.","I found this CD to be OK, but not really impressed with it after I got it. I would not recommend this CD."
4,Good Soundtrack,"Although I must admit that I really like the KILL BILL VOL.1 (Kill Bill: Volume 1) soundtrack, this compilation narrowly edges that one out. They dispensed this time of including sound effects like in the previous one and there are some really standout tunes (Malaguena Salerosa, Urami Bushi and L'Arena come to mind).The mood and tempo on this soundtrack is much more somber and slow than the other one, but all in all a better compilation."
4,Tarantino theme music,"Every time I play this CD it brings back memories of scenes from the movie. But unlike watching the DVD, when I play it in my car the sound surrounds me so it definitely feels like theme music. Good stuff to cruise to on the open road."
4,Kill Bill Rocks,"Excellent recordings, no flaws in the CD, and there are songs I did not remember. It has sound effects as well - I must find a use for them. Not enough of the 5, 6, 7, 8's though, but I'd still buy it."
4,Good soundtrack!,"Big fan of the movie! I feel this is a pretty complete collection of the songs. Everything I wanted is here. Including ""Goodnight Moon"", ""Tu Mira"", ""About Her"" (which is the main reason I bought it), ""Malaguena"", and ""Irumi Bushim"""
5,Answer to a frequent question,"A lot of people here were asking about the song that plays while Bill is talking to Budd is his trailer. That song, which does not appear on the soundtrack, is ""Dies Irae"" by composer Nora Orlandi. The song originally appeared in the 1972 Edwige Fenech giallo titled 'The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh'. It can be found on a CD compilation of Nora Orlandi and Alessandro Alessandroni called 'Music for Strange Situations'.Hope that helps! It's a gorgeous song!"
3,two isn't always better,"Kill Bill Volume one was amazing soundtrack. However volume two of the movie and the soundtrack is closure to this epic as Godfather three was. I suggest you get volume two for only two good reasons...One, completing the set if you have volume one and two, if you are a fan of tex/mex styled tunes and Morricone music combined with three camp dialog bits from the movie.(what missing is Darryl Hanna's Snake speech) The soundtrack seem thread bare when compared to music of the first Bill Soundtrack.However there is a great piece in Good Night Moon, a waling somber piece which ran over the final credits in the movie.On the whole, if you liked being complete, get the Bill. If not, just leave leave this BILL dead!=Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
4,Response to 'A Music Fan',"The song you're looking for is ""About Her,"" as remixed by Malcolm McLaren."
3,A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED...,"I was a little dissapointed with the second volume (I have both 1 & 2). There are a few diamonds in the rough, but overall, the first volume was much better. Only buy the second volume if you absolutely must have it for your collection-if you can do without, save your dough."
3,anyone know the name of the 2nd song in the trailer?,Its the song after summertime killer on the trailer thats being played when they are nailing the coffin closed. anyone know it or if its on the cd?
3,Two Words --- Mildly Disappointed,"Couldn't wait for the movie to come out, I want to sample the vol.2 soundtrack at first hand. Without watching the movie, this soundtrack seems abit disappointed if comparing to the first one --- Kill Bill Vol.1. Firstly, the obvious thing is the varieties of the songs & music in this soundtrack are great but none of them are actually able to drive the audiences to a certain level of feeling, emotion, tone, and atmosphere. Most of them are quite slow and mid pace. None are especially impressive. Secondly, it contains too much talking tracks from the Bride and particularly Bill. Thirdly, unlike the previous soundtrack (Kill Bill vol.1), this vol.2 CD soundtrack does not come with any bonus freebies such as movie clips or trailers.Overall, I feel disappointed but still recommend buying if you are one of the true fan of the Kill Bill series. Otherwise, go watching the movie, then decide."
4,"Introspective, character driven, like the film","I bought this CD just for the tune ""About Her"", which is a smooth, stylish, contemporary nod to a classic track, just like this fantastic movie pays tribute to its inspirations. This tune, played during a pivotal sequence between The Bride and Bill, takes the action down a notch, adding a fresh dimension to the vengeance machine. The Ennio Morricone tracks are a bonus, especially for those raised on spaghetti westerns.True, it does not have all the variances that the Kill Bill Vol. 1 album has, but then they are two different films are they not? In the same way that one can regard Full Metal Jacket as one movie with two distinct halves, one should think the same of these Volumes. As such, the music reflects the unique vision of each piece."
5,Desert Dirt,"The track where the Bride has escaped the coffin and is trudging along, dirt-covered, through the desert, is--I believe--Bernard Girard Christophe's ""The Sunny Road to Salina."" The track was recognized by fans in some of the earlier trailers and an mp3 was posted at one of the Kill Bill sites I frequent. I really liked the track and was keeping an ear open for it while I watched the movie. Excellent placement."
3,Another song missing from the soundtrack,"Another song that is missing from this soundtrack is ""Sweet the Sting"" by Tori Amos. This is playing in the very end of the movie as Uma is driving down the road in the convertible."
3,Soundtrack Incomplete (Missing Good Songs),"I wish I would have read the review that lists the missing songs (and their descriptions). I still would have purchased the CD, -it's good, but at least I wouldn't have been disappointed, waiting needlessly for some of my favorite tracks. Isn't a soundtrack supposed to include all of the songs? I FEEL CHEATED."
3,Ah Ah Ah Ah,This Cd does not have everything on it from kill bill 2 that I wanted. A few songs and the bride training with pai mei hitting wooded wall sayingah ah ah ah. So there for I was somewhat dissapoint with this cd.
4,Missing Music,I think the soundtrack is a fresh sound to the same story. The First Soundtrack from Kill Bill Vol.1 fitted the story to give for flavor to this amazing film. In Kill Bill Vol.2 a song that is not on the credit listings is my focus. In the coffin scene The Bride recalls the pai mei punch technic. After gaining composer the brides focus on escape is met with a spanish trumphet slow at first and then met with a orchestra. I would love to Know the name of the composer and the title of the song. The Music serves as a motivator. Every time I hear this song I get Pumped and excited. If any one knows please comment. THANK YOU
5,HELP ONCE AGAIN,"i have almost everything that I've been looking for. except one. this score that is played when Bill iis talking to Bride in the church when she asks him ""Do I look pretty?"". if anyone know what is it please help."
3,not as good as...,"the leclaire method is a little more complete, but this is a good book to read. it's got the basic information to get you started."
5,Scriptural Guidance for Youth and Adults,"The Bible Promise Book is a wonderful resource for Christian Youth and Adults. The Table of Contents lists common concerns, such as fear, worry, anxiety, comfort, forgiveness, loneliness, guilt, help in troubles and many others. Scriptures from both the Old and New Testaments can be quickly found by turning to the pages indicated in the Contents. This small, attractive paperback book is a ready resource for the Christian seeking God's answers to their particular situation. I like to give this book as a gift to graduating Seniors as they begin their adult life. I also present it to Junior and Senior High School students in my Sunday School class."
5,Wonderful Book,This book is a wonderful source of daily Biblical inspiration. This book was given to me by my parents and I now have given copies as gifts to friends.
1,Wrong translation,"The NIV is not translated from the correct manuscripts. Therefore, it is not God's Holy Word, and it contains many contradictions, errors, and straight out blasphemous material. For the truth in God's Word, you must read the King James Version!! you can contact me if you would like to discuss this at:Buzulak@hotmail.com"
4,Good Japanese language practice for Gen Y,"I listen to Japanese pop music for the Japanese language practice. This is not my favorite music in the genre (not quite trippy enough) but I'm actually buying a second copy to give to my college-age daughter, who's also studying Japanese. Sound is pretty close to American groups, like Destiny's Child, that she seems to like, so I think she would enjoy a copy also. Like I said, not quite enough hook to the music to interest me (I much prefer Hamasaki Ayumi and Nav Katze) but I think it is good party dance music."
4,"Better than First Love, but not as good as Deep River","I deeply love Utada Hikaru and think this is a really good album, but it really pales in comparison to Deep River. It does have a much better track selection than First Love and her voice sounds slightly better, but sometimes it seems all over the place to me. She can reach the high notes, but it sounds like a strain. The bad songs are Sunglass, For You, and Kotoba ni Narenai Kimochi as they were neither fast nor slow and were just a snoozefest. The bonus track also seems pointless to me. The good songs (all the rest) are very good, so they mostly make up for it."
5,One of the best albums of 2001,"Hikaru Utada is a super star in Japan. After listening to her albums I can see why. I was first introduced to Hikaru with her debut album FIRST LOVE. Although FIRST LOVE was a classic and it sold over 8 million copies, DISTANCE is even better! First of all, Hikaru Utada writes her own lyrics, which is similar to poetry. The music on DISTANCE is a mix of R&B/pop and rock. Hikaru sings with pure emotion and the songs will hook you in at first listen. You don't need to speak japanese to enjoy this music. It's one of those albums that you can play over and over. DISTANCE begins with ""wait & see"", an awesome upbeat song, and ends with an amazing remix of ""hayatochi"". Tracks like ""distance"" and ""eternally"" are sweet, daydreamy ballads that will make you melt. DISTANCE showcases Hikaru Utada as being a super talented artist."
4,Distance,"I got Hikki's first CD and it's awesome too. I like this one better, I don't really like""Can you Keep A Secret"". ""Eternally"" is my favorite song."
1,Horrible... so very horrible,"There are so many talented Japanese artists out there, why do so many people worship Utada? She has a horrible voice and even worse, she throws English words into Japanese songs. As if the song is for the opening of anime tv show. Look around, there are Japanese singers with actual talent. Her CDs are just hype."
5,Northern Exposure - The Complete Series,Product was exactly what I was looking for. Packaging is unique and creative. Great gift idea!
1,Hold Out for the Whole Experience,Like many have posted before me. I loved this show and it would be nice to have the WHOLE series but without ALL the original music it is NOT the same show and you are NOT getting the WHOLE Experience. I just can't bring myself to watch the DVDs as they have been packaged...I prefer watching the few espisodes I have on VHS with the original music rather than the pale imitation they have produced on this DVD set.
1,Still Not The Original Series. No Original Music = Dealbreaker,"Those who watched and loved NX on TV know how integral the music was to the story. Each episode came with music as unique and endearing as the writing. These DVDs are but a mere shadow of the original production.When I heard about this re-release box set of the entire series, I got excited . . . until I learned nothing had changed with the audio.I can't imagine the royalty situation would be so difficult to fix, but at this late date I doubt anyone will ever release the true originals in DVD format. For me, these DVDs might as well have been overdubbed in Chinese."
1,The Complete Series Isn't Complete,"I have Seasons 1 & 2. I didn't buy the rest of the seasons because I was looking forward to, for a number of years, now, the complete series of this fabulously creative and quirky show to be released. When I heard it was finally available, I promptly logged-on to Amazon with excitement. I was just about to buy it..that is, until I read the reviews explaining that the original music is missing and the producers of this ""complete series"" botched-up this set. The original music is an entity in, and of itself; it's a huge part of the show. Why would they omit it? Money? Are you kidding?? Well....I've decided not to buy the set. Hopefully, after reading these reviews, the creators of the ""complete series"" might want to rethink it and re-release the true Northern Exposure as it should be. What a disgrace to one of the best shows, ever, to air on TV."
1,No music? Shameful.,"The CD soundtracks don't cut it, Universal. Put the music back where it belongs if you want people to buy this. Sure, you've fooled plenty of people and are probably lining your pockets with your pitifully earned cash, but take a look at the three most helpful reviews featured on this product's main page.This classic show deserves a release filled with all the creators' original ideas, not the studio's idiotic penny-saving trickery. You can't fool the fans. We will pay you when what you try selling us is actually worth our money. Until then, enjoy the unsold backstock."
2,Original Music Missing,"It's unbelievable that this set would be created without the original music! I watched this show regularly in the nineties and the music was the soul of the show. Do it again, creators, and do it right!"
1,Glad I read the reviews on this one!!,"As most Northern Exposure fans, I've been waiting to order the complete series, excited about what extra's there would be, etc. I finally got to a place where I had the money to order it, hopped on Amazon and got my hopes up. Soon they were dashed reading the reviews. NOT THE ORIGINAL MUSIC??? How can you release Northern Exposure episodes without the music that made the show?? I'm SO glad I read the reviews before dumping down so much money. It appears there are no extra's to speak of either. what a shame. I'm so disappointed. I was so looking forward to this. I hope the distributor reads these reviews and will release a real version."
2,not original?,"wow I was set to buy this, but without the original music I can't see a reason to and like others will stick with my incomplete but much loved tapes. I really appreciated the reviews that pointed this deficit out, it's such a great show why would it not be put out intact? It is such a perfect piece of TV I can't see owning something less than what it originally was.One day perhaps this will be remedied in which case it will be well worth waiting for.I guess if you had not watched it at the time you might think you still have something special and indeed the stories and characters are great, but if you bought say a DVD set of the Prisoner series and the music was dubbed with synths instead of it's orchestral score you'd feel cheated, the music was an integral emotional character of NE and any substitution is a real shame."
1,Disappointed,"I loved this show!!! The 1 star is for the DVD release and not for the show itself. I, like so many others, hate it when a much loved television show or movie is released without the original music or concept. The companies that release these shows should know that in this day and time so many customers LOVE the music in shows enough that they have made song lists on their websites for fans to retrieve the names. Music can elevate a scene so much and bring forth so much more emotion from the viewer. Why would the original music not be on the DVDs. Don't release movies or television series unless you can do so in a way to preserve what the fans loved about the show enough to want to purchase it. I'm grateful that customers can write reviews and warnings so people that are looking to purchase an item will be warned before they purchase it and are HIGHLY disappointed!!"
2,Why Did They Do That?,"Northern Exposure was the greatest show of its kind ever on commercial television; it was a superbly fine integration of plot, character, story, and music. Take away any of those, and it's not what it was, or should be. The producers of this collection have DESTROYED IT by replacing the excellent original music with absolute rubbish. Shame. Don't buy this collection, your disappointment will hurt forever.I suspect it was done to save (read: make more) money. I'd have gladly paid the extra three dollars to keep this series as it was.Shame, shame, and eternal shame."
1,No music = No sale.,"I've been watching this (from Netflix) with my spouse & it's just not the same without the music. I actually noticed finally in one particular one. I believe when Chris is launching the piano with the catapult (IIRC) it was playing the song ""Frankenstein"". This was so very memorable that it wasn't the same."
1,soooo disappointed,Does anyone think anybody in Hollywood is actually paying attentionto these negative reviews? It sure would be nice if the music industryand their @#! royalties would lighten up. I really wanted to surprise my elderlyfather with this series (not to mention I liked it myself - and - the company I used towork for supplied all the crow (or raven) decoys NEX once used in a Christmas show.)and now I'm afraid we'll never see it again. And now I know why Ally McBeal andWKRP isn't on syndication either. What a drag. Wish I knew how to get bootlegs.....
4,Northern Exposure,I recently purchased the complete set of Northern Exposure DVD's! I didn't realize how much I appreciated and loved this show even though it was 20 years ago until I watched the pilot for the first time after a long hiatus! This is truely great television from the writing to the beloved characters!!Northern Exposure - The Complete Series
5,It all there in a cool case,"Nothing like watching a TV series with NO COMMERCIALS. The case is like a sheepskin. Gives it padding-not that it is needed, but at least it keeps all the DVD's in one place. Helped me keep the DVD's in my desired order so I could know where I left off. Good quality DVD's - no skipping, good volume."
4,Enjoyable,"Very entertaining for me. I am not familiar with the series when it was aired in the 90's, so the music that everybody is stressing about not being there doesn't really bother me. I would never have know if I didn't read the other reviews!"
1,Thank goodness for reviews...,"It's so hard to find quality television programming these days. We have only recently begun purchasing highly rated TV series on DVDs. Northern Exposure has been praised by many but, after reading these reviews, will pass on this one. What a shame.If the series is ever released with the original soundtrack I hope it is clearly advertised as such. Imagine Crossing Jordan sans the music... I won't even give this one a try."
1,glad I read this first!,"I am so glad I read these statements before I put this in my cart, I cant believe they would change anything from the original brodcast, the music is part of what carried the show along and made it so enchanting. Too bad for them they will not get my money for this waste of time. And thankyou to all of you who took the time to let the rest of us know."
1,Why Not Just Relay All the Dialogue as Well?,"The music was integral to the heart of the series. Change the music, change the show. What can we do? Write a review. Send a message."
1,Disappointment,"I have been waiting since the first set was released and it looks like I will wait until I find a set someone made from TV recordings. How could I buy Northern Exposure after having it introduce me to the likes of Etta James, Miriam Makeba, and Joanne Shenandoah? Buy it if you enjoyed the acting but for me the variety of the music made the show. I am also waiting for Much More Music from Northern Exposure.Paul"
5,Northern Exposure,This is great watching on a night when there is nohing good on t.vI bought the whole serries.
3,"Show is great, the music...","Part of the appeal of the original show was the great music soundtrack. It really captured the environemtn and emotion on screen nicely. I hear that in this set, and most US releases of the show, the original soundtrack has been replaced with elevator like music. Can anyone verify this? It would really be a huge disappointment (but something that has been done to countless classic TV shows upon DVD release)."
5,Superb!,I ordered the Northern Exposure Series for my husband. He loved the series before and I know he'll love seeing them again when he gets them for his birthday. Thanks for the quick service.
4,was very pleased,I bought this for my husband and we were very pleased with the movies.It has been awhile since we seen the shows so the music is not that big of a deal. He is pleased with the picture and sound qualities thank you.
5,Northern Exposure complete series in shearling shoulder pack,"I never saw complete series but found those I did charming. Visits to theoffbeat denizens of Cicely Alaska , whenever I feel like it during long, dark Northeasters , are a warm, nostalgic treat. The shearling shoulder packis fun storage feature and fits with the essence of the show. Enjoyingseeing old ""friends"". Great idea for old diehard fans."
5,This is one of the greatest shows ever written for TV.,"I never got into it as a kid when it was actually on, but sometime after college it captured my imagination. Sort of a Zen voyage across America in one little frozen town at the tip of the continent. If you love Americana that's not treated with sap of WB line up, has genuinely good (and mostly unpretentious) writing, you'll probably love NE. It really is a little bit of everything, the only problem is that it is 110 episodes and like my friend put it if you watch one a night thats over three months right there. Still it's a great set. Enjoy."
3,"For a newbie, is the missing music going to mean much?","3 Stars - Upgrade to 5 if the show is worth while. Everyone loves the show, but, if you're a newbie that's never seen the show, is the music really going to make a difference, if everything else is like 100%? Therefore, if I'm not missing the music, would this be a great buy?"
1,"Finally the original music, or no?","The previous releases on DVD of this series had much of the original music from the broadcast version replaced by generic dreck. Since the music was such a central character in the show, this is a real butcher-job, changing the feel and meaning of the show.I understand that it's expensive to get the rights to the music but don't understand why the producers would spend the money on tacky packaging instead of releasing the series in unmangled form.If this complete series DVD set has the original music restored then I will buy it. Otherwise I'll stick to the complete set of Hi-8 tapes that I recorded of the original broadcasts, and I will continue to be saddened that one of my favorite series is treated so shoddily. . ."
1,Bring back the right music,This was the greatest show ever made. I have waited 10 years to be able to buy a complete set of episodes and here we get some dubbed music nonsense that not only is horrible but ruins the episodes like scribbling on a Rembrandt with a crayon. Too bad guess i'll just have to keep waiting.
1,"Oh no, WTF?","I just gave away a whole bunch of junk to charity, including a virtually-complete set of S-VHS recordings of every season of this show, didn't even think about it, just figured, ""Well, of course I'm going to buy the whole series"" and only just now bothered to check the reviews before making my purchase. Well, at least I didn't wait until after making my purchase. I can't *believe* they didn't include all of the original music. Geez, guys, I'd have paid double the price for, you know, the actual shows."
1,Buyer Beware,"This set does not include the original music from the show. Frankly, it's not worth owning at any price."
1,Greedy Hollywood Killed Something Great,"Just as they killed the series for fear of it interfering with their social engineering and big picture expense bugets/profit margins- Top Level Hollywood Producers again disappoint the masses to make more money.They offer this butchered load of crap for a quick buck... All the musicians who contributed so much will not get their fair share, even though they helped establish its success..""Those"" types in Hollywood are SOOOO Greedy!Yet they whine, and wonder why people use torrents- when they don't even offer the originals that we can buy!I'm surprised they didn't re-edit it all to make all of the townspeople in Cicely all greedy & mean, with Joel the hero (Like they did in the first half of the last season before killing it off)They probably tried..Those in the industry know what social engineering type stuff I'm talking about...THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WILL STEAL IT, THEY DON'T EVEN OFFER THE REAL THING!"
5,DON JOSE' S DREAM,"Back in 1875, a man named Georges Bizet died leavingus an opera. However the credit does not fully be-long to him.It rightfully belongs to ProsperMerimee, whose imagination gave birth to a gypsycalled Carmen and her distressed lover Don Jose.Carmen, though her name is the title of the book,is not the most important character of the book.In this case Don Jose is the attention getter be-cause of his mental and moral makeup.Just as Don Quixote fantasized about Dulcinea,so Don Jose fantasizes about Carmen. Don Joseis a dreamer. Reality hits him in the headonly when Carmen chooses a career of smugglingand murdering for him.Don Jose is weak, nomatter what he can't say no to Carmen. Wecan't help but to pity him and say""If only we could send you to a physcologist....""Don Jose and Carmen are crazy,insane,andimmoral, much like people today."
3,Tends to the Commercial Side of LA,"I ordered this video and two other travel guides to help plan my seven day trip to LA. The video is interesting to watch but it focuses too much on the commercial attractions and much less on the many cultural attractions of this great city. If you need info on Universal Studios, Knott's Berry Farm, the Queen Mary and trendy shopping areas then this video may be for you. If you want to learn about the Getty Museum, LA Museum of Contempory Art and the great architectural masterpieces in LA then purchase ""Top Ten Los Angeles"". It includes so much more than this video."
2,Ho-hum,"Fair-to-middling outing from the usually reliable Ed McBain. A serial rapist and a serial killer are plaguing Isola, and the crew from the 87th is on top of it all. But there's too much emphasis on the ""procedural"" aspect of the story, and not enough on story-progression. The title ""Lightning"" has nothing to do with storms or electricity, and you don't learn its significance until abo0ut 265 pages in (and my copy is 312 pages long). For all their strengths, the cops don't have suspects (or even a suspicion) until the last 50 pages or so.On the other hand, he does manage to sneak in an ""Evan Hunter"" joke."
3,Kindle Version needed more care,"Average for Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series -- but average is still pretty good. I enjoyed the interweaving of the two main plot lines. But the Kindle edition could have been edited better to make it easier to read. There are numerous typos, but the most aggravating thing is the lack of any kind of break for most of the scene shifts. A blank line or two would make reading the book a whole lot easier as the story shifts to different locations and points of view."
5,k7 is the man,"if you like dance music and your a hard core freestyle fan, then you'll love this cd.this is the music to blast in your car stereo. swing batta swing!"
1,poor what a dissapointment,all i can say is i am a father of 3 kids and that book was a load of bollocks read at your own peril
5,5 thumbs up,"Buhloone Mind State is De La's most creative and versatile work. To me, this record plays a large role in defining underground hip-hop in retrospect. It includes mellow, brilliant elements of jazz with borrowed ideas from jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie (kids playing in the background, traditional playground/summer sounds). The beats are refreshing, original and upbeat. The lyrics are thoughtful and become instantly memorable. De La Soul is an original, creative, and talented group, and they never fail to produce matching records. Buy this album. If you lose it, buy it again. This IS their most dazzling work"
5,De La's pinnacle,"This is the height of De La Soul. Not as goofy (but still as much fun) as 3 Feet or ...is Dead, this is the last record by the group to explore new territory. It strikes a balance between the bohemian elements of their early albums, and a certain maturity. It's the last time out that De La tried anything new and attempted to combine elements of non Hip Hop music (with heavy jazz elements, and off the wall snippets like the inclusion of a crew of Japanese MC's.) This record is also a treat because it's their last with Prince Paul (a split that was their biggest mistake...) The production is flawless, and eclectic. The only disappointment is that they couldn't follow this brilliant record with any more original material. The previously mentioned quote ""I might blow up, but I won't go Pop,"" and Pos's line ""**** bein hard Posdnous is complicated"" both seem to have been thrown out the window on later records - especially the AOI series."
3,"No where near classic , but it's o-kay","This CD left me puzzled . I still cannot understand the hype over this joint . There are only 2 or 3 songs that are worth surviving the fast forward button which are 1. I am I be . 2.Breakadawn . 3. Ego-trippin . Oh yeah , what ever happened to shorty no mas ?"
3,"This album wasn't made for me, but I like it anyway.","This album has alot to do with the idiocy, hippocracy and ignorance of the record industry and their attempt to force hip-hop artists to ""crossover"" to white audiences (Patti Duke etc.). There is a lot of bitterness in here. There is also a lot of good music. I only give it three stars because I'm a picky reviewer and save 4 and 5 stars for truly great albums. This is not one of these in my estimation, but its still worth buying."
1,Bull Looney,"After picking back up my passion for DJing, i had to upgrade my cd libary, i realized that in my de la soul collection, that this was the only one i didnt have not because i didnt think the album was good, I especially wanted it because of that cut called, Tha Break a Dawn.. the reason i didnt buy it was the price it was selling for on amazon, so when i reveiwed what others had to say i was like i gotta have it. so i copped it, bad idea,especially for the price I got the album went through it and was like what the heck was these people listening to? the only song worth the cd is breakadawn... word to the wise for those who shop on amazon, if there are no samples to listen to ten X out of ten the album sucks! Stakes Is High was there greatest album! This album IS STRAIGHT BUHLOONE!"
4,"This album is like wine, it is only appreciated yrs later.","Well i must admit, in the early 90's when i bought this album i slept on its message i thought it was too goofy with the popye imatation. My bruhda and I were rappers then and we thought it was a big joke, with the execption of like three songs, well i must admit when hearing the album again now that i am older and maturer i must say that their message was completely balanced through out the album, i was just into a different vibe at the time, i think that was 93 or 94 im not really sure now, but what i do know now has made me wiser for da future and so, i reccommend this album to anyone who wants a good message and some pure hip-hop dont sleep de la's (BMS) is da real deal!"
4,"One for the ""island""","Yo washup ya'll ... I don't listen to rap anymore ... but if I had to be exiled to an island wit just me and my honey and the choice of 3 rap albums I'd pick Run DMC, Ultramagnetic's 1st and this one. Seriously, I used to argue all the time with my high school pal who was better, De La or Tribe CQ. I said Tribe was better overall, but individual De La songs were better than anything Tribe had ever done. I don't believe that anymore and . . . hm, now I think of it I'd like to bring ""Low End Theory"" too but couldn't knock out any of the above three.... ""Stakes Is High"" was cool here & there but in a totally different way and you could tell De La was De La but De Low everafter."
3,Does not stay on long,I bought this lip color in Carnation shade. The color is cute but wears off soon after applying. It's not very moisturizing and needs a gloss on for sure.
2,Bobbi brown sandwash pink,"After reading a lot of reviews I ordered this online, the color is okay.Not great actually dull. It's not moisturizing. Like mac's creme sheen or anything. I would not buy it again, for sure. My lips were so dry, and the product didn't last long. I've tried a lot of lipsticks. So far you get your moneys worth from MAC. And a few department store brands as well."
4,Indepth look at street basketball across america,"I have read several books regarding street basketball in america. This particular book covers legends across the country. It also takes a look at the sociology of regions. Although the basis of my research has been focused on New York this book was a great, well-written suprise. It is a thoughtful look at personalities and stories surrounding the legends you may have never heard of. If you want to read a good book on the subject this is a great place to start, It is very well written and thoughtful."
2,Overrated; overhyped,"As a senior editor at NBA.com, I feel my opinion holds just as much validity (if validity can be held) as a number of the other reviewers, and a little more than the supposed ""Don Imus"" quote that one of the authors perhaps submitted. While the book should be applauded for its comprehensive look at its subject, it does little to transcend the sad state of postwar sports journalism."
5,Well researched well written,Mr. Wright is a gentleman and a scholar. He has managed to tell a beleivable and moving story of the tragically short life and hideously long twilight death of Sunny Von Bulow
1,I can't recommend reading this book,"Jean-Claude Kovan, Going DeeperMaybe my anticipation was too great or my expectations too high, but this book really bugged me. It's an often heavy, often absurd, often confusing psychospiritual-metaphysical ""novel"" without a plot, character development, or other standard fictional devices. It can't compete with the ""message novels"" of James Redfield (Celestine Prophecy series) or Ayn Rand. There are some inspirational concepts, to be sure, but they've already been written about (better) in the non-fiction works of Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Eckhart Tolle, and others. I actually thought the glossary, odd to have in a work of ""fiction,"" was the most interesting part of the book. Oh well, like the talking dog and ""the Voice"" say: ""If you find what we say helpful, you are welcome to make it yours. Any part with which you do not resonate you are free to discard."" I think I will discard this book."
1,Going Deeper Makes NO Sense,"This book is very boring. Borders on childish and ridiculous. It is about a man who starts to have deep conversations with his dog. I read where this was the author's first attempt with writing a book. Hopefully, he will improve or stop writing all together."
2,going deeper,"The book is too ""far out"" for me..I expected practical steps & at the start it was just too spacey !and I never got into it..I will try again.."
4,"If you like stories of spirtual quests, you'll like GOING DEEPER","In the tradition of wonderful spiritual stories and myths, author Jean-Claude Koven has written an insightful tale.When life makes no sense, I'd recommend sitting down and reading GOING DEEPER."
4,Exraordinary Insight,"Going Deeper is the seekers dream, explaining many of the questions internally asked and perhaps not yet revealed. Jean Claude's use of metaphor is brilliant and downright funny! For anyone on the path of Spirit, this is a ""must read"" for it is all about you and why you are here and how you can sieze your own power and why you will or must. My 22 year old son ""stole"" it from me the first day and I could hear him chuckling all along the way. I thoroughly enjoyed this insightful and delightful story of the life of a fellow wonderer coming into accepting his own divinity and power. I rate this 5 stars even though it says 4 above."
5,Welcome back Luther!,"It takes someone like Luther to make a CD filled with great sounding mature R&B! He sings about love both found and lost, Luther's style is timeless and if you are a fan and don't get this CD, you will really be sorry.Welcome back Luther, R&B really missed you."
5,"Love, Love, Love this CD!","A treat for your ears! Nobody sings it like Luther! His classic R&B style and sultry sounds are extraordinary. If you want a CD where every track is enjoyable, you have found it!!"
5,3 STAR CD WITH A 5 STAR SONG!!,"Luther loved Dionne Warwick as the rest of the world. But, none of us would be able to do justice to a ""Dionne song"" like Luther Vandross.From ""A House Is Not A Home"" to ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"" to ""What The World Needs Now"" to the wonderful version of ""Are You there (with another guy)"" on this CD. 5 STARS!!!!!!!!Other stars on this cd are: ""Take You Out, Grown Thangs, I'd Rather and Any Day Now (Chuck Jackson's 60's mega hit)BUY IT!!!!!!!!"
2,Luther What Happened?,"This cd wasn't totally bad, just not as good as his previous work that I wouldn't have been born if not for his ""Any Love"" or ""Since I Lost My Baby"" but this cd? Luther you can always come back. This overly pop cd is really not a good show of what Luther as one of the best r&b artists alive is capable of."
3,why o why o why,"why didnt he stay retired? the old folks will love this cd, but honestly can i take you home is the best song on the cd. J record is the bomb expecially since they have him, but he needed more time for this cd because it is not going to bring the old fans back or any new ones. GET THE SINGLE CAN I TAKE YOU HOME AND PRETEND YOU ARE A LUTHER FAN!"
1,Me listening to this cd :(,I guess I should just stick to big luther. U know the one who's curl never would really curl. I'm telling u folk lord knows I love me some luther but lil luther just ani't hiten with this one. Any long time luther fan will know wha I mean when I say stick with big luther.
5,Awesome!,"What a better way to spend an evening reading one of my favorite romance novels but to have the sound of Luther Vandross melting the soul of my heart.You know a gifted artist when you hear this new CD by Luther, it was well worth the wait. As I type this review, his music plays. So do I have a favorite song, actually I have a few. Let's see: If I want to do a little stepping, I guess ""Grown Thangs"" can do the job; Hearts of the Matter songs, listen to ""Bring Your Heart To Mine"" and ""Hearts Get Broken All The Time"" But overall, each song can bring something to mind when you're listening. The best way to capture it, is by listening to it over and over. Each time you hear a song, you'll be reminded of something that has happened in your life.If you love good ole' love ballads with a few fast-stepping songs...then this is the CD to purchase."
3,"""Sometimey"" CD","As a major Luther fan I bought this CD based on the ""Can I Take You Out"" song...which is fabulous...but it's downhill from there. Perhaps 4 killer songs here at best. You pick 'em. If this CD was as good as Luther looks now, it would be excellent. His getting in shape and healthy is an inspiration...he deserves bravos for that for sure."
2,LUTHER JUMPS ON THE BANDWAGON,"this is a suprisingly poor effort from a knowing rnb veteran like luther. he has strayed from his own reliable, solid team and brought in the talents of young, hip hop ""yo yo yo"" type gentlemen. it works well for the opening track ""take you out"", a wonderfully simplistic and catchy song, but the remaining 15 or so tracks... oh dear.he even talks about ""being a hater""(?!) this is all very misguided. i love luther but the tunes on this album are not very enjoyable and do not suit his voice, its all a little too up tempo and it sounds very, well, ordinary. an unexceptional album."
5,"Delayed review for several months, just in case","Given that these are to last for years, I thought I'd delay a few months before writing a review. So far, so good.Pros* Perfect OEM fit (drop-in)* Cleans well* No more disposal of paper filters* Better air-flowCons* Initial cost is a bit high, but... long-term this is a non-issue* Requires periodic cleaning (but this is the point) -- so if you like disposable filters, keep buying thoseOther thoughtsThe K&N; as expected is catching all of the junk that an air filter should, and when it gets some more stuff attached, I'll get the cleaning kit and go at it. I have no way to measure HP or torque to substantiate any claims of improvements in those departments. The vehicle feels like it has the same characteristics as before this filter, which is all I was after."
4,Irreverent and Pseudoscientic but Useful Nonetheless,"Peter Carroll's writing style is quite a lot different than the vast majority of occult/pagan/magic writers. This is both pleasant and somewhat annoying at different times. The thing that stands out most to me is how the tone and style of the book fits into several broad stereotypes of 'male' thinking/speaking/writing styles. While not overly off-putting, even to a diehard feminist like myself, it can be a bit distracting. Further, the (mostly joking) arrogant tone is another annoyance. However, if you can overlook all of that it is a very useful book. The ideas and exercises presented in the book are quite good when you're trying to move past old mental structures. Chaos Magick cleanses the palate of the mind so that you can more easily appreciate and experience the world around you. If Chaos Magick interests you, and it really ought to if you're serious about performing magic/k, then this book is a vital addition to your library."
4,Self-analysis and humor in magick,"A work with little magickal use, but vital to prevent arrogance in the magician, Carroll continually pokes holes in the power games and egotism of non-serious practicioners. If you can read this and not see yourself in some chapter you know that you are on the right Path."
1,Babbling,"One gets the idea Carroll woke up one day and thought, ""Time for another book."" He gathered his scribbles together and sent them to the publisher. 41% of the pages are half full or less so the 130 pages are quite a stretch. There's nothing new here, nothing useful. Phil Hine is a much, much better bet."
3,FALCON PRESS ALERT! BEWARE...,"Yes this is the most recent thing that Carroll has written. Yes, it does have a few interesting ideas in it. BUT is it worth the price? I would advise the interested buyer to find a copy and page through it before purchasing. Like all Falcon Press books, this offers more than is actually there."
5,A Heavenly Encounter!,"I first met Dr. James Martin Peebles, the grand spirit featured in ""To Dance with Angels"" through medium Summer Eimers, a friend of the authors. To say the least, the encounter was life-changing. I cannot get enough of the insight, love, and wisdom offered by this beautiful soul. ""To Dance with Angels"" will inspire you, challenge you to look at the world in a more loving light and help you lighten up just a little on this journey through life. I read it for insight again and again."
5,Angels all around us,"Before reading To Dance With Angels, I always told my children about our angels. It felt good to believe that the people we lost were still with us - helping us, guiding us, protecting us... After reading this wonderful book, there is no doubt in my mind that angels are indeed all around us. I discovered that death is not scary (birth is the traumatic part! LOL!), and we choose our lives to learn necessary lessons. This information is powerful and comforting and enlightening. In a funny way, I feel like Dr. Peebles chooses the readers of this book - so if you have found this book and feel drawn to it, read and enjoy it!"
3,no regrets,its well written by what read..i was rather bored with reading it for only 25 minutes if that.. sadly it just wasnt my type of reading..i thought it was by the sample i recieved but on the other i do envy a little on other readers in here as they enjoyed it.
4,Fine selection but scratchiness in some places,The Primo Collection dvd's are often very interesting and this is one of the better ones. The selection of music is first rate although not all of Segovia's best-known works are included. Would have given this five stars but the transfer from vinyl to dvd was not properly remastered. There is noticable intermitant scratchiness throughout the two dvds. This is irritating in some places but not noticable elsewhere. Primo Collection dvd's are inexpensive introductions to great music and I can be more forgiving since they music is great and the price was low. Other Primo Collection dvds do NOT have this issue. If you are just interested in experiencing Segovia this is still a pretty good intro.
2,"Boo you whores, this sucks...","It would make a great movie on it's own - but the fact its called ""mean girls 2"" makes you think it's a crappy remake rather than a proper movie; how on earth can you create a sequel with none of the original actors or plot? It's fab for a girls night in (I thoroughly enjoyed it), but bear in mind it has NOTHING to do with the actual ""mean girls"" film."
4,It's good,"Why did this movie get bad reviews? It was a great sequel and has an excellent soundtrack. I wish there was a soundtrack, cause I love most of the songs in this movie."
4,"Great movie, but Disney stars (except Meaghan, Jennifer, and Nicole)...Huh?","I liked Mean Girls 2, but there were two problems that bugged me: Maiara Walsh and cursing. Maiara Walsh doesn't sound like the Maiara Walsh I saw in Cory In The House. She had a cute Brazilian accent, but now...ick. And all the Dsney stars curse, which I think ruins their image as preppy actresses (Nicole and Jennifer curse once, but Meaghan curses several times). Overall, great movie on ABC Family, but a terrible movie for Disney Channel and their actresses. What y'all think?"
3,FALLS SHORT,"This is not a sequel but a remake of the original. As a sequel goes, it rates up there with Caddy Shack II. The movie starts out with some smart narration as people are compared to the cars that they drive. The message of the story is mixed and lost. At one point it was a High School Animal Farm where the non-plastics were as bad as the plastics, and at other times it was about friendship. The movie starts out at about 4 stars and digresses to no stars during a female football game that made no sense. Rated PG-13, and that is about the age of the audience this film was designed. Three stars is generous, but I am old and the girls are cute. BTW putting sugar in a gas tank is not just mean but is criminal activity."
2,The realistic truth,"When everyone heard about the Mean Girls sequel, our minds went to the worst possibilities. We expected it to be a cheesy knock-off of the first movie. Our thoughts were correct. It is unrepresentative of the classic that Mean Girl fans know and love.Unfortunately, that's the biggest issue with the movie: being unrelentlessly compared to the original. If we saw this movie as a completely different movie, it would be much better. But,it's impossible to not compare the Original and sequel. Our preconceived notions of what a Mean Girls movie needs makes us compare the movie to the original. Mean Girls 2 is an average movie that probably could have found its niche with a teenage audience, but it's instead forced into the ""bad sequel"" group. Whoever's idea it was to make this movie and add the MG2 title to make more money clearly didn't realize how bad of an idea it was."
2,Haven't we seen this already?,"It's the same tired and overused plot once again. A mean group of girls in school terrorizes the main character. She wants revenge and, in getting her revenge, becomes just like the mean girls.We have the typical moment where her and her friends part ways, only to be reunited in the end with a happy ending.The story is old and over-used. Nothing new or exciting brought to the table here. Do these things ever happen in high school? I really doubt it.Seems like a Disney TV movie."
1,OMG So Much Worse Than the Original,I expected this to be a sequel to the original and its not. The script is almost written as a reimagining of the first one. 5 minutes into film you are going to realize its so much worse than you could have ever thought.The writing is so bad and leaves a lot to be desired. There are plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. The sound effects are over the top and annoying. The characters are transparent and throw away. This is another in a long line of films that declare a protagonist and forget to give you a reason to like them.This is where the original was fantastic. Logan was great at sucking you in and Fay was the best at strategically steering the cast into the right places. This movie will lead you astray from the start and never get you back on course.Praise. 13 yo girls will like this but all other avoid at all costs.
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this rather than rent it, as it didn't cost much more. Now I know why. The plot was kind of cute, but that's all that's good about it. The no-name cast didn't prove their mettle. Loved the first Mean Girls."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"If I could give this negative stars I'd give it a negative 100. It doesn't even deserve stars. The lead girl is from stupid Disney channel and threw the whole movie she needed to wash her hair. The 3 ""mean girls"" we're awful, they dressed like 8 year olds and it was retarded that the one brought a dog to school. All the girls couldn't act for there lives. I can quote every line from the first movie because the first movie was pure genius, it was made to be funny. The second one was centered around bullying, that ruins the whole concept. At at the end where she's like ""let's settle this like men, lets play football"" that was the dumbest thing I've ever herd in my life. This movie sucked so bad and should be erased from history."
1,Not A Great Sequel,"I bought this movie not actually seeing it. BIG MISTAKE!I thought it was going to be a lot like the Lindsay Lohan 'Mean Girls' movie and appeal to people who were over the age of 14.I now see this is a movie for young girls between the ages of 10-14. It's got Jennifer Stone from ""Wizards of Waverly Place"", Meaghan Martin from ""Camp Rock"", Nicole Anderson from ""Jonas"", Claire Holt from ""H2o: Just Add Water"", Diego Boneta from ""Rock of Ages"" and ""Pretty Little Liars"", Mairara Walsh from ""Cory In The House"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" -- So it has a few actors and actresses that are well known to a younger audience than myself.If you like the movie like ""Camp Rock"" then you are probably going to like this movie.If you are looking for a great sequel to the awesome Lindsay Lohan ""Mean Girls"" movie, I'm sorry to say but it will just lead to disappointment and regret."
5,A terrific sequel,"This Movie was awesome but the first mean girls is better because it's more entertaining, Anyway a student named Jo goes to north shore high school which was the same high school from the previous film and brought back the principal but everyone else is gone from the first one, Plus can Jo try to get rid of Mandi, The Cast wasn't that bad Meaghan Martin played Jo, Jennifer Stone played Abby, It wasn't the most baddest cast ever because the acting was pretty good and wasn't bad and also Jo goes through a lot in this film, If they made a third Mean girls which would be called mean girls 3 that is out of the question this is not bad for a sequel but if you make it a franchise that would be a waste of time 2 film's for Mean girls and that's it, This movie was pretty good but if you don't think their should be a sequel from the classic then don't watch it."
1,A horrid sequel,"Jo is a transfer student who just wants a quiet school year before she's off to study architecture at Carnegie-Mellon University. She befriends rich but klutzy Abby, a target for the cliquy ""plastics"" led by chief mean girl Mandi. In a twist Abby's father pays Jo to befriend her, and Jo realizes that her new BFF is worth more than the cash. Soon a war between the plastics and well everyone else at the school breaks out. Will Jo come clean with Abby before her secret is revealed?With a d-list cast, bad writing, lots of overacting (never a good thing), and no real story to tell, this sequel is pretty awful. I still cannot believe that I sat through it, particularly when it was paired with the far superior original. Some sequels should just never get made."
1,Terrible,"Ditto everything reviewer Tracy Vest wrote. My sentiments exactly. I couldn't make it through the entire movie without doing something in addition to watching the movie to distract me from its awfulness. So, though the movie was terrible, my dishes and laundry are now done.And: The only good thing about this movie is that it made me want to watch Mean Girls, the good one, not this poor (even for ABC Family) imitation."
1,Can I please get back the time I spent watching this?,"This is awful. This doesn't even deserve to be called a film. Maiara Walsh and Jennifer Stone were horrendous in the Disney shows they originally acted in, but MY GOSH! Who knew there was anything worse than Cory in the House?This is horribly corny, unrealistic, and lame. The humor in the original Mean Girls is replaced with the timid use of two curse words and way too much slapstick. Don't waste your time."
1,Lamest Sequel EVER!,"I caught a glimpse of this film during its premiere on ABC Family, and I was just P.O.ed at the fact that this garbage that is Mean Girls II exists! Avoid this, buy the original 2004 film. It was awesome, and was Lindsay Lohan's 2nd to last film of her ""former"" career (her good career, ranging from 1998 to 2005). The original is also a prime example of how teens (no matter what gender) act."
1,a lousy come back,i didn't like this at all. the original was better. the characters were really lame compared to the first. i found it very boring. i didn't like it also because of the actors. they're new and inexperienced in movie making.
1,this movie = epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie stinks how did this movie get released its horrid pathetic boring lame and boring you want a real movie watch the first mean girls instead of this horrid sequel this movie = epic fail mean girls 2 actors and actresses = epic fail this movie is uber lame and uber boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,another vomit review,i liked the movie but the party scene wear maria walsh has big chunks of vomit all over herdress. that was gross. do not see it. seriously whats so funny wen some one gets puked on its gross. i hate it.
1,I beg you not to waste your money on this!,"This movie is awful, plain and simple. If some fiber of your being urges you to watch this, rent it (it's even undeserving of that), or wait for it to come on ABC Family again. I love the first Mean Girls and I only watched this to see how bad it would be. I was right. Instead of wasting your money on this, go buy the first Mean Girls (again, even if you already have it) or go see that new 3D Justin Bieber movie (just stay away from this). That's how bad this movie is. The most anyone should watch this movie is once."
5,WONDERFUL!,"This book as LOTS of info on the Aussie like health/nutrition, basic training, history, behavior... well, like the title says! It has a neat chapter on the different activities you can do with your Aussies like different competitions. Another whole chapter on training for working and a very informative chapter on service training.This would be a great little book to check out the breed to make sure you want an Aussie in the first place. Also, if you just adopted a puppy or adult and need some quick good info before you go off to buy that $45 Aussie book :)It's easy reading for adults AND kids!"
4,El Book Review,This book is a very handy resource! It is very thorough on the Australian Shepherd and I would recommend anybody that has one to read this book.
3,Love my Mini Aussie!,This book gives alot of misc. information I just wish it had more about specific training techniques. I still have to take myAussie to training classes.
5,Great little book,Being a new Aussie owner I purchased a slew of books on the breed - this little book gives a lot of information and is a great read. You can't go wrong for $3.99!!
2,Australian Shepherds (Barron's Complete Pet Owner's Manuals),"Disappointed, very general book. Most of the material could be about any dog with just a few chapters related to the Australian Shepherd. If you are looking for detailed information about the breed suggest you look someplace else."
5,Inspiring Essays,"These are amazing essays. The authors not only tell about their own personal experiences as daughters of Holocaust survivors, but many essays also include accounts of the horrific experiences of the parents during the Holocaust. It's through books like this that we are reminded to never forget the horrors of the past, and at the same time, we are reminded about the strength and determination of the human spirit. The ""daughters"" have not only survived, they have also thrived. They can serve as role models and inspiration for all."
5,A remarkable collection.,"Mindy Weisel has beautifully compiled, and elegantly introduced, a remarkable collection of intimate pieces on the most difficult of topics."
5,Impeccable performance with great sound quality,"In my opinion, this album is right up there with Song for My Father. Each track, as a previous review said, is paractically flawless. Tthe first four tracks are very laid back, colorful and interesting rhythmically and melodically. The head to ""silver's Serenade"" is just wonderfully composed. The last track, 19 Bars, is a fast, smoking tune. A hard song to solo over, a 19 bar pattern is far from usual, but the soloists handle it perfectly. this album is really underrated. You will not be dissapointed with Silver's Serenade, especially if you have heard other Horace Silver almbums."
5,Reach (for the *stars*),"Reach is S Club 7's hot new release and is currently at #2 on the charts in the U.K. The songs on the cd include... 1. Reach- a very up-beat, feel good song 2. S Club Party (Paul & Brad's remix)-a great song 3. Someday, Someway- another great song!Reach is a great CD to add to your collection. If you've liked S Club 7's songs so far you'll love this one!"
1,Jungle drums of Africa,"It wouldn't play. I tried it in both computers, and both DVD players and couldn't get it to work. I returned it requesting a replacement and was given a credit instead."
3,Solid - Competent - Dull,"This book delivers exactly what the title promises. It is the story of the relationships within the Ford family, especially Henry and his son Edsel. Unfortunately this makes for a rather dull book.I was hoping for more about the products and processes within Ford Motor Company. These topics have been well covered by others but reading about them from yet another source could be interesting. There may well be an audience for this story as told but I am not part of it."
3,Not what I expected,"This cd has a very eclectic mix of music, with a really broad and what seemed to me a somewhat odd range of music styles.Personally, I bought this cd for the VERY rare and hard to get track, 'Painted Moon' by The Silencers. Therefore I was a bit annoyed when I got the cd, stuck it in my stereo and discovered that this song is a LIVE version. I wish the CD had mentioned that this was the case on the song list. I didn't want the live version - I wanted the studio version.So please note: some of the songs on it are live versions, even if they aren't listed as such. There, you've been warned!"
2,pro- muslim bias,"I strongly encourage you to read the excerpt pages before buying this book. If you look carefully, you will find many opinions snuck in as fact. These opinions are always slanted toward the Muslim side. For example, it calls the difference between the Koran's account of Jesus' birth and the Bible's, ""inspired."" That is an opinion. This is not an objective comparision of the two religion's viewpoints. It is more positive toward the Muslim religion than the Christian one. That may or may not have been the author's intention, but it is there. You may want to consider this in deciding if this book is for you or not."
4,Seems to work great,Bought this Firewire card in hopes for maximum compatibility with my M-Audio Firewire 1814 audio interface and the result seems flawless so far (compared to previous firewire adapter which used VIA's FW chipset).
2,Rather caged really,"2 1/2The rashly bland turn towards electro-pop is about as super a prog-metal group does not get- only ""Set It on Fire"" on the more adventurous bonus disc seems to have anything to say in this new regard."
2,Wish I had read Nellie Bly before I opened!,"There were also no codes on my jewel case and I have just started my emails to the company. Obviously, I can expect to be at this for some time! And from Nellie's review, I am not sure it is worth the time and trouble. The package cannot be returned to Amazon since it has been opened. But one has to open it to install and try to find the codes--CATCH 22. Online, Amazon says it ships from Target, but it shipped from Amazon according to the package it cam in. The whole thing is a big disappointment so far."
4,A little bit hard,"The game was good until the forest in Madagascar. I really liked the board game in Lapland. However, in Madagascar, the search for the lemur was difficult. No matter which direction you face, the lemur's cry does not sound louder or softer and it was either to the left or right but never centered. At certain points, the game crashes when looking for the lemur. Although the box claims the game will work on OS 10.3, it would not run on our computer (OS10.3.9) It did work when we installed it on a computer running 10.4, so beware."
2,"Somebody, please","Can somebody please list the 'code' they used? It might not work for my game, but at least it would give the form that the code should be in. I, too, got the jewel box without a codeEdit: 9/22/11 I did get a response back about the code. Try 5960-0280-9960-0280 ...no, it's not an error., put in 0280 twice. It worked for me on my Mac version.John"
1,"same problem ""Genève Gil"" reported","And had almost the same experience, to wit:- loaded it onto a Mac laptop- it crashed at the key box, despite multiple attempts- I sent a note via the AGON webpage feedback- I got a prompt reply with links for patches in two different formats- I downloaded both patches, but neither works -- same error message as ""Genève Gil"" describesThis is really annoying! I just saw a comment somewhere that said the program doesn't run on Mac laptops, but I don't see that on the amazon.com site. Not a happy customer!"
4,"Great information, but bring salt.","Greer does a great service to the occult community with this book. Some of the best parts of this book deal with the drudgework and mundane aspects of lodge management -- creating the ritual, handling the legal aspects of creating a lodge, and maintaining the lodge on the administrative end. However, when he starts getting into the inner parts of lodgework, he tends to pass off his own personal (or his tradition's) theories and ideas as fact. It's a great deal of good information to ponder, but shouldn't necessarily be taken literally.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to those interested in both occult and non-occult Fraternal-type orders."
2,"A good intro to Goa, but not much else","The above mentioned pretty much says it all. There is better stuff out there in this ever growing genre. If you have not heard much in this genre, track 1 will pump you up, and some of the first five tracks will amuse you, but the rest of the album just fizzles out."
1,Blatant Rip-Off,"The problem with this item is that all the software referenced in the user manual DOES NOT EXIST! There are two utilities for managing the card that are just not available on the packaged CD or on the D-Link web site. This makes it absolutely worthless for using WPA2-AES encryption. ""Customer Service"" does not care and has stopped responding to my e-mails. Avoid this one!"
4,Very cute comfortable shoe,This shoe was the only one my daughter would wear when she was 3-4m old without trying to kick them off. It fit her great and seemed comfortable to her. I was bummed when she grew out of them.
4,Plan Toys Airport,What a great toy for pre-schoolers or early elementary aged children! The wooden structure is well-made and not difficult to put together. My grandson loved it and the extra airplane and helicopter I ordered.
1,Maximum,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!! i can't stress that enough i bought it and listened to it and it is way cheesy it is narrated by a british woman and set to cheesy music the whole CD is clips from interviews from sessions on AOL and most of the information is wrong. ie;it has gerards birthday as april,3rd instead of the 9th the only thing decent was the picture and matching poster about 8x10 size i had never seen it before...but mostly it was the narrator praising the band -MCR fan"
5,X-Acto Blade Chisel #17 5/Pk,The reason I went to Amazon Com. for X-Acto Blades was they are so hard to find in the stores in Sault Ste. Marie. My personal feeling is they should be in larger numbers in packaging. For the X-Acto product they are great for hobbies and general use.
4,Get into it.,"This cd will be remebered by this listener as the one that turned me onto Sam Rivers. Cut in 1964, the session personnel includes Lary Young on organ, Grant Green on guitar, Elvin Jones on drums, and Sam Rivers on tenor saxophone. Overall the music on this cd is superb, without a throw away recording each of these tracks has the musicans turning in outstanding performances. Standout moments are difficult to choose from, but River's note bending solo on ""Plaza De Toros"" caused me to listen to the track numerous times my first time though. Not as energetic or as highly regarded as ""Unity"" this is a superior set of music that I recommend to fans of that disc or of the artists involved."
4,Into It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album has some pretty good compositions by organist Larry Young, and guitarist Grant Green. The first song just soothes you with its lightly swingin', but groovin' solos. The next tune, Plaza De Tores, is cool, and so are the rest. One factor I did not like of this album was that Elvin Jones didn't get any drum solos. When I first got this album, I didn't know who Sam Rivers was, and now, I still barely ever hear of him, but his contribution to this album is wonderful. This recording prooved that Young was a good songwriter and improviser. The group pulls it off well without a bass player too. Any jazz fan can't go wrong with this album. It is not free or Avant Garde, just swingin' jazz. I've yet to get Young's Unity album, and from what I've heard, it's different, but If Young plays the same, I'm sure to love it. This is just another great swingin' Blue Note album, and can be compared to others such as Sidewinder, Blue Train, and The Real McCoy!"
5,BLATZ,"best split ever...blatz are one of my favorite bands i love the screaming girl,hustler is an awesome song...filth are a great crustish band"
3,It is ok.,Had a problem with software. It did not detect my phone. Had to called the company to fix the problem. The company does not have toll free number. It works now but I would buy original samsung data kit at ebay.
1,"Mine was broken, too","I didn't even take it all the way out of the package. I heard the pieces rattling around inside and only opened it far enough to confirm that it was broken. I really wanted it but won't ask for a replacement since it would arrive broken, also. The packaging is just plain silly."
1,ongoing packaging problem,"Wow. Looking at these other reviews it looks like Amazon has a real packaging problem. This is exactly the kind of board I have been looking for, at a good price. The first one arrived in its simple cardboard box with two skinny pieces of foam. I could tell by the rattle that things were not well. To its credit, Amazon is very good about customer service, and UPS picked it up the next day. The replacement arrived today, the same simple box packed in a much larger box, with a couple of crumpled up pieces of paper to protect it. Not. This board was in three pieces. Amazon will refund me my money, and suggests I select another seller. I would like to have them make good on preparing an order. But somebody has to be getting the message, and stop wasting all this time, energy, and marble."
2,"A collection of ""folk tales"" about the Chinese.","This book, which won the 1926 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature, is a collection of stories about the Chinese told as if they were folk tales (however, I have later discovered that they may not be true folktales but Chrisman's original stories). I didn't really care for them and I wouldn't recommend them strongly for children today. But, I'm probably in the minority with that viewpoint."
1,Shen of the Sea,"I had to read this book for a Literature class I am taking. I found it difficult to read. The characters names were often so similar that you were confused about who was who.I did think that some of the stories had cute references about how things came to be (i.e. the story about the Chop-Sticks).Unfortunately, had I not been forced to read it for class I don't think I would have read further than the first couple of stories."
2,Barely Entertaining,"This is an early Newberry Award winner that has me wondering if this was a bad year for children's literature. Shen of the Sea has a few stories that entertain but many are repetitive and lack depth. It was clearly not based on fact. Some of the stories will probably be liked by children. Dragons, wars, and children bewitched will help with any kid's imagination. I've just read better."
1,This is a Newberry Award Winner?!?,"I got this book because I was looking for a collection of Chinese stories and this was a Newberry Award Winner. I read one story to my daughter and knew immediately that they were not real Chinese stories but were the author's inventions. The Chinese people were portrayed like buffoons -- quite demeaning! The names given to the Chinese in the book seem like the worst made-up names by a non-Chinese speaker (i.e. Ching Chang, Ching Chung...)."
3,This is ok...,If you do not like little Chinese stories you will not like this book. If you like little Chinese stories you Will like this book. I did not like this book because of all of the little short stories. The one story i liked was the war story. I also like the first chapter it is really good. I did not like the 5th chapter it was boring.
2,outdated,"I too, had to read this for a (children's) literature class and I found it to be extremely dry and boring. It is also questionable whether these are ""authentic"" folktales or short stories written ""in the style"" of Chinese folktales, circa 1926. I don't think Chrisman ever traveled to China in his lifetime. As an adult, I also don't feel these stories would capture the interest of children. I am certain there are more interesting, authentic (and updated) Chinese literature out there."
3,"Sensible, Wise Advice for Stepparents","I'm not a stepparent yet, but I'm dating a divorced man with two kids and I want to educate myself on what to expect if/when we marry. This book presents the step situation from everyone's point of view--the kids, the bio parents, the stepparents, even grandparents. Potential problems are explained and sensible ways to deal with them are offered. What I liked best is that the author emphasizes the kids--what kind of home are you creating for them? How does what you do--from dating to planning your wedding--affect them?This book has helped me overcome some of my fears about ""what am I getting into."" I feel much better prepared for the future.I would give it more stars except for two flaws: 1) it doesn't go into enough detail on some subjects, such as ways to build a pleasant, respectful relationship with your stepkids, and 2) it is poorly written and edited. As an editor, I could hardly stand the numerous grammatical errors and awkwardly expressed thoughts."
5,For the Bio parent and Stepparent!,"Although Lofas has updated things since this book was originally published, this is a great resource. One thing that sets this book apart from the numerous others on stepparenting is that it speaks to the biological parent as well as the stepparent. Suggestions for opening dialogue between partners coming from entirely different backgrounds, and problem solving steps and procedures are prescribed.The viewpoints of the stepparent, the biological parent, and the child are detailed. This makes it somewhat easier to understand one another.Teamwork and the re-establishment of the household are the major emphasis here. The discussion starters that Lofas suggests between two partners can be a bit painful and emotional, but help lead to a better understanding of each other. Thus, a stronger bond is created."
4,"Good card, short life.","The card ran fine while it lasted. I spend alot of my free time playing WoW and this card was a vast improvement over the original in my system. I was very happy for a short time.The fan on this card died after a couple of months, I replaced it with a Zalmam CU-700 and it ran fine making me happy again, for several more months, then it died completely, shutting down the computer. Took me a bit to prove that the video card was the card was the initial cause, but it was. If you are a bit luckier than I was you'll be happy with this card, like I was at first."
4,Saga influenced novel written in the early 20th century.,"Although the story is based in Sweden instead of Iceland or Norway and is more ""novel"" oriented than the crash and burn style storylines that permeate the Sagas, it is obviously heavily influenced by Icelandic/Norse Sagas and I believe this book actually won a Nobel Prize for literature. This is close to being a five star book but the story ran out of steam in the last third or so. I still enjoyed it."
2,Short too short,"I was hoping to get a complete tour of San Francisco in this DVD. Instead I got a fast paced video of the most beautiful city of the USA. Where is Sausalito, Tiburon, The Cliff House for god's sake...the bay bridge, the Hotel San Francis, among other main things that are complete ignored?"
3,"Great music, but a poor product...","I agree... What is MCA's (and by extension, Universal's...) problem with being so goddamn stingy with their reissue records??? It just doesn't make sense to put out such skimpy records for an audience that has become used to top-notch, 20+ track reissue albums. Still, the first reviewer is right, too: there's nothing wrong with the music that's on here. There just oughtta be more of it."
2,20th Century Master Cheapskates,"The first reviewer is right. Why bother with this disc when you have so many better choices out there. Get the original studio albums, particularly GILDED PALACE + BURRITO DELUXE (2 for 1). Meanwhile, hope and pray that the self-titled third album, issued years ago by Mobile Fidelity but now out of print, gets reissued. Remember, if you see these look-alike discs in this 20th Century Masters series on any of your favorite artists, you can bet you're going to be shortchanged. This series is all about money - not music - or artwork."
5,This is a very worthwhile CD. Time well spent.,"This album seems to consist mostly of remixes of previous works by the Children of Dub. Though it lacks the personality of an actual album release, it makes up for this greatly by having very streamlined production. On ""The silent pool"" they still had a rough around the edges sound, but have now evolved greatly. The remixes on ""Analog Meditaion"" are very expansive, intriguing, thought provoking, and enjoyable to say the least. It is a very mysterious and timeless sound. Children of Dub is music to get happily lost in. The only letdown I have in this album is that I can't find more music like it. ""Analog Meditation"" has spoiled me."
4,Worth buying ...,"Holy crap, Steve Stevens has some awesome chops on this disc. OK, some of the electronic guitar blurbs sound a tad cheezy, but other than that, your ears are in for a real treat. Great cover of Saxon's ""Set Me Free."" Great production, a wall of guitars, a real treat with some good quality headphones. A hugely underated album. Can't believe it's here at such a low price!"
5,"Invest a little, get a lot","I started seriously investing back in 1985. I found a computer program called, ""My Way"" which looked like it would work well. It did, but there was no feed-back in the system. So I invested [.....] in this little book by Robert Lichello. God bless you Robert Lichello. You have made my family millionaires, Plus. The plus is that now when the market tanks, we understand how to profit from the confusion. Robert, your writing style is corny, but your thinking is pretty darn close to brilliant. I would strongly encourage anyone serious about investing to read this book and then say a prayer for Robert's soul. He left the world a priceless gift before he left this world."
3,Very Wordy - But Interesting,"Overall the concepts are valid, but the book is very wordy. I used his methods to develop a excel spreadsheet with sample information on CSCO stock--very interesting results. On paper I was able to make over 100% profit on a $50,000 investment--if this works in real life, wow"
2,Somewhat Misleading,"I had bought this book with the expectation of learning how to achieve high returns on investment, but was quite disappointed when I found out it was simply a book on financial planning!There is no magic strategy: the author just gives a strategy of monthly investing and managing risk. In the end I am sure you'll make a million dollars, but you'll be an old man by that time!The strategy in itself is not flawed, but it won't provide you with mega returns: (...)The writig style was a bit heavy to digest, many stories were not relevant and more importantly: where are the RESULTS?? I'd like to know how AIM performed in the past.Overall, a bit misleading, but the idea in itself is OK(...)"
1,Unbelievable!!,"Not one reviewer ever mentioned the concept of historical back testing under many different economic scenarious. I would think it obvious that the way to find out if the formula AIM works is to test it with historical data. Granted that one would need a spreadsheet and formula to do the back testing. My results? I back tested under many different economic conditions using stocks and mutual funds, and Im not impressed. The Lichello AIM did not always do better than the buy-and-hold system and sometimes did worse and sometimes did better. It all depends on starting with the right stock at the right time, but once you have the right stock other systems will also do better. But don't take my word for it, do the back testing yourself before actually investing your hard earned money. About the writing? I loved it, but that does not mean his system will make money for you."
1,A Million???,"One must ask if the system is so good why has the author not used it to make $1,000,000 then some more. Just beware that Dollar cost averaging can be very dangerous. If one is going to write the talk,, why not walk the talk??? Maybe the author makes more money writing and following other ventures?? Maybe some ideas are valid and worth thinking about, but much simpler and more effective systems are about just for the asking and a little hard work!!! If it was all free lunches, who would be left to prepare the lunch. Trading is like life ,,what you put in you get out!!! A million just like that,,,I'd like to see that!!"
1,This book was bad.,"This book was overdramatized. There were too many stories. The AIM system for investment might be a good one, but its usefulness, especially compared to other systems, lies buried underneath too many words. It took a lot of patience to complete it"
3,"Sound concepts, too wordy, too much space used for tables","Painstakingly simplistic and repetitive. Could consider these positive or negative points. I considered them negative. Give me the concept, examples at middle and either extreem, then a lesson on fighting temptation to violate the ""AIM"". That would have been sufficient and used 50% of the page count."
3,"Interesting concept, but 150 pages too long!","As a reader of this book, in an earlier published addition, I was interested in the changes as advertised for the 90's. It was the same wordy, self-congratulatory effort as earlier. However, Mr. Lichello recognized that a 50-50 split of equities and cash was far too conservative. But is this book not just asset-allocation wrapped in a formula?"
1,"Hey Lichello, SHOW US THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!","The book and the system has been around since 1977. If the title is not false advertising, then Lichello should have made over $1,000,000 in the Stock Market - Automatically! himself. So, Lichello, SHOW US THE MONEY!!! Or is your system all hype and not working???????"
1,"A.I.M. for the garbage can, 0 stars","The strategy makes no sense. The author compounds the problem by writing in an overdramatic but boring and annoying style. He isn't a financial genius, that's for sure! He isn't much of an author either. The whole thing could have been very well covered in about 10 pages. A.I.M. for the garbage can, because that's where this book belongs."
1,Great Way To Lose Big Bucks!,"Please listen to somebody who read this book, gave it too much attention, and managed to go on to lose 100%. What this book does not give credence to is the fact that people are often irrational and emotional. I firmly believe this was a parting gift to the securities industry, as payback to give the average Joe the illusion that there is some fullproof system or method for becoming a millionaire. What usually happens is small investors become obsessed with a stock, say the heck with the system, and go on to lose everything. STICK TO MUTUAL FUNDS FOR STOCK INVESTING. Note:it's investing NOT trading!"
4,Very Interesting and Highly Readable - Best for Conservative Investors,"The formulas set forth in the book are very helpful and the book is easy to read. It is a good value for the money. I think the formulas would work well for a very conservative investor. The book also includes a formula for making periodic investments in mutual funds. I backtested the book's approach over the last ten years using the mutual funds in my 401(k) which are offered by American Funds. For most periods, the results were better for the book's approach than simple dollar cost averaging. Because the market is presently up significantly, the dollar cost average approach is currently ahead but the book's approach will be better if the market turns down."
4,Book Offers Investment Clubs Two Conservative Strategies,"Most Investment Clubs that have existed for some time have accumulated a portfolio that would benefit from management by the A.I.M. method. It would simplify club SELL decisions and also let the club respond more actively during market corrections by using AIM's Cash Reserve for additional buying.Also, Mr. Lichello's TWINVEST method is a far better approach than the classic Dollar Cost Averaging that almost all investment clubs use. It has the side benefit of letting the club accumulate the stock AND an adequate cash reserve for that stock to fund yet another AIM account as it grows.I'm surprised that NAIC has never embraced the dual concepts of A.I.M. and TWINVEST!"
5,Fall of 1998 proved AIM's worth to long term investors,"If anyone is still skeptical after the massive market bashing that we had between the beginning of August and the middle of October, they haven't fully explored what AIM would have done for them.In that period, my own cash reserves were drawn down from about 35% to about 5% while I bought up huge quantities of underpriced stocks and funds. Then, my account rose in total value about 18% in October alone. I've already returned many of my AIM accounts to a 30% Cash Reserve level. Thank you AIM and Mr. Lichello!!AIM is portfolio risk management, plain and simple. It automatically adjusts asset allocation between equity and cash to protect profits in rising markets and then reinvest the proceeds when the market is falling.An AIM users group can be found by using a search engine and the work ""LICHELLO"" if you care to hear what other AIMers have accomplished. Good luck and AIM High!"
5,One of my favorite books,great book. It has been a big pafrt of my gaininng the c ourage to start managing my on investments. Couldn't bne happier.
2,Anthropologist in Indonesia,"Nigel Barley is an English antropologist who makes a visit to Torajaland in Sulawesi, Indonesia. He says in his foreword that he want to tell the stories that more traditional antropological books don't tell. The result is sometimes funny but otherwise not very remarkable."
1,NFG,I bought these today liking the over the ear and colapsable feature which i was looking for. Absolute garbage. The volume is just not there and the bass is not what the packaging says. They are comfortable but not worth the money. I am extremely dissapointed. I will return them as soon as I can for a full refund or exchange. I advise everyone to stay away from these headphones. They are not good at all!! I give them -5 stars! 0 stars rating is not offered.
2,Junk.,"Surprisingly comfortable, nice design, but ultimately the sound is weak and hollow. Almost no bass. Will turn your favorite music to mush. Steer clear."
3,"Comfortable but very quiet, bass lacking","I bought these headphones for extended listening periods as they were the most comfortable pair I could find. Primarily for use on my computer while listening to audio books, talk radio, and podcasts. And for that they work quite well.Music on the other hand...The sound quality just isn't there. These need a lot of power to sound reasonable and even then the bass is very quiet and muffled. The highs are ok at best and the middle range is iffy. The sound, as a whole, is just way too inaccurate. Don't even bother with portable devices.The only redeeming quality with these is the comfort, otherwise I think you could easily do much better shopping around a bit. Three stars is generous, 2 and a half."
1,"false advertising, no bass, very low volume",I agree with the low reviews. The volume is just not there and the bass is not what the packaging says. They are not worth the money. I am extremely dissapointed. I advise everyone to stay away from these headphones. I have some cheap ear buds that came with my mp3 player that blow away these headphones for both volume and bass.
3,Nice but wrinkly,These sheets are a nice quality. Thick fabric with good stitching. Pretty design. The only draw back is because they are 100% cotton they are extremely wrinkled out of the dryer. The wrinkles don't bother me but some people may not like it especially since it detracts from the overall appearance.
5,One of My Favorites,This tape is so up lifting. When I'm down I just play it over and over. The Gaithers has brought life back into the old favorites and introduced us to the new groups to carry on the messages of praise.
4,All in the title.,"Brings back memories. Great cd which includes the tracks which made freestyle. SA-FIRE, TKA, CYNTHIA, and SWEET SENSATION are classics. If you like freestyle, get this cd. What more can I say, like the title goes, FREESTYLES' GREATEST."
4,"Some fabulous logos, not enough background","There is no doubt this book contains some beautiful and smart logos. I just wish more information would have been given about the clients. In fact, some of the best logos in the book are in the introduction, designed by the author, and here a very brief desciption of the client is given (such as ""Logo to identify certified vegan foods""). But this stops once the heart of the book begins. To be fully appreciated, a logo needs to have context, and none is given in this book except for the client's name (such as ""VIP Industries"" - who?).Nevertheless, definitely worth buying."
4,great!,"i'm a graphic designer student and I needed a book that shows me some logos and letterhead...This is a goob book, nothing amazing though, but very cool that shows a lot of good stuff (nothing outdated)I liked it a lot (not my favorite) and in it saw stuff that gave me good inspiration..."
4,another Beauvoir,"A very beautiful book which reveals another Simon de beauvoir: the one in love. She's passionate, sincere, writing with her heart to his ""beloved"" transatlantic love. They met in America when Simon came to give a cycle of conferences around the States, and they started to write from this moment. We see how their love rises, how they open their hearts letter by letter, and we realize that her love was nothing but authentic. It's also a very interesting reading about life in Paris among the intellectuals of the time, the day by day with Sartre and their travelling together around the world. You really get in touch with this time and this circle of people. Very touching."
5,Spectacular resource,"Wow! What a great tool for seniors. This book is a treasure chest of information. I've been reading The Savvy Senior column in my newspaper for the last year and find its diversity and depth of topics impressive. The Savvy Senior covers everything from weight-training for seniors to appealing Medicare decisions in a factual but fun style. One of the best things about the book? Savvy Resources, whereby the author lists websites,organizations and places to turn for in-depth information on a topic. Worth every penny!!!"
3,Short and sweet?,"Because of all the great reviews, I was expecting a lot more. This book is very small, less than a hundred pages and can easily be read in a few hours. I would never expect this book to be nearly as expensive as it was (I'm so glad I checked it out at the library!)This book is very short and succinct. It has 25 chapters from 1-6 pages each. Most of the concepts are common sense: you won't get the money if you don't ask for it, enthusiasm is contagious.... However, this little book is motivating and gets its point across simply, which is good.Though I do think Jerry's approach may be a little too pushy and even manipulative for my comfort level. And if he said ""I'm not smart enough for ..."" one more time, I thought I was going to gag."
4,Great reading,The book is a wonderful book that will get your board excited about fundraising with good suggestions and encouragement.
5,"Great, Easy-to-Read Book","Jerold Panas has a winner here with ""Asking."" This is the third book of his I read, and in my opinion, it is the best out of the three I have read (I also read ""Born to Raise"" and ""MegaGifts""). Panas makes it easy to understand how to ask for money, and it barely did take me over an hour to read. He gives great advice on how to set up appointments, talk to prospects,how to ask for money, and great suggestions for objections. I definitely recommend this book for anybody that is interested in fundraising. I am hoping to get into the industry and this book gave me a great introduction on how to ask for money. Get this book!"
3,Useful but outrageously priced,"Would I buy this book again? Yes, I suppose so. Would I resent paying the money? Definitely. Most of what is found in this tiny little book is available from other sources for free. It took me a while to spend any time with the book because I was so irritated by the size and what I found inside. The organization of the text and the step-by-step approach to fund raising is will written and digestible. The content is good, at times very good. It certainly boosts your confidence about contacting potential donors. I will keep it, I will refer to it occasionally, but I will always suspect that it was produced principally to be a fund raising tool for the author and the publisher."
4,Monk quartet,"The playing is very good, but seems a bit awkward and strained due to the lack of an audience on both sessions; the players seem a but more relaxed on the second session (some of the players even make a cute imitation of the Monk dance). Overall it's fun watching Monk use those unorthodox fingerings to get his sound out and 'Round Midnight is classic. Definitely worth a purchase to see good, quality footage of the quartet, but I don't think it's the most enjoyable DVD of the series."
3,Ehhh. A little disappointing...,"I would totally agree with the above review, Eldridge picks many of the same brands to showcase and perhaps my aesthetic tastes are very specific or my standards are high, but not all of them deserve to be in a book that is supposedly showcasing ""good"" design. Maybe it's supposed to be displaying a wide range of design taste, but I expected some sort of standard to be selected - for example, there was a plain Ann Taylor carrier bag that they stuck in there (the plain off-white ones - not even the pretty grey ones with the satin handles and pink interiors!), which reinforced my opinions that the book contains more filler and fluff than clever design worthy to be praised.If you're considering buying this, I suggest you first go to a bookstore and flip through it for yourself."
3,It has good examples of a pretty wide variaty of bag designs...,It has good examples of a pretty wide variaty.I found this book ok. I bought it just to be updated with the latest bag designs.I am glad that the package arrived my home in South America in very good conditons.
5,Great Inspirational Tool,Flip through to find the design that inspires you - and create your project. This book is filled with inspiration
3,Great Reference book,"Being in graphic design, it is always nice to be able to have some reference books to look at for ideas and to get the creativity flowing."
3,human nature,"hey miles fans need your help, mr davis did m. jackson cover of human nature. what album is it on?"
3,im reviewing a cd and am very pleased about it,"this is a pretty good cd, it has non stop fast psychedlic trance made for all of your manliest trance music desires. it is definitley worth the money."
3,Internationalization,Ineeded this book as Iam Internationalising one of the modules in my current Project. It is needed for globalisation of the product which can be read in multibytes.
4,Good product,"Works well with my very fine hair-- dries without feeling stiff or tacky.One complaint: it has a ""men's cologne"" scent that I find overpowering. An unscented version would be perfect.This product doesn't seem to be in production by L'Oreal any longer, so get it while you can if you like it."
2,L'Oreal Thickening Foam,"I must admit this does work well, however it has an intensely strong cologne smell to it that is almost impossible to mask unless you wash it out."
4,Great Product,Have been using this product for over 10 years. My old one started cracking and I thought I better get a replacement. I usually use it to dry out my washed (and very well rinsed) freezer bags I use for bread and vegetables. Aids in recycling and economical. My only issue is that I do not know which would be worse - using more water by washing the bags or filling the landfills by throwing them away???Otherwise product works very well. I use mineral spirits on it occasionally for maintenance
5,this is my second one!,I have had mine for over 20 years. paid 14.95 for the first one...glad to find this again. Mine finally got moldy and the base and one of the dowels broke...highly recommend this item!! so glad it's still out there!!
3,"Great idea, but....","When I happened to come across this while browsing for something else, my first thought was, ""What a fantastic idea!"" I'd been trying to dry my plastic bags in a dish rack, and it didn't work well at all. I looked into it, had my mouse hovered over the ""Add to Cart"" button... and then I took another look at the picture and thought, ""Wait a minute. Can't I accomplish the exact same thing with a straight glass, a rubber band, and five stick-like things like chopsticks or straws?""...so that's what I did."
3,"If you're a Bond fan, a great novelty","I think this is more of a CD for fans of Bond music than D-n-B afficionados. It's pretty par for the course as jungle goes, but it's a kick if you love the Bond tracks. Basically, if yer gonna have a spy/ Bond party, buy this, Mai Tai's ""Secret Agent Sounds,"" Arnold's Bond Project, the 30th Anniversary Bond, a few Ultra-Lounge cd's, and you're set!"
2,Use Dependant,"I bought this CD to be background music for a 007 party. While the majority of the pieces are adequate, being banal drivel can fade into the background, some are truly frightening. In particular, there is A View To A Kill Part 2, which must use clips from the raw format vocals. Remember the awards performance where Simon Le Bon was either too drunk or too drugged out to carry a tune? This is the same screeching, cracking, off-tune, hysterical (as in ""hysterics,"" not as in ""funny"") vocal. Interestingly, Part 2 comes before Part 1 on the CD, and part 1 is better. It has been commented before that these are not particularly famous D&B artists, and this certainly is what I would imagine second-rate performers to sound like. I would probably be better off buying a movie soundtrack."
1,A Slap in the Face of All True Bond Fans,"If anyone wants to hear a real Bond remix, don't buy this. I've heard original Bond tunes (take in mind that the ones I'm talking about are more than 30 years old) that could blow these ...away.Have you ever heard of ANY of the artists on this disc?I thought not."
3,IN A WORLD...,"In a world where there is no law, only the rules of logic remain. This compilation of spiced up Bond tunes comes off more like the ""Spice Girls."" Techno pop never sounded so annoying. Look for the real thang baby. Elevator music for the whole family."
5,BEST BOND MIXES ON CD,"THIS CD IS AN ABSOLUTE MIND TRIP, IF YOUR INTO BOND AND ELECTRONIC MUSIC U WILL LOVE THIS CD. SURE ALL THE REMIXES ARENT THAT GREAT N U WISH THE COMPLINATION REMIXED ALL THE JAMES BOND SONGS BUT I WAS EXTREMLY HAPPY WHEN I PURCHASED THIS CD. AND IF YOUR LOOKING FOR OTHER REMIXES THEY R OUT THERE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (PORTISHEAD MIX ) AMAZING MIX...CANT WAIT FOR A NEW BOND TO COME OUT THEY KEEP MAKIN EM BETTER N BETTER...NOT AS GOOD AS THE CLASSICS BUT HEY AT LEAST THEY R BETTER THEN THE GOLDENEYE AND TOMORROW NEVER DIES WHICH WERE AMERICANIZED VERSIONS OF JAMES BOND AND THAT DIDNT WORK FOR ME."
2,A bit uneven,"In my opinion this album is only so-so. It has a few good songs, but the majority of it is just not worth a second listen. Honestly, I can't even tell you which songs are good or bad because I couldn't listen to it enough times to remember the names of the songs.If you'd like a great album from Blackfoot get Strikes."
2,Blackfoot's weakest,"It seems everyone (but poor Brad Starr) gives this album five stars. I can't believe it! I'm a fan of Blackfoot, I have all the albums and to me this is without doubt their weakest release.I'm aware that we all have our opinions but to buy records based on the customer's rating is very risky - almost everyone seems to give everything five stars.If you're curious about Blackfoot you should get ""Strikes"" (1979), ""Maurauder"" (1981) and ""Siogo"" (1983). If they pleases you then buy ""Flying high"" (1976) and ""No reservations"" (1975)."
2,Shorty,"This CD is not so good. Fourth-rate ZZ Top (and I love ZZ). Dullard lyrics, ok guitars and production. Makes Foreigner seem creative by comparison. Nevertheless, there is an intro on the last song by Shorty Medlocke (sp?) that is worth the price of the whole CD: a talking piece that morphs into a harmonica-toot/shout, and bloodhound-calling rip. If you can afford to spend the $$ for this twenty seconds of brilliance, do it. I'm kinda glad I did, but kinda steamed that the rest is solid waste."
4,Blackfoot: Tomcattin',"Hard-edged Southern rock band that not too many people know about. Red hot riffs, catchy tunes that will make you tap your feet. Blue-collar lyrics, down to earth stories that's a little bit country, but backed-up by a heavy metal foundation. Recommended by those who have always liked old-school Lynard Skynard, ZZ top and 38 Special. Rock-on!"
5,My personal favorite,"Of all their albums this one is the best. High energy and flat out just going for it. The entire band gives the performances all they've got and it shows. When you get in a wild rockin' mood, this is the one to reach for. Sensational!!!"
4,ruling metal,This album is great [..] and all but i still like the nephran ka album better this is true death metal u may not think so but i do u can judge me on that i really dont care anyway theirs this guy who calls himself fred durst number one fan or somethin and writes reviews on metal albums all he does is insult them espically some of the classic metal albums like megadeth [...] how do u like that fred dursts fan who listened to a cd for gay guys and thier gay dancing wat the hell ur a manly man fred dursts fan some metal head u are anyway u people might even like to check out morbid angel and fear factory and dark tranquility and machine head as well rock on people!!!!!!!
5,"Love it or hate it, we don't give a &#%!","I'm laughing, reading the 1 star reviews. That's always a good indicator of things. When it comes to something so subjective as music, you really have to make your own decisions folks.I've loved metal since I was 8 or 9. It took me a long time to warm up to the death grunt style of vocals but this album, particularly the song Sarcophogus, is what warmed me to the point that I love good death metal now. I can't say much bad about this album. Does the drummer have bad rhythm? Hell, I don't know, but it sounds amazing to me.Listen to samples. If you don't like it, don't buy it. Personally, I love this album but I admit, it took a while for the love affair to develop."
1,HUH?,"Dats what i sayed thro da whole albulm fellow metal headz. I cant here what day be saying. All dat i hearrr is Murrrrrrrrrrrrr GROWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLll MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR could someone pleez tell me what day be saying. Pluzzzzz thro a bunch of der songz i cant here da bass. if ya want some reall muzzzik listen to da old Bizzzkit, Korn, Parrrrrk, and Towwwwwwwwwn. but stay away from this."
1,"This drummer aint THAT good, check out Limp Bizkit instead !","The drummer is obviously lacking the talent and charisma that Talented drummers like Limp Bizkit and Linkin park.For good drumming metal also check out Nickelback, Disturbed, Lady gaga, and Pitbull."
2,What's with his voice?,"Thankfully I listened to the samples at amazon before buying this cd! What is with this guy's voice? If you're like me and find this ""death growling"" almost as annoying as rap, stay away from this band. Whatever merit the music might have is negated by the moron growling over top. Someone at the metal section recommended them as their favorite. The fact that he reminded me of ""bubbles"" from the trailer park boys should have tipped me off."
1,umm................................Crap,OK how can you like a bunch of screaming apes. ALl they do is grunt how can you enjoi music like that? If i could grunt and put it on a record and make money i would every member had no talent xcept for the drummer. If you want to waste a good 16 bucks on people grunting a screaming like apes be my guest but if you dont your making a good choice.
5,In Their Darkened Shrines=Perfection,"""In Their Darkened Shrines"" is the 3rd album from American death metal band, Nile. After succeeding their debut album with ""Black Seeds of Vengeance"", I doubted that they could once again out do themselves. Well it turns out that they have. Fusing Egyptian elements with modern death metal, Nile not only proves to be the most innovative death metal band, but the most ambitious and sophisticated. Nile challenges the listener with technical riffs, synth effects, variable drum tempos, and deep growls, many of which are spoken in Egyptian. ""In Their Darkened Shrines"" shows to be the epitome of modern death metal and an enjoyable listening experience."
3,On second thought...,"I purchased this after reading so many glowing reviews. While I don't think it's a bad album, and I agree that death metal albums often take repeated listens to 'get', I'll have to agree with the few who think the drummer SEEMS to overplay here, though fault actually lies in the MIX! He's amazing, and it's initially fun to have a band let the drummer act as a 'lead' player, but the drums are mixed so far up front that I often can't follow the guitar parts which are buried. And the almost constant, frenetic drumming style makes it that much harder to hear anything else. Still, the writing is elaborate and intense and this is just about as brutal a listening experience as it gets.(Many months later...)Turns out this is one of those cd's that took many listens to 'get' and I now find it terrific! In fact, their entire catalog is essential."
5,the blessed dead - live!,"in their darkened shrines is an all time metal masterpiece! i just saw these guys at bb kings in nyc for the art of noise tour part two with kreator, vader(rules!), amon amarth & goat whore. unbelievable! tony laureano was an absolute monster on the drums. the whole band wailed. i stood at the very front of the stage two feet from where dallas was shredding his guitar. the cd is fantastic and seeing them perform it live- the point on top of the pyramid!"
5,Nile gets MIGHTY,"With this album Nile is moving away from just plain brutal death metal and they are becoming an epic death metal band. A great example of Nile's new direction would be the song ""Unas Slayer of the Gods"" this is a 12 minute epic song. Compare this to the 2 minute songs on Amongst the Catacomb of Nephren-Ka and you'll see how much Nile has changed. Not to say, Catacombs is a bad CD, that is actually my favorite Nile CD, just because it is just so all out brutal. This CD really is great almost all the songs are very long and they each tell a story. The only problem is it can get tiring after a while, if you have a short attention span don't even bother with this CD, you will get bored quick. For those of us that can sit down and appreciate a good, long epic death metal CD ""In Their Darkened Shrines"" is for you. ""Unas Slayer of the Gods"" is a song that any death metal fan should hear whether they like Nile or not. STAY BRUTAL"
3,jumping off the zoya bandwagon,"I bought a bottle of Farah in the spring and used it once. It's now August and I opened it again and it's thick and syrupy - as if its been sitting around for years. Application was sticky and awful. It bubbled when it dried. I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon."
1,i must be missing something because THIS SUCKS,"i bought this because it got really great reviews, but no matter what formula i use (base coat/topcoat/timing), its too soft, and easily smudges. It also chips just as bad as $1 Brucci. Worse actually. I'm not impressed"
3,Ehh,NOt hte best for color match... pretty if you add a pearlized topcoat to it... Does not last if you don't have a top coat... Easily chips ( when topcoat is not present) Resembles paint... SHAY is better than the Minka
5,Zoya Noot review,Loved this product. The color was what I was expecting and the quality of the nail polish is great. Look forward to getting more Zoya polish in the future.
4,Zoya Storm,This was my first Zoya nail polish. The formula was good - 2 coats for complete coverage. The halo sparkles were more subtle than I expected and it does require a top coat to keep the glassy-shine. All in all a good polish.
1,Yellow Nails,"I got my nails painted with this at a salon and when I took the nail polish off, my nails where yellow! It took over a week for the color to go away and it really pissed me off. Don't waste your money on this."
1,old looking,This color looks pretty in the picture but it's very dark and old looking. I returned it. Google images the colors before you buy so you know what the true color looks like
4,Zoya Riley 453 nail polish,"Please stop complaining about the color of the product as it displays on your computer screen compared to the actual color of the product! Anyone who has ever bought an item online knows the little disclaimer that colors depicted online are not always true to the actual color.In this case, the written description of the color along with the image were helpful in choosing this item. I was happy with the ""Riley"" color, and the quality was satisfactory, too. My ""wear time"" before chipping was about five days, as other reviewers already noted."
5,"A cute, subtle nail polish","I bought the ""cassi"" pink nail polish. I don't really like wearing bright or flashy colors on my fingernails, so this was perfect. It gave it a nice subtle shimmer and a pale pink color. I just put one coat and it wore of naturally, rather than chipping. I'm sure for a more ""pink"" color i could have added another coat, but one was just perfect for what i wanted. Good quality polish for the color. I hadn't tried this brand before, but i wouldn't hesitate to purchase another."
1,Terrible,"This polish is awful. It somehow dries with smudges, even though I sat for an hour to let it dry and did not touch anything. Also looks bubbly when I look at it close up. Never again."
4,"Fabulous quality polish, but color is not quite as pictured","I know how fussy nail polish is to photograph, so I understand. However, I thought it was a pinkish hue when I purchased it. When it arrived I thought I'd received a different color entirely, as there is no pink at all in it. It is, however, a lovely coppery shade, just not what I wanted. The formula is fabulous, though, and I will definitely buy more Zoya in the future. The ordering process was easy, and the polish arrived quickly and well-packaged. I will definitely shop this seller again."
3,Not impressed.,I didnt like the thick way it went on or the way it peeled off The SAME day :( not happy with it
5,Fabulous within its genre,"This is bringing the sounds of the stadium right into your own home, for better or worse and minus the beer vendors (unfortunately). However, it's great to clean your house to, perfect for slam-dunk-the-wastebasket accompanient, and the absolute best thing to listen to before you run your first marathon. I'm surprised, yet pleased, to recommend it!"
4,Stylish and innovative,I really enjoyed the looking and reading the book. I'm actually going to stitch some of the scarves and shawls that are in this book. The book is very easy to read and follow as well as descriptive.
4,Terrific knitting instructions!,"I bought this book because I was taking a knitting class on Entrelac. The scarf included in this book gave very specific directions on exactly how to do this pattern. Unfortunately, a few directions were omitted but were easily added once my teacher pointed them out. Like everyone else, I noticed that the photos were fuzzy and unclear but I would still recommend this book."
5,Great book -- nothing wrong with the photos,Creative ideas for all tastes and level of skill. Clear instructions. Enough already with the comments on the photography -- most projects have at least 2 or 3 different photos and yes it is possible to have a good idea of the scarf pattern from the photos. I almost didn't buy the book because of these comments... good thing my curiosity won over my doubts!
5,Scarves Galore!,"This book is fun to peruse and dream through. There are some errors,but they seem to have been fixed in the newer version. I am on my second scarf from the book. No quick projects here. The good ones will take time and money.But these scarves has a classical quality about them."
4,"Great patterns, bad photos","There are so many different types of scarves in this book, you will be sure to find something great to make for yourself and all your friends as well! The patterns range in style from the slightly weird and funky (a turtleneck scarf/shrug and a colorful asymmetrical wrap, for example), to the classic beaded scarf and lacy shawl.The only complaint I have about this book is the bad photography. In many of the pictures, the model's face is in focus, but the scarf itself is blurry. It is very hard to see details in some of them, which I think detracts somewhat from the book's usefulness."
2,Not for Crochet-ers,While the book contains absolutely beautiful scarves - only 2 in the whole book are crocheted. I was disappointed.
2,"Interesting patterns, VERY bad photography...","When I purchased this book, I had read the reviews and noted a reference to ""bad photography."" Because I had Pam Allen's and Ann Budd's WRAP STYLE, which has beautiful photos, I thought the photography could not be too bad. Well it is TOO bad! I am an experienced knitter who does a lot of my own patterns and occasionally buy books to look at the photos for ideas and inspiration. Fuzzy photos of knitwear do NOT inspire!"
2,BLURRY PHOTOS! They need to overhaul it and publish a new edition!,"Yes, several of the patterns are innovative and inspiring, but the frustration of the photos just overrides any positives in this book. The models' pretty faces are in sharp focus; the scarves are usually obscured by a pseudo-artistic mist. If the publishers were professional and concerned about the needs of the people fabricating these patterns, you sure can't tell."
4,Great Scarves,"So if you're over the stage where you just buy yarn because it's so pretty and THEN have to figure out a pattern to use with it, this is a good book for you. It's got great patterns, most are pretty easy to do, and you can go buy yarn that the patterns call for, instead of the other way around, but you're not comitting to a full sweater and a couple thousand dollars."
5,Hubert's Best Solo CD,"I feel this is Hubert's best solo CD, the back-up band of Jimmy Vivino and the other guys on Conan O' Briens show give Hubert the room he needs to perform some unbelievable guitar solo's. The songs are all very different, but with the professional back-up band, Hubert's performance shines on every number. Definitely his best solo work to date."
5,Introducing standards to a new generation,"I've read many of the reviews posted here. I have seen Michael Amante perform several times, and I keep coming back to this first recording. At his shows, I am likely one of the youngest in attendance (that is not accompanied by a parent). I agree that Michael's style is somewhat pop oriented, and he may not be a true opera singer by exact standards, but I would have never been exposed to the beautiful and enjoyable music that is on this CD.Because of this recording, I have found the same music by ""great"" singers, only to loose the feel that I enjoy in this CD. For a true opera fan, I'm sure this is a pass. For a fan of the music and a more modern style, it's a must have."
1,Do I have to give him a star?,"It's amazing what you can achieve with a decent publicist and nice bone structure. You would get more for your money if you bought the poster instead of the CD. I've heard better singing in the subway, where I didn't mind donating my $.50 at all."
1,Another Bocelli?,"My husband says this guy is as bad as Bocelli, but I think he's actually a bit worse. In some ways we are grateful for these singers. I think that they help to introduce this gorgeous music to people who have never heard it before. It's such wonderful music that even in the hands of pop singers it makes an impact on people who think they don't like opera. The sad part is that there are a number of young tenors today who are not being recorded while the crop of thin voiced pop singers make best sellers. Ramon Vargas, Richard Margison, and Marcelo Giordani have such splendid voices and sing this music so beautifully, but do they get to record a La Boheme like Bocelli? If you like the music on this album, then please try a recording by Pavarotti, Bjoerling, or Gedda and hear this music as it is meant to be sung."
5,Frequently played and always enjoyed by all listeners,We have a second home about 3 hours from our primary home and frequently play CDs during our weekly round trip rides between the two.My wife and I have found this CD to be one of our favorites and have found it to be a safe choice when we have others in the car as well during this long drive.We have seen Michael Amante perform in person and think of him as the American Tenor or perhaps the Peoples Tenor.This album and his voice presumably cannot equal the power of a Three Tenors recording but it comes quite close and with pride in a native son we enjoy it as much.
1,Another poser!,"People, please spare yourselves! Don't believe the hype. This guy sings completely nasal, his technique is worse than Andrea Bocelli's, his talent is far under Michael Bolton's, and he is no where near as passionate as Pavarotti. If this stuff keeps on getting more and more popular, the next thing they'll have to come out with is a concert with Amante, Bocelli, and Watson. It would have to be entitled, ""The Three Wish-They-Were-Operatic Tenors."" That will be a sad day in all the world of opera!"
1,He isnt even Italian,"Micheal Amante isnt even Italian. He comes from a Polish background, which explains why he cant sing in Italian to save his life. I am not saying he is terrible. His pop stuff isnt bad. But leave the Opera to those who have studied it. Sometimes the words he sings in Italian sound like completely different words than how they were written. So in closing, if you buy this for opera, Dont!!!! If want to hear some decent pop songs go ahead."
5,mamma,I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE OF MICHAEL AMANTE I THINK HE`S GREAT. WHAT OTHER CD`S HAS HE RECORDED? THANK YOU JULIE BAIRD
2,Where's Charlotte?,"This was a real disappointment. First of all, Charlotte, having spent a large part of a previous book in France, then separated from Thomas while he worked in Whitechapel, is unceremoniously dispatched on holiday, where she does nothing except be rescued by a colleague of Thomas's. Without her, a dimension of the story is missing, and the fascinating insight into the Victorian class system earlier books provided.Another problem is by the extreme emphasis on the ""Inner Circle"" the book becomes fantasy rather than historical fiction. It also seems unfortunate to take Thomas from the world of crime into being an agent for the ""Special Branch,"" which is supposed to track Fenians and anarchists, but seems devoted to seeking out the Inner Circle.I wish the author would go back to those things that made the earlier books in the series so fine."
4,An easy-chair read...,"""Southhampton Row"" by Anne Perry was a novel that I enjoyed. The characters were sort of laid back, but sometimes, I like that in this type genre. The dialogue flows smoothly, and the plot, though somewhat predictable, still interesting enough. Nice Job!John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc."
3,Strong Female Presence Missed,"There is a lack of a strong female presence in this novel and it is the weaker for it. Charlotte and Gracie (a delightful character I wish we saw more of) are sent on holiday only to be ""rescued"". The use of the Inner Circle as a plot device (again) is not particularly original. The novel leaves you lacking a sense of closure. Good enough read, but not the best of the series."
3,MTV party cd,"I was hoping that this was an old CD i once lost, but it wasn't, its got some songs i know and some i don't. I got 1 song that i was really after so its ok."
4,Too many stories but good,Enjoyed this until the last story. It felt so different from the first few that I had a hard time getting started with it. I liked how the first stories progressed comfortably to each story. Characters mentioned then came to life in the next stories. The last one was to far in the future and now real connection to the previous stories other than the town.
1,Kindle version is poorly edited,"I looked forward to reading this Linda Lael Miller book. I generally enjoy her books, however, the Kindle version of this book is so poorly edited that it made reading it a chore. For example, in Jessica's story Galloway and Calloway were both used for Gage. So what was his name, really? More than once Jessica thought she might ""the"" rather than ""die"". Really? Punctuation was lost in many sentences. What happened to this book? It was a disappointment"
4,An enjoyable series...,"I enjoyed the Springwater Seasons but I missed the action. You only saw one bad guy in this series & it still lacked the adventure that I was looking for. It was nice watching this town blossom in these books but I still would've liked some excitement. If you are looking for a nice, quick & easy read then this is a good series. If you thrive for a hot steamy romance or a little mystery in your books then you need to pass on this series."
3,OK Album but Drum Machines Take Away From Vocals,"Good Music Good Singing Good Writing. Not sure if they actually used a drum machine or a drummer on a digital kit. Either way, I missed the drums. Smoooth Soul."
2,One controller does not work!,One of the controllers (King size bed) only has one temperature (very hot)no matter where you set it. We have asked for and are waiting for a return tag from Amazon. The other side works fine. We like the idea but would like a product that works.
4,Good but...,"This is a rather good book. Good review of grammar using idiomatic vocabulary items, with exercises. One thing I noticed were various typographic errors. This became rather irksome."
5,Patak Eggplant Relish,Excellent relish. Called chutney in North India. My family was delighted to discover Patak's line of products when we came to the States. Spicy without being too hot. Flavours are authentic.
2,'80's Retro,I purchased this book thinking the patterns were recent. These patterns could be considered vintage or early 80's retro. It's great if that's what you're looking for. I was disappointed.
1,Tarkan is MUCH better,"Wow. Can't say I mind the song all that much, but it just reminds me of another little girl having to show off her body to be popular. But putting that aside, The original by Tarkan is just wayyyyyy better. Sure, it's in Turkish and you may not understand a word of it, but his voice and musical talent will draw you in anyway. Some reviewers have said that Holly Valance is the reason for Tarkan's success with this song, but that is a bunch of bull...Tarkan is successful without the little blonde bombshell."
2,not recommended for people looking for original music.,"why?because for ur information the song was covered by 2 different female singer under the same title.kiss kiss.one by stella soleil and the other one is of course holy valance.Just like stella soleil holly valance will definately be a one hit wonder.if u like this kinda music,dont waste ur money on this junk.get the original version of simarik(original song by tarkan).Believe me, its worth every penny u spent on his album.well, maybe u buy holly valance for her good looks, then its definately a bonus for u aswell since tarkan looks better than her in every way, music,physical and most importantly originality.Maybe u dont wanna buy his album since its not made in america album, well ur on the rite track since his self title album that has 'simarik' on it was release in the USA by universal music america."
1,Holly S to the H to the I to theT.,"This is just a copy on the turkish singer Tarkan's 1998 hit ""Simarik"" i were in turkey during that time and the song was played everywhere to later become a smash hit in the rest of europe too. Even though it was in turkish it sold well casue it was a good catchy pop song with oriental influences. There is no need for Holly Valance to make a cover of it in english just a few years after. The lyrics are dull and the whole idea of it the song is annoying, Her next song called ""Down Boy"" really proves how much talent she got(Not). The mysterious ""one hit wonder"" has caused a new victim."
5,Fillion and Sackhoff,"Nathan Fillion and Katee Sackhoff, thats neat ! It was a fast paced cool movie with the top reps from Firefly and Battlestar doing something different."
3,This was better than the first one,I thought Nathan Fillion did a good job and this movie had decent special effects and story. Plus it was in Dolby True Hd and sounded awesome!
2,not what I expected,"this movie is not even close to the first one, the story line of way off and the idea sucked."
3,Not Particularly Original,"Aside from a few "" jump outs "" it's not really scary , It's ok to watch if you have nothing better to do ."
4,White Noise 2,"I don't normally like scary movies too much anymore, but I did really enjoy this one. It does keep you on the edge, and it held my interest through the whole movie. I highly recommend it. Thank you, Linda P"
4,Nice surprise...,"Considering the flood of direct-to-DVD horror movie sequels, this one floats to the top. The original theatrical film with Michael Keaton left something to be desired, however, this new flick gives the titular paranormal theme a boost. You just have to keep your EVP's and NDE's in order as you make sense of the plot and all the religious subtext. My guess-- this could have been an unrelated stand-alone screenplay that was adapted to fit the ""White Noise"" genre. Katee Sackhoff does a great turn as the love interest, and fans will remember her from her initial foray into horror fromHalloween - Resurrection. In all, this could spawn a third sequel if the present filmmakers sign on for another go round. Since it seems horror fans will devour anything that has competent and creative effort behind it (even if it doesn't hit the theaters), we may be seeing more films like this hit the shelves and not the cineplexes."
3,I was surprised....,"I'm not sure what made me decide to rent this movie because I didn't really like the first one, but I figured I'd give this one a shot because I happen to really like Nathan Fillion. I was kind of expecting it to suck as bad as the first one, but I was very surprised, this one is actually pretty good. Nathan Fillion's character has a near-death experience and from then on he has the power to ""see"" people who are going to die within the next few minutes. This movie definately has more scary parts than the first one, which I thought wasn't at all scary. It's not an excellent movie, but it is pretty good."
4,kING BRITT THE RENOWNED,"Some one gave a rating that was absolutly not true.. What are we talking about here is ..INNOVATION.. creating clear new music trails for those that like to feel the music, that like the inner movement that music causes. This is for you. just listen to the track Freedom. evocative and inspiring. This is exactly what moves me. Brandon Roberts Sagitariusrising@att.net"
2,Doesn't go anywhere,"This is one of four projects that King Brit has had his imprimatur on this year (incldng. Sylk 130, Scuba/Hidden Treasures and the Philadelphia Experiment remixed) -- despite all the hype from the underground press and the dodgy p.r about Obafunke (nee King Brit) not talking to the press for fear of losing his soul,there's not much going on here. Obafunke comes across as too much doodling and studio navel gazing - to my tastes, none of its ideas ever really come off -- it's all kinda dull and aimless. I have now come to expect a certain uneveness in KB's long players -- but this is not worth the fancy import price. Sample it somewhere first before you plunk your hard-earned doolos. In short -- nice concept but poor execution."
5,"Cuddlekin - 12""","Very soft, cute plush. They are not as large (chunky) as they appear in the pics, but are a good size for a child (or adult collector; they seem like they would sit on a shelf well). My 2 y.o. old son immediately fell in love with the baby black bear and has packed him all day! They each come with a small informative one-page booklet attached to their tag describing their particular characteristics and that's a nice touch."
3,Not Quite Wonderland,"""Jazz Portraits: Mingus in Wonderland"" is a good live album but not essential considering the plethora of other sessions available. Although this is a Blue Note CD, it was not originally recorded for the label in 1959. The band here is solid, with Booker Ervin leading the way, but it's not one of Mingus' best groups. The tunes are also good, but there are none of those characteristic Mingus blues-gospel romps that we've all come to know and love. For my money, other live recordings such as ""Town Hall Concert (OJC),"" recorded shortly before Eric Dolphy's tragic death, and ""At Antibes,"" with Bud Powell joining the band (!), are more legendary. Maybe some Mingus afficianados will like this album's change of pace, but I say start elsewhere."
4,Constructing Measures,"The book was required for a class I'm taking, it serves it purpose and got here within a reasonable amount of time."
4,Re1,It'll be even better if it took less time to be delivered. But overall it was good. The book is in real good condition.
2,A story of the people who came to America in world war 2,"This is not an easy reading book, is interesting in some parts and very boring in others, some part of the story could be real and some parts nobody will believe it, I think that in general is a heavy book, to read it you will have to have patient, I don't recommend this book for a plane or places that you want to read to be entertained with something like waiting rooms, etc."
2,Life is hell and then you die,"It's true that that the characters exist for the purpose of delivering long philosophical rants decrying thetheir existence along with everyone else they know. Of course this story takes place in the shadow of theholocaust which effects their every moment of their existence. It was understandably impossible for themto form relationships, or experience happiness based on the unspeakable trauma they experienced.They escaped the holocaust but the ghosts but they were driven by the ghosts of the past.This was a very heavy book and I felt relief when it was over. Would not recommend ifyou have a history of depression."
5,"Fearlessly honest, even about fear; true, and beautiful","Shadows on the Hudson is one of the best novels I've ever read. The people are real--and thank god, they're deeply sexual and deeply intelligent. Some readers are irked by the one, some by the other characteristic; by me a novel flops if the people are too dumb, or too free from the driving burdens and blessings of relentless sexuality. This more or less simultaneous wrestling with sex, faith and its lack, and the problem of theodicy (why God permits evil) is Singer's forte. Only Tolstoy does it better, but there is more real flesh in Singer, while the religious issues are at least as alive as those of Tolstoy's stellar episode toward the end of Anna Karenina, in which Levin successfully struggles toward theism. Singer's characters know what Tolstoy's don't: that 6 million Jews and 20 million Russians are gone who should not be gone. This novel is art, and monumental art; not another pleasure cruise for the beach umbrella."
4,unusual organization: soldiers by unit type...,"...or at least, this is the first book I've found that talks specifically in chapters about infantry, artillery, etc. (I'm sure others exist, but my reading has been eclectic.)I'm too much in awe of Keegan, and too poorly read in anything military *after* the 1500's, to attempt any real judgement on the scholarship here. (My credentials in military history are nonexistent; I'm just a reader.)I can say, however, that whatever its faults, I've found this book to be a valuable resource. The organization helps greatly when you want to know about, oh, pikemen. It did seem a bit Eurocentric to me, and I would have liked to see more inclusion of non-European unit types and *their* development, at least in the pre-modern era. Nevertheless, I'm happy I own this book...and it's staying in my collection."
1,Have some respect.,"This is not music. Have some respect. If you like this you are probably an idiot jock who thinks the middle east is somewhere near Kansas. Please America, wake up."
