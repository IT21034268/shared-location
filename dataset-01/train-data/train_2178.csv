1,KINDLE'S USELESS INSTRUCTIONS.,I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO READ THIS AS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK THE KINDLEPER THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST BOOK I BUY FROM YOU AS I HAVESHELVED THE KINDLE AND HAVE PURCHASED A NOOK WHICH PROVIDED STRAIGHT FORWARD INSTRUCTIONSAND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND A KINDLE TO ANYONE.
5,Smith and Wesson Collectors,If you collect Smith and Wessons you havee to own this book.No other book on Smith's is even close.
5,Smith & Wesson book,"This book is a must for Smith & Wesson collectors. My husband has spent hours reading it, looking for certain guns. It is a great book."
5,Smith & Wesson Info,A must have for anyone interested in Smith & Wesson revolvers. Well put together and easy to find the information you are looking for. I can't believe how much information is in this book. I should have bought this years ago.
3,Smith & Wesson Supica,"The text is too brief on important subjects and is incomplete on related items such as certificates, manuals, boxes and options."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is creationist propaganda. It attempts to look like a legitimate ""tribute"" film, and it starts out by making Darwin seem genuinely curious and intelligent, but that's just to draw you in. Before you know it, the creationist ""alternative explanations"" start creeping in, telling you the earth isn't really all that old, that certain parts of the body couldn't have been created by natural selection, etc.See this article for specific misrepresentations, along with refutations by people who are well-versed in science history: [...]"
1,A Sneaky Creationist Video which rewrites history!,WARNING! CREATIONIST PROPAGANDA WARNING! CREATIONIST PROPAGANDA WARNING! CREATIONIST PROPAGANDA WARNING! CREATIONIST PROPAGANDAI started watching this hoping to learn something new aobut Darwin but by the time I was half way through it I was sensing that something wasn't right with it. The evolutionary facts that I know well were suddenly being 'suspended' and 'opened for reinterpretation'. The word 'creationism' was in my mind by the time it was 3/4 through. I can't believe I have just been 'conned' into giving these nutters my hard-earned cash.DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO UNLESS YOU WANT TO FURTHER A CAUSE WHICH DARWIN WOULD HAVE REELED AT. DARWIN WAS ABOUT EVIDENCE. THIS VIDEO IS DECEITFUL. I'M AN ATHEIST BUT IF I AM WRONG AND THERE IS DEFINETELY A DEVIL OUT THERE THEN THE CREATIONISTS PERSONIFY HIM.
2,Don't be fooled!!,"I watched this video and it is nothing but another attempt by the Creation ""Science"" community to pass off their ID ""theories"" as reality TV. It is based on unsound concepts, with no basis in scientific concepts.The filming is well done (that's why the 2 stars) but don't kid yourself, this is just another attempt to dress up ID in a new set of cloths."
1,Creationism and an insult to Darwin!,"Be aware. This dvd promotes the so called ""intelligent design"" theory disguised as a scientific documentary. The producers are ""Creation Ministries International"". I recommend ""Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life"" hosted by David Attenborough instead."
1,Rubish creation spin,I would urge you to stay away from this vid! I thought maybe it would be a nice way to visualize Darwins life. WRONG! It was full of scientific spin to the creationist point of view. It had gross in-acurate information about Darwins life and work! Tried to contact the company and get a refund and was promptly yelled at and verbally abused over the phone by an individual at creation ministries! Nice christian attitude! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!
5,Wow!,"What a stunning production! Excellent from start to finish. Even my wife loved it, and she's always complaining about the low quality of most creationist videos. This one may as well have been produced by National Geographic...the film is literally that good!"
4,Bizarre,"Hot Air Head is something like an amalgam of Mr. Bungle and the Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack. This guy sounds alot like Jack Skelington, if you know what I mean. Anyone who's into eccentric, unconventional music should give this a try. Clever lyrics and jarring, cavorting rhythms ricochet from one end of your head to another when listening to this. It's a very interesting disc. Welcome to the Zoo, 10,000,000 Bloodshot Eyes, and Momma's Killing Daddy are the best tracks."
5,Rejoice in the Hereafter,"What a beautiful book! I enjoyed reading this very very much. I cried and chuckled. It's a very positive experience. Granted, it would help if you're LDS to read this and more open-minded. The Spirit will touch your heart while reading this book, if you allow Him to. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in knowing what Paradise looks and feels like. It's an amazing journey. I can hardly wait... ;-) God bless all who read this. P.S. THANK YOU, Suzanne, for sharing your sacred story with us. So many people do not share their stories because of the lack of faith & belief soooo many people have in this world - especially in these latter-days - but I, for one, believe the words of this book and rejoiced in reading it."
2,disappointed,"The book was nice, but I had problems with it because she is Mormon. Some of her experiences were scriptural, but a lot of things in the book didn't agree with the bible, or my beliefs."
3,Enjoyable...but,"I enjoyed this book. It was very spiritually uplifting. The problem I had was that there were aspects of it that made me wonder how true it was. When I read that she askes to not remember her experience in the afterlife, but some years after began to remember it all-- I was not sure how valid it was. The memory was TOO detailed and too popular docterinal to believe at times. I read this book after reading 4 other books on these kinds of experiences. While I really enjoyed it and it was reafirming to my faith. I take some of it with a grain of salt-- and hope that it is all real and true. But the validity of it caused me to question some of it."
4,Realistic Congo,"An interesting work about still wild and not much known part of highland war-turned Eastern Congo, professionally depicting rainforest populous -both locals and a broad range of animals (recently engaged as gigantic gorillas and some already extinguished), is really an example of classic naturalist movies, given then filmmaking technique especially.Perhaps, it might be placed in line withLegong - Dance of the Virgins,for instance, for great anthropological value to generations oncoming."
1,Terrible Quality,"The quality of this dvd is so terrible is virtually unwatchable. I dont know how many times it may have been transferred from the original film, but the color, saturation and sharpness are just awful."
3,"More Money, More Problems","I thought I would dislike this novel based solely on the first half. It was slow and drawn out and I almost put it down and that is why I give it only three stars. Luckily I didn't throw this novel to the side because the second half was banging. Lies, fame, drugs, deceit, sex, and murder. Lots of it. This book is a tangled web and I couldn't wait to see what the outcome would be. This slow starting novel turns into a bona fide page turner. I am very happy that all the loose ends were tied up at the end of this novel because I wouldn't be able to bear a part 2."
5,This Book was DOPE!!,I really liked this book! Thomas Long did his thing! He represented B-More like no other. Scar got what he deserved in the end and so did L-Boogie. You don't do your friend like that. Karma is real and Thomas showed it in this book!
3,What's it like to live on death row?,"Who are the inmates and what brought them there? What aretheir final moments like before and during their executions?This book gives an insightful look into life on death row andis often very explicit. The first half of the book almost sympathizeswith the condemned, while the second half includesthe biographies of many current death row inmates.It gives those of us who are law-abiding citizens a glimpseinto a very different world: a world where people chose to livetheir lives drenched in evil and now must reap what they've sowed.Not for the squeamish!"
5,best darn air filter you can buy for vehicle,"I have K&N; Filters in all my vehicles and motorcycles. They are great.... you can clean them, recharge them, and put them back on....You can physically hear the vehicles breathe better"
5,Great Product,"These filters are fantastic. I have them on my current vehicles and used them on my 5 previous ones. They have consistenly added at least 2 miles per gallon to my average fuel consumption. It is easy to see at the cost of fuel how quickly they pay for themselves. Also, they basically have a 100,000 mile guarantee so, you probably won't have to replace them. I haven't nor have I had to reoil one. It is much cheaper to burn air than gas. The price from this site was the best I found anywhere."
1,Don't use this filter,"About a month ago I installed this filter on my CT200h. I immediately saw a decrease in both performance and milage. The problems continued until I reinstalled the factory filter. The performance is back and, based on preliminary info, so is the milage."
4,Air Filter,This is one of the first items that I upgraded on my truck and I am seeing a little better gas mileage from this. It is a pain in the butt to clean and re-oil but I guess its worth it.
4,Always worked before,"I have used these on other vehicles with no problems. Like the fact you can go a lot of miles before cleaning. The cleaning process is a little hassle, but I just like the fact that you don't have to throw them away like the paper filters. Do they improve mileage and or Power. That remains a question mark for me. If they do it is not by a lot as far As I can tell. Not really the reason I buy K&N."
3,Not bad but a few complaints,"I like the feel of it and the different spray patterns but not the best for car washing. Every time you drop it on the ground it turns on and gives you a shower! Also, I'd rather have one with a trigger so you can keep the same spray and just turn it on and off without changing the pattern every time you open it up. Prob better for gardening than car washing."
3,Live In Japan,9 Tracks - 60 min. With Teddy Edwards tenor sax and a rhythm section led by Cedar Walton on acoustic and electric piano. The tunes are all too familiar by now. Tell me something I don't know. More of the same can be found on Centerpiece 2
1,Misleading Title And Ridiculously Bad,"What purports to be a compendium of programming tips is really a badly done introduction to programming. For example, one of the early tips is: use comments. Typos abound in this book. It is also very specific to DOS. At least 2 of the tips are devoted to the Goto statement (in C!). Avoid this book like the plague."
5,Best boot grease I know of.,"After many years working outside year-round, I haven't found anything for leather boots as good as Huberd's. It's a conditioner and water-proofing agent. It's not always easy to find and I wish more places carried it. Forced to use other brands, I was always disappointed. Kudos to Amazon for partnering with a company offering a simple, useful product that works great."
5,Awesome product,Everything with this product was awesome. I have enjoyed this product since i have received it. I was pleased with the shipping and information associated with the product.
4,Great Boot treatment,"This dependable shoe grease is a great product. I have used it for 30 years. My only concern is that it leave your boot greasy and you must be careful not to wear them inside on your carpet. They can leave a residue that is tough to clean up. On the boots it waterproofs, and softens the leather. You can't ask for a better boot treatment..."
2,The Stewardesses 3D - Kind of,"I had a girlfriend that booked movies in San Francisco, and I got to see this movie when it first came out. The 3D was amazing for 1969!! However, when I got the movie - with the red and blue glasses - one of the early scenes where legs go flying past your head was just not the same. The original movie used Polaroid glasses, like Disneylands Michael Jackson movie. So the 3D is just so so, and the plot is fair. Lots of female nudity, so not for the young ones."
3,This movie Is a Hoot!,"Back in the 80's a theatre in nyc had a 3d film festival that showed 3d movies from the 1950's to the 1960's. I was lucky enough to see The Stewardesses. What I remember most was that the audience was screaming with laughter at this movie. This movie is the perfect talk back to the screen movie. This is a cheesy soft porn skin flick in 3d, and I loved every minute. I just got the dvd yesterday and watched it again for the first time in years, and it has not changed a bit. I remember the scene the audience went wild over. It was right at the beginning when this girl and guy are making love in a motel room, and the girls feet and legs are going back and forth at the screen. Restoration is good. 3D is fair. It works well in somes parts, but not in others. Take this movie for exactly what it is, a look back at the very early stages of what would become the golden age of porn. This movie can be very sexy."
4,Campy but fun,"Wasn't around when this came out but glad I am here to see the new release. This was honestly a horrible film but being that most of the scenes were ad-libbed was honestly funny. Verry funny indeed. It just works. The 3-d in anagliph doesn't work very well but for depth-of-field works. Out of screen effects don't really work but are noticed. Still, for a bad movie, this one is just a ride at the funpark you have to take. Bad but good in every sense."
4,stroll down memory lane,"I bought this because I saw the original MANY years ago. Nostalgia! Truly a ""soft porn"" movie. The trip was good but the 3D was weak. At the price thogh, I'd buy again."
2,Not worth the price.,"I understand this was a cult film, but it still lacked anything for me. The 3-D glasses were a pain to deal with and did not give me a 3-D effect at all."
1,Very bad!,"Poor quality, acting and story line. Sex scenes were campy and fake. A waste of money. The 3d was funny at times."
2,The Stewardesses 3-D(1969),"The Stewardesses 3-D(1969) is a sexy comedy/drama starring Christina Hart and directed by Alf Silliman Jr. It's packed with sexy women, nudity and 3-D effects. Then again, it has almost no plot or story. The budget for the film was $100,000 and it grossed more than $25 million at the box office. There are several alternate versions of the film. The film is a part of pop culture. It was spoofed on SCTV. The Stewardesses was one of the first movies filmed in Stereophonic 3-D. Many Hollywood 3-D movies were filmed in Anaglyph 3-D. This Shout Factory DVD does deliver in quality. The film claims that it was based on a novel, but that is not true! The film has many filler scenes. People play pool or have fun at a carnival. A stewardess gets high on LSD and tries to make love to a lamp! This film is for adults only. The Stewardesses 3-D is so bad, it's good."
3,Very slow,I had a very hard time getting into the story. I did love little Lark and kept cheering for her and the dream of the house that she wanted. I did want Lark and her Mother to get away from her father. If the story moved a little faster and was a little less choppy with fewer characters it would have been a better story. The story is sweet just not an easy read.
4,At first I wasn't sure,I wasn't sure why all the accolades for this modest book but once I got further along the book my respect began to build. I read it in 3 days and didn't want it to end. This was like comfort food once I got into it.
5,A wonderfully written rich and honest novel.,The Cape Ann is the story of life seen through the eyes of a little girl. It's an honest story that touches on all human emotions. It is an incredibly rich story which will make you want to laugh out loud in some parts and cry in others. A truly touching novel.
3,"A difficult beginning, intriguing point of view","I had a hard time getting into this one. It didn't really hold my interest until about halfway in. I did find the 6-year-old point of view delightful; the misunderstood adult references were ""laugh out loud"" funny."
1,A-Line Border Print skirt,"Thin, cheap material, poorly sewn, poorly constructed and screen printing was second rate. The sizing was off by at LEAST 2 sizes. Whole product was cheap looking."
1,Deceptive,"This skirt looks beautiful in the photo. That's the only thing I can say that's good about it. The skirt is poorly made and the material used feels cheap. The fit is really strange, I'm not sure if it's that it's too small or the way it's put together. I will never buy another skirt online. This really taught me how important it is to try things on before I buy them."
4,Nice for the price,"These aren't the finest cashmere ever, but for the price, they're great! I have 7 different colors/patterns and wear them all Fall and Winter. I've even given away several as gifts and they were well received. The Venetian Red is especially nice during the Holidays. I've quit wearing my expensive cashmere, since these work well, I'm not afraid I'll ruin them and it's fun to have the variety. I store all ""wools"" in zip-lock bags, so moths and silverfish don't eat them. I'll probably buy more of these."
4,SAVED ME IN ASPEN!,"I got two of these very soft and warm. I got this is an early xmas gift. then, on my b-day I went to Aspen. these scarfs not only look great. but, saved me from freezing out in Aspen XDBRING ON THE GREAT SCARFS SAKA'S I'LL ONLY BUY THESE FROM YOU! THERE AWESOME!5 stars,... oops. how do I change the 4 star to 5.anyway.. there 5 not 4."
5,Excellent,The product I bought from Amazon was excellent and I like it very much.My trip to Indiana I enyoied a lot with this item.Manchester United Soccer Team Scarf
2,"I expect more with a ""cashmere"" label","Yeah... it's soft, but so are a lot of things. Unfortunately, this scarf is nothing special. It DOES look like felt. I now have to find something else to give for Christmas. A disappointment."
2,Not Satisfied,"I bought this scarf in black for my boyfriend as part of this year's xmas gift to him, thinking it would be a good buy considering its rave reviews. Two reviews stated it looks cheap and like felt, which made me worried, but I got it anyway.I have to say that they are right. It's soft to the touch but thin and stiff when you wrap it around your neck. The length is short and awkward for such a stiff fabric, and it really does look like it had been cut from felt. Definetly looks cheap. That's too bad because I think the color is rich and deep, just honestly NOT worth the price (with s&h;, came out to be $33.97). I am returning this as soon as possible and I'm looking for a better quality scarf for this price. I know good cashmere when I see/feel it (I own 3 cashmere Burberry scarves myself) and this is not it."
4,Good but maybe a little random?,"I see a lot of mixed reviews and I think I see why. I ordered 3 scarfs and this is what I got:1 pink - nice quality, has a label that says ""100% Cashmere"" on it.1 white - nice quality, also had the label1 black - no label and seems to be lower quality than the pink and white ones, almost like it's a different material. The black one ""sheds"" a bit and just doesn't seem to be as tightly woven as the other two.So I think the bottom line is that for whatever reason, the quality on these scarves has some variance.Still, I like all of them, even the black one. They're all soft and warm and about, oh, 10?"" wide and a good 5+ feet tall so I can wrap it around my neck with plenty to spare and pull it up as a mask when the wind is really biting. The original list price makes me laugh but the sale price is quite reasonable and so far I'm pleased with them."
1,Not as I expected at all,"This was not the quality that I expected at all. It looked really cheap and I would not purchase again. Don't be fooled by the ""100% Cashmere"" the quality is NOT THERE."
3,"Cashmere Blend , Price Justified $27.99","I got 2 of these @27.99 ea, was very excited till i touched and wore them.Pros- well stitched, Color Choice, Good Feel, and Price Justified for less than $30.Cons - Not 100 % Cashmere, Not Branded, Glued Sticker labeled 100% Cashmere.Not recommended for you as 100 % Cashmere scarf"
2,Disappointed.. but at least black goes with everything,"The vendor should describe the scarf as made of a compressed felt material. It is soft, not like scratchy wool. It would be a gouge if it was sold at retail [....]. I'm not even sure if the price was even fair [....]. I lost my cashmere scarf on my last trip and hoped to replace it. This one was not even 1/3 of the quality of the one I lost [...]. Disappointing.. and I won't recommend anyone to buy it."
1,Not worth the money and beware of color,"This scarf is, I guess, okay. But you can get the same thing from a street vendor in New York City for $5.00. What intrigued me about the scarf was that it was describe as ""burgundy"" and I wanted to replace a deep cranberry colored scraf that I lost a few years back. As with all coloring on the internet, beware! The color is simply ""red."" No big deal. After buying the scarf, I saw a wool scarf in a second hand shop that is more to my liking for $8.00. The second hand wool scarf is also thicker than this so-called cashmere and, in my opinion, just as soft. This scarf is not worth the money."
5,Very Satisfied!,"The scarves arrived quickly and in the condition as described online. They look great, and feel very soft and of nice quality."
2,Cashmere Muffler,I did receive my muffler but not in the time I paid for. I paid for this to be shipped priority mail on 5th of Dec. and did not receive it before I left on the 15th. This was very disappointing and I am not thrilled with the service.
3,nice but no bargain,"I like my scarf very much, but it is no bargain. I see them cheaper in stores all the time now."
3,Spirit Lacking,"A serviceable translation, but lacking in spiritual depth. Thomas Merton's translation gives a much better appreciation of the spiritual depth of the text."
2,A. C. Graham,"This translation, I have to say, cannot hold a candle to A. C. Graham's. Graham reorganized the whole text, and explains how and why very methodically in his 35-page introduction. He tried to put the Inner Chapters into what could be (he believes) more faithful to the initial text. His translations read beautifully, much better than Hinton's often clunky ones. Also, when Zhuangzi switches from prose to poetry, or vice versa, it is noted in Graham's translation, often by putting the translation into a poem. In Hinton's, you'll find no such doings. Also, call me a snob, but I like my philosophy books to be translated by philosophers.I'm sure it's a fine book, but I really must strongly recommend the Graham translation over this."
3,"very nice, but not for making cultured vegetables","I like this bowl. It is well-made and attractive with a non-skid bottom. But I bought it as a mixing bowl for cultured vegetables before putting the vegetables into jars to ferment. The vegetables spoil during fermentation. I tried it twice, making sure nothing else could be causing the spoilage. The ""stainless steel"" quality of a mixing bowl used to make cultured vegetables has to be high; otherwise, this spoilage will happen, which is why most people use glass bowls or crocks. I expected more of this bowl than it delivers. On another site I read that bread mixed in this bowl will not rise. I would not use this bowl for marinating either after my experience, though marinated food would be cooked before there is time for spoilage to be noticeable."
5,Easy on the eyes...,"My husband thinks I am nuts for admitting this aloud, but I just love this mixing bowl!! Sturdy, not too heavy. This 5-quart is great for when I make meatballs and have four pounds of meat to mix up. I love the non-skid bottom, that feature works wonderfully. I own the OXO Softworks 2-piece mixing bowl set (possibly discontinued), which came in a blue and green color. They stack nicely inside of this 5-quart mixing bowl."
3,What's Your Sin?,"This movie reminded me of an erotic and less gory version of Hostile. Remember that movie where the wealthy could act out any fantasy they had? Those fantasies seemed to revolve around torture and murder, while in House of Sin sex is on the menu--and there's a huge variety! Why do I love Philip Gardiner films? He's living a dream, that's why. He has the ambition to follow what intrigues him and makes films from them. It's also interesting to see him ""grow"" over the years. His films get better, tighter, and more intriguing. I'm always wondering what he'll come up with next. House of Sin didn't disappoint me. There's enough eroticism without downright porn. It's eerie and weird, without making your stomach churn (which I felt while watching Hostile!) What would you do if you entered a house like this? What fantasies do you keep locked up? Or would it shock and disgust you to enter this home?"
4,Lots of sin,"It seems like a lot of the other reviewers have detailed out the plot so I won't go into all that here. I will say this is a movie that explores the desires that lie beneath the surface. Of course in any movie like this, there is a price to be paid, but I'll let you discover that for yourself."
3,An exotic ride,"This film was very racy yet, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole movie. Good plot, backed up by good acting led to an enjoyable movie experience."
1,disappointed before trying the product,Got strong truffle smell before opening Amazons box - the jar was not closed properly.You Cannot Sell Spices In Non-hermetically sealed jars!!!
3,INTENSE aroma and flavor,"I picked this truffle salt because of the user reviews. When I opened the jaw, the aroma was like a brick in the face. I thought that the flavor was going to be watered down, but couldn't be wrong.I read that it was great on eggs, so I took a pinch and added it to my eggs. When I took a taste I nearly vomited. I may have added too much, or may be like the husband of another reviewer. This may be just a flavor that is a love it or hate it. I REALLY wanted to love this stuff, but it's just vile to my taste buds.I gave it 3 stars because I want others to know that they may be cursed with my genetic taste buds. I envy those of you that love it!!!!!"
2,truffle salt,"When I look at the label it says 5% truffle so 95% salt. It smells mostly like salt. It looks mostly white, with specks of dark spots. So you are basically paying for the salt. Like someone said I would need at least 10%.I do not like the real thing concentrated but this is not enough. I would have to add some myself. It tastes OK if you like salt."
5,Great product and great seller,"I had a problem with my first order,but I didn't contact the seller. Instead, I left bad seller feedback. The seller (The Frenchy Bee) immediately contacted me and resolved the problem in a very professional manner. I should have contacted the seller before leaving the feedback. I learned a lesson.The salt is awesome. I haven't had the opportunity to use it much. So far, I have used it in scrambled eggs and I have sprinkled it over pasta. It really enhances food. I don't use very much of it, since it is quite fragrant. The taste is earthy, but subtle when used in moderate amounts. I look forward to using this salt in many more dishes."
4,tasty,This stuff is great to make egg dishes special. It does add a truffle scent but you must cut down on adding other salt.
4,Very satisfied,"Pretty much what i expected. Tasty & aromatic. However will continue to look for a product with like 10% truffle content. This salt contains ""truffle essence"" aswell which makes me wonder if a good portion of the aroma flavor comes from synthetic chemicals as found in other various mock truffle products. If that is the case, mehh whatever. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase."
2,"Weak, artificial flavor, seal broken","I am a truffle lover, and am disappointed by this product. In addition to the actual truffle, it has artificial flavor in it, an ingredient not listed above. It is not as strong as previous truffle salts I've had.To add to this, the seal was broken! I'm going to try to return this."
5,Dostoevsky like - a tight psychological portrayal of a troubled man.,Dostoevsky like - a tight psychological portrayal of a troubled man. John Hopler is a man you won't forget. Highly recommended.
2,Grandma's Bibble,"I ordered this toy for myself because I enjoyed the character in the movie so much. I love her; she's a real *mood enhancer*. I only wish she *said* more things, and that what she did say was more legible."
4,"Great toy, but $45, you've got to be kidding!!!","What is with the high price of toys on Amazon? My daugher and my son(age 4 and 2) love this. From a parents point of view, its cute, and not annoying. But for $45.00? way over priced. Try wal-mart."
5,Here's The Story,"Ok, here's the story. This. This is mother^%&#ing wishbone. He doesn't care about your rules. He doesn't care who you are. Wishbone is going to do what he wants, when he wants, wherever he wants and you can't stop him, got it? He's been fighting the power since 1995 and he's not stopping now. You want Robin Hood? He's got it. You want dogs dressed up in Robin Hood outfits with a bow that he can never actually use? Look no further. If you want to see a Jack Russell Terrier wrestling with serious moral issues and finding his identity in the end, then I have the story for you. It's Wishbone. And you can run and tell THAT."
5,Good Book,"Excellent business book! It doesn't bog down with traditional jargon or flashy catch phrases; rather, discusses leadership in the first person."
4,Other Books,"This is not a bad little tome.Scalzi takes a pretty even-handed look at the movies, giving a literature background to start with, an introduction to films, and then listing his 50 important selections.He also takes a look at tv, music, and important figures or characters from the various productions. He even mentions novelisations which he thinks are good (ET, and Buckaroo Banzai) and the Abyss, which I don't remember reading if I did, but I agree with the first two, and am still looking for a copy of Buckaroo.Also a section on non-English films.If you are quite familiar with all this already, you don't need this book, as you will have seen all of them and know most of it, barring the odd Mexican wrestler movie perhaps. Even so, it would be a useful reference, and certainly excellent as an introduction to those that are new.It is also an annoying odd square shape to some degree."
4,"Worth owning, but get his other books first.","I really like John Scalzi's work.If you haven't read Old Man's War, you are missing a treat.This is not a bad guide, and Mr. Scalzi's humor and wit come shining through. The edition I recieved is full of typos that seem pretty glaring, and I found them extremely distracting.I enjoyed this book very much overall, but don't make this your frist Scalzi purchase. Get Old Man's War first!"
4,"Fun, as such things go.","A fun overview of the history and evolution of science fiction movies. It is entertainingly written and Scalzi isn't shy about saying this is a good movie and that isn't, this worked, that didn't, and these are so bad they're still worth watching just for laughs. ""Sci-fi"" is rather loosely defined, with quite a few fantasy (usually darker fantasy) movies included."
5,Great Condition /Fast Shipping,"Thank you so much! I have been told that this book was out of print and that it wasn't going to be sold again. A friend told me to check Amazon because they have everything. She was on point! This book looks brand new no marks, wears, or highlights that I have seen so far. I have to tell the rest of my classmates to check here because of the pricing is great."
2,"Modern, Cold Office Design","Another cold, stark, and often not human-friendly portfolio of office architecture and space design.Where are the revamps of 50, 100, or 200 year old buildings? Where's the warmth and character?"
5,What's Happening in Office Design,"This beautifully illustrated large book shows what's happening in club/discotheque design. Like a lot of the daab books, it basically has no text. Instead it is a collection of high quality photographs showing the latest trends in club design from around the world. And around the world really means all over the world vrom Brazil to Peru, Japan to New York, all over Europe, behind the old Iron Curtain, Israel and more.Clubs seem to go through styles. From the original dingy cellers to high style, then back to the celler with the warehouse look of exposed beams and utilities, and more recently to a wide variety of styles that combine nearly any look from living room, to theater, to cave.Consider this as an idea book for club design. It's what the top designers around the world are doing these days."
4,Something New,It opens your mind to explore different ways to view music. It is not so much as an instructional video as a philosophy of music. I would recommend this to any one who comfortable playing and wants to grow more.
5,Amazing,Victor Wooten is simply one of the most talented bass player and musician alive!! A new approach to understand music and grooving!
4,Fun video,"This video will have you thinking in a different way about music. It goes through some of the subconscious aspects of performing while skipping the didactic aspects of learning bass. I would rate this video intermediate because it doesn't teach you much about actual music, just playing it better."
1,"bell ok, fastener isn't","I was very pleased with the speed and accuracy with which this order arrive. Everything looked nice and the bell had a nice sound and loud enough i could here in on the tiny deaf dog who was wearing it so i could find him as he couldn't hear me call. However the fastener kept coming undone, and the bell has come off several times. My dog just came inside....without his bell again. Hope i can find it."
1,Where is it???,"Ordered this item on Jan 19th 2006, it hasnt even been shipped yet apparently. I ordered it along with a Book on UML which was supposed to be shipped out in 1-2 days which hasnt been shipped out yet either. Didn't expect this from amazon."
4,An unusual and powerful book,"This is an (at times) painfully honest and true story. On the surface, it's about Anderson's war time experiences as a free lance photo-journalist mostly in Bosnia but also in Chehnya.This is a very personal account, really a memoir. Anderson is very open about his heroin addiction, and his addiction to the experiences he encounters in the Balkans. You cannot help but be deeply affected by his writing, his experiences, and his honesty in sharing these with the reader."
2,good start however boggs down with self-absorption,"Great subject matter with tremendous potential to captivate the reader.Unfortunely, the author misses the track. Anderson's knowledge of the subject matter is challenged when he decides to make Kurdistan a country rather than the ethnic region that it is. The sojourn to Spain is painfully contrived and tends to ramble. The final epiphany is lackluster at best and reflects the nonsensical description of Colin's death."
4,great resource for creating stencilled trompe l'oeil,"This is a terrific resource for getting you started on trompe l'oeil stencilling. The book has MANY photographs and drawings to illustrate technique and finished objects and, after several introductory chapters that focus on the use of stencils and paint effects, is organized into a series of projects. Within the context of these seven specific projects the author describes various techniques, such as using a multi-overlay stencil, shading, stippling, creating woodgrain, pitfalls to avoid, freeform stencilling, etc. Each project is accompanied by a pattern that can be enlarged on a photocopier and then used to make the stencils you'll need to complete the project. The projects described are a rose border, teddy bear, keys, grapevine, shelf with crockery, umbrella plant and marble fruit bowl."
1,Very poor Pruduct,"CABLES ARE NOT INCLUDED. when switch is activated, loss of OS discovery of mouse and/or monitor can occur. Loud beeping when switching. Over all a very poor KVM"
5,Great for Kitchen,These shears will cut anything and are very sturdy. I really like that they come apart to be washed thoroughly. Great product.
2,"Sharp shears, but they rust...","My initial impressions were great. The shears were sharp and the handles fit my hand, but then they started to rust at the pivot. I've always hand washed these shears and dried them with paper towels. I've never had any of my knives or shears rust before, so this is a complete surprise. Needless to say, I'm unhappy with this product."
4,scissors,"They're red, which is nice, and have a cool non-slip handle. I don't think they would cut pennies or anything, though."
3,"Sharp, but plastic looks cheap",Sharp. Black plastic does not look good though. I am not sure about durability of that plastic staff that connect two parts together either. Time will show.
2,Beware how you use this!,"It works fine if you only charge 2 AA cells at a time. If you try to charge 4 AA cells, it will destroy the power supply (at least that's what the one I got does). I ruined two 12V 1000mA power supplies - the one that came with it, and another that I had on hand - before I figured out what was causing it. If it will only charge 2 AA cells at a time, why did they build it so it will hold 4?"
2,"Engaging writing, shallow story","While Marcuse is a fairly decent writer, this story is shallow and underdeveloped -- no wonder, considering the book is a slim 288 pages. The mystery plot in itself all right, but all the characters that populate it are all stereotypes -- e.g., holier than thou Jews; overly friendly Witnesses; people who moved to New York from other states; and gay, pretentious artists -- and we never really find out out people's motivations for what they're doing, particularly when they seem to be violating their own religions' dictates. This book reads like it was written by someone who's seen a documentary about life in Brooklyn rather than someone who's lived it."
5,the 'right' are wrong,"Bob Woodward's claims in his book are being refuted by the White House. He didn't become one of our nation's pre-eminent journalists for nothing. He has hours of taped conversation and full transcripts to back up his claims, (including taped conversations with Powell himself). He said he will keep them private, but I'm sure, if push comes to shove, he will make them public to silence his right wing critics. He did not set out to bash bush, but was obviously very disturbed by much of what he saw and heard first hand in the administration.""To announce that there must be no criticism of the President. or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is treasonable to the American public."" (Theodore Roosevelt ""editorial"", Kansas City Star, May 7,1918)A republican president no less."
5,Balanced Reporting,"Plan of attack seems to be a very thorough and balanced presentation of the process, which led up to the Invasion of Iraq. I say it was balanced because; I started reading the book with a very negative view of President Bush and finished the book with a higher opinion of him.The book gives a lot of information about the planning process, which was started by Cheney and Rumsfeld as soon as they took office, long before the 9/11 attacks. The book also presents the efforts of Powell to arrive at a diplomatic rather than military solution.This book may become a future ""must read"" for understanding the Second Iraq War."
2,OK except for a serious editing flaw,"Plan of Attack adds many details about the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, although the emerging picture of the principals' role is in all essential points consistent with previously available information.Unfortunately, the work is seriously marred by the frequent and wholly gratuitous use of foul and offensive language. It is regrettable enough that national leaders, supposedly gentlemen, would revert to barracks speech when under great stress; but repetition in a work amenable to reflective editing lacks excuse."
1,IT'S ON BUSH'S RECOMMENDED READING LIST!,If Bush is recommending that everyone should read this book about himself I amagine he has a reason.I found it was a cover and an attempt to hide the fact that the invasion was planned in Texas long before W got to DC.
1,Only Republicans Need Apply,"I haven't liked anything woodward wrote since he produced the major trojan horse of the 20th Century in ""deep throat"". I don't believe much of anything he says and doubt really sincerely, after reading what supposed members of the cabinet were purported to say, that he ever talked to them. Bobby seems to have forgotten 9/11 and the fact that the US has remained safe so far under Pres. Bush's watch. Not to say it won't happen, but Bush is doing his best. bobby's keen sorties into political naughtiness only seems to emerge when Republicans are in office. How very odd and the trojan horse stays empty. There is no more there, there, if he can ignore the clintoon years, the carter mess, he has no prowness as an investigative reporter."
4,Right or left this is an informative read,"Woodward shows the President in a mostly favorable light. After watching 60 mintues I expected this book to be more anti-Bush propaganda. But was suprised, Woodward depicts Bush as a serious leader, surrounded by the best of the best, making difficult decisions to protect our nation and fulfill his duty as President. Woodward also highlights Bush's interest in the accuracy of the intelligence provided him by his intelligence services. Much was was made on 60 Minutes of Bush's desire to improve the lives of people around the world. The book showed this as well. Isn't that great? Is there a problem with this? You can be certain that if a democrat President said the same thing, he would be kissed on the forehead by a beaming Mike Wallace. Apparently the complaint isn't that a President might say or believe in the betterment of our world, but rather that he would take action to make it happen."
3,A Toothless Tale,"Yes, I am John Kerry supporter, let's get that out of the way first. I also admit that I wanted to read a more damning account of the events leading up to our Invasion of Iraq. My problem with Woodward's book is I feel he told the story fed to him by the White House, and I know the conversations we don't hear are much more telling than the ones Woodward relates. Tenet is the scapegoat, and everyone else participated in the willing suspension of disbelief. Mr. Woodward in his stretch for fairness and impartiality has lost his edge."
5,Plan of Attack,"Very well written, holding the reader's interest in every page.Mr. Woodward's reputation as an outstanding reporter is upheld. A must read for anyone interested in contemporary American poltics."
3,interesting draft,"Woodward here is getting a bit long in the tooth and in dire need of a stronger editor to parse away all the chaff and give a bit of focus. Instead we have to wade through a bureaucratic quagmire of point by point reconstructions of early meetings (and their minutes) and video conferencings, actual document headings and blah blah before the narrative finally picks up steam two hundred or so pages in. A younger Woodward did much better with similar material in The Commanders, on Gulf War 1."
3,AND THIS TOO SHALL PASS . . . . .,"Who really cares about this stuff? It's the same old playing politics left versus right that has always, and will always go on. It never seriously affects the lives of the overwhelming majority of us, although of course we all feel the greatest sympathy to the families of those that have fallen. At some point Bush and his cohorts will simply be history just like Clinton, along with their sins. Care about something that will really affect ALL of our lives big time. Read a book like THE GREAT BUST AHEAD by Arnold instead - if the inevitable thirteen year depression forecast, several times worse than the 1930s, beginning in just a few years, isn't more important than all this ""gotcha"" stuff, then we deserve what's coming down the pike at us."
2,Not a Woodward Style Book,"This account of the days preceeding war in Iraq is replete with unfounded generalizations about the principals and in fact, Woodward often assumed feelings held by certain principals as far back as 1989. Furthermore, Woodward's Bush At War was relatively objective and the writing was very lucid. This book on the other hand is clearly Woodward's attempt to determine the outcome of the November election at the expense of a portion of his reputation of being an objective, respected, insightful writer/journalist. This book would have been more interesting had Woodward relayed the account without such strong liberal undertones.Not worth the buy."
2,Disappointed,"Even Bob Woodword has lost his edge and has become a lapdog. This book should be subtitled: ""Bob Woodword Sells His Soul for Access."" He lets Bush off too easily and doesn't really tell us anything new."
4,Bob does it again,I found this book to be insightful of the white house and how it operates....Bob does a good job as always.
5,"Makes for interesting reading,",I ejoy reading all the political books. I find books like this gives most people something to chat about.
3,Tedious!,"As one who is about as pro-Bush as Michael Moore, I thought I would really enjoy this book. I was wrong. It is far too detailed for my taste. This makes for very slow reading. I am one of those readers who squeezes reading books in between working, reading news mags and papers, and watching sports on TV. When I find a book I consider interesting I put off the other things - except work, of course. This means I am only doing a few pages a day. Maybe it's me. I have about 10-12 unread books I want to get to. Maybe if I force myself. I am only a little more than halfway through so I may be rushing to judgment. Today, I am in bed with a bad cold so I might get more read. I almost wish I could quit in the middle but that might be doing the author a disservice. The last book I quit halfway through was The Hunting of the President but I may go back. As I said, maybe it's me."
2,Impeach Woodward,"Bob Woodward's been famous forever, of course, but I had never read anything by him until ""Plan of Attack"". Little did I know how lucky I was, because Woodward is an absolutely horrid writer. So horrid, in fact, that he made me forget what a ludicrious person George W. Bush is -- and that's not an easy trick, folks. So really what this hackwork boils down to is a piece of inadvertent Republican propaganda. Them conservative warmongers are clever little devils, ain't they?"
3,Plan of Attack,"In Plan of Attack, Woodward cleverly presents us with historical facts and memorable events. The book is very good and I enjoyed it very much. I also recommend USA THE MOVIE from manticeye.com. See it because it really makes an amazing viewing experience. I couldn't believe my eyes. From history, speeches to insanity and the mad world of politics. Happy reading and viewing!!"
4,the inside scoop,Mr Woodward presents the reader with the details that lead up to the BUSH jr war on Iraq. His access to the insiders shows us what can be done with thorough interviewing and skilled journalistic technique. This book reveals some of the flasw in the decision making and should hopefully show the reader how our leaders can fool eachotehr to 'coming on board'.
4,Real Story Behind Iraq!,This is an interesting coverage of the planning and thinkingbehind the decision to invade Iraq.Woodward tells about Secretaryof Defense and Vice-President Cheney being gung ho about going towar in Iraq.You are also told of Secretary of State Colin Powelland General Tommy Franks being hesitant about invading Iraq.Theauthor Woodward tells how intelligence provided by CIA directorGeorge Tenet pointed to the existance of Weapons of MassDrestruction.He also shows how this was used to justify invadingIraq.Woodward also tells how Bush was intent on toppling SadamHussein.This is excellent coverage of the arguments and planningthat led America to go to war in Iraq.A very interesting book.
4,Sequel,"After the 9-11 Atacks Bob Woodward wrote a book called 'Bush at War' about the war in Afghanistan. 'Plan of Attack' is the sequel, this time dealing with the planning of the war on Iraq. We get an in-depth view into the views of people like Rumsfeld, Powell and president Bush. Powell wants to use diplomacy as long as possible while the hawks in the cabinet are more ready to use force. It makes Bush look like a stronger leader than he is sometimes made out to be, if we can believe Bob Woodward however. There are no breaking stories in this book but I think it gives a great look at how the planning of a war works."
1,It never arrived,I still haven't received this book! I tried canceling it from the vendor because it was taking too long and my daughter no longer needed it for a school assignment but they told me it shipped already. That was over a week ago. Now I have to chase up this order.
4,"reader, commenting on comments","If this is all ""Lies from the Left"" as many reviewers are calling Woodward's book, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Very interesting reading."
1,Not Accurate - No Attibution,"This book places Woodwards credibility in the dumper with Richard Clarke's. The quotes are not attributed and therefore lure the typical intellectual lightweight into believing all that is written here. Unfortuanetly, this is just another partisan attempt to nitpick the fine details involved in the decision to remove Saddam from power after UN sanctions did not work. This book lacks important context such as:Years of violated sanctionsWe were attacked on 911Bush went to congress - passedBush went to the U.N. - passedSaddam has WMD - Ask a Kurd about theseSaddam was developing a nukeUnfortunately, Woodward focuses on simple details out of context, reducing him to another partisan policy weenie. Those of you on the left will, as usual, ignore these facts and not think for yourselves anyway and use this book to reinforce your points."
2,Anyone Can Apparently Write A Book These Days!,"All the BELTWAY 'BS"" is beginning to get to me. Please, give me a 'GD"" break! Make up your mind fellas, you cannot have it both ways! Now which is it? Credibility? Fair & Balanced Reporting Of The ""REAL"" facts? Hard decision to go to war, oh, please, spare me! Liberal propaganda? You people are giving me a ""GD"" headache! What all you dofis' won't do for your fifteen minutes of fame! Get over yourselves and write something worth reading!"
1,"lies, lies, lies","This is more of the lefts lies. You might as well face it, the left will come up with anything to slam the president. Anyone have any flipflops?"
3,questionable,"When contradictory statements are made about the veracity of the contents of a book like this, the tendency is to give the author credence. Well, Woodward may be telling the truth regarding Powell's being out of the loop. But, anyone who automatically gives Woodward the benefit of the doubt, please, please, please read the book SILENT COUP: THE REMOVAL OF A PRESIDENT. It has much documented evidence that Woodward has told and written some monumental lies in the past. And maybe he's changed since then, but I, for one, am not going to count on that."
4,"Compelling Reading, but Slightly Disjointed","Mr. Hoffman writes with a clear and lucid style and raises some interesting points about the Unabomber Case, the Columbine Shootings and the role of the mass media in society. However, it seems like you could read the chapters in any order you wished and still end up in the same place. Along similar lines, I guess my only complaint is that the book gives you enough information on a subject so that you become really interested (Occult Elements of the Son Of Sam shootings, for instance) and then simply moves on to something else. I think if the book were 100 pages longer, I would have given it 5 stars. Having said that, I should note that Mr. Hoffman has a rare gift for utilizing the English language and I enjoyed this book."
5,Nothing flowery or superlfuous here,"Mr. Hoffman doesn't waste a word in his writings, and this can seem blunt to those unwilling to learn from someone of his caliber. This book is chock full of insights that are seriously lacking in other treatments of this material. Anyone who has delved into this subject at length has seen just how often this book has been quoted! He easily could have multiplied the length of this book several times, but his ability to distill things down to their essentials is what sets Hoffman apart from his wordier contemporaries.Highly recommended."
5,ahead of its time...yet timely!,"Studying conspiracy for years, it doesn't suffice to say that Hoffman has done his homework. He pulls back the covers of the greatest conspiracy of all time and reveals his insights succinctly.Please do not pick this book up for light reading or if you are new to subjects such as conspiracy theory, the occult, or secret societies. It will not make much sense to you.Having said that, if you are halfway attuned to the world around you and can find truth despite having to tolerate mainstream garbage, this book will open your eyes even more.After reading dozens of related books I keep coming back to this one. Brilliant!"
5,Not a Primer,"This is a great book for those already knowledgeable about freemasonry, the occult, and the New World Order conspiracy but it is not a book for those new to new to the subject. If you know who Albert Pike is and are well versed in the subject, buy this book! You will not be disappointed."
5,Simply mind-blowing and thought-provoking,"Mike Hoffman has inspired me into investigating occult crimes as well as performing investigative reporting on Secret Societies, their tools & tactics; simply becuase I didn't find his book to be a pile of conspiracy theory junk. His referances which he's used provide his writings and findings the weight they require in order for the readers to digest such info and think about it. I would strongly recommend this book for those moral people in the world of media and/or advertising to analyze whether their services are benefitting the new world order, if so, then how to change it."
3,This One Is For The Kids,This is a great coloring book for kids under 10 who don't care if the pictures lack detail.
5,Basic And Brutal just like you are looking for when rocking this band out,Great vocals live seen them a few times my fav band in the world great dvd to add to the ever growing collectiondeath metal
2,This game could be a master piece but..........,"We (pinball fans) were anxiosly waiting for this title before it was relesed... I have mine today and I want to share my experiences with every tentative customer.It's a shame that a game that could be a master piece of pinball somulation ends in a mediocre bundle of tables that has nothing to do with the real tables.1. Ball Physics is horrible, unreal and boring... just shoot any ramps and the ball just end up at the top, also at times it moves extremely and unrealistically fast.2. Sounds are not like the real tables, and are not high Quality.3. The genie in TOTAN, is like a cardboard when you hit itIn summary, if you want to buy a real pinball simulation, stay with the Pro Pinball series, these are by far better...This is another mediocre encore software.what a shame!"
2,"I found the ""fragrance"" ingrredientsto be more like a chemical smell",Unlike Bronner - smells like chemicals - not clean. Wake up and read the labels.
1,A little too big.,These work great if you pull out immediately after ejaculation. They are on the big side and have come off twice after ejaculation.
2,Fair-weather Tent.......,"It's a fabulous sunny-weather tent, realtively cozy for two persons of average size and weight....but when it rains it POURS. It LEAKS through every cross-hatched weave of thread it's made of. You'll scream like I screamed, curse like the sailor you will be whilst drifting about, angrily wondering why you decided to let your desire to save a little dough has literally drowned you in sorrow.....and it wasn't even a heavy rain. Alas."
4,Nice tent for the money,"Easy to set up.. well made.. only complaint is that it is pretty tight in there.. 6 foot length is not a full 6 foot length for actually stretching out. IF you are under 6 feet, this tent would be great."
4,Exactly what I was looking for.,This was a great tent for $10. It's perfect for my kids to set up in the back yard to play in. They even set it up in their bedrooms sometimes. It is fairly easy to roll up and get back in the case.
2,Not very reliable,"This tent was given to me as gift from my wife. I've taken it on two trips, one a three night backpacking trip and the other an overnight car camping trip in cold weather. On the first trip the condensation was terrible! Every morning I woke up to find my sleeping bag wet. Luckily I have a very good sleeping bag! On the second trip one of the support poles shattered while I was trying to set up the tent! Save your money and spend a bit more to get a better tent!"
4,"Better than expected, a new standard for the series.",This book was actually better than I expected. The overall atmosphere was suitably creepy and the story was just better written than some of the other GYG books. The story is about a haunted camp where everyone is acting strange. You will either end up investigating alien activity or facing down carnivorous zombies on a mountain. Recommended.
1,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS VERY BORING AND NOT VERY INTERESTING,I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK AT ALL.IF YOUR SMART YOU WON'T BUY THIS BOOK. MARK NICOLOSI AGE 12
1,An Alright Book,This is an alright book because it's easy to read. This book was for SSR in my english class. Its about a girl that goes to camp and when she goes hiking stuff start to happen to her. It was boring because I knew what was going to happen.
5,Don't Listen to the Others,"Don't listen to the others. They're just cranky. Combine inspiring music and awesome pictures of the plaets and what do you get? A great movie that surpasses the ratings of two fellow watchers. Hey, there were bad reviews for EVERY great movie, but sometimes, you just have to look for the good ones."
2,Great DVD... if it was made by a 8th grader!,"The only thing that saved this DVD from a single star rating was the fact that you can turn off your video and listen to the music. This is by far the worst proffesional production I've ever seen.Here is the idea... take some pretty cool voyager pictures of planets... cut them out and place them on a make believe star field. THEN super-impose cheep 3D renderings of the voyager spacecraft. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!That's not to say you won't be entertained... you'll get a good laugh. The most spectacular thing about this DVD is the number of people in the credits. One guy in his basement would have made sense...Seriously though, it would have made an excelent 8th grade video project.Please please please... save your money and buy a DVD that took more than a week to make."
1,Terrible,"This was released on LD.It is a very poor compilation.It has no structure, the music does not fit at all, and the sloppy editing does nothing to enhance this film. There are very much better space compilations on this subject on the market."
4,How do they *not* do it?,"As a musician, I am most impressed by Karate's restraint on this album. That said, there are some all out smoldering tracks on this record; Diazapam, for instance has more raw angsty energy than 99% of punk rock. But listen to Bass Sounds: a haunting track that performs the only real magic of music - transmuting mundane experiences into revelatory statements. Now, I have tried to play every instrument on this track and I can't do it, but not because the music is to complicated, but because it is to simple. Long, langorous melodic phrases and metronomic intensity don't have the proper effect if you fill in the space with noodles or variations or whatever. It just doesn't sound right. But for the life of me I can't play this song without adding to it. So, props to Karate's phenomenal feats of restraint. My conclusion is that the members of Karate are monks, and this album is their treatise. Also, There Are Ghosts is one of the best songs ever written."
3,"If half-star increments were available, I'd give it a 3.5...","Karate is a decent band, and they'll certainly grow on you, but they're just not amazing or anything. Pretty good, pretty much sums it up..."
3,O.K.,"I was introduced to Karate by a friend, and got huge recommendations as well. I was looking for something original, mostly in Indie/Lo-Fi genres, infact as i heard/read different reviews of Karate and especially this album it seemed like they've done to Indie world the same as ""Tool"" did to metal music. Anyway, probably because of high expectations i didn't like the album, there are some excellent bits here and there, but mostly music-wise its just-another indie act + not smart lyrics.If you want to pick yet-another indie album which will satisfy your hunger for music for couple of months, its highly recommended but it got no staying power. I'll recommed ""Dredg"" and ""Iron & Wine"" to anybody who is looking for exceptional stuff."
5,Four Generations of Family Values,"Warm, pocket and purse size book of family values through four generations. The reader sees that mothers do make a difference in time spent with children. Any time is quality time and setting a good example is part of being a mother. Whether it is showing compassion for others or putting affectionate notes in a child's lunch bag, love is endless and ever-expanding. Though the world may change, prayer is a constant. ""Through the Generations"" is readable and reinforced with Scripture quotes and anecdotes. Inspirational and family-oriented."
4,Who hasn't been there???,"I usually dont buy or read poetry, but after searching for stories about tragic romances, I came across this book and thought I would give it a shot. It is so relatable. We have all been in the position of falling in love so hard that it consumes you and many of us have been treated badly. This book takes you through the trials of it all in a cool way. It makes me want to read more poetry like it. Maybe it has changed my views on poetry. Before this, the last time I read any was in high school!! Buy it!"
4,Great artwork,"This book has really nice artwork for every chapter. I liked the writing a lot, but the artwork made the book whole. A+"
5,One of the best short story collections I have read all year,"Vestal McIntyre has created the most eccentric characters and bizarre situations in this collection of darkly funny short stories. He writes about things that people could relate to, yet he adds a touch of peculiar situations that make the stories dark and compelling at the same time. Some stories were written in second-person narrative and that gave the stories a more unique voice. My favorite story is ""ONJ.com."" I like to think of the aforementioned story as Will and Grace with a twist. I also loved ""Nightwalking,"" ""Disability,"" and ""Binge."" I enjoyed entering McIntyre's world with this fascinating collection and I look forward to reading more of his stuff in the future."
5,"fingers, thumbs, monkeys, drums, woohoo!","This one was an immediate hit with my 13 month old, and now, two months later, he insists I read it to him over and over again. The ""Dum ditty dum ditty dum dum dum"" refrain is intoxicating, even for an adult reader, and the classic artwork humorous and fun. This book is definitely one worth buying--it will capture your young one's attention immediately with its rhythm.The highest recommendation."
5,Utterly infectious and fun,"I had forgotten this book from my childhood, but when I found it again, I remembered how wonderful it is. My 7-month-old daughter laughs and laughs when I read it to her! The rhythms of the words are absolutely delightful -- I recommend this to any parent!! Dum ditty dum ditty dum dum dum..."
3,Michelle Gordon,This book was okay for a young child. I would reccommend this book for a child within the age-range of Pre-K to first grade. I was a really tongue tying book. I will teach kids to have good diction and to say words fast without getting all tied up in their words.
5,love this book,I loved reading this book to my children. Now I get to read it to my grandchild. He's only 2 months old but likes the rhythm of the words. It's easy to jazz up the words.
5,Children and now Grandchildren love this book,"Great 'beat', we have worn out several copies over the years. All the kids love it."
3,abbreviated fun,This is a fun book to read and watch. The rhythm is easy for adults to say and children to hear. My daughter was hooked after the first read. It is not the original but an abridged version of the Dr. Suess classic. 5 stars if it was in full form.
3,Feeling a little jipped!,"I was raised on this book as a child, and have only the fondest of memories. My book that I had as a child was a first edition hardback that today is quite worn, but still in great use. My 14 month old boy has adopted this book as his favorite as well. Yet, 14 month olds don't fully understand the concept of not ripping pages. So recently I purchased the board book version of Hand Hand Fingers Thumb. I was extremely disapointed that six pages from the original book were omitted! The part omitted is the 'Hello Jack, Hello Jake... and Bye Bye Jake, Bye Bye Jack, and also the Hands with hankerchiefs blow blow blow part. While the book is still a great reading and listening tool, I was very disapointed that this great little board book, that will stand my sons pounding, is abridged."
4,Pages removed from earlier printing,My two-year-old son loves this book. He discovered my old copy and I ordered this new one for him. I was sad to discover that several pages from the middle of the book have been removed in the newer printing. The part missing is his favorite part of the book. I wish they had not been removed and cannot understand why they would be....
3,Baby Version,"I had no idea this was a small, condensed ""Baby"" version of the original. I think it should have been explained in the description. Even the thumbnail shows the full-size version of this book with angled corners, not the rounded corners of a baby's board book. Granted, I see the keyword, (""Board"" Books) in parenthesis now, but I did not catch that subtle hint the first time. So if you're looking for the full-size version like I was, you will be disappointed if you purchase this one. This is not it. It also does not contain the complete original text. :\As far as the story goes, it is my favorite Dr Seuss title. But at this size, it's not easy for a Mom to hold and read from or even a Kindergartner (too clumsy and small). So, I'll be looking for the original full-sized version as soon as I post this review."
5,Son Loves It,"I first got this from the library and we took it on a plane trip to UT. My son fell in love.A couple months later we checked it out again, and he remembered it! He started shaking his little bum to the beat, and would crawl to it and bring it to me all the time. When his aunt asked what he'd want for his birthday, I told her to get him this. She sent it from amazon and it came newer than I could have imagined.The story is a cute little tale about drumming monkeys. The beat (and some words) are dum dittty dum ditty dum dum dum. Hope your child loves bouncing to that as much as mine does."
4,Hand Hand Fingers Thumb,"I have had the book ""Hand Hand Fingers Thumb"" since I was about two. I must have read it 500 times. It was a regular bedtime story for me. It is a very easy book to read. The words aren't very big and they are repeated so that the young kids can learn the words easier. The book has very good flow and great pictures. All of the pictures have monkeys in them and you know every kid loves monkeys. The rhymes are very good such as; ""Hello Jack. Hello Jake. Shake Hands Shake Hands Shake! Shake! Shake!"" There isn't much of a plot to this story but I think it is a very good story anyways."
2,Disappointed,"This book was a favorite with my children many years ago, so now as a grandmother, I was excited about the prospect of introducing it to my grandaughter. Like so many others, I was surprised and disappointed to see so many pages missing. Wondering if any of the used books available could possibly include the original? Now I'm on a search for the original!"
1,Not the original version,"My son absolutely LOVES Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb. It was a book that my mom and I adored as children as well. I wanted to buy it for him and saw that this item was priced pretty low. However, it is an abridged version and my son was rather irritated the first time that I read it to him. He thought that I was ""skipping pages"" since he practically has this book memorized. I would have given this book five stars if it was the full version. It should be listed somewhere in the description that the bright and early books are not the full versions..."
5,"Hand, Hand Book","My kids have loved this book since they were little ones themselves. Now that they have small children, we got one for them to share"
5,Timeless classic!,"I am 30 years old, my father read me and my siblings this book as we were growing up...I bought a 'board book' copy for my son but was disappointed that some pages were missing - this version of the book has all the pages as the one I grew up with. My 28-month old LOVES to read this story and can say the words along with us now...a great book for your own children or to give as a gift!"
5,Rhythmic,"This is a must have for the little boy in your life. Sure my daughter likes it too, but it's hard to find good boy books. This is a GREAT boy book. My nephew is almost two and can't be without his. While reading the pages, we drum the words out on the pages or stomp our feet to the rhythm. My 6 month old son will sit through 4 or 5 readings before he's not interested. The board book version is very durable. It stands up against my son who likes to suck on the binding. (I try and stop him, but it's futile.)"
4,like a great jazz song for kids!,"This book is about a bunch of beatnik jazz musicians from the 60's with crazy sideburns.Oh, wait.This book is about some mellow monkeys with very cool hair who do hypnotizing things with basic english and rhymes.There is something about Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb that really gets to a kid: the combination of simple rhyming text and bright pop art images on plain white backgrounds works its magic spell on whoever reads it. And when I dug it out again after over 30 (!) years, i found myself entranced. It holds up.Reading this aloud will lend even the most tone-deaf among us a sudden musical power -- you'll find yourself singing, not reading it, to your bemused young audience. It reminds me of a great record: never loses its flavor, even after the thousandth play.Dum ditty dum ditty dum dum dum!"
5,These guys are wrong,"I dont know how the other 3 reviewers treat thier computer accessories, but I have never had an issue with my drive. I have used my external every day for 2 years now and it has never once given me any trouble. It gets carried back and forth from college to home, it gets plugged into multiple computers, and its been hit by surges before, and it still has not died. If this one did die for whatever reason, I'd buy another one."
1,Dead from the start,"I agree with the other reviewers, this drive does not work at all. I returned my drive the day after I bought it -- it simply didn't work.I bought it to back up some MP3s and photos, but although my computer ""recognized"" it immediately, I could not write to the drive at all. The operating system showed that the files were writing to the drive, but they were actually writing to a temp file on my C: drive.After several attempts, I just gave up and returned it. Considering the other problems people are having with reliability, I just could not consider giving it another chance. This isn't a great product and I recommend that you wait for better USB drives before getting into this category.I just plan to wait for something better, although the IDEA of a USB drive, where data will be easily transferrable to another computer and ease the current congestion on my current drive is a great one. This product just didn't work at all."
1,Perfect for catastrophic data loss,"This drive worked beutifully in the first 10 months in on of our school research laboratories, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC. After they trusted it for work and research data backup, done just once every 2 weeks, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, they simply got nothing. Surperisingly, when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University, they discovered that many of us, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there before."
3,No patterns found in this book.,"This Kwik-Sew book is not like new books. This one is very detailed to demonstrate how to make the clothing look professional. However, the newer Kwik-Sew books have patterns included. With this book, I will still need to purchase or draft the pattern and then sew. Most Kwik-Sew patterns are wonderfully detailed as is to discuss short cuts and created professional looking clothing. I am slightly disappointed in this book and am glad that I purchased an used copy since I still need to make/buy the patterns."
5,second generation,"I bought this book for my daughter many years ago when she learned to read, and we both laughed at each page. In fact, I may have laughed harder than she, because I could look back at being a child and remember how important being ""the best"" was--no matter how insignficant the subject was. This purchase is for my granddaughter, who has the same sense of humor. I can't wait to put my head next to hers, to giggle together, to see this story from the point of view of a child, and to realise how silly it is to become so frustrated at something so small!Misanthropes, go read another book and leave us folks with a sense of humor alone to enjoy this one!!!"
1,Is THIS What You Want to Teach Your Young Child?,"At the end of the excellent 400-page text/program ""Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons,"" twenty books are recommended for children who now (according to the text) read at a second-grade level. This is the 18th book on the list of twenty. In this book, ""Mine's the Best,"" two boys argue over whose beach toy is the best, and eventually attempt to emotionally and physically harm each other. Page 21: ""Yours is sick."" 22: ""Yours is too."" 24: ""Yours is dead."" 25: ""Yours is dead too."" 26: ""It's all your fault."" 27: ""No, it's all YOUR fault."" 28: ""Let go of my pants."" 29: ""Let go of my hat."" 30: (A girl walks by with a nicer beach toy.) 31: (Both Boys together) ""I hate her."" If you are looking for books to help your child learn to read, there are better ones out there that do not come with this unnecessary nonsense."
1,This book is mean spirited and bad for kids,"I agree with the review that talks about how bad this book is for kids. The boys fight over which balloon is best, they say they ""hate"" a girl who gets in the middle, they kill their balloons until they are ""dead."" It's really inappropriate for the young audience it's aimed at. My husband read the book to my daughters first and couldn't believe I had bought it. I took a look and threw it away. That's what you do with (garbage). Trust me, don't buy this."
5,"The book's not sick, just the reader's mind","Both of my children read this book when they were younger. They are now grown with children of their own. The reviewer who wrote the review must have a perverted and narrow mind. After I read the book after several years time, I cannot see what the reviewer say was bad. It's natural for children to say that their property is the best and for boy's to tease girls. That's life, get on with it and stop looking for hidden agendas."
2,If Barbie lives in the projects this is the house for you!,"If you are looking for a doll house that says ""Daddy loves ya and since you've been such a good girl, here is a gift"" then this probably isnt the house for you. I admit I paniced when I could not find the Barbie doll house she had mentioned and it was getting close to Christmas so I bought this one.It is flimsy. The manufacturer put the part label stickers directy on the design overlay. If you are not careful you will tear up the design. The only parts that are wooden are the outline frame, everything else is thick cardboard with a printed sheet to depict different rooms, etc. glued over it.It will work for now, but Im not pleased with it all around. It will however make a great template to build one myself with all wood construction."
1,Fell apart upon assembly,"The house was not difficult to assemble, however it came unglued. There are only screws and dowels to use to assemble the product but the pre-glued areas came undone and the whole thing fell apart. It is a nice house, I would just be prepared to re-glue everything and wait for it to dry, then assemble."
5,I lost 30 pounds with this excellent workout!!!,"I was using tapes that moved too slowly, and that I only followed a couple of times before bordom set in. Liz is amazing at progressively building on the routine which keeps you coming back for more. The more times I did it the more I got out of it!Thanks Liz :)"
1,I'd rather be big than doing this chaotic routine,"(disclaimer: I am NOT big, I am actually quite trim but I'd like to keep it that way and therefore I use home workout tapes in between gym sessions.)After you get through a solid 12 minutes of spam, clips, and advertising, you are finally presented with a sloppily thrown together, uncoordinated poor excuse for Pilates. Beginners (which I am not) would be lost altogether as the instructor doesn't demonstrate her steps. The mat work is marginally better but not enough for me to ever touch it again. Therefore, this tape and the other ones I also bought from this series in the same purchase, are going in the ""Goodwill"" bag."
3,Needs some work,"Since the book is used as the training material for Altova classes, I wouldn't expect to see all the errors such as wrong file names and menu selection. The book assumes that you are fully experienced with XMLSpy, so has little explaination as to how to do the samples. The type face for the code samples is done with a dot-matrix font making it hard to read and the screen capture images look like 6th generation washed out copies. Over half the book is about XPath 1 & 2. The sample files that you down load come with a copy of the book in PDF & chm format. Both of these are in color and very readable.Like alot of class based training guide, this is a tecyhnical description of the pieces of XSLT without the why or where you would use it.If you get this book, put the book on the shelf and use the PDF or chm files to read it."
4,Stripes Dinnerware Set,"I like the looks and colors on the bands because it will match any color I put in my kitchen. Nice big mugs. I haven't used them yet, but the workmanship and quality looks good. A good buy for the price."
4,Great dinnerware...,"I really like the dinnerware, it's solid and tough feeling, but very cute. The only drawback is that I haven't been able to find any additional pieces, i.e. cream and sugar, butter tray, serving pieces, etc.For an everyday dinnerware, it's wonderful!"
3,"Inspiring Story, Decent Book","This book, while highly introspective in some areas of Winters' life, was only decent, at least for me, because, having read ""Band of Brothers"" and having seen the miniseries, the first half of the book was basically a recap of that story, with a few details added.What really struck me as interesting was the second half of the book (approx.), which detaild Winters' life after the war was over. This is the Winters we have never seen, who stuggles to find a suitable job and who dreads going back to war (in Korea). In my opinion, the author should have focused more on this area and less on the war, as chances are the eaders of this book have already read ""Band of Brothers"" or seen the miniseries.However, if you have not seen the miniseries or read the book, this is an excellent tribute to a fine man. If you have, it turns into a pretty quick read, as you can basically skim over the war that you already know and focus and the new and intriguing parts."
4,Worth reading,"I have read a handful of the reviews listed and I agree with a few of them, some ""minor"" details have been wrong, but overall, I found this book an excellent insight into who Major Winters is. Yes, this book dealt more about the major and confrontations he and the company faced, but I believe it was written to show more of what Major Winters thought and had to deal with. B.O.B. dealt more with the company as a whole.If one is interested in knowing ""who"" the major is, this book is an excellent choice. A very quick read and if you're like me, you won't want to put it down once it's opened."
4,Just Curious...,"I'm enjoying this account of the Winters/Easy Co. story, but am curious about two things: 1) How the pagination editor missed the use of 8 where 6 is needed throughout the text. It's not the end of the world, just a bit disconcerting. 2) This book was published in 2005 as ""Biggest Brother - The Life of Major Dick Winters, by Larry Alexander, but Beyond the Band of Brothers, The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters was published in 2006 by Dick Winters and Col. Cole Kingseed, and covers the same ground.BTW: We own the BoB mini series, and I've read the book. I also bought and will read both books mentioned here."
3,Can't wait for the real memoirs,"Had just about finished the book when a son of one of the soldiers in the regiment pointed out to me that this was not ""the"" memoirs of Major Winters. His will come out early next year. While there is slightly more information on the pre and post war Winters, there will probably be more in the up-coming authorized book.Since I am an unabashed Dick Winters fan, I read this book with interest and will also get the new one as soon as I can"
3,Book Review,Can't emphasize too much how much this is a rehash of the Band of Brother's book. The last bit on leadership was the best part of the book. The entire Band of Brother's story is a great lesson in leadership. Dick Winter's provides his own particular input on this topic. Would only wish he had elaborated.Would recommend only if you are interested in the subject of leadership--that's this book's added value.
2,Nothing More than Regurgitation and Plagarism,"I have 3 major complaints about this book: 1. The author has abused his accidental access to Major Winters and often brags about his friendship and access to the Major and thus, particularly in the opening, attempts to make the book about him (the author) rather than about Major Winters. 2. This book is mainly regurgitation of material already in print. There is no or very little original research. Not only is it regurgitation, there are many lines that were blatantly plagarized from other sources, verbatim or nearly verbatim, and the author did not properly quote those other sources. 3. It is completely unforgivable for the author to completely skip over D-Day. It makes the work unacceptable and not credible."
2,Only for Absolute Band of Brothers Fans,Overall I am disappointed by the biography of this great man. It doesn't really do him justice. If you have read Stephen Ambrose's book on the experiences of Easy Company of the 506th then this book adds very little more. Therefore only buy it if you want to complete your collection but it is in no way as rich as Websters or Donald Burgetts offerings.There are disappointingly few additional anecdotes to compel the reader. The only ones being that the rumours about Cpt. Spiers were all true and on the night of D-day Guarenere didn't prematurely start the ambush on the German patrol as the TV mini-series shows but did minutes later shoot 3 German PoW's they had just taken.You do get some brief insight into the man by the quotes to his letters home. Unfortunately it tells you little about him which you didn't already know. Personally I wish I hadn't bothered to buy it given what is in my collection already.
3,"Same thing as BoB, only with more detail","I thought this was going to be a biography of Dick Winters, but it's not. I'm a huge fan of the Band of Brothers series, and was hoping to gain some insight into what made Winters such a great leader. The book really doesn't get into that. Instead, we're given BoB all over again, only the camera focuses solely on him. In short, if you're a BoB fan looking for some more detail, read this. But don't expect to learn what drove Winters or any neat details about his upbrining."
5,Biggest Brother,"Well, after years of reading other books by members of 506 PIR, the man himself tells his story. We all have been wondering about the man behind the ""Band of Brothers"" and now we can learn his story. This book was great, well written and a joy to finally read. Major Dick Winters is truly a leader among men. Someone who deserves our respect and remebrance for all the other young men who fought and fell in this period for our country. Thanks to Dick Winters for sharing a part of his life with us and to Larry Alexander for bringing it to us."
5,I love Farscape,"Why is it on a very rare occasion we are able to catch a series that doesn't completely suck, and just when you get used to television that isn't mind-numbingly dumb they take it away from you? Ahh, another disappointment. Farscape Rocks and this DVD rocks along with all their other DVD's. It's a shame the SciFi channel has sold out and replaced Farscape with crap like Scare Tactics. It's tragic. I love Farscape!"
1,waste of money,I can't recommend buying any of the farscape DVDS since the SciFi channel decided to end the series without producing a final episode.
5,it really works,"I have been working through this book with a counselor who deals primarily with chronic pain patients. It is already starting to change my life, even though I am only on the third technique. After > 2 years trying to learn to live with chronic pain, I am finding techniques that are making a difference!"
4,APA book: Pain Survival Guide helpful,A helpful book. Easy read. No background in psychology/medical knowledge necessary to understand content. Book contains some grammatical errors- but editing could be better for 90 percent of literature on the market. Visualization and breathing exercises discussed are useful/pragmatic and may be easily adapted to manage a wide variety of chronic pain conditions. Used techniques presented in book to mitigate symptomatology associated with fibromyalgia.
5,this bookhelper,"THIS BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN. IT IS HELPING ME UNDERSTAND MY PAIN AND WHERE I CAN GET HELP. I AM 71 YRS OLD AND IF IT HELPS ME, IT WILL HELP OTHERS."
2,Nothing new.,"I have tennis elbow for 5 years, i have some read books on my belt, i think this book discusses everything a little bit, bringing nothing that we don't know. It tells you that you have to manage well all the pain issues. But hey, i am not screwing up things. I Recomend Egoscue books"""
1,Big low class book!,"Come on! This book is a low class load of it! The University of Mississippi is the best college ever! What low life guy would sit there and write about good colleges? This author probably didn't even go to college or he probably wasn't even accepted anywhere! This book series is just low! For all of you Ole Miss fans out there, tell this guy he is just a tacky low life!I can't even put all of my anger in this review! This Paul Finebaum guy needs to get a life, if he wants to be an author, he shouldn't be a scummy low life and talk about the best college ever (Ole Miss). Ole Miss is such a great college, did you know the Ole Miss softball team is the 4th in the nation?So when this Finebaum guy types on his keyboard, he should make real use of the keyboard!"
1,written by an Ole Miss dropout,This guy couldn't hack it at Ole Miss so he had to transfer to Alabummer. What more do you expect?
1,This is Finebaum's best book by far. If you are mentally,"retarded that is. What a loser.Check out Chris Warner's ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" for a real book on the nation's toughest football playing conference. Don't waste your time with Finebum's journalism."
1,disappointed,"In ordering this book, ""Diary of God's Generals"" I thought it would be more detailed and thicker in pages. It's a very small booklet, NOT book, fits in my hand and definately was NOT worth the price I paid. This booklet was only worth a couple of dollars at best.I think the wording should have been ""booklet"" NOT book. Short, small & a quick read. Seller should include how many pages too.I had ordered another paperback book, ""Greater Works"" and WOW.......that was worth every penny. I paid less for that book, it has 586 pages compared to 87 pages that God's Generals has.Please let your seller know, we want details and all of them. I really didn't care about doggie ears of the pages or highlighting in the book."
2,not for young children,"This book is not for kids. The lingo is too complex. Unless you are a snowboarder, you have no clue what the book talks about. There is a glossary in the back but who is going to read that to 5 year-olds?"
4,"great intro snowboarding jargon, some poor choices","This would be a perfect book, had it not shown snowboarders jumping off a chair lift. I have been a snowboarder for over 20 years and have never seen anyone jump off a chair lift, not to mention what a poor example that gives to young potential snowboarders."
1,Not for my kids....,"Rhino's who Snowboard is not a book for younger kids. What 4 year old is snowboarding or needs to know what ""Phat Air"" is. And what parent would want to buy a book for those so young that teach it's ok to call someone a ""MOGUL hopping KOOKS"" which according to the glossary in back means,"" bump jumping jerks"" And the older kids who do snowboard should be reading books with a little more depth to them. This book has great illustrations but has a lot lacking in the story line."
5,"Impecable, very well done...","I love the 1st , 4th & 8th track... no come to think of it. I love the whole CD."
5,"All Of These CDs Are Really Great...,","Saw Mehdi Live on PBS A while back and now have all of his CDs. I absolutely love every one of these remarkable CDs and highly recommend them to all who like this genre of music. Although I love Instrumental Fantasy volume 4 especially song 4 ""Mediterranean Dream"" , I really can't say that it's ""his best"". My sister loves his new release volume 7 instrumental Heaven and I still really have a hard time deciding which one i like the best. This artist has a way of creating beautiful music that is pleasantly different from CD to the next and believe me they are all really good. I use them in my multi disc and don't even notice the time flying by at work. Very highly recommended !"
1,Glorified Elevator Music,"I first came across Mehdi in a group called Ekova which produced some intriguing exotic sounds and was curious about the artists in the group. So, I looked up Mehdi in Amazon and was pleased to see so many positive reviews. I was lucky enough to see this CD at my local library and decided to check it out before purchasing - am I glad I did. I'm not sure what all the hype is because this CD is really no more than elevator-poppish-mood music (Ugh - clap-track??!! C'mon).Check out Pacific Moon's performers such as Jia Peng Fang, Jalan Jalan or Mizuyo Komiya and you'll find top-rate quality compositions that will soothe or uplift your spirit.Sorry Mehdi but this CD is glorified elevator music at best, which is dissappointing because I did enjoy Ekova. I'm glad I didn't waste my money."
5,The Story Of A Soul.,"This is a very profound Catholic book written by Saint Therese who is in Heaven as are both her parents.It is a description of her short life,she died aged 24,and also her families life.The writing is very descriptive and easy to follow but it is the message which must be understood.Saint Therese offered to God all her daily thoughts and actions with love,she calls it The Little Way,nothing dramatic just the little things we can all do with love,What sets her apart is her immense thrust in the Mercy of God. She foretold she would spend her Heaven doing good upon earth which is in fact constantly happening.I very much wish the whole of humanity could read this book and be influenced by it,it would be a far greater world."
5,A Must Read,"A must read book of simple, pure, humble love. We all can learn from this beautiful book. A book to read over and over again and learn something new each time."
5,Awesome Story,"This is a beautiful autobiography of a beautiful soul which is very humbling to the person reading it. She presents situations that ordinary people would react in a very different way that makes you realize that she, from a very young age was destined to be a Saint and a Doctor of the Church. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,Story of a Soul,only problem is that picture shown online for cover is not the cover on the actual book. But the book came in great condition.
4,Pretty good workout,"i was definatly sore the next day after doing this ( then again im really out of shape). it is fun and dolphina ( the instructor) is very motivating being skinny & pretty. I would have given it 4 stars except that for some of the parts where your doing foot moves, the camera is zoomed in on her face and you dont know what your supposed to be doing. She gives verbal cues and then it shows the steps half way thoruhg. So perhaps if you watch it / do it several times you would be able to master the moves and know what to do , even though they dont show it right away."
3,New Years Eve just isn't the same.,"When it came to big bands, Glenn Miller's was my favorite. Liked Lombardo & this pictorial look at his life (penned not long after his passing) isn't bad of its type. Lombardo aficionados, however, will really enjoy it."
3,This book could have been better,"A close friend of mine whose story is in this book gave it too me as a present. Unfortunately, it took me nearly 20 minutes to find his story as there is no Table of Contents or Index! Also, the authors didn't even include his soon-to-be wife's name! I noticed that none of the other stories had the spouse's name either. If I was in this book, I'd be dissapointed. Other than that, it's a nice collection of stories and has soom good, practical ideas for proposals and not wakcy stories, like renting a hot-air balloon or something like some of the other proposal books I've read."
5,Excellent!,"This border is as easy to put up as it is cute! Did my 2 yr old gransons room. Just moved the furniture to the middle of the room measured up from the floor and put the border a little higher than half way up. Only took a short time & only need one person. Looks great, and since its peels right off will be no problen to take down later to change."
5,Great Case,"The Sony carrying case is great for carrying small electronics like video cameras. It is spacious with enough room to carry equipment, wires and batteries (if the equipment isn't huge). We can fit our video camera, digital camera, wires for both and cell phones, extra cards and tapes and tons of batteries! Great for traveling!"
3,It's awfully big...,"It's a huge bag, its not really made for tiny camcorders, you can fit all the accesories and still have space. It's not made for comfort, it's made for putting everything in there.I wouldn't go around carrying it, it looks awfully big and you might look like a dork, try to find something tinier for your camera."
1,Danger 1 inch wire spacing,"Wire spacing is almost 1 inch and is dangerous, a small or medium bird can easily trap its head !I returned this to Amazon ASAP !"
2,"Donald Glaude ""This is me""","Not the sender's fault for the low rating. The item came very quickly and in good condition, however Im not impressed with the music from Donald Glaude. Not worth the money."
1,Monardo's Novel Filled with Cliches,"Although it is hardly worth taking the time to mention, I feel I must take a few minutes to relate my complete and utter disappointment with this novel. Not only is the entire concept of the book cliche, overused, et cetera, but the character development is weak and the plot is predictable. I could have laid out the entire story by reading the back cover. If you like sappy, cliche, overdone themes, characters, settings, plots, and on and on, this book is for you."
4,"Finally, an objective look at the subject","Very interesting reading, he manages to report the prophesies without hyping or doomsdaying them. He also settles alot of misunderstandings of scripture that plague people. Above all, you walk away understanding that tomorrow will come and if you live your life in a thoughtful manner, you will do just fine. I'm glad I bought it."
3,Average Book - Mostly a check list,it was okay but too much of a check list and not enough commentary on where we are in fulfilling these prophesies.
5,We Can ALL Do It!,"With life getting more and more hectic all the time, this is one of the only half hour segments of your day where everything works out the way it should-and so do you. This video has a streching warm up & cool down, a very light touch of aerobics, and toning for every single area in an easy, fun and energizing way. All her assistants are cheerful & attractive (I don't mind that 80's look)and make you feel like you're working out with your best friends.The best part is you see a difference in only two weeks! This is my first Denise video, and after trying other peoples workouts, hers are the only ones I'm going use."
3,Good targeting but minimal difficulty,"This tape is about as low-key as they come. I just completed it for the first time and didn't even break a sweat and I'm not a workout guru. This is VERY low impact target toning. The arm exercises were surprisingly good despite the lack of weights. The hip toning exercises were a killer for someone who hasn't worked them much...but I can tell they'll get results. The rest was plain old easy to do. Overall, it's a nice tape to work into other tapes, but definitely won't do it by itself. I prefer her Totally Firm tape to this one. But would come back to this one for the hip toning exercises."
4,Overall Toning Workout,"Definitely an 80's tape as far as hairdo's & clothing. However, the toning exercises are good. I started with this before moving up to weights. I still go back to it when I feel tired. Denise uses some suprisingly simple moves that work!"
2,"Rehash, but......","The collection stops in 1987 because this is a Mercury/Polygram product. Rush went to Atlantic after A Show of Hands. If you don't own any Rush, this, The Retrospectives I and II, Spirit of Radio or Chronicles are good best of, sort of collections. Rush have bashed Chronicles, but for a while it was the only CD version available of Passage To Bangkok, but I digress. They were involved in the art for SoR, and song selection and art for the Retrospectives. Given that the friendly Rush forum (RIP Trinet) died, I've no idea on this one. As any devout Rush fan would tell you, however, don't you want to buy all the Rush albums? You do, really...start in the era you like and buy a couple...Rush is best experienced by album....What? It's only money for 18ish CDs......"
3,Itty bitty files,"Seems to work okay but it breaks up the video into ~10 second pieces when recording HQ (708X480?)@12 FPS. This is about an MByte. These files can be stitched together if you want to play them back with software, such as MS Movie Maker, but is a pretty big PIA.It would be nice to find a file on your SD memory stick that started when you pushed the record button and ended when you pushed stop.It would also be nice if it could use 12V."
4,Expensive but serves its purpose,"Once I figured out how to work it, it works well. The directions are really useless. I still haven't really got the motion detection thing figured out, but it does work. The pictures are not the best but they do serve there purpose. I think if I had looked around a little more I could have found something a little better, but all in all it does its job."
2,Disappointing pictures,"This book was ordered as a house gift for my hosts in CoralGables. The magnificent trees that line their street are notidentifiable among the many ficuses listed. Tree photographs were either a detail of foliage or in total without any quality of detail but not both ways, making it difficult to identify anything already not familiar. The 48 different palms were photographed incompletely and it was difficult even to spot the royal palm by its light, magnificent trunk. For the most part artist illustrations would be preferrable to these photographic limitations.I give it 2 stars only because of the succinct information on the plant descriptions. It would also have been better if the illustrations had not been isolated in the middle of the book ..."
3,white bears and other unwanted thoughts,"I am suffering from ocd. I get uncontrollable bad thoughts all the time. I was looking for a book to help me understand these thoughts. This book may be good to many people but for me, it did not help. You must be a college student or someone with some type of higher education to understand this book. I read it and could not relate to the book."
4,A natural shampoo that has a pleasant smell,I like this shampoo for the reason that it is a natural shampoo with none of the chemicals I can't pronounce. It has a nice smell and leaves my hair squeaky clean.
2,It's okay....i guess,"I thought it would be a great shampoo but the texture and because it doesn't really ""soap"" up on hair you have to add more than regular to get it going. I found that JASON sells a better tea tree shampoo."
2,Very drying,I was not impressed with this shampoo at all. It really dried out my hair and made my scalf itchy. The conditioner from the same line didn't help either.
1,This shampoo HAS Sulfate!!!,"What a scam! Im so tired of purchasing products that claim to be Organic, just to find out they are NOT!!! If you look towards the end of the Ingredients list it contains Olefin Sulfonate!! For those of you complaining of dryness that is why my friends!!"
2,Interesting title with careless content,"This book has a very interesting title and the TOC look great too, but unfortunately the content is carelessly chosen/written. I don't want to repeat the error in the code listings. I just want to mention about design problems in this book.JSP has its born-with problem that it is hard to set boundary for Server Programmer and HTML Programmer. These 2 kinds of work need different skill set. That's why separation of Data and Presention is very important to JSP web site design.The author of this book carefully avoided to include much JSP code in HTML pages, but his design leads to another extreme: almost every control (forms, buttons, links) are generated by JSP code. This approach will create a nightmare for JSP programmers for changing the appearance of the web site.So besides coding error, this book has design issues. I really can't imagine who should be the audience..."
2,A painful read..,"The TOC sounded great, so I bought the book. I hate to reiterate what other reviewers have already said, but it's true: there are so many errors it's rediculous. It was painful to figure out why I wasn't understanding some of the material (for example, the SAME SQL statement produces two DIFFERENT result sets on page 208/209)when in fact it was just a very poorly edited book. The book's topics are perfect - now someone needs to go through it with a pitchfork to weed out all the errors. Not to mention that the example code you can download has been refactored (to put it nicely). It's an expensive lesson in wasted money and time and frustration, but from now on, I'll always check the reviews here before ordering any book."
1,"Poorly written, bad examples, error ridden = Waste!","This is the worst technical book I have ever had the misfortune to read. I was originally excited to purchase the book as the Table of Contents outlined topics I am interested in studying. However, the book is riddled with text and code errors. In fact, the author had the audacity to change the downloadable source code after the book was published. Therefore, you can't even get the code source for the examples in the book, and the new code comes with no instructions! In addition, the author does a poor job of explaining the concepts he is trying to teach. M&T Books should be ashamed for publishing this poorly edited text. I truly feel that I have been swindled by this company/author and would like a full refund. The book is so bad that I will avoid all M&T Books in the future."
5,Ultimate use,"Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated. Nice furniture and practical book shelves. But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around. It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying. But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water."
5,Theology of the Body from birth!,"I have been looking for this book for so long! Our goal is to raise children with healthy sexuality--in line with Theology of the Body, preached by John Paul II. This book is it."
4,Very good but...,"I like this dictionary, and use it often, but I have one complaint worth raising: THE PRINTING. Some of the pages seem to have been printed with too much ink, so ""o"" and ""e"" both look like solid black circles, and bolded ""i"" looks like bolded ""l"". Not a helpful trait in a dictionary!"
3,Not for esoterics,"Granted, I purchased this book because of its carriability, it is not the worst dictionary in the world. It contains a hefty amount of words compared to other compact dictionaries. But, what I traded for succinct entries is what I like about dictionaries: learning the unique history and etymology of a word. Otherwise, this dictionary got me through college."
4,Interseting!,This was the first Time travel story that I have read and I did enjoy it. When Alanna was in the old Ghost town Ghost hunting John McCully suddenly shows up. She is convinced that he is a ghost. The two fight and argue for the first half of the book but it keeps you locked into the book just waiting to see what will happen and who John McCully really is.
4,Super book!,"This wasn't the first time travel romance that I have read, but it was one of the best! Good story line, believable characters, snappy dialoge, and no loose ends (I hate loose ends ina book!) Ms. Stewardson tied them all up. Now I just need to figure out which of her other books are the other time travel stories she mentions in note in the front of the book, I want to read them, too!"
2,"save your money and buy ""weightlifting for dummies""",the book rarely contained any original thoughts by the author. every page had numerous sightings of other people's work. the book was also not presented in an organized manner
4,This book really helped to update my workouts.,I found this book to be very easy to understand and while I was a bit skeptical about only doing one set per excersise after only one week I am noticing results. I have been working out for nine years now but think that this new method will help me get the results I want better. It has allowed me to cut down my workouts from 4 days to 3 and given me more time for cardio work. Despite only 3 days I feel like I got a better workout than when I worked out 4 days. Could have used more diagrams on proper form to use but Istill found this book very helpful.
3,Recommended with some serious caveats,"It's not bad. Just be sure to do your own research and take the things he says about diet and about the ""danger"" of some exercises witha grain of salt.Overall, you'd be hard pressed to do much better for the money, but you definitely can. Of course, reading this book is certainly preferable to reading some silly muscle comic book (that is, stuff like ""Flex"" or ""Muscle and Fitness"") sold from a news stand."
3,Pretty good.,"Brilliant technical playing, but I'll honestly say that I would like to hear all that skill on a different set of pipes. Something about his choice of setup is...harsh-sounding."
1,Not the right one,"I agree with the one above. I got just the Media Player instead of Gameshark codes WITH media player, as is shown in the picture above. I don't know what to do now............."
1,PLAYSTATION GAMESHARK CODES MEDIA PLAYER,"the article offered was not the one that I received, Its descripition is wrong.I am not satisfied with your servicePlease give my money back. the item was returned to you already."
3,Sweet stories.,"I'm giving this 3 stars because my daughter loves it (she's 4) and my son groans (he's 6). There is not too much adventure in Milly-Molly-Mandy's world which is fine for a little one who likes to hear about a girl cooking with her mom and painting gardening tools. It's a by-gone era and some of the words (like a water-butt) are no longer in use so we have no idea what M-M-M is talking about. BUT - the stories are sweet and it's charming and if you're looking for good short stories at bed-time, this is a winner. :)"
1,Inside Wall Street,"This book wasn't very good. In fact, I hated it! It was really boring and the only reason I read it was because my mom made me. She said she wanted me to learn about stock exchange. But oh well. Other people might like it, but I sure didn't!"
2,Missing something,"This book was a part of a set of tapes and the book. The information posted did not reveal this, and I only received the book. The pronunciations and grammar are impossible to learn without examples. The tapes are not available on Amazon.com. The book is of no use."
1,Not bad but,"This is not a bad material, I have had it for some time. But there isn't a whole lot in it. Another thing is the writing system - one can't figure out the pronunciation from it. I wish the book used the standard Lakota spelling as it is used in theNew Lakota Dictionary, that would make is so much better and easier to learn from."
3,"Ok, but . . .","This textbook is great if you want to get a taste of the Lakota language. Unfortunately I did not get the tapes either, but still this is a good text if you are familiar with the sounds of the language. Overall I do not find this text as bad as others have. It does go into some good vocabulary and grammar. It really does pack a bit into this thin volume. Then only thing is that it does not give a ton. It obviously is limited as the size does not allow a lot of expansion on the vocabulary or grammar that is introduced. Thus I will not use this text myself, as I wish to learn more then just a taste of Lakota. However if you don't want to learn a ton of grammar or vocabulary this text is pretty good."
5,excellent,"This is exactly what I needed to really learn the Lakota language. It provides phrases, words, translations and pronunciation guides for them while also explaining the applicable grammatical rules."
5,Excellence in RPG crafting,"This is simply THE landmark by which all RPG setting books should be judge. This is the best execution I have seen in over 23 of gaming. Excellent writing, editing and layout.You may not be a fan of the Realms but this book has more inspiration in it page for penny than any other setting book on the market. This book is an RPG masterpiece!"
4,Astounding depth for setting material,"Apart from asking around as to, ""What the hell ARE the 'Forgotten Realms'?"" on a couple of gaming sites, this was my first exposure to the mythical land of Faern, and I have to say that - in terms of sheer usable material - this book is amazing. From specific alterations to the D&D; 3.X core races and classes to setting pertinent magic and PrCs, there is more information here than I would know what to do with.....which is why I will never in a million years be able to read the entire thing from cover to cover. The fact that the information is available to both player and DM alike for breakdown of culture/economy/geography for the varying different areas of Faern enables quite an immersive play; for me, tho', I think that I would have to read the areas as either I encountered them as a player or the group I was running decided to wander into.An excellent supplement for setting fluff regardless of version of D&D; you intend to play/run. Just...long."
1,Worthless blabber. I would give it half a star if I could.,"This book basically sounds like this, ""Queen Blah-dee Blah-blah-blah of Blah-blah-blah-land ordered her Blah-beep-blop-blah forces to conquer the lands of Blah-dee-blah-blah in the year Blah-dee-blah-blah-blah."" There are absolutely no details worth anything in the book. The only thing that is detailed is the population of each realm which is so unrealistic considering even today it would be difficult to get the exact population of a country or city. Fanboys of Forgotten Realms will probably love this piece of tripe from Ed Greenwood the Grand Mage of High Magic and Multi-Class Nonsense NPC's. I hated it. It's worth about [$$$] to me. The characters in here are ridiculous and the writing in general has no flavor or feel to it at all."
4,"Great book, excellent starting point","This book is great for starting DMs and beginners alike. The Forgotten Realms is my personal favorite for adventures. This is because the place is so well fleshed out. However, I completely agree with all the people who think that it gets boring the second or third time that you get rescued by Mystra's chosen. This setting is just too overpopulated by strong, good characters. The good thing about the setting is that it's well developed. There's a lot of material to go through, and a lot of things that a good DM could flesh out. (It's very hard to come by good epic-level adventures)There are some locations that you can go for quite some time without seeing an allied character in, which is a good thing."
5,Almost Soiled Myself,"My title sums it up right there. Thats how I felt when I started reading this book. It is an excellent buy for anybody playing any edition of D&D! The information is well organized and the book reviews all the lands in Forgotten Realms, not just the core realms that the old campaign settings did. I was extremely impressed with the book! Excellent Buy!"
2,You get what you pay for.,Bought this tent for a 3 night trip...The front door zipper broke the 2nd night and we ended up having to use a tarp for a door the last night and it rained. Luckily we didn't get soaked. I'll go back to using my north face backpacking tent with a bit less space. Instead of this cheap tent.
4,Great for the money!,"I bought this for my Son's backpacking trip for Scouts. Compared to some of the backpacking tents you see at REI or EMS, this one is literally a 10th of the price!!! It's only about 6 pounds and divided between the two Scouts that shared it, that's 3 pounds per Scout in the backpack. Setup is painfully easy especially if you have any experience with tents! I gave 4 starts instead of 5 because we haven't tested it in the rain yet (I'm concerned about the small size of the fly!) and I'm not sure how well it will hold up after several uses.Otherwise, so far so good!!!"
3,to break or not to break,"I love the price, the poles broke the first time we used them, I have yet to purchase new poles.. Cheap."
4,I liked my little tent,"I usually camp with a huge tent, but I needed something just for me for an event I was attending. This tent was SO easy to set up. I'm not used to putting a tent up alone. I thought the tent would be too small when I put my air mattress inside, but it was just right. I wouldn't recommend this tent for 3 people though, unless you are sleeping like sardines. For one person, I fit a queen mattress inside, a cooler and my clothes. It was just right. For 30 bucks, I think it was a deal."
2,You get more than you pay for,"I took this tent to Alaska on the back of my motorcycle. It performed well. Yes, the zipper got stuck a few times - but that has happened on expensive tents. The bottom seems a bit cheap, but it worked for many nights for me. You can set it up in a few minutes and can do so with only one person. I did not get wet in the rain, although we only had a few brief showers. Kept the mosquitos out and that was critical when there were over a thousand trying to get inside when I was in the Yukon. My buddy bought an expensive one person REI backpacking tent and was cramped for space in his. This has plenty of room for two or for one and a lot of gear. This is not a backpacking tent, though. Too heavy. Be sure and bring a tarp to put down underneath and you can save the tent's bottom from dirt, rocks and sticks."
4,Great for the price,"I've taken this tent camping twice. It's very easy to set up, and I haven't really had the same zipper problems some other reviewers have mentioned. I haven't expected much, because of the price, but the tent delivers every time. The big surprise this year: we had a pretty serious rain storm, and my stuff and I stayed totally dry with the rain fly on. Not even a drop inside."
4,Camping for 2,I used this tent with my young son. We didnt' have a chance to waterproof it before the first use. I liked the fact that the floor seams were up higher in the air so no water came in. It rained that night and the tent kept out the water pretty good except when something touched the edge. The zipper worked fine for me as long as I took my time to open and close it carefully. It's a pretty good tent for the money but I will be waterproofing it before the next trip. There was just enough room for my son and I and a few bags of clothes. Anymore than that it would be crowded.
4,Good buy for $25,"I bought this for backyard camping. If that is what you are doing, this tent is fine for it! I slept comfortably by myself, and 2 would have fit nicely. 3? I don't think so. I liked the mesh on both sides and top, which left the breeze in when I felt stuffy in the morning. The only problem I had with this was that one of my stakes bent already (could have hit a rock), and the tent flapped around a bit, but this could have been human error, as I don't camp much. I thought it was fine for me, however, for only $25!"
3,Okay,"It rained and the inside of the tent walls were wet and damp in the morning. Floor however was dry. Fit's two people comfortably, could not imagine a 3rd"
1,for clear weather only,"the rain fly is too small to cover enough place of the tent. the tent itself is not water proof. if any part of body or sleeping bag touch the wall of the tent, the water will get in. the night I did camping had a light rain. In the morning, I found my sleeping bag was wet!Cannot complain too much based on its price. It would be a good deal if the rain fly were larger."
4,great for dry nights,"very nice, very easy for one person to set up (but not to get back into the bag- I used one from another tent), but I did use seam sealer and it still leaked from below the front zipper when it rained (the rest stayed dry and it probably leaked less than the other tents that night)"
3,windy night,used the tent on a camping trip and it got pretty windy on us. i had the supplied stakes in it and the tent held up nice. the stitching is good and it only takes about 15 min to set up. it has some storage in side too. in all i think that i will get some good use out of this.
1,Worked once-Cheap piece of garbage!,We used this tent once. Then tried to use it again 1 month later and the poles were ruined. the elastic string in the center that snaps the poles together was frayed and broken after 1 use. The metal sheathing that the poles insert into each other with seems to be a design flaw. We think that they contributed to the fraying of the string. Fortunately the camp ground was close to a walmart and we were able to buy a new tent. very disappointing. I bought this because of all the glowing reviews. I hope this review helps in your decision. You get what you pay for.
4,My First Dome Tent,"I've been hiking and camping before, but never in an enclosed tent. I've used tarp tents and open sleeping bags, but no dome tents. I ended up getting this one, and for a first one, it's a pretty good tent.PROS:1. Easy to set up2. Comes in a compact size3. Love the color4. Nice little net at top of tent for putting a light or keys.5. Lots of room for two people6. Kids would love it.7. Good price.CONS:1. The stakes are thin and bend easily when malleting it in the ground. I suggest getting a better quality stake set.2. No pockets anywhere inside tent, for wallet, keys, etc.3. Could be a little small for people over 5'10""4. Might be a little thin and weak for harsh weather. I suggest only using for non-rainy days."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,DID NOT PURCHASE THIS SPECIFIC TENT. THE WENZEL TENT I BOUGHT FELL APART THE 2ND TIME I USED IT. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE COULD ONLY CALL ME A LIAR. THIS WAS MY 8TH TENT. I AM AN AVID CAMPER.
2,Worked perfect for my first camping trip But craped out on the second,This tent was delivered promptly. I first used it for a three day camping trip where it rained two days. Everything stayed dry I was very pleased. The second and last time I used the tent was on a six day camping trip. It held up well until the fourth night while unzipping the tent one of the poles snapped and tore through the top of the tent. I was not able to fix the tent and had to throw it in the garbage. Luckily I had a spare two person tent a friend gave me when they moved out of state. I'm very sad that I only got few days worth out of it. I will spent more money on my next purchase for a more reliable tent.
3,fair one,"Length:: 0:17 MinsJust back from camping in death Vally.the fiberglass poles was good for two tenting session. next time the plastic tip fall of the poles, next was themetal tube separated from poles.easy to use but very poor fiberglass poles."
3,Too small if you have an air mattress,"I will know more as time goes on, but the first night the tent was up, it rained and quite a bit of water got inside. Now, I didn't use seam sealer, but we did spray the tent with a waterproofer that didn't seem to help.A six-foot air mattress extends to touch both sides of the tent, and the rain fly barely covers the ventilation screens, making the tent extremely drafty. Probably an excellent hot weather tent as long as you're not expecting rain."
4,Good little tent,"This tent worked pretty well on a few rainy motorcycle trips. Packs up small enough to roll inside of my foam bed mat. Easy to set up. Did not leak during moderate rainstorms after coating entire tent with water-proofing spray. Would not recommend for more than 2 peaople, unless you're really comfortable sleeping right up against them. Would buy again for this use and price."
4,Great tent for hiking,"Used it for hiking and camping in the woods, it worked great, quick set up and very lite so it was easy to carry."
1,worse tent ever,this tent is for 2 kids only. very very small. installation is not easy and it getting wet if it is raining. DO NOT BUY IT.
2,Pinon tents,"I received 5 tents, all shipped individually, which was rediculous. All 5 tents flys leak at the seams. I called the mfg. They suggest I go buy some seam sealer and put on. New tents should not leak at the seams or anyplace else"
5,AC/DC shirt,"the shirt was delivered ontime and was new as described , also thank you for delivering to APO addresses!!!"
5,Very Good Product,"Shipped super fast and definitely the right price. These silicone hider plugs matched my skin tone very well; inserted easily due to their being hollow and flexible, yet firm enough to retain their shape. You hardly feel them and almost forget you're pierced with just a casual glance in the mirror. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants to make their gauged ears less noticeable for any reason."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed reading this material,I read some of the reviews prior to reading the book. I felt that Mr. Newnam's comments were quite helpful while Dominiques were not. The book conveys information that was very useful for the research I am currently involved in. I felt the format of the book made it very easy to follow and it kept my interest throughout.
3,Maybe I just missed something...?,"Of the three serial murderer books that I purchased, this was by and large my least favorite. The pictures included were great and unique, but I found a lot of the text to be redundant with a knack for overstating the obvious. Perhaps I was just expecting a different writing style?"
5,OH YES!!!!,I first read this book when I was around 10. This book became my life. I wanted to be that soul that was born into an ordaniry world and then ventured out and found magic and faries. You must read this book. You should then read it with your kids. I have with mine and they loved it. Not only does it have a great story but the illustrations are amazing. I read it again when I was 26 and the story still had the same magic.
2,"Historical with explicit sex, 80's style!","I bought this book at a 79c bargain bin when I was 13 and it subsequently did the rounds of all my friends, their friends and their friends! This novel is a historical 'Jackie Collins' style sex romp set in Morocco. It smacks too much of Johanna Lindsey's 'Captive Bride' but minus the romantic prose. The heroine is way ahead of her time - a spoilt English miss who ends up having wild sex with a few guys (not just the brooding hero shiek she ends up with). This novel is not for the 'flowers and hearts' reader, as there are liberal and explicit uses of 'penis' and 'vagina' as well as bondage, drugging and group sex scenes."
4,peaceful mind,This is a wonderful start to the world of tibet chanting.If you are new to this or not it will grab you.Done with all its traditions in tact.If you like to meditate this will be perfect to listen to while meditation or before you begin.If you want to hear deep throat chanting the GYUTO monks will be perfect.That is the most intense chanting you can hear.Enjoy and open your mind.Peace and happiness to all sentient beings.
5,MONTEREY,"One of the most interesting and well covered histories I have ever read.I am from a Monterey Family and I love to see anything about Monterey done with care-with love, for what Monterey really is.Augustina Fink's book is a treasure!GodspeedLee Rice"
5,The only book on learning from history,"The authors teach a highly influential course, ""Reasoning from History"" at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. The book has great case studies of real decisions based, sometimes well, sometimes badly, on historical precedent. A wonderful book."
1,G I watch,upon opening the can I was impressed with the looks of the watch. on inspection I was very disappointed in the quality the watch was made in china. the glass was not glass but plastic and the first time I wore it it scrached. the strap pins popped out when I put the watch on snug and put my shirt on over it. very disappointed in something that cost me over 50 bucks.
4,Nice watch,"It's great that there is no batteries to hassle with. Big face, large numbers. The only downside for me is the 'made in china' at the bottom of the face. But other than that so far so good."
2,was okay until it fell off my wrist and broke,"Wore it for a few weeks. Loved it. It fell off my wrist while wrestling with a friend (justifiably so), but then when it fell, it totally broke. Clock hands tumbling around loose inside the watch. I would have imagined that it could have sustained at least a drop from waist-high. It wasn't like I threw it on the floor."
2,disappointed,"I was excited to get this watch but disappointed in it. It was not as easy to read as the picture and discription implied and within two months I dropped it from my wrist as I was buckling it. It landed on the stem, breaking it internally, and making it worhtless. I went to several jewlers looking for a repair only to find that none could do so in my area, and if I had found a clockmaker/repairer who would work on it the cost to repair was prohibitive, far more than getting a new watch. So, not as rugged as stated, and not repairable..."
4,Cool watch,"It's not often that you can find a hand-wind watch that's not a luxury model anymore. I don't know why, the technology has existed for a couple hundred years now. Anyway, when I saw this hand-wind watch at an inexpensive price, I figured it would be a good addition to my collection. Haven't been disappointed, but maybe that's cause I wasn't expecting much.It does seem a little cheap. Who knows how long it will last? But again, it's something different, and I like that."
5,Exactly What I Wanted at a Great Price,"I've been searching for an old-fashioned wind-up watch because I'm tired of buying watch batteries and having the old ones end up in a land fill. This is exactly what I wanted. Plus the band isn't leather, which I won't buy, and it's not plastic which I also don't like. And olive happens to be one of my favorite colors. The trick is getting used to winding a watch every morning again. But it's worth it to not have to buy batteries anymore."
1,It almost keeps time,"I'm sick of my watches sitting on my nightstand because the batteries are dead so I got this.Eh, I've had it two weeks and I've found it loses about 3 minutes a week, maybe a little more."
3,Made in China,"Received this product today. It is made in China, but oddly the metal tin the watch is packaged in is stamped:Watch, WristMIL-W-0836F-TYPE3NSN 0423-00-120-1128Mechanical MovementGeneral PurposeType, VietnamThe MILSPEC and NSN nomenclatures intrigued me, so I called Rothco (the importer). They told me the MILSPEC, NSN, and other information printed on the package is for marketing purposes only and does not indicate the watch is manufactured to these standards.I've not seen this marketing approach anywhere else (where fake US government markings are used to identify a product)."
5,Grandson Loved it!!,"My son had a set years ago, I still have it. this one is much smaller but it is well played with"
2,Not a whole lot of variation in up-tempo songs,"The arrangements are incredibly repetitious to my ear. The first 3 songs have virtually the same tempo and beat pattern.If you like that and lots of synth, you'll love this CD. I think buyers should be sure they preview it before buyings."
1,Christmas Treasures~~ Mehdi,"I am very disappointed with this CD. To me, it sounds as though someone playing with a keyboard went through and picked out the background music which is very repetative, then added the actual Christmas songs. Very Disappointing!!! If you want something really good, stick with TSO or Gary Hoey."
3,Christmas...elevator style!,"What can I say that hasn't been already said? Mehdi is the master of elevator music. This totally reminds me of shopping at the mall during Christmas when I was a kid. These hackneyed recreations of yuletide favorites are sure to have a somnolent effect on your family or guests. The best part of 'Christmas Treasures' is that you can set the CD player to play continuously in the background, and you will have no idea how many times the disk has played because each song blends into the next with very little variation. Great work Mehdi. We'll be spinning this disk after everyone has eaten and settles down for a nap."
1,RUN AWAY!!!,"I purchased this after reading the reviews. I was thinking ""Yanni..., maybe even Manheim Steamroller"", WRONG!!!If disco is your thing, maybe, go for it. The best word I can come up with to describe this is... CHEESY. It sounds like the forty dollar keyboard my mother bought for my kids. It has a ""play along with"" button that supplies accompaniment with known songs including Christmas. Perhaps Mehdi should not have used the freeware accompaniment software that came with the midi soundcard interface. Yes, it is that bad. This disk is destined for the bin where I keep all the AOL disks that I use for target practice. The only other possible use I can think of is to send it to the Pentagon to send to Iraq. They could play it over loud speaker while surrounding Fallujah (SP?). The terrorists should come running out screaming in short order. Please, give our troops plenty of hearing protection. Perhaps someone could possibly like these recordings. The only thing they envoked in me was nausea."
5,Wonderful Fun For People Of All Ages,"At Christmas time in my home, Mehdi, Mannheim Steamroller and Trans Siberian Orchestra rule the sound system. I own all of the Mehdi CD's, and I have been unable to choose a favorite, unless it would be Christmas Treasures. Mehdi's unique blend of new age sound results in a truly magical experience that you have to hear to believe. Each album contains something for everyone, whether it be relaxing mood music, or a jazzed up version of ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing."" He includes many melodies with Renaissance touches, and the kids especially like his version of Rudolph on Christmas Treasures 2, as you can actually ""hear"" Santa's sleigh fly from one end of the house to the other! This collection is a must for every home."
3,"SOUNDS LIKE ""HOOKED OF CHRISTMAS"".....","I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS. IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE ""HOOKED ON"" CDS. LIKE HOOKED OF BACH, OR HOOKED ON CLASSICS. BUT IF YOU LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS CD."
5,One of the best Christmas CDs,"I own many Christmas CDs. This is one of the best of my collection. The variation among the songs is incredible. Some songs get you in a bright, fun, dancing mood with a fast tempo, and a cool rythym and beat, while others bring you back to a serene state as they remind you of the true meaning of Christmas. It's already a classic- I listen to this CD year round, it's that good. The samples only tell you half the story. The quality of the CD makes the songs much better. This is one of the best Christmas CDs out there and I'm here today picking up a few for friends."
5,Fantastic renditions of popular holiday Favorites...,"Every song on this is outstanding, these are wonderful renditions of popular favorites. I have purchased a few of these CDs as stocking stuffers for all of my family that have heard this album in my car and quickly wanted one..."
1,No musicians were consumed in the production of this product,"This is electronically synthesized, disco pop trash. Fits right in with the pop-culture christmas of today I suppose. Don't purchase without listening to the samples."
5,Just gotta have it !,"The Free Download ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman"" is a must hear to believe type of song. I loved the entire CD from start to finish and now Im back to pick up a few more as stocking stuffers. This is one of those Christmas CDs that wont end up in your used CD pile ... Very highly recommended !"
5,A Christmas Favourite,I originally came across this title on Amazon and heard it in the shopping mall in 2002. It had all the shoppers humming. I have played it every christmas since. It contains some of our favourite chritmas songs with a bit of a swing to make them sound that little bit different. Everyone who hears this music enjoys it.
1,Chritmas on caffeine,"After I read the glowing review by a self-proclaimed national music programmer, I was anxious to hear the instrumental genius known as Mehdi. What a disappointment. Instead of fresh new takes on yuletide classics I got Christmas on caffeine. The persistent background beat on display in even the most traditional and sedate carol rendered them unrecognizable and frankly annoying beyond all reason. I highly recommend this album if you wish to be even more stressed out than you were from your last minute Christmas shopping. Drink up!"
5,Upbeat Classic !,"This is an upbeat classic that will compare to no other x-mas albums. It not only fills my mind with the images of a dancing santa, it embodies what christmas is all about. This album always reminds me of a fresh winter day with big snowflakes falling to the ground effortlessly, like the music.The piano playing is impeccable and the flute is soothing. This will inspire piano players to learn to play. It is upbeat and clever. It is always amazing to great music like this with minimal instruments. This goes to show you of the quality of these instrumental stylings.This and his 2nd Christmas CD are a must for any collection."
1,Alpine garden lights problem,"There was a wire that had not been connected and therefore the lights would not work. After several emails to Amazon and sending a picture of the lose wire, I was informed the item was no longer available and given a refund for my purchase."
3,Not as good as Headcleaner,"It's a good CD, more varied than the normally relentless (yet brilliant) Flying Rhino stuff...well produced, spartan and restrained, which is atypical of the usual Goa overload."
3,Good reading but the movie is better,I enjoyed reading this book up to a point. Of the three I think it is the best but the emphasis on Bourne's psychological suffering got to be a little tedious for me.
3,"While the company was quick to refund and email me, the item was out of stock","About 2 hours after ordering the item, I received an email stating that they no longer had the item in stock and that they had issued a refund. I did receive the refund shortly and they offered me a small discount should I buy a book from them again, though I don't know that I will."
2,Disappointed,I thought I was buying all three books as listed in the description. Only one of the books was actually shipped to me: The Bourne Identity. What happened to the other two books?
2,Oy Vay,"Interesting for the insights into Jewish society and history, but I found the extended dialogues between and among the investigators and the witnesses tedious, the dialogue between Michael and his love interest just bizarre. At times I had difficulty following the discussion and the actions of the speakers-perhaps a translation difficulty, but nontheless distracting from the flow of the story."
3,Hoping the stilted dialogue was from a bad translation,"This was a predictable mystery grafted on to an interesting exploration of ethnicity and culture in Jeruselem. I wasn't terribly interresetd in the characters, but the backdrop was facinating; I can't help but feel like the ""mystery"" (the true killer was pretty obvious from first introduction) was an afterthought. Readable, but I was glad I got it from the library."
4,Excellent book,"This book is an easy read, packed with information. Written in essay style, the three compliment each other well. Overall well researched and well presented! Recommended!"
3,good read,"this man is a lawyer, and he writes like one. at first this style takes a bit of getting used to as it seems many times he is arguing both sides of the arguement. this all in all is probably a good thing as it gives you a bigger overview of diffrent models, but so often i wanted to know what the author himself, an experienced church planter, recommended. he raises a lot of good questions to get us thinking, but doesn't always give answers. some of you may want this, others of you may be looking for something to give clearer direction rather then a (very good and very detailed) overview of differing view points related to ecclesiology."
2,Five Stars?,"Doesn't anybody who has so far reviewed this book have a problem that the author gives away endings? I mean, being a horror aficionado, I had seen most of the movies represented in this book, but if I hadn't seen them, I would have been considerably upset at having the endings to such classics as ""Psycho"" ruined. Additionally, I find that the book is occasionally awkwardly written. It's quite accessible though, even for casual fans of horror and the list of movies and people/characters critical to the genre is comprehensive.2.5/5"
5,Highly recommended,"Reading this book is like shopping while hungry: everything will look good to you. You'll come away from this book with several dozen films you want to see, many of them foreign. Great trivia, like the line 'Don't step on it, it might be Lon Chaney.' (He was apparently known for his commitment to creature effects in the days before CGI)."
1,Kindle edition linked here is for an old edition,"This is an excellent anthology. The content is great.Amazon has a Kindle edition linked that is the 1998 version of this anthology with different texts. Please note that the Kindle edition also does not have page numbering which will be necessary if you are using for a class, citing in a paper, etc.Make sure to check the edition you purchase."
1,I don't think so...,Other than the pictures I just didn't like this book at all. It is a little to pretentious for me. It makes one wonder about the qualifications of this Preziosi fellow.
2,"A valiant, but only partially successful effort","The New Oxford History of Art represents the first massive effort to rethink this field in detail since Nikolaus Pevsner launched the Pelican History fifty years ago. The volumes are well printed, advantageously priced, and generally refreshing in their point of view. Preziosi's volume is sui generis in that instead of dealing with a period or theme, it is a second order study--of the study of art history. It combines an anthology with interspersed commentary. Unfortunately, the Preziosi commentary, demonstrating the author's effort to find a new approach, is marred by opaque language and a sketchy presentation of ideas. For example, he says that one of his approaches will be based on the principle of the anamorphic image. Although he reproduces one by Holbein, he does not adequately explain it. Still, for those with an interest in the subject this volume is worth struggling with."
4,Delightful Reading,"""Death of a Cad"" is just one book in a series about a Scottish Constable, named Hamish Macbeth, who lives in a small town in Scotland. The descriptions of the town and the residents are excellent and the story lines are simple, but plausible.If you enjoy light mysteries with a background of Scottish scenery, you will enjoy this book and the many others in the series. Probably these series of books would be enjoyed more by women than men."
4,Death of a Cad,"This was a very intertaining book, as are all of M.C. Beaton's books The storylines keep me coming back for more. The Hamish Macbeth books are my favorites. A good mix of mystery and humor."
5,A real treasure itself,"A beautiful book that explores some truely fascinating stories. It is more ""grown up"" than Pickford's other book ""The Atlas of Shipwreck and Treasure"". The Atlas, although enjoyable, always left me wanting to know a lot more. In this book each story is clearly meticulously researched and presented in far more detail. This creates a far more satisfying read. Many historians can write interestingly about their subject, however, Pickford not only achieves this, but has a captivating style which most fiction writers should be jealous of! This book is one that you'll want to continually re-read, it has certainly become one of my favourites."
3,Good but quick ideas,I ordered this book in hopes that I could use the ideas in the book as lesson for childrens church. The book has lotso f idea but most of them only take a few minutes to complete. A good suplement book for any bible lessons.
3,I found that ideas are outdated,"The book is very busy, but the ideas where outdated, and not what I was looking for in Christian Education Ideas. Also, I was disappointed because the ideas did not meet my need for younger children, it was more for school age chidren"
4,Biblical Archaeology Magazine,The first issue was very interesting and look forward to the next one.
4,Learning about our predecessors,"This is a fascinating picture of life in ancient times, in the lands of the Bible. The inhabitants, our predecessors, accomplished much even though they had little to work with."
2,Better choice for believers---Bible and Spade,"If you consider the Bible to be the inerrant word of God and are looking for an archaeology magazine with a truly biblical viewpoint you would be far better off with ""Bible and Spade"" magazine from Associates for Biblical Research (just do a search for Bible and Spade and the link should pop up). They have quite a few interesting past articles posted on the website to give you an idea of what to expect."
5,Condition as stated,Bowl was in new condition as stated and delivered promptly. Would definetly do business with again.
4,Entertaining Read!,"Delightfully entertaining, but lacking in the suspense area. This was a very good story with characters you really come to care about. Especially Raphael. His story tugged at my heart with every turn, as well as Jade's. It was so good to see her triumph in the end. Getting the kind of life and love she so deserved."
4,Out of the Dark,"Sam Cochrane never dreamed how his life would change. One moment he was a happily married man with a beautiful 6 year old daughter, the next he was a man destroyed by his inability to find the wife and child who had disappeared. For twenty years Sam searched for his family.Meanwhile, 6 year old Jade Cochrane, left behind when her mother died, is forced into child prostitution by Solomon, evil personified. Solomon is the leader of the cult Children of Joy. After a nearly fatal knife attack by one of the predators who paid for sex, Jade is rescued by her friend Raphael.Bits of mystery, paranormal activity, and familial love, plus the horrid world of child prostitution, are all revealed in this moving and exciting novel. I couldn't put it down!"
3,good writing but lacks suspense,"This most recent offering by Sharon Sala is more akin to a morality play than a suspense novel. The culprits are evident from the start and the outcome is never in question. The protagonist, Jade, the long lost daughter of wealthy entrepreneur Sam Cochrane now reunited with her adoring father is almost too good and virtuous to be true. How could someone grow up on the streets without a single vice? Even her 'flaws' only seem to make her more attractive to the handsome and successful private eye, Luke Kelly, who finds and often rescues her. Her protective and beautiful long time friend, Raphael, who is dying of aids is likened to Jesus on several occasions and he along with other cast members often spouts spiritual advice. The story though sappy at times moves quickly to a satisfying conclusion but it is not Sala's most memorable work. If you are looking for pure romance then add a star because Sala's writing is always beautiful and the romance plentiful."
4,Ritual Abuse in Romance?,"I am very pleased Sharon Sala tried to touch on the very basics of what Ritual Abuse can do to a person. I am a survivor of a multi-generationaly abusive family, and a survivor of Satanic Ritual Abuse. No one is going to full expose all the ramifications of this type of abuse and the intiricacies involved in one short romance novel. My biggest problem with the plot was Jade ""making love"" so quickly without a lot of therapy. We are reading fiction here, fantastic heroes and loving families can accomplish almost anything within the walls of a book. I am just pleased this topic was handled at all. If anyone has complaints with the plot or characterizations they need to fully understand how to put a complex and controversial subject into a small romance novel, let alone completely understand what this type of abuse does to a person."
4,out of the dark,"This book kept me interested from page 1. Another book that Sharon Sala has been able to make the characters believable, and you can't help wanting to help them yourself. This is about the 5th book of hers that I have read and I loved everyone of them!"
4,okay cameras,"I bought these to take on my trip in June to Tennessee, or I intended to. The seller didn't get them to me until I returned. I have taken some pictures with them around the house just to see how they worked and haven't had them developed yet."
1,Garbage,I gave this product one star because I had to give it some kind of rating to give this review. DON'T BUY THESE CAMERAS!!!! My two pack came and I shot all the film of my daughter and her new baby. These are pictures I cannot replace and the film was either too old or just ruined. Out of two cameras I got not one sinlge picture.
4,Great for the wedding,"I purchased 4 of these and have only developed 2 so far. Most of the pictures came back really great, just what you'd expect from a single use camera. The flash seemed to work well."
2,Fujifilm Quicksnap single use camera,"The cameras were purchased to take candid pictures of my son and daughter in law's wedding. It was nice to have actual photos very quickly. However, it was expensive to develop the cameras and only a small percentage were usable. Some were too dark, others were overexposed. I would probably stick with the digital camera in the future and just pick from there the pictures I want developed. These cameras were a disappointment."
4,Just what I wanted!,"Haven't used this yet, but had these in the past and they work for me. I'm sure these will do the same."
1,"Very cheap, not durable","The metal (I assume it is tin) is so thin, barely thicker than tin foil. If you actually want to use this lunch box for carrying your lunch to work or school each day, you'll be lucky to get a month out of it. It will dent incredibly easy and the latches will no longer easily line up. A shame, really, because the lunch box looks very nice. Unfortunately, it's just extremely poorly made and is not worth the money. You'd be better off finding a good steel dome lunch box and putting a pirate sticker on it."
1,cute but very cheap and flimsy!,"this lunchbox looks better on the website than in reality. Its alot smaller than I thought it would be, and it is VERY cheap and flimsy. There is no way this can last more than ONE semester of school - and that's with a kid being extra careful with it!! I thought there would at least be a strap inside to hold the drink bottle at the top of the lunchbox. There is no strap so needless to say my 5 y-o would have a hard time putting his containers and water bottle back in after he has finished eating. I dont think I will give him this for school, he'll just use it at home for a toy treasure chest. bummer!"
1,Great for pirate lovers but wont last!!,"This lasted a VERY short time...first the handle went, then the metal closures. MAde so cheaply...not worth the money. Why buy another thing that will end up in the landfill? Save your money and buy something that is quality and insulated. This doesnt keep anything cold even with a coldpack."
2,Cute but not durable,I bought two for each of my boys. They loved the look of them and thought they we super cool lunch boxes. I agree but they aren't going to last long because they are cheaply made...Amazon was great to purchase through though...it shipped fast and everything on that end went smooth...just wish the product was better made.
4,Changed over the years,I just bought this as a replacement for one that was stolen. It's different than the original I've been using for the last fifteen years. The body is a light colored aluminum and the filler cap is darker. like my original. The wind up crank seems thinner (read cheaper) and just doesn't seem to have the same quality feel of the original. The locking button is also finiky and doesn't slide as easily as the first one. The unit does what it's supposed to do but I can't help but to be a bit disappointed with the thinner parts. I give it 4 stars but the original gets 5 stars all day long.
4,Great Pow-wow music,"Northern Cree remains one of the most popular pow-wow drums in the U.S./Canada and this CD shows you why. This CD was recorded live from Kamloops, BC and has a great variety of dance songs. Northern Cree has a fast upbeat style that keeps your toes tapping. This is a great CD to listen to at home, in the car or to practice a few new dance moves."
1,No idea how much solder,"There is no indication how much solder is actually in package. Never buy a ""pig in a poke"" type thing.Ken H"
5,Great read,"Great book. A very comprehensive look at his life, with some material and pictures I've never seen before. We,ll designed, and obviously well researched. Equally good for newcomers or die-hard fans."
4,Good book to introduce children,The book provided a nice summary of Bruce Lee's life. I learned some things about his life that never crossed my mind. My son used it for a book report so it worked out fine.
2,Not very reliable,"This is a nice system. Unfortunately, we only use this for long trips and only make those 2-3 times per year. So, when we went to use for the 3rd time, we were well out of the 90 day warranty. One of the units screens stopped funtioning. It's very disappointing to only get 2 trips out of a system that cost a couple hundred dollars. I guess I would recommend this product but only if a long warranty was purchased with it."
1,Units died. VERY DISSAPOINTING - Shame on Audiovox!,"We bought these units during the 2008 holidays on the recommendation of a friend. The kids were sooo excited. The units worked well at first, although the sound was never great. We used them three times during the past 5 months for car trips; and the last time we tried to use them (returning from our last trip) they just died. We tried replacing the fuse to the car adapter which we read on the net was a common problem with the units, but to no avail. I wish I had read these reviews before I made the decision to spend $200. We feel like we've been robbed."
3,Good for the price,"Just installed the system in our Toyota Sienna today.. Both the units can function as a stand alone, or be slaved together for 1 dvd 2 screens. This will be a handy feature for kids movie on one screen, older movie on another in seperate rows.The audio is via a single small speaker, but when both are in use, its acceptable quality in a quiet car. The option is there via a seperate cable (sold seperately) for plugging it into external audio (like car speakers), or plug into the handy headphone jack.My biggest gripe is that the video screen on the 'slave' unit is a much lower quality then the main screen... this is not due to calbes, etc.. as a dvd played on the unit itself has fuzzy lines, etc.. what a shame to cut corners there.The av jacks are standard size, so feel free to bring your own length of cable for longer runs... the supplied power cables are very long."
4,Good for the price,"Just bought this a few days ago from Target on sale for $199. I bought the 3 yr protection plan for an extra $19--figure you can't go wrong. I'm expecting good reliability from Audiovox. The unit works great. I like how you have the option of playing two separate dvd's. The picture quality is good, the audio is fair. It doesn't have an internal battery so you can only plan it with AC and DC current. The remote controls only work when pointing at the units from the back seat, not from pointing at the rear of the unit from the front seat. This makes it tough when sitting in the front seat and trying to make adjustments. Overall it's a great alternative to having an overhead installed DVD player for $700-$1,500...plus you can move it from car to car."
2,"built well, but poor sound","Unit is solid and the picture is good, but the audio system is underpowered. The built in speaker is tiny, and the internal amp makes it hard to hear in a noisy car even with headphones. (non-noise canceling cheap ones anyway).I'm going to return my unit. I've been very happy with AudioVox in the past, I'm surprised this unit got through basic testing. I anticipated the problem when I put in a DVD in my living room, before I even tried it in the car.Note: Unit doesn't come with a 120V adapter, but does have a stand for putting it on a table. Presumably you can use any 12V adapter that fits."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this product at Target for around $200 last summerand didn't even use it often because it was two pieces of junk . After the first one fried itself along with my DVD, we figured we had another one to use so whatever...Surprise, surprise, the second one just imploded. You shake it and you can hear all the parts rattling around inside. It was a disaster from day one. You could never hear it and the picture quality was always poor. Didn't even last 6 months before both screens broke. A terrible, substandard product. I don't even want to give it one star but I have no choice because one star is the lowest I can rate it! Buyer beware!"
1,Warning-Not enough audio sound,"I purchased this unit from Target. The video is great,kids can watch two separate movies, etc. but all of that doesn't matter because they can't hear them. Even bought good quality ear phones & there is not enough sound to hear in a moving vehicle."
1,What A Good Joke!,"This is a hilarious book filled with lies. Or it would be, if the disinformation it spread weren't taken seriously by so many idiots! Furthermore, it is sacrilege to use the word Holocaust to describe the altogether appropriate and proper treatment of people who send suicide bombers to kill innocent Israelis and fire rockets into their land."
1,Wartime Propaganda,"As explained in an earlier review, Arab populations have been increasing in Israel, not decreasing. We're not seeing a mass exodus or extermination of Arabs. I can only wonder why Hoffman did not choose to bemoan the fate of the Germans in World War 2: surely the huge number of German deaths would to him have been proof of a Jewish genocide of the Nazis, rather than the contrary.When Jewish populations in the Levant began to increase in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries due to the success of modern Zionism, Arabs tended to move to regions of high Jewish population. And Arab populations have tended to increase in those areas since then. This is at odds with a hypothesis that Arabs are being strongly oppressed there! Truly oppressed people would try to avoid that region or even flee it.In summary, this book has little to do with logic or facts. It seems that the author had a different agenda in mind, namely a malicious attack on the Jews of Israel."
1,Congradulations!!,"I just wanted to Congradulate Mr. Hoffman for rallying his antisemetic troops...Thanks to him and those like him who distort information, we are on the brink of war...Many of the case studies have been magnified to such an extent that the true situation at hand becomes blurred. A message to Mr. Hoffman: Israel has done a great deal to secure the free country you so blatantly take advantage of...If you're not happy, feel free to move to the Islamic Republic of Iran, I'm sure you're considered a hero there!!"
4,An unpleasant but necessary truth to see,"Years ago when I was a student a black South African friend told me if he had to chose he would rather live under apartheid in South Africa than as Palestinian in the occupied West Bank. I asked him why and he replied,""I have a future as my oppression will be over in my lifetime""It is very hard for many to be objective about anything involving Israel. Nevertheless if one wants to learn a bit more about the dark side of the never ending Israel-Palestine conflict I recommend this book as a good start. It is a little sensational, but no less accurate in fairly reporting what one will ever see in the mainstream US media about the powerful vs. the powerless."
1,absurd!!!,"If you know anything about the truth and history of the war between the Arabs and Jews, this book will make you angry!!!!"
1,"This guy is a Holocaust denier,","Why would anybody buy this tripe? There has never been a holocaust against the Palestinians except the one they brought on themselves. Palestinian terrorists blow themselves up to kill innocent women and children in Israel, they shoot their guns in the air not caring if the bullets are going to come back to earth and hurt someone, Hamas pays children to carry weapons and throw pipe bombs, they brainwash their young from the earliest ages to murder people who only want to live peacefully in their homeland.This book should have the name ""The Palestinian Propaganda Holocaust Against the Israelis""."
1,"Very, very sad","It is sad that anybody could believe the kind of thing that is written in this book, let alone write a book like this. Nevertheless, here it is. Boring, typical antisemitic trash written by, and for, the likes of people that can actually blame Ariel Sharon for something that (supposedly) occured in 1982 and say that the state of Israel ""Assassinated"" an eighteen year old child (Scroll up to Yousef Hani's review). If you have some respect for yourself, don't insult your intelligence by purchasing this book."
3,Human rights,"I find it rather amusing that each review criticizing this book begins by brushing it off as garbage, dismissing the issues it is trying to bring up and then immediately refer to it as essentially anti-semitic. I'm not going to get into the politics of a situation that has existed for over 50 years and cost many on both sides their lives, or stoop to an even lower level and use some catch phrase like ""tripe"" which does nothing to deal with the issues that are being brought up in this book. Palestine is and always will be about the violation of the human rights of one people by another. For those who would like proof, I suggest checking the United Nations web page."
3,Mostly for the Trekker crowd,"Although there was some scattered coverage of what may interest me while I am traveling in Nepal, I feel that the filmmaker is really appealing to the younger 'trekker' crowd in this film. I was looking for coverage of the architecture, customs and people as the cover of the DVD may suggest, but was really 'turned off' by the gross out factor of the chicken slaughter and the sadhu stone lifting segment.(It would have to have a PG-13 rating). The motorcycle and river rafting segments would also be appreciated by the more adventurous crowd. I guess I was really looking for more culture, peace, and OHM...."
2,"Great Historic Value, Not So Great Sound Value","I like that Toscanini conducts these pieces relatively quickly. It makes both symphonies more dramatic. The sound quality is muddy and may actually be mono. There is a background hiss to it, as well. Toscanini recorded these symphonies on VJ Day and VE Day, which adds to the value of them. I just wish the sound were better."
2,fiesta serving bowl,The bowl is a good size and looks like a fiesta bowl but it did not have any markings on the bottom that should have been there.
4,great size!,I love this bowl! It is perfect for dinners and party settings. I can serve a large variety in here for the family gatherings. It is great for serving vegetables as the name implies. It compliments the rest of the fun festive colors of the fiesta ware that I have!
3,Much Much Darker than Picture,"This is a real colbalt almost black blue. It is still nice but really dark. Not great for my decor but too much trouble to return. However that said it is really heavy and well made. I also bought yellow, scarlett and shamrock and those are much truer to the the pictures"
3,Too small,"Though I love Fiestaware, this particular piece is a little small for use as a serving dish. It's an odd size and if I hadn't received it free with the purchase of a place setting, I don't think I would spend money on it."
5,Forget the pasta....try popcorn!,"My husband and I love to use these bowls for everything from popcorn to goldfish crackers, grapes, salad bowls, and fruit bowls for your apples and oranges that you set out on the kitchen table. Not only are these bowls practical but they add a touch of color to the countertops or the table....depends on where you feel like putting them! Enjoy! I know we do."
1,Not Dishwasher Safe,Don't buy this if you use a dishwasher! The color does not hold up---the lighter colors work well but not the plum.
2,Disappointed with Past Bowl,"I am happy with the delivery and the packaging. The bowl looks like it is chipped on the bottom base but upon closer examination has proven to be areas that the paint and glaze did not adhere. The bowl looks chipped though. There is an area on the side of the rounded part of the bowl that is scuffed, as if sand paper was rubbed against the bowl. I am unhappy with the condition but I only paid $11.00 for it. I like the color, even though it doesn't appear professionally painted and glazed. I would opt for something different next time.I would return it but the hassle is not worth my efforts. Also, this bowl was supposed to be a gift. I am now faced with the unfortunate dilema of either giving this bowl as a present or shopping for something else. I think 2 stars is a fair rating of this item."
4,Nice bowl,"When I first got this, it came broken in several pieces (though it was well-wrapped in plenty of bubble wrap) but Amazon gave me no trouble and replaced it with next day shipping (I had called them because the site wanted me to return the original, which was obviously pointless.) I got a replacement in great condition and it's a very nice bowl. It's pretty heavy - that may or may not be a good thing - I like it because between that and the relatively wide, flat base, I'm not worried about the cats knocking it over like they did to my last big bowl. I kind of thought this would be a little bigger/deeper than it is, and it wouldn't really make a good chip bowl like I hoped, but it would make a great serving bowl for other things."
4,Beautiful bowl,"As always, this Fiesta bowl doesn't disappoint. It's a lovely shade of red and arrived well packaged. I love how classic Fiesta ware is!"
4,gisselle en su mejor momento,"Este trabajo marca lo mejor de gisselle hasta el momento.Su evolucion y crecimiento artisticos se hacen evidentes en este album.El tema ""No tengo ley"" es mi favorito ella deberia grabar mas temas asi tipo discoteca el ritmo le va muy bien a su voz asi como su fuerte que es por supuesto el merengue.En cuanto a las baladas al ser baladas rockeras son mas diveritidas y se hacen mas creibles ya que su voz se muestra mas madura y potente en este album mis favoritas ""Alas del amor"" y""Hasta Rompernos"".""Duele en el Alma"" es hermosa y en cuanto a los merengues en este compacto se destacan ""De que nos vale"" y ""Aventurero"" definitivamente gisselle puede incorporar reggeatoneros a su propuesta sin que se le vea como algo impuesto si no natural a mi en lo personal siempre me ha gustado esta mezca de reggearengue desde sus inicios por ejemplo ""Franchezca"" y ""Lisa m"".En definitiva este album no debe faltar en tu coleccion."
4,Pretty nice,I recenly picked up pastel work again and needed something to help dust off the rust and this book was just it!
3,Disappointing,Too simplistic and did not have any real instruction. It was not the instructional book I was looking for.
5,Every Picture Tells a Story,"As with Alex Harvey's iconic stage presence, the album cover masterfully tells a tongue-in-cheek story that is then marvelously chronicled in the title cut.The second solo effort by Harvey (the first was during a brief break from SAHB, Alex Harvey Presents: The Loch Ness Monster) and the last album released before his untimely death in 1982, the eight tracks clock in at 42:23. The Whalers (Thar She Blows) and Oh Spartacus! are outstanding, but the pair of covers - Shakin' All Over, Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody - have Harvey delivering powerful statements, while adding his special touch to the arrangements.Harvey and Matthew Cang handle lead guitars, with Simon Chatterton (d), Tommy Eyre (k), Gordon Sellar (b) and Don Weller (sax), in what was setting the stage for the next phase of Harvey's musical career; it was going to be brilliant."
2,New Compact House Designs,"If you are wanting to build, this is more of a reference or idea book, I didn't find any real useful info. in this book and none of the designs were anything I was interested in. I thought this book would be more of a how to book and it definitely wasn't!!! Not a book I would recommmend to anyone, I will keep it in my library for a reference in case of future projects or a freinds project."
4,Freaky and unreal!,I would like to recommend this book highly. It is an excellent tale of an unreal life. I really enjoyed reading this novel about a boy who becomes aware of his body.
4,Barbarians not Barbie dolls,"This was an excellent buy. Really worth it. It was more indepth than I had expected, which was a bonus. It turns the traditional historical view on its head, and gets the audience thinking, which is a must in my book!Thoroughly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes learning about history without being force fed one-sided facts.Terry Jones' Barbarians"
1,Pure NONSENSE,"It's really unfortunate that this kind of product, full of misconceptions, distortions and plain lies is available to people who have a genuine interest in learning about the Romans and the peoples and tribes that were in contact with them. To watch this ""documentary"" was an exercise in frustration and impotence, seeing how this guy's ideas (a mix of fantasy, lies, and a pinch of truth) were presented as facts. I'm not an historian, but having read many well-known authors on these subjects (Goldsworthy, Freeman, Connolly, etc), one has to ask what are the real motives of this guy to present such a distorted view of history. Please, don't take this ""documentary"" as history, because it's not, and look elsewhere to learn from people who actually know something."
5,Very informative,"Terry Jones adds humor to history lessons. I learned a great deal from this DVD, so I plan on getting more of his documentaries. There is nothing boring and things move along. Very informative and interesting. I recommend this to history fans, and Terry Jones fans."
3,TD6 Works with Win 7 after a little tinkering,"Bought this in a fit of nostalgia. This game was a fave of mine mostly because of the soundtrack. The racing mechanics and graphics are acceptable, although not as detailed as newer games.Had a few minutes trouble getting it to work with the new PC, but after downloading some dll files (drmclien.dll and strmdll.dll both available on the web) and installing a media codec pack (Media Player Codec Pack available on CNET) everything worked perfectly.Running on Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit"
2,Not good,The cars are completely unrealistic. They don't handle like the cars they are. The environmental graphics are alright but the cars are just silly looking. If you want a realistic racing game check out NFS - Porsche Unleashed.
1,Opionated and non-Biblical Are the Words,"This book, recommended to me by a physician was bought and read. It ignores the Bible and would appeal to those who are having a hard time accepting the Bible as the Word of God. In my opinion it was wasted money on the purchase and even more tragic that I spent several hours of my life reading such trivia. The book did not remain in my library."
5,Facinating reading - Rabbi Jesus,"I must read for every Christian. I read this over and over again. I purchased several copies as gifts for friends and clients. After reading this my faith has increased and I have fewer doubts about the reality of Jesus, his time and his followers.Wonderful gift!"
2,"Son of ""Last Temptation""","At least Kazantzakis wasn't reckless enough to call his novel a work of ""scholarship."" Chilton, on the other hand, is the latest in a long line of ""scholars"" who purport to give us unlettered lay folk the unvarnished ""truth"" about who Jesus was: Schweitzer, Schonfield, Allegro (you remember him: the ""Jesus was a sacred mushroom"" guy)and a long list of now long forgotten Church history ""revisionists"" . Chilton in rare spots makes some good points, but for your money's worth, pick up E.P. Sanders or even Brad Young. If you _must_ read ""Rabbi Jesus,"" borrow it from the library."
5,READ THIS BOOK !!!!,"This book has changed the way I think about Jesus. I was a Christian before I read this book and a Christian, I remain. This book is a wonderful and demanding exploration into his ministry. Ye of little faith avoid this book at all costs! Those who love truly Jesus, might risk this venture and grow in your understanding of his most neglected aspect, Jesus the man."
4,A fascinating read.,Chilton makes numerous imaginative leaps. But the possibilities he proposes give rise to numerous ways of seeing Jesus differently than we have been taught. He teaches us much about the life and times surrounding Jesus. He may even tell us more than we would have known about Jesus.
1,"Hypothetical nonsense from an ""educated"" man.","A pretty bad story. Full of creative hypothesis, but not much else/ I would have rated it higher if Chilton had based his story on more credible information. Chilton apparantly had presuppositions about Jesus and used his considerable knowledge of Jewish culture to validate his opinion."
2,"Jesus, or Jim Morrison Does 1st Century Judea ?","First off this author takes great liberty surmising the ''hidden years'' of Jesus' life, although plausable in most instances. What comes out in the wash, is a lazy, self consumed, pot bellied, balding, alcoholic shaman, mooching off his rich friends, continually making a spectacle of himself. Minus the drugs, and mooching off friends, we have a 1st century Jim Morrison.There is ample proof that Jesus' family supported his ministry, however not the case in this author's opinion. And I find the author's interpretation of scripture, and or events do not always follow that of widely accepted scholarly opinion, such as the above mentioned family support. To each his own interpretation, freedom is given, but the picture of the Jesus this author represents, himself a priest, I am glad he does not represent me.""The Historical Jesus of the Gospels"" by Craig Keemer, is the book I recommend."
5,A Culturally Correct Jesus,"Bruce Chilton has offered a plausible analysis of the gospel events in their appropriate Jewish setting, answering age-old questions about the ""missing years"", and helping readers to understand what Jesus might have said, and might have meant by what he said, in the context of first-century Jewish culture and religion. The author uses his vast knowledge of Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke, and the Targums, the oral Hebrew Biblical tradition known to Jesus, as aids in his analysis. Woven throughout this narrative of Jesus' life are clues to what the parables meant to Jesus, what his deep spirituality and his relationship with God were like, and what he really meant when he said ""this wine is my blood and this bread is my flesh"". A must-read for thoughtful Christians!"
1,Disappointed,"I was eager to read this book. The author's credentials, an Episcopal priest, a spiritual shepherd, his notable accomplishments, having studied Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, Syriac, and Coptic languages, his scholarship, all promised to deepen the reader's understanding of Jesus the Messiah. I kept reading, waiting for this ""promise"" to unfold, but I was deeply disappointed in the author's depiction of Jesus as only a man, and a not very appealing one at that. By the end of the book, it seemed to have been written for other scholars, to display his remarkable talents and human wisdom, which he does appear to have, but as in 1 Corinthians 1:18-25, he has missed the mark. A book of fiction, a dead book."
1,Why did I bother?,"I bought the book, I read page after page thinking, ""Where is this guy getting this informaiton?"" ""What is he talking about?"" ""You've got to be kidding me."" ""I paid money for this?"" and finally, ""Im glad that's over."" Spend your money on JESUS UNDER FIRE or Van Voorst JESUS OUTSIDE THE NEW TESTAMENT. Maybe as I get older and wiser I'll regret feeling this way, but I do, becasue I read this book, it stunk, so that's my review.(Almost a year later, I went back to this book to give it a second chance; this book is nothing but wild induced self-absorbed intoxicant keystroke night shooting ""Yeesh~uah"" and bad at that to the point of ""throw out your bible"" and any other biblical historical reference and just go with it. 1/06 ADH.)"
1,Thoroughly Disappointed,"While the author quotes extensively from scripture to prove some points, he totally discounts other scripture (often in the same chapter and book). I was insulted, as a Christian, by the way he portrayed my Lord as a sniveling coward."
2,Losing the flavor of Christianity,"...my souring impression was that Chilton has lost the ingredients of traditional Christianity, in favor of a chique Jewish-flavored version. He reasons away difficult but essential Christian doctrines such as the virgin birth and the bodily resurrection of Jesus."
3,"Interesting, though not even close to Vermes in study","Bruce Chilton has added his voice to the neverending story. Weighing in on the Jewish side of Jesus, Chilton here presents Jesus as a troubled bastard son which weighs heavily on him and throughout the entire tome. Where Mr. Chilton is at his best is where he relies on his scholarship[placing Jesus birth in anothe bethlehem],presenting an interesting take on the infancy narratives. Where Geza Vermes relies on scholarship, Mr. Chilton edges at times toward flights of fancy,literally putting thougfhts in Jesus head{risky at best} entering the Kaballah into the fray{riskier],and putting unsubstantiated conjecture on the ""missing years' of Jesus life. Where Mr. Chilton does well, is in putting a new look on old {the last supper]. Where he does not, is in trying to explain what he cannot support. Interesting, a decent read,though Geza Vermes and John Meir cover the same grtound, and in far better books."
1,Author does not know,"It is very clear that the author does not know of whom he writes. Bruce Chilton has Jesus imbraceing Judaism before Judaism even existed. Althought it is true that Judaism came from the oral teachings of the Pharisees, Jesus condemed the teachings of the Pharisees. It is clear that the author does not know what he is talking about and is fabricating a story. Book should be listed as Fiction!"
1,Rabbi Jesus: An Intimate Biography,"Seeking deeper insight into each person in the Blessed Trinity, I picked up Rabbi Jesus, excited at the prospect of learning more about Jesus's contemporary life. How sad that the author could not leave open the possibility of Jesus's divinity. Instead on page 2 he states categorically that Christ was the product of an illicit love affair and goes on to develop a fictional account of His life loosely based on historical research. This book is a great disappointment. It masquerades as legitimate scholarship yet delivers a sordid, unsupported invention."
1,This should go in fiction section,"It would be helpful if the author based what he writes on some facts. For instance, he said that the years between Jesus's teenage to his mid twenties were spent with John the Baptist, yet he doesn't even attempt to show how he came up with this idea. He minimizes the reality of miracles and looks almost exclusively at the spiritual meaning. However, the gospels state that many were converted through his miracles. If one compares this with Vermes book, Borg's, Wright's, or (especially) Meier's books on the same subject, this book comes up short on credibility. Other authors at least give some arguement for their views."
1,Not Very Scholarly for a Self-proclaimed Scholarly Work,Very disappointing. Mostly the author's interpretation and speculation based on personal opinions and conclusions - Examples: Mary and Joseph obviously were quickly attracted to each other and began sleeping together. It was an obscure 'Bethlehem' in Galilee vice the Judean Bethlehem where Jesus was born. Glad that Chilton knows these things as fact.
3,"Tons of information, but not worth $110","This is the best reference I've found on small fruit crop production. The authors are both scientists, so it's not very entertaining, but it is very informative. You can, with some effort, find about everything you need to know to grow common small fruit crops. However, the index is no help at all. It's more of a reference book for farmers than for gardeners."
3,Book Lover From Tampa,"Russia A History, A great starter book for those who wish to learn what the Russian people have gone through in the quest for freedom. It clearly covers the high points of revolution and all the players involved. Lots of pictures that sharpen the view of the story."
2,"Great teacher, not so great book","I'm taking a class from the author this semester - thus my anonymity (hey, I still want a chance at a 4.0!). Mike Ekedahl is a very knowledgable resource and an excellent teacher. You wouldn't know it from reading this book though. The book is incredibly hard to understand. It's one of those books where you can read the same sentence 10 times and still not have a clue what you just read. Instead of breaking the new terminology into easier-to-understand material, the chapters use previously undefined terminology to define the new terminology making for a very difficult read. I found the MSDN library to be far more help than this book."
1,Who pays this man to write books,"Ekedahls books are not good books to learn programming. They are books that teach how to type code in the code windows and run and ""Look how well I can tell you to write a program"". Unfortunately you do not learn how to prorgam. You are lost and confused and looking at your classmate asking if they understand the class.For a beginner's book get Diane Zak's, It will save u time and money, stress, anger and hatred towards him."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on.,"I have to say I agree with the reviews below that state that this book is not for beginners. Others have already pointed out the problems with this book, and I agree with them.Don't buy it, unless you are looking for an expensive paper weight."
4,Great source of Learning VB.NET and ASP.NET for all,"I have been a Visual Basic 6 developer for 2 years and wanted to make a transition to VB.NET and to learn more on ASP.NET web applications programming. I decided to try this books and found it very helpful, it is very precise in regards to the topic under discussion and the tutorials accompanied with the Chapters are very good as well. The reader gets a complete picture of the topic and only after completing the topics in the book can manage to write it's own source code without any need from any other source. The Comprehensive edition of the book is more indepth for the ASP.NET and database programming concepts using ADO.NET. Definately a good book for beginners and middle level programmers."
2,"Disjointed, but maybe helpful","I felt the Author spent too many pages on telling stories of things he had heard that others had done in this business. Very few things seem to be from the personal experience of the author. I came to the conclusion by the time I had gotten bored with the book that the author wrote it to ""build wealth with royalties"" instead of rental properties. It has a few good ideas and points but seriously lacked any connection with the next topic or idea."
4,OLDIE BUT GOODIE,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR THE DO-IT-YOURSELFER. IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR MANY,MANY YEARS. HE HAS STRONG RECOMENDATIONS ON YOU TAKING CHARGE. HE BELEAVES IN RENTING GOOD CLEAN UNITS AND GIVING GOOD SERVICE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY OVERLOOK. TALKS ALOT ABOUT DEALING WITH TENANTS. HE TELLS OF A LOT OF LITTLE TIDBITS IN MANAGEING HIS PROPERTY. EXPLAINS IN LENGTH CONTRACT FOR DEEDS. HE TAKES YOU THRU THE BEGINING OF INVESTING TO CASHING OUT. COMPARES RENTALS TO 401K's AND MANAGEING YOUR MONEY. HE IS THE FIRST AUTHOR TO TALK ABOUT YOUR WELL BEING AS A LANDLORD AND GIVES ALOT OF ADVICE TO HELP COPE IN THE BAD TIMES AND TELLS OF KEEPING A GOOD MENTAL ATTITUDE. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE EARLY 90's THIS BY FAR IS ONE OF THE BETTER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ."
3,Address the investor's pysche as well as the market itself.,"This is a starter book for first-time investors. (...) I think the book deserves aread through, especially for first time investors who are hesistant to take a risk on real estate. He addresses the mindset behind investing, and why everyone should be involved, not just ""geniuses and rich people"".He spends a fair amount of time encouraging and explaining real estate investing to would be investors. So give at a try. This might be a good book to pick up used, along with a few others."
1,Little Substance,"This book is for those individuals who are flirting with the idea of buying rentals. The first 100 pages were purely motivational: Stories of people who have done well with rentals and the repetetive ""I've done it, and you can do it too!"" mantra that you get in cheap infomercials. The rest of the book provides little useful information about buying and managing rental units. I read the entire book in an afternoon. It amazed me how little information could be packed into 306 pages (though large print and many pictures of properties did help).Don't regard this review as mean spirited: there are many very good books on investing in residential real estate, but this one is not worth the money."
5,Excellent eye-opener on the current status of India,A must for anyone concerned with the people of India. This book is written in simple language and is precise. I know people whose whole attitude toward our Indian problem have changed after reading this book. This book clearly shows how even the middle-class Indians have been responsible (indirectly) for the degeneration of India.
3,Eh...,"""Pug Hill"" starts off fairly strong for a chick lit novel, but then falls apart at the end. At first, the character of Hope McNeill seems to have more depth than the typical chick lit protagonist, and I found myself laughing at a lot of her situations and relating to many of her observations. I also enjoyed the way dogs were a focal point of the story, and thought the author did a great job of capturing the important roles animal companions tend to play in people's lives. Unfortunately, though, the plot of this book really goes nowhere, and Hope ends up with another stereotypical chick lit ending, which is unexpected and rather disappointing. Such a shame, because the first half of the book has a lot of potential."
1,90% NOT ABOUT PUGS!!!,"I am a huge pug lover, so naturally this book seemed like a good read. WRONG!!! To get straight to the point--It seems that the author used the title and cover to mislead people into believing that the story revolves around pugs. It does NOT. This is a story about a woman and certain aspects of her life with pugs just thrown in there.As I was reading, I got into the woman's story, but then out of nowhere, pugs are mentioned and it threw me completely off balance. I even said out loud, ""What the heck do pugs have to do with that?"" As I said, it seems like the author wrote a story, but to sell it, she added pug things every now and then."
4,"A good, entertaining read!!","This was the first Alison Pace book I've read, and I was pleasantly surprised. I am a die-hard Pug lover, and have 2 of my own. So I know a lot about Pugs and their peculiar behaviors, and it seemed at times that she was a bit off-base about the typical Pug traits, but she does capture their very essence. Her style of writing is easy to get involved in and it flows well. I enjoyed the in-depth characters in this book, and I think that most of us will imagine people we've known in our lives that fit her character's personalities to a tee. There were many times that I really wanted the main character, Hope, to be a bit stronger. But overall, it was a fast, entertaining and relatable read."
2,"2.5 out of 5 rating--review from So Many Books, So Little Time","Yes, I have to admit that the puppies on the cover drew me in. I love dogs so I couldn't wait to read this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.Often times, I'll feel sympathetic for a character which usually makes me like them more. But in this story, I just felt that Hope was pitiful. I never really liked her. It might sound mean, but I found myself thinking that she was pathetic. And that doesn't really make me want to root for her.The very end was nice and happy and you can imagine a happily-ever-after situation in the future. So there's always that I suppose."
4,Wonderful! An enjoyable read!! Not just for crazy pug people!,"This was a very entertaining book that touched home alot for me. I could relate to Hope on so many levels: as a second-best sibling, a thirty yeard old (thirty-one by her mom's math!) woman, a terrified public speaker, and a lover of pugs! It was also eerily similar how she wondered how you find a guy like her dad, one that is willing to do so much for his dogs...and about the pug in the end. I'm constantly amazed that not only did I find a guy that doesn't mind if I dress up my pugs, he will actually carry one in a pouch on his chest! I love this book!"
5,beautiful,I love the elegant look of this faucet but I also like that the spout is pull out and you can change how the water flows.
1,Leaping and Bounding to Unsubstantiated Conclusions,"Boykin's blog is filled with misinformation, i.e., at one point he stated West Hollywood is the product of White Gay gentrification, forcing people of color out of the neighborhood with high rents and property values. This was a statement made by a man who lived in Los Angeles for two years!Boykin's personal agenda, largely based on having an axe to grind with anyone not sharing in his black gay narrow-mindedness, gets in the way of any cohesive or reasonable argument to be made with the book.So reading this book came with no surprise that it is filled with stories from personal history as the ONLY means to back-up his claims.Boykin rambles, repeats himself, and says nothing insightful or of value.Pass on this book - it is a copy of a diary, posing as a ""research effort""."
2,Take it or leave it,"I've just finished reading Boykin's book, ""Beyond the Down Low."" While I find it well written and his observations often on point, I come away from reading the final paragraph thinking, ""So what?""Really, Boykin has unearthed nothing ""new"" about sexuality or sexual identity as it has been played out since there have been men, women and the undecided.Boykin's book gains much of its cachet because it is one of the few published books that addresses sexuality from the perspective of a gay black man. The very paucity of literature that focuses on the plight of gay black men in America alone makes Boykin's contribution invaluable, regardless of the quality of his prose. Ultimately, however, his work is forgettable."
2,Dated but Historical,"Published in 1976, this book by Dr. Mortimer Lacher, MD would not be very useful for a person who has just been diagnosed. But for the lymphoma historian this book is a good read. Dr. Lacher's later book Hodgkin's Disease: The Consequences of Survival is more sought after but alas out of print. Recommended for the student of medicine or medical information or for patents treated in this era. If you need current information, you should search for more recent books or web sites."
1,siempre el mismo setlist,No puede ser que Korn tenga tantos discos...tantas canciones espectaculares y siempre toquen lo mismo...no puede ser que de un disco tan impresionante como Korn III NO TOQUEN NADA!!!....ya me resultan aburridos sus discos en vivo y sus conciertos...por eso este nuevo blu ray para mi es basura
1,This is horrible and misleading!,I thought this CD had some music on it. It is nothing but Kanye West talking with some crappy background music that is the same on each track. DO NOT BUY THIS!
2,Where's the cheese?,"As far as a pretzel goes, these have the great taste of snyders pretzels, but as far as ""cheddar cheese"" goes there is so little in the sandwich, cant even notice it. The picture on the front of the bag looks like there is a lot of cheese, but the actual pretzels have a minute amount of filling."
5,Taste bud satisfier!!,"These snacks are totally tasty and satifying! I take them to my beach volleyball tournaments and EVERYONE wants them. I've started giving them to my friends as birthday gifts....they love them so much. I have serious trouble finding these in my local stores, so I turned to Amazon to find them and VOILA!! I bought a case of them to last me a while! The pumpernickel is a great pretzel flavor and the jalepeno cheddar adds a nice light spicy touch. I eat them like Oreos; I split it open and lick the cheddar in the middle, then eat the pretzel ends!! :) Kinda fun to eat! Trust me when I say they are delicious. Oh....and don't just buy one bag, you will definitely want more!!! Enjoy!!"
4,Would Recommend,"It took me awhile to put on, since I had to drill holes in it. Also, the 3m tape comes off but, you can replace it. I would of gave it 5 stars if it wasnt for the above. But looks great after i made some small adjustments. Would recommend."
1,Useless if you want to learn about wine.,"This video is useful if all you are interested in is learning how to uncork wine and decant it. I wanted to learn about red wine vs. white wine, the different kinds of red and white wine, vintages, etc. NONE of this is on this tape. Hugh seriously spends 10 minutes (out of 53) on corkscrews and their history. Matt Kramer's books are much better for high level wine learning - Wine for Dummies is probably adequate for beginner-level stuff."
2,I have every single veggietales movie... and this one is their most disappointing.,"Veggietales has always had the ability to make me awe at how clever they are, and how witty they can be... while still conveying a biblical message. This unfortunately the worst attempt they have ever made in my opinion. If you don't own any veggietales movies... don't start here. You'll get the wrong impression. Start with A Snoodles Tale, The Big River Rescue, The Easter Carroll, or the Sumo of the Opera. It just is bland. The message fails to come across... and the silly song is weak.It seems as if the writing was either rushed or done by somebody else.I would only recommend this one if you are like my family and own every single one of their movies and basically want to continue collecting all their films."
4,Love Veggie Tales,I love Veggie Tales. I love what Veggie Tales have in them but more importantly what's not in them. I can let my daughter watch a Veggie Tales video and not worry that the content is going to be inappropriate or even borderline inappropriate.
5,Back to the good stories!,Great return to the good ole Veggie Tales that pulled our family into these wonderful tales. I laughed hard the first time through watching this with my son.
4,Merry Christmas to Me...,"Firstly, my thanks to Amazon with their amazingly efficient shipping service. I was pleasantly surprised to actually have received this before promised, right in the thick of the holiday season. I have this sucker running around the track as I write this. It is so much better constructed and more detailed than the generic Bachmann train cars. It has some decent weight which ultimately assist with traction as well. My only complaint is now it makes the rest of my train look shabby. Such are the tribulations of living in a relative world."
3,It Works Good To Relieve Cold Symptoms But The Taste Is Icky!,I have had to use Nyquil when I had really bad colds and the stuff really does work and gives you temporary relief so you can get some sleep at night but unfortunately the taste is really awful and mediciney and the so called cherry flavor really does not mask that flavor and I found that I had to mix this stuff with cola or juice and even then the mediciney taste over powered the juice and cola and I had a hard time getting this stuff down without gagging on the horrible taste so next time I ever get a bad cold I'm going to try the Nyquil liquicaps and since I can swallow those with a glass of water I should have no problems with them and at least I won't be sickened by a horrible icky taste!
4,Is it good for English speakers?,"I spent a lot of time in the bookstore looking at this dictionary. It seems that there are few Chinese dictionaries on the shelves these days.Good:1. there are both traditional and simplified characters2. print is nice and rather clear3. you can look up words by radicals as well as Pin Yin pronunciation (and I've read by stroke count too).HOWEVER, it seems to be geared more to the Chinese person leaning English. For example, when you look up ""Chinese"", there is zhongwen, zhongguo, etc., but it doesn't tell you how to use the different words. You would then probably have to look up these words on the Chinese side for more information."
5,What a relief,This is the best Chinese-English/English-Chinese dictionary there is. The earlier edition of this book was simply too small. I suffered thru the early small size book using a magnifying glass for details of the written characters for 4 years before this one became available. No more magnifying glass!
3,Not great but not bad,"It seems so difficult to find a decent two-way Chinese-English dictionary. I can understand why so many people prefer this dictionary; it is better than almost all others. Even so, I often find it frustrating to use. Even if I find the word, there is not always a clear definition, explanation, or example. But as I said, it's better than most. I find the Oxford Starter Chinese Dictionary better for a beginner, and it is the dictionary I use most often for my homework. Ultimately, it is the book one uses most often that is the best, isn't it?"
3,"Useful, I dont like it very much, but let's live with it","I dont like the following points: 1.- printing too small 2.- sentences used as example have no pronounciation Good points: 1.- Indicates traditional charactersHowever there is no much other options, just live with it."
5,"Very, very good...","This dictionary is absolutely great. I have owned a number of copies over the years, and it is just the only dictionary to have when you are on the road in China.I have inspected many, many Chinese dictionaries over the years in the never ending quest for better Mandarin resources, and I have always been disappointed with other dictionaries of a similar (and sometimes much larger!) size - they always have too few entries or too few examples to be of practical use.I notice that one or two reviewers have commented on the size of the dictionary, so if you are looking for a huge, weighty tome to sit on your desk (and not take with you anywhere), then this may not be the dictionary for you. But if you are looking for a fabulous little dictionary with tens of thousands (including jiantizi and fantizi) of entries that will not let you down either during study or in the wilds of China then this is definitely the one for you."
3,Not the best but not that bad,"Personally I did not like this dictionary because it relies too much on pinyin and not enough on the actual characters. But I did like the fact that it did have a radical reference, since this is a really valuable resource. But the radical index needed to be bigger. As mentioned in other reviews there are mistakes and some of them are major mistakes. It could have been a lot better and if you are a serious chinese student you should probably ask a chinese professor to recommend a good dictionary, it will probably be more expensive than this one. On a side note, the characters in this book are the standard characters of the PRRC and it uses the Mandarin dialect, that means that it uses simplified characters. Those are the standard if you don't want the simplified characters it is probably a better idea to get a Tiwanese dictionary or a Cantonese dictionary, and not complain about this dictionary."
1,Save your money,"I took this dictionary to China to study Chinese intensively at what could be best described at a ""high-beginner"" level, and quickly found it was inadequate to the task. So many common words are omitted entirely that I was soon required to purchase an additional dictionary in China. My Concise dictionary? I left it behind to serve as a doorstop in Beijing."
3,Better dictionaries are out there...,It is better to invest in another one. This one really isnt amazing.
5,A treasured set!,"This admirable CD contains certainly several priceless musical reference documents.Once of them is the last appearance with The Berlin Philharmonic., on September 12, 1954 with Beethoven's First Symphony Op 21' s performance.Robust, of virile expression, despite of the dynamic of its tempo is a mite slow, but is fairly compensated by a majestic approach, filled of radiant splendor.The Fourth symphony is fabulous. Involved in that aura of gorgeous exultation filled of these enigmatic silences that work out as living pulse beatings. Recorded in 1953. with VPO:The Egmont is dramatic, fierce and intense. Recorded in 194 with VPO:"
3,What You Will Do For a Hot Woman,"Diana White's brother Paul inherited a fortune from their aunt. He sees no point in getting a job, why should he? Living a playboy type existence he disappears on a remote Scottish Island and his yacht is found drifting in the ocean. Diana does not believe the official finding that Paul fell overboard so convinces a reluctant Bruce Standon to find out what really happened.James Pattinson books vary drastically in quality and this although not his best isn't his worst effort either. Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels. High quality Pattinson novels worth your time and money are Skeleton Island, The Time of Your Life, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang, Blind Date, The Golden Reef, Stride and Life Preserver."
1,Completely worthless,"This is a very poorly constructed product. The thin stips of velcro are not sewn on well. The stitching on mine came apart the first time I used it. I now just use the mini Ipod belt clip on a water bottle carrying belt when I run and it works perfectly. If you really want an armband, I would buy the Ipod brand over this one despite it's ridiculous price."
3,it has it's flaws,"i purchased this for my wife's mini. she was very exited to get it, then had trouble tightening it around her arm. she is petite, 5'3"" and around 115 lbs. we finally got it to tighten around her arm but trying different ways of securing the band through the actual holder. now it works ok. find something else."
4,Great for the gym,Very neat and compact.... The thing is that prepare for the plastic to tear! I have to think about getting a new one after almost a year. It was fun while it lasted!
3,"Plastic clip broke first day, but I'm still using the rest of it","I read the reviews about this being a poorly constructed product, but I couldn't resist the price. The plastic clip broke the first time I used it, but so far, the rest of it (arm band, lanyard, and ""rubber sleeve"") is working well."
5,Great product at a great price,"This product works as advertised. Once I figured out how to unscrew the belt clip knob so it wasn't jabbing me in the arm, it was great! I have small arms, it is tight enough."
4,Great For Runners,"I wear this on my upper arm while running and it stays in place.My only complaint: The rubber case fits so tightly that it's hard to take off. But, since every port on the i-pod is accessible through the case, I just leave the case on."
1,Waiting for this great item,I am wondering why I am still waiting to recieve this item I ordered in December? It is still available for sale and delivery in 6 weeks and I still dont have mine???
2,only one left in print,"It's a shame that other BETTER interstate travel guides are out-of-print and thus not 'updated', such as the original ""The Next Exit Guide: North Atlantic Region.""The Next Exit Guide: North Atlantic Regionwas much more advanced-ahead of its time, organized by interstate rather than by state, had boat loads more information (contact, phone #, points of interest, etc). Even with some non-updated information, I find it still is better. And then I use this book as a backup for changes."
2,Could be better,"If the ""Interstate Exit Authority"" was currently available, I would difinately NOT recommend ""the Next Exit"". Exit Authority was head and shoulders above Next Exit. BUT since this seems to be all that is available, I have no choice. several years ago I purchased the Next Exit, and the next year purchased Intereste Exit Authority. I have just received the 2004 Next exit and find I am still disapointed, but it is better than nothing."
1,Not very motivating,"While this is definitely a cheaper alternative than Rosetta Stone, the software isn't engaging or motivating enough to get me to learn anything other than basic phrases. I am a pretty quick learner and I found the structure of the program very confusing. I wasn't sure what to click on, there wasn't a defined learning path that made any sense, and I just eventually gave up. The one feature I did enjoy were the flashcards. I ended up printing these vocabulary lists and trying to memorize key words on the flight to Rome in order to impress my in-laws. I don't know how much better Rosetta Stone would have been, but if you are like me and not willing to spend that kind of money, I'd suggest doing further research before buying this product."
4,A Donald Westlake book?,"Yup, or so many of the fan sites would have us believe. Written when he was cranking out mysteries under pen names, it may not be Westlake at chipper best, but each is a well-written, well-crafted mystery starring ""Samuel Holt,"" a cop turned star of a cancelled televison series, who now has the time to solve cases for real."
2,Alan Bown More Cheeky Pop Whimsey Than Solid Psych,"Unfortunately this is another CD that I have purchased recently on my quest to find all of the great 60s psych, no matter how obscure. In my travels I have discovered allot of gems in the rough, but sorry folks, this ain't one of them. Although the CD contains some tight instrument arrangements, the songs are pathetically simple and painfully cheeky. A good way to discribe this CD would be if Syd Barrett released an album when he was 6 years old. There is 1 great song on this CD though called ""My Girl The Month Of May"" which stands way above the remaining dribble. Thus, the 2 stars instead of 1."
5,Jack the rabbit and the perfect Christmas present,"Jack the rabbit is in search of the perfect Christmas for his sweetheart Ginger. He finds an adorable little kangaroo with soft fur at the local toy shop and buys it for Ginger, but before he can take it home, it hops out the door! Thus begins an adventure of sorts...poor Jack trips, falls, and gets into all sorts of mishaps in his efforts to retrieve the kangaroo. Will he ever find it, and what is he to tell Ginger?The story is engaging, especially due to the lovely color illustrations and fold out pages that open to reveal all the vibrant scenes of animals enjoying the winter and holiday season. The story ends on a positive note, and will have young and older readers smiling at the beauty of it all."
5,A sweet book,The Perfect Present is a very sweet Christmas story with wonderful pictures. Kind of Beatrice Potter looking. And many of the pages open up to one really big page. It's just a wonderful book to read to young children.
3,some missing information,"You could call this a ""drive-by review"". I came across this series of ""movie classics"" calendars while poking around... looking for a calendar for next year. These sets look like they might make nice gifts for movie buffs as well, *but* at the present time Amazon does not tell us what the contents of the disks are; an important omission!In case you are curious, as I was. this set (Musicals Film Classics 2010) includes the following (information retrieved from another web site):Till the Clouds Roll ByCalendar GirlStage Door CanteenCareer GirlRoyal WeddingThe Duke is TopsSunny, Breakfast in HollywoodSecond ChorusMr. ImperiumThe Fabulous DorseysHi-De-HoHopefully this information will help others who might be interested in this, but don't know whether or not they already own copies of the films.I'll note, that I found the contents with help from a comment left by another customer on a review of a different set in this series. Thanks!"
1,Unacceptable as embroidery needles,"The ""embroidery needles"" are not at all appropriate for embroidery! The needles are too short and the eye of the needles is not long enough. Maybe they can be used for something else, but not for embroidery with three strands of floss."
1,The pocketbook edition of Last's - don't buy it!,"What has Chummy done?The bible for anatomists - Last's - has suffered it's worse insult yet, following the editing done by the new author. What was once comprehensive, is now much shorter, lacking in detail, and inconsistant. Where does the right phrenic pierce the diaphragm? With or next to the IVC? Through the IVC foramen or piercing the tendon? Both appear in the text... muscles have gained new origins, and interosseus planes cease to exist!Whilst maintaining an economical writing style, the only saviour to the text is the superb diagrams and pictures carried over from previous editions - each really does tell a story of a thousand words, which is useful, because the text doesn't.If you can, find a copy of the ninth edition - the best yet!"
1,This game is bleh,"I bought this game thinking it would be just like the first one only better. It wasnt any better, infact its worse. The first outpost was kinda like a Sim City in outer space where you evolve and build your town. This outpost2 was difficult to figure out, it laged really bad later in the game, there was nothing special about it as far as being a sequal, and it was down right boring.Save yourself a few bucks and skip this one."
4,A pleasing hermeneutical exegesis on the Zhongyong,"Tu Wei-ming's brilliant essay on the sociopolitical, religious and personal dimensions of the Chinese Confucian classic ""Doctrine of the Mean"" is not only the perfect companion for the original text, but stands alone as a useful analytical text. Tu's treatment of the profound person, fiduciary community and the moral metaphysics as propounded by the esoteric text attributed to Confucius' grandson are enlightening. His final analysis of Confucianism as a religious system is eye-opening and convincing, and rings with his personal beliefs. Not perhaps the most easy text to follow for the uninitiated novice, but highly informative to those who would seek to understand this ancient system through a different lense."
2,Ceased links,Not what I expected from Shimano. Links are locked up causing the chain to hop in and out of gear. Had to take off an put my old chain back on.
1,An absolute piece of junk. Don't WASTE your money!!!!,"This has got to be the worst chain I have ever purchased. Wal-mart sells more durable chains than this. Shimano should be ashamed of themsleves. I'd never put this on any bike, even if it was gifted to me.First time, it worked for about 25 miles and broke. Second time, worked for about 50 miles and then broke. I decided not to put it back on my bike. Grabbed an ""emergency"" chain off an old wal-mart bike and have been riding without any problems since. Considering the bike came out of the trash.... well, you get my point.Don't think that your going to get away with a good HG53 chain. This chain is nothing but junk. Don't waste your time or money on this. Steer away. Don't make me tell you that ""I told you so"". If you want a entry level chain, go to wal-mart and buy the ""bell"" brand for around $8, it will last much longer!!!If you want quality then you must go ultegra, dura ace, xtr, or Sram."
5,A great read!,"I loved this book. I have been a fan of Mr. Parker since he starred in ""Simon and Simon"" in the 80s, and always wondered what had become of him. In ""An Accidental Cowboy"" I found out.I commend him for writing about things that he probably would have rather forgotten -- his depression, his suicidal thoughts, etc. It is very hard to explain things you do not know yourself. And to open yourself up to total strangers, even when you don't have to look those people in the face, is especially difficult. Thank you for being so honest.The stories about ranch life were very entertaining. Even people who have never been on a ranch before should find them fascinating. I grew up on a farm in Oklahoma, where we had cattle and horses, and I was caught up in the day-to-day life of the California cowboys. I will never forget this book, and I hope anyone else who reads it enjoys it as much as (most of) the reviewers here did."
2,"Depressing, Rambling Mess That's for Cowboy-lovers Only","This book has nothing to do with Jameson Parker's acting career--it is a rambling mess that is 90% about him taking care of horses and cattle, with the other 10% being interspersed comments on his depression. There is nothing linear, so things are all mixed up and dates are not given. You don't get to him being shot until page 175, which actually happened years before he became a cowboy. He refers to his depression and being suicidal earlier in the book but it makes no sense in context because he hasn't explained why. It is a big disappointment if you are looking for something about his career. Why couldn't he say something about the projects he has been involved in or told more about being married to the famous Darleen Carr? Instead, if you want to read boring, detailed stories about the cowboy life then you might enjoy it."
5,Someone who observed Ayn Rand first-hand.,"This is a well-written defense of Ayn Rand against her critics by someone who knew Rand in person. I wish this book was much longer and loaded with more of her observations of Rand and Branden. I'd love to sit with her and ask her many questions about her experience in the circles of those who attended lectures on Ayn Rand's philosophy in the early days.A book that considers much more evidence and does an in-depth analysis of the statements of the Brandens and provides an irrefutable defense of Ayn Rand's moral character, self-awareness and clarity of thought is James Valliant in The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics. It was a book I expected to hate, but its evidence and reasoning persuaded me."
5,Wonderful,Perfect for taco night!! I saw this in a store a year ago and didn't get it. I'm so glad that I found it on Amazon. Thanks!!
2,Not a well built product,"Bought this for a youngster who suffers allergy indoors. It's a fairly simple product, a foam film, 2 pseudoHEPA filters, and 2 intake fans. Low and medium setting barely does anything, doesn't move much air. High setting is loud. Even though the front exhaust seem big, air only comes out of half of it, fan must not built correctly. It DOES NOT SWIVEL/OSCILLATE. The ionizer does not seem to make much difference. Not a great product for people who needs serious allergy relief."
1,Broken and stuck with a dozen filters,Well they win. I bought this junk and 2 years later it rotates and the blower motor failed. Now I have 12 filters sitting in my closet and no air purifier so I am forced to buy another one. Wow what a racket.
1,Horrible! Broke after ONE WEEK!,"I bought this just one week ago. It barely worked in the first place, my room is an EXTRMELY tiny room, so I figured that a unit this size would work very well. Wrong. I have a pet mouse in here, and it still smelled even with the unit running 24/7. My allergies weren't any better after using this unit either. Then, after just one week of working (or lack there of), the motor went out! It quit blowing air, and then all it did was sit there and make a loud humming sound. I called where I got it from and they said I could send it back. I'll send it back alright, and but I will NOT be getting another one. I'll go with another brand."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This filter claims to be one of the best as far as cleaning out the dust, pet dander, allergens, pollen and simply cleaning the air. It does do all of that, however, the replacement filters are $25.00 a pair and they need to be replaced quite frequently depending on how dirty your room is. I should have spent the $400 plus dollars on a Sharper Image machine instead."
5,Right up there with The Joy of Cooking!,"I originally bought this book for a couple of MY Friends due to our Thursday night ritual of watching the show, etc....But this cook book has turned out to have great recipies as well!I have loved EVERY recipe I have tried...pretty fail safe!They are staples of my weekly meal preparation for my family now!Nora's Kung Pao Chicken - easy and yummy (better than take out!)Phoebe's Fabulous Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies (they really aren't fair to other cookies! - if you remember that episode!)Iced Mocha Latte (who needs Starbucks!)Adult Only Macoroni & Cheese (only if you don't want to share with your kids!)Hope this helps get you interested....the recipes are really great and easy to follow too!I have bought the book for many of my Friends now & now after reading more reviews want to try some more recipes!"
5,Friends cook up a great book!,"This cookbook is awesome! It's a must-have for Friends afficionados. It has everything from Monica's sophisticated tastes to Joey's simple, delicious dishes. Plus, it is filled with quotes, pictures, and clever definitions and discussion pages. The recipies are great and the presentation of the book is just plain fun. Whether you are accustomed to cooking lox, linguini and lobster or not, this book has something for everyone."
5,"A must for all ""Friends""- lovers!!!","This (cook)book contains great recipes and then combines them with funny and memorable nostalgic trips for all ""Friends""- friends with it's way of connecting the recipe with something that has happened on the show. It also provides you with a set of nice photos and comments together with personal files about the actors of this great TV-series. It is a must for all ""Friends""- lovers! It provides you with stimulation for all your senses, and is exceptional because it's not just a cookbook, it's a mixture of almost everything you would want, and also expect from this show. The ""10"" is for it's unique appearance, but also because there isn't anything of the kind to use as a comparison.."
4,I loved it!,I loved the cookbook! It has some really good recipes and I love the quotes from the show. It makes me laugh while cooking!
3,Good Condition,This book came to me a little banged up. The bottom of it was crunched up and every page was effected. Nothing was ripped though and it may have just been the packaging and handling of it. It came really quick.
2,okay cook book...,"I heard about this book on the radio and thought Id check it out, it was just okay. Honestly I dont think Ive looked at it since I bought it over a year ago. Never made any of the recipes in it."
2,too chewy for my liking,these ripped the braces right from my face. ouch. thank you for attention to this matter.
2,Old Type Touch Tone Wall Phone,"The phone is a good phone when you can us it but since we have not been able to use it, it is useless. On top of everything there was no booklet in box nor any paperwork sent with the phone like the desk phone that I received earlier. You cannot make contact with the jack that is in the wall. The part of the phone that connects to the wall needs to be a little bit longer and I am still trying to fix it. I bought this phone for my mother since she is hard of hearing. For $40.00 there should be some way for this phone to work."
1,PHONE DOES NOT RING!!!,Phone has never been able to ring ... a phone is supposed to ring when someone calls your number ... this phone has very few times where it actually rings ... mostly it just has no sound!!!
1,Deceptive advertisement.,"Watch out!!!! The phone is chocolate brown, not ivory. Seems a little deceptive in their advertisement."
1,Misleading advertising,Dont let the pictures fool you.....isn't that color and the real color is buried in the text. Finally allowed to return it. By the way it is a dirt brown color.
4,Great Great Great all around!,I have medium thick damaged hair w/ natural waves. I had this old conair curling iron/flat iron combo that made me burn myself everytime I tried to iron the roots. Finally it broke and I decided to try this one. I thought it was broken but then I realized you are supposed to hold the power button down for like 2 seconds before it turned on.Pros:1. heats up fast (dry mode level 10 heated up in less than a min.)2. can use on wet hair w/o damaging it.3. color coded and digital4. curved plates gives it a fuller look but it does miss the roots a bit because of its thickness.5. I can iron all my hair in less than 10 min.cons:the actual plates are shorter than my old conair one which in turn holds less hair.overall I love it.
3,Defective but works for me.,"My lap desk has a significant horizontal crack running from left to right along a join where the boards were not glued together or clamped adequately. I bought the desk for use with my laptop, so it isn't much of an issue for me. But the truth is, for an ""executive"" product the quality should have been better. If I actually used the desk for writing I would have sent it back.If it were woodworking that I had done for sale, I would be embarrassed. Still, for my purpose it has been fine."
3,So So,"If you are a fan of the Old Fashioned WInnie the Pooh illustrations, this is a cute book. It's a very simple alphabet book with a picture and word on each page."
5,really cute,Really cute diaper cake that fit the princess theme of the baby shower. Love the surprises on the inside of the cake.
5,Setting Limits,I purchased this book new. It is an excellent book for anyone working or living with children and adolescents. It reminds parents of the essential life skills necessary to raise competent children. I use this book in my mental health practice. Great selection.
4,Practical and sound advice,"My daughter's preschool made this book required reading for the first parents' meeting. I liked it. It's quick and easy to read (something to consider if you have to address some discipline problems immediately!) MacKenzie clearly states his points, contrasts his recommendations with other methods that do not seem to be effective, and gives lots and lots of examples. These examples stuck in my head, and I was able to implement some of his suggestions immediately with my 4-year-old daughter.Yet, as I read the book, I kept thinking, ""He makes it sound so simple!"" Any parent will tell you that disciplining children is not simple. And his methods don't always work. But I think this is a good starting place."
4,Such a help!,My husband and I found this book so helpful. Our three year old has not been a big problem but some difficulties arose after the birth of our second child. This has helped us be both disciplined and loving with both children.We are trying to figure out a polite way to suggest that some of our friends read it as well.
2,"Haven't gotten to the ""good parts"" yet...","I bought this book for the same reasons everyone else has, I have a challenging child, plus the fact that it got such good reviews. I'm having a hard time getting through it, though. Just when I find an example that I can relate to, and can't wait to read the part where I learn what I should do next, the author abruptly stops BEFORE telling you how to react to the situation and moves on to a totally different case!! What's THAT all about???!!! What do I do?? What did you tell your client to do??? How did it work?? I have so many questions that still have not been answered. It's extremely frustrating. Honestly, I don't want to pick up the book anymore. How far do you have to read to get the answers? If I find them, I'll write more...."
4,Better description,"I am well pleased with these shocks, they are the same you would buy through your local parts store. Even though no where in the ad it states what you get for sure... mine came two in a box and included a line set, everything you need. I would recommend these to anyone."
5,Alton Brown rocks!!!,"Based on what I could see on a recent FoodTV episode of Good Eats, I bought the waffle iron that Alton was using. He DOES know what he's doing. This is a great waffler."
2,Great Iron but questionable quality,"I bought this specific waffle iron for the brand and waffle shape. We all love waffles and the heart shape is fun for the kids. After about 5 months, the iron started overheating and burning our waffles. I started with a normal setting of 4, then moved to 2, now I'm at the 1 setting and my waffles are still burning. Unfortunately, I'm not happy with the quality, price and short life of this iron, but it was fun while it lasted."
4,Must Read,"The author seems has done his homework in a very difficult area. After reading the book, I feel that I begin to understand some of the details of this area. One negative comment -- Since OTO likes to reconcile opposites (liberal-conservative, male-female and so forth), understanding that the OTO is on both sides of the liberal-conservative divide, for example, doesn't imply that neither is the right choice for us as individuals. It is just that the enemy, as in tai-chi, will attempt go with his opponent for awhile, in order to deflect-divert him later. The author seems to believe that anywhere you see this kind of ocultic activity is a place that you should avoid and this may not be true. Still, this is only a minor criticism of an excellent book."
1,Disappointing & Petty Author,"The author seems to have conducted a great deal of research, but his style of writing displays a lack of academic discipline alongside a brutally petty insistence on appearing in the book when it wasn't necessary. I was predisposed to find the material interesting, yet it took discipline just to finish the book because of the logical leaps,ham handed handling of the material, and numerous areas where the author didn't seem to need any proof to actually believe some of his own statements. Very disappointing."
1,what a load of !@#,"if this were billed as fiction, which it actually is, it might be interesting... but this moron tries to claim his views are truth! Gimme a break. He gets so much stuff WRONG, it's hard to believe this ever made it to print. As I said, this belongs in the FANTASY section. I gave it one star because amazon wouldn't let me give it zero stars..."
1,A 3rd Grade Theme Paper Is Easier to Read,"This book is a total load of tripe. The author appears to be a stranger to good grammar and proper spelling. He obviously is the worst kind of religious bigot. People are allowed to have different beliefs than you, bucky. That doesn't make them Satanic. Only an immature teenager would want to be a Satanist anyway, and that appears to be the target market for this book. We are free to believe what we want, and if our concept of God isn't the same as yours, well feel free to crawl back under that rock of hate you peeped out from under.The OTO is a tiny little group that doesn't have much effect on anything. It's easy to find out the real name of their leader, and their so-called secrets have been published many times since their first appearance in German in 1914.I'll bet this author is some loser that got kicked out of the OTO for coming onto chicks and this book is his revenge."
2,Great actors but...,"Beware! my review is focus on moral values not the acting or the cinematographic value of the movie. I thought i was getting a sweet Bollywood romance but this was a western movie in Hindi. So, absolutely not what i'm used to in Indian movie. Maybe I've only seen the old ones but this was not what I expected."
4,From the GoodGora KANK,"KANK is a timely movie about what happens in the real world to real people. Excellent movie and portrayal of life in it's good, bad and ugly. Big B is a riot!"
5,Jamaican Sunset (The Buccaneers Series #3),It was a great book. I would read the series again. I liked the characters and the way Linda Chaikin wove the Gospel message throughout.
2,Unfinished......but otherwise pretty good.,"The book was excellent, but ti needed to be finished. It doesn't tell what happens to Minette and Eric, how everything goes with Geneva and Sophia at Foxemoore, what happens to Mr. Pitt, what happens in England, along with a score of other things. It's like the author wrote a great beginning-middle of a book, and leaving many questions unanswered, finished it. I think she should write a fourht book instead of leaving us all on edge."
3,Conclusion,"This book was not Linda Chaikin's best work, but neither was this whole series. Of course I was hooked after reading the first one, but still it could have been better. I agree with the other people, she could have wrapped a few more things up in the end! But it was pretty good."
4,A better guide to this area,"Although this book is not on a par with my favorite DK books, it's one of the better that I have seen on this area of Florida. The author gives a good list of things to do, places to see, where to eat, and where to stay. It lacks the punch and polish of some of the travel books (...), but it gets the job done.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."
3,Depth Charge,"Decent actioner that won't waste your time. This may be the B variety but Eric Roberts and Corbin Bersen do a good job of keeping your interest. When a prototype stealth sub is hijacked it falls to Bersen to get them off his ship. One by one he takes them out and sabotages their plans to nuke Washington DC. Well worth at least a rental, and maybe a buy if you go in for this kind of action. I enjoy this type movie as I think just because some movies have better budgets doesn't mean they are better movies. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catchFirestorm.CA Luster"
1,No closed captioning or subtitles,"This DVD is not only unrated, but it's unmindful of the hearing-impaired and deaf community by being without both subtitles and closed captions."
2,Dimplex Early Review,"Too new to really rate. Not sure I like the following: There is no height adjustment; everything is equally close to the heat. There is no turn-off, other than pulling the plug. I'm not sure that the heat scale from min. to max. is very discrete. Will have to use it more to come to a better understanding."
3,Need an engineer to assemble,"The grill is fine, once it's put together, but that's easier advertised than done. First, it takes two strong people to lift, hold and maneuver the grill while assembling. Second, it is poorly aligned, so getting screws through the holes is very very difficult. We tried to put it together and finally gave up and called a contractor friend to come and help us. It was impossible to access some of the screw holes, so we gave up on a couple of them -- hoping the assembly will be solid. (It would be helpful if you have a very agile chimpanzee to help you.) After 90 minutes, the three of us got it assembled. This is way too much trouble to expect of a $500 product. If you're planning to do this alone, think again."
3,Magick,"I read this book when I first became interested in Druidry. This book provides some excellent information. Unfortunately this information does not apply to Druidry in whole. This book is more a conglomeration of Celtic Magick, Witchcraft and a very small portion of Druidry. Don't get me wrong, the information is good, just not all Druidry. I recomend this book for those studying European/Celtic Magick versus Druidry."
1,Very SAD attempt to teach Druidry,"This book is filled with nothing more but history tales, legends, opinions, and facts. They comment on the magick, but they never really tell you how to perform anything. I was looking for a real good Druid book, and this title showed up, I foolishly bought it at once and was very dissapointed. If you are like me and enjoy the ""Meat and Potatos"" of the book, I don't suggest this one. However, I do suggest a book called, ""Witches and Wizards"" it's a training program with very good results."
2,ok at best and im being nice,this book for the most part sucked. its only good points where the few spells in it .like the wards and shapeshifting on the astrial plane .a lot of the mitholegy was wrong (im irish i live there)it also doesnt beleave magik affects the world wrong!it can easily (actually the book contradicts itself on that point with the wards the protect others )im actully 16 but cant figure out how to get e-mail working so dont dissreguard me as a child (practising since 7 years)
1,Not at all accurate,This book was horrible....as a practicing Pagan for 11 years now I found it's information both inaccurate and contradicting. I want to stress something to everyone...not every human being with a Ph.D beside their name know's what the hell they are talking about. More than likely many of you are Pagans and know how to go with your gut feeling. After much research and reading I only read books by D.J. Conway or Edain McCoy
2,Not for the advanced or intermediate,"This book may be good for the beginner just starting out their quest or maybe even a beginner/intermediate but if you know all your basic facts and have done research dont bother. I read this book and learned nothing I didnt all ready know. Power comes from the mind not tools or outfits, but often enough this concept is hard to grasp so as I said for the ""beginner""."
4,"Pretty good, if not entirely acurate","I enjoyed the book, though it takes a different, and I think non-historical bent from my other studies. Still it does have good exercises and ceremonies to follow. I would recommend it to anyone who already has a base in druidry."
3,A book for starters,"As a modern druid, i found the book useful and easy to understand. I would have given it a 4 star rating but it lacks historical accuracy and a more in-depth view of druidism.Perhaps that is also its strongest point: being as light as it is, you won't have any trouble to understand it and applying some basic principles of druidism in your daily life. However, if you are looking forward to become a celtic reconstructionistic druid, then you should research elsewhere.Cialllia"
3,background celtic mythology,"I read this with an interest in finding out a bit about my Celtic mythological heritage. I accomplished that, though I think I could have skipped about 80% and still accomplished my goal. Some of it was fun, a lot was ""preachy"". I don't have the scholarly background in Druidry or Celtic mythology that many of the reviewers obviously do, so I'm much less critical of the accuracy of some of the book's assertions, but I took much of it with a large grain of salt. I have no intention of trying to ""become"" a Druid, but the book gave me a good deal of respect for the Celtic/Druid tradition. I wish I'd read more on the subjects discussed here (or perhaps in other references) before our visits to our ancestral Celtic lands, so that the ""sacred"" sites would have stood out even more than they did."
2,Another wasted opportunity....,"As with Robert Smith's Banshees album ""Hyaena"", this collaboration with Banshees bassist Severin is simply a wasted opportunity. It is lazy and self indulgent, and has the unmistakable stamp of drug use all over it. Many of the songs have cool arrangements, and lots of weird noises, etc. But the songs just aren't up to snuff. Topping that off are the bland beyond belief vocals of Ms Landry and you have an exotic mess of psychedelic pastiche that really holds no value. Even the bonus disc of demos with Smith's new vocals on the old demos don't hold any fascination for me, a longtime Cure fan. This one could have stayed in the vaults."
5,Fabulous!,"I should slap myself for not buying this earlier. It is a great album, and I can't stop listening to it. Just buy it. You won't regret it."
2,Not the real deal,"(FIRST EDITION) There are many significant shortcomings in this interactive DVD game. I do not recommend it at all. It is not at all like the real Feud. The most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order, since it reveals them in order, or you lose. No steals, no strikes. Sadly, I can't return it since its a DVD game. I hope the newer versions are better."
4,It is fun,"I owned the previous version of this game and thought it was a bit more fun. BUT this one is fun! Setting aside the TV game show, as a group entertainment game this one is a lot of fun."
3,Family Feud 2,"The game is family fun. But, the scoring does not match the TV show. A team makes a list of 5 answers. Then the game post the real survey results. If you miss one in any order, you lose your turn. On the TV shwo, the team gets to keep guessing they miss 3 matches -- this game doesn't allow any chances. The team loses their turn as soon as they get the wrong answer."
1,One of the Worst,"I bought this book because its on Bill Gates, and was I disappointed or what? The style of writting is very bad, and suits a small article not a book. It is not a biography at all, but an absurd trick to cash in on Bill Gates' Name.You are much better off reading other books on Microsoft and Bill Gates, which go into at least some details on the events of both the company and the man himself. This book was more like a brief news item.For me it was a waste of money. The only reason I am giving it a one star is because I cannot give it any less."
5,Great little flash drive...,"I've bought about eight of these drives in the past year and they work great for a particular use-case I have. I use them with BitLocker drive encryption on Windows 7 Enterprise laptops, and these drives are consistently detected at boot time unlike some other flash drives I've tried. Low price, the right size, and boot time detection/use make these a good choice for my needs. As a plus they have a loop or lanyard so that they are easy to attach to your keys/cases/person."
4,quality plus,"This single really kicks ass, theres no other way to explain it.Great quality metal whatever u wanna call it... They have a unique sound and i recommend this to anyone who is sick of mainstream crap and wants their moneys worth> check it out..."
2,Wheater: not for the beginner,"As a first year medical student, I was required to buy this Atlas. I thought it was a terrible atlas for someone who has never taken histology before. The identification of the structures is minimal and often confusing. I had to buy another atlas to make it through the course. (Difores Atlas of Histology)."
2,same old same old,"In contrast to the other two reviews posted, I have found the new edition of wheaters to be much the same as the old, albeit for a paint job. I feel that my prvious edition of wheaters is so similiar that an upgrade is not worth it. However, the text is generally quite good. An improvement on image resolution and commentary would be a good reason to wait in anticipation for a more revamped edition."
2,A text and an atlas...good at neither,"This text tries to be both a text and an atlas in one and is unfortunately good at neither one. The text is very very basic and lacking in detail. The sections are poorly stained, out of focus and do not clearly demonstrate the structures. The pictures are small and of poor quality. Considering the price, I would recommend spending the extra 30-40 bucks and buy Gartner and Hiatt for an atlas and Junquera for a text instead of paying for this text."
2,ok- could be better,"the book arrived on time, there was some water damage on first 50 pages, first few pages were stuckbut is usable. did someone spill their drink? will have to send it for analysis..could do better"
2,!!!!,"This book is good but not for beginers or medical students. it's complicated and packed with information, that might not be so important for students.doesn't have any clinical correlations. i'd suggest the Basic histology book:text and atlas, rather than this one"
4,Norman Rockwell Train Set,I am very pleased with the quality of this product. It is highly detailed and very rugged. The rails snap together in minutes and are easy to put together and take apart again. Looks great going around the Christmas tree!
4,An engaging study of a family living in the deep South.,"I found this novel engaging and pleasant to read, in the spirit of other Southern writers such as Anne River Siddons. Ms. Battle's explorations of a troubled mother and her adult daughters, intensified by the anxieties of the Christmas holidays, kept me turning the pages at a fast clip. I feel, however, that if Ms. Battle had deleted some of the characters--even one of the three daughters--and more fully developed the others, the novel would have been deeper and more thoughtful."
4,Most believable characters,"At one time I identified with Josie, the mother, and at another, with Lila, one of the daughters. Having reared four children in the south, I can tell you Ms Battle has wonderful, believable characters. I will recommend this book for the October selection for my book discussion club."
3,Interesting Charactors & Storyline,"I liked the characters and their stories and I felt that the book had a good plot. However, why authors feel they need to switch back & forth in time & back & forth with the characters, I'll never know. I would just become intrigued by one of the daughter's situations, when the next chapter would go to a different time and different character. I would have preferred the story told in sequence and with one voice, not the separate voices of each daughter and Josie, their mother."
3,So-so story about a disfuntional family,"I read it to the end because it was like searching for a plot. None of the characters was ever completely developed and when one chapter would end with a cliff hanger, the next chapter was about somebody else in the family. It was disorganized and frustrating. There was an English teacher's list of discussion questions at the end. Boo!"
3,It Was Okay,"I was hoping for a good southern book, like so many others I have enjoyed. I could not really get into the characters or care about them in this book. It was a decent read, but just not what I was hoping for."
4,Good slice-of-life,"This novel is a good read for those who enjoy a slice-of-life evolution as opposed to a strong plot. The characters are the main focus here, as they develop from a family separated by jealousy, misunderstanding, self-centeredness, and plain lack of empathy to compassion with the healing of old wounds. All but the youngest sister--who was never ""fleshed out"" enough to become ""real""-- are well developed: after the conclusion, you wonder how their lives are going."
4,Another Great Read from a Great Romance Author,"I was drawn to this book by the title. I have stayed in many bed and breakfast places. I have also read previous books by the author. I lived in North Carolina for several years and can relate to the ""southern flavor"" of this novel. It is a well written story of mother-daughter relationships as well as women to women relationships. I would recommend thjis book to any one who enjoys a story about regular people with regular problems and emotions."
3,I don't need to stay there!,"I wanted to like this novel, I enjoyed ""Southern Women"" by Lois Battle, but this was not character driven and I never felt I knew enough about any one person to feel engaged in their lives. I did finish the book, but it wasn't the sweet southern experience I was hoping for. Josie the main character I never actually knew what she was feeling of thinking, or what the real problem with her dead husband Bear? All in all it was fair, but not great. If you have time and need something this could work, but there are better books out there."
2,bed and breakfast,"This book was looooooong and tedious. The plot (and I use the term extremely loosely) was contrived, and the conversations were stilted; also, just a tad too much angst. I had read a couple of her other books and thought they were entertaining, but this one was a disappointment."
1,How much of the Season is provided,"I cannot find anywhere how many of Season Two's episodes are in this collection. I see it is three disks to Season One's five disks. If they are single sided, that means there are about 12 episodes in this collection. I don't understand why they insist on splitting it up. I can only believe it is to get more money. Does that mean Volume 2 will have two disks? Will it be priced the same? I will not be purchasing it for that price. I prefer to get the entire season in a collection, not broken up."
4,"Great Show, Great Cost",This a good family show. I bought my copy at walmart for 19.99(plus tax). It is a shame its not the whole season but it still worth the money!!.
1,Big Valley Season Two,"Wrong disk was sent. I ordered Season Two, and received Season One.The refund process went smoothly however..."
1,didn't get big valley season 2 part 1,"I still have not received Big Valley season 2 part 1. So, I order anotherone, and I just got it today Mar. 2, 2009 So, I lost money for the firstone Big Valley season 2 part 1. If I could get my money back I wouldappreciate it THANKS."
2,What a waste!!!,"I thought that Universal was cheap and irresponsible with their DVD seasons, but it just goes to show you that Fox is just as greedy too. I will wait for vol. 2 to see if there is a single unit. Thank god Paramount cares enough to remaster, use reasonable packaging, and no double sided disks."
1,Another Studio Rip-Off,"What a major freaking disappointment. I am sooooo tired of being ripped off. I was so looking forward to Big Valley Season 2 and must echo the remarks of previous reviewers...STOP BREAKING UP THE SEASONS!!!And come on guys...be reasonable and knock off the greedy marketing ploys. Sheeeesh. I WILL NOT purchase this at this price. I can wait for it to be on TV and record it to DVR myself...or...I know where I can get the whole series at once on-line! Screw this rip-off...hope it is boycotted (as I did Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Time Tunnel, Lost In Space, Perry Mason, and all other releases of this inconsiderate type.)Note to Paramount: When the remastered Star Trek Original Series is released: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE be reasonable to the fans who have stood by your product and made it possible for you to reap the rewards throughout the decades. We are the reason you have this cash cow and will continue to support your product...or walk away with a bad taste in our mouths."
3,Great Show!!! Lousy Merchandizing!!,"Once again FOX is sticking it to long-time, loyal fans of these older TV shows. They did it with Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and are doing it to Burke's Law also. Splitting seasons into 2 parts and charging full price. Then, when fans get angry and stop buying(or burn their own off nostalgia TV)they discontinue production leaving us with an incomplete series and really mad. And no extras is just plain lazy!!Are you mad? Then call FOX at FOX Customer Affairs... 1-888-223-2FOX, and give them a piece of your mind.An irate viewer."
1,Is Season 2 really worth that price? No!,"Don't get me wrong--I love Big Valley, it was one of my favorite TV shows right up there with Magnificent Seven, Bonanza, and Highlander, but I completely agree with previous reviews--I will not pay what they want for both parts of the second season. $60 for Highlander was worth it--they put tons of information on every character in every episode, filled the DVD with all kinds of extras, from deleted shots to interviews with the script writers and actors. All the extras made it worth the price.But I am NOT going to pay $60 for nothing but the episodes that are of a quality that I can at least match with my home computer! Like the others who reviewed--I got the eps off of Encore westerns and I'm fine with those and won't pay for the second season unless Fox puts more on the disks!"
4,The Whole Season,"I have found on the internet, two sites that offer the entire series on DVD, has anyone purchased these? They are offering it for $90.00. I don't know if they has special features, don't really care; just want all the episodes. Any help would be appreciated.Thanks"
4,Where are the extra's?,Part of my reason for buying any DVD collection is the extra's you usually get. I was very dissapointed that this was not the case in this set. You would think with 3 out of the 5 stars still living that they could have done something.
5,SEASON 2.3.4.AVAILABLE AMAZON GERMANY,"As Fox won't release the rest of the Seasons on DVD ,due to poor sales, I ventured acrossto Amazon Germany,where all the Seasons are available at very good prices.They are in English & German NO SUBTITLES The Quality is every bit as good as the American Release Season 1Our German friends must be more into buying westerns than the rest of us.From ordering to getting it in the post in Australia in 14 days. Great Service.Highly Recommended.also HIGH CHAPARRAL is available."
5,My Favorite Western,"I agree with those who think we should stop belly-aching about the price. The first season was a bargain, but that doesn't mean the other releases have to cost the same. I love this show and would buy it at just about any price. As someone else has pointed out, if we don't buy the product, the powers that be have no reason to release the rest of the series. That would be a crying shame. Trust me, it can happen. ""Murphy Brown"" isn't going to have any further releases due to lack of sales of the first season. I'm disappointed about the season split, too, but I feel the price is reasonable. Refusing to buy it would be shooting ourselves in the foot."
1,STOP! Save your money,"If you bought Big Valley Season 1, then you don't need to waste your money on Big Valley Season 2,Volume 1. Every episode in this half of season 2 is in the Season 1 package. You heard me right. If you but Season 2 Volume 1, you will get a second copy of what you already have! It leaves me wondering if Season 1 was really complete and if the remainder of Season 2 is really in consecutive order. I can't tell you how upset I was when I opened the package to find repeat episodes! And there's no way to tell what you're getting until the package is completely opened because the titles are not listed on the outer package. Titles are listed on internal DVD vases. Don't waste your money, folks! Buy the first complete season of Big Valley and wait until the release of volume 2of Season 2. Maybe we'll actually get ""new"" old episodes. I feel like such a sucker for buying season 2,volume 1. Don't make the mistake I did!"
3,I bought this for my sister.,She is a really huge fan of the Big Valley TV show and really enjoys rewatching the episodes on DVD.
5,the big valley season 2,i love the big valley i enjoy watching peter breck .and wish they put the whole season 2 on dvd and instead half
5,Big Valley,when is the 2nd Volume of the Second Season of The Big Valley to be release....what is the hold up on it.....how long does it take to release the Volume 2 of a season of the great show ? Does anyone know when .....
5,THE BIG VALLEY,I AM THRILLED TO BE ABLE PURCHASE THIS SERIES.A GOOD QUALITY PRINT..I QUESTION WHY SERIES TWO WAS RELEASED PART ONE...INSRTEAD OF THE COMPLERTE SERIES.BUT NEVER THE LESS A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY COLLECTIONN OF WESTERNS.
3,cost,"I am pleased that Big Valley is continuing to be released and if they want to break up the second season, then fine. BUT I must object to the price that is almost the same price as the entire season one set! What is going on???"
1,"Great series, cheapskate manufacturer","I bought this set assuming that at the price it would at least contain single-sided discs since it was only half of the season. No such luck, they're dualies. Fox should be ashamed of themselves. Total rip-off."
1,movie industry moving in same footsteps as music industry,"the music industry wondered why so many people were illegally obtaining their music and they found out it was simple reason; the people felt like they were being price-gouged. now it seems the movie industry doesnt want to be left out of the loop, so they go after the people that actually pay for the movies and are trying to price-gouge them. i have no sympathy for the studios at all. when they start whining about illegal downloads they better take a look back at putting out a half of a season at the same price as a full season and say ""oh s%#t!, we may have made a mistake"""
1,Have Refrained From...,"...buying the bootlegged version, because I wanted to wait for the official releases. But I think I change that decision now. If I want to be ripped off, I prefer the little street pick-pocket taking my money instead of the mafia boss."
1,"Thanks, but no Thanks","SHAME ON THE PEOPLE AT FOX... Most of the people that grew up on the Big Valley are not exactly spring chickens.Your sales window is closing as we get older. You might think Fox's interest would be in high volume sales. To give a half Season for the same cost as the whole first Season, is a slap in the face to all baby boomers..Thanks, But No Thanks"
5,Want More,"I am truly disappointed. I have been waiting on the final seasons of Big Valley for a long time. If they weren't going to do the whole season, they shouldn't have started at all. It doesn't make since having customers waiting, then spliting the seasons up. I hope they decide to put the rest on dvd very soon."
1,Who picked this cover art?,"The cover picture does not include cast member Richard Long and to add insult to injury, two pictures of Lee Majors. Just because Lee Majors and Linda Evans went on to do a lot more television, let us not forget the others and their contributions to this great show. I hope the company will correct this glaring mistake before the release date!"
3,"High Maintanence, Low Output, but Good Features","The Product data on this page says ""Other items by Holmes"". Not sure what that means; this is a Bionaire humidifier with a remote sensor/controller. The feature set it great; it's quiet, cool ""mist"", no white mineral deposits/dust in the room, etc. But it also requires a complex weekly cleaning, expensive wicks regularly, cannot output much humidity (the wick dries out instead of keeping up) and the wicks are fragile.The weekly cleaning includes sanitizing the water resevoir, scrubbing out the base, removing and deliming the float, and reassembling all. The wicks are fragile but also are harmed by minerals in the water, so replacements may be needed every month or two, at about $6 per when you can find them.Humidifier technology still has room for improvement. This is one of the better units out there, due to the remote sensor (so the room is measured, rather than the air around the unit), but it's not just a plug it and forget it model."
3,"Good try, but the devil's in the details","I bought this to take care of my piano. I don't trust the in-piano humidifiers; humidifying the whole room is a MUCH better idea.The ""Galileo"" idea is excellent for this: put a remote sensor near the piano, and keep the humidifier across the room. Voilà! Even consistent humidification!Oh, but wait ... the humidity sensor is wildly miscalibrated, off by 10% or more. The fan, while not deafening, is loud enough to be quite irritating. The filters grow mildew quite quickly, and sometimes need monthly replacement -- especially if the humidity is not too low and the fan runs only occasionally. The rubber seal on the tank wears out over time.Good concept. Flawed execution."
4,A Reality Tour Document,"After watching this DVD on two seperate systems and being an unbiased bowie fan this is a well shot document of the reality tour shows. This filmed in Dublin is a nice blend of songs that that changed over the course of the tour. Check out ""Loving The Alien"" for one great voice. Tony Visconti mix is right on. The effects added to the film complement and enhance the bore of most live concert films. If you have problems with this DVD you might need to use some Q-Tips and get new glasses."
4,why the ***ck did they join two shows together again????,"Bowie's concert releases have never been in full!!despite all the criticisms of the editing, for me, anyhow, the most disapointing thing is that the DVD delivered a joined concert, just like the glass spider tour or the moonlight tour, and the ZS tour, why??? why don't they just fully capture one complete concert for us?? the feeling is being cheated. whwho can tell me which part is from which night?? please."
1,Bowie - A crack in the past,"Let your drummer be a slave to his click-track and you end up with a monster like this: no soul, no funk, all very programmed.Very boring versions of some of the best songs ever written.Painful to see that the devine David Bowie ends up like a struggling karaoke-singer.And I'm not sure if there's any hope for the future.Please surprise me."
4,Just a concert.,"David and the band can do no wrong in my eyes. This was a lovely experience. However, having been to the Columbus and KC concerts, I was totally ready to be able to have a momento of my experience and...the cinematography on this DVD is a complete let down. And there were no 'extras.' I was looking forward to some Easter eggs or SOMETHING, but it was a straight shot concert. Maybe I was just spoiled by the BoB DVD..."
4,Short and sweet review,"Singing - 5Selection of songs - 5Filming - 3: I like artsy, but watch it in the dark and you'll feel like you're being followed by paparazzi at some points... BRIGHT!!Audio (i'm a true audiophile) - 3.5: Have they heard of 5.1 or DTS? This is 2005! Should be the standard for concert videos.Price - 5: for 9.99 I really don't have a right to complain about any of the above!"
3,"Great concert, poor filming","I saw this show live about a year ago and although it dragged a bit (30+ songs!) I was most excited about this disc. Mainly to see the funky animation used during Bowie's performance of ""I'm Afraid of Americans."" But, of course, instead of some wide shots capturing Mickey Mouse & Capt. America we get nothign but close-ups with the occasional quick glance at the animated kids break dancing. What a waste."
2,This is NOT reality,"One of the import versions of David Bowie's REALITY cd includes a bonus dvd disc of a concert from somewhere in Asia. The bonus dvd on that import is just a straightforward multicamera shoot, with no fancy special effects. And yet it is a thousand times better than this A REALITY TOUR dvd! Granted, the A REALITY TOUR has a more extensive set list, but the editing of this video - the processing of every minute of the video to make it look unreal - ruins the experience by distancing the viewer from the performance. One complaint about the performance is that I'd rather have seen Bowie have a full range of backup singers rather than employing whatever tricks were employed to flesh out the sound. That probably would not have seemed a problem if the rest of the video (the visual treatment) had been more honest. But altogether, it is as if the real show is hidden from the viewer."
4,Music is great!,"The music and performance were great,the direction and editing just ok. As others have mentioned,there was no need for all the special effects and tight shots. Bowie is fantastic and does not need any special effects help. Still,the sound makes it all worth while."
4,Great Concert Video,"Perhaps not as great as being at the live show, but this Dublin concert was captured very nicely on a lengthy and interesting DVD. Having seen Bowie three times on this most recent ""A Reality Tour,"" it's great to be able to have a keepsake to remind me of how great he still is live. Also a treat to see him trot out old gems like ""Be My Wife"" and ""Fantastic Voyage."""
4,Still worth it.,"Michael Thomas Roe's comments are bang on.This is a great concert spoiled by a director with ADD. And the sound isn't that good either: both the stereo mix and the 5.1 seemed a little muddy to me.But if you always meant to see a Bowie concert and never got around to it, this is the DVD for you. Inspite of it's ""faults"" it still shows a master at work.I loved every minute."
5,A Great Memento From A Great Tour,"I am a Bowie ""fanatic"" since I was 13, so i might be a little""biased"". I saw David Bowie at the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh,Pa, and it probably was the BEST concert I have been to in a long time! I agree with some of the previous reviewers,Bowie easily performed like a man half his age, the DVD gives you a ""hint"" of that, being there ""live"" was BEST!This DVD is a great memento of a great tour, by a guy who really is AWESOME in concert. My only criticism is not getting ""Queen Bitch"" as one of the songs included, or ""Station to Station"", butI still LOVE IT! Thanks David!"
3,Disappointing but good value,"I saw Bowie in concert during the Reality Tour and thought he was fantastic! However, the DVD is a letdown, especially from the tech savy and creative David Bowie.I concur with other reviews that the video editing is terrible. I also think the video quality is at best OK and the audio is lifeless. Although I'm a big Bowie fan, I was disappointed with the DVD and never even finished watching it. It definitely does not capture the energy level and quality of the concert.However, as others have said, it is a good concert souvenir. The best part of this DVD is the price. For such a low price it's a deal for the Bowie fan."
3,its ok but could be better,its an ok dvd set but it would be better with the tabs with it.he also doesnt say where each note is played.slow down the lesson rock house its not a race.
4,Re-release of her only album in portuguese,"The content of the album is exactly the same as Libertad-En Espanol, which is a great album of mostly latin classics. This version in Portuguese however gives the songs somewhat a new sound. Orginally released in Portugal and Brasil as Liberdade it's been reissued here which should be much appreciated by her great following and show her fans another aspect of Nana's great artistry. Unique because it's her only recording in portuguese!"
5,Great Book for Beginners,"This book is an excelent starting place for those who have ever wanted to install a pond or stream in their yard. It gives complete instructions about planning, purchasing, and building outdoor water gardens. It even lists the varieties of fish and plants to put in your pond. It also has a section on winter care of your ponds. This was helpful to me because it gets very cold during the winters where I live, and I needed to know what to do to ensure the success of my pond. Overall, this is a great book!"
4,Very Informative,"Have always had goldfish and their like but had never gone beyond the aquarium before. Finally this year I had the chance and the desire to build a pond. Of course I needed some help and this was the book I picked up.I found this book to informative and helpful much like many other books on the topic, but what had sold me was the winter care part, seeing as my pond is in that mode six months out of the year..."
5,Great first water garden book,"I bought this book to help plan a water garded. It is easy to read, keeps your interest, answered my questions, and had good pictures.I also bought ""The Pond Doctor""(not as good for a first book, but good reference book), and ""Pond Basics 3"" (a pamphlet from Emperor Aquatics, quick read and short answers)."
4,Good Stuff About Kid's Stuff,"This is a book about toys that nicely balances an historical analysis of mass-manufactured toys and their appeals to children, with a look at current toys and their appeals. Mr. Cross has a unerring eye for what toys say about past and current culture. While he is critical of some of today's toys and the type of play they encourage, such as fantasy violence toys, he is not a public scourge suspecting toy companies of base motivations. Instead, his opinions are considered and grounded in historical observation. Too, he seems to have a soft spot for Marx toys -- those cheap, antic, crazy, tin and plastic toys that spoke to a kid's sense of chaos and anarchy -- in other words, the toys that were the most fun of all!"
3,bluing blues,"iv'e had great success in the past with blue wonder, but this last bluing job was a struggle, i'm wondering if with the price of gold sky rocketing and gold being one of the bluing ingredients along with other precious metals, if the company has cut back on these ingredients making for a not so good bluing job?? i'm dissapointed with what was a great product, or did i just get a not so good batch?"
3,Ok book,It's ok. Nothing phenomenal and a good beginner book. Advanced people will be left cold and dry by this one. But for those new to the art this is a good start covering the Rider Waite Smith deck well. Still I found his writing dry and lifeless so this book is definitely a matter of taste. Not much on reading with the cards more on the history and symbolism. For reading the cards I recommend Power Tarot by Phyllis Vega.
3,A tolerable adventure--but not worth searching for,"A fairly good introduction to Ravenloft for DMs and players, but yet seems to fail to provide the necessary level of horror that the writers of Ravenloft materials are always stressing. Certain elements seem glossed over, and other suggestions are impossible to carry out. A chase scene is called for, but based on the map, it seems hard for a chase scene to ensue--there is much space between houses and one does not get the sense that in this small town anything resembling an alley or a wrong turn could actually exist. Despite an attempt to create an atmosphere of horror, the action seems largely driven by a gradual increase in number and strength of opposing creatures. There are other adventure modules for low level players still in print that are also more interesting. The one benefit of Night of the Walking Dead is its brevity--it can be completed in two or three sessions."
5,Was great,Im very happy with this product. I've gotten a few things Wayne books. I'm very pleased with them and I keep their site in my bookmarks. It got here in timely maner and it was as it said it was.
2,Lid does not make a water tight seal,I bought 3 of these lids for my Cambro 2qt & 4qt containers. The containers are well made and very serviceable. These lids do not make a water tight seal on the containers. I can use them for dry goods but not for liguids that might spill out when the container(s) are tipped.
4,Grandkids loved it!!,I bought this for my granddaughters and they loved it. They like just about anything with dinosaurs in it. The reason for the four stars is because I believe they could have done so much more with this story and made it a bit longer. With children they seem to like more action and there is action with this but it would have been nice to see more character emphasis. I know I am writing this as an adult though so since the granddaughters liked it then it must have met their expectations.
5,if your boy loves dinosaurs!,"if you have a little one that loves dinosaurs, they will love this movie. it's perfect for little kids. my son (3) has been watching it on repeat since we got it....a week ago. and at least its something different from land before time, which are great movies but its nice to see some different characters."
5,Love the Dinosapians...the cg's are the best ever !!!,"When I want to just relax and enjoy the afternoon, this is at the top of my list, and the movie was inexcellent condition, including the outside case ! ThankYou !!!"
1,inaccurate-,I found this book to be full of errors- I went to two recommended eataries- both were out of business. Also book reported changing of the guard occurs every day in August- guess what? It does not! Does not seem that very careful fact checking went into this book.
2,"Pretty Pictures, but......","This is a good book, if you want to see decent and good sized reproductions of Pollock's works. So it's good for that, with minimal insight into the man, or if you want some insight into the man who made these amazing and breakthrough paintings. what his inner demons were and why and how they affected his work.Not the book. Some deride ""Jackson Pollock: An American Saga"" the Pulitzer Prize winner Bio by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith, as gossipy. Well, mostly because they don't say, but present some evidence that Pollock might have had homosexual tendencies.That says more about the people and reviewers that say that, and their homophobic attitudes, than what is actually in the book. Heaven forbid that the man who changed American Art was Gay. If you want pretty, good sized reproductions of Pollock's work, this is the book for you. If you want some insight into the man who made the works- ""Jackson Pollock: An American Saga"" is the explanation."
4,Extensive and as expected,This book was received in very good condition and includes both plenty of images of the work and information about it and the artist.This is a staple for any artist or lover of art.
5,amazing,"This book covers the works of Gaddis, exclu8ding Agape Agape, with incredible depth and sweep. A book certain to increase one's appreciation of one of the greatest of authors. those interested in the aesthetic elements in all of Gaddis work will truly benefit. Knight discusses the role of the artist, Flemish painting, and Abstract Expressionism of America in Greenwich Village in the 50s with tremendous facility. He also reads J R in a very Platonic way, namely, in light of the role of the examined life and the question as to how one should, but couches it in consideration of the postwar capitalist nation of America. Excellent, Excellent."
3,"Little dated, little too general","This book is geared primarily towards art criticism. Though it seems to try to be accessible to all disciplines, I found it lacking in anything citable. I would recommend this to someone who has no arts background and needs to basically get the jargon down. I bought this used to see if it might be applicable to Visual Rhetoric. It is not. It is more like a book you would find in an intro to art class at a university. It is scholarly, just not very applicable to most theses."
1,Nostalgic at best,"I bought these thinking they would be as cool as I remembered. They weren't, in fact the software is outdated, and I had a hard time installing them on my newer PCs. The game play was frustrating and not easy to manipulate. Basically technology has changed so much that your initial instinct on how to play the game is not usually correct. We had to learn by trial and error, mostly error. It was overall not a fun and rewarding experience, forget about educational. We spent more time trying to figure out how to play the game than we did learning anything."
5,Helpful for exam prep...,"This guide was a concise and clear way to review the exam material quickly and throughly. I recommend it as a study tool to prep properly for the exam. I used this along with a few outlines from my classes, as a supplement, and I passed the exam yesterday in the first 90 questions. The exam was easier than the study guide's practice tests...if you do well with the practice exams, you'll be fine on the real deal."
4,I passed the exam,"The exam was difficult, but this book helped more than any other single piece of consolidated text. I recommend you also take the NCTRC practice exam, and study the books from which they get the answers because this book does not go in depth as far as information needed to pass the exam. It is most useful because of the many test questions offered and being able to pinpoint which sections are your weak and strong points."
3,Not as good as his first,"The usual fare and not as exciting as his first big band concert.The song selections duplicate much of the first concert, hence my reservations.If you have the first dvd, stay with it. If not available, then buy this one as last resort.Production is professional and has good picture and sound.That's it!"
1,All pieces too slow & quite similar,"This CD contains quite a lot of pieces, but the speed is generally too slow and a lot of the pieces sound very similar. If I used this CD for a whole class, the students will fall asleep during the first 5 minutes!!!!"
5,Pas De Chat-Music for Ballet Class,This has been my favorite cd for over a year! My students love it and it is excellent for all levels but especially for intermediate and advanced levels of ballet class. A Must Have!
1,Disappointment,I purchased a Dreamate Sleep Aid Wristband in October of 2007 through Amazon from Unbeatable Sale. The first wristband didn't work & was exchanged without a problem. The velcro closer of the second wristband fell off. I e-mailed Unbeatable Sale & the HIVOX company several times but never received an answer. The wristband is guaranteed for one year. I am most angry at the lack of response that by the product.
3,Christmas,"The wrong product was shipped, but was quite timely corrected and with wonderful customer service. The product is a gift."
5,Highway help and what to see,My husband and I used this book this summer driving from Michigan to Oregon and back. It was invaluable and I would highly recommend its purchase.
4,A Walk on the Wild Side,"I started to read this book because I am a fan of Confederacy of Dunces, but now I am a fan of Jerry Strahan. Here is a educated man that has lived a life in a world of transients and street people that I will never know. I feel I have had an up close and personal visit to the strange but real world of misfits - hookers, hustlers and folks that will never be my suburban idea of normal. Thanks for the trip."
3,Fun on a Bun,"Jerry Strahan reveals what it is like to manage the most colorful characters in the most colorful place in the country. This is a television sitcom that gives you a great feel for New Orleans. Having given up meat to start the year, this really tested me. I can not wait to get to New Orleans and try my first ""8 inches of fun on a bun"""
5,"Freakishly funny, proof that fact is stranger than fiction.","This book was great. The real life accounts of the author as he was manager of Lucky Dogs, the hotdog vending company in New Orleans' French Quarter, is amazing. The people that he describes will blow your mind, and entrance you completely. From stories of Frenchy (a huge Canadian boxer) beating everything in sight, to transvestites and homosexuals hitting on customers. The lovers spats, roberies, and assualts are all part of the charm of Lucky Dogs and what make Managing Ignatius the entertaining book it is. Put it this way: After reading Managing Ignatius I informed my parents that as soon as I arrive in New Orleans I'm headed to the Quarter for a job."
4,"Fun, Entertaining Book","Bought this book on a Tuesday night at 9:30PM, was done by midnight the following day (and I had to work that day). Hard to put down.One of the advantages to jobs at the low-end of the labor pool is one comes in contact with such a broader spectrum of characters than in say, a corporate office. You end up with a lot of stories to tell. In this case, most of the characters are the hot dog vendors that the author must try to manage.From vendors who warm their shoes and socks in the bun steamer to the author's own negotiating with loan sharks and pimps on behalf of his employees, this book recounts over 20 years spent hawking dogs in New Orleans' french quarter.A very fun read."
5,"Lovable, Wacky Hot Dog Vendors","This book is part hilarious comedy, part tragedy. It is a walk on the edge that most of us will never experience. This book so accurately portrays the downtrodden and their trials and tribulations without judgement, pity or disrespect. I enjoyed every page. I hope we see more from this author, the true king and manager of the real-life confederacy of dunces."
5,QB1 Cable,"This cable is longer than the one on my original QB1, which makes it easier to handle the battery when shooting with a tripod (there is an accessory to allow mounting the battery between the camera and the tripod). This cable attaches to the battery differently from my original but seems to be more secure."
4,SENSATIONAL !!!,"Waiting for VARESE SARABANDE to release this cd seemed like forever. It's many of Al Hibbler's great DECCA sides. (The original) ""Unchained Melody"", ""After The Lights Go Down Low"", ""Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me"", ""11th Hour Melody"",""He"" plus others show the scope of this great performer. I know that Al Hibbler's admirers are grateful that he was somehow able to look inward, and bring a very special light out of the darkness for all of us to hear in this great compilation of his hits. IF YOU LOVE HIBBLER, You GOTTA BUY THIS ONE."
4,Are there two versions?,"I believe there are two versions to this book. I love'd the other version that I borrowed from a friend and when I got this one and started to re-read it, discovered a different story. Any way, I like this one too and will be searching for the story my friend had. If you have a die hard fairy lover in the family this is a must read. But, be warned, if they are under the age of 10 they must be told no fairies were harmed in the making of the book. My 4 year olds cried for hours when I first got the book and was telling my husband the theme. Written to look like a real diary, it draws you in."
1,Aqua Sphere swim goggles for kids,Ordered these goggles for 4 yr.old grandson for Christmas 2010. He just started using them a few weeks ago. The lens over the right eye cracked! Would never buy another pair. Obviously you have sold me a pair of defective goggles for kids not to mention the danger that the lens could have presented if it had completely broken through and cut his eye! Grateful that that didn't happen. Very very disappointed in this product.
3,has pros and cons,"The 'panoramic vision' is great, but the straps/buckle are really hard to adjust. Several swimming instructors had problems with it. Also, after about a few months of usage for just 1/2 hr a week, water started leaking in. It's as if the silicone wore out. The swimming instructors had to tighten it so much (to get it leak free) that red marks are left on my kid's face. We are switching back to the 'standard' swim goggles."
4,perfect fit seals very well.,"Got this in mid summer, and my 4.5 yrs daughter adjusted to it in the first try. it is well sealed from water, and does not leave face marks if you don't do it too tight. the side adjuster is comfortable to use for loosening it. the only thing is hair sometimes gets in it and you need to take it off gently. if you have a long haired child , you'll need to make a pony tail in a height that will fit in between the two straps, and that will prevent the straps from slipping down and back.these are very good swimming goggles"
2,I like Auqa Sphere but not fit for 3-4 years old kid,My 7 years old son is using the small size of adult Aqua Sphere Swim Goggle and he is so much satisfied it. Then I ordered this kids goggles for my 4 years old girl. However it's not fit and water comes through the gap between nose and goggle. It's clear & pretty pink color but I can not use it any more or wait for another 2-3 years to fit.
2,strap broke,"My daughter loved this swim goggle, until about 9 days of use, the strap broke. We are very disappointed, because it was a more expensive swim goggle."
5,Very good goggles.,"These fit my 3 1/2 year old twins great. The best feature is the little ""release clasp"" on each side of the goggles which makes the goggles a breeze to tighten. Cause let's get real... we know a 3, 4 or 5 year old can't really put the goggles on themselves and tighten them. These were designed with adults in mind.They fit their faces/heads wonderful, with minimal leakage. The leaking is always because I've either tightened too much or not enough.Good purchase. Worth the money."
5,Perfect!,"I got these goggles for my daughters to use during swimming lessons. They were having a hard time putting their faces in/heads under the water because it hurt their eyes, thus making it hard for them to learn what they needed to learn! These goggles are big, but they fit very nicely and the girls love them. The straps are easy to adjust and overall were very comfy. They didn't seem to fog up or leak, like so many other goggles."
4,Best we've tried,Buying our 3rd set for young kids - be sure to rinse off after swimming as chlorine can eventually degrade the seal and then they leak...
5,Great Goggles!! My kids love them,I ordered these for my daughter for her swim class. They seem to fit her face very well and she hasn't complained. My son will be using them next summer for his swim lessons and then I'll order a pair in pink for my daughter.
5,Easy put on Goggle for kids without hurting,"My kids is afraid swimming due to sensitive eyes. We tried many different kid's googles, which are either belt too tight or eye's shape too small. Aqua sphere seal kid swim goggle is the final goggle for my 3.5 years old kid use to join his swimming classes because of easy belt adjustment from simple chips on both sides and big eye's shape."
5,Better than goggles,"Highly recommended. I bought these for my 5 year old son who was afraid of getting his eyes wet and going under water. They cost a little bit more than the regular goggles, but well worth it. They don't fog up, water never gets in them like regular goggles. The strap is so easy to adjust. I love them! He can put them on himself with not problem and they are very durable. Towards the mid summer he got the confidence to swim under water with them on and by the end of the summer was going under with out them."
2,Started leaking after a few weeks,"I purchased two of these goggles for my swimming toddlers after reading the rave reviews about fit. For the first couple of weeks they were great and I was a big fan. I rinsed them after every use and stored them in the original packaging. However, after about 2-3 weeks of use both of them started leaking and I can't seem to figure out why - other than the gasket has already lost its shape and cannot form a complete seal anymore. Very disappointing. Both of my kids ask to use their old individual eye goggles (that they hated before) after about 15 minutes of having to empty water out of these Aqua Spheres each time they go under. Wouldn't recommend for 3 or 4 year olds."
3,Not good for toddlers (3-4 years old),"I bought these for my 3 year old son, who is scared of the water (and has a pretty big noggin). I had hoped that if he didn't have to worry about getting water in his eyes, he might be okay. But they don't even come close to fitting. The nose piece, since it isn't adjustable, didn't form a seal at all, and the one time that my husband was able to get it to form a seal on our son, it pinched his nose shut so he couldn't breathe! I tried them on myself and was able to get a seal formed, but it pinched my nose shut as well.It should be stated that these are a great product other than that. I love the adjustable band, the way it locks into place so there isn't any slipping is nice. For a child 5+ these will probably be wonderful. Still on the search for a good set of goggles for our son..."
5,Great Goggles,"I bought this pair for for my daughter when she was 18 months old. She was taking ISR lessons and we were swimming almost daily. She cried when we tried to put on regular goggles. The rubber straps would pull on what little hair she had making her scream. The tightening and fastening design is what drew me to these AQUA SPHERE SEAL swim goggles. I can easily slip on the goggles and tighten the straps on each side.My daughter is almost 3 and we still use the goggles, however, she has much more hair now and it gets caught in the release button when we take them off. She doesn't scream so much as say, ""Owie! Owie!"" Being mindful of this makes a tangle happen less often and overall the ease of putting them on makes up for the possibility of a slight pain in taking them off.If they need goggles, these are the best option for babies and toddlers."
5,Will not fit everyone,"Good goggles but design will not fit everyone. It's silicone skirt is flexible and fits well, however plastic frame does not flex and does not easily wrap around face. If this kind of goggles do not work try Leader brand that, by comparison, is more flexible and easier to put on but does not provide wide angle view.Beside nice viewing angle, Aqua Sphere goggles offer the easiest way of adjusting the strap out of all goggles we've tried."
4,Replaced,"We got these as a replacement after our boy lost the first pair we got him third time out, he was bummed so we surprised him with a new pair"
2,Great but !,"This is a really good goggle and very kind to the kids face, no stress marks around the eyes, and it looks cool too and different. BUT and a big but there, the straps are easily broken and I have replaced them twice and didn't bother replacing them a third time."
4,Good but not great,"These masks have a lot of great reviews about how well they fit and don't leak etc. I would disagree slightly. Our family likes the way they fit like a mask vs regular goggles. But to say they don't leak is a bit misleading. All 4 of my kids have had some issues with leaking. If they don't make the mask as tight as they can and literally push it onto their face to make a suction, they will leak. I am also a bit concerned at how easily the lenses will scratch. The plastic seems very soft. One good toss across the pool decking and they are going to be scratched. Don't keep them in the case after use and they will get scratched by putting them in a bucket or box with all the other swim toys. The straps are nice and easy to adjust but they don't always hold their adjustment. To be honest, I am not all that impressed with these as the end all be all for swim goggles etc. Good but not great."
3,Not watertight,"My 8-year old daughter had been using these for about 6 weeks now, and no matter how tightly we adjust them or how we place them on her face (low on bridge of nose, high on bridge of nose), they leak within 3-4 minutes of use. They are comfortable, and she likes the increased range of vision; however, if they allow water in, they're not fulfilling the intended purpose. It is possible that they don't fit her well because she is quite petite with a smaller nose-bridge; however, one would think that at 8 years of age, a goggle advertised as a child's goggle should fit."
5,I love them!,These are a little big for my son's face but we love them. He has room to grow into them so mommy is pleased about that. Daddy wants a pair for himself...too cute. They seal around my son's face and he is excited to see underwater. Theses goggle made him more cooperative for swim lessons.
4,not perfect,I bought it for my 7 years old daughter and she loves it. Very convenient and well made. Easy to adjust. Flexible. I bought it second time because first was broken off in the summer camp.Update.I bought another one and it leaks.
2,They work well until the plastic starts cracking,"I purchased these goggles in June for my daughter and within three months the plastic that seals against the face started to fray. The fraying is continuing to get worse. Until that point I would have given them a 5 star because they do seal well, are comfortable, and she is able to tighten the goggles very easily. But now that they can't keep the water out they are worthless. I will see if the company will refund my money or replace them."
4,Kids love it & use it,We have two 3 year olds and this is perfect for them. Easy to adjust (lengthen to take off and tighten to wear) and had good/fitting seals to keep water out (unless divining in head first). Perfect for pool or in ocean - has lasted one season so far (with wash/rinse after each use) and should last at least one (or more) season.
2,The next edition needs to be set in far larger typefaces . . .,"The main problem with Bardakjian's textbook is that the typefaces -- both roman and Armenian -- are extraordinarily tiny. Because the Armenian alphabet has more than several letters that resemble one another, new Armenian readers are served poorly by these inexplicably small fonts. The textbook also suffers from a lack of exercises, and the few exercises that are printed at the end of each chapter have no answer key."
1,Useless for those who doesn't speak Armenian,"This book just shows you the letters in couple pages, and everything else is written with armenian letters with english translations next to it. In the beginning, all letters are listed in couple pages, and author expects you to master the letters in those couple pages and start to read the language on the rest of the book! There's no way you can pronounce these words by just studying letters in those couple pages. How do you suppose to learn the languagage by trying to read letters you've never seen and practiced in your life before? I don't know what the writer was thinking about this when he wrote the book. And if you want to buy the tapes, there's a ""not very informative"" tape purchase option in the last page.I assume this book is written to teach how to read and write Armenian for those who already know how to speak Armenian. Totally useless and even more frustrating book for those who doesn't speak Armenian and trying to learn from scratch."
1,dangerous,"I have 5 Bionaire humidifiers, and the newest one sparked and caught on fire inside in the middle of the night, w/ a strong electrical burning smell. Luckily, sound and smell woke me up so I could unplug it. The company refused to do anything about it when I called, and the service person was perfunctory throughout -- clearly had dealt with similar calls and had a standard kiss off script. Seems like a big decline in manufacturing standards, plus terrible customer service -- won't buy this brand again."
3,disappointed,"The remote would not sync with the humidifier, meaning that the humidifier constantly beeps trying to connect to the remote - kind of annoying. The humidifier part is cool and moist, but when I called into customer service, they couldn't even come up with a way to fix it. It seems to be a problem with this model apparently."
1,Takes two to Tango,"Keeping it simple - the last I checked it takes two to tango and two teams to play a football game. From the DVD it appears that Southern Califronia played the game alone. As I recall, Penn State was also on the field."
5,Perilous Journey Review,"I really, really liked the book because Peyton Lewis is my grandma so it wwas cool to learn about my history. A lot of my friends have cool backrounds, before Perilous journey I didn't think we had anyone cool in my family. Now when someone asks do you have any relatives that did something cool? I can say My great great with a lot more greats, grandmother helped found Nashville Tennessee!"
3,Cheaper Elsewhere,"This product is cheaper at Kmart, it runs $9.99 at my local store. I could understand a few dollars difference but this much difference is a little ridiculous."
4,igloo 7 quart cooler,"this is a good lunch box for in all weather, you do need to add an ice block and freeze drinks in hot weather. only 4 starts because the 'closing' mechanism feels like it is cheaper than it was a few years back in this model. I do wonder how long they will last."
1,Locking Mechanism Broke First week,I bought this cooler to replace a lost older version. The locking mechanism broke the first week I used it. I paid $27 because of shipping cost. Not worth it. A cheaper version of what used to be a great product.
3,Did the job but could be improved,Used this to replace an Air/fuel sensor on an RSX-S and it did the job just fine. My only concerns are that it is barely deep enough to accomodate the sensor and so the wires had to be bent practically at the point they left the sensor to allow the socket to push home. I also noted that the inside edge where the wires exit the socket was quite sharp so as a precaution I wrapped some electricians tape around the cables first to prevent damage. I'm glad I did as the tape had been cut into when I was finished. For $10 you can't really complain and as you only really use this for final tightening and to torque to specification so its failings aren't a show stopper.
4,A great way to spend a weekend,"This is a collection of nineteen articles by well-regarded specialists in medieval English history, including such notables as Marjorie Chibnall (writing on Orderic Vitalis) and Sidney Painter (with a reprint of his 1935 article on castle garrisons). Some of the papers consider particular castles, like Hedingham and Orford, or fortifications in particular areas, like Scotland or the Welsh marches. But castles didn't exist in a cultural or political vacuum, so there's also quite a lot here on the Bayeux Tapestry, Alan of Brittany and the honour of Richmond, the Anarchy and the building programs of Matilda and Stephen, and the effects of castle architecture on later, nonmilitary construction projects. Any medievalist will therefore find a great deal of interest, and there's also a useful bibliography (which is actually pretty long to be, as it warns, ""selected"")."
2,Experience the Point: The Unofficial Guidebook to Cedar Point,"The book was somewhat informative on each individual ride but it did not spend enough time on lodging and restaurants. Also, the information given in the book was from 2002. The book states that Cedar Point boasts 13 roller coasters. In fact, they now have 17. Because the book is so dated, the estimated prices given in the budgeting section are not even close. If you read this book and use the budgeting section as a guide, you'll fall over backwards when you actually call to make your reservation. For these reasons, I can not recommend this book."
1,the very unofficial guidebook,"This book is writen with the language of a child. It does make the book easy to understand overall but also makes the reading of it a little annoying. I found little of the book interesting or helpful, most of the book's information was not at all helpful to someone who has visited CP before. this book would be perfect for children before their first trip to the point."
4,garden scents,"Attractively packaged, this is a nice set of soaps for gift-giving, though too highly perfumed for allergic types like me."
1,Dissapointed,"After receiving this book I went back to see why I chose it... It was from a link from one of the authors to a book that I purchased that was wonderful. Needless to say, they highly recommended it.Wow, what a dissapointment. Are you REALLY supposed to put pre-cooked hot dogs and cheese in foil and then bury in the sand to cook - again? That doesn't sound safe to me. That is just one of the recipies that calls for that method.I am really glad I bought it used because really, It wasn't worth the postage I paid. This is the first purchase I have ever been truly dissapointed in. Nothing it is was imaginative or creative - truly not worth getting."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My old laptop is in really bad shape but still usable with the right attachments, but this little piece worked fine for a couple of months and then Windows couldn't recognize this piece of hardware. What happened? No one knows, it doesn't come with a manual or any other information about the manufacturer. I tried in my other laptop and my desktop with the same result... Don't even think about it, no matter how cheap it is... And there isn't any 5.1 functionality at all!"
3,"enjoyable, but no subtitles?","this release includes a mini-documentary about cecilia and a full-length concert in england. the mini-documentary is entertaining as it shows a very young cecilia (24 years old) at the beginning of what has become a one in a million career. the interviews are with her mother, a british record producer, the editor of opera magazine, and, of course, cecilia. also included are some segments showing cecilia's daily life, rehearsing with her mother, cooking, recording, and driving around. the concert is for the most part enjoyable; mostly art songs and a few arias, and in general very heavy on the rossini. highlights include an absolutely stunning slow song by vivaldi and ""una voce poco fa"" from rossini's barber of seville. however, the front camera-view was consistently shaky (distractingly so), and my biggest gripe is that there are no subtitles for the entire concert! surely this would've been an easy thing to do, esp. since not all of the selections are well-known."
4,Excellent,"It's pretty good overall. I read it and my kindle reads for me as well. But due to the large amount of pictures, it's recommended to buy a real book cuz it is after all an art history book"
3,Nancy Drew season 2,We have come a long way with our television shows and acting skills.Lots of interesting stories ut not really relevant for today. These dvds would really only interest those that are fans of this tv show when it came out years ago. My kids like them but at the same time got a big kick out of the styles and interesting dialog. I liked seeing some of the stars when they were younger.
4,Good series,I purchased this series (season) because I grew up watching it and thought that my nephew might enjoy it. I brought back some memories of that time - some of which never happened :). But I would still recommend this product.
5,Having fun reliving my childhood.,I am so happy the studios are releasing all this classic late '70's early '80's tv on DVD. I recently bought Buck Rogers so this will be a nice addition to the collection. And the HB/ND was such a great pairing that I am surprised that the CW never capitalized on creating a Mystery Night with Veronica Mars/Supernatural. It's practically the same thing right down to Keith being a modern day Carson.RIP VM - I will miss you!!!
3,Hardy Boys & Nancy Drew Season Two,"I didn't like the fact that the actress that played Nancy Drew was changed in season two. Other than that, I enjoyed this season. I would recommend for fans. The quality of the product was good. Good price for this product."
3,The Hardy Boys episodes were better...,"As with the first season, the Hardy Boys episodes were better than the Nancy Drew ones (granted, this may be because I know the Nancy Drew books better and so departures from the Hardy Boys books didn't bother me as much).I thought it quite bizarre that Season 2 introduced Ned Nickerson as a whole new character, played by a different actor (Rick Springfield, which at least made it enjoyable to watch him) than the Ned in the first season, with no mention of the contradiction. Nancy continues to be pushy and unpleasant; but even that is better than what happens when Janet Louise Johnson takes over the role and turns Nancy into a useless, helpless cipher.I wish that someone would do a decent job of filming the Nancy Drew books. So far, I haven't come across any movies or tv shows that do her justice."
5,great tv series,I have really enjoyed season 2. The packaging was very well done and the picture and sound quality were excellent for an older tv show. Now bring on season 3.
3,The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries: season two,"Watched these episodes as a kid, while watching them many happy memories came flooding back. Cheesy now but still entertaining."
5,Just the Facts in Emergency Medicine,"I am currently prepping for the ConCert exam and am trying to streamline my studies. I am also answering lots of questions from various sources. Just the Facts seems to cover all the important points (i.e., has the answers to most of the questions), without bogging you down. It would not be a good resource for someone just starting to learn EM, but is a great resource for those who just need a review."
3,"Nice carseat, but......","I recently bought 2 of these carseats, but was surprised to see that the back does NOT disconnect from the seat. I purchased these because I thought the back would be a nice option for long trips, but could detach the back and use just the base for everyday. Not so. It doesn't disconnect (like the Graco brand).Has a nice option to raise & lower the back to adjust the the height of your child. Nice material, moving armrests, 2 drink holders, etc.Just didn't work for me."
2,Need help contacting company??,"i just pulled the shell off to wash for the first time and the foam underneath is broken!! The side head rest piece, just fell off!! Is this normal. I may have had the seat a year, but used in my second car. As I said just washing it for the first time!!! I called comfort first after googling the compass name and they were not helpful!! I did not expect this from a seat I thorouly investigated!! NOT HAPPY. HELP??thanks,Heather"
5,Excellent Product...Top of the Line,"Couldn't be happier with this booster seat. It is the Cadillac of booster seats. We feel very secure putting our children in these.If you're struggling to lose the Britax car seat security like we were, rest assured you have found a suitable replacement."
5,Love love love this seat,"I bought two seats like this for my two kids (at the time ages were 3.5 and 5) and I love them. What's great is that the base for these is a bit smaller than typical booster seats, which has made them easier to strap into the 3rd row of my Honda Pilot, which does not accomodate regular booster seats nearly as well. These are very comfy and the covers remove easily to throw into the washer and dryer for cleaning. I also love that I can easily fold them in half and put them behind the back seats of my Pilot for storage when I don't need them. I think my only complaint would be I'd love for the cupholders to remove so I could easily clean them. Maybe they do...but I've not figured out how yet!"
5,Great booster,"Great booster seat. My son loves it. We plan on buying another one for our daughter who is very jealous after seeing this one. Easy to use. There is a lot of padding and when my son fell asleep in the car today his head did not flop forward, he seemed very comfortable. The shoulder strap fits great and it is in the right place with the guide so it can not slip off."
2,ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS PROBLEM???,"I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SEAT, EXCEPT THAT I FIND THE SHOULDER STRAP DOESNT GO SQUARELY ON MY SON'S SHOULDER BLADE, IT SOMETIMES GOES DOWN BY HIS UPPER ARM BECAUSE HE LEANS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CAR TO SEE OUT THE FRONT WINDOW. ALSO, IS THE BACK SEAT BELT SUPPOSED TO CLICK & LOCK WHEN YOU PUT THE CHILD IN, OR ONLY WHEN GOD FORBID YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT OR STOP SHORT? OTHER THAN THAT, I REALLY LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE, ITS QUITE LIGHT, VERY COMFORTABLE & SEEMS PRETTY SAFE."
4,Pediatric Physical Therapy,"An excellent reference book for physical therapists beginning to practice in the area of pediatrics. Good comprehensive general information on a variety of pediatric disabilities and disorders, as well as available orthotics. Good reviews of current assessment tests used, including information on interpretation, reliability and validity. Not recommended for the physical therapist who already has expertise in the pediatric field, content appears to be geared for those just entering the specialty field."
1,Garbage!,"Jan Williams, Dean of the Business School at UTK, is known for neither his creativity or knowledge. This book demonstrates that his reputation is well deserved."
4,"Intriguing book, not as good as book on Garfield..","I started reading Kenneth Ackerman's take on the notorious Boss Tweed after reading his superb book on James Garfield. Ackerman still shows a knack for bringing us back in time and we begin to understand the major personalities. Boss Tweed was a complex man, and at times I felt cheering for him to beat his eniemies who really seem worse than him. Nobody in this book has pure motives. The NY Times wanted fame and hated the Irish. Nast also hated the Irish and saw bringing down Tweed as a moral crusade, facts be damned. Tilden is seen as a two-faced wimpy man who did want reform but wanted to destroy Tweed more. Tweed himself was a thief but he did give back to the city he stole from, and he was the only major player in ""The Ring"" to have had major jail time. His associates in crime got off scot-free mainly due to a stubborn wish to damn Tweed."
4,Good read on corruption,"While I did enjoy this book it could have provided a bit more info on the depth of the corruption at this period. It would appear that the ""reformers"" were equally immoral, if not corrupt. Why was Tweed singled out. You come to almost feel sorry for him, almost. Possibly to much information is unknowable. But good read and will leave the reader asking questions and looking for more.In a good way."
4,Excellent Biography,"This is an excellent biography. Well researched and noted, and very readable. It was as enjoyable as reading a novel. William Tweed is a very interesting American icon of graft and criminal activity, but Ackerman gives his life a very balanced review. He shows all of Tweed's crimes, but also shows why he, and other men like him, were also liked very much by his constituents. Tweed was definitely the model for all the 20th century city political bosses. Book is well worth your time, especially if you are intersted in the hisotry of America and New York."
4,BOSS TWEED: The Corrupt Pol who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York,"This is a well written and entertaining book that brings a bygone era back to life. New Yorkers, or people who are familiar with the NYC area, will find it particularly interesting. The only thing missing was insight into what motivated Tweed to embark and remain on the corrupt path he took in life. Despite the author's painstaking and well documented research, Tweed comes across as a somewhat disconnected and two dimensional figure."
5,Looking Forward to Another Good Book by Ackerman,"I have been looking forward to a new book by Ken Ackerman since reading Dark Horse, his book about President Garfield. Ackerman's Dark Horse was a wonderfully engaging and educational book, and I am sure the same is true of his latest work on Boss Tweed. Politics can be a dirty profession, and Boss Tweed was a master of his trade. Most readers will be shocked at how brazen he was, and surprised at how timid modern day politics seems when compared to Tweed and his contemporaries. I am confident that Ackerman will give us a good look at one of the more interesting figures in New York history.I've been looking, but haven't seen this a local bookstore yet. I can't wait for it to show up."
1,Recieved wrong Item,"I placed my order with True Value and it took 13 days for delivery of a wrong, lesser-priced item. My email (forwarded by Amazon) was answered promptly with a promise to email me a prepaid, return shipping label for a full refund. 20 days later, I emailed True Value a second time, resulting in a prompt email of the promised return label. Six days after FedEx delivered the return, my account was credited. Elapsed time ... 48 days."
3,Marathon Of Steam 3,"It Has 3 Early Videotapes In One Filmed By Greg Scholl Video Productions Between 1986 & 1988. The Format Of The Tape Is The Same Version Like The ""Plow Extras"" Dvd. You Know, The Sounds & Narration Are Separated? Anyway ""BCR Steam With 2860 & 3716"" Only Has The Narration At The Beginning & At The End. Second One & Short: ""819 Arkansas Steam"" Only Tape Shot In 1988 & It Follows The Now-Scrapped Locomotive From Pine Bluff(819's Home & Birthplace)To Fordyce AR & Back. And The Last One ""NKP 765 Autumn Spectacular"" (Greg Re-Edited This One On Dvd In Time For His 25th Anniversary in 2009, So DON'T ASK GREG ABOUT 765!!!), Has The Bill Warrick Films At The Start. Strangely Unlike Vol. 1 & 2, It Doesn't Have The Credits For Each Tape. Overall, Go Down To Greg Scholl's Memory Lane & By This Tape Along With ""Plow Extras"" NOW!!!!"
5,Great package kit,"Awesome stuff. Just be forewarned - the master kit DOES NOT come with the bushings for the rear control arm. Other than that, the suspension on my IROC is waaaaaaaaaaay nicer than it was before this kit."
2,3 years no problems - then Boom.. dead,"I am now in the market for a new speaker system, my AVS500 system having just shorted out. This is a decent, and only decent 5 speaker system. it's cheap, it works well while it works, and when something stops working its trash, there are no replacements availible should the power supply or the subwoofer or satillites fail. be warned, this is not the speaker system you should expect to live longer than 3 or so years, even with gentle care, rather is a decent budget 5.1 to get you by for now.. and probably over-priced at that."
2,Good sound but they don't turn off,"When I got these home I loved the sound. Then I hit the on/off button and it killed the volume but I could still hear white sound coming out of the speakers. So I tried contacting the company to no avail. I took them back to the retailer thinking they were faulty and got another pair. But they too did the same thing. It's a design flaw. As soon as you plug the wall adapter in you hear a ""HISS"" coming from them even before you turn them on! I returned them for another companies speakers that will turn off. I wonder how much energy they use if you keep them plugged in all day.I guess the only way to stop it is to constantly unplug them..."
2,HUH??? What????,"Altec-Lansing has some great computer speaker set-ups, this however isn't one of them. :( The sound is muddy as all get out. Ran Janes F-18, Nascar Racing 2002, Medal of Honor:Allied Assault on a 128 bit SB game sound card and was terrible...."
2,Good sound but they don't turn off!,"I plugged them in and listened to hours of music. They sound great. then I shut down my computer and hit the on/off switch on the speakers but they didn't turn off. The volume turned off but there was still that white sound (hissing) coming from the speakers. I returned them thinking they were faulty but the same thing happened to the second set. It's a design flaw. You plug the wall adapter into the subwoofer and you immediately hear hissing out of it and you haven't even plugged in the speaker with the on/off switch on it yet! I emailed the company and they said someone would contact me but I'm still waiting. If you live in a noisy environment these speakers will be fine. But if your room is quiet at night you'll hear the ""hiss"" coming from them when they're turned off."
2,i've got it and this is it...,"So:1 point+ for design1 point- for ""no headphones jack"" :)1 point- for subwoofer volume (it could be placed anywhere else but not on the subwoofer - if you name that a woofwer- i mean it is too far ... but some moovments improove your body structure:))And finally the sound....you see a...a...a...desktop speakers low price bla bla not for living-room that is sure Thanks"
5,Great fit,True husky quality! These covers fit well and are extremely durable. I wouldn panel a space shuttle with these covers
2,Floor Mats,very poor fit Did not lay flat by the door sill and I hit the mat with my foot every time I got in.. I purchased Weathertech which fit great.
5,AWESOME FLOOR MATS,"If you're looking for floor mats that actually do what they are suppose to do - leave the carpets underneath looking brand new - then this is the product. Raised edges on all sides (approx. 1/2"") traps water & dirt/sand. Heavy duty - but not necessarily industrial looking. The fit/fitment is perfect. This is the second set of Husky floor liners. I have a set in my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 and the carpets beneath look like they came from the factory (10 years ago)! Highly recommend this product."
1,Do not buy. Terrible experience.,"Take my warning: stay away from this product, as well as the AW920 speaker.The problem was that we were getting very loud interference intermittently on our speaker and it would only go away if you powered off the hub and powered it back on. Major hassle for us; startling noise for our backyard guests. I called the manufacturer, Thomson Inc, to find out why this was happening, but there's ABSOLUTELY NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT available.Instead, I got a non-responsive agent telling me nothing more than to send it in under the warranty for replacement. I then asked to speak to a manager because I was very unhappy with the customer service, and she told me that there was no one else I could speak to. Unbelievable.Do not buy - look elsewhere."
4,"Works perfectly, no problems at all","I got this to use with my Wireless Digital Headset. It hooked up perfectly and I've had no problems at all. I like that I don't have to tune in to it, my headset picks it up automatically. The sound it's sending to my headset is crystal clear. The only reason I give this 4 out of 5 stars is that I'm not happy that the receiver is separate from the headset."
5,A Masterpiece!,"This is Pacino's first movie and he scores a knockout his first time out. This film was made when hollywood still invested it's time and money in acting and true film making instead of today's tabloid celebrity pretty faces and CGI. Kitty Winn does an outstanding job and you feel as though you are watching a documentary about heroin addicts because her portrayal and performance is so spot on and genuine. This is what film making is about. It tells a story in a gritty and honest fashion and the characters pull you in. You will not see films made like this today, so do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this DVD."
2,"Great acting debut by Al Pacino, but...","Plot of this movie is kind of a downer, and it's outdated too. If you like Al Pacino, I suppose it is a must see, but otherwise, I would not bother."
3,Panic in Needle Park,"So sad the beginning was the end and the end was the beginning in this movie,and so real. Still loved the very young Al Pacino."
3,Pacino Can't Save a Tired Script,"I can't help but compare this film to Drugstore Cowboy, another drama detailing the life of heroin users. The comparison does not favor Panic. While Drugstore Cowboy feels like a story written by someone who really knows what it's like to be a junkie (it was), this tale feels like it was written by an intellectual who had never touched smack but thought it would be cool to write a story about strung-out people. The whole thing feels affected, stale, acted out. You can't help but love Al Pacino, overacting in an endearing way in the earliest days of his career. And Kitty Winn, the actress who plays Pacino's partner in crime here, is cute and charming in a Margot Kidder/Karen Allen kind of way. But actors' charms aside, the film is bland and sterile. Skip this and go watch Drugstore Cowboy, which will make you feel like you are really inside the world of a group of heroin users."
4,Cracked denture,Crack fixed for a couple of days then split open again. Problem probably is the crack goes across 3/4 of the upper denture and there is a lot of play when biting with the front teeth.
2,Hard to work with,This product is hard to work with. If you need to fix a broken denture I would recommend taking it to someone that makes dentures. They can do a much better job.
1,unsure,Can't give a great review because this didn't seem to work properly. I wasn't the one that did the repair so I'm not sure if the instructions were followed correctly.
4,IT WORKS!!!,"D.O.C. Denture Repair Kit is a fantastic product. It really works. And, it's so easy to use. Only one hint: Use it sparingly to start. I made the mistake of applying too much product and because it dries so quickly, it was difficult to remove the extra product. Be ready to apply the mixture as soon as it is mixed. Aside from the above, it really worked!!"
5,Great Music,"I purchased this CD after listening to ""Crystal Blue Persusion"" on the local smooth jazz station. Let me say this, buy it!! you'll hear smooth vocals, awesome rolling bass and good hard drumming. it is a can't miss Cd."
3,"Not bad, some fitment issues","Pros:* Inexpensive* Better low-end power* Better high-end power* o2 Sensor bung and bolt-in designCons:* Cheap design means some manufacturing defects* Poor fitment near parking brake hardware* EGR bung was incorrect for my truck* Included gaskets are cheap/poor qualityI only know of one other header that fits the Isuzu 4cylinder trucks, and this one is much less expensive. Unfortunately, the fitment isn't very good. If you have the time and know how to modify the header and your truck, it works fine. I had to bend the stud mounted to my frame where the parking brake cable pivots, as well as modify the header for my EGR bung. The gaskets are of poor quality, and the shipping paint on the header burns off upon start-up and leaves a nasty residue (the paperwork notes it is for shipping purposes only). Overall performance with the header installed is better, so for the price it was worth doing since my stock manifold was cracked anyway."
4,Remarkable Sats and Sub,"No complaints here. Have had these for a few months and I am always amazed at how good they sound for their size and price (especially when playing regular 16 bit stereo cds). Sometimes I often forget that they are just simple sats and sub and I think I'm listening to a mid-priced portable table top bedroom or home stereo shelf unit. Albeit these speakers are not for those seeking the ultimate in audiophile perfection. However, you got to remember your using this for a computer set up and not for a full blown hdtv widescreen movie extravaganza in 5.1 or6.1 or 10.1 (you get the picture without any pun)! Altec Lansing so far has me sold on these. Now, they've only wet my aural appetite to see (or hear) what their higher priced and more elaborate set ups are like..."
4,Great speakers for the price!,"I bought these to view my dvd's on the computer. My computer is in a small room, so this system is perfect! They were a snap to set up, a 10 year old could do it. I'm sure there are better systems out there, but not at this price! I recommend!"
2,Shot in less than six months,"OK, these are cheap good sounding speakers.But less than six months into my purchase, one of the speakers has a short.So, it's a total loss.Be careful -- you get what you pay for."
4,"great for the price, but watch out!","Not full range, but rich in the range it has, this system is damn good for the money. My only advice is to watch out, as one short tumble of the right speaker killed my whole system. since i got it for 40 bucks and used it a year, it's okay, but wanna warn others. Also, beware of 5 piece gaming system by AL in same price range, horrible!! couldn't believe it was the same manufacuterer. REPEAT this product good buy but fragile, 5 piece system in this price range sucks."
5,"I love ""ALTEC ALNSING""","1. Delivers high quality audio for music, gaming, MP3, home entertainment and PCs.2. Powered subwoofer adds bass for low frequency realism.3. Patented EQ circuitry provides dynamic bass response.Cheap, just good for everyone!!!"
4,Get the audio as well,"This book is also put out with a audio companion. Go back and search for that title. Make sure you get that edition, not just the book. Furthermore, there is a later edition of the book/audio combination that came out in January of 1995. Ms. Watts has been around the Greek language and its instruction for quite awhile under different publishing houses and has consistenly produced fine instructional material. The Colloquial series and the Greek in Three Months by Hugo series are both done by Ms. Watts. If you can, go to your local bookstore and compare the Colloquial, the Greek in Three Months and the Teach Yourself Series. While each is fairly comprehensive, one may be more suited to your liking. Whatever you do, always get the audio companion to the book."
5,Excellent read,"I have all of Alan's books and I recommend this one the most. It is an excellent all around guide that includes much of the information found in his other books. Enjoyable to read with his sense of humor and very informative. I believe I could have designed my current car build using only this book even though I have more than a dozen other technical books on chassis design, suspension design, and other aspects of car building, modifying, and tuning. Highly recommended."
3,Rustic and verbose,"This book creates the sensation that you have sat down at a British pub and your new mate started this whole business of ""rally car racing"" and he's retired so he wants to tell you his whole story now that he's got a firm grip on your ear. It certainly is folksy, charming and wordy, but if you don't mind reading endless, sort of amusing, anecdotes, letting you in on the real inside dope of who invented (and crashed) what, you may eventually get to something about building or modifying a car."
4,Handbook of Applied Photometry,Handbook of Applied Photometry has a wealth of knowledge that can only be presented and collated by some one who has worked in the calibration field in photometry and radiometry. I do believe some of the images have been presented poorly and should be of photo quailty. Other than that it is still a pretty good book.
2,Producto Enviado No Corresponde Con El Solicitado,"El Producto Solicitado no fue el que se me envio, yo solicite el HD de 80Gb y me enviaron el de 60Gb. Ademas me hicieron pagar los portes y la aduana cuando figuraba como incluido en el precio."
5,Great Book,"I just wanted to add that this is a great book. I hope Kathryn Smith continues and writes about the other three brothers. I love it when an author has books that are a ""family"" series. I don't want to say good-bye to Blythe/Devlin just yet."
2,I am obviously in the minority...,"This book did not impress me. The author really wanted us to know that this heroine was tall and big. She kept referring to her as this gargantuan beast. She towers over most men and is stronger than most men. I mean, by the time I'm done reading this thing, I'm imagining someone from the WWF.And the hero in this book keeps referring to her as an Amazon. I'm sorry, but even if you're tall, no one wants to be called an Amazon! I know the guy was taller and bigger, but I just felt like it was two men falling in love (not that there's anything wrong with that). It just wasn't my idea of an ideal romance novel.I don't think I'll be picking up anything else by this author. Obviously others disagree and really liked this book. I guess to each his own."
5,Success the Glen Bland way,"My father gave me this book back in the 70's but I didn't really read it until the 80's when as a Realtor, goal setting became much more important. It's not the greatest title but what a great, easy to follow, simple to read yet can make the hair on the back of your neck stand up and pay attention book. In the 90's, my book had definitely seen better days, since I use it every year right before I set my yearly goals. When I tried to order the book, it was quite hard to find. I recently attended a ""Goddess Retreat"" where we have a ""my favorite book exchange"". Knowing that most likely no one else had ever read this book, I knew this is the one I had to bring, no matter how hard it was going to be to find. Lo and behold, it's been re-printed! If you're looking for a motivating, balanced, goal setting and planning book designed for goals and plans for your entire life, I highly recommend this book."
1,Whatever,"This is really a handbook for how to be a good Christian and get rich. If that's what you're looking for, here's your book.If what you want is good, practical, scientifically-rooted tools for improving your life, look elsewhere."
4,Good Product,It's exactly what is states to be. It's an affordable boot that does the job. I stretched it over the inner portion of the rear axle to save time and cost involved with disassembling the outer CV joint. It's pliable enough to stretch and ended up working great. No complaints.
5,Strongly recommended!,"This box set contains the first sixteen episodes of the amazing TV series, Fullmetal Alchemist. DVD extras(production galleries, trailers, L'Arc~en~Ciel's Ready Steady Go music video, episode 1 of Spiral TV series) and booklets are included. The four discs are stored in a elegant shiny, silver cardboard box."
5,A Must Buy for Fullmetal Fans,I love this Box Set and can not wait for the next one. If you own all the dvd already then don't buy but if you don't then this is a must buy.
5,Superb series,"Fullmetal Alchemist, in my opinion, is one of the best series out there. The anime is funny, moving and engaging. I would recommend this series to anyone and I have. It's fantastic. Unfortunately I bought this before the Season 1 boxset came out, so it's a bit annoying. For those considering this purchase, it seems to be a better value to buy the entire season boxset instead of part 1 and part 2 separately. It does seem pricy but it's definitely worth the money. Shop around for the best deals, this dvd should be in everyone's collection."
1,Clunky and Smoked,"I thought this would be a good choice for our library, but it didn't work for us. Unfortunately, the lamp is much larger than it appears in the pictures and not very elegant in design. (My husband and I both thought it was kind of horsey.) We expected honey brass to be brushed brass but it turns out it's a black smoked finish overlayed on the brass. All we could think of is that it looked like the lamp had been in a fire. Aesthetically, it didn't work for us. Ott lamps continue to receive very high praise from multiple members in my knittng/needlework group so I'm going to look for another style that's less clunky."
2,HORSE CRAZY IN TENNESSEE,"This read-in-one sitting book by the author of MISTY OF CHINCOTEAGUE is presented in both diary format (first person) and standard narrative form (third person). You will be kept on your toes as chapters alternate in style, even switching back and forth in the same chapter. But this lightweight tale introduces readers to the world of mules--their history and unappreciated value. Molly (aged 10-13) acquires a young mule as a suprise, thanks to her father's wise faith in a lean, older mare. Even the local bully grows up to respect both girl and mule. This gently-paced story praises human caring for animals and their loyal service to man. A simple storyline which will appeal to pre teen girls are horse crazy."
3,I was disappointed,"Great idea. Wonderful windows and views. My issue is the slide was horrible and construction pitful. I could barely move the piece that slides and it bent and cracked right away. Basically I had to break the unit, shave parts, reglue. Now it works great. Basically good unit with very poor construction quality."
4,Hidden Gem!,"This was a very fun little read. If you love Doctor Who and enjoy the 1st Doctor and his companions you will enjoy this!I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for, this is not meant to be fine literature, but FUN DOCTOR WHO! It has succeeded at this in my opinion.I suggest reading this and then when the missing episode finally gets released you can see what it looked like on screen! The recovery of the missing episode meant that we have seen the aliens for the first time since the original broadcast, you can find screen caps online if you want to first."
2,A story that doesn't stand the test of time,"William Emms adapts his own script in this novelisation.The fundamental message of this story is that ""beauty is only skin deep"". The TARDIS arrives on an unnamed planet, where they have an odd encounter with a robot, named by Vicki as a Chumbly, before being captured by abgroup oif female warriors known as the Drahvins.The Drahvins claim that the planet will self-destruct in a few days time, and seek the assistance of the TARDIS crew in defeating another downed spacecarft of aliens, the Rills, who have managed to repair their ship. They prompt the travelklers by holding one of them hostage against the success of the mission.While casting good-looking women as villains may have not been very copmmon in 1965, it is so old hat by now that what may have been surprises when the show was broadcast will surprise no one these days.This is not greatly assisted by William Emms uninspiring adaptation."
2,Save your money!!,"This book was painfully awful. I have read several of Zane's books in the past, none are what I would call literary masterpieces, but they are entertaining nonetheless. This book was not even up to Zane's standards! It was slow from beginning to end, with idiotic plots and subplots. I won't spoil it, but the surprises at the end are not even surprises. The only real situations were that of Janessa and D'vonte. I could relate to their drama. But Temptest and Geran...get a life and give me a break. I would not recommend this book to anyone!"
4,Remarks,"The book was interesting. However, I felt that the plot could have been a bit more sexual like the others. Overall, the story was catching."
3,OK,"The main reason that I didn't like this book was because, I'm so used to Zane's exotic tales, and I was definetely expecting a erotic tale, that isn't the case here in this book. It's a good love story but nothing else. Even the love story was just O.K."
3,Ok with it,"This book was ok it didnt have any drama in it and it seemed to have no action , this book was ok , If your in to roamance and that only then this is a good book for you."
1,Unrealistic,"After reading other Zane books, this one was truly the worst. Not because of the lack of sex, but the story was so predictable and unbelievable. You have the ""hoochie"" hooking up with the ""playa"" and the ""good girl"" lands the ""catch"" who, by the way, just happens to be a millionaire. So everyone lives happily ever after. Maybe in a perfect world. As soon as she introduced the little teenager who was pregnant, I knew what was gonna happen with that story. It seems like I read this story once before. Very boring read! Do waste your money, borrow it from someone if you just have to read it!"
4,A Must read,"I really enjoyed this latest Zane project. This is my favorite Zane book that I've read so far. Yes, it is different from her other books, but this goes to show you that Zane is capable of writing in many different forms. Keep up the good work Zane! And I'm looking forward to reading more of your work."
1,WHO WROTE THIS BOOK ? A 2-YEAR OLD?,"THIS BOOKS DOESN'T DESERVE ANY STARS, BUT SINCE IT DEFAULTS TO AT LEAST ONE, I HAVE TO INDICATE 1.I happened to purchase this book for some in-flight/vacation relaxation entertainment. What a waste. I'd like to return it to the bookstore for a full return. I was amazed at this author's juvenile style of writing and description lacking characters. This was one of the worst books that I have ever read (read it while delayed in an airport for several hours)!! I have not read any of her other books and based on this TRASH, I don't plan to read any others. Some of the characters and stories in the books were simply unbelievable (midgets/coat hanger abortion in the 90's) cmon!!!My suggestion to those who are entertaining the idea of purchasing this book, DON'T!"
4,a let down,"I have read all of Zane's books. I could not wait to read the heatseekers. Granted, it is a good fiction read. However, it is not of the calibur that I have come to expect from Zane. All of her other books have been edgier and funnier."
3,My Least Favorite,"I liked this book because it's a Zane novel, but I must admit its one of my least favorite Zane books. It was very traditional in the ""boy meets girl"" kinda way. By the title I thought I would be blown away, but its a pretty ordinary tale. It makes a great read if you have nothing else to do and want a book to read."
4,I liked it!,"No, it wasn't ""typical"" Zane in that it wasn't stock fill of sex, but there was enough sex for those who are looking for that, and also had romance, developed relationships, and a sustained plot.How can you complain when you can get all of that?I think this is Zane's best book, with MAYBE the exception of Addicted.Maybe not as freaky as some of her other books, but a really good story."
4,Funny in a sense,"I think that Zane did a good job with Heath Seekers, however the story was kinda of predictable. I don't understand all of the 1* and 2*, it wasn't that bad. It was a different style for Zane, it wasn't a erotica story in the sense that it lack all of the intricate sex details the previous stories had. I would have to say that Addicated was intoxicating, I couldn't get enough. But Heat Seekers was funny because of the midgets scenes. But Zane a guess the rest of your readers don't appreciate a clean story of a decent relationship between two adults, so give them what that want. SEX, SEX, SEX, LIES, DECEPTION, with twist and turns and then a resoultion. But read it for yourself.Keep up the good work Zane and be blessed."
3,Not what I had expected,"This book was not what I expected if you went by the title or the cover sheet... It was an all right book, but lacks something as well as info about the character, specially their ages. The story line was very basic and a typical one as well and to far fetch in certain areas. However, in all it did have it is funny moments and some realism also that is going on in the dating world today. It was a good read but not one I would recommend to anyone."
2,NOT TRUE TO FORM,I read Addicted and loved it. I had everyone in my office reading the book. It was one of the best books I have read in years. I was so excited when this book came out that myself and several of my co-workers brought the book right away. We read it and we all were thoroughly disappointed. It was a cross between a B movie and a bad romance novel. I think the erotica and unexpected ending was my attraction to Addicted but this paled in comparison. I had a hard time finishing it and when I did my reaction was WHATEVER!! Please Zane go back to your old format that's what readers loved about you.
2,Below Average Seekers,"I definitely felt like a below average reader, spending my time reading this book. At first the book started out pretty interesting with Tempest descriptions of previous relationships with losers. After that the book went down hill. Not only was the book very predictable, but also like a children fairytale. I do believe in happy endings, but lets get real..."
4,Yes There Is Hope For Love,"I thought the book was very good. It helped you to remember that true love & friendship come first, money, sex, etc, could wait if you really loved someone."
3,Not what I expected,"When I saw the title ""The Heat Seekers"" under Zane, I thought that there would be more scenes of sex and passion. Instead, there was just stories of how Janessa and Tempest are doing with their newfound loves and so forth. Then I became confused after the chapter of three months later, it showed that Tempest and Geren spent Christmas together, Janessa became pregnant, Geren proposed, and on their wedding night, Janessa gave birth. Tempest has stated that now even a year ago she had no one, and now she's getting married. The book stated that Janessa didn't find out that she was pregnant until later in the book. That's what confused me the most. Other than that, the book was alright. I finished it in three days, and that's beause I wanted to know what ""all of the secrets"" were. Zane has had much better books."
2,TOTALLY MISLEADING TITLE,"I guess when I picked this booked up (and paid full price for it) that I was looking for total erotic and a little more flavor. I was sorely disappointed!! Throughout the book, I kept wondering, ""When will I get to the good part? Where's the vivid ... scenes?? Where's the peak story line?"" Didn't happen!!Zane's faceless characters lacked depth. The first chapter of the book was somewhat juicy, but then ""Tempest"" did a personality 360. I had to wonder if I was still reading about the same character. Someone needs to tell Zane that readers are not picking up her latest effort to read about self-proclaimed celibacy. Geez!!The entire book read like amateur writing. There wasn't even a story line. What a flop!... Better luck next time..."
2,Disappointment,"I anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book after reading the other Zane novels. This novel was found to be a very big disappointment. This book did not live up to the name that Zane has made for herself. The story line was very easy to see through and rather boring. It lacked the passion and intense story line that this author has produced in the pass. I know that there will be ups and down, but this was a big downer! And it lacked quality, in other words in was way too GHETTO! I believe the infamous Zane got over on us on this one."
2,Extremely Dissapointed!,"I am a very big fan of Zane, but OH MY GOODNESS, I think someone else wrote this book for her! Nothing in it was like her previous works. I eagerly awaited the release of this book and even had it on order here at Amazon before it was released... IT [DISAPPOINTED]!! I absolutely never abandon a book because I always need closure, but I couldn't even finish it! And can someone please explain to me my girl ZANE's obsession with ""midgets?!"" I was very suprised to find that some readers gave this book 4 and 5 stars. The ""secrets"" that were ""revealed"" regarding Tempest and Darren... BORING! I read Zane's other books in 2 days or less... It took me 2 weeks to read Heat Seekers and I still didn't finish it. Every time I put it down it was too hard to pick back up. I'm looking forward to the next Zane novel because I believe she will make a come back! There's nowhere to go from Heat Seekers but up!"
2,Still Seeking the Heat,"I have read all of Zane's book and I must say Zane is a captivating author. From the begining of the book till the end, she will have you at the edge of your seat. I consider her one of the greatest authors of this century. She is graphical and helps a woman discover what is missing in a woman's sex life. She makes the reader feel passion and the excitement when reading.However, HEATSEEKERS was very disappointing. It lacked Passion, drama, excitement, life, thrill, and all the other elements that make her books great. I was very suprised at Zane because her books are always very good. Hopefully the next book would make up for this one."
2,Zane is soooo....,"Weak as a writer. The Heatseekers had the potential to be a great book with a decent story line but, Zane does not possess enough talent to pull it off. The entire time I was reading this material I prayed that it would come to an end. Her writing is cliche at best and she offers no good use of imagery. I predicted the end just by reading the liner notes on the inside flap. I give this book two stars because I was able to read it from cover to cover without being totally bored to death."
2,"Wait a minute, I read this before!!","I know I read this before in my dreams or perhaps in my former life. This was all too predictable. I felt no compassion here. the story was preachy and not down to earth. geren was a character from the writers dreams, this black young millionaire had everyhing going for himself, i often wondered what he saw in tempest, didnt he say she had on a cheap black suit at first? and they met in a club of all places. anyway she has this gratifying job based on her past experiences and he is even too rich to pass for a broker. can i switch lives with these 2? janessa living in the projects with her brother who farts more than anything else, even has farting friends?? Janessa never tried to move out of her parents home in the projects even after applying to college. this SH!@#! is not REAL!! dvonte was the realest character and he sucked! To all my fellow Zane readers you know what applies here, say it with me, SHAME ON IT ALL!!!"
3,Not a Good Representation of Zane! Not at all!!,"Don't hold this book against Zane!!!This was a weak write for her. I think she was trying to break out of her genre! I don't know. But this book was so boring. The story was too cute. I was happy in the end. But it wasn't what I thought a book by Zane, and called the Heat Seekers would be about. It could be again because I compared everything to her first great write...Addicted. But anyway, this was more mainstream, more like everybody else! Not Zane."
3,just so so for Ms. Zane,Zane is all of that NORMALLY! But this was just so so! It was okay. The ending was pretty predictable! But I'll stick with my girl.
2,IS THIS REALLY ZANE??!!!!!??,"I have all of Zane's books, and I love every one of them, so you could imagine how I felt when I purchased this one. I was in the middle of reading another novel and I put it down just to get into this book. I was very excited because I knew it would be off the hook!!! I'm sorry to say it's not. It is terribly boring!!! It does not even seem like she wrote the book. Her unique style and humor is not even there. What happened!!?? I would'nt waste my money or time on this one."
3,Good love story,"This book is very different from Addicted, much more realistic up to a point. It's a classic love story w/some twists and turns to keep it interesting. Worth the read"
3,NOT THAT BAD,"FIRST OFF THE BOOK IS NOT THAT BAD.AFTER READING SHAME ON IT ALL ANDADDICTED MISS ZANE DID FALL ALITTLE SHORTBUT NOT TOO SHORT, THIS BOOK IS ABOUT 2 SETOF FRIENDS WHO MEET AT A CLUB. THE FIRST SETOF FRIENDS IS GEREN AND DEVONTE. GEREN IS THE KINDOF MAN WHO IS WAITING FOR THE RIGHT WOMAN, WHILEHIS FRIEND IS THE TOTALLY OPPOSITE. AND THE OTHER SETOF FRIENDS IS TEMPEST AND JANESSA. TEMPEST IS JUST LIKE GERENSHE IS WAITNG FOR THE RIGHT MAN AND HER FRIEND IS SOMEWHATOF A HOOCHIE MOMMA. GEREN HOOKS UP WITH TEMPEST THEY FALL IN LOVE AND A LOT OF SECRETS COME OUT TO TEST THEIR LOVE AND JANESSAAND DEVONTE HOOK UP AND ALL THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON IS PURE SEX UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS AND CHANGES ALL OF THAT DEVONTE NOT ONLY DOES NOT WANT TO SEE HER BUT HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH HIS BEST FRIEND GEREN BREAKS UP I THINK THE BOOK COULD HAVE ENDED MUCH BETTER BUT OVER ALL IT IS NOT THAT BAD."
4,Too good to be true,"This book started off slow, but it picked up later. I enjoyed reading this Geren was too good to be true."
3,I'M STILL SEEKING!!!,"OK.... The fisrt book I read by Zane was ""SEX CHRONICLES"" so when a friend suggested I read this one, I took one look at the title and SNATCHED it from her. Then I read it, and I wanted to SLAP her with it! Did Zane really write this one. DON""T GET ME WRONG this book is funny as hell. I was laughing out loud at some of it. But it just doesn't have that ZANE effect that i expected. Toward the end I just got even more discouraged, the book became predictable. I gave it 3 stars because IT WAS FUNNY. Had she written the same book with a little more sex appeal i'm sure I would have loved it!"
2,Hated It!!!,"Come on this book sucked with a capital S! After reading ""Addicted"" which is my favorite book, PERIOD, and Shame on it all and Sex Chronicles this book was BOO-BOO and Pure Garbage and it all is because she strayed from her erotic story telling to tell a very cute and perfect love story, Please save it cause I don't want to hear it. This book is definately for Lovers Only!Be Warned this is NOTHING like ""ADDICTED"" if that is what you are looking for!"
2,There was no heat!,"When I read Addicted, I was like ""I'm reading all of her books."" Shame on it all didn't measure up to Addicted but I also read this one. To me it doesn't have enough imagination. Not enough drama."
1,typical zane...,"Attempting to understand the popularity of someone is a daunting task when it comes to Zane. Her ridiculous tales, lackluster imagery, and corny dialogue amount to a huge waste of time. If you're interested in reading something quality, check out momowilly's newest book exclusively at lulu.com."
3,Not the Same Zane,I am not sure what to say about Heat Seekers.After having read it I can agree with some of the reader.This is not one of Zane's best work. While I did enjoy this story I too was disappointed. Having read her work I would not have know this was Zane the author I know.The characters did not flow well for me and I am not quite sure what was missing other than knowing this was not the fast pace moving story I am use to with Zane.Zane's style of reading can me a little to explicit for some but the stories are usually great.I guess all of her work can not be 5* reads. I have one other story to read and I will have read all of her work. Even though this was not her best it was not bad.Could it the the publishers not letting her write what she does best?An okay read but not one of her best.Hey having said all of this I will be waiting for her next book.
2,where's the heat?,"I have read a few of Zane's books, and they have all left me disappointed. However, at least in the newest one, Skyscrapers, the plot wasn't transparently predictable. As I read The Heat Seekers, I was waiting for something to happen that I couldn't see a mile away. Nothing ever did. I could have been able to overlook that if there had been a little HEAT in the book. For a ""sexy"" novel, it was lukewarm at best. Some reviewers say this is because it was a romance novel. The romance she was going for wasn't there. With romance, there should still be passion. Also, it was much too unrealistic. Geren and Tempest fell in love for no reason, and are we really supposed to believe the whole Janessa and Dvonte situation? The novel was much too bland to swallow. If you have a few hours that you really have nothing else to do with, go ahead and read this. But, if you're looking to be entertained, please pass this one by."
1,So Boring I Almost Fell Asleep!,"Wow! I'm still in shock. After reading some of Zane's other books, I thought the least I'd get from this book was reliable entertainment. I understand her not wanting to simply focus on erotica all the time, but my goodness, just because you take out all of the explicit sex scences doesn't mean you have to take out the action or the laughs too. This was one of the most boring, disappointing books I've ever read. I feel a little better knowing that I at least purchased it at a discounted price."
2,"A Task to Read, Not her best Book!!!",I read other books by Zane. I found this one to be a task to read. It was hard to keep my mind from going off to other things. The story line was weak & predictable. I only read it because I like to finish what I start...All her other books are great reads. If this is your first Zane book. You will find it interesting. But if you have read any of her other books than this one is a waste of your time.
1,Very good.,"I loved that this book was set apart from the erotic novels, yet it was still a joy to read."
1,I Returned It!!!!,"After reading Addicted and Shame on it All, I could not wait for the next book to come out by Zane. I was taking summer school college courses to advance in school and I put my school work down to read this book. At that time, Zane's book was more important than my school work. I WAS TOTALLY AND COMPLETEY DISAPPOINTED!! The book lacked everything from humor to the steamy love scenes that Zane was able to create in her previous books. The book was also just plain BORING! I continued to read it just based on the fact that I was praying that it would get better.The story line was just to fake for me. And I just could not even create an image in my mind of the characters because I got to the point that I didn't care about them after awhile.And the ending, I don't want to give it away, but come one, give me a break.....JUST TO FAKE!!!Well to make a long story short, I read the book and returned it once I finished and received a refund. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY, NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
2,DISAPPOINTED WITH HEATSEEKERS,"I am a HUGE fan of Zanes and couldn't wait to get this new book and am very, very disappointed. It's NOTHING like any of her previous books which were all very good and kept me turning the pages until I was all done but with Heatseekers, I am MAKING myself read it just to see if it gets any better, which it's not. The 2 female characters seem like little young school girls instead of grown working women. There isn't any excitement in this book. Zane, please take your time next time and give us what we know you can give which is a 5 star book."
4,I already sent in one review on the Supplier here is a review of the product.,The interface on the phone was too short to mate with the wall mouni connwction. I had to rewire the interface connection. It is a design fault.ThanksJoe Gillerman
1,Can't plug in!,"When the ad says: ""These sets are fully modular for easy installation and modification,"" this is completely untrue. This phone does not have a standard cord that plugs into any wall. You need some sort of special plate to plug it into, and there are no instructions, and no help from the seller. They just make you go through ""click this link"" relay to return the product, which they may or may not refund. Can't call because they have limited hours of customer service in EST."
1,"Looks great, died after 18 months","Great idea, bringing back the old 2554 in red. But in this case the idea doesn't work. The hook switch came apart after less than 18 months.I took it apart to see if I could fix it. I seem to have put everything back in its proper place but the spring doesn't have enough guts to return the hookswitch to the off position, the spring seat has hardly anything for the spring to catch on, and there's a little metal axle that floats in the hinge. It's supposed to stay in place by magic I suppose. Looks like someone wanted to save 25 cents.By the way, the phone fits on a standard wall-phone plate fine, by the way. There is no design flaw with the connector on this unit. A standard wall-phone plate is made for a wall phone, has two rivets sticking out, and is definitely not the same as a standard wall-mounted phone jack. The plug on the back of a standard wall phone is too short for a standard jack."
1,Phone cord wouldn't fit into body of phone,"I don't hate the phone. It was a Christmas gift from my husband. One end of the cord would not fit into the phone. No matter how we tried, we could not get the cord plugged into the phone. Therefore we cannot use the phone. I had the phone ready to return and had an RMA #. Unfortunately, my dear husband fell down the steps, hit his head on the concrete garage floor and has passed away. Returning the phone got pushed to the back burner and I guess I'll have to deal with the dealer now. I have it all packaged up ready to send too you. If you can help me, please let me know. Sincerely, ukmom@comcast.net"

2,Great for Keeping the Desk leg up,"As much as I have enjoyed previous editions of the WORLD ALMANAC, having started using the Almanac in the early 90s ( when it was truly an indispensible item), it is really a waste of paper.Whilst it is not quite yet tabloid trash, it has been so clearly surpassed by the Britannica Almanac 2005, which has so many extras, and such detailed material, that it has now become the bench mark, and all WORLD ALMANAC can do is hope to be able to fix its gross problems. You simply do not dumb down a reference work in order to get extra sales.Two stars for its ability to keep a broken table leg up."
3,lots of material,"Having written a novel about a resistant germ arising out of Asia causing a deadly pandemic, I found this book helpful in supplementing my information about the present danger: Avian flu"
4,Binonaire W15-UC Console Humidifier,"This unit is well made.User friendly, The one thing that I could sayabout this humidifier is at lower fan speeds unit is a little noisey,seams like were the water tanks meet the unit the plastic parts vibrate.So I put a small shim bewteen tank and housing of unit and this seems towork. Runs much quieter."
1,Scratch Resistant Screen Doesnt Fit ATT Tilt,I cannot recommend this product for the AT&T Tilt. The scratch resistant screen does not fit the Tilt. It is too large for the screen.
1,Garbage,"Unlike the one I saw on a blackberry that looks and works great, this one did not let me see the screen in daylight and was a mission to put on. Not worth getting, I threw it away in 1 week."
5,Shattering,"This live performance at a 1963 'Proms' Concert brought Stokowski back to London, in his home country, for an all too rare performance and made even the critics who 'sniffed' at his 'headline seeking' musicianship, sit up and notice. The conductor was 81 years old at the time of this performance and his dramatic reading of the score is a marvel. It's apparent that the soloists (Rae Woodland and Janet Baker), the combined Choruses and Orchestra knew they were participating in something special. The sense of occasion is made even more apparent when, breaking the rules at 'Prom' Concerts, the conductor was allowed to give and 'encore' of the astonishing final choral segment. There are other fine recordings of this massive work but few conductors have found many of the special touches Stokowski brings to this performance both in the meltingly beautiful quiet sections and the stirring climaxes. A treasure."
3,Downloading the Red Hat Linux ISOs for this book (-_-),"It appears that IF you buy a used copy of this book, you have to download the Red Hat ISO images in order to install the operating system, which happens to be RH version 7.2. As of the time that I post this comment on this, the ISOs can be downloaded at ftp://archive.kernel.org/redhat-archive/redhat/linux/7.2/en/ . I recommend using the Filezilla ftp client for the download. I wish the writers of the book HAD specified WHICH version to use somewhere need the beginning of the book."
2,"this is only a walk-through, not really a content based book","This is not a detailed narrative or technical language book. I was expecting a more detailed technical explaination of the topic, but instead i was faced to extensive examples that made no sense to help with learning. The book uses examples that were not well introduced, such as the network topology of the examples, server names, etc... there is no reference or apendix that remembers what is the topology of each example, so if you cannot use the book as just a reference as you lose track of what the examples are about. For this type of topic a more graphic book is important. To conclude, I believe the book has some good content but it was poorly structured and written, so it vanishes among its pages. I gave up of trying to learn from this book."
1,Is there any page without an error?????,"The book is good, but like I said before is there any page without an error????? There is no published errata for the book too!!!"
5,Great product,Exactly what I was looking for. Amazing how inexpensive a good set of chips have become in the past decade.
5,Lotsa' chips!,This set was a really good present for myself. I have poker chips out the wazoo and enough dice to play yahtzee if I wanted to. There are two sets of cards and those little blind chips in case you want to play Craps. I really didnt expect such a great quality item for the little money I spent on this. If I need another set I will definately get another of these.
5,Excellent poker chips,"After a few times runnning out of chips with a 300 chip set, I asked for Christmas for an upgrade. I recieved the chips as a gift and they are great. The chips feel very nice and were very sturdy. One of the rows has a chipped chip in it due to shipping, but since there was 999 more of them, I wasn't overly concerned.The set is heavy. Its not something easily transported, but if its in your house it's not a problem. It comes with a key to lock the set, and it has a good assortment of blind/kill buttons. The chips play well, and time will tell about their durability. The case seems a bit flimsy, but thats really the only negative of the set. For the price, a great buy!"
5,Wanderlust,"Demi also illustrated our version of ""King Midas"" -- she has an easy-to-recognize style, and her illustrations are bewitching. All that gold.This book works as a biography of Marco Polo, and also as a story of adventure. It showcases so many of the eastern cultures and customs. The last page is a brilliant map of Marco Polo's travels. Treasure this book."
5,Jeff- shown as he is:A TRUE champion,"This book depicited Jeff as how he is. A human being like everyone elso who just happens to have an amazing talent for race car driving. It has great quotes from Jeff, his father, and other race car drivers. This is the story of his life, and how he became who he is: a champion inside and out. This is a MUST for all Jeff Gordon fans."
4,Nobody's Bedtime Story,"The Sardonyx Net by Elizabeth A. Lynn is spellbinding, dramatic, action packed, and deep. Lynn is a master story teller. If you are looking for an escape to another realm that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next--you have found it. (However, if you are prone to nightmares, don't read this one in bed!) The plot is full of twists, many of them unpredictable. Human relationships, cultures, and varying views of morality are explored. The ending (while not, perhaps, the ending we would like to imagine)is ultimately satisfying."
4,"Not a gay book, but a great one!","I bought this book thinking, it has great reviews, it's science fiction, and it has gay characters; exactly what I was looking for. From the tags this book looks to be overflowing with gay storylines. Well to my disappointment, it was not. There is one sadist character that likes men(sometimes). His scenes are few and neither graphic sexually or sadistically. While I kept waiting for the all the ""gay stuff"" to appear, I genuinely got caught up in her storytelling. The author is excellent at world building as well as character developement. Interesting and well paced, this was a fun read. I enjoyed it greatly. With her talent, I'm definitely going to look into her other books."
1,Boring,"If you're a woman and fantasize about owning slaves and what it would be like to have a slave as your very own personal helicopter pilot then this book is for you. If your a man and your fantasy is to torture slaves because you're in love with your slave owning sister than this book is for you. If you're neither of the above then don't even consider this book. Although the book takes place in the future on some distant planet, there was almost nothing futuristic about this story."
4,Unmatched Performances - If Only The Sound Were Better,"This is a rather rare disc of Sviatoslov Ricther that is devoted entirely to variations by Beethoven. The Diabelli, Eroica, and opus 76 variations are played with incomparable flair, color, and emotion by this greatest of Russian pianists. Performance-wise, you will not find better versions of these pieces. However, the sound quality could be significantly better, even from a live performance, seeing as how it was taped in 1970. It's not that there is a lot of static or unclear or muffled sound, it's just that the piano sounds rather distant, which is quite odd. Nonetheless, the poor sound cannot detract from these stunning performances of Beethoven's great variations, especially the Diabellis. Get this CD if you see it in the store because it is a rarity that you most likely will not find online. Highly recommended. Very enjoyable."
5,Perfect replacement fit,I'm sometimes nervous about ordering replacement parts online because of not being the correct part and fit. No problem here. Exactly like '01 Ford 450 original. Couple of bolts (not included) to remove.
1,NOT the right part,"I ordered this item according to Amazon's parts locator. When I installed it I discovered it was not the right part. Unfortunately, my brother disposed of the box so I was not able to return it. I purchased a replacement locally. I sold it on ebay for .99 cents. $32.00 wasted on Amazon. Lesson I learned? Never buy auto parts on Amazon. Their parts locator is ""wacked"". I rated the item a one star because it was not the right part NOT because of poor quality. Rating has to do with Amazons pat locator NOT the item."
5,Fury in the Alders,"This DVD is full of top of the line grizzly bear hunts that will make it seem like you are right there with the action! This has monster bruins with pumpkin heads, dinner plate paws and skinned out over 10' on quite a few. The filming is more than 5 star beyond a reasonable doubt! This DVD is up close and personal. It REALLY makes outdoor lovers like me want to get more involved in our beautiful country and be a part of conservation and preservation of our wildlife."
2,"Interesting characters, uninteresting story.","If your looking for a good story, action or suspense skip this movie. But if you like to see quirky characters played by exellent actors well maybe. Everything about this movie was good,except the story. Being a fan of more suspense or action or even stronger characters I would watch something else."
5,Great bolt-on grille - no cutting required,"I was looking for a grille that required no cutting or drilling. This is the perfect option. Looks great, perfect fit, and easy installation with supplied brackets. You can see the existing grille behind it when looking at some angles, but it's not a problem for me because you really have to look hard to see it and I could care less. Keep it polished and the only thing people will notice is the shine of your non-factory grille!"
5,Great Everyday Drill,"This replaced an older 9.6 Volt Makita Drill. The basics: balance is nice, not too heavy, with enough power for the DIY type projects. Beyond that, it comes with a case that holds everything even after use. Some kits are nice, but once you untie everything, the items don't always fit as nicely as they used to. This one repacks easy.Using one is straight forward and very intuitive even for a novice. Simple easy to use features don't require the manual, though the charger did require a reference for a guide on the blinking lights and what they mean. But hey, it charges fast and holds the charge for the duration.For the price, I don't think you can beat it."
5,SWEET,"I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH !!! Great price for this driver. This drill is fast, strong, light, and very cheap. I once had one that I paid 100.00 for at Lowes. Three year warranty for contractors means that as a homeowner, I feel confident having this product. The big box stores charge more for consumer models ! The diagnostic charger, two batteries, and industrial strength carrying case just sweeten the deal. If you need a strong performer and want to have money left, this cannot be beaten. Thank you Amazon.com for having what may be the best price for this product in America."
5,Good solid drill,"This is my first DEWALT tool. The drill is solid, well-made, comfortable to hold, and has plenty of torque. Definitely a step up from cheaper drill I used before, and worth paying extra for. I am using it for household work and hobby woodworking, and so far it was performing very well.Initially I considered a 12V drill, and was not sure whether 3/8 chuck will be enough. Then Amazon had a deal on this one, and I took the plunge. Turns out, this one is more then enough for household and hobby use, and I have a corded drill for situations where I need 1/2"" chuck and extra power (drilling into concrete walls and such)."
5,Best Drill Ever!,"Best drill for the money I've ever owned. Buying this drill has been great for working around the House, etc. I liked this drill so much, I bought 2 of them!"
3,Gospel by Nana Mouskouri,"As a long time fan of Nana and owner of many of her recordings in various languages I was disappointed with the CD ""Gospel"". It seems as if the choice of selections was not well thought out since her execution of them is far below her usual standard. It is also not equal to the performance of the same pieces by other artist. If Nana is going to do Christian music maybe another area than gospel would suit her style better. Her performances are usually so flawless that I bought this without hesitation and wish I could send it back."
1,Filter shipped san-packaging.,The filters arrived in the shipping box without any additional packaging. They are not even in a plastic bag. You will need to get a container to store your spare filters. I suppose you can keep it in the shipping box until use.
1,"Agree with the other reviewer, this is nowhere near hazel brown...","And poorly constructed. Too bad, we bought a Hampton Bay kitchen island and love it. This though is no where near the quality and is at best cherry in color."
3,Great choice for a small space,"We needed a cabinet for a very tight space, so our options were limited. This was one of the few that was the right dimensions. It's perfect for what it is--a nice little storage cabinet that is fairly inconspicuous. It was in good condition out of the box and was pretty easy to put together--I was able to do it by myself. While I think it was a little too pricey for what it is, it does look and feel sturdy, not too cheap."
5,Great Serving Dish,"Received this dish as christmas gift 2011 and love it! All my friends have asked where I found it, and I tell them look on Amazon. Presentation is a big factor when serving any food, and kids are more likely to try asparagus when they see how much the dish resembles the veggie. The white dish will go with any table setting."
4,Aunt's review for neice,I purchased this book as a gift for my 13 year old niece. I flipped through it to make sure it would be appropriate for her and found it so. I'm hoping she will enjoy it.
2,The type is not easy to read,"When I was 4, I learned to read from the wonderful books by Thornton W Burgess. They had lovely illustrations and LARGE print. This Children's Thrift series has such small print that Grandmothers have trouble reading them, let alone early readers.These books are old fashioned. They ascribe human thoughts and emotions to animals. You may find that off-putting. However, the natural history (how animals live and feed themselves) is realistic. If your child understands poetic license and anthropomorphism, these books are still charming. It is a shame that they are barely readable."
2,Uninteresting,This book is very hard to follow and is badly put together. find a different book to study transpersonal theory.
2,Post-Modern Navel Gazing,"I purchased this book thinking I would find a discussion of the conflicts that occurred in the past between straight feminists and lesbian feminists.How the feminist interests and goals of lesbians differ from the feminist interests and goals of heterosexual women.Instead I find myself wading through a swamp of jargon and meaningless navel gazing post-modernism.People involved with complex matters in the physical sciences can write write clearly in a language which permits most college educated people to understand the basics, if not the entirety of the concept.When I read works like this I am left feeling the use of elaborate arcane jargon is an attempt to make up for a vacuousness of actual thought.Foucault was able to write in a manner which was clear and understandable, perhaps it is time for people in today's gender studies/queer studies academic arena to take a tip from Foucault."
1,this book *sucks*,"To start off, I love a decent horror book; Barker, King, Laymon, Little, and Keene are some of my favorites, and I'm always looking for new finds.This has got to be one of the worst horror books that I have ever read. About a third of the way into it, it starts to show a little promise, but the story never gets off the ground. The author had some inconsistencies in his plot and just rambled on a lot. I got so frustrated reading this one, that I actually came back out to Amazon to look at other reviews to see if I was just not getting it. Forced myself to finish it up and have already thrown it out.I'll give another Clark title a try, and if he fails me again he goes on my blacklist."
4,A solid effort,"Vampyrrhic struck me as a little ponderous and wordy, but still a really good read. The book is clearly 'English' in style and tone, and lacks the relentless pulp drive of something like 'Night of the Beast,' but I enjoyed it anyway. IMHO 'Blood Crazy' struts the authors stuff a bit better than this one, but it's still good. A solid effort."
5,A new vampire classic,"There are only a few people who seem to be able to breathe new life (pardon the pun) into novels about the undead. King did it in the 1970s, George R R Martin did it with Fevre Dream, and a few others (Robert McCammon, Dan Simmons, and newcomer Jonathan Maberry) are the only others that spring to mind. But Simon Clark's Vampyrrhic can stand alongside any of them."
1,boring,"I made it about 100 pages into this snorefest before I could take no more. If it hasn't grabbed me in 100 pages then its just not going to. It was unforunate because this book had such a cool front cover, but Clark just went on and on and on about his characters and every now and then (very briefly) he would say oh yeah and theres vampires in the sewers. Then it was back to the characters sitting down for a chat AGAIN. I like developed characters but there is a such thing as to much. Its the same thing as going into a horror flick about vampires and thinking man I hope the first hour is a bunch of talking with some action in the last 30 minutes. Which is the formula I'm assuming this book followed because again I couldn't make myself finish it. Wow this book was just boring."
3,I was expecting pornography and instead found a pretty decent romantiic drama.,"I thought I would find kinky sex and lots of nudity like other Korean movies. Instead I found a sensitive and entertaining drama that will not bore. Yes, there is nudity and sex but by todays standards pretty tame."
5,Exactly as expected,They're envelopes. Paper and plastic. No glue/saliva tabs on the back. Just a notch of paper to tuck the lip in to. Does the job just fine.
5,Perfect,"For the application (handing out price list CDs to product dealers), these are PERFECT. Cheap, plentiful, and do the job exactly as expected."
1,GROSS,"The CD envelopes had dried blood all over them it was gross and disgusting , ended up throwing them in the garbage."
3,CD Technology 100-Pack White Paper Window Envelope Sleeves for CD Storage,Sent quickly but the quality wasn't what I expected. Very thin paper and not suitable for heavy use of the CD inside as the paper looks shabby after a few in and outs!
1,Cheap quality,I do not recommend this product. The flap does not stay down as good as Memorex brand. I would rather spend more money on the better sleeves.
5,Perfect for my needs,"Used these to organize and label my DVD collection that I needed to shrink from the box cases to easier to carry boxes. Instead of the CD/DVD binders with the sleeves in which the DVDs tended to slip out these keep them secure and compact. While very generic, these worked great."
3,CD Storage sleeves,"For the price these are more than sufficient for how i use them. Are they the best and most beautiful and in color...no, but I don't need them to be. I am grateful that Amazon offers them!"
3,Cheap,"Eh, they'll do the job, but don't use them if you're really trying to impress someone (like at a job interview)."
3,"The Music Fits the Film, But...","I like the film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but must agree with the reviewers who find the music tedious. Yo Yo Ma plays beautifully but, as with some operas, when the visual portion is missing, the music lacks a visual sense. I find the music repetitious to the point of one track sounding like the next. Night Fight is the only part that breaks from the monotonous rhythm of the music, which sticks to elegiac sound of the cello. The song, A Love Before Time, is unremarkable in expression and works best as exit music.It is with some regret that I am unable to give this soundtrack a higher rating; it sets the mood for the film but alone tends to put me to sleep."
4,"Great music, but a bit repetitive...","Crouching Tiger was one of my favorite movies of last year, though I have to admit that during the film I wasn't paying very close attention to the soundtrack. However, we were given this CD as a gift and decided to give it a try. The Chinese sound is great and suspenseful, and the feeling that Yo-Yo Ma puts into his cello is amazing. However, many of the tracks are extremely similar, and it ends with Coco Li singing something that sounds like an epic Cantonese version of an American pop song. Despite these flaws, I greatly recommend this CD."
3,"Tigers and dragons and swords, oh my!","This was an amazing movie, with an almost equally great soundtrack. Any major fan of the film or of asian instrumentation should love it. For the most part I really enjoy this, but I do wish it was more consistent in energy from track to track, as some are fairly quiet, and others were obviously for battle scenes, etc. I also wish the two versions of ""A Love Before Time"" began and ended the disc, rather than be both together at the end of it. Still though, a wonderful listen."
5,Spellbinding and Relaxing !,This is a beautiful score. It tugs gently at one's heart and soul. Highly recommended!
5,Moving,"This soundtrack is probably the best purchase I have ever made. The music is beautiful and moving. Perfect for quiet moments, as well as special ones. It is bound to captivate you."
5,cd,This was a very good product for the price it was used and had no flaws. This is wonderful music for Tai Chi.
3,"Good, but not great","After seeing the movie and reading all of the customer reviews, I truly thought that this soundtrack was going to be terrific. However, nothing made it truly stand out. Every single instrumental track sounded identical to the other instrumental tracks to the point where I could not tell when one track was ending and another beginning. The only tracks that really shined on the CD were ""Night Flight"", with the wonderful Asian drums, and both versions of ""A Love Before Time,"" which were quite refreshing, effectively resisting the strong urge of pop tracks to go syrupy sweet.Don't get me wrong, this is a good soundtrack. However, I had expected it to shine like the movie, but it only gave a disappointing sparkle."
5,"Crouching fable, hidden beauty!","I think it's a ""real"" fairy-tale for those who can still believe and search for love and kindness.And because I study cello, this soundrack, this music can take me to the far away and exotic China with an astonishing composer (Tan Dun) and with a superior violoncellist (Yo Yo Ma).Thank you both, very much!Anna, a girl from Athens, Greece."
5,Beautiful poem!,"This is a very beautiful movie with many charming tableaus. Ann Lee did very well in picking view, look those mountains and rivers, you will be really shocked by the feeling nature brings to us. That made those fight scenes in poetic sentiment indeed. You will feel an implicit aesthetic feeling about eastern. About its music, the composer is Chinese great musician Tan Dun and the performer is great cello-player Yo-Yo Ma. The score has beautiful melody and there are some Chinese folk instruments in the music. ""Night fight"" is a piece of drums, it's very cool, and the others are cello and orchestra. (Or Chinese folk instruments) The album sounds like a complete movement, very uniform. The theme song is romantic with eastern feeling. I recommend it to all fans of film score because this is an excellent eastern music that is full of poetic sentiment, you never miss it. Get it and taste it!"
4,Very good!,"I love the movie, one of the best I've ever seen. The soundtrack is wonderful, with sooth tunes and melodies. I love chinese music, and I think this is one of the best soundtrack I ever heard."
2,"Great movie, soundtrack as bad as titanic","The movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen, great foreign language stuff. Buy the Dvd now! BUT.. The soundtrack music might sound good on the movie, but not on your car or stereo. If you liked the music from movies such as Titanic then youll like this. I can only say that i didnt enjoy titanic at all. Maybe it is for you, it for sure wasnt for me."
3,Not so good.,"I bought the CD because of the movie, but was not impressed by it at all except for the last two songs by COCO Lee. This CD is boring. If you really want to listen to good Chinese Classical music, go to (...) Chinese Callssical section, because the ""Modern Classicals"" in this CD are so bad compare with the real classicals. But of course, because Chinese instruments and music as a whole is very interesting, and most of American have never listened to them, so even this soso CD still is a great attraction to Americans. But as said before, for a more knowledgeable Chinese music guy, this is truely bad, and we like to say about this kind of CD and even Crouching Tiger the movie, ""Only Americans like this kind of twisted things."
1,ONE SONG 15 DIFFERENT WAYS,"BY TRACK 6 I'M THINKING TO MESELF"""""" OH ME GOODNESS WILL THIS NEVER END???"""""" THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MUSIC????? IS I GOT IT THROUGH AMAZON.COM FOR A LOT LESS .. PEOPLE!!!! THIS IS ONE SONG . JUST ONE LONGGGG SOOONG. AND I USE THE WORD ""SONG"" AND ""MUSIC"" SCEPTICALLY. ANY HOO, YO YO MAA GIVE IT A BREAK. LESS OF HIM, AND MORE OF OTHER MUSICIANS WOULD HAVE MADE THIS A BETTER C.D. WHATEVER... I STILL HAVEN'T AND WON'T LISTEN TO THE REST OF THIS DRIBBLE. THANK YOU EVER SOO MUCH AND CHEERS TO ALL"
2,"Nothing new, same old story.",I guess this is just a genre that's never been shown in the western cultures. HK movie-makers have been making movies like this for maybe 5-10 years now if not longer. Sure if you've never seen anything like this then it's as cool as Star Wars was when it first came out.
3,Pleasant but somewhat tame,"While I throughly enjoyed the movie and the (pervasive) Yo-yo Ma snipets in the movie, I was disappointed in the soundtrack. While listening to this CD, I often caught myself saying ""Didn't I just hear that track?"" several times because, like Waldo, the musical themes for the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" keep popping up in most tracks as short, prominent interludes (and it didn't help that the ""bad guy"" theme is slightly ""Jaws"" like...). The effect for me, rather than being unifying, was more like hearing an unresolved chord, it left me waiting for the musical theme to blow itself out as a full piece (which it only partially does in the end). That being said, the ""love song"" of this movie is incredible and I was surprised it didn't win an Oscar. I would rate it right up there with Celine Dion's ""Titantic"" song (I mean that in a positive sense, if the movie was not your cup of tea...)."
3,Cruchin Tiger Hidden Dragon,Muy Buena Pelicula que hace una fusion mistica de una realidad latente las Artes Marciales y su poder en la vida real. Una exelente produccion y la musica es en escencia muy propia para cada momento de la peliculaUna produccion muy recomendada para todos los que gustan del buen cine
5,Great Product!,"This is my husband's favorite shampoo, and I can NEVER find it (except in pricey natural food stores in urban areas). It was GREAT to find this and buy it! He says it is great because it doesn't strip his hair and he can use it every day without needing conditioner. And it smells great. All around, this is a great shampoo!"
2,"Great, if you want sticky hair.","This shampoo smells great and is about as chemical free as it gets, but after washing my hair and rinsing it for an eternity, my roots are sticky. If I brush my hair, I have a hard time getting the brush through the roots, and the ends are fluffy, frizzy, and not at all ""manageable"" as advertised. They feel nice, but nobody is going to run their hands through my hair when the top is matted with grease and filthy looking. If I put my hand there, and pull it away, strands are literally stuck to my hand. If my hair is dirtier AFTER washing it than BEFORE, what is the point?"
5,Great shampoo!,"Lately my hair was feeling dry and greasy..all at once! My usual arsenal of haircare products were NOT working for me and I was desperate to try something new. I found myself looking at different shampoos in the aisle and to my disappointment, they pretty much ALL have the SAME ingredients in them...whether they be $1.49 a bottle or $20: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate and Ammonium Laureth Sulfate which I was trying to avoid. The first few ingredients in Kiss my Face Whenever Shampoo? Organic Aloe barbadensis, Rosemary Leaf Extract, and Chamomile Flower Extract. Not kidding!I tried this brand on a whim and I was very impressed with the results. My hair was soft, shiny and felt very clean afterwords. Other 'nautral' shampoos made my hair feel dry, or left a strange residue, or just made me want to go back to my usual chemical-laden standbys. This shampoo worked great for me and I would certainly purchase this again!!!"
4,A favorite,"This is one of my favorite natural/vegan shampoos. It smells nice and makes my hair soft and shiny.One thing that I was really impressed with is how well it lathers. That seems to be the one area where natural shampoos are lacking. I don't know why I care about that; I guess that I'm just used to it, and it makes me feel like it works better.I wash my hair everyday and it keeps my hair moisturized. It also makes it sleeker and less frizzy."
4,It's about quality and then some....,"A little tale that mixes a message of how to sell and how to create a product worth buying. While touted as a tale about quality, as the author is world renowned for six sigma and quality leadership, I found myself really picking up on management principles around energizing and engaging your workforce. I also was paying attention to how to and how not to try to sell. At 109 short pages this book couldn't hurt anyone's ingestion on the content."
5,A simplified look at quality,Excellent book. Breaks down the quality issue to something easy to understand. Would recommend highly.
4,A business book that reads like a short story,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, though it took me but an hour and a half to read, I found it to be substantial and inspriational. This book almost tricks you into believing it is a simple ""tale about making QUALITY the key ingredient in everything you do"" but it is truly a very smart business guide.I have to say, the last page seemed to end abruptly, but that's ok, it wasn't meant to leave you hanging."
2,samsung battery and charger,I purchased the battery for my camcorder for Christmas day so I could record my son opening presents. The battery maybe lasted an half hour before dying out. I would not recommend the battery.
2,Disappointment,The index and hyperlinks were poorly prepared for an ebook and on a Kindle first generation the screen shots were unreadable.
5,"Domestic abuse, our stories",I liked this book very much. I am a social worker and found it very helpful for me to get a better understanding of this situation. I will also apply some of these stories to the people that I deal with. I am going to buy another copy for the office so that we can add this to our lending library!!
5,THANK YOU M. WEBB,M.Webb wrote a much needed book. This book needs to be read by everyone!! Maybe through this book everyone can get a better understanding as to why abuse happens and see that it can happen to anyone!
2,"Good Pictures, Stupid Captions","The anthology has its requisite good photos, interesting shots, incredible subject matter, and sexy money shots. However, the captions the editors insisted on pasting over every photo gets tiring and annoying at best, and is a poor attempt at...what? Humor? Too adolescent. Sarcasm? The well of wit has runneth dry. Entertainment? Its the pictures you're selling, not the jar-headed captions. Why ruin a good photo set with juvenile attempts at being clever. By the time I finished flipping through it, I had no interest in leaving it on the coffee table. Save the money."
5,De Amores Luminosos,"Nydia Caro latest recording is a natural for a singer and producer of her high caliber. De Amores Luminosos is the best compilation of music that I have heard in any language (Spanish, English or German). Ms. Caro deserves greater recognition than the one she currently receives from her audience, because indeed SHE IS A REAL SINGER, COMPOSER, PRODUCER AND POET! A mix hard to find in these days."
5,A Flight with Mystic Poetry into Music,"Nydia Caro's performance is outstanding. She has grasped the meaning of the poetry of the Spanish mystics quite well as she selected the poems and the music. Her voice is pristine. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is searching for higher meanings in life, and to those who love Spanish poetry. Do not forget that this poetry can also be found in English translations. San Juan, Santa Teresa and Fray Luis are the most important representatives of the Spanish Mystic Poetry. I have always enjoyed Nydia's records, and I am pleased that she continues producing great music."
5,A MUST HAVE,DE AMORES LUMINOSOS IS A MUST HAVE. IT TRANSPORTS YOUR SOUL TO DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS WITH NYDIA'S MYSTICAL VOICE. SHE IS OUTSTANDING !
5,Busco una cancion,Disculpen la intromision en este espacio. Necesito ayuda para encontrar una cancion que canta Nydia Caro del autor Alberto Bourbon que se llama o habla de LA Abuela Soy de Mexico y no se donde buscarla Gracias a quien me pueda ayudar de antemano
2,The filter does not quite fit.,"This filter since just a little bit thicker than the original one, which causing the cover not quite able to close completely."
1,Pseudoscientific claptrap,"The Bible Cure for Allergies is nothing but pseudoscientific claptrap designed to convince the gullible that ancient peoples were somehow healthier than we are. (Most ancients lived short, pain-filled lives, but you won't read that here.) Far from being Biblical, this book would insult many conservative Christians with its constant references to New Age healing powers and the like.Reputable allergy treatments do not contravene the teachings of the Bible. There is therefore no reason for anyone, no matter how devout or religious, to resort to the unproven, ineffective, expensive remedies this book recommends."
5,Paddington is hilarious!,"You can't beat books on CD in the car to keep the kids quiet and avoid fighting! Paddington is always a crowd-pleaser! His antics and ""hard stares"" keep my boys in stitches! I have to admit that I enjoy it, too!"
1,"Beware, No Warranty","Beware of Monroe Shock absorbers. These shocks, As well as all Max-Air shocks, come with NO WARRANTY from Monroe. Make sure you have your auto parts store give you a written and signed warranty from the store. Customer service dept at Monroe is of no help even though various auto parts stores list a ""limited Monroe lifetime warranty""."
4,Philip Guston: Retrospective,"The definitive book on Philip Guston with many illustrations from each period of his work. Many excellent essays including one in his own words describing the evolution of each painting.I bought the book after seeing the exhibition in San Francisco. Fully aware that the color illustratons were disappointing in quality (some paintings show pink ground color when that just isn't so) it is still a book I wouldn't be without. But be aware, color printing really isn't up to the quality found in many art books today."
4,Great addition for Guston lovers,"This overall is a great book. It might not be the same quality that I have seen in a few other Thames & Hudson publishings, but it still is a great read and summary of Guston's work. Anyone that loves his work, this is for sure a book worth having."
4,photos and recollections superb,"1/29/03 After scanning through the many pages of illustrations and photographs and portraits of the Harleston family ,I found the book even more intriguing by going to the 'Notes'(pgs 353-371) and the Index(Pgs 375-384) and follwing through on the events in the lives of certain of the Harlestons(e.g.):Eloise""Ella"" Harleston and Edwin A.""Teddy"" Harleston."
1,"alright in basic function, but no import facility","Willpower is acceptable, as far as its function goes. It provides a scheme for detailing your assets, and a boilerplate Will and Last text. It's not clear, however, that the scheme couldn't be done comparably with a spreadsheet. In addition, the Will and Last text often needs editing, for the legal language is convoluted so it can be massaged by a computer program to handle the cases checked.However, Kiplinger provides NO UPGRADE from one year's Willpower to another, something which you'd think would be important as laws change. I was talked into buying a completely new version, which I did. Guess what: The new version has NO MEANS OF IMPORTING INFORMATION from the older version. That means you have to enter all your property all over again.The lack of a means of importing information is why I rated this at One Star. Otherwise it'd get a Three Stars.I'm on the hunt for a third-party conversions program. I may write one myself."
1,"A Poorly Executed Product, but Lots of Potential","Though the interview process goes smoothly, Willpower prompts me with an ""unexpected error - please save and quit"" when I complete the interview. Willpower will not accept a simple file name for saving my finished document, and worse, won't print. The only way I could print my finished will is to export it in RTF format. Kiplinger Technical Support acknowledges the problem as a Java conflict - but claims that since I can eventually print my document, I can't expect anything else. I'm running Willpower on a G4 iMac, using OS10.3.8 - the latest OS.In summary, Willpower gets the job done, but only with some crude workarounds to get it to print. And I cannot save any of my files once they are complete - it only lets me save if I quit midway through an interview. Willpower could be a very useful product if Kiplinger just finished the details on the development of it."
2,Lacking . . . Quicken Better,"This software is lacking when it comes to making a basic will. It doesn't allow options for giving property away to certain people in percentages if my children and spouse were not living at the time of my death. Also, it does keep giving me an error that erases what I just worked on for 15 minutes. And it doesn't let me edit the will via the wizard after completing the wizard. If you want to make changes, you have to read through the entire document to try and find where it was that you needed to change something. I have used the Quicken product in the past. And while the Quicken product is not perfect, it is better than this software. I plan on going out tomorrow to buy the Quicken Willmaker again."
4,Good DVD,I am collecting Pilates DVD's to give me new ideas to teach my Pilates classes. I do like the Winsor Pilates DVD's series.
4,would buy again,i found this to be a good buy and would purchase again. i am a beginner and found that it was challanging enough but not out of my league
1,Wrong Choice,"This product took weeks for it to come in the mail. When I did receive it, there was absolutely no packaging slip, and it was packaged in a personal brown envelope. The product was still in its packaging from Best Buy retail store. How does it work? Who knows? It is the wrong adapter. It is only for DS not DS lite. If there was a packaging invoice slip, perhaps I could return it. Totally sloppy business from Amazon this time around."
3,not fair,i personally think that nintendo should give the original nintendo ds buyers a nintendo ds lite for at least half off. the original isnt as good at the lite and there are many defects!
3,interesting,"This book was interesting enough, but I don't feel that it helped me really understand men going through a mid life crisis. I will still keep it on my bookcase though."
5,Simple,I love simple flatware. The are as great and clean up very easy in the dishwasher. I would recommend to my friends
1,Short lived,Only had this sprayer a month and the bottom of the sprayer separated and all the oil spilled out. It was hard to tell exactly why it happened but it looked as though the bottle was not one complete piece. Very disappointed since we loved it.
3,Good until it broke,"It was great for healthy cooking as the amount of oil needed to spray pan surfaces and for baked items was small and very uniform. I always took good care of it, releasing the pressure before storage, not overfilling it, and it never quite spent more than 10 minutes pressurized. It lasted about 6 months. All parts are really of good quality except for the top tip which somehow developed a little hole so now it doesn't hold any pressure. I don't know what i could have done better.I ended up buying another mister from a different manufacturer. To my surprise it was actually the same model, just packaged under a different brand. I was able to figure out that my problem was a small dent on the pump. This was enough to cause air to escape when pumping so no pressure ever built up. I'm now very careful to take good care of this part and am back to happy, healthier cooking."
5,Works great,"It holds oil, it sprays, its cheaper than continually buying PAM, it was inexpensive, was shipped promptly and works perfectly as long as one can read the directions. I think with proper care it oughtta last just about forever. What more can be said? If you are interested in such an item, buy this one."
1,EXPLODES UNDER PRESSURE!!,"I actually used this for over a year and it worked great. Until one evening I pumped it to pressurize, and right after I began spraying there was a loud POP sound & the thing exploded. I had just added oil, not even to the fill line and OIL FLEW EVERYWHERE! Oil was dripping from me, from the ceiling, on & into cabinets, the floor, between appliances, everywhere! It sprayed 8 feet in some directions. It took hours to clean, & for weeks after kept finding little pools of oil in odd locations. Looking at the unit later it appears that the weak point was in the threads of the bottom unit. Beware."
1,Made a Mess!!,"I purchased this, filled it with oil and managed to use it once without any problems. I then put away. About a week later I noticed a mess on the bottom of my spice shelf. The oil had leaked all over. Initially thought it might be because I had put it away will a little pressure still in the container. Tried again, this time loosening the top to make sure there was no pressure in the bottle... same problem. Had to throw it out."
2,Not Impressed,"I think I'm being generous with two stars. I put olive oil in the mister and pumped it up and sprayed oil into my pan. The spray is wimpy and doesn't last long before I have to pump it again. To get the best spray, I have to hold the pan up so the mister is upright during the spray. I definitely was expecting more."
2,Another Explosion,The bottom just exploded off mine. Enjoyed the product up until now. Once it starts to clog up it is difficult to clean.
4,It clogs,It does clog if it sits awhile even with pressure released...but you can unclog it quickly and it is very handy.
3,ok,works wellwould rather have a straight cord instead of a spring cord though this way i can talk on the cell while it is charging
1,Chinese Garbage,You have to jiggle the wire to get the connection to work. Don't move you phone or the connection will be broken. I bought the right one at Walmart for 12.95.
4,A different view of Schumann,"Cortot brings his own well-thought-out views to several of Schumann's central piano works, including Kreisleriana, Kinderszenen, and Symphonic Etudes. If you are used to other versions, Cortot will lead you to unexpected subtleties in these pieces. (Cortot's Traeumerei has been much studied--he speeds up where others slow down, for example.) This album makes an excellent complement to the more familiar versions in the catalog. The discs are packed full of well-selected works, and the sound is excellent for that era (1930s)."
4,Good way to put light red highlights in your hair,"This is a good way to put light red to orange highlights in your hair. If your hair color is very light you'll notice the color is like it shows on the box. So you'd have a really rich and bright looking orange color in your hair. It looks best with longer hair, and this stuff is addicting to use so be sure that your hairstyle is already as you want it, as you may end up over-processing with this type of hair dye. I did use a lot of it and my hair was messy from too much of a certain chemical there is in the dye to make it penetrate your hair better."
5,Will boy find dog?,"Tornado is a short fun chapter book. I like this book. I recommend this book for 6-10 years old. This book is about a black dog named Tornado and a boy named Pete. Tornado is a very interesting dog. He could do cool stuff. The boy named Pete loved Tornado,but the owner found Tornado. Will he ever see Tornado again? FIND OUT by reading the book!Hale"
5,Tornado,I liked this book because there was a dog in the book i like dogs. This is the best book you will ever find!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thaught it was cool when the kid found the dog in a box.This is a exellent book for kids your guys age because im way older than you. Thank you for reading my letter. I'm better than you to.
5,Gift book for a 3rd grader,"this book was a gift for a 3rd grader and as I thumbed through it I thought it will become a ""favorite"" in her collection. Great animal story!"
2,Tornado,I think this book was okay because I like to read about tornadoes and twisters. Pete was a very nice man. Pete's dog did what he was told. I like Tornado because he did a lot of card tricks. I like Mary Lou because she fed the turtle a lot.
3,"It had some good parts, but overall it was not very exciting","The book begins when Pete, a farmhand, spots a twister heading right for the farm. The family heads into the basement, and Pete tells stories to comfort the family. He tells stories about Tornado, a dog he found after a storm when he was a boy. The stories are funny and sometimes sad. To hear the stories that Pete tells about his dog Tornado, you must read this book. You will also learn if the farm family survives this storm."
5,Didn't want to put it down,"I read this aloud to my 11 year old who loves animals. We didn't want to put it down. We laughed at Chapter 4 about the turtle, and we were worried about what was going to happen to the dog in the last couple chapters. So we ended up reading it in one sitting, and it took us maybe a little over a half hour. My eldest son was listening too, and he liked it even though he's more into action than animals.There was one illustration per chapter. The illustrations are pretty and realistic in style, but could have been a little lighter/brighter."
4,Sweet little book,"This was a great little book for my 2nd grade son to read on his own. The story was cute (about a wonderful dog) and exciting (a tornado), things he's interested in very much. This kept his attention and encouraged him to read on and finish it. I highly recommend this to any so-so reader, it will capture their imagination and it's easy reading. One part is kind of sad, but if they keep reading, it has a happy ending!"
4,Entertaining,This is a fun story for a young child to read. I would have given it 5 stars except that I didn't think the father and son were very nice to the family that lost the dog when they had to return him and when the dog came back to them they intentionally didn't take him to town so the original family couldn't reclaim him. That does not seem to me like a good example is being set. It does however set up a good discussion situation with the child and a chance to find out what they think or what they might have done.
1,Tornado by Byars,This book is soooo good! My seven year old great grandson ask's me to read it ! with him at least a couple of times a week. Really excellent!
3,Covers a wide variety of palms,"Strength: Has pictures of a wide variety of palms. Does a great job of describing the right environment for each species.Weakness: Young palms seem to be particularly difficult to identify. Pictures of both young and mature trees wold help. Grouping palms with a similar appearance with an explanation of the differences would be a big plus. Too many species look too similar for a novice to positively identify.As a Florida newbie, I am still looking for the perfect Florida palm tree identification book. This book was better than many I have found."
3,This item is not flash cards!,"Although the information and the format is quite good, shoppers should realize that this is not flash cards -- at least not like I knew them while I was studying languages. A flash card is something individual that you pick up. What I was expecting was small cards one could reorganize and carry in a shirt pocket while traveling on the bus or metro. This is a BOOK! Kaplan ought know what a flash card is.I was really disappointed."
2,Not Really Flash Cards,"This book is ""Flash Card Style"", whatever that means. I mistakenly thought it was a box of actually flash cards for vocabulary study. Also, the vocabulary is aimed at college-level written testing, so be aware of that focus."
5,Foamy,Great product. It goes on foamy so it actually sticks to the surface being treated. As the foam goes away the surface is then lubricated. Will buy again.
4,"great product,",The spray works fine after using it for my treadmill.I am thankful i bought it after the treadmill sudenly packup due to lack of spray.But with this it has come back to life and works great without much noise
3,Mystical,"This is a small, strange book, filled with Indian mysticism that I feel is beyond my plebian mind.Charles Pool is an Englishman who runs a government farming project in Bengal, teaching local agriculturists soil and crop management. He has lived there alone for many year when he is joined by his wife Louise and two small daughters who are fleeing the German occupation of Paris. There is an obvious hatred between them which is eventually explained, with his totally neurotic wife determined to keep a distance between him and their daughters. The elder girl, Emily is driven even further away from both her parents when she discovers that Louise had her pet dog needlessly put down.M/s Goddens prose is undeniably beautiful and she has the gift of painting pictures, not only of the scenery and surrounds, but also of sounds and emotions. Such an abundance of raw feelings were just too much for me to enjoy the book properly."
4,Cortelco Kellogg 2500 Desk Phone,"Color of the phone is true as shown, nice gloss red. Phone is way lighter than expected, seems to also be a lighter plastic as i was really expecting a solid heavy phone, more like the traditional original one, not the case here. Sound quality is great, has volume adjust for earpiece and ring which is nice. Buttons are soft but its not a bad thing, they are easy to press. Overall the phone is worth the price no doubt, as mentioned above, my only gripe is that i would have really liked it more had it been a heavier thicker plastic."
1,poor qaulity,"nothing like the original phones. quality is poor , when you try to dial out you push a button and still get a dial tone. waste of money"
5,No problems - great delivery!,Thank you for this phone. It is being used extensively and all indications is that it's fit the needs. Than you.
1,"Be ware, this is bassically a breeding catalog where cats are treated as sellable objects","I got myself ready for a feelgood informative movie about all the different types of cats but I had to stop watching after around 10 minutes. It's basically an oral presentation by each breeder about the cats they're selling you with some repetitive silent footage of that type of cat.I should have stopped watching in the first few minutes when they first uttered the word ""buy"".Please consider adopting your pets from local animal shelter. It will be a much better lesson in compassion for your children as well."
3,Nothing special,"It was kind of boring, not what I expected at all. Gave so-so information on specific cat breeds but that was it."
2,Overbilled,"The write-up introducing this film makes it sound like some comprehensive guide to cats. It's not. It's a vehicle for cat breeders to talk to each other in clinical terms about the professional history of their particular favorite breed.If you want to hear so-called ""cat lovers"" talk about their cats like livestock, this is the film for you.If you're looking for information about cats conveyed by people who actually love their cats, check out Cats 101.This film simply confirmed to me why it was the right decision to adopt the three rescue cats I've adopted over the last 15 years."
4,Odd set-up detracts from otherwise great book,"Now, maybe you like having a sidebar at the bottom of almost every page that doesn't directly relate to that page. Some of the time I didn't mind it so much.But when some of the sidebars go on for several pages, it's quite annoying. WotC may have been better off grouping these lengthy sidebars onto their own pages for easier reading. Such as the case with some of the adventure hooks that span four, five or more pages.Other than that, this is a great sourcebook. You get coverage of all 3 movies, including charcters, ships, planets and a little beyond. The Ssi-ruk from Truce at Bakura and many of the characters from Shadows of the Empire.Of course, not much new info is presented on the more well-known characters, but there's been so much written about them, it wasn't really expected. As usual, the place where books like this shine is the amount of info they provide on the backrgound players of the Star Wars galaxy."
4,Looks like another Home Run for Wizards,"I haven't read the entire thing, merely skimmed it, but it looks excellent. New stats on virtually every page, plus more insight into situations and characters than did previous Wizards Star Wars sourcebooks. More than anything else, the Rebellion Era Sourcebook captures the essence of the Era, the perfect guide for anyone roleplaying in the Rebellion Era.My main complaint is the limited amount of information about the Early New Republic Era, which is only alluded to in the last ten pages of the book."
1,Rebellion Era Sourcebook,This book is good for someone who has just started theexploration of the Star Wars Universe.If you read allbooks and internet SW-pages you will find Rebellion EraSourcebook very boring and poor.Many details from ExpandedUniverse were just ignored .Also the quality of photographsis terryfying.Hard SW fans should avoid this book.Onlythe cover is good in that product.
2,Not impressed,"I am not impressed with these wipes at all.They do not do what they say they will and will never buy this product again,glad I only ordered the small package."
1,Not worth reading,"Everything in this book was just too unbelievable. I actually disliked the characters, especially the heroine. Borrow this from the library if you really want to read it, but I wouldn't waste good money on this book."
3,Psuedo stereo es no bueno...,"This is enjoyable live, early Kenton and the six selections featuring Ms. O'Day are a delite. Unfortunately these transfers have been digitally ""sweetened"" resulting in a rather distracting faux-stereo effect. Wish they hadn't tinkered so much. Still, for the avid Kenton and/or O'day fan, this trip back to the sounds of Balboa is worth the price of admission."
5,Great Booster!,"We love this booster! My daughter says is it much more comfortable than the Britax Parkway we have in our second car and the giraffe print is very cute. The head support is comfortable and keeps her neck from falling forward when she sleeps on longer trips. With the Parkway, she was constantly leaning forward to see around the head support, but is able to see around the support of this seat while sitting upright and is not leaning forward at all! We have not had any problems with the fabric being too grabby as another reviewer experienced and in fact really like the soft cushy feel of the fabric. Definitely a five star seat!"
1,FAILED Safety Test October 2008,"October 1, 2008. On this morning's edition of NBC's Today show, I learned this booster failed testing performed by the American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Of course, I recently purchased 2. I'm trashing them & going back to Britax (which I had previously used)which was one of the brands that received the highest score. Check MSNBC-Today Show website for complete results & recommendations."
4,Great Booster seat,"I ordered this just before my daughter's 4th birthday. When it arrived, I realized that it was much more comfortable for her than her car seat, so we started using it right away. She loves it!! It is quite plush, making long rides easier on her. The moveable arm rests make her getting in and out of the car easier, the two cup holders help contain snacks and drinks and the seat belt is held in place by the high back. Everyone admires her giraffe print, and I am quick to tell people to check out this company. They make a great product."
4,First Puma Purchase,"I was in a bind when my Nike cleats blew out at the end of the season, so I figured why not try something new. I decided to give the Puma brand a try, and I am very satisfied with my first purchase. These cleats fit your foot extremely well, and I would recommend them to any player from low skilled to high skilled."
5,AMAZING DVD Guitar Instructional for Beginners and Advanced Players,"FINALLY a DVD guitar instructional that makes sense! I was so impressed with this set I also bought the 3-disc set for Rock guitar as well. John is a top notch instructor. The video shows plenty of close up shots and slows down enough so that you can see what he is doing. Tab is also included through the DVD. You must print it yourself. (Roughly 35-40 pages) My guitar playing has sky rocketed since practicing with these videos one hour a day. Like anything, you MUST practice to get better. I will now only buy Rock Guitar Method Videos. Thanks John Mccarthy for your help in teaching the art of shred and Metal guitar. Keep Rockin'"
4,Really nice Sled,"Works well on hard packed snow. If the snow is not packed you need to make tracks. Steering mechanism had to be loosened but once that was done, it was easy to steer. Holes are already in the sled, ready for the installation of the rope for pulling the sled uphill, but should have been included. I would recommend this sled to anyone looking to buy a sled."
1,Fresh Fire Re-Fried,"If you have read Mario's book ""Fresh Fire"" written in 1991. Don't bother with this book. This book really is ""Fresh Fire"" re-hashed all over again with a different title and front cover. There is nothing new or different about this book that distinguishes it from Fresh FireIf you have not read Mario's book ""Fresh Fire"" written in 1991. Don't bother with purchasing ""Fresh Impact"". Instead, spend your money on the annointed and thought provoking ""Fresh Fire"""
2,Get the version with battery and charger,I bought this baretool then I discovered Amazon has the same tool with battery and charger for the same price. And both are Amazon Prime. Hmm. Which should you buy?
4,Good Arm Workout,2 workout options: Veil or Zeils (Symbols) Veil: Great workout routine to strengthen your arms. Zeils: A couple of routines designed to teach you how to use zeils and make music with your fingers. Fun once you get the hang of it.
1,quick release,There seems to be NO way to get a quick release for Vangard tripods as noone caries them including Vangard.Thanks for a useless Tripod hope you enjoy my money>
3,"Old game, and Very hard to stay alive...","This game is very old now days, and the very old bugs still remain, where the enemy has x ray vision and can spot you, even if your behind a hill or a pretty good ways off. Its annoying, and I have resorted to using cheats for the game to make it more fun, yet somewhat still challenging."
5,Best Kept Secret,"This game is really the best kept secret of first person shooter games. If your looking for something to hold you over until Medal of Honor from EA hits store shelves in Feb this is the game. Its amazing how little coverage this game gets because it has been priced at [an inexpensive] level. The game is excellent, you will not be disappointed. Its nFusions first game and they have pulled it off and outstanding fashion. Send the software industry a message, buy this game, support quality at a reasonable price!"
1,Deadly Dozen is GARBAGE,Don't waste your time and money on this game!! It crashed on me five times while trying to play the first mission so I gave up. I KNOW it is not my PC - I have played the most sophisticated PC shooter games without any problems... WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
1,Buggy,"This game freezes, crashes, and sometimes goes into never-never land when loading. It's playable when it finaly loads...which is once every 2-3 times. I recommend don't buy this game."
2,Not again?!,"I think that we saw much of it in ""Hidden and Dangerous"".O.K. it is not souch bad but unfortunately the game is full of bugs(altough I have version 1.01).The game needs to be patchedagain.What realy stupid is ""fade away"" effect of bodies.Also the animated blood is missing.Aftherall it is a wargame,isn't it?"
1,This is awful!,"If you like a game with wierd graphics, and non readable text. I have a machine that can run new games like civilaztion 3 , not this. If you decide to buy this game it's your bussiness, but it's No fun unless you don't like to play it. I encourage people not to get this."
3,Good but screws up alot,"This is a terrific game with one glitch after about the 5th try to play the game the screen would go black and i would have to press ctrl alt delete and that screws up the pc i have a good new computer but this game simply will not run. IF it did load it was a great game. I have no idea what those other people who said things about ""gray sillouhets"" are talking about all they had to do was turn off the fog button."
1,The worst WW2 game of all,"This game really sucks!Sometimes you can not see the enemy, and they are shotting toyou! What, non-see nazis?Do not buy this game."
1,To Many Glitches,"Do not get this. The gameplay is terrible, the graphics are ok but, most of the enemies are blacked out siliouttes. This game is ungodly hard and frusturating. You get what its worth ..."
4,Zumo 550 carrying case,"As I believed I would receive, the carry case for the Garmin Zumo 550 was Factory fresh and perfect in every way, except for its being a wee bit shalower in depth from the original that was included in the unit when I bought it. That notwithstanding, I am very pleased, as it provides the protection necessary."
4,Used it to replace the one when I bought the Zumo,"It is exactly what it says it is. I don't know if it is any different from the OEM? I misplaced my original, this arrived, I started using it, and found my original. I really can not tell the difference."
5,Great OEM Replacement Case,"This is the OEM replacement for the case (which I lost) that comes standard with the zumo 550 GPS (and apparently the 450). The case is very sturdy and provides excellent protection for your navigational device when it's not in use. The exterior of the side that protects the front/screen of the GPS features a thick, durable rubber material and is modestly imprinted with ""Garmin."" The back side seems to be a lightly textured vinyl. The rest of the exterior seems to be a heavy, woven nylon material. The interior features a soft lining, as well as one neoprene business card-sized pocket. A heavy-duty dual zipper provides reliable performance. It's all stitched together to create one highly-durable case that fits the GPS like a glove while offering superior protection from scratches and minor impacts. It's an excellent quality accessory that does exactly what it's intended to do."
5,excellent,"I always loved the Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame. The books written by William Horwood in the continuation of this wonderful children's story are excellent, written in the same style and spirit as Grahame wrote the original. Highly recommended."
3,"TOO WORDY, NEEDS to be MORE CONCISE","this book has good information but not much of an attention getter at all, needs to be straight to the point and have pics or charts that will be detailed but grabs you attention! It is an okay book over all but not so great when comes to actually studying for an exam..."
2,hmmmm,"I placed this book order along with another one. This book NEVER arrived! Once i received the other book i started to worry. I looked at the tracking information and it stated it was at my local post office. I called them and they stated that my address was not readable. The post office has already SENT the book back to it's orignal sender since they had not even put my contact information on there. So this company had to refund my money (which took about 10 days!)and i had to RENT the book for the semester, which turned out to be 80% cheaper and i received it within 48 hours!"
4,textbook,The book was received about 17 days after ordered and since I am used to ebay shipping I was a little dissapointed. Also there was a CD with the book originally and the used one didn't include this. Since I ordered it to save my daughter money on her textbooks I was sure I had ordered one with the CD but perhaps not. The first book I ordered was cancelled due to some problem Amazon (or whoever) had with the seller and I though that was nice - so I didn't have to go through the hassle of returning the book and trying to get my money back. Kudos to whoever did that for me.
2,Very Sketchy,"I couldn't agree more that this text is, to put it kindly, sketchy. I don't know what level it is meant for, but I'm using it in graduate school, and frankly, it isn't telling me anything I didn't learn back in Intro to Psych 101. It also appears very choppy within sections and you can tell where updates were stuck in and not well-integrated. (I always love the shoehorned-in references to women or minorities, not just a crime of this book, however.) It's also poorly written in spots, as I'm reading about something I already know and the explanation is about as clear as mud. I feel sorry for people who haven't learned some of the material elsewhere. As I will be facing this material on a licensing exam, I am in the market for another book - one that might teach me something I didn't learn in high school/freshman year in college."
4,School Textbook,"This book is not the newest release, but there really aren't that many differences between the older version and the newer release. The biggest change is that two of the chapters have been combined into one in the newer book. Altogether it really contains the same information."
2,LOTS OF SPELLING AND EDITING ERRORS!!!,This book is loaded with spelling errors and editing errors. I am at pg. 54 in my reading and I have already found 5 errors. I cannot comprehend people who get paid thousands upon thousands of dollars to edit a COLLEGE text book and they cannot do their jobs. I am to the point now where I am reading about Evolutionary Developmental Psychology and the picture of the monkey is overlapping some of the text in the book. How is anyone supposed to study? Its down right annoying.
2,Biased and broad,"As others have stated, this book is very broad on all topics. It's and introduction to psychology book, which is why I am very dissapointed to be using it at this level! I felt some of the studies they refference may have been warped, to sound how they wanted it to sound. I was also extremely dissapointed with how poorly they covered controversial topics. The book was obviously biased (see the abortion chapter)and didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. It comes with a cd, which I couldn't get to work on any of my computers.This would be a good book for intro Psych classes."
4,good book,"Good book as far as text books go. I have found that some of the words are missing. They just did not get printed. So I have been having to ""fill in the blanks"", other than that it is good."
3,"Clear, concise, and easy read","This book is good, it nicely divides the psychological stages of life according to accredited psychologists into a simple to understand context."
2,Far too many editing issues,"It's hard to take seriously or have any confidence in a book that contains so many spelling and content errors. For example, when describing the scientific method, the text lists four steps that don't match the key terms/glossary box on the same page. The first word after the first bullet on the first page is also spelled incorrectly. I could go on, but...very shoddy. Fortunately, I only rented the book and didn't have to pay full price at the college I attend."
3,Very brief explanations of Life Span stages,"Although the book is very colorful and has many articles that can help people use the knowledge in everyday life, the chapters (divided into life stages) are very sketchy and have very little new knowledge for college-aged students."
5,Great Book,The book was chosen due to my Child Development class which I am taking at college. I think it was an interesting book and has great stories.
5,A Rediscovered Gem,"The Skatalites sessions produced with Justin Yap have grown to legendary status among the ska loving community for quite some time, largely due to the fact that many of these recordings either were only available on vinyl, or not available at all. Luckily, westside recordings found mr yap(now a cab driver in new york) and managed to start re-releasing his material. While most of these volumes were compilations of one sort or another, this particular release actually re-releases an entire album, adding to bonus takes previously unissued. This is some of the highest quality the skatalites would ever record in their short two years together. Trumpeter Johnny Moore has even been quoted as saying he believs it to be the best sessions the band ever did. This should be a definate buy for any skatalites fan, or anyone seeking a good example of reggae's roots."
4,4 out of 5,Bench is solid on the metal parts but the plastic pieces came in broken and keep popping out where the weight holders slide up and down. I had to glue them back together and glue them to the metal to keep them from popping out. Leg lift works well and doesn't wobble much like my last one did...was pretty easy to assemble.
2,Okay!!!,The bench was quite easy to put together... But the parts remain a lil loose even after tightening....Go on craigslist and purchase a used bowflex
2,"Not as great as it seems! took too long to arrive, got lost.",http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LG3SOI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis item was not as great as I thought it was. First off it took me over a whole month to get and no one would return my call. I called several times to Amazon and UPS to no avail. Finally at about 1 month in I finally found out that my order was lost. Got the equipment and its not as great as I thought it was.
2,"Horrible packaging, damaged, and too short","I received this huge and heavy thing in the worst damaged, shrink wrapped, and re-shrink-wrapped package ever and it still had holes for loose parts to fall out of. The big metal tubing had some huge dents from shipping, and an important welded on support for decline was bent beyond use. The second I tried to bend it back, the weld just popped apart. The top part of the bench is so short my whole head hangs off the end when it is in the incline position, and I'm just under 6 foot tall. I would have returned it but it's just too much of a beast. And the instructions were horrible, almost as if for a different product."
3,"As other reviewer said, no useable incline position.","As another reviewer said, there is no useable incline position on this bench.I ended up getting a power rack; save yourself the trouble and buy a power rack and get a standalone weight bench for use with the power rack.I only really use this bench for the flat bench. Once I get a standalone weight bench, I won't even have a use for this bench since incline is not useable and I'd prefer to have the safety of a power rack because I lift alone.I don't understand how this product made it to production with an incline position that is dangerous. You can't use incline with any reasonable amount of weight without risking serious injury: how are you supposed to grab the bar from behind your head and pull it over you to attempt incline benches?"
1,Expect Problems,"Received in packaged torns to bits, steel bars damaged, seat cushions damaged, oil leaked throughout package. Called Phoenix and they agreed to ship parts right away, but then got ""delayed"". Jeff - was very nice about it all. Eventually got the replacement parts in good condition. Still many problems when finishing assembly. Grips for different bars are hard plastic and just split into pieces when you try to put them on. Chest bench not at proper angle to remove bar to begin exercise correctly. All padding/seating super cheesy. For the price I expected not ""forever"" quality which would be fine for one 5'2 female using it, but I'm not sure this thing will hold up for the weight I want to use on it either."
4,Best brush ever,"Can't add to all the superlatives already written. It's the first brush I've ever had that does not tear at my hair. I took one star off solely for the price. Like the phone company of days gone by, they can do it because there is no real competition. This is absolutely the best available."
5,brush,"nice brush and very different from others that try to imitate it, I like using it on my hair and use it all the time"
2,Meh..,Overpriced. I don't know if I love it but I don't hate it. Seems like a good brush but totally not seeing how it is worth the $$$.
5,It has been a hit with my lady.,I thought it was crazy to spend this much but the brush look and feels really high quality and one can imagine it could last a lifetime if taken care of properly. The packaging and extra cleaning brush inside make it feel like a really solid product that you can feel excited about giving as a gift.
3,nice brush,"It's a pretty good brush, although not that much more amazing that something I could get in a store. Not sure it's worth the price."
2,Keeping Barney Review,"Keeping Barney is a book about a girl who sees an ad in the newspaper about a horse who needs a home for the winter. When her parents tell her that she can keep the horse for a the winter, she is elated. After having the horse for a while he becomes a BIG trouble maker! The girl is having a hard time getting him to trust her and obey commands. This is a book that isn't for everyone. It is so descriptive at times that the reader forgets what the story is about. Some of the characters aren't realistic at all and the horses behavior isn't realistic either. The characters who are supposed to have experience in something seem to know nothing about the subject. This book contains good information about horse care and riding. That is the one of the only good points."
3,Don't take it seriously or else you'll miss a few laughs,"Compared to the other Filipino movies I've watched (which is very limited to what I've seen when I was young), the production and choreography of this should be given a higher rating. Granted there were some parts that dragged the movie a bit and would have been better off being removed. The effects could have been better and the costumes not so Sailor Moon-ish (although I understand that bright colors are the staple of lots of superheroes).The comedic timing of every snide comment or unlikely situation was great.The pros that got my attention about this movie were the musical numbers - all the actors/actresses had very good singing voices, especially Rustom Padilla (when he wasn't over-acting, especially the duet with Alfred Vargas) and Zsa Zsa Padilla. Speaking of which, those two plus Chokoleit actually made the movie a little easier to bear.Yes, it was cheesy, but I didn't notice since I was laughing throughout the whole movie."
4,BEAUTIFUL SCONCE,"Very well made, lights work, remote is simple and works. I read other reviewer and thought the light emitted would be less than I find it is. Wanted something pretty to look at during the day and for use as a ""glorified nightlight"" during nights, and for those electrical black out times instead of fumbling for a flashlight. Overall very pleased with it. Would have been 5 stars at a little lower price than $85.00."
2,"PRETTY, BUT ...","THIS WAS PRETTY ON THE WALL, BUT THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THAT CAME FROM IT WAS HARDLY ANYTHING, IT ONLY LIT UP THE LITTLE SPACE ABOVE IT ON THE WALL, BUT NOT THE HALL I WANTED IT TO."
3,"It's OK, not great.","Thurman is no doubt a gifted scholar, but like in his other presentations I've seen, he can be a bit dry. If you expect deep, insightful, information-packed lectures you'll be a bit disappointed. As for the video itself, the production quality is a bit low. It has a 'home movie' feel to it, so you won't be seeing the sights and temple artifacts and artwork perfectly lit and in breathtaking HD. Essentially, the film feels like a class field trip to Tibet on which someone brought a video camera---and I don't mean that to sound negative or critical, as it certainly has a more intimate and personal style than a staged and polished production would; I mention it only so people know what to expect. All in all, I'd say it is worth watching if you have a strong interest in Tibet."
3,Chuck Brown concert CD,"The music was good, I enjoy Chuck Browns music to me it seems the songs was cut short I wish I could have bought the original cd instead of the down load"
1,Don't buy this item,"The item which arrived was not as described (beige cable instead of the pictured black). When Amazon sales was contacted I was told basically that 'sorry, but we have no control over this'"
2,Dated and boring,"I don't know what I expected, maybe something more evocative of the place and time. It's a very ""told"" story, not shown, lacking in convincing detail. It may well be an impressive accomplishment for a nineteen-year-old author, but that is not saying much. The first person narrator is a sheltered girl of fifteen to sixteen, and the narrative is predictably dull as a result of her naivete, and of the remove. It was a waste of time for me, perhaps interesting as a period piece. Not entirely without insight, but there are so many better books."
2,"Made in China, way too tight","This leather phone cozy fits so tightly over my mobile phone that the plastic key-cover prevents the buttons from being pushed - I think they're all being depressed at the same time because the cover is too tight. For that matter, the phone won't close with the cover on it - it would probably have to be stretched onto and off of the phone each day to loosen it up, but I don't have that much time to do stretching exercises for my phone since my old cover wore out over 3 or 4 years' time.The reason I gave this 2 stars and not 1 star is that it definitively has holes stitched out that were obviously designed for this phone and not another - so there was at least some thought to the design - but that doesn't make it much more functional if I can't dial with the case on or close the phone."
2,Snooty,"This book is gorgeous to browse through, with interesting typography, and beautiful photographs. The recipes are very complicated and almost always use ingredients that I don't recognize. For some reason it also bugs me that they refer to soy sauce as Shoyu all the time. I've made two recipes from this book. One was a marinated, crusted and baked tempeh recipe that was very underwhelming for all the work it involved. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you want to flip through a book to get hungry and put it up and get take out!"
1,Disappointing and overrated.,"This book was all pretty pictures and pretty bland recipes. It is overpriced, overrated, and distinctly inferior to other vegan cookbooks that may not have the cachet of a trendy restaurant but provide more value for money. I gave this coffee table book away. (the layout is difficult to work with if you want to actually cook with it.)"
4,Vegan Fusion World Cuisine: Healing Recipes and Timeless Wisdom from our Hearts to Yours,"I do like this vegan cookbook a lot. It is very colorful. The recipes are very interesting and pretty easy to follow. There are also many uncooked recipes. Those are BIG PLUSES to me. Unfortunately, some of the ingredients used e.g. soy products and seitan are not healthful. They are detrimental to health. I will modify some of the recipes accordingly for greater health benefits.I would recommend this book but include warning about the dangers of all soy products e.g. tofu, soy milk, seitan , etc... except miso and tempeh."
2,Scared to try it again,I have tried a few recipies out of book and none of them were very good. I even threw out an entire pot of sauce and a whole pan of bars. This is definetly not my favorite vegan cookbook.
3,"Beautiful Book, Not so thrilled w/ recipes","I was very excited about this book, the layout is beautiful and interesting, and practically worth purchasing the book simply for the design. But the recipes weren't the most practical, and those I tried were rather dull. Didn't seem to be anything too new that I hadn't seen before."
2,Too obscure,"This is a very beautiful book BUT the recipes are incredibly complicated with very, very obscure hard-to-find ingredients. I'm a pretty adventurous cook, but even these are way over my head. Most of the recipes include at least one recipe- as in, a sauce or whatever that you have to first make in order to make the featured recipe. Ugh, this was a waste of money."
5,Life changing,"Bought this book after visiting our daughter in Columbus Ohio and taking her to a vegan restaurant called Dragonfly. The restaurant lived up to it's excellent reputation. No idea vegan could taste that good.The recipes in this cookbook are also that good. Although not vegeterian, we have been cooking many meals vegeterian meals for 25 years. The recipes are well written but I would not recommend it as your first vegeterian or vegan cookbook. The Moosewood cookbooks make a better introductory cookbook."
3,A couple of great songs,"I would give 5 stars to ""Absolution"" by the Marionettes off their rare RISE album, and ""Satinesque"" by Vile Priest, which is a lovely acoustic instrumental piece much different from what I was expecting from a band with such a name. I don't know what ""For What It's Worth"" is doing on here and it's totally out of place. I enjoy the Gene Loves Jezebel song, ""Sweet Rain"", but it shows up on a lot of compilations, as do most of the other songs on here. So it's not so much that the songs are bad, but some are either inappropriate or just rehashed so often on other Goth collections that there doesn't seem a point in including them.The Vile Priest and Marionettes song is worth the modest price of the CD. I'd like to find more by VP but can't seem to locate their work anywhere. The Marionettes, too, are hard to find."
5,A recipe for sleep deprivation,"Aside from the less-than-helpful manual and bad choice of accents for voice-acting in the English version (good old boys from the South and Chicago gangsters), I honestly haven't encountered a CRPG this immersive and addictive since Arena and Daggerfall. Like the aforementioned games, this one offers plenty of choices in terms of character building and how you want to approach the overall storyline. The graphics and sound are stunning. The world itself is more alive than any I've seen to date. The combat system is great. Overall, there is enough here to satisfy any die-hard gamer. :-)"
2,Boring game with horrendous controls,"If you love LONG segments of nothing but talking this game is for you. Half this game is you trying to extract the right info from people and only one tenth of what they have to say is useful. The rest is the standard ""shooting the breeze"" that game makers think creates ""atmosphere"". Gothic held some comic value for me as I started to see it not as an adventure game, but as a bizzare excersize in making boring people get to the point. This is a useful skill to develop in this world so I give Gothic an extra star.Why do game makers feel the irrational need to make you learn a completely different control system for every new game? Gothic is the worst in this example of this trend. Sure there's SOME key binding customization available--just not for the actions you actually want. Not only are you banned from binding actions to mouse buttons, but Xicat breaks new ground in game control idiocy by forcing you to hold down TWO(2) keys to do practically everything."
5,Gothic: First in the PB series,"There's a walkthrough on the net, and I highly recommend it to start you off right. Read the Story of Gothic first so you have a better idea of who you are as ""Noname"", and then practice the controls in the walkthrough a lot before you leave the path through the mines. I preferred the ""alternate"" WASD keybd setting, plus I enabled RControl to share the ""action"" of LControl. Gothic is the start of what I consider to be the best PC game series ever written. You will follow the quests of Noname through Gothic 2, Gothic 2: NOTR, Gothic 3, and the soon to be released Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, which will take us to Gothic 4 which is about a year away. Believe me, it will take you a year to do this, but you will enjoy every minute."
3,"""wanna buy uh duck?!"" ""Yeh! Heya Heya!""","""I'm looking for some swampweed"" Is the only grown up thing you can do here. The nakedness and sexual content is removed(for owr ""Tender and ""impressionable"" american eyes). This has some violence but no blood.(a ""child"" needs to see the ugly side not to do it) Atari is stupid. However there are edits you can do to ""remove"" the ""undergarments of women"" or some such. ""You didn't hear it here"". That said. It is still fun. You CAN do drugs as in part II and you can peddle them(in fact you have to to get dough at first). You are a prisoner, so why in heck(other word) not! Thier is a serious bug when you near the magic dome(feild) you will not die, the game will crash and it will blotch it up permantly(as in re install). If you don't wish to waste time on this game(as in story continuety) don't. Part II has good ref to this and playing this is not nessasary to fully understand the II story line."
3,"Good bag, too big for a sony dcr dvd.","I've purchased this bag a month ago and it was great. You have enough space to put all accesories and much more into this bag.But if you have a Sony DCR DVD camcorder, maybe, this bag could be considered too big, for example, the camcorder fits in the bag's pocket.Price/Quality is very convenient.If you love big space to carry more than your camcorder, this bag is for you. But if you have a minimalistic soul, just thing in a smaller one."
4,Good product but very big to carry.,"This is nice and only draw back was it is a little big to carry. For a small camcorder, you don't need this much big bag. Otherthan that it is nice."
2,"Artsy, Not Artistic","Since opinions on this recording of the B minor Mass seem about equally divided between high praise and angry dissent, I cannot resist adding my voice to those of the dissenters. The chorus lumbers through the Kyrie with such depressing lethargy that all subtlety is lost. At other times everyone seems in a desparate hurry to finish in time for lunch. Apparently Herreweghe believes that finding the most appropriate tempo is a matter of averaging out extremes. There are some fine moments to be found here, but they cannot begin to compensate for the willfull eccentricty of the overall performance.Maestro Herregweghe's self-indulgence interpretation reminds me of those theatrical performances in which the director, anxious to leave his mark on another type of classic, straps six-shooters on Hamlet and relocates him to Texas."
5,The Best I Have Heard,"I am an experienced listener and a huge Bach fan. I have listened to hundereds of hours of his music, and I have to say that this recording is one of my absolute favorites. This is THE interpretation of the Mass in B minor."
4,Amy Ray out on her own,"While Ms Amy Ray is one half of the dynamic duo: The Indigo Girls do not expect an Indigo girls type recording. Ms Ray has stripped down to the bare rock basics of two guitars, bass and drums. She has recreated the great tradition of the garage band (think neil Young and Nirvanna). Not only that but the music and playing shows that she is having a really good time doing it! I saw her in washington, D.C. and she broke a string. normally not a problem she just hands the guitar to a techie and gets a new one to carry on. well, this time she told the audience to talk amongst yourselves while she went and got another string and replaced it on stage! I have not seen that since high school. That is a bare minimum tour and she rocked out! this recording truly captures the spirit and sound of the tour. What we heard is what is on this recording. I recommend this recording to anyone who remembers great live recordings such as the James Gang and The Who."
4,Casino Versus Japan - Whole Numbers Play The Basics,"Too often, IDM lacks a certain warmth in the music; not so in Casino Versus Japan's album, Whole Numbers Play the Basics. There's a sonic pool for ""Aquarium"" to swim in and the temperature is just right. Same goes for the wobbly Boards of Canada-like melody on ""Summer Clip."" By contrast, ""Where To?/What For?"" isn't as much warm as it is bright and shimmery. There's also a bucolic strain going through ""Making Lake Park in the Sun"" which immediately makes on peaceful and well. Sure, many of the sounds are derivative of other IDM groups, but the quality on this album still makes it worth a listen. Or any number of listens."
1,Truly a waste of time....,"This is crap. Don't buy it unless you just have to have everything to do with Madonna. Unlike the ""Virgin Voices"" cd of last year, this ""tribute"" to the Queen of pop is low quality. The singing is just awful, the production value is non existant. Forget this cd and go listen to drunk people grind their way through Like a Virgin in a karaoke bar. At least that's funny and mildly interesting. As cheap as this disc is, it's a waste of money."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC!,"Truly Awful is more like it. I love to hear bands' interestng interpretations of other artists' songs, no matter how wrong-headed. But this disc simply offers anonymous bands (whose names sound familiar but only because they are close to other band names - ie Kylie Minow as opposed to Minogue) who recreate, quite badly, Miss Madonna's songs. And, somehow, I was unfortunate enough to end up with a two-disc set of this dreck entitled ""Strike the Pose."" This ""Simply Blue"" disc is the same as disc one of the set I bought. Instead of this garbage, try ""Getting into the Grooves"" on Vitamin and ""Tranceformed"" on Strictly Hype Records (both of which I purchased today in a real store(!) and which are quite good) for actual interpretations of Madonna's music which are worth listening to."
1,Not as good as Madonna,The music is flat and vocals are so so. Buy the real thing ifyou want Madonna! It is worth it for the real McCoy!
4,"pleasant read, misleading title","This is very pleasant reading, although it isn't history. It is more of a meander along the coast of the Cape and Islands. Paul Theroux expressed it well in his review in the New York Times, calling this a work of ""intelligent peculiarity,"" and complaining that the history of the Cape and Islands that we are promised in the title, is never delivered in the text. What we get instead are Schneider's rather charming musings about topics like Pacific whaling and first encounters between Amerindians and Europeans. As Theroux points out, if someone actually wanted to understand the region, this book would, at best, provide a place to start. I enjoyed it, but on the whole I preferred Reflections in Bullough's Pond. Talk about misleading titles! What were they thinking to stick a word like 'Reflections' on a really fine book?"
2,snooze,"I disagree with the previous reviewers on all points but one. Meander hardly does justice. Schneider's prose is enough to put anyone to sleep. As for long summer afternoons on the front porch, if the object is to take a nap, skip this book and get right to the nap. The point I agree with the others on? check out Bullough's Pond, it's a much better read."
4,very nice book,"I went into Cabbages and Kings to buy this title and, on impluse, also picked up Reflections in Bullough's Pond, mostly because of the beautiful jacket shot. I had not heard anything about the book Bullough's Pond, whereas one can hardly miss hearing about Enduring Shore. What a surprise the two books were. Enduring Shore is a very pleasant read, it takes you along all of the familiar channels of Cape history and lore. It is very nicely written, but there are no surprises here. I do think it is more fun when a book surprises me, dazzles with a bit of lyrical prose, uses a turn of phrase to make me see familiar things in a new light, tells me something that I never knew, or makes me think of something in a fresh light. Bullough's Pond does all of that, Enduring Shore was more like having a friendly chat with an old acquaintance. No surprises, just a very pleasant way to spend a summer afternoon."
1,Good idea but bad quality,"The product funcionality feels like real endermologie. However after I used it 5 times the machine stopped working. It is made in china and only last for a few sessions of massage. If you compare the price with a endermologie session you can say there is some advantage to buy the machine and get 5 sessions for the price of 1 at the spa. Anyhow, I would not spend my money on that."
1,Verseo Roller Cell Massage,"This is nothing but a rip off, I knew it the first time I started to use it. The whole concept makes no sense. I should have sent it back."
1,A bitter man can't handle the truth,"Maybe Mr. Bugliosi should read the countless follow-ups to the election by the Miami Herald and other major newspapers that clearly state George W. Bush would have won the election if the re-counts in Florida had continued.Funny how he conveniently forgets this part in his book.It appears Mr. Bugliosi needs the limelight again after the Manson Murder case no longer provides it to him.Bugliosi bases one of his tenants of his argument on Justice Scalia saying further recounts ""would do irreperable harm to George Bush"". Bugliosi totally misinterprets Scalia's argument. The point was if ballots that were not deemed credible were counted for one party or the other in one part of Florida and not in the other, could in fact change the results in an unfair basis.Get over it Mr. Bugliosi. Stick to writing something credible. This was a waste of..."
1,History will regard them as Heroes,"Thank God for this Supreme Court and its seven members that seem to have some semblance of what our U.S. Constitution actually means. Hopefully it will happen again that our schoolchildren will be taught that the USA is a constitutional republic and not a democracy. The thought of being a democracy scared our founding fathers over 200 years ago and it still scares me today. Benjamin Franklin stated that ""we have a republic, if we can keep it."" We may not be able to keep it much longer with the thoughts that Bugliosi and the Flordia Supreme Court espouse."
1,How can it be?,"The Supreme Court makes a ruling, the only possible constitutional ruling, which upholds the constant result of every ""recount"" and cites the equal protection clause, thereby protecting every American's right to equal protection under the law, including Mr. Bugliosi's. So how can making a ruling which does nothing more than maintain the status quo rather than overturning the election results based on counting a handful of spoiled ballots from three or four areas which are controlled by only one side while totally ignoring many, many more, and calling that ""counting *all* the votes"" be considered choosing the president?A simple analogy: If you have one hundred pennies and you grab some of them and count them out and come out with 10, do you have a dime? According to Al Gore and his supporters you would. All the Supreme Court did was to confirm that what you in fact have is not a dime, but a dollar."
2,Like a Jr Hi boy,"Like a Jr High boy, Bugliosi has the information but comes to the wrong conclusions. It doesn't work that way, son."
1,Disappointed in Bugliosi,"I've loved reading Vincent Bugliosi's books since ""Helter Skelter,"" but this is ridiculous. I didn't know Bugliosi could be so hysterical. Molly Ivins wrote the foreword. That tells us all we need to know. Need I say more? Okay, I will. Its obvious he voted for Al Gore and was determined to justify the Florida Supreme Court ignoring Florida election laws, helping Al Gore twist things to his favor, and to demonize the USSC for stepping in and stopping the blatant robbery of a national (not ""state"") election. What the Florida Supreme Court was doing was truly frightening and disturbing to me, and I believe the United States Supreme Court only stepped in to stop the insanity.This is one Bugliosi book that wasn't a bestseller. Gee, I wonder why?Nice try, Vince."
1,Sore Loosers,"What a bunch of grumbling sore loosers,this book is just another conspiracy scare.The fact is the country was split,it could have gone either way.Lets get over it and move on!"
2,"OK, you're right. So What?","The Florida vote count was certified with Mr. Bush winning by a paper thin margin. Mr. Gore's supporters immediately began a campaign to discredit the ballots, the Florida Secretary of State, and the intelligence of the Florida voters in selected counties. The first judicial outrage was perpetrated by the Florida Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court only became involved when it was obvious that the Florida court was determined to hand the election to Mr. Gore. Yes, the U.S. Court had no business ruling on a state issue but neither did the Forida court. Given the close tally, there should have been a statewide recount, including absentee ballots. As it turns out, Gore would have lost the very re-count scenarios his cry-baby supporters were demanding. I sincerely hope Mr. Gore is the Democratic nominee in 2004, 2008 and 2012."
1,Expected Political SLant,"Anywhere along the way in the dispute surrounding Flordia, Vincent Bugliosi and Molly Irins openly stated their desire for Gore to win. Reading this book is nothing more than Bugliosi name calling, making claims about the justices that he can't back up, and trying to twist information for his own purposes. If you're a die-hard democrat, you'll love the book because it strokes you. If you are looking for a thought provoking book, look else where."
5,Very Well Done (If you read it),"Molly Ivans' review of this book hits the nail on the head: here is a modern day J'accuse, and that is in part to say that Bugliosi's conclusion, like Zola's, is inarguable. Negative reviewers who point to any ultimate result of the 2000 vote count or re-count giving the election to Bush have missed the point of this book either because they didn't actually read it or were too dim to understand it."
4,good information,"I'm amazed that a book like this can even be controversial. As a Canadian who watched the American elections from the outside myself, like most Canadians, recognized Bush's election for the sham that it was. In fact our newspapers ran stories about how the recount proved Gore's victory when the American newspapers were silent on the issue. This book is an important read that, despite the naysayers, does help to prove the truth of the recent fraudulent election. Many Americans I've talked to however still deny the fact that Bush actually lost even though my country--along with the press and political analysts of most of the world *outside* of the U.S.--believes the opposite. So, really, this book shouldn't be that controversial..."
