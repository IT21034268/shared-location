2,WIRELESS HEAD PHONES,"Worked 1 night and not the next. Pluss extremely tight. Sounded ok, not great. Foar the money they would have been ok, but since they did not work, I'll send back"
5,great with modifications,these headphones are awesome the sound is very crisp and clear and it takes highs pretty well and there is a very very faint background noise and you cant even hear it if you are listening to something i bought these in spite of good reviews and i was right these are awesome and the people that say that there is a loud hissing noise dont know what they are talking about so i would recommend these headphones 100% all the way o and i had a pair of turtle beach headphones for my xbox 360 {which are great} that had the over the ear design so i took the padding off the sennheisers AND put them on my turtle beaches and put my turtle beach padding on my sennheisers worked out great and now i love them even more thanks sennheiser.
4,A blessing for the hearing-impaired,"I love my earphones. I had a little trouble figuring out how to hook them up through my cable box. I called the Sennheiser Customer Service number & talked to a nice guy who gave me some info on what to buy @ Radio Shack for the hookup. The Radio Shack clerk didn't recognize the items I was asking for & sold me what he thought I needed. When I got home with the equipment, I called again & talked to a different guy who said that I had the wrong stuff & told me what I should buy; I got his name. Back to Radio Shack & exchanged the equipment. The next morning I called the second guy, by name, and he walked me through the process, which was easy. If I didn't live just a few miles from Radio Shack, this would have been a pain. So, anyway, they are hooked up & I LOVE them! The sound quality is excellent & I can wander all over the house & still hear the TV audio. Highly recommended."
4,Very Good Wireless Headset,"I was very skeptical before buying this product, because all my earlier wireless headset product failed to satisfy my expectation. Even a small humming noise used to bother me.But this product changed all my perception. It is almost 6 months and I cannot be more happy. It is very good product and sound is crystal clear.I am giving 4 star (wanted to give 4 1/2) just that some time (occasionally) I get very minimal humming sound in one particular direction. I checked my wireless phone and router, removed from the vicinity, but some time, I do get that.But overall I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it."
3,EARS,"the head phones work great, excellent sound, only problem is they do not fit well, if you get up and move you have to hold your head very stable or head phones fall off. i would think for nearly $100 they could come up with a design that would allow you to move about a little bit and not have to hold these phones on your head."
1,Bad Fit,"My problem with this head set is it is made for someone with a very large head. I am a 71/4 hat size and they are too large,because of this fact I leaned over, they fell off and fell two feet to hard wood floor and no longer work."
3,Didn't work for me,"Sound was great and I was able to walk outside in the back yard and still hear it without any issues. I was making cookies once, though, and the mixer interfered with the sound (caused a bit of temporary static).I biggest complaint is this: I use these to listen to the TV while running around the house doing chores (laundry, dishes, vacuuming, sweeping/mopping)... And every time I bent over just the slightest, these would fall right off my head. I don't have a small head, either. And these were very uncomfortable to wear with earrings (I just wear studs).So I'm sending them back and getting RS 130 model that will completely encase my ears and hold onto them. I have had these in the past but they broke, so I went with the $50 cheaper model (this one)... but am very disappointed in the comfort factor. Otherwise, they're great... but that's much too big of an obstacle for me to ignore."
1,Brain frying sound blast!,Auto-shutoff is probably the worst feature I've ever seen. The blast of loud sound happens after pausing my audio output for a few minutes! I've thrown my head phones off more than once after the punishing blast of sound.
3,Ticking Headphones,"I didn't search very long through the products, and picked these headphones very quickly. I am an architecture student and I wanted headphones that I could walk around the room in and still be able to hear my computer without disturbing the other students.I love having the headphones, but there is a very annoying ticking sound that happens sometimes when the volume of whatever I'm listening to goes down. Sometimes when I adjust the knob it goes away, but almost always comes back within a short amount of time. I'm keeping them because I don't know if this is a regular thing for wireless headphones and I don't have any other complaint.They are a bit cheaper than some of the other choices, and having the charging cradle is very convenient."
3,What's the secret?,"Sounds great, as long as I don't move my head. What's the secret to keeping it on your head. I feel I have a normal type head with medium length hair. Every time I look down or move my head, the headphones fall off. Does anyone have a solution?"
4,Great sound. A little pricey.,I got them over the weekend from a local place. That way I could listen to them before buying as many times headphones are too bas-y for my taste.These are ultra clear.A little bulky but Ive found those usually provide the better sound.Hiss bothered me until I tried turning the source up high and the headphones down lower. Then it was unnoticeable. Wish I'd bought them from Amazon for $30 cheaper But I am glad to have been able to hear them first.Im using them for the CD and dvd player. and they have an outstanding range and clarity and I could walk down one floor from the unit and still receive.
4,Lightweight Wireless Headphones,I purchased these headphones to use to watch TV when running on my treadmill. I needed headphones that were lightweight and comfortable. These headphones work well. They were easy to set-up with our cable box/DVR. The sound quality is good and the volume is easily adjustable. They fit my head well and don't fall off when running. Two thumbs up!
2,"Great sound, bad features","The wireless headphones produce great sound but....-The ear pieces are open which forces everyone near you to hear the music as well.-The transmiter is very touchy, cannot be placed near metal.-The auto signal finder works about 50% of the time and there is no way override it.-Overall: great price, great sound qualitly, poor features."
2,Comfortable?,"Decent sound but often has loud static which requires me to unplug at amp, then back on. Over a period of 2 hrs.it happens 3-5 times. Very annoying. I also find it very uncomfortable on my head. Because I had some batteries in it that became acidic i bought another pair and now have two. I since replaced both pairs with rechargeable LI-ions that work fine but I still have the static problem. Wishj I could find out what causes that?skratch98"
2,Did not work on our system- Very dissappointed given other reviews,"Didn't work on our hd tv - had to have the volume cranked way up - so purpose in purchase was defeated. May just be our TV - worked 'ok' with our older model - but we still had to have the volume up on the set and we purchased what we thought was wireless headphones that would cut the tv sound from the tv and channel the sound into the headphones. It didn't and apparently doesn't work that way. We sent them back December 28th, using Amazon's convenient site-generated mailing label. We are still waiting for acknowledgement that the package was recieved. Have been told we must wait till Jan 30 to recontact them about it. First time we've ever had to return anything. I'm getting ansy!"
3,Not what I expected,"The sound quality is good and the setup is simple. However, every 15 minutes, there is a disruption on the reception for about 2 seconds. The headphone loses the audio and becomes normal again in 1 to 2 seconds. It's annoying. I have tried different positions, but it remains the same. I don't know the reason. It might be the device or environment. I do not recommend this product."
1,Didn't work,"Right out of the box it didn't function. Tried it on all possible charging sources, including my laptop, as well as putting in my own rechargeable batteries. It was intended as a gift; fortunately I decided to give it a full charge before wrapping. Returned it and bought something else for the intended recipient."
3,Sound pretty good but you can't keep them on your head. No matter how tight you make them when you turn your head they fall off,Sound pretty good but you can't keep them on your head. No matter how tight you make them when you turn or tilt your head they fall off
2,"Poorly designed, uncomfortable, keep falling off my head - getting annoyed every evening (doesn't charge well either).","Don't sit well on one's head and not that comfortable. Can't relax in the evening when I want to watch TV. Doesn't recharge well and overall poorly designed. Spend an extra $20 and buy a better quality Sony set, which I had for years and was really happy with. Am going back to them."
3,OK. Same as the Sony I had 20 years ago. Nothing new,"These are good quality wireless headphones. 120' range - maybe on the moon. Same room - yes. Nice charging technique. I thought the wireless headphones got better in the last 20 years. However, this one has the same qualities as the old Sony I bought 20 years ago."
2,Could Be Better,"Overall, I'm not impressed. The sound quality was decent but other thing like comfort,fit and material quality is why it scored low. I feel for the money it should just be better."
4,Very practical with clear sound.,Now we are able to listen to our favorites while moving around the house doing all sort of other activities. It is also a great tool for not disturbing others and forcing them to listen to a loud broadcast.
4,Good Product,PROS: Excellent sound quality. Controls work well and do what they are supposed to do. Recharging cradle is very convient and easy to use. Hours of use on a charge are good. No exact test but I used them for two or three nights of TV on a single charge. Excellent range...works at least 3 rooms away from base.CONS: These are relatively heavy and do become tiresome after a couple of hours of use. They also fit tightly on the ears which because of the weight becomes slightly uncomforatble after awhile. I use a headrest so I let the phones go around the back of my head and therefore the weight doesn't bother me as much. Also the fact that I wear glasses may make the fit seem tighter to me.OVERALL: They do what I wanted and they look and feel like a quality product.
1,Charging Issues,"Overall, this product has performed less than hoped. To charge, the metal contacts on the headphone has to make good contact with the base unit. In order for my unit to make good contact, I've had to weigh down the headphone by putting a weighted object on top of it. It's been a frustrating experience. Also, as some reviewers have pointed out, the unit goes out of tune quite frequently. Recently, the unit started giving a periodic loud static sound."
4,"Great overall, just a little loose","Overall I have been extremely pleased with this product. It is very easy to use, I like the fact that is has a rechargeable base so it is always ready to go, and the sound is good. I also like the ability to adjust the volume from the headset. My only complaint is that I use them to do household chores and I can't lean forward or they slip forward (tightening doesn't help). I think adding an extra strap around the back would solve the problem, just haven't gotten around to it yet! I am able to get good reception everywhere in our 2-story house."
2,Not as expected!!,It has static at low volume which is very irritating. You have to up the volume (which is deafening)to cancel out the static. Not expecting that from Sennheiser. Maybe I should have looked for a bluutooth technology.
4,Limited crankability,These work great for watching tv and are comfortable on my big head. I plugged them into my ipod and tried to blast Tool and that didn't work great. It is nice to be cordless with the music and they sound good at medium volume.
3,Awkward fit,"My only complaint is that these headphones do not hold to the head. If one looks down, they fall to the floor. Had I known this before buying it, I would have looked for a better fitting model and brand."
4,TV Privacy,Purchased the ear phones so that i could watch TV without interfearing with what my wife was watching in an adjacent room. Works like a charm.
2,"Convenient, but flawed","The sound is good, the charging on the stand is good, but the headphones themselves are bulky and heavy. The fatal flaw is that when I move my head the plastic hinges creak and pop, interfering with the music."
4,excellent headphones,"This is my first wireless headphone and I think this has a comfortable fit, even after a couple hours of wear and have superb sound quality. No fade or interference, even at great distance from the base."
5,Sennheiser RS-120 wireless headphones,"I purchased these headphones in order to be anywhere in my 3 story home and and hear the music on my computer, or radio. The headphones deliver just as promised. I have had no hissing, or unusual noises, and can hear very clearly on any floor. They are always charged and ready and fit comfortably. I am most happy."
2,I must have a weird head,"The unit works beautifully, but the sound is not as good as my Sennheiser Noiseguard headphones.It is great fun to walk around the house and listen to music without bothering anyone, but the headphone fits poorly and offers little adjustment for headshape. As long as I keep my head up I am OK, but when I lean forward they slide off. Maybe it is my head (mostly bald, but it is pretty big so it should inherently fit snugly)."
3,Has its drawbacks but...,"When I first bought these headphones, I was in Tennessee, at a cousin's house. Every time I used them, they would cut out every 182 seconds - like clockwork. A 2-3 seconds break in transmission, and then they would resume playing again. This is my first piece of wireless equipment, and my conclusion was ""wireless sucks!""However, when I brought it back home with me to Barbados, and used it with my computer, I got no such problem. So I started to believe that maybe there was some kind of interference in Tennessee. But one day I plugged them into my TV, and I got the same break in transmission. The moral to the story: this product does not work well with some electronics. I am not sure why.Apart from that, they are okay. There is the hiss and pop that others have complained about, that increases with distance from the base. But from fairly close it is minimal, and I find it is cool for watching movies on my computer. So overall I give it 3 stars."
2,Died after 7 months,"Very convenient to watch TV or play video games at night, but after 7 months, it randomly stopped working. Even tested it with two different sets of rechargeable batteries. It just died on me. Never fell asleep with them, it was always docked at the same spot, never used it for 3 hours straight, and I never left it on accidentally all night.Re-did the plugs, AC adapter, and any other way of resetting/re-installing. Just died I guess.Going to go with the new SONY PS3 Headset, but still need to find a new wireless headset for TV purposes.You get what you pay for. Must be a reason it's half off now."
1,Buzz Not Acceptable,"From the beginning I had problems with these headphones.First, the left side was noticably louder than the right. However, I liked the phones in other respects (comfy, good sound), so I kept them for another 4 months.Then, a new problem appeared that I could not ignore: the left side developed a loud BUZZ.No way could I continue to use these. I returned them to Amazon for a [partial] refund. I did not want another set. I'll probably try SONY next."
1,No good,There is no way to use these headphones with aSamsung plasma HD TV. I didn't return them because I thought they could be connected so now I'm stuck with looking at them on the charger.
1,Poor Quality,My brother had an older model that is no longer available and I liked it for overall quality so I ordered this model thinking I would have the same equipment. The quality of this model was very disappointing. The headphones do not fit properly and if you move around they will fall off your head. The sound quality is not good. You cannot get the static out of the headphone sound even with constant tinkering with the tune control. The reception is poor when you move more than twenty feet from the transmitter. The unit does work if you don't mind the background static. I suggest not buying this model due to the cheap quality. I am disappointed in Sennheiser.
2,For Computer,"Ok. Bought with high expectations. Opened the packaging, charged for 24 hrs. Got home, turned on the tv and the headphones. Nothing. Thought maybe it's a lemon. So tried it with computer. Worked perfectly. Ending to story. It did not work with my tv. Wish it had a compatability list showing which tv's it didn't work with. Feel ripped off. But eh, I have some nice Computer headphones."
5,Wireless Headphones with charging unit,"Excellent design and quality built. You can use it in the home or charge it up and take it out to use. My son in law loves it and uses it all the time, keeps exterior noise out as well."
5,I'm a happy camper!,"I bought them for my husband who has trouble hearing what people are saying on the television. He turns the volume up and I cover my ears and say ""it's too loud"". But now with his new tv ears, he can control the volume for himself and I can enjoy watching a movie without having my ears being blasted! I highly recommend them."
4,Fantastic headphones,"I bought this headphone set for my mother-in-law, who is moving into an Assisted Living Facility. She is almost deaf and with poor eyesight. I didn't know if she was going to like wearing headphones at age 96 but, to my surprise, she LOVES these. For the first time in well over a year, she can comfortably sit and hear the TV without having it blarring at maximun volume and driving everyone else out of their minds. I would have scored this set 5 stars except for one thing, that's probably no trouble for most peoplem and that is the TUNE wheel, which is located just below the VOLUME control on the right headpiece. Her little arthritic fingers have a problem finding those wheels and, if she inadvertently moves the Tune wheel, she loses video and has to have someone help her get it back. Other than that, they are really GREAT."
4,life improving,"I love the wireless feature. comerical comes on I jump up and get something done ie fillup washer, clear table of dishes, take out trash and I always know when the show is back on. the only downfall of this Item is when you bend over the headphones slip right off your head. I solved this by wearing a baseball type cap with a bill. Of course while I watch my Tv I hear everything more clearly and family can listen to thier music or chat on phone and it doesn't bother me, or them."
5,Great Value,"I picked this over the lower model for the built in stand/charger, it was a gift for my father so he can watch tv when other people are in the house doing things, hes a bit def and these work wonderfully for him, he can hear the tv and the rest of us can talk and cook or whatever without him getting all Donald duck mad that he cant hear whats going on on the tv."
2,Consider something else...,"You might want to consider something else. I bought this in Oct 2008. By mid 2009 it was beginning to fail: static heard once in a while, one side or the other would stop working then come back, recharging took longer & length of use decreased as time progressed. Then in the spring of 2010 it died altogether. The head piece was comfortable, but loose fitting. The sound quality was ok but I think my Inke'd ear buds to my mp3 player sound better. The cordless convenience was wonderful, but I really expected these to last MUCH longer than they did. I don't think it's worth the $69.89 price. Over all I'm not happy with the quality or durability the Sennheiser brand lead me to expect, especially for this price range. I recommend you buy something else or cough up for the replacement warranty cause I think you'll need it."
3,too loose; fall off head,"Generally happy with these, but they slip off when I bend over (and I have a very big head). The foam is flat where it intersects the ear, so there is no ridge to go around the ears and keep them in place. I will probably come up with a home-made fix for this, but it is annoying. The sound is decent for the price. Really good sounding headphones cost more, even for wired. UPDATE: Still quite annoyed with looseness. Lowering to three stars."
3,It's not as good as I expected!,Noice wise it's OK in general. The volumes at both ears are not equivalent. In other words the tuning of earhone gets different result between two ears.
4,Works Great!,"I am impressed with the quality of the sound that I get from this product. I have long been troubled with being unable to understand what people are saying on TV and have tried different speaker systems with minimal success and have had to use hearing aids and the ""closed Caption"" feature to watch many shows. This system has corrected all that. I no longer wear hearing aids or used ""CC"" while watching TV and rarely have a problem hearing everything that is being said so it is worth every penny I paid for it. The only reason for the 4 star rating is that the headphones fit so loosely that when i bend over they fall off my head I have no problems with loosing the sound when going into other rooms in the house."
4,Hearing,Good product but could have more comfortable ear cups. The cups are flat and press on the ears. Over all I like them very much. It is nice because I can mute the TV and use the head set so my wife can read while I watch TV.
3,Attach to Sony Bravia,"Not able to review, the Sennheiser RS12 is not capable of being connected to a Sony Bravia Home theater surround system. It can only connect via RCA connection."
1,They hurt to wear and they make noise,"I don't like headphones that press on your ears. These do. It is impossible to tune them to perfect reception. There's always some background noise. Also, the volume and tuning nob are RIGHT next to each other, so you inadvertently turn the wrong one and all of a sudden its screaming in your ears ""AR-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE."" Very relaxing."
4,As expected,"These headphones have performed as expected. The sound is good enough, not great, and as others have commented, sometimes the connection will suddenly drop, and you will be treated to a burst of static. Again, as others have noted, the headphones start to get uncomfortable after a half hour or so, but perhaps this is true of all such headphones."
4,Excellent wireless headphone,"This headphone works pretty good.Just a few notes of concern but frankly not anything major:The headset is little loose because it's a little too big.when there is no signal, you will get noise if you keep the headset on.The base is very light and tips sometimes when I lift the headset.Now the good side:for a wireless it produces very good sound.I keep the headphones on and go room to room without any problem or interference. Sometimes I have it on for seven eight hours without batteries running out. Batteries are standard AAA size rechargeable.If I had choice, would I buy it again?You bet."
5,More than satisfied!,"Earphones received in time promised and in excellent condition. When hooked up as described by instructions, no problem. They work beautifully can walk all-around my condo and not lose the signal. The sound is tops with good bass. Glad I bought them. Would recommend them to anyone.Irvis46"
4,Recommend the 130s for Music,"I bought the 120s after looking at all three versions (120, 130 and 140) of these head phones and I regret not spending the extra $30 for the 130's. A coworker has the 130's and they really sound better. They both sound good but the 130's sound more natural and have slightly deeper tones. Also, the 120's are Over the ear instead of Around the ear, although they are very comfortable for over the ear. The only reason this is 4 star though is because of the sound difference. Other than that, these are excellent head phones... I don't think I'll ever buy anything other than Sennheiser now."
2,Great Sound but too big & unconfortable,"I loved the sound I heard with this headphones. It's superb.But it's too big to wear. Forget trying to wear while you are half lying in the bed at night and watch TV, which was the whole point of buying this headset so that no one is disturbed while you watch TV at night.Put you head against pillow and it will pop out of place. So I tried my recliner but same outcome.I guess it's fine if you are standing while you watch TV or if you are listening to music only while walking around your house.And if your head is of average size, you are out of luck, there is no way to tighten it, you bend down & it slides out of place. You need bigger head that will make it work fine I guess."
4,Great for the office!,"Comfort supreme. Sound is transparent and full at lower volumes (on the headset). Perfect for the office environment. They don't ""CRANK"" without hiss, but for enjoyig music in your cube they are perfect. The sound quality is superb. All the suckers that bought ""noise supressing"" cans, after listening to these, wonder how the Senheiser RS120's were under 60 bucks. Open air baby. No need for that closed headphone crap unless you are a D.J. or on a flight. It all depends on what want to hear, the real thing, or some muffled equilized dung ball."
2,Did not fit our needs,"Although not in the specificatlons or description of the product, it doesn't work with a plasma TV. After working to set it up for over an hour, finally went to the web to find this out."
2,Very disappointed,"I was looking forward to having wireless headphones while going about my daily chores around the house in the garden and on casual walks. I find that while they are comfortable, they don't stay on my head. When I bend down they fall forward, I am constantly adjusting them, more troublesome than the wires that I was trying to avoid.The quality of the sound when it is tuned properly is good however as you move around there are frequent blasts of static that are totally unacceptable. I guess it would be ok if you put them on and sat in a chair and didn't move. I didn't have that in mind when I bought them, I could do that with my earbuds."
2,Old technology,This item is an outdated piece of dog poop you have to zone in on the tuning for the radio speaker and every time you move you get static it is an outdated piece of technology which doesn't deserve to be on the market today.
1,Too many flaws !,This product has too many flaws! The worst being that you could easily hear people talk while you have them on!
1,Not chargeable,"It did not work for me.Experience was good until first attempt to charge headphones.All attempts to put book on top , change angle , etc, did not give positive result."
3,Okay.,"The headset looks good and has good sound quality, but battery charge does not last very long. There is some static initially noticed. Limited distance range from the base."
1,Dont buy.,This product was not good as it was very loose on the head / ears. The headphones dropped when you looked down.
2,Freedom & Fuzz,"I've had these for about a month now and have used them every day. I walk all over my house with them (3800 sq ft) and down to the mailbox, but there is a loud ""shhhh"" all the time. I have to adjust the tuner to an in-between, mono, not-as-much-volume-available place in order to hear stuff. (Like when you pull the headphone plug out half-way.) I listen to a lot of audiobooks & talk-radio, but lots of music too. I read several reviews before buying these, and no one complained much about the noisy background. On a plus side, you've got no wires and I wear them for hours without my ears hurting. BTW, I have kind-of a small head and the smallest setting on them is still loose. I can't look down or they'll fall off. Grand Total: I wouldn't buy them again."
5,wireless headphones,"Sennheiser headphones perform as advertised. Superb sound, very convenient to use, no interference anywhere in the house. If you are considering buying TVEars, don't."
2,"Not impressed, considering the price","The sound quality was the same as a $20 pair I bought 2 years ago. I was expecting more. The cheap ones (bought at W%al M%art online) still work, I just needed another pair for the office, and I thought I would move up. Both have good reception and good audio. If you start out with a more expensive pair, you won't have any complaints, but you'll never know that you could have gotten the same quality sound for $20."
3,Sennheiser makes the grade but fall off your head,The Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones met and exceeded my expectations except for one small problem. They wont stay on your head. Anytime you have to even slightly bend over they fall off. There isnt enough tension in the headphones to hold them on your head. You have to more or less balance them on your head.
1,Lasted 4 months,"Poorly designed. I enjoyed these headphones -- until the AA batteries located in the left earphone began to corrode. The very porous foam of the ear cup sits directly on the batteries and terminals, allowing moisture (sweat, humidity, etc.) to damage the batteries. VERY disappointed. I finally trashed them after four months."
3,There hot !,"The head phones have good sound but they fit kind of loose and are warmer than I would like. I bought these for using on elliptical machine, no go, to hot and they slipped down. If you where looking for something to where for short periods of time watching tv they would be ok otherwise I wouldn't recommend them!"
3,good performance but limited life,I've had 2 of the RS 120's and the base unit has gone out on both. One after 2 yrs. and the other after 3 weeks. However I haven't found any other brands with as good performance. I've upgraded to the RS140 so I'll see how long that lasts.
2,Base unit shuts off after few minutes,The unit works great... until it shuts off 3 minutes later! The Sennheiser website says that the output level of the TV (or whatever else you plugged it into) is too low. Not true! The headphones work just fine while it lasts. I plugged them into the cable box and they worked fine without interruption. But there is nothing wrong with the TV audio output! Poor engineering.
2,"They are ok, not great","First of all, these headphones amplify the sound. You cannot have your TV on mute and listen through the headphones as you can with some makes.I bought this product 6 months ago and I thought about returning it immediately because sound was only coming from one side. However, the problem seemed to be fixed after some tweaking so I kept them. Randomly, however, there is a loud crackling noise and the sound disappears. After 6 months, the headphones only work some of the time. I will not buy them again. I did expect a better product from Sennheiser."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a functional wireless headphone but apparently a 60 bucks headphone is too cheap to do just that. This headphone has a LOT of static noise at close range (I've experienced with all different frequency band). Not only is there static noise, the wavelength disturbance is very obvious as you move away from the transmitter. I don't think this headphone is worth the money, it's pretty bad. I am just too lazy to return it..."
4,good product,"bought these for my wife, so she could listen to TV while I snored. benefit for me is I can fall asleep and not be kept up by TV noise. now if she could just dim the TV. Wife's only complaint is that the headphones don't block out outside noise completely, but she's happy with them."
4,Headset review,"This headset system does what it is intended to do, improve listening to the TV. Biggest problem is that if you move around at all the headset does not stay put, but tends to fall off. Also it is hard to find the volume controlwithout taking the headset off."
1,FED UP.... BUYER BEWARE,"I would think twice before buying anything more from Sennheiser. I am a gadget hound. I purchased their headsets and, frankly they worked great, for about 3 weeks before they stopped working. I contacted the customer service organization, I sent them my headsets and base for repair, 4 weeks later, they sent me a brand new headset. *** THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY NEVER RETURNED THE BASE ***. I've contacted them 6 times so far. One of the times they said they were going to return the base to me but they never responded after that (no base was sent). It has now been close to 10 months... and multiple attempts to contact them... no replies... no base... wish I kept my money (plenty of other options out there.) I am writing this review after being kept on hold for 59 minutes on their customer service line."
4,wireless for the bedroom,"these were very easy to hook up and, although a little sensitive, once they are dialed in, the sound is nice. my wife actually prefers to listen to her shows on the headphones versus the tv sound system. good price, great delivery ( amazon prime ). I recommend these highly."
4,Wonderful sound,"These headphones lived up to my expectations. The sound quality is amazing, range is as advertised. Perfect for watching tv after my roommates have gone to bed."
1,Outdated design and poor function,"I just received these today and after 5 minutes I knew I had to return them. I will keep it simple and list the reasons why.1. They are HUGE. I felt like I should be walking on the airport tarmac parking commercial aircraft.2. The sound quality is HORRIBLE, buzz, hiss and very tinny sounding.3. The design is over 7 yrs old which is a millennium in electronics ( I should have paid closer attention to the review dates)."
2,stopped working after 2 weeks,The unit stopped working after 2 weeks of light use. Quality control seems to be a problem with this unit/manufacturer.
2,Not Very Good,"After several months of using, here are my thoughts: the headphones are VERY warm. Your ears will be kept warm. If you work in a meat locker, this is good. Normal temperatures, not so good. Also, I get a LOT of feedback from them. The base is 3 feet away and up no a shelf, but the static and noise is pretty bad. When I occasionally get a clear signal (not often), the sound is average. They are plugged in to my computer and there is nothing else electronic nearby to cause the issues. Also, after a few seconds of no content (for example, stopping a streaming radio program) you get a loud buzz.The range seems to be decent (40-50 feet, consistently), but quickly fades with walls and windows.I would not recommend these headphones."
3,"Good, but...","The sound on these headphones is very good. And the fact that they are RF instead of infrafed means I can walk around the house and the sound travels through the walls. Distance through walls is between 50 and 100 feet. Controls on the headphones work fine. The only thing I don't like about them is they sit on top of your ears. While they look like they might have the traditional cups that cover your ears,the inside of the ear pieces is completely flat and hard. This means they slide off your head very easily. So, when laying on the couch it's a little difficult to keep them on. I've never had any problems with battery life and the input automatically adjusts to line or headphone outputs so it will connect to any receiver that has a reasonably common output."
3,Great Company to do Business With,"No fault of the Sellers, but the item did not work (I personally believe this was the manufacturer's problem). That being said, when it was time to return the item the Seller was right there. They were friendly, understood the problem and refunded our purchase price in its entirety. Obviously, this Seller has a wonderful reputation and knows how to deal with problems. I would readily purchase an item from them again. Additonally, Amazon contacted the Seller immediately to resolve this issue.Thanks to Ace Photo and Digital and Amazon were are satisfied."
3,Poor Amazon-Affiliate relationship,The Sennheiser wireless worked far better than top competitor Sony. The headset I received was apparenly a second - the headset had been stretched so large that Andre the Giant couldn't keep in on his head. There was no way to get a replacement headset.
1,Sennheizer review,"I have only had these headphones for 3 weeks and they work great. The only problem I'm having is that I have another set of Sennheizer headphones and when both TVs are on, they interfere (even after changing frequencies)."
1,"Junk, don't buy them","These headphones are incredibly cheap, poorly constructed, and worthless. I just threw them across the room. They won't stay on your head. They are finicky about staying on. The sound quality is terrible, full of barely audible hiss and rumble. I can't believe anyone can give these a good review, they are crap! They come with two RCA plugs for some reason, when I put the RCA's into the headphone jack of my computer, they fit so loosley that I had to fiddle with them to get sound"
3,OK but not great,Wireless headphones are a great way to avoid disturbing a sleeping partner while watching TV. I connected my headphones to the audio output of my DISH receiver with no problems. Generally the sound is great but there are a few glitches. When I leave the room I often get some ear popping static which is unpleasant. I've also noticed that occasionally the base seems to interfere with my DISH reception. If I wiggle the wires I can usually fix the problem. Maybe the problem is with my DISH receiver but I expected the headphones to work better.
5,Great convenience!,"This heaphones work great and help you have the flexibility you need. Finally we can watch the same show, music or movie with a different volume level. the sound is crisp enough vs. the convenience of having it cordless. obviuosly there is some static but you wont notice it unless there is absolute silence in what you are hearing, and it is barely noticeable to the untrained ear, though. I would definitely buy them again if I had the chance."
5,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz,A gift for an elderly lady with signifficant hearing loss. She loves it. Now she doesn't have to read the spoken word. This replaced an older system that really didn't do the job for her. She has all ready recommended it to friends.
4,Does the job,"Bought this item a few months ago because I tend to stay up late and my partner is finishing her dissertation and needs quiet sometimes.It's worked great! There were a number of mixed reviews, so I was unsure. I've been happily surprised by how well it's worked - so much so I felt compelled to write this review (first ever).If you're looking for wireless headphones that will allow you to listen to TV, music, or the radio without disturbing someone, these will do the job nicely."
4,RS 120 Headphones,"Great sound and true quality built into these headphones.Little disappointed in the comfort. They tend to want to ""SQUEEZE"" your ears, resulting in a painful feeling. Advertised as ear-cups. But ear-cups fit over and completely around the ear, never actually touching or pressing on the ears. These have a cup in the middle, but it's way too small to fit around your ear. The result is after a few hours of wearing these headphones, you want to take them off and give your ears a rest."
1,Garbage,I should have looked at the over 100 1 star reviews. My unit never even turned on when I plugged it in. You have a green on/off light and a red charging light. The red light came on when I put the headphones on the cradle but the transmitter never turned on so obviously no sound. This item is going back.
1,The don't work,"Sennheiser is supposed to be a top brand in this type of equipment and since my hearing is not that good anymore, I thought that this would be the solution. This set worked great for the first week, from that point, I don't get anything but static, and was unable to ""tune"" them. The headset doesn't fit correctly into the charging stand and misses the contacts to keep it charged, and it required constant adjustment or the batteries wouldn't charge. I recently tried to switch to regular batteries, but with the same results...static.My wife threw out the packing, when it first came in so I couldn't send this purchase back. It's about the worst $80 purchase I've ever made, and my wife is getting tired of me always asking ""what did they say?"""
1,Totally disappointed about this hedset!,"I own other 3 wired headset from Sennheiser and one NoName/""cheep"" wireless headset.Being so happy with my other Sennheiser headsets I bought this product hoping to improve my wireless experience but after one minute of use I was totally disappointed.Quality of sound and reception is really bad, i can't turn my head without losing reception and I can't go more fare then 5m away from my TV, a lot of background noise and the headset can't reproduce lower frequencies of sound.They are really uncomfortable, my ears hurts after use them and they got terrible hot and if I move fast my head the headsets fall down.Now I'm back to my old wireless headset which are much more better then this ones.Shame on you Sennheiser for this headsets!!!"
2,Bad Hissing and Loose Fit.,"Don't nod your head yes or no, because they will fall off. Don't wear them more than 5 mins without listening to anything, because ONLY the transmitter turns off, your headphone are still on, and you hear nothing but static. Just bad design over all, and I will not buy another wireless headset from Sennheiser unless they fix these problems."
1,Horrible design flaw wipes out anything positive I have to say,"These have to be the worst designed headphones I've ever purchased. Unless you have a head that is sized and shaped perfectly for these, expect them to slip and fall off at the slightest tilt. Both my husband and I use these and it is horribly frustrating when you need to reach for something or move about and have these slide off your head. I dont understand how these have gotten such high reviews. On a positive note, the charging cradle is great because Ive owned other wireless headphones and it was always a pain setting them down just right to get a charge but that is small consolation when having to deal with these falling off all the time. They are EXTREMELY expensive considering their quality and design flaws. I would have expected something leather-like which might have provided better grip. Instead, you have some sort of cheap foamy material. Do not buy!"
4,Pleased,"Overall I am happy with this product. I tested the range, and I was able to walk about what the range says it is. (However at farther distances there is more static.) I noticed that with computer use, particularly my mac, it is important to have the computer volume down and the headset volume up. This makes a big difference on sound quality. I also found it helpful to put the headphone port at a central part of my apartment and at a higher location. Don't expect perfectly wonderful sound quality. I do not know how achievable this is over a wireless connection. One downside is that the sound from the headphones leaks out a bit to others nearby. In general, I am happy to have made this purchase and would do the same again."
1,Problem child,"I have another Sennheiser corded stereo headset. Great headset HD450II. This headset will not stay on my head unless I am froze in my seat. I know Sennheiser can do better than this headset. Great sound easy to use, great way to charge the headset, just that the headset is not what I thought it would be. I have considered returning for a refund! So far I have not done so!"
3,great headphones for the money,The headphones are a great valve my only issue is the hissing sound it has sometimes other than that thay are a great buy I even bought a second one for my wife to use if you have kids this is a must have overall this is a great buy thanks
4,Cowboy,A very nice product a little spendy but it is saving my ears. I do not have to shout over the tv anymore. Also a good range on far they can go before you lose signal. Overal a good buy would be exelent if could get for a cheaper price.
1,Huge mistake,"The headphones worked perfectly the first time I used them. Put them back on the cradle to charge. The next time I went to use them, all I got was hissssss. Called Sennheiser. The problem was everything under the sun ... but the headphones: I didn't have the volume turned up loud enough, I apparently was incompetent to scan through the dial from one end to the other, I didn't have them plugged in correctly, blah blah BS! BS! blah! Was told to return the product; would be 2 to 3 weeks turnaround for either repair or replace. I shipped them to Sennheiser. No word if they ever received them. No word if there's a prognosis. No word if there's going to be a fix. No word if and when I might get them back. No word, period! Communication sucks! I emailed them, got a generic reply stating that it would be 4 weeks turnaround. If you're thinking you're getting these at a good price, tack on an extra $9.35 cost to ship them back to Sennheiser."
5,Sounds great for what it is; range is somewhat limited,"This is a great wireless headphone. I originally bought the 180 model from Amazon and found it to be absolutely no better than this unit...except for its range.The 120 has a very limited area in which it picks up sounds from its base. In my house (older home; plaster walls; well built), it begins to snap, crackle and pop 30 feet or less from its base (and my listening room). This works for me; for the MUCH better price than the 180, I can tolerate a bit less range.Well satisfied with this unit. While others may get 100-200 feet from the base station, I can't. However, overall I highly recommend it."
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited to purchase these well reviewed headphones. Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with them- static was a major problem and the range for tuning in the television station was small. Sadly, the static and background noise were too loud and rendered dialogue impossible to hear. We returned them immediately (I will say that Amazon customer service was excellent) as they did not perform as advertised."
4,Very Good Sound,"I am very hard of hearing and I have gone through two sets of TV EARS. The fault is mine as I fall asleep and weaken the conection between the ear piece and the receiver. I ordered SENNHEISER headphones as the looked to be sturdier and they are. The sound is very good, and I was surprised to get stereo from our T.V. I would recommend to anyone hard of hearing or anyone who did not want to disturb their spouse. The only negative thing I have to make is the back ground music is louder than normal."
4,No volume control for both ears.,"This model does NOT have a separate volume control for each ear. Seems louder in my left ear where the volume control is located. Wish I could get the volume in the right ears louder, so it would be balanced."
4,Good listening,Pros: Great headphones for the price. Worked right out of the box. Good sound. Charges battery's very well.Cons: They fit a little loose on your head and slide off when bending over.
2,Sennheiser RS120,"The wireless did not work for me. I had static coming through the headset. I tried the three different channels available with the system. I had to return the headphones. If it wasn't for the static the sound quality and Bass is very good. However, I could not eliminate the static in the background and had to return the product. The return service is great. Will shop again from the seller through Amazon."
4,Good all round solution to peace and privacy,"I am happy with the Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with charging cradle.It has most of the attributes I need except for max comfort of the earphones. I would prefer them to be cupped around the ears instead of lying flat. Ofcourse this would seal out the sound and I prefer to hear what is going on around me and not be absolutely isolated. But they don't feel as secure on my head as I would like, just a bit flat across the top of my head (and I don't have a pointy one!)You have to be careful to put the earphones on the charger correctly. Their weight on the charger has to be just right, showing the red light. It will go green when charged. I have two pairs and I like that you only have to charge one to have the other one function at the same time.The sound is crystal clear with not too much bass. I only use them for TV so far."
5,Great Product!!,My wife has a problem hearing spoken voices on TV and she loves these. She tells me they fit well and are very comfortable.
1,"Wow, really dreadful","This is my first ever review after a decade w/ Amazn, so I am needless to say *very* disappointed. I just need to second++ the previous complaints about needing to have the TV volume up. I am not an over the top audiophile, I just want something passable. When I read the reviews saying that the volume needed to be turned up, I had not imagined that the problem would be so dramatic; if my tv volume is not full 100%, the WAH-WAH-SCRATCH is unbearably bad. At that volume, if I ever unplug the headphone jack w/o turning the volume down I will probably blow my speakers. This is simply unacceptable, and I am returning them.That said, there may be hope for some of you; if your tv has a ""line out"" (for going to a computer or sound system) instead of a just headphone out, it *may* work OK there. My guess is that the people who are happy with the unit have a situation like this. Sadly I don't, I only have digital optical out (too high end) and headphone jack (too low tech)."
3,Malfunction in under one year,"We have purchased two sets of these headphones, both for relatives who have trouble hearing the television. The first pair has been in frequent use for over two years and still works well (and it is GREAT not to constantly have to answer the question, ""What did he say?"" while watching TV). The second set was purchased for a relative whom we subsequently discovered did not have a compatible TV (not sure why, as it is a relatively new set), so it has stayed at our house and has had infrequent use when our hard of hearing guests are here (or occasionally for late night TV watching, which is also nice). This second set has now malfunctioned twice; the charger simply stops working, has no power. A week or so later, it has started working again. Review of the warranty policy indicates we would have to pay for shipping if we wanted even a shot at getting it repaired/replaced, and given the moderate price of the headphones, I don't think it's likely worth it."
2,"Leak a LOT of noise, uncomfortable.","The reviews were kind of confusing so I decided to go for them. It was a bad choice. I sent them back the second day. The sound quality is not good. It leaks a LOT of noise. I was listening to music at work (moderate volume) and my colleague who was sitting 4 feet away from me could hear everything loud and clear. He complained about the disturbance. Also, they make your ears really warm and sweaty to the point when it becomes really uncomfortable around the ears. I would not recommend them to anybody. I just hope Amazon returns my money without any problems."
4,Only two quibbles,"This is our second set of Sennheisers. We had our first set for almost ten years, after which we had some battery issues.These are great. Long battery life, and they don't take proprietary batteries like our old set.One complaint is that the tuner and volume knobs are too close together. I imagine we'll get used to that.Worse is the shape of the earpieces--they're flat. This means they slide off your head if you look down. Not a problem for couch potatoes, but I wear them to listen to the news while making dinner because the TV is not within view of the kitchen. I'm considering gluing a ring of foam on the earpieces.Other than this, we love our Sennheisers."
1,Problems from the start,I got a pair of these 2 years ago because a person at work had them and swore by them. I have had problems since I got them and now they have just died. I would have to wiggle the plug to get any sound out. They picked up my coworkers stations but not mine even though we were on different channels. Lot's of noise so had to re-fiddle with it always. If you didn't have any sound playing loud static would come on after 5 min. I am looking for another pair now but won't be getting these ones again.
3,No way to connect to Sony Bravia Home theater Systems,"I bought a Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones recently and I have not been able toconnect it to Sony Bravia Home theater Systems which does not have a headphone jack or RCA typy audio out. I have connected it to my Bravia TV that has RCA audio out, but can not get the sound when using the home theater unit.I would have thought that Sennheiser would have updated its products to keep up with technology!"
1,wireless headphones,They didn't work. Only got static so I sent them back. Instructions weren't good and I didn't get any help from the maker. They just said to read the help section on the website which was not any help either.
3,hearing and privacy assistance,"Product duz provide adequate reception from TV, little bulky, do love the privacy with my ears on. Adjustment controls are clunkie and cheap, but then what can one expect for $70, it works. Should have spent more for a better product. Maybe next time"
4,Wireless Earphones,I just want to say that Amazon.com is a class act. I will continue to shop on Amazon's site.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I got these for Christmas (yesterday) and talk about bad - these things are horrible. There is constant static in the background and if there is no sound for only a few seconds, the system shuts down. Take my word on this - just say no!"
1,sound only in left channel,"The sound quality is actually pretty good. However, I'm only getting sound on the left channel, so I'm sending this back. I tried it on my TV and stereo system, and had same problem with both systems. When I tried a wired headphone, heard sound from both channels, so it's pretty clear my TV and stereo are working fine."
5,What a great find!,"I just love these headphones - My Wife just loves that I have them - she feels like it was an early Christmas gift for her.I am using these for my television - she was so tierd of my having the ""noise"" going all of the time. This has been a great relief for us both. Ease of use is great - controls right on the phones and the recharge is so simple just rest them in the stand - no plug to worry with - great battery life - good range around the house or out to the car or deck. They are not uncomfortable to wear and you can still hear instructions from the wife or the phone or door bell.I have not yet used them for music - they seem to be of a high quality sound technology so I am expecting that I will be just as impressed with the music capability as well. I am thinking about getting a splitter switch to connect my receiver as well."
1,Very Disappointed,"I had realistic expectations of my new headphones. Big disappointment with the fit. I bought these for watching/listening to t.v., while I cleaned the house. They wouldn't stay on my head! The ear pads are flat and don't provide any grip on your ears. Everytime I bent over, they slid off. I don't have a small head, and a friend with a big head tried them, and the same thing happened to him. Adjustment options were minimal. Reception was also spotty through my walls, reaching a high pitch screech at times. I packed them up today and am expecting a replacement headphone from a different company. Yeah, I don't recommend these headphones. I am disappointed and just plain annoyed with the hassle of dealing with the return."
3,Sennheiser RS120 was missing the charger,I know the product is very good (I have one) however this time the charger was not included. This purchase was a present. I wonder if the charger can be sent to my address. The present was sent abroad.
1,cant hitch it up. whete do you put red and black,I cannot make sense of the directions. they say put the red plug in the area marked r. But not where black plug goes. I have triedevery configuration no sound in ears.
2,Serously not comfotable. Poor disign all around.,"I have had these about 2 hours. Easy to set up. The sound is good.They are not comfortable. They fit is exceptionally loose with no grip for your head. Turning your head means you will be wearing them on your face and not your ears.The ""tune"" is right next to the volume so I have screwed it up quite a few times. Just adjusting the headphones. The volume doesn't go that loud.Don't buy these they suck."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I purchased these headphones during the Christmas season to replace a set of ""TV Ears"" that function identically to these headphones. I wanted to upgrade to better quality but was sadly dissapointed when I got nothing but static from this set. The hookup was identical to TV Ears so there was no doubt they just didn't work. When I returned them to Amazon I could have asked for a replacement but the plastic base appeared to be so cheaply made (light plastic) that I decided not to bother. All in all I would say Quality Control on this product is poor and I would expect more problems from them in the future."
1,Poor quality,"It worked for about 3 hours, after which the base unit would not stay powered on and would not re-charge the headset. I retuned it. Very disappointed and unexpected from Sennheiser, who otherwise has a reputation for quality audio products."
1,"terrible item, used once and already broke in 1 month","I bought the item this Sep, used once, which was already broken on Nov, I was too busy to even go get returned/fixed but pretty pissed about wasting $70 for a piece of junk. I don't usually write any reviews but to just warn you not to repeat same mistake i made."
4,Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones,"I am extremely happy with this product. A friend bought one for his wife as Christmas gift and both recommended it. It is everything it is advertized to be. I am very hard of hearing, even with expensive hearing aids I could not really understand video dialog. The RS120 Wireless is the answer. Difference between night and day."
4,Fantastic Wireless headphones,"These headphones are far superior to other brands we have tried. You can move about the house, and even step outside with no interruption to the sound. My husband can now listen to his shows while the rest of the house is quiet. Great for those sleepless nights."
5,Can't Use an Audio/Optical Cable,"I'm happy with the product, however there is NO WAY you can use an optical/audio that Amazon advertises along side the product as ""frequently used together"". I hope Amazon can drop this false advertising with the headphones."
4,Almost 5 stars,"Like others have said, these are great sounding headphones. I didn't realize my TV could sound so good until I got these. They far outshine my deafult TV speakers. Also, yes the tune dial is right next to the volume like others have said, which can cause annoyance at first, but once you get used to it no problem. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is they tend to get some interferance and are sensitive. I think for the money they are excellent and I am generally very happy."
3,nice but big,These are great for my husband who likes the TV volume loud. The headphones are quite large ... great for him but not so good for someone with a smaller head.
1,Sad,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser and being a fan, I know alot about them. I bought two of them one after another, hoping that I would get the quality as they promise, I know its big in size and I don't care, I dont care if it needs to be plugged in, but the only thing I wanted is quality. I was busy with my studies, but it's high time I spoke of it. I like sennheiser, but I don't like this product. Stop producing !"
2,"Limited Use,","These headphones didnt even work for me, but i did figure out that it only works for watching tv, nothing else, plus the directions are limited. I dont suggest this, but hey, why not give it a try"
3,Beware the incomplete item description,"I just received these phones, and for some reason, they don't ship with the 3.5 mm headphone jack and 6.3 mm adaptor as pictured in the pdf manual, but rather with a paired RCA cable attached, and no adaptor of any kind. These were useless to me with my current stereo."
1,Worst headphone ever,The headphones didn't work as described. They loose the TV signal every time I used them and are really uncomfortable. They are worthless; please don't even think to buy them
4,"Great for TV, but don't expect classical listening","There is a white noise hiss in the background that is easy to filter out if you're watching TV or something that the sound is not mission critical, but if you are listening to a classical CD it will drive you nuts.Also, if you have a large head (like me) it's difficult to leave the headphones adjusted AND fit easily on the charging rack. I have to finesse it a little bit every time.All in all, for my purposes these are great. I don't have to worry about the dog ripping the receiver off the shelf and my wife doesn't have to listen to my tv shows."
4,"High price, but good quality","Hi,I've been searching around the internet and am able to find these headphones starting around $59 (not including shipping).I am almost ready to purchase, and last monday Amazon's price was $59.something. I had everything in the cart and ready to buy, when the price jumped to $79. I then stopped my order and checked froogle.com for prices elsewhere. It is true that other stores sell them for less. So, why the amazon price jump?I've notified amazon that their price is higher than others and will wait a few days to see if they lower it again back to what it originally was.Just a warning about the price.Sincerely,me"
1,hiss and interference problems. spontaneously switches off,"These headphones were very prone to hiss and interference from nearby electronic equipment. However the thing that makes these impossible to use is if you are listening to nothing (playlist ends) for five minutes or so, the headphones don't switch off but instead switch to a mode where they deafeningly blast static into your ears. Makes this product practically unusable."
4,Wireless headset meets most expectations,"The instructions could be clearer, but it functions well once properly connected. The sound quality is very good. The headset could be more comfortable. The range is very good. Overall 4 plus stars."
1,Too bulky and was returned,"These headsets were way too bulky to be comfortable. The cradle was flimsy and headsets kept falling off. These may be good for certain people, but we definitely did not like them and returned them. Amazon was wonderful about handling the return. I do a lot of business with Amazon, and this was one of the very few things I have ordered that did not work out."
1,Kinda crappy,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas and at first he liked them, although he said the sound quality wasn't that great. He had high hopes and really liked the charging dock, but as he wore them doing chores around the house, he found that they didn't fit well and fell off easily due to the flatness of the headphone pads. The third time he wore them, the on/off button broke. Compared to the Radio Shack headphones that we had for 5 years, these were horrible. Their sound was superior and the only reason we replaced them was because the headphone cover would no longer stay on. I guess I'm going back to Radio Shack."
3,Not the quality I expected from Sennheiser,"I own a number of pairs of Sennheiser headphones, most of them in the $20-$50 range. When I purchased these $100+ headphones from them I expected to be blown away with the quality. Instead, they sound and feel worse than the cheaper wired pairs I already own. They are not horrible, and I do want a pair of wireless headphones, so I'll be keeping them, but I would say these headphones are just ""OK""."
2,doesn't work at all,"These are decent enough headphones. They sound good although I detect a slight hiss. I didn't find them uncomfortable at all although they can slip off when I tilt my head too far forward. However, I can't use them at work at all. There is a constant rhythmic clicking even when no audio signal is present. I have tried to track down the source of interference but to no avail. It is not my computer, monitor or telephone as I have tried powering all these down. I tried tuning on all three channels. The online FAQ is of no help. As work is where I intended to use them, they are useless to me. Bottom line: they work acceptably well some places but not everywhere. Be forewarned that they may not work at all where you need them. The Sony headphones, also 900 mHz, do not have this problem although the reception is not as good."
4,Sennheiser wireless headphones: Model RS 120.,"Top-notch product, like Sennheiser products usually are. Extremely sensitive to other nearby electronic objects and wireless devices(when they are operating. Examples: TV, Xbox, DVD Player, laptop with wireless Internet). The sound quality makes up for it though, and plus you can't expect perfection with wireless headphones. If you do not like sitting close to your TV and need a pair of affordable headphones, I would recommend these. Of course these are some of the lower priced headphones from Sennheiser. If you've got the extra money I'd suggest you increase your price range beyond these."
2,"Good, I guess!","I am not really a connoisseur of fine headphones, but, . . . . . let me say this about that, these headphones seem to work perfectly, the sound is fine for me, the battery life is awesome, the range is incredible, but they suck ! They absolutely will not stay put ! If you lay back on a pillow, they shoot off the front of your head. If you drop your sack of Cheetos, there they go again ! God forbid you get up to fix a bowl of ice cream, for they WILL be in the sink ! Absolutely incredible to think that one would have to put up with this kind of design flaw in the 21st century ! If you want headphones you have to balance on your head to use, buy these !"
5,Excellent Wireless Headphone,"I have owned several wireless headphones and believe me this is the best ever. Good sound, comfortable, easy to recharge, and best of all its price. Strongly recommend."
2,Good while it lasted,"I got these headphones about a year ago. Over time they started to deteriorate. First, after three months, the cradle stopped charging. So I switched to regular batteries. I have to change the batteries almost once a week or once every two weeks. Lately, the volume is not working correctly. When I turn them on, the volume is fine, but after ten minutes I have to increase it, after an hour I have to increase it again. Basically these are not usable after a year. I'm very disappointed. I expected Sennheiser Headphones to last at least as long as my RCA headphones lasted. I guess they don't make anything like they used to."
2,HEADPHONES,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE HEADSET. I WANTED TO USE THEM WHILE EXERCISING TO JUST LISTEN TO MUSIC AND DROWN OUT THE BACKGROUND NOISE. THEY WOULD SLIP OFF MY HEAD, AND SSO I SENT THEM BACK."
1,Not good,"Terrible reception, only get sound out of the right side. I changed batteries moved it to another TV still does not work properly. If I would have saved the packaging instead of throwing it away immidiately I would have returned it!!!! My cheap RCA's that I was replacing are still better than this one..."
2,Background noise,"I am getting a lot of background noise. I would expect to have close to zero static sound when I minimize the input volume but this is not true with these headphones.More than that, low frequencies are not so powerful, high frequencies are not so sharp."
2,Tested the headset,"I followed the instructions to charge before use, etc. I then tried using all three channels to tune the sets to eliminate the hum/buss in the background. While settling for ok/poor quality sound, the headsets dropped the signal and inserted a very loud static noise level in my ears. So loud it hurt. I then returned to headsets to try another brand. It may have been more than one issue but I don't have time to test and return. The set I have now are great. Try tma's."
4,"OVERALL EXCELLENT VALUE, A FEW MINOR ISSUES","Overall, this is a great product. It is comfortable, has a great range, and very good sound. The reviews about losing signal in a few songs is true - about 1 of 100 songs the range of the song is too quiet and low and it simply goes to static. Also, the further you are from the source, the more likely you are to get a low hiss. But the value is incomparable."
2,Auto On-Off Annoying,"If not for the automatic on-off, this would have been a good purchase. Unfortunately, this feature does annoy you if every ten minutes the unit turns off and then you hear a loud static sound! Frustrating! I ended up watching the program on TV without using the unit. Angry stare from wife? or damaging my ear drum?...lesser evil - chose angry stare from wifey."
4,Reasonable Headphones,"These headphones are very comfortable for long periods. They are a bit loose for moving around excessivly, ie working out. Auto on and off as well as charging stand nice features. Nice range!"
3,"Quality sound, but","These headphones have excellent quality sound, a little heavier then I expected but that's ok.What I'm not happy with is that you are supposed to be able to move around within 24' of itsbase, and you can't. I wanted to be able to listen to music while out working in my flower gardenthat is 10' away from the base unit or cleaning around the house and can't do either because ofstatic."
4,Great quality,"They are great sounding, adjusment volume & frequency. I gave them to my husband (after my brother in law bought a pair) and he uses them often, the only downside is that his ears get hot and often doesn't like to wear them for long periods of time."
5,Excellent Product,"These wireless headphones are just the thing for me. Now I can watch TV late at knight and not disturb anyone that is sleeping! Also, when there is a lot of background noise from the family and friends, I can listen to every word of a broadcast that is important to me. These headphones are well worth the money as compared to some cheap models I've had in the past!!"
5,wireless headphones,Excellent fidelity. Good range (at least 40ft.) comes with rechargeable batteries and recharging holding cradle. Relatively comfortable for long listening. A very good buy.
4,sennheiser RS120,"Overall, a very good product and I am satisfied.First I ordered two headphones, as I was told that when plugged into the TV, the TVs sound was muted. This is true with the small headphones plug, but when plugged into the audio output plugs, [I think they're called RCA plugs], the TV sound was independent of the headphones. I could mute the TV speakers and still hear on the headphones. Perfect for what I wanted.The only negatives are:The instructions are very basic, and not too helpful. Its not too hard to figure out how to set them up tho.Also, the volume and on/off switches could have been bigger and more user friendly.Overall, I reccomend this product."
4,"Great solution, and only minor issues","I bought this to keep from waking the wife when I was watching TV in the next room. It's fairly comfortable, has good range (at least within our house) and it's a snap to set up. I was especially impressed with the magnetic grip on the charging base that makes sure it's snug against the terminals. The only downside to the headphones is the interference. There is always a little background hiss, and these are definately NOT build for high-quality audio(even though they have a pretty good bass reproduction). When I listen to events without a lot of loud noise (think Golf announcing), the hissing is clearly audible. When I listen to louder chanels it almost disappears behind the audio.All in all, I would definately recommend these for someone that needs an entry level solution for keeping the noise down around the house. I would definately buy these again, and when my headphones for my computer break, I just might!"
4,good listening,"I purchased this for my husband, who is hard of hearing. He has a hearing aid, but this wireless headphone is SO much better. He said he can understand everything they are saying on the TV. He enjoys using it very much, with no problems."
5,Excellent product,"I bought these headphones and charging base for myself a couple of years ago. The quality is outstanding! I just recently bought another set for my wife at a terrific Amazon price. We now have two great headphone units and a spare charging base. I am not an audiophile, just an old man who can't hear the tv at the volume which my wife prefers. So this product keeps our home happy. Thanks Sennheiser and Amazon!"
4,Works great .,"Sound quality is good and clear. Any static that can be heard is generated by the TV or Stereo or the connection and not the head phones. Although it may seen somewhat bulky, the headphone are reasonable in weight and its size should not be compared with wired models. The volume and tone controls are sensitive. Overall great piece of audio equipment."
4,Very pleased,"I am very pleased with my headphones. There is a *slight* hum when there is no other sound, but it doesn't interfere with my listening. I use it for the TV, because I have trouble hearing dialog. If I turn up the TV so I can hear, my wife complains it's too loud. I also like them for being able to watch TV if my wife goes to bed early or wants to listen to the stereo."
1,"I'm not a audiophile, but these really sound awful!",Terrible sound quality! Bad clipping. Will not tune properly on any preselect channel. Insufficient volume. If you have three discreet channels on the transmitter why would you put a really touchy analog tuner on the headset right next to the volume control??? I tried all three channels and had the same result. Really disappointed in these. Based on the previous reviews it appears that they either work or they don't....
4,RS120,I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 for my father who just moved into a retirement community where TV's and music cannot be played after 10:00 PM. My father is very happy not only with the performance but the freedom the unit provides to him.
2,Didn't work,"I have tried several different devise's, but all have static as this one did. I sent it back, I'm not sure if it's the devise or my TV.."
5,So far their great,Hooked them up with a really small amp through the preout on the back of our main amp so my husband can hear without blasting me out. The hook up was a little tricky but works great. The sound quality is good and my husband is really happy with them so far.
5,Even better than I'd hoped,"I had been looking for a good quality pair of wireless headphones for some time, and after reading tech reviews on cnet.com and user reviews on amazon, I decided to give these a try. I got a better price on this exact pair than I would have at the store, and I didn't have to go pick it up because even with shipping, it was still cheaper on Amazon. The unit took all of two minutes to install, and takes up very little room. It takes a few seconds to tune it, but after that, there are no problems with static or other interference. If you have the volume turned up too high, however, it will be slightly audible to other people (although to me, it's not enough to disturb). Keep in mind, this is not going to be THX sound or anything, but overall the quality is very good, and the range is also surprisingly good... that makes it easy to walk around the house during commercials and know exactly when your program comes back on. I definitely recommend these!"
4,Preliminary impression is very favorable,"I gave these as a gift, but I did get to play with them for a short time.The sound is very nice, battery life seems to be about nine hours, receiving range is >100 ft. I don't see any weak points in design (for ruggedness).A little more expensive than some of the other brands, but I don't regret paying the difference."
4,Sound great,"My only complaint about these headphones is the need to manually tune them in sometimes (that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5). But that's it. They really sound clear with almost unnoticeable hiss, even at a distance. My guess is that the more expensive models in this family of headphones do a better job a tuning in to the signal."
2,"Great, but just stopped working","I loved these headphones. The sound was fantastic. They were comfortable. Then, one day, they just stopped working. All I get is static. A lot of money to pay for something with such a short lifespan."
1,"great sound, but has interferance","The sound is supurb with this unit... but i'm not sure if its just my house, but every 10 -15 minutes, the headset would drift frequency and get static. Also, the instuctions that came with it, did not even mention there was a switch on the base to change freq ranges.. this did help some, but still did not stop the drifting. I have returned unit."
5,should have bought these sooner,I am so happy I finally broke down and bought these. Now I can watch TV without blowing everyone else out of the room! They work like a charm. great sound quality. Easy to hook up to the TV. They are a little bulky but not bad. I like that I control the volume on the headset and if anyone else is watching tv with me the tv volume can be adjusted for them.
4,Works well,"I really like it. This way I can walk around the house listening to the TV while others are not bothered. So far it serves the purpose well. I like the charging station as well, it is easy to use."
2,working poor,adjustment control works poor. hard to get proper frequency- sometimes imposable at 10 feet. revew is set up hard to use. will not be revewing any more
5,Great,My husband wears hearing aids & needs a boost for tv. He thinks these are great. Had another brand & they didn't last long.
4,Great Heaphones...With a Few Downsides,"These headphones are great, and they're backed by an excellent company that knows pro-audio. However, I've experienced a good amount of static (depending on which way I pivot my head) and the fit is less than desirable. They're a bit bulky and will fall off if I look down. But overall, I like them. They've got great sound quality and they allow me to roam around while listening to music or podcasts."
2,Not Impressed....,"I have a small house and the layout makes it hard to watch tv late at night without disturbing my toddler and husband. After suffering many sleepless nights where I would have to strain to hear the tv, sometimes not being able to hear it at all when the heater was on, I bought headphones. I decieded on these because of the design and price. The work ok but will spontaenously turn off creating a VERY loud static sound. This is not very nice to hear when you are falling asleep. Sometimes it would take three or four times resetting them before I'd get an hour or two of uninterrupted time. Not worth the price due to the performance."
1,Sennheiser Rs120 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones With Charging Cradle,"I bought this headphone without checking the actual size of the headphones. So, when I recieved it from Amazon, it was too big and heavy for me. I also couldn't get a clear sound from the reception."
5,Very satisfied,"I got these for my wife for Christmas, and she is very happy with them. They are more comfortable than the older brand she used to wear, and reception is good on the second floor even with the transmitter along an outside wall in the basement. The recharging stand is innovative and extremely convenient."
1,Not sure why it didnt work???,"I was very excited to recieve the headphones in the mail. I opened it and it worked great for about two days. Then I just got interference and it wouldnt come in clearly. I tried moving it around the house, trying different stations. Nothing worked. I ended up returning the headphones and was very impressed with the efficiency of the Amazon return sytem."
5,Sennheiser Wireless Headphone,"The Sennheiser Wireless headphone works great. The sound is clear, finding a good channel is easy, and the distance is acceptable but could be better."
2,Don't believe the 5 star reviews,"This was my first wireless headphone. And it last for 35 min, before packaging it back and requesting a refund from amazon.So, it does have a nice charging feature, but it stops there. The manual tuning is horrible. Remember the old radios from the 80's? That's how you are suppose to tune this thing. It's very sensitive, leaving no room for mistakes. I was playing xbox 360, and took me around 5 minutes to finally get a good enough sound. Forget about amazing stereo sound, it really sounds like an analogic radio at best. And then, I decided to change seats from the couch to the chair, a loud interference noise almost gave me a heart attack.Don't waste your money on this, save a little bit more and get a descent headphone. I regret buying this, hopefully amazon has an amazing customer support and post sales, and I'm sure I'll be able to get my money back."
4,Wireless RF Headphones,"These headphones are comfortable and have good sound quality. The base unit is a good design, charges the phones without fuss about how they are positioned, unlike some I have owned that were very difficult to achieve a good contact with the electrical surfaces. Good value. Recommended."
2,Didn't work.,"There are too many positive reviews to say they never work. However, the one I recieved would never transmit and was returned."
2,"Nice looks, crappy overall","I don't understand all the 5-star reviews here. These headphones have a lot of problems.First off, there is a problem with connectivity to the audio jack. every 20-40 minutes (Haven't noticed a pattern yet) I lose signal and have to pull out audio cable out of the PC audio jack and put it back in to restore the signal. I know it's not a problem with my audio port because I have wired earbuds and have no such issues.Then, you have the headphones that are so heavy that if I tilt my head down they slip off my head and fall.Then, the signal quality is certainly just sub-prime. For some reason I can never get the two headphones to work at the same time so I get to hear the sound in my right ear only.Overall, these headphones are a disappointment. Do not buy!"
5,I would only change 1 thing.,"I use these for my wife and I to view 2 seprate TVs, so I change the tuning chanel frequently (she is always finding the better show). My old set up had a 3 way tuning switch and a dial for sound. I find that the dial for channel tuning difficult and too close to the volume dial. I have got it down now with practice. For my father- in-law I taped over the tuning dial so he wouldn't be messing up the chanel tuning when he just wants volume.Every thing else is great, comfort, sound, the charging system, lenth of charge time, and range."
2,Do yourself a favor and get wired headphones.,"The FM hiss in these headphones is the biggest deal breaker for me in these cans. I couldn't adapt to it. Tried every trick suggested in the comments and while you can get it pretty low, if you raise the volume over normal speaking level, they hiss. The audio quality in these headphones is also pretty substandard. Bass is nonexistent, listening to classic rock and prog rock mostly, and the trebles are muddy. I have a pair of old Sony over ears that cost me $50 years ago and they make these feel like iPod ear buds. These headphones are also not meant for watching television while someone else in the room tries to sleep. The opened backs of the phones bleed substantially. These are the first wireless headphones I have ever purchased and may be the last. The only major pro to these headphones is that they have a substantial range. Can roam around my yard and not experience any loss on my postage stamp suburban lawn."
5,Cristina,"My house has a loft at the top of it. It is my dughter's bedroom, unfortunatelly, the volume of the TV travels very clearly up to it. It has been a blessing to have the headphones because she does not longer complains about the ""loud volume"" Also, when I watch movies from netflix, somewhat, the volume is very low and I have to raise it in order for me to listen clearly. Now with my hearphones, I can watch movies at night. They are comfortable, light weithg and can be out of sight very easily. My daughter likes them too because she does not have to complaint any longer."
4,Good performance. Good deal,Bought these so that I could work out on my bike trainer and watch TV/movies/etc. without blasting out the rest of the house. Sound quality is excellent. Comfort is great and they stay on my head during even when sweating. A great combination of performance and price.
1,Can't get it to work!,The directions for this product leave MUCH to be desired! I have had it for about a month and can not figure out how to get it to actually work. Wish I had never bought it.
3,OOOPS!,I was hoping to score some wireless headphones that would allow me to listen to the TV radio w/o waking my wife (as I did with the cumbersome wired version). Was I in error? I have them transmitting from the audio output jack on the front of my old A/V Pioneer stereo receiver. No settings I've found so far have allowed me to do this. Guide me please!!I have the tv speakers turned off and a home theater (circa the 80's) set up.
1,Not worth shopping here.,"This is the third time I have ordered from Amazon and the third time I received inferior merchandise.My cousin ordered a coffee pot, many yrs ago and it has the same defect that mine has. I asked her where she bought it and ... yep ... it came from Amazon.com Three times and you're out. Goodbye!"
3,Fair erratic performer,"I have a simmilar Sennheiser model and have found them to perform eratically. Sometimes they don't find signal and it can be most annoying. We had an old cheaper set from another manufacturer that worked great just didn't take an unexpected drop very well(oops). So we bought the Sennheiser based on reviews at the time. Sound quality is good, when it works though.To Magic!! I have a Sony XS955 TV set and it's the Sony's fault why the headphones don't work. It states in the Sony manual that you need to TURN OFF the internal speakers for the line out output to work. What was Sony thinking?? They even sell wireless headphones, and never tested their sets with them. Grrrr. NOT ADA Approved!"
1,Major Poteltial Health Risk Hidden!!!!!!!,"ATTENTION: MAJOR RISK FOR PACEMAKER WEARERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buried deeply in a small leaflet that most purchasers would probably ignore is a warning that unusually strong magnetic fields generated by these headphones could cause serious problems for pacemaker wearers. No doubt, some folks will play down this risk, but any risk of death should be taken seriously, in my opinion. This information should be prominently displayed on the package and here at the Amazon site, but it is not.Caveat Emptor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TAP"
5,Excelent headpones,"I bought the headphones, after i did my research of witch product will be better for my dollars, i saw Sony, Bose, and some others and the one that I needed and fit my budget ware the Sennheiser RS120 and the price was great, I even went to the electronics stores here locally and not even they got this price, so it was the perfect fit for my and my money, the sound quality its excellent and i even went out of the house to see if I still got signal and my surprise was that even that far (about 60 ft) i was amazed. great product."
2,Fit,I do not believe my head is smaller than your average person.Yet. the bloody headphones keep falling off my head. There does not appear that there is any way to make an adjustment. I am really miffed.
2,"Good price, but not perfect sound","These are an excellent price, and the sound is ""ok"", but there is a hissing sound in the background that is difficult to minimize (even changing channels, moving the base like it says)."
4,Lacking Bass,"Helpful hit:Turn off any other wireless devices in your house while useing the headphones.I had my baby monitor on and I got scratchy reception.However, when I turned it off, it was clear as a bell!! :DThe product has 'some' bass, but I usually listen to ambient - house music, and the headphones aren't cut out for it.Classical, country, rock, and TV would be great for these headphones.Overall, it's a great product!"
2,annoying hissing,I have not been able to find a way to eliminate an annoying interference for the headphones (I have two) The transmitter is plugged into the headphone outlet of an Onkyo receiver. When playing radio or cds -no problem. When viewing dvds or watching tv it is really a pain.
4,Wireless earphones,"The earphones are excellent in all qualities except that the controls tend to be a bit hard to access on the earphones and are not smooth - particularly volume and tuning. The biggest problem is that they are open phones and I wear them in bed at night. I did not realize how much sound escapes to disturb my wife who is sleeping by my side. These are not earphones to get if you wish to preserve quiet around you. Get closed phones. Otherwise, excellent"
3,Sssshhhh !,Could have been cheaper. Not very comfortable on the ears as it does not surround the ears but sits on it. Painful by the end of the football game. Hissing sound and clicks very loud at times. Not a huge improvement over the cheaper one I bought at circuit-city few years ago.
2,"Lots of static, very little sound","Terrible. When I connect the cradle to my TV, I get lots of static on every channel. The static is much louder than the actual sound of the program. I am returning it."
4,As advertised,"These are great. Great sound, and picks up better sounds than my surround sound system. The only reason I would not give this 5 stars is that it falls off my head sometimes. There are just a bit wide and I have a conical aka egg shaped head. and the other reason is that you can't just turn off the base when not in use. Once it picks up an audio signal it will turn on, even if you are not using the headphones.For the price, it really can't be beat."
1,Dead after 2 years,"I have had these headphones for about 2 years now. It was working OK. Yes, there was some hiss, but it was tolerable. Then, out of the blue, the transmitter just died. No, it was not a receiver battery issue. NO matter what sound source I connect it to (and I have tried a few different ones to be sure), the green light on the transmitter won't turn on, and the unit just won't transmit.I expect something like this to last for WAY more than 2 years. Shame on Sennheiser for a poor quality product."
4,Nice product for the price,The headphones work very well I can walk downstairs to the kitchen and hear when the commercials are over. They are pretty comfortable my only complaint is when I lean forward they slip off my ears. For the price I paid I would recommend them to a friend.
2,Nice sounding headphones when you can hear them,"Sennheiser products have always been synonomous with quality but I take exception to the cheap construction of these headphones. When you move your head the slightest little bit, the part that goes on top of your head creaks loudly. They even creak when I clench my jaw during suspensful scenes. The actual sound quality is good but the constant loud creaking is a pain in the neck. The batteries hold a charge well and the charger works well.They still work perfectly well after several years but they have been retired to my junk closet due to the intolerable creaking noises."
1,crappy quality,"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORSE SET I HAVE EVER PURCHASED THE QUALITY IS CRAP,ONE I GET UP FROM THE COUCH I LOSE SOUND WHILE YOU ARE SITTING THEY ARE NOT TO BAD,I ORG HAS THE SAME MODEL BUT THE TR 140 HAD THEM 6 YEARS AND EVENTUALLY THE PLASTIC ON ONE SIDE BROKE THE HEADPHONES STILL WORK THE QUALITY WAS GREAT I COULD GO OUT SIDE AND STILL HEAR MY MOVIE THE NEWER ONE ARE JUST PLAIN CRAPPY HAVE SENT THEM BACK ONCE ALREADY AND STILL NO JOY"
1,Still not received after 6 weeks,"Ordered on 1/31 and after a two weeks I was informed that their ""outside"" vendor ran out of them and could not fulfill the order. After a small hassle we were able to get our money back and then reordered them in the middle of Feb from Amazon itself. Amazon said it will ship them when they get them in stock, possible as far out as April. Can't say anything about them if I don't have them - thus the 1 star for the problems we have had in even getting them."
3,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones,The reception was good but not totally crisp.The price point was good compared to other web sites. The headphone earpieces were not as comfortable as an earlier model and slipped off easier.
1,Just stopped working.................,Was very excited to get these headphones. They were great for a little while. Used them maybe 10 times. Then they just stopped working. Would not recommend them.
2,Extremely poor headphone design,"Technically, functionality and sound are very good. The negative is you could not have designed a worse set of headphones. They are uncomfortable and fall off your head with any movement. I can't believe they went to market with such a poor design. Fix the headphones and you've got a great product!"
1,A Disappointment For Me!,"Tried on multiple TVs I couldn't get this to work. I got static most of the time except for once when I got a neighbors phone conversation loud and clear!It didn't matter where I placed it. I also tried new rechargeable batteries and charged them before testing, but it just doesn't work. I'm VERY disappointed, considering all the 5 star ratings. I'm going to try the Sony infrared, since I don't care if it ""works through walls""Sent it back! Thank heavens Amazon makes that easy!"
4,"Sennheiser + Wireless = awesome, but it's a shame about that static","I love these Sennheiser heaphones. They sound great, wireless improved my outlook on life, and the price is sweet. The heaphones recover their charge while resting on the wireless base station. On the negative side, static sometimes intrudes when I'm wandering around my apartment (and trust me, it's a tiny apt!). The other REALLY ANNOYING issue is that a few minutes after the music stops LOUD STATIC erupts from the headphones, prompting immediate removal. This is extremely annoying and preventable. Also, the foam ear pieces do not block out outside noise very well."
1,Unbearable Static,Static is unbearable.Goes from bad tss tss tss tss to worst CHSHHSHSHSHSHSHSHSSHHSHS.Yay! This will be my first return with amazon.
2,Not at all mind blowing,Purchased because of posotive reviews. Hooked it up and have been constantly dissapointed. CONSTANT INTERFERENCE. I quute literally cannot get it to operate with hissing or popping or whining. Tried everything from changing the frequency its operating on to moving the transmitter. Dissapointed
1,Useless,"This is a shame. I bought these because of so many good reviews. They are light weight, the audio quality is good, but none of that matters because I can't get a clean signal anywhere.I tried 3 different outlets, 2 which were directly into the wall. At best I get one channel of music and the other ""channel"" of hiss. When I get actual sound (music) in both sides (by adjusting the tune control), it's only one channel, not stereo. They are also not even, either (one side isn't as loud as the other.) In addition, they buzz through my amp which is where I really wanted them. I also tried again the next day in yet another outlet and audio system and the same thing happened.Maybe I just got a bad pair, but these are completely useless to me and am sending them back."
1,Disappointing,"I wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews. These do not work, after a few minutes the base disconnects and the static blasts. These are a waste of money. I wish I had tried them out immediately and returned them."
4,A very good wireless headphone.,"If you are looking for some very decent wireless headphones at very decent price, look no further.Pros: Very light and comfortable.Very good battery life.Good sound quality.Cons: Sound could be better. Could use more bass."
2,keep looking,These were highly rated and very popular which swayed my decision to these over other sets. Do not follow the crowd reception is poor with low output and small poorly laid out controls. Nice idea but not well executed.
2,Hated these immediately,"I hated these as soon as I put them on. They don't fit well and don't stay in place. Try making dinner with these on -- you know, bending down to get pots and pans out of the lower cupboards and such... These things fly right off. And the ear fatigue is TERRIBLE!! My ears STILL hurt. Look at the profile of the ear pieces. They're completely flat -- big flat panels pressed against your ears. Really horribly uncomfortable. No idea how these things got more than 3 stars... I guess people just use them sitting down for short periods of time. They still don't feel good, even for short term listening. (Otherwise they're fine... the radio works well and they charge and everything.) But, I'm returning mine. WAY too uncomfortable."
3,headphones,"The headphones are way too loose and unless you keep head erect they slide or fall off. There should be something that could tighten the earcuffs so they do not fall off. By the way, I do not have a small head. For a woman I am on the large side.du"
3,Decent but Overpriced,"I live in a tiny apartment so range isn't really an issue. These headphones work acceptably well, but I do get a strange digital interference sound sometimes, especially when there's silence on the TV. It's not the worst problem in the world, but for a pair of headphones at this price I would have preferred a bit better sound quality and fidelity.Also, I'm not sure I understand why headphones need to be so bulky. We can fit entire computers into phones, I feel like we should be able to make a sleeker, more comfortable pair of headphones.Overall, you can do much worse, but for the price you might be able to do a little better."
4,Great,A little expensive but worth it. They are very comfortable and the sound is very clear. They have a tuning option that helps to keep the sound clear
2,Sennheiser RS120,The workmanship is shoddy. There is a loose wire so sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn not. Inadequate accompanying material to describe product and its use. Sound quality average when it works.
3,For people with big heads,"Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging CradleThe sound is excellent for the price. However, these headphones do not have an adjustment for width and keep falling off while trying to recline and watch tv. There is no adjustment that allows the user to make them fit more snuggly. Additionally, the way the Amazon product info is provided for this item, it shows two associated cables that are ordered with it making the customer believe that they may also be needed for it to work properly!! This is not the case. Everything needed comes with the headphones themselves. I will be looking for something to replace them as soon as I can afford it. I hate having to constantly adjust this set because it keeps slipping off. Highly recommended if you have a very wide head!!"
4,Great quality in all aspects,"I wanted to buy this headphones for my husband is a huge Sony fan, but after reading some bad reviews about the Sony headphones, I took a risk and tried this brand for the first time. I don't regret it! He loves it and me too. They are very comfortable, great sound reception, excellent sound quality, very easy of recharging. Will definitely buy again!"
4,good product **cheap**,Bought for dad who turns tv up to high all the time. Provides others in the household some relief. Dad loves the wireless. We love the peace and quiet!
3,substandard headphone design,"Sennheiser is an excellent company. We retired a previous Sennheiser wireless headphone kit after 10 years of service and replaced them with the RS120. The sound quality and range is appreciably improved but I'm sorry I didn't look closely at the RS120 before buying. The headphone design is poor.Our previous headphones had swiveling earpieces and earcups. They stayed in place as you moved about. The RS120 is a more basic design -- no swivel, flat stiff earpieces. The headphones only stay in place if you remain still and vertical.I recommend Sennheiser wireless phones but look at the RS140 and up."
4,Worth buying,"Bought 2 pairs of these. One so I could use while listening to Christmas music, and one for my father--so he doesn't chase my mother out of the house with the loud TV! I do get some crackling, intermittently, while moving around doing chores, otherwise the sound is excellent. Has been easy to use. Headphones even comfortable for my Dad, who wears about a size 7 1/2."
2,Had to return it,"Had static...had to ""play "" with the placing of the earphones in the charging cradle to get a spot where it would charge.."
4,Great when there is no interference,"Good product, but strong hissing sound by ANY electrical appliance; light, massage chair, stereo receiver, cordless phone etc. You have to fine tune almost every time you change your sitting position, or you can change your sitting position again to avoid interference. I give an above okay on headset comfort factor."
3,Good Unit but Like RS140 better,"RS 120 is a decent unit with a good transmitter/charger base.{same base as more expensive Sennheiser units) The head phones work well enough but they are designed to not fit as well as the more costly units. The seller, Electronics Expo, is an absolute no no. Their phone system is impossible to work with because they are so far off shore. Via email I have been dealing with them for a month to get a defective unit replaced. No More 3rd party sellers for Me."
3,Does what's advertised - nothing to write home about,"If you are looking for a pair of wireless headphones in this price range, these will do.Good:- easy enough to get setup- super easy to chargeBad:- background noise a little excessive at times- sometimes you have to 'recalibrate' the headphone/base unit connections after turning it on and off againHad them a couple days. Let's see how long they last."
4,"Questions,Please help! Thx","Over all great performance.A couple of simple questiones though.1, I recently relocate to China and brought it with me and how do I get it work also in China? (do I need to buy a power adapter?)2, If the cradle charger is non functional, where do I go for repair?"
4,Definitely a good value,"These headphones came out of the box with all accessories necessary for your setup. I have a computer, tv, gaming system in the same area that i wanted to be able to plug in whenever i needed. it has the headphone jack AND the red/white RCA cable connectors.I rated it 4 of 5, because the sound quality isn't amazing. the Bass is lacking, and this is someone expected from crappy rechargeable batteries but i was hoping to be surprised."
4,Decent value,"Excellent headphone for clarity and range, and reasonably comfortable. Only down side is that being on-ear, they tend to slip when used while engaging in active tasks."
3,"Good, but some annoying flaws","I bought the headphones despite of the numerous reviews that talked about the static sound and some noises...well, their explanation not even came close to how annoying it can be. Don't get me wrong, the sound is fantastic once it is up and running, and the fact that you have the ability to change the volume right in the headphones comes quite handy when you are walking around the house while listening to the news (!).But I can't get over the fact that sometimes you have to unplug and plug again because the sound will not come in, or the static noise you get before you turn in your TV...It should be completely silent, right???But if you can live with this minor annoyance the sound is great!"
5,excellent sound quality,after seeing the advertisements on tv decided to check the reviews on this product and glad i purchased this instead of wasting money-the sound quality is excellent-easy to replace on charger
3,Sennheiser RS120,"This product does what it's supposed to do. For the price, it gets the job done; I do not have to deal with long cables to listen to my movies without bothering those around me, or my neighbors. Is there a better product out there for the price? Probably. Am I satisfied with this one? Yes, it is okay."
1,Another Christmas ruined,"I was unable to get these headphone to give me a clear signal of any kind. You had to hold you head perfectly still to get bad mono reception, as soon as you moved your head you would get blasted with squelch. I tried every channel combination, tuned it every way I could. This set is basically worthless, and I have to return another gift that doesnt work. I can only assume I have a bad transmitter but they need to QA this stuff."
5,GREAT headphones,"I love these headphones..easy to install, WORK great first time I used them was able to walk all over my place no interruption no hiss..great bargain I have no complaints...!"
1,Suddenly LOUD static noise for no reason....,"Even used with in 20ft from the base and tune to the right freq...then after a while, lost the audio signal and filled with a loud static noise. I was disappointed for the price I paid. On a positive note, if you are using it for your TV class, this might work well. By the time you wondering off, it will brings you with a loud...sahhhh...in your ear."
5,Very pleased with these headphones,"I have been using these headphones for a few months now and am very happy with them. They offer clear sound, are comfortable, and were easy to set up. I definitely recommend them."
2,Interference destroys the product,"This product suffers from some horrible interference, randomly blasting static at about double the volume of the source. Additionally, rather than having an intelligent power save functionality, the headphones will output the same static noise continuously if the base station goes into sleep mode while the headphones are on. Since this can happen after just a couple of minutes, one needs to be very careful when pausing the source that they are watching.Aside from the deafening static issues, the product has seemingly awesome battery life and sound quality (considering the price and the wireless connection), but the static blasts are a deal breaker."
2,"has a problem with a ""short:"" in the system","The problem with this headset is that it has a ""short"" in the electrionics , as the sound comes on and off.Very irritating."
5,Great Headphones,"Finally! I don't have to listen to my wife's reality shows while trying to read and go to sleep!!!! Headphones work great. Recommend them to anybody who has a spouse/partner who watches pointless TV shows on a TV in the bedroom. The headphones remove a thorn in a very good relationship. Clear reception, comfortable, no problems."
3,Needs Improovement,Has a hissing sound in the backround. Not terrible but far from great. Like a radio in a parking lot.
3,Sennheiser Rs 120 wireless headphones,This item replaces another same brand and model purchased about 45 days prior. The first item started cutting out sound after in use about 30 days and you had to put it back on the charging cradle for a few minutes. This would happen with little or no time using it. The replacement item worked until it had been in use about 10 or 15 days and it has started cutting out occasionally. The headphone is being used about 20 feet from the TV and it's charging cradle. It usually cuts out after in use for about an hour or so. Never used over 2 or 3 hours at time.
4,better sound than tv,i can finally enjoy watching tv the headphones are great only thing missing is an indicating lite on them i have a pair of sony with the lite but these are definitely better sound
3,Good headphones for the price,Just recieved and tested my headphones and was presently surprised. They do fit loose so inless you don't plan on moving around while using them they will be fine. The sound quality is excellent and the surround sound effects are great for movies. Despite using headphones other around you will be able to hear the movie/music while using these at any reasonable volume. The sound is clear of hissing for the most part but you still get the occasional breakthough of static. As with all wireless headphones this can not be avoided. It is somewhat annoying but for this price range these are the best headphones you can get.
2,Almost Unlistenable,"Maybe I was hoping for too much. The bass is overboosted and static pops between quiet passages. Though wireless headphones are a great idea, look elsewhere."
2,Headsize,"I received this product today, and they sound really good. The problem I have is they are poorly designed and will not stay on my head. The earpads are flat and cheap. I will be returning them, as everytime I move my head they slip off. This is terribly annoying."
3,A little whiney,"I usually don't get more than about 10 feet from the base station, but sometimes I get some high-pitched whining noise, very annoying. There's nothing I can do to make it stop, except take off the headphones. Which pretty much defeats the purpose of having headphones, don't you think? Otherwise, when that whine isn't present, I enjoy using them."
5,Great product,"My husband has used the Sennheiser RS-120 headphones at night so he doesn't disturb my sleep and is extremely happy with the performance. They are comfortable to wear and the sound is crisp and clear. Also, the silence is golden for me."
2,Static and interference,"I live in a condo building in Chicago and these headphones were unusable due to static and interference. Tried all three bands to no avail. Even standing 2' away from the transmitter, there was a quiet but audible hiss at all times plus bursts of static like you'd hear on the radio anytime I moved my head.They did sound good, but the interference was just too much to bear."
2,Transmitter times out too soon,"Great audio walking around the house. The signal is overall very good. Very comfortable.Bad: These headphones are designed so that after 2 minutes of no sound being transmitted, (for example, you paused your iTune track) the transmitter turns itself off and all you get a sudden earful of LOUD static through the headphones. Don't count on wearing these if you want to turn your computer speakers off and just wear headphones at your desk for the occasional song or sound. If there aren't any sounds playing, you'll be blasted abruptly with loud static after the 2 minute timeout period. I wish there was a way to set how long that is -- 2 minutes seems way too short and it always happens abruptly."
1,Horrible uncomfortable headphones,"The ear pad are hard and the press on the ear making these very uncomfortable to wear, I sent them back."
3,Great for the Price,"Occasionally I will hear brief static when moving but otherwise they sound very clear. No noticeable hissing sounds. Only real complaint is they don't reproduce and low bass at all, just highs and mid range."
4,Great sound,They work great no signal interference what so ever. They are a little loose on my head. They are so lite that you even forget they are on sometimes. I've no issues with the range.
5,Excellent Choice!,"This is a great product! The quality of sound is just outstanding, plus the range is also excellent--even thru walls!"
3,Pleased but confused,"Product works. Instructions were TERRIBLE. Instructions were on 4 separate pieces of paper, had to piece everything together. A lot of guessing for the set up. Didn't say to charge the headset needed to be on the stand. The charge light does not always come on when you put the headphones on the stand. We didn't realize that you have to quick turn your TV on mute to use them. Over all the product works with a little futzing around, but it wasn't all that intuitive."
2,Not very long-lasting product,This headphone set worked very well with limited use. I've had it for a litle over two months and the problems are now starting. The headphone cut off after approximately 10 minutes and it takes quite awhile to get the tuner to work again as well as getting rid of the noise associated with it. I thought it might have been my location and I used the less expensive RS110 which worked perfectly.I do not recommend the RS120 unless you have to have re-chargeable batteries. The RS110 is a better headset at a much lower price. The only difference is that the RS110 uses regular batteries so don't waste your money on the less reliable RS120.
4,Good sound,"This is the second set of wireless headphones I've owned. First was JVC. Sound is good -- I use it exclusively with TV so as not to disturb sleeping family members, so not sure if it would be audiophile quality with a high quality source. Seems well constructed, very comfortable to wear for extended periods. Charging cradle is great. Just set it on rack and little worry about whether the contacts are lined up or properly positioned."
1,two times defective!,"Purchased as a gift for my husband. Arrived on time and packaging was good. However, the connection from the headphones to the charging cradle was not complete. It almost seemed like the wire included was for another model. Ordered a replacement. Received promptly by Amazon. HOWEVER, same situation only worse! Waste of my time. And I HATE returning items as the process if never correct.Amazon services good. Seinheiser sucks!"
4,Sennheiser RS120,"I have two wireless headphones, one for each TV. I have a hearing problem and these headphones are the best answer. I can actually hear better with the headphones not wearing my hearing aids than listening to the TV with just my hearing aids using the surround speakers with no headphones on. I have only one negative to say about the Sennheiser RS120, it has a tendency to slide on my head a bit. If I make sure they are positioned well there is no problem. The other headphones I own are Sony RF970. The negative for them is that the phones not only automatically shut off when not using, but they often shut off when you readjust their position on your head or just move your head. This is especially a problem if you are lying down. They also do not have the clarity of the Sennheiser RS120. The Sony phones still sound very good, but not as good as the Sennheiser. Overall I found the problem of the Sennheiser slipping much easier to deal with than shutting off problem with the Sony."
5,Gift for Mom,Great gift for anyone. Mom is 78 and a little hard of hearing. She said watching TV is a whole new experience. If she was watching the news and just needed to listen while she went to the kitchen or another part of the house she said this is GREAT!! I was pleased that the headphones came with every thing that I needed to get Mom hooked up. I think I'll put in a request for my birthday. The shipping was also very fast. Great product for the price.
5,Great product!,I don't have to have the TV blaring when I'm on the treadmill! Reception is perfect- NO static at all.Amazon's price was at least $30 cheaper than either Target or Best Buy!I definitely recommend this.
3,great... when they work,"These Sennheiser headphones are comfortable and well made. They sound really good when they are working. The issue I have is they jump to static for no reason whatsoever. You will be listening and then just static. No one touches the tuning control, you don't move or anything. It really gets irritating."
4,"Good, not Great","If you are simply going to lay in bed and watch tv, without disturbing others, the head phones are nice. They do not have heavy base, but there is a nice full sound. If you want to walk around, sometimes they cut out, and my par, while tuning them, picked up my neighbors phone call. Over all, I have been very happy and for the price, they are great."
2,My House Evidently Doesn't Like These Headphones,"I bought two sets of these headphones, one for use in my bedroom and one for the living room. The first night I set them up they worked perfectly for 2 hours. The next day I was not able to receive a signal at all in the living room, although the bedroom pair was working fine. I swapped them around and discovered each pair worked fine in the bedroom, but not in the living room. I bought a long cable extension to move the transmitter out of the living room, but that didn't help.I must be getting some kind of interference from somewhere. The bedroom pair started picking up static as well after a week, so I gave up on them. I would rather have a wire connection and know I will have good sound than wonder if my headphones are going to be working or not. But you may not have the interence problems I have. When they work they are good headphones."
5,Sennheiser Wireless Headphones: Sounds Reasonable To Me,"Ordering: a breeze.Price:reasonable.Product: exceptional(Both).Wife: happy.Dog: mixed, no cord to trip over, but none to chew either."
3,"Poor volume control, fantastic sound.","The sound is fantastic, but be careful with the volume control. On mine it was very poorly constructed, try to increase the volume and you might turn deaf, lower it and there is no sound. If you try to change the volume very slowly, it works, but only sometimes. I am exchanging it for another, hoping that it will work the way it should.I would recommend this due to the fantastic sound only if the volume control is fixed."
2,"Wireless static, with rechargeable batteries!!!","Some of us have HD radio, some have digital tuning, and some use those old-school dials to try to tune in properly. These headphones are like tuning in to the wrong channel...Want a quick preview of how this works? Do you have a local station at 104.3? Then tune in to 104.1 or 104.5 - that is as good as these headphones will be.We tried all sorts of tuning and adjustments on these headphones, and at it's *BEST*, it still had loud static. I have looked at other reviews and comments, where some people say the issue is wireless phones and wireless internet. Which basically means these would be good WHERE?Returned, good riddance."
1,Head Phone Dead After 6 month of infrequent use,I Purchased Sennheiser wireless headphones because I thought they were of good quality. Sound quality was not so great but ok. There was small hiss at low volume but It was ok until I faced big jolt when one of the speaker stopped working only after 6 months. I used this headphone very less frequent and very properly.It is a real shock for me because I was getting a cheap RF headphone for $15 but I purchased this for quality. Now I am out of US and I cannot even claim warrenty.Total waste of Money. Really want to give negative Ratings. Not expected from Sennheiser.
2,Don't try these with your TV,"I bought these specifically so my wife could listen to the TV without disturbing me. The constant underlying hum is so bad that they are unusable. Before sending them back, I decided to give them a couple of days trial using them instead with my computer, listening to music as I worked, just to see if they were worth keeping even though my original intention was lost. The sound quality when used with the computer was very good. However, the power cord to the charging dock failed within two days and the headset stopped transmitting. Why are the majority of modern products so much better looking yet work so poorly these days? The packaging has gotten better and better but the concept of quality seems to have gone right out the window."
2,not recommending ...,"Makes constant hissing sound in the ear, and often it is quite painful. Have tried all kinds of frequency tuning but never got rid of the noise. Going to return the item."
2,Static and interference,Bought these to watch TV in the evenings without disturbing the kids. They have a fairly constant background hiss that I could probably learn to live with. It's the intermittent higher pitched interference/static/feedback that really got to me in the end. Tried all the suggestions like switching the transmitter channel/tuning or increasing the source sound on the TV but it made no difference. I'd be watching a scene and the interference would just randomly kick in and it was deafening at times -- literally would have to pull them off my head as quick as possible and then try again when my ears had recovered. Returned them after a week. Bought some conventional wired over the ear JVC headphones and an extension cable. For my purposes they are much better and actually about $50 cheaper.
2,"Bad hiss with this headset, will return","I am disappointed with Sennheiser regarding the RS120. Constant hiss and loss of signal when moving. I had a Radio Shack 90 MHz earphones, much cheaper that have better sound quality and very reliable. Unfortunately, they no longer sell this, as I have worn out the charging system and the unit needs help. I will return the Sennheiser RS120 and hope to find one more reliable and hiss free."
2,quit working after 3 months,"yes, they just quit working after 3 months. You put them on, they work for about 10 minutes and then they go off. They are fully charged. This is the 3rd different brand we've tried, can't seem to find one that lasts...."
2,static problems,Initially thought headphones were working well.however by 2nd use unable to hear anything through headphones except static.will be contacting company to give them a chance to offer solution to this problem.will have to wait and see...
4,Sennheiser TV Headphones,"I am happy with my purchase of the Sennheiser (RS120 926 MHz) wireless headphones. My previous wireless TV hearing device was a set of ""TV Ears."" In comparison, I probably should give the Sennheiser product all 5 stars. The battery life of the RS120 puts the TV Ears to shame, that is the most significant difference in the products.My need for the device is due to hereditary nerve deafness which has progressed noticeably in recent years (I am 63 years old). Please remember that you must use all similar headphone & earbud products with caution. It is very easy to increase volume beyond the safe range, especially for people with conditions similar to mine.PS: Service from Amazon was excellent, as have been all our former Amazon purchases."
4,headphones,Bought these for my 85 year old dad. Wears hearing aids but still cannot hear the tv. He absolutely loves theses headphones and my mom loves the peace and quiet. Could use better instructions in the package. Almost missed the power hook up because it was tucked behind the packing materials.
2,Comfortable but that is it,"I had been looking for a long time for an affordable wireless RF headset and know Sennheiser to be a good company. The 2 main issues I have with the headset is that you can only wear it for 2 hours max before the batteries go low and it turns itself off and you get this really nasty loud scratchy sound in your ears which is quite startling and horrid. The other issue is that that loud scratchy sound comes and goes no matter how you have it tuned, so you can be comfortably watching a show and all of a sudden there is a short scratchy loud noise that is totally disruptive. It comes and goes and re-tuning does not help. I live in the mountains so I do not have the radio interuptions that would occur in the city so I am not sure why the head set does this continually. I would not reccomend this set at all - I have a cheap Sony set that is much better and I wear with my other TV but it is not RF which is why I bought this headset."
2,Hopefully I just got a bad one,Mine worked reasonably ok for about a week. I never could get rid of the background noise no matter how I positioned it. I was willing to live with that but then the unit kept loosing the signal. This failure was unbearable due to a screaching static noise. Unpluging then repluging the unit in would get the sound back. Perhaps I just got a bad one.
3,"Great product, poor fit.","These headphones sound great and work well when sitting still. They are susceptible to cut outs when walking around, even well within the advertized perimeter. The charging system seems to work very well, and they run a long time on a full charge. The main complaint I have with this design is the fit. There is no way to adjust the tension and although it doesn't become uncomfortable with extended use, it is not tight enough to stay in place if you bend over to pick something up. I bought these primarily for yard work, and I have to tie them to a baseball hat to keep them on my head."
4,Senny,"clear, crisp sound. No wires and I can walk around my entire apartment listening to TV or music, good range. Easy to use, just feels like very good quality item. Blocks out annoying neighbor and outside noises."
3,Unhappy with headphones,"I was unhappy with these headphones because several times while watching TV the transmitter went off without reason, causing loud static in headphones. Returned product very easily, received a credit to my account quickly, and will continue to buy from Amazon. Usually I have no problems with products."
2,uncomfortable,"I appreciate the sound quality, but the comfort factor is quite poor. I have used radio shach wireless for about 7 years, and they were worn out. I bought the sennheiser as a replacement because RS had changed to a less quality version. The phones are uncomfortable and DO INDEED fall off if I bend over for any reason. They are also at a poor angle for my head/ears. I know the jokes that could follow, but the reader is not me. They are UNCOMFORTABLE. I wish they werent because there is nothing that I can do about it.R. Tuley"
4,Fantastic performance for the price.,"For less than $100, you can have wireless headphones that are RF rather than line-of-site IR, which means you can get up from the sofa, walk to the kitchen for a cool one, or even go relieve yourself from too many cool ones...while not missing any of the program audio. As with any over-the-ears full size headphones, they can make your ears sore if wearing them too long, but that's what commercials are for...when I take them off. I even use them when the entire family is watching something if I really want to listen and they're chatting about other things. My kids use them to play Rock Band without shaking the walls. My father-in-law used them during a visit, as he likes to stay up late watching movies. He absolutely loved them, so we ordered another set for his Christmas present."
2,save your receipt!,"Product has a two year warranty. Save your receipt! My receiver went out before the warranty would have expired. If I had only saved the receipt or registered the product I could have gotten some help from the manufacturer. Alas! This is a replacement and I am registering it today! I loved the original headphones, by far the best wireless headphones I have used. Just register your product or at least save your receipt!"
3,Sennheiser RS 120 over-ear 900 mhz wireless RF headphones with charger,"I do enjoy these ! The first set I had to send back did not work! BAD: The only problem I have is I am engrossed in a movie and all of a sudden I have very loud static in my ear! WOW!! I jump and take them off and put them in the charger. So they last only so long. Good : I can hear the TV while I am in other rooms and also when I take the dog out. I just have to prepare myself for the loud screech!! Also my mother comes to visit and puts the TV on loudest setting and it is so loud I have to leave the room, she now wears the headphones and we both are happy!"
4,works nicely,"Since my husband is extremely hard of hearing, and I have excellent hearing, when he watched the TV he would have the sound turned WAY up and it actually HURT my ears. I would wear EAR PLUGS to muffle the sound. Now he wears these nice headphones and we can turn the sound ALL the way off (actually MUTE the sound) while he can still hear the shows - or I can use the remote to turn up the sound to whatever level is right for me.The only think we do NOT like about these headphones is that the across-the-head top of the set is very WIDE with no way of adjusting it to get a snugger fit without fear of breaking/destroying it. The headphones fall off easily if my husband (or me - I tried them on too) look down... Otherwise, we love them and consider them to be a GOOD purchase."
4,very pleased with these earphones,"easy to hook up, very intuitive, no special skills or instructions. excellent range, loud and clear walking throughout the house.some static when I pause the DVR, but it clears immediately when I resume the program. comfortable, quality sound, certainly for most uses, like watching TV, or movies. charging light comes on when you return the headphones to its cradle/stand, nothing to plug in. just have to remember to turn them off when you take them off."
3,crackly,i ended up selling these because they had static and i was using the speakers for mixing music. stick with wired headphones
1,Lemon - Avoid,"This product stopped working after about 2 months. Return window expired, so I am at the mercy of Amazon. This is an example of how moving production to China makes buyers reviews useless -- manufacturer's name and model stay the same, quality plummets. IMO, Amazon should introduce ""Not made in China"" search tag."
1,Deal Zone seller sucks!,"I bought these headphones in late 2011 and a few weeks back they stopped working. The base unit does not show any of the status lights (charge, on/off) working. Since this is still under warranty I contacted Deal Zone for a copy of the bill with the serial number of the device on it (Sennheiser will not repair the unit for free without this kind of a bill) - I am still waiting to hear from Deal Zone. Do not buy from Deal Zone, buy from any other place that would give you a bill with the serial number, otherwise its almost a $100 (price when I bought it) down the drain."
4,Nice Product,"the headphone are huge, just to let u know. the reception is excellent for almost 100 yards"
2,Not too happy,I am dissapointed with these headphones because the tv needs to be too loud for others in order for the headphones to work. I purchesed these in order to hear the tv without disturbing my wife.
3,A Good set of headphones,"This set of headphones is good but not great as many reviews would lead you to believe. The sound quality is good, the fit is at best OK (they are on ear and do not lay flat) and may cause some issues with sound quality. The multiple channel feature is rather annoying and can cause a loud static session in your ear if not careful. I have become accustomed to using them but a novice user may find them difficult to use and get used to."
1,Too much feedback,"I ended up returning the product because there was just too much feedback.I have a lot of electronics in my house, especially in the living room which probably caused it. I even turned them all off and still i got bad feedback.For the most part, they are good, but i just couldn't take the continuous feedback and hissing."
2,Too much interference/distortion,I recently purchased these headphones and will be returning them because there is just too much interference. Will the RS-130's with the auto tuning feature fix this problem or will I just have to go with corded?
5,Better than previously owned wireless headphones,"Delivery of headphones was received within 48 hrs. My husband and I have used RCA headphones for the past two years. They served us well but since one set had to be taped together and the other only had sound in one ear we decided to find a different product. After researching the different brands and prices we decided to order the Sennheiser RS-12o Wireless Headphones from Amazon, as the price was considerably lower than offered by anyone else. Since using my headphones I now realized that the sound quality and the distance I can wander away from my TV and still have great sound is far superior than our previously owned headphones. I highly recommend this product"
3,Pick better options,"The sound quality is excellent. One drawback was the headset slips off the head. If you want a wireless headset go for a bluetooth headset so that you dont have to have the RF transmitter. I got a Blueant X5 and am very happy with the sound and no wire and no transmitter freedom. I later bought a Sony MDR-V700DJ, a wired one, to just blow my head off."
5,Works fine,"I don't like to write if you want more than me clicking on the rating, I guess that thei is the last you hear from me."
2,RS120,"The rs 120 wireless head phones work. The recharge is great and so is the listing time. But the main problem is the head phones are way to loose, if you move they fall off. Had I known this ahead of time I would have looked some where else"
1,Too much static,"The quality of the sound was terrible, I returned them immediately. Also, although it indicated they were 'ear cups' they didn't really cup over the ear."
1,Didn't work,I took this product out of the box & plugged it in. It would not power up. I returned it immediately for a refund.
2,"Noise, noise, noise.","Well the noise is horrible on this things, whether it's from picking up static or from auto gain I don't know. And I don't care. The fact that it's constantly in your ears a little and when the sound on tv is low you get a lot of the static noise (can deafen you) - has no excuse.I didn't return it because the charging station is very nice and I bought it so my wife won't bother me with blasting TV, so I don't really care about quality of her reality tv shows. But I wouldn't recommend those to anyone."
1,Shoddy quality,"Reception was always poor no matter how one tinkers with the configuration. Put them away, then decided to dig them out again recently. The left channel no longer works, a wiring issue no doubt. I would definitely NOT recommend these headphones."
1,Defective out of the box,"I ordered this for my husband's birthday. Sadly, it was defective -- when you plug it in it's supposed to start charging, and this one never did. Pretty lousy birthday surprise, eh?But wait, it gets worse. Because I ordered it in advance of my husband's birthday, to make sure I got it in time, my 30 day ""return window"" had expired by the time we discovered it was defective. So, Amazon refused to replace it for me, and actually charged me a $17 ""restocking fee"" for the privilege of taking back a completely non-functioning product!Moral of the story:1) Don't buy Sennheiser Wireless headphones and2) Don't buy electronic products from Amazon.Kathryn Campbell"
5,Excellent for hard of Hearing,"I used another headphone for many years until it conked out. It worked, but was marginal in providing understandable speech. I bought the Sennheiser 120 as a replacement based on reviews listed by other users. When I first put it to use it was WOW, what a difference. I have had the new headphones about a month, now, and I am still amazed each time I use them at the clarity of the sound, especially speech. My old ears are dancing to a new tune! Jim F"
2,The product worked great for the first 2 weeks.,"I have had this unit for 5 years in my house and have had no problems with it, ever. I decided to get one for my 92 year old father after he tried mine. Ordered the product and all was fine for the first 2 weeks then the tune wheel became hard to adjust and made the left side impossible to hear out of. Went online to Sennheiser 2 weeks ago and filled out their tech support page. To this day I have had no response, so the head phones sit idle. I would have called Amazon but from past experiences I would have been tolld to contact Sennheiser. Its a good product but not this one. 2 STARS"
4,Very good and quality headphone,I bought this headphone for my husband as a X-Mas gift. He loves it the sound quality is very good and very comfortable to wear
5,Great Wireless Headphones,"I bought the headphones last month. I originally had bought a wireless set from Sony, but I returned them due to awful sound and a lot of interference. Probably this was due to my wireless network as both were on the 2.4GHz frequence. That is why I wanted something with a different frequence, and the RS120 operate on the 926MHz. What a difference ! Excellent sound, very clear, great reception and no interference. On the comfort side, I guess they could be better but for the price I think is is a great buy overall. Make sure to turn up the volume high enough of your TV when trying the first time, so the headphones can detect the sound signal."
2,Hisssss!,"They are comfortable, easy to use and recharge.I hear a hiss, unless you turn them up loud. I have also noticed interference, with reception,when I move my arm up. The tuning I find also difficult. being too sentive.My husband, who has hearing problems, doesn't notice the hissing, and since they were purchased for him so I can sleep while he watches TV, they do the necessary job."
3,Had to be invented by a woman!,"These headphones are a gift to womankind everywhere! Had to have been invented by a woman whose man constantly watches TV. Peace and quiet! Hubby adores these! He said the sound quality is fantastic, NO static, he can move from room to room without losing signal and they are very comfortable to wear. Best Christmas gift I ever got him! High quality, great design, LONG battery life!"
2,Mixed results on RS120 Headphones,"After using RS 130 and 140 headphones, one set was replaced by the RS 120 (other models no longer available).The RS 120 is compatible with current base station and does receive signal within limited range. Sound quality much lower than other models. Headset is flimsy and does not fit well over ears; slips off head if head lowered for any reason. Would recommend RS 120 only if wanting to use with current 130 system and willing to accept lower quality product."
5,I love it,"A marriage saving device. I can listen while my wife across the room can listen to her book on tapes without bothering her.Also she can go to bed and doesn't have to be drowned out with the loud volume.Also, unlike line of sight units, you can walk around the house and still hear everything..Another neat function, when you aren't using it you can set it on the cradle provided and it will charge your rechargable batteries.I listen a lot during the day and it holds enough charge it doesn't run down, but, if you do, it is easy to put in new, fresh batteries"
4,Very Good headphones!,"I wont' get too technical since I really need it so I can watch my favorite shows without causing any stress with my other half who is soooo sensitive to sound any louder than ""low"" . The headphones have better sound than my Samsung tv so I am a happy camper!!"
3,good sound,"After about a year, the right ear stopped working, but being mostly deaf in the right ear, I really didn't notice for awhile. heavy with a noticable hiss. But mainly got it for TV watching. Good enough"
5,It is very good,"Bought this item because my friends bought it. It is very nice and convenient for listening tv, while doing something around the house. If you want to use while exersizing I recomend to put it on above the bandana for not sliding. Good sound quality and light weight."
2,Missing NiMH AAA Batteries,Missing NiMH AAA Batteries. I will not return this order until I buy batteries and try it out. New batteries cost about as much as shipping it back. Right now I am disappointed about the delay in putting the product to use and the level of quality control in assembling the shipment. OOPS. I found them in the hidden compartment.I will modify my review after checking it out.
1,Spend some extra money and get something that works,"I love Sennheiser, but these headphones are crap. I bought two pairs for my grandfather-in-law and both failed after he used them for a month. It's outside Amazon's return window unfortunately, and after reading about Sennheiser's poor customer support it looks like I am out $160. My advice is to spend some extra money and get a product that works."
4,Good,"The headphone provides good to excellent sound quality. However, it tends to slip away from your ears quite easily."
4,Great For Non-serious Listeners,"I watch my TV/DVDs and listen to music mainly late at night, and always find it unsatisfactory to do it at low volumes for obavious reasons. Since the listening distance is long (4 meters), I wanted a wireless headphones and the RS 120 does its job well.The setup is a breeze. The fit is comfortable, though it gets a bit warm after 30 minutes (I stay in a tropical country).The souund is comparable to that of HD 497, which is no mean feat.There is no hiss/static at my usual listening position. However, there is a noticiable hiss when I go upstairs to my study to do my computer stuff (no diff if computer is on or off), which I cannot get rid of no matter what I do.Overall, I would say this is an excellent buy."
4,Great headphones for the average user,"Just got my pair in a few days ago, and I love the headphones. Sounds is totally clear throughout my apartment without any static or fading (the transmitter location was very important, by the way -- too close to my computer speakers and the reception suffered).Frequency response of the unit could be a little better... bass is somewhat bad, actually, so those of you who want to feel your music had better go with another unit, but midrange is excellent, very clear, and high treble is pretty decent, too.Batteries have lasted over 12 hours now without recharging, and still I have great reception.The headphones are fairly comfortable. I haven't worn them 30+ minutes yet, but the time that I had them on, I didn't mind the feel at all. Earpads are soft, too.All in all, I'm happy...."
4,Sennheiser RS 120 wireless earphones,"I got these because my hearing is failing, so I can't comment on frequency range ... I use them from my Tivo ... worked as advertised and my wife is much happier (no blaring TV)... reception is great in house ... even passable reception in my all steel shop 50 feet from house ... I can now hear the audio clearly of the shows I watch and the background music (didn't know there was so much) ... only critisism is that the earphones are pretty much a fixed position, not much adjustment and fall off if I bend over.update August 2009 ... replaced the rechargeable batteries this year ... simple .these Sennheiser RS120s are still serving me well ...sointantly getting my money's worth !:o)"
1,Didn't work,"My wife and I will use these to listen to books / TV shows through a Kindle fire while rocking our newborn to sleep. I was very excited to cut the cable, since it is tricky to manage with a little one snoozing in your arms. However, the base would only keep the input signal for an hour or so and then disconnect. The headphones still worked, the base charging light still went on, but the green signal light went out, and so did the audio.Because of all the great reviews I figured we must have got an odd error, so I exchanged them, but the next set had the same problem."
2,Uncomfortable,"Easy connect, okay sound but very uncomfortable. Worst of all, whenever I bend over or look down they fall off. Kind of like that pair of glasses that keep sliding down your nose. While there is an length adjustment there is no width adjustment."
3,Solid headphones for the price,"Pros-solid construction-above average audio quality-aesthetically pleasing mounting/recharge dock-good battery life-replaceable rechargeable batteries-comfortable even during prolonged useCons-only comes with R/L audio cables. Most newer tv's only have optical output so you may need to buy an adapter.-slight background buzzing at times-they are bulky, so if you like to lay on your side while watching tv, it may cause a problemOverall I like these, and I would have given them a four out of five it they had an adapter for optical audio outputs."
4,Head set,"Got a head set because my wife's hearing is better than mine and doesn't need the TV volume as high as I do. Works good, hooks up fast."
2,Constant low buzz sound no matter where I place the base or tune it,"I was highly anticipating these wireless headphones as the only other pair of wireless headphones I used were 40 bucks and terrible. That was years ago, I was hoping these would be different, but they're not. They have good sound quality but theres a constant buzz/humming noise no matter where I place the base and no matter how I tune the frequency, that is completely unacceptable as I just wanted headphones to have on while in my office so I could just walk around from time to time, lay down on the couch, and still be isolated with my music.I just received the headphones today, tried them out for a couple hours, returning them. I will never try wireless again, the loss in audio quality is just not worth it."
5,Excellent,I wasn't so sure when I first opened the box- it looked flimsy and I didn't think it was going to be a hit. The quality of sound and strength of the connection are superior
3,Auto Turnoff Feature,"I'm surprise no one has mentioned the auto-turnoff feature (more like a royal pain than a positive feature) to these headphones. Yes, the sound is good. When they're ON. However (and I wasn't aware of this when I bought them or I would have looked at something different) these headphones have an auto-turnoff feature that will turn the receiving base off in the middle of using them. *screeeeeeeeech*, the headphone base goes off and you suddenly have an earful of static. LOUD static. That makes you jump out of your chair. Flipping the on/off switch on the headphones themselves doesn't fix it. You have to unplug the base and then plug it back in again to get a new signal. Sound quality? Yeah, they're great. Being blasted with static in the middle of listening to something and having to unplug the unit to get the signal back? Very bad."
1,Nothing Special-unhappy,"The right headphone speaker goes in and out. The headphones fit poorly; actually drop off my head if I bend over. There is no red light on the headphones to tell you that they are on. Neither the distance nor the quality is any better than my old, cheap Panasonic ones. If I go into another room ~30-40 feet away especially if there is a wall between the headphones and the transmitter I begin to get hiss and interference. UPDATE-Lowered Star rating-after time you find the tuner and volume control mechanism start to fail-still using them but it is a royal pain. If someone changes settings then you can spend half an hour trying to re-balance the tuner and volume wheels. The only positive note is that my off the shelf rechargeable batteries work fine."
5,Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones-Good Sound,"I like the RS-120 wireless headphones. Light weight, comfortable, good sound. Work well on my treadmill. I like the fact that I can simply place them back on the attractive stand and they are automatically connected to the charger. I do not have to connect a charger cord. The instructions say that they cannot over-charge. They are expensive, however."
2,Hissssssssssssssssssssssssssss,"These headphones have some good points: comfort, easy set-up out of the box, good directions, and they are attractive. Unfortunately, I hear a constant HISSS when wearing them. Not always a loud hiss, but always detectable, and sometimes quite annoying. This may be the nature of the FM signal. Also, I get about 20-30 feet from the base & I start getting annoying interference (I would estimate the range to be just shy of the distance from my sofa to my bathroom). Last, if the phones don't detect a signal, they go to LOUD WHITE NOISE!!!!!!!!! Don't try muting the commercials!!"
2,"Those giving one star are correct, do not understand other ratings","I had previously owned RS 45's and they were lost. RS-120 looked good, so I ordered online. Have always hated them. You bend over, they fall off, they do not enclose the ear, they sit on it, very limited range in my home. I am going to order another set of 45's, even though you must handle carefully as they are fragile. But are far more comfortable and seem to have better range and less hissing in my home anyway."
1,did not work for me,All I had was static. I sent it back no trouble doing this.No trouble with receiving my refund.
1,Going to return this soon,"#1. The static & hiss of the FM frequencies just don't work. I tried all the channels, and clearing the receiver away from electronic devices. Still, hisses when you move, loses the channel occasionally, static at other times. The distortion is absolutely maddening! Must be poor quality control on their part. It's a piece of crap. Why pay for this product when for say, $10-20 more, you can get bluetooth headphones which NEVER hiss and have 100% sound transmission without interference. This product is fail#2. the materials are cheap and don't feel that comfortable on your head.#3. the cheap materials don't dampen the sound very well outside, therefore, someone could be 10-20 feet away trying to sleep and STILL here the sound coming out of the earphones...I'll be returning this and am looking for a bluetooth headset,"
2,Seller is great but the product is bad,Hi!It is not worth the price because it has lot of interference . The clarity is bad.
4,almost perfect,"I purchased two pair, one for my wife and one for me. Use them only for TV and the sound great.Only problem is if you turn your head in one certain way you get some static.I fixed that by moving the base unit."
1,"Buyer beware, complete junk",My wife bought these for me to use because she has an ear condition by which she cannot tolerate sound very well. I tried them and the sound keeps cutting out. They are unusable and Amazon shouldn't even be selling such a defective product. Beware.
1,Never got to try them,"I received the headphones today and hooked everything up per the instructions. The lights would not come on when I plugged the wall jack in. Looks like other people had the same problem. The company obviously does not have the proper quality controls in place. Maybe Amazon should offer wireless headphones, I am still on the first generation Kindle and it works great!!I will be sending these back to Amazon tomorrow."
2,Static Noise and Short Range,"I'll make it short. This is an awful pair of wireless headphones ever. Here's why:Static Noise - I hear the hiss sound all the times, yes that hiss out-of-band sound when you tune your FM radio. Although it's faint, it's quite noticeable and annoying. When I move or even just moving arms up/down, the noises get louder to compete with the music.Short Range - 120ft? I walked 10 feet away, and already the sound degrades so much, and to compound the issue, radio noises get louder as I get farther until all I could hear is loud static.Two stars as it's at least wireless. There's no tangling wire to limit me from moving although moving would produce hiss sound.If I could turn back the time, I would get a digital wireless headphones instead. It may be better at handling the signals and the hiss and noise could go away."
4,wireless headphones,"the earphones perform very well, and allows others in the room to have normal TV volume while a person with hearing difficulty can have great sound"
2,Tuner dial is a pain,I replaced my original pair of headphones of the same brand with this model. This must be a different model than my original headphones. The 10-level tuning push button on my original pair is was replaced with a tuning wheel on the new set. My mother in law is hard of hearing and uses the headphones which allows my wife and I to hear our TV in the other room. Unfortunately my mother in-law also has no manual dexterity and she is constantly touching the tuning wheel loosing the audio.Make sure you upgrade to the model with the tuning button if the headphone are for an elderly person.
4,Solid Wireless Headphones for the home...,"I've been using these for about an hour or two at night after my GF goes to sleep and they are great. I am using them with my receiver and the sound is good. The range, which I haven't tested the limits off, seems good as I have no problems throughout the apartment even when in other rooms. The hiss is only audible when the volume is dialed up. I mostly use it for TV, so I don't know how the sound is for audiophiles..."
2,"Great company, questionable product","Sennheiser has been one of the leading headphone manufacturers foryears and when I was looking for headphones for the work computerand saw these it seemed like a no brainer to purchase them.While they sound great when working properly, they cut in and outrepeatedly and lose sound at times due to what seems to bebad connections to the earpieces. This happens to a lot ofelectronics firms when they try and move to the lower end ofthe price spectrum (witness the lack of quality of Bose since theythey started mass producing the home theater line). Because of this problem I cannotrecommend this product."
4,Wireless headphone has no real weaknesses,"This headphone exhibits the usual Sennheiser quality and attention to detail. Keep in mind that this is an analog set, not one of the newer digital variety.Sound quality is fine, reception good. Battery life seems OK but no real data yet - it has been used for about 12 ""on"" hours without needing to be recharged.The ergonomics of the base station/charger unit are the same as in previous Sennheiser models, a bit too large and visible for my taste. Also a fairly large opening vertically is needed to place the headphone unit on the charger stand (about 8"").The phones fit my head fine but the pads are fairly firm - definitely not 'cushion' fit. Allows a bit more external noise than I would like. However, they are comfortable enough after an hour or two.Bottom line: this is a capable wireless headphone, and for the money, an outstanding value."
4,Not up to expectations,"A friend recommended these and I was of the understanding that you could turn the tv volumn down to 0 and still listen comfortably loud on the headphones. Well, that is not what I got, we have to leave the volumn up a little on the tv set to still be able to get a good loud volumn on the headphones. We can still use these headphones in our situation but I thought they would be better than they are."
2,Sennheiser Wireless headphones,The wireless headphones did a good job of amplifying sound from the TV. I found that the earphones were uncomfortably warm when worn for a half hour or more.
2,Overpriced and poor design,"While the headphones themselves are really nice compared to nothing, I would really not advise anyone to get them at this price.If they don't have an audio feed, say if you have a game or movie paused, for more than five minutes they start with a loud hiss and pop that may have already damaged the drivers themselves.Pretty uncomfortable for a wireless set, the foam and design of the earpads are like a form of torture after an hour.Very disappointed, I got a wired gaming headset recently for a bit more in price and the difference and experience is drastically better.My opinion, DON'T BUY. Get a cheaper set of wireless headphones that have the same quality, or just pay a bit more for something a lot better. That is up to you to decide."
2,Attractive looking but not worth the money for the quality,"It's really hard to adjust the transmitter and channel to optimize sound quality. The louder the volume, the worse the sound quality and the more static noise. I really don't know why Sennheiser make this bad product with high price."
1,BAD DECISION,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas and they have never worked. Contacted company for assistance, but they were wholly unhelpful and unwilling to do anything about it. I will never purchase a product from this company again."
4,Great Wireless Headphones,"The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the ear paddings do not surround the ear completely. If you bend down with the earphones on, they have the tendency to slide off the ears. Otherwise, the sound is great!!"
5,"Purchased on September 23, 2008 - still working","You can find pros and cons in the other reviews.I purchased headpohones on September 23, 2008 - still working."
2,Uncomfortable and mediocre sound,"I will be returning these. After all the positive reviews these seemed like a bargain, but they were incredibly disappointing. My biggest complaint is that these are very uncomfortable. Unlike other large headphones which use a soft rubber ring around the earpieces, these are just flat with a scratchy soft material covering them. I cannot imagine wearing these through an entire movie. They are hot on your head and make your ears hurt after 10 minutes or so. The sound is mediocre at best with a fairly noticeable hiss. I really wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Save your money and buy something better."
1,Unreliable--possibly because of the automatic shut-off,"Perhaps I've just been unlucky, but I have found the Sennheiser headphones extremely unreliable. I was very pleased when I first purchased the unit--after less than a week they went dead; i.e., the charger continued to work, but no transmission. I returned the unit and got a replacement. My only annoyance was that, occasionally, it would simply cut off. Gradually this became more common and annoying. I knew it had a 2 year warranty, but didn't realize I had owned it as long as I had. Finally last month, it became impossible to use because of the constant shut-offs. When I checked my warranty & sales slip, I realized I had owned it for two months beyond the warranty. When I prepared to order another one, I mentioned it to my son. Turned out, he had the same problem with his Sennheiser PS 120 and--though he didn't return it--he doesn't use it any more because of the sound cut-off. I realize that any product can have a lemon, but 3 out of 3?"
3,Will not stay put,Due to the 'open' design of these headphones they will not stay put over your ears. Even the slightest head movement and they tend to fall off. They will be going on eBay!!They do have fair sound quality but too much bass for me.Those with BTE hearing aids should avoid these phones.John
2,Not what I expected,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging CradleThe reviews here on Amazon appear to be mixed on this model from Sennheiser. One of the issues is the hissing that may be audible while the unit is operating. I took a chance and bought a set. Well I can report the unit I received did have significant hissing. I checked the input source (TV) with cabled-headphones to ensure it was not the cause of the hissing. I tried using the tuning feature on the headphones to reduce/eliminate the hiss but to no avail. I ended up returning the unit for a refund.
2,Reception poor,"Headphones are nice and comfortable, by the static is pretty bad. I tried moving the base and playing with the tuning, but the amount of static has not greatly improved. Would have rather got something else."
4,Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones.,"I have had trouble finding a good pair of headphones that will help with my failing hearing. The sound quality and weight of these is perfect and I enjoy hearing every word now. My only complaint is that the headband is too loose and cannot be adjusted. When I lean my head forward they fall off my head which is a real problem. Most other headphones have a tension adjustment that gives a level of grip to the head, I wish these did.Overcoming that design flaw would make these headphones nearly perfect."
3,No more whining wife.,Finally now I can watch a movie without her complaining that it is too loud or me wondering if it was a silent movie when the volume is comfortable for her.A little hiss & if I turn the volume down I hear what sounds like an echo. But good overall reception with range over 100' so I can even go out to the shop & still hear.
2,needs work,Sennheiser RS120 the transmitter was the problem. It was an automatic feature but it went on/off at inappropriate time. While listening it would go off and while charging it would go on. Sometimes it worked properly. I had to turn on the audio feature of my TV in order to channel the sound through the headphones. I even unplugged the connection and the green transmission light went on! I returned the product. Ross Williams
3,You can use more than two headset at the same time. So So Product.,"I need this kind of headset when I watch a movie at night when my kids sleep.I chose this one because of the brand name, Sennheiser.This wireless headset is my first one. After that, I bought another USB wireless headset(Logitech Brand).Installation is super easy.This headset use RF channel and it means that the frequency can be used by another device or people.When it works, it is good.But sometimes when I watch a movie, I can listen another sound or noise. But not often.Whenever I meet this problem, just wait or change frequency.I bought two of it for me and my wife.If you want to use two headset from one same source like TV, you don't need to install two of station.Two headset shares one station.When I tried it first, I installed two station and of course, it was not working."
4,Worth the search,"After a disappointing experience with another wireless headset, this was a great buy. I'd paid the same price for an infrared headset that cut out when someone walked in front of the tv or I walked out of the line of sight. This headset offers great clarity, ease of charging, and there is no interference when I use it to watch television while using the treadmill. The Sennheiser name was a big selling point, and I wasn't disappointed. I only wish I'd saved the money I spent on the other purchase so I could buy two of these! The only complaint is that the volume control is on the same side as the tuning wheel and you have to be careful to adjust the right one. Otherwise, I love this headset!"
2,Dissapointment,I was unable to get them to work. I carefully followed the instructions for connecting them but I never got anything but static from them.
5,Love these things,"I have had the RS110 for 4-5 years and the RS 120 for 3-4 years now. Love both of them. Have enjoyed good range from them, walls don't make a big difference but then I'm not an audiophile and tend not to use these for music. Since I have both - I can easily switch either headset to either source transmitter. Currently 1 of my sources is linked to my receiver's zone 2 output - so I can listen to all my input hooked to it and in case either headset runs out of battery I can quickly switch over to the other one.I use it for listening to the news (radio or tv). I am extremely happy with my purchases, though the fit could be better it does make me think that perhaps if the fit was tighter I would not find them as comfortable. The battery charge (RS110 uses batteries) lasts a while as do the inbuilt batteries in the RS120, it helps that I can recharge batteries for both headsets.Well worth the purchase for me and the flexibility is much welcomed."
4,Pretty good,"I bought these ear phones so I could stop the ""volume"" wars every night with my wife as we both watched separate TV shows or I played Call of Duty. I found that the sound is great, but is really susceptible to interference. From what I've read it's a problem with all wireless head sets. These were a great substitute for the Logitech ""gaming"" headset that costs twice as much. I run the voice that usually comes through the ear piece into the head set, then attach the Bluetooth ear-bud to my collar and things work fine."
3,Good Sound but...,"The headphones worked great for the 1st week. Then the left ear went weak despite tuning and trying different transmit-channels, but it came back. The tuning is too sensitive and becomes hit & miss. This is a shame because when it works, the sound is great. In all honesty it may be just this one unit...the next one may work fine."
1,headphones,"Does not work, Amazon not available to help exchange, emailed company to help on tech support and not a call or email on support. Wanted to return but Amazon nor Sennheiser replied with the how to'sOn my TV it DOES NOT WORK"
2,too much white noise and static,I can never adjust the channel perfectly to not hear static on these. Static noise render this unit useless. I rarely use it. I regret this purchase and would return it if I hadn't thrown away the packaging.
2,cordless headphones,"I was unable to get the system to work with my TV. It did work with my CD player, but only for a very short time, then it shut down. There has to be a problem with the transmitter. I returned the system. I am hoping the next one I get will work as it should. I know it is a good system, as a friend has one."
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"<<The following review is in my son's own words. He has had a very disappointing experience with these headphones, and Sennheiser's customer service was unwilling to help him (they told him to send the headphones back for evaluation, but that any repair charges would be to him). I would hate to think that they were unresponsive because he is not an adult?>>After my experience with these headphones, I will never buy another sennheiser product again. I hear static and tics through the headphones. I have called and called, even memorized the phone number, I'v called so many times. If you think, ok, so only one bad review, this bad review counts for a million bad reviews. I wish I could rate sennheiser at negative 5 stars."
5,Headphones,Product was recommended by my brother and he had tried several other brands. I use it every night and it has improved our quality of life.
3,"Close, but no cigar.","Why does this product have an analog tuning wheel? Digital PLL tuning has been around for decades now, and the base unit only has three frequencies. It would have been so much better to just have a three position switch on the headphones as well. And whose idea was it to have that tuning wheel right next to the volume control? I guess I'll eventually remember which is which, unless I return the unit and try again."
5,Great Set of Wireless headphones,"This is a great set of headphones. It's leaps and bounds ahead of the wireless headphones I've tried in the past. The charging station is great (the metal stand charges the headphones), the sound quality is excellent, and no interference even though the base sits directly behind my TV.My baby can sleep while I shoot people on my PS3. What more can I ask for?"
4,excellent product for the price,"This provides clear reception for everyday audio. There is a background humming before your audio comes on, but not noticeable once it's in use. Considering this is 20% of the cost of high end models, it's well worth it."
5,"Fabulous, except one small fixable problem","These headphones worked perfectly out of the box. After their initial 1-day battery charge, I plugged them into the TV, turned them on, and was blown away by their quality. Great sound reproduction and lightweight. I can hear them in any room in my apartment. I can even stand out on the deck, close the door, and still hear them perfectly without any hiss. Easy to recharge becaue they just lay across the top of the charger cradle.My only complaint: they fall forward if you tip your head down for an extended time. This didn't affect my 5-star rating, though. I just attached an eyeglasses strap (crokie) around each side. I place the strap around the back of my head, and cinch it up when I need to. Then I can cook or whatever without them falling into the frying pan. Not too ugly because my hair covers it up. Great headphones at a good price. Amazon delivered them quickly, too."
5,Wireless headphones that really work!,I have used these headphones a half-dozen times now and have been quite happy with their performance. There has been very little to no interference in the audio quality coming from from my TV.I have also walked throughout the house with the headphones on with no loss of signal.Overall this has been a great product.
3,Not too bad,"I purchased these to replace a similar JVC unit that had finally burned out after 7 years of use. The box claims a 500 ft range, but It is more like 250 ft. It adequately covers my 1 acre yard, but it pops and hisses beginning at about 50 ft. Sound is good, and I have no problem with the charging arrangement. The headphones fit rather loosely, which can be a problem if doing any yard work. Overall, not too bad."
4,Head set,I love the quality of the sound with this wireless headset. The only negative is that the headset sits a little to loose on my head and there is no way to adjust the width of.
4,Good for watching TV and not disturbing Hubby!,"The very comfortable Radio Shack unit I used has been discontinued. Unfortunately, that unit had to be replaced often and is no longer available. The Sennheiser seems more reliable, has good sound and excellent range -- even several rooms away from the transmitter. I just wish it was smaller and a bit more comfortable for use when lying in bed to watch television I'm glad that I purchased the unit with rechargeable batteries as it is nice not to have to replace batteries and likely is more economical in the long run."
2,Cheap but not at all effective,"Whilst in America I decided to purchase a tooth whitening product (because whitening products with peroxide in the aren't publicly sold in the UK). This particular product caught my eye because of the price and the claim that it is easy to use.I did not find it easy to use at all. It is very hard to keep your mouth dry while applying the gel and you'll find that it just runs off with the saliva. Once I had ""invented"" a way to keep my mouth dry (by putting tissue paper under my tongue) I still didn't notice any whitening. I continued using it for a few days but gave up because my teeth weren't whitening at all. I recently purchased Crest Whitestrips and they are ten times better than Colgate Simply White Night. I am only half way through the treatment and my teeth are already noticeably whiter and they only cost a few dollars more. So take my advice, buy Crest Whitestrips instead of this poor product."
2,A Collector Item But Stick To The Early Devo,"I got this album to complete my Devo collection. I had the original 1990 release and thought when I got this one I would go back over & give it a listen. Well, this version from 1994 on the Restless Records label (out of print and EXTREMELY hard to find)is still just ""OK"" with me. The other thing that you should know is that many sellers SAY they have the 14 track version but you order it, you get the 11 track version. So beware and ask the seller first or get multiple copies that are wrong. So if your looking to complete a Devo collection, then get this one but the album is far from a great record. Stick with the first four Devo albums. Search Judemac Forever on msn, Yahoo or Google."
4,Devo wnet out with a BANG,"This Cd isn't devo's worst(HArdcore devo is) it proves that Devo still has it in them. How many Post Post-Modern Man remixs are there? I think there is 8. 3 remixes and the orginal. If you can find a new copy I'd get it (**rykodisc.com**), but if youre a serious Devo fan. Other wise just go find the Post Post Modern Man EP."
2,Not their best--to say the least,"This CD should be an embarrassment to the band. It appears that they reunited at the dawn of the '90s, only to recycle some of the worst cliches of the '80s. The production techniques were already dated when they made this CD, and are TERRIBLY dated now. The songs are pathetically weak, the vocals and lyrics are lame--just awful, even laughable (and not in a cool way like Duty Now for the Future). Not even for the fans--I'm a fan, and I wish I'd never heard it. Buy the early stuff instead, for God's sake."
4,A Brainy Bye Bye,"DEVO had one more album in them before Mark Mothersbaugh decided there was more to be done scoring ""Rugrats"" cartoons, Disney cable shows and movie soundtrack work. ""Smooth Noodle Maps"" (the title refers to the patterns on the surface of a human brain) plays to all the strengths of their ""Freedom Of Choice"" salad days. The guitars are back among the electronics, and the compositions are hooky and dance floor smart. The one-two punch of ""Stuck In A Loop Again"" and ""Post Post Modern Man"" reinvigorate the theory of de-evolution in a powerful fashion, with a great deal of zip. They even throw in a DEVO-esque cover of the ancient ""Morning Dew"" (probably best known as a Grateful Dead favorite) to prove they still have what it takes to twist an oldie. They may have lost most of their sense of societal irony, but with the nasty ""Jimmy"" and the burned out relationship blues of ""Dawghaus,"" DEVO at least could claim they closed up shop with a solid recording."

4,DEVOTE,"Great CD, Wish I had the LP. Mastered a bit too loud however, had to turn it way down compared to most other CDs. Wonder Why? New CD from them in the Fall, can't wait!"
4,an underappreciated gem in the Devo catalog,"This album is a huge step up from Total Devo. I like Total Devo, but it's easily the band's worst album. This one has better songs, better flow, and better production. It actually feels like a Devo album. If you think Devo went downhill after Freedom of Choice, you may not like this CD much, but the rest of you will find something to like here. Devo Has Feelings Too is actually one of my favorite Devo songs, so I recommend this for that song alone, but the rest of it is pretty good too."
4,Devo or Blancmange?,"If you are a fan of early Devo, it would be understandable why you wouldn't like this album too much. But if you are a fan of New Wave bands such as Blancmange, the B-52s or Visage, you will probably like SmoothNoodleMaps more than Devo's early work.Devo definitely matured on this album, but at what price? They lost much of their ""punkness"" that made them the electronic Ramones. Is that a bad thing? Well, it depends on your tastes. If you have a broad liking to New Wave music, then despite the fact that SmoothNoodleMaps is definitely a change of pace for the band, you will probably still like it. It is much more polished than their early work. To me that's a good thing, but I still miss the ""rawness"" of their first albums.So that's probably the most vague review you'll read. This album is Devo and it is not Devo, but overall it is a well produced and smooth work. Whether that suites your Devo tastes is up to you!"
1,Don't Bother,"I have a large movie and music and photo collection stored on a ReadyNAS and I hoped to use this usint to play the media through the network onto my TV. My needs are simple so I thought that this unit might be for me. I had no trouble getting the unit set up and working but during playback the unit stutters sporadically and then locks up. The only way to recover is to do a cold start by unplugging the unit.Another user said that using an external harddrive solved this problem but my collection is too large for this solution so bak to Amazon it goes.I have since tried several other units including the Popcorn Hour A-100, Netgear EVA8000, TVIX 6500A, and the SageTV media extender. Each of these units are somewhat more expensive than the DSM-510 and each has its quirks but at least they work. In my opinion if you want a media player device spend the extra money and buy a good one. Otherwise you will just be frustrated."
4,Great Book!,"Perfect Challenge was a very good book. It wasn't wonderful or spectacular, in my opinion, but I liked it. I like Melanie, because she's so different than Ashleigh or Christina. Ashleigh and Christina are kind of too perfect for me. Melanie's spunky and determined. I also like Image. Image is so different from all the other horses in this series, and it's a nice change. Sometimes Image gets me a little frustrated. But still, when Image is around, it's never boring. Though Image is DEFINITELY not a Wonder. Anyway, the book is a little slow at first, but it picks up and is definitely exciting at the end. I was really happy that Jazz and Melanie were finally together--Jazz is SO nice! (But seriously, what parents name their kid Jazz?) I adore Baby--Image's tiny friend! She was so adorable! The only complaints I have is that you have to stick with the book because sometimes it gets a little bit dull."
5,whats rong with me!,"at the end of this book i found that i was disaponted that Image came in 2 place in the Florida Derby.(it must be the books with cristina and cindy, they always win).but its not so bad.Any way it was a good book and i reccomend it to all horse lovers and racing fans."
3,Okay Book,"Well, this wasn't the best Thoroughbred book ever written, but it wasn't the worst either. I didn't read this book the whole way through right away, because it wasn't exciting. The first like two chapters were about how much noise Image was making in the trailer. Boring! And second Chris and Parker broke up in the last book, so uh, what is it with Chris and her BOYFRIEND Parker having problems, when they clearly broke up in the last book. So, why did they say they were still going out, but having problems. I liked the fact that Mel and Jazz finally kissed and are starting to ""go out"". What was with Whitebrook being mentioned once, in one single tow page PHONE CALL! And they didn't say anything about Star, but in the Star books they always talk about Image. So, this was an OKAY book, but it could have been TONS better and I am hoping that the next one is better and that I will read it in one day like I usually do!"
3,too expensive for quality,"shipment was fast, however once I received product, I feel it was not worth the price that I had paid. I just hope the adhesive holds."
5,Works,I've been using this for years. It works for the various reasons I wanted it for. I get it on subscription.
2,Way to Small,I thought this product was way to small. It was not what i expected at all. It says eight and up but is way to small for any child to have a tea party with and actually use. Looks more like a decoration then something you could play with.
4,cute tea set,"Cute tea set. Nice size for little girls. Sturdy, pretty pink case, but keep the plastic inserts. Home lead test read negitive-BIG PLUS."
2,poor does not last long,came broken and we had to wait two months for a replacement (it was a christmas gift). second one did not last long.
2,order,"Pls be sure that you order qty 2, see i tought they were sellin the pair but i was wrong, its individual.."
4,Interesting point of view,"This little book tries to gives an explanation to a well known fact : there are more idiots in this world that you can ever imagine. The laws are both funny and sadly so true! It gets a little redundant at the end, but it still is 70 pages of entertainement."
1,just plain stupid,"this whole thing is a bad joke based on a bunch of inaccurate stereotypes...but if blatant ignorance and a genuine lack of creative humor is your thing, then I'd say go for it..."
5,Dis is da bomb,"I bought this as a gag gift and it's hilarious. Complete with tests and every single move to become a ho, its highly entertaining. You can be a hip hop hater, a neutral hip hop person or even like hip hop to appreciate the humor and uniqueness of this phat guide...."
5,Great Mouthpiece!,I purchased this since it was reccommended to me by my saxophone professor. It's the best mouthpiece for playing classical music I've ever played on! I've been playing now for 10 years! I've even played a few cool jazz shows with it too.
3,witness Vader's horrific transformation,"The funnest part is to rebuild vader, but after you rebuild him he look's a little awkward. With his plastic cape on, he dosen't stand very well, in addition his shoulders should have been bigger. His arms only move up and down and eventually his helmet would fall off easily. This great for a diorama and an okay toy, but i think Hasbro could have done better."
4,Good,"This toy is awesome. But it would be better if it had an interchanble hand with anakins left arm cut off by obi wan, legs withtought grey amputations, and instead of him having a red face he should have had his burned up nasty face. Those things would have made this toy the best."
1,Dwight,"I never received the toy, it took me two emails and about and hour finding a contact number for Amazon. This was my first and only order thru Amazon. To no success my son did not get his toy. However once I was able to get a reply from Amazon staff I did get my refund on time. Excellent business!!"
2,Not good quality. And the sizing is all wrong...,I was pretty dissapointed when I bought these shoes. They look great in the photo but they have the sizing all wrong.. They run a complete size larger on many of their lines and you cant tell which lines are sized correctly and which arent... its a toss of the coin.I bought these in a size 9 but they really were a 10. They were a complete inch larger than my foot! I couldlnt believe it... I have tried other shoes of theirs and Id have to say 80% are sized too large...Its not worth the gamble...
1,No more confusion,"I bought this book thinking it was Brandon Boyd of Incubus. partly because the book is being sold with Incubus CD's but after receving the book and reading it I was not too sure. not to say its not a good book its okay, just a little mushy. Than after going to the book signing on May 12th some girls brought this book for Brandon to sign and he did not even know this book existed. so I just wanted to let everyone know as to not be confused this is NOT a Brandon Boyd of Incubus book.And thank you to Brandon for clearing things up!!!"
1,This book was awful. Don't waste your $,Just to let you know. I was a sucker and bought it. I thought it was Brandon Boyd from Incubus but to my dismay it wasn't. Whoever published this stupid book really needs to reevaluate there career choice. This was an awful book. Most of the book has one to two sentances per page....... If you put all the sentences together you get a 10 page book. not to mention the book was way to mushy for even me and thats bad. Anyways don't wast your time.
1,Not what I was expecting,"First off, this book is not written by Brandon Boyd lead singer of incubus. That was the soul purpose why I bought this book. Me being such a huge incubus fan found it hard to believe the lead singer himself wrote this. I am not a romantic person nor do I like to read it. Keep in Mind this is only my opinion and if you like romantics then you might like this book."
2,Pretty cover.,"This is not the Brandon Boyd from Incubus, however, it's a pretty cool book. But definitely not the same intellectual fool."
5,WHY RATE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ,"Sorry, but as an Incubus fan, I think it's unfair to give a 1 rating to a book that A. you haven't read, B. YOU were misled by, C. the maturity level of some ""fans"" brings down... said level really shines through.... so I thought I'd help out and give a positive review; though, this isn't by the beloved Incubus lead singer. Also, if you were much of a fan at all, you'd have known that ""White Fluffy Clouds"" was Brandon's first book... and I'm not even into knowing the ""hardcore facts"" of the band!"
4,I Loved it!!,Hers is beauty was an awesome book it set me in a place were I would love to be it had so much passion adn warmth in it.....it made me want a guy like that sooo bad hahaha but yah this is a great book buy it NOWLUV YA ALLKristin C.
1,whoa!!,"okay so i haven't actually read this book but i did some further research and have found it to be true that it was IN NO WAY written by brandon boyd of incubus. if you are curious there is a website with a picture of the author and where you can buy the book. something like outcrybookreview.comfyi--the author bears a striking resemblance to the host of a favorite childhood television show, reading rainbow"
3,Nice Quality Poor Function,"I bought this doll to assist in potty training my boy.Compared to what I found available this doll is the most beautiful and highest quality materials. Paul is uncircumcised anatomically correct with eyes that open & close and fine attention to detail, folds in the skin, belly button etc... He is a great learning tool to teach body parts but not so great to teach a boy about peeing. I followed the instructions and I could not get Paul to pee in his potty the water seems to leak out of his neck. Based on price and effectivness as a potty training tool I can not reccomend Paul for potty training purposes. I have found that a cheaper Fisher Price doll that is not anatomically acurate is a better tool for potty training. I needed pee accuracy more than anatomic accuracy."
2,Leaked everywhere!,"I was really excited to get this toy...I had heard good reviews. However, before I had my son try it (to help him with potty training) I wanted to try it out myself. I could not get the doll to take the water, it just leaked everywhere. I was very unsatisfied and I ended up returning the doll. I would not recommend it if you plan to use it for potty training."
2,COOL BUT NOISEY,"Either i have purchased a lemon or this model is entirely too noisey.I have 500+ square ft. and this model has the recommended btu output (11700), however this still does not place the unit far enough away so as not to be a noisey industrial like disturbance."
2,Too SMALL,"These labels were just too small to be return address labels. When printing, the labels would not line up correctly in the printer (yes, I made sure I had inserted them properly and used the correct Avery label with Word). I tried changing the size of my font but then it would be too small. I wnet up a size on the font then it would be too big. I think these labels would best be used as one line labels and not return address labels."
4,refined riot grrl at it's best,"This mature debut full length album from Babes front woman Kat Bjelland proves that riot grrls can become riot women and still do a damn fine job of it. Bjelland's raw 'babesque' sound has matured and melodified into a work of variation, emotion and energy which mixes edgy rock'infused ballads such as 'rosacea' with the good old raging grunge guitars and screaming vocals.Bjelland has traded in explicit lyrics for baby backing vocals, which,... proves that this is just as much a stepping stone in her life as it is a collaboration of her work to date.Babes fans don't be alarmed this is still a must have record -grrls never really grow up and there's still a whole lotta riot left in this one."
2,Cheap But Problematic,"I ordered two boxes of 10, why? Because they're cheap. However, I'm going to return one box. Why? Becuse these are the first md's I've used that have given me problems: disc error, non-sync recording. The problems with a particular disk come and go. I haven't had any total failures. Still, no other MD brand I've used has given me problems like these Memorex 80's."
3,Good Product but...,"Good product with a reasonable price but don't hold your breath waiting for them. When they are in stock, it's not too bad but they don't get stock in very often. I have been waiting almost two months for the rest of my order. Product is a 4 maybe 5 star. Delivery ON THIS PRODUCT ONLY (Others have been very good) is a 1 or 2 star."
3,A Bronze For The Golden Age Era Of Hip-Hop,"A poor mans version of The Fresh Prince & DJ Jazzy Jeff, Robbie B & DJ Jazz, was billed as ""Fairly uninspired hip hop."" It borrows a page or two from Brand Nubian and Poor Righteous Teachers, in a lyrically sense, delivering Islamic-oriented messages and a slight gangsta imagery. From the heart of South Philly, the duo fails to perfect an original style; even the repetitive use of sax samples smacks a lack of unoriginal ideas. The Positive K look-a-like DJ Jazz and flat-top sporting Robbie ""Bo"" failed to come correct on their 1990 debut, but it's a must have for fans of the golden age era of Hip-Hop."
3,Old fashioned feel to this book,"This book doesn't quite match its cover - the information is rather dated and needs an overhaul for 2014. Younger readers would find the information less relevant (i.e. little mention of internet use and young adults' social events for example). Parents taking their children to live in Malaysia or individuals going to work there would find aspects of the book helpful though. The tone of the book has an old-fashioned feel but an easy read and I could imagine the writer being a longterm expat or 'old hand'. However there is good advice on hiring staff and local customs. Less so on history, modern business and modern politics."
1,ANOTHER TREE WASTED!,"I have to wonder who wrote this book. It is so awful, certainly no competent adult who even has a fifth grade education could be the author. This book reads like a children's book: See Jane. See Jane Run. Run Jane, Run! That's exactly what any prospective purchaser should do when it comes to the truly awful writing in this book: RUN!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND DEFINITELY DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,Angel Witch - 'Live' (Capitol / Enigma),"If my memory serves me correctly, this was the SECOND disc I ever got. Had to dig it up out of an old stack of other CD's as I haven't heard it in some time. Actually had almost forgotten as to HOW good it really is. 'Live' was recorded from a couple of gigs that took place at the Troubadour in Los Angeles in 1989. The mix is really quite good as the obscure UK metal outfit runs through MOST of the tunes from their classic 1980 self-titled debut, like ""Sweet Danger"", ""Gorgon"", the slower tempo number ""Sorceress"", ""Atlantis"" and others. A couple of the band's singles are included, ""Extermination Day"" and ""Baphomet"". Between songs, one can EASILY notice AW's founder vocalist / guitarist Kevin Heybourne's thick British accent. Overall 'Live' showcases some metal with some tasteful melodies intact. Line-up: Heybourne - guitar & vocals, Grant Dennison - guitar, Peter Gordelier - bass and Spencer Holman - drums. Very cool cover."
2,Bo-ring,"I liked the premise and based on the reviews bought A Hunters Road. Good outdoor writing effectively takes the reader afield in their minds eye, be it the forest of Maine, the flats off the Florida Keys or the African Savannah. Good outdoor writing also speaks to the place that hunting and fishing holds in our life; how it is a part of us emotionally and spiritually. Consequently, good outdoor writing is a tough job, one that A Hunters Road is not up to. For all it's promise this book is a relatively dry travel journal peppered with sappy hunting cliches."
5,"three letters, ""GAW,"" three words, Great American Writer","I have had the distinct pleasure of having read Mr. Fergus's A Hunters Road... At first sight, based on the jacket, I thought it was going to be another ""get drunk, piss in the woods, hook and bullet"" story. However, to my greatest surprise and delight, I found that it was a memorable recollection charming stories about a man, his dog, nature, the environment, and real ""characters"" representing an eclectic vision of America and its people. If Mr. Fergus can survive the unfortunate packaging and placement of his first novel, I am confident that he has the potential to become a Great American Writer..."
4,"Good, with issues","I had DVD's and BluRays coming out of every corner and I couldn't find the one I wanted.I did the research and this seemed like the right purchase.I put it together and realized that it wasn't really going to be stable because the back was made of very thin particle board.I over-glued a thicker skin of masonite from Home Depot (cut to size by the guy there) and it is really solid now.The only complaints are:1) That the main case is about 1/2"" too shallow. The DVD's in the door have to be turned sideways (not the way shown in the picture) to allow the doors to close.2) The drawers don't have any kind of ""stop"" so they come right out too easily.Having said all that, it was a great purchase for the price."
1,Didn't last an hour,"My dog really enjoyed playing fetch and tugging on this. After playing with it for a bit, I left her alone with it for 10-15 mins. In that time, she nearly chewed through the ring. I didn't expect it to last long, but I figured something described as 'virtually indestructible' would be more durable."
3,Good for beginners at decent price.,"I bought this camcorder last year. It was good for taking video, but I don't like the way it keeps still images. The way it works is keeping the same screen for 5 sec, and is recorded on the tape. To transfer to a computer, you need another device, which only save into floopy disk. But overall, it's a good camcorder if you need something cheap and only need to make movies."
1,"Eats Tapes, Doesn't Record","I've had this MiniDV Camcorder for about a year and so far, it has had to be sent back to Canon to be repaired 3 times. Each time, they say they had fixed it and listed the parts that they supposedly replaced, but after a few minutes, the problem returned. This camcorder is very compact, but has low video and photo quality with a small LCD."
1,Has started to eat tapes ...,"Mine too has started to eat tapes. I am not sure what to do with it now. Probably not cost effective to have it repaired and I dont want to risk losing video. Until it started eating tapes, I loved it. As I see others having this problem ... I can't recommend it."
2,"Worked for the 1st year, now eats tapes","I got this camera almost 2 years ago. I was very pleased with its simplicity and quality, which suited my weekend-homemovie-making needs. I have used it in Florida humidity and Nevada dusty desert with no problems. I had taped and watched well over 100 hours of footage, and then began to have occasional problems like a tape being eaten. However, now that my warranty has run out, I am encoutering more frequent problems with loading tapes, both for viewing and recording. I am lucky to have made backups of any improtant video, since some of my source tapes have been damaged beyond repair. Be careful when deciding whether to buy this camera- it can be frustrating."
2,Eats tapes!,"Nice camera with great features, but eats tapes frequently. Has been back for factory repair twice. Not recommended."
4,Dirty Heads,"I've had this product a month and was very pleased with it. We had recorded about 20 minutes of video, part of which my wife had viewed once successfully. We then went to watch the whole tape again, and found that there were thick grey horizontal lines across the picture in playback mode. Based on the manual we used a cleaning tape which resolved the problem although after a further 10 - 15 minutes of viewing the problem re-occurred. A further cleaning again resolved the issue. I don't know if the heads were dirty when we got the camera or if the issue was the brand new TDK tapes we were using. We have bought some Panasonic tapes now which we will use for a week of two before deciding whether there is something more seriously wrong with the camera that needs to be checked out under warranty."
1,TERRIBLE!!! Too bad no 0 stars,"Ditto all the other posts. Worked for about 6mths, then started eating tapes. Repaired twice under warrenty, then warranty ran out, then repaired for $120 and then it happened again. No more good money after bad. Worst electronic purchase of my life. Will never buy Canon again."
2,I can't believe they call this a digital camcorder,"The size is perfect. It's easy to use, once you figure it out. Also the special effects are cool. But when it comes to video quality--what a disappointment and the still pictures are terrible as well. Who wants a camcorder that looks good but doesn't perform well? I returned it not even a week after I bought it. If you want good video quality don't buy this camera."
1,Horrible,I used the camera once and when I tried to use it again it started giving horizontal lines on the recordings and then a CONDENSATION ERROR after that! I need to use it this weekend because my wife is having a baby and it does not work! Canon says I have to send it back to get it repaired. Do not buy this! Save the Hassle.
4,A pleasure,"I own pro digital cameras, but I get an awful lot of use from this little Cannon. Scouting locations, special events, vacations, you name it I've used it. The picture quality is superb, though don't expect the same results as a $10,000 pro cam. It does not work well in low light situations, using the low light setting the camera must be held perfectly still, as in tripod, even then the results are not very good. But that's what camera lights are for. That short comming aside, buy this camera and you will want to take it with you every where you go. It will far exceed your expectations. It's easy to handle, fits snug in the palm of your hand. Well worth the price."
5,BIG bang for the buck... very small camera.,"This is an absolutely amazing little camera... and boy is it little! The only (minor) complaint I have is video quality in low light. Otherwise, this little camera is perfect for everything a normal person needs a camcorder for. I was using it out of the box in a few seconds (the battery came well charged). It is remarkably sturdy, easy to handle, and has a great selection of features. Add that to what I can do with my iMac and iMovie, and I have everything I need, and then some!"
1,Started eating tapes,"We bought this camera in 2002 and now it has started eating and rejecting tapes. At first it would only eat the expensive tapes and worked fine with the cheap ones. Now, it does not work at all. I paid close to 700$ for this and now it is useless.It is obvious that Canon goofed up big time on this one. They should read these reviews and do something about it instead of hiding."
1,Canon ZR10 Appears To Have A Consistent Flaw,"I have owned a ZR10 since June of 2000, and as others have indicated, it definitely has a problem eating up and failing to eject tapes 2 out of 3 times it is used.This problem began after using the camera for only two or three hours.I have been a high school media production teacher for 10 years and have worked with many Canons... GL-1's, XL-1S, ZR-45s, ZR-20...etc. I have never had a problem with any of them in regards to tape ejections issues.No matter how good the bells and whistles are or how good the camcorder records the digital image and sound, it is all moot if the tape is ruined.I agree that Canon owes those of us who bought this camera a free fix or a refund, but I doubt we will ever see it.Don't buy one...new or used."
3,You got trade off for smaller body!,"Watch out this Mini-DV Camcorder's lens! The Maximum CCD resolution only 460,000 pixels. It's only slightly higher than Digital8 camcorder's resolution. Most Mini-DV has CCD 680,000 pixels. Like the Panasonic PV-DV51, for similar price, got 680,000 pixels better lens but bigger body. Both Canon and Panasonic models have pretty good performance rated by Consumer Report.If you don't care the lens resolution, just go for ZR10!Beside that, the optical zoom (the most important part for zoom feature) lens only 10X. PV-DV51 has 18X."
5,Cant sum it up,"This miniDV camcorder I bought is the best piece of video equiptment I own, its so small and light its crazy. And to top it off the image quailty is just plain amazing. I am just an film student and it is perfect for making my movies and doing my small projects with."
3,Comprehensive but not user friendly,"Motivational interviewing is all about understanding your audience and helping them help themselves. It is all about speaking in a compelling way that relates to your listeners. While this book is very good at laying the foundations of ""Motivational interviewing"" in a comprehensive way, it totally misses the mark when it comes to doing what it claims to be teaching. This book is just not friendly. I found it very hard to read through the book and actually learn something practical I could later implement. I would therefore not recommend this book to anyone but true professionals who can deal with an academic style publication. I think it is even better for people with prior background in the field."
5,Motivational Interviewing,"This is a good book to read and keep. The chapters are easy to read because they are not too long. The information is easy to grasp, apply and retain. I definitely recommend this book."
3,Change,This book is a great way to understand how and why people change from diffrent stages in life.
1,Most frustrating book ever!,"I teach at addiction studies at a local university, and found this book to be redundant and frustrating. It repeats itself, as would a student who has a single thought and lots of space to fill. I find this to be the most poorly organized book I have ever taught from, and will not use it again."
2,Boring,"And dry. I'm not even motivated to read it,except it's required for class. I plan to supplement this with a better read that gives more concise examples and doesn't put me to sleep."
5,Good in a litigious society,"This book is a compilation of papers written by over 35 professors outstanding in their field. They all offer different views of MI but basically they are in accord as to its effectiveness. What struck me as being the single greatest aspect of this technique is that there is no way that the patient can misconstrue what you are saying, as you are basically reflecting back the very ideas the patient is using for the patient to examine. In this way, the possibility for lawsuits is greatly minimized. And this is a good technique for the new therapist unsure of themselves.-the author of the book The Vampire Tom Bartek"
2,Boring,Our kids (ages 1 1/2 and 3) never play with this toy. They played with it for a couple of minutes each and haven't picked it up since.
4,"loved the music. Always did, I grew up with this music.","I hope I can get contacted by Amazon over this. I got the disc, and was so excited to play it, and it was cracked when I took it out of the container. I have not gotten to listen to the cd, just play the songs when I can find them on YouTube."
5,Great product for the price,"I got the Sennheiser RS-110 wireless headphones (Remanufactured) and couldn't be happier with the purchase. The sound quality is great, not audiophile, but very good for wireless headphones. I've had them for about 2 months and still haven't had to change the battries but I don't use them all that offten. Can get some signal problems when I have my cellphone near them but that isn't too bad. all in all a great product and well worth the purchase price."
1,Stupid disconnect,"I just got these for my wife so she could hear the TV. But, when the tv is off, the green connect goes off, and stays off even when the tv is turned back on. I have to manually disconnect and reconnect the two audio in rca jacks every time. I am very unhappy and recommend you find another brand."
4,Great For People With Hearing Loss,"Purchased this for my 99 year old mother in law. It works great with no interference unless it is used with an older TV that does not have RCA audio output jacks. What I discovered was when the earphone output of an older TV was connected to the transmitter there was a loud very distinct 60 cycle hum audible which made the earphones useless. However, When I connected the transmitter to the RCA outputs of a Comcast cable box or the audio output jacks of an HDTV this thing worked great!"
5,A very saticfactory purchase,"These headpones exceeded my expectations. The sound is surprisingly clear and far-reaching. The convenience of being able to adjust the volume on my TV to my personal choice without disturbing anyone around me is an indisputable benefit.The haadpnones are somewhat clumsy and could maybe have been designed differently. However, the functioning of the unit easily overrides this discrepancy."
5,Excellent Value,I was shocked just how good a Stevie Wonder concert sounded in these headphones ! Buy Them you can't go wrong!
3,An oldie but a goody,"I got this for a replacement for one just like it a few years old. Love the sound on the phones, and I like the fact that it uses two AAA replaceable batteries. Sometimes you can hear people talking on their cheap home wireless telephones, but it never interferes with operation with the TV sound.For the price, a bargain.Update: The volume control went bad a few months after purchase. Not as robust as my old old previous one.But when It was working, it was outstanding for the price."
2,Product Not good at all,"The Product was not very great. The sound quality is pretty abysmal and the headphones almost don't fit around my ears, they keep faling off. I should have realized this and purchased over the ear ones. In addition you will get static noise every so often, particularly is there's something else nearby also operating at the same frequency. It's also super annoying that you have to tune the knob on the right-hand side in order to get the right frequency that you want. Finally battery life is really horrible. If you leave these headphones on overnight, they'll completely drain your battery. Would not purchase these headphones again, especially at this price."
5,sennheiser headset,works great...deaf in one ear..95% deaf in other..... volume is most important...with this set... i get enough volume to hear tv.....i will be ordering one more set.. for back-up.......thank you sennheiser......for a improving my life...
3,Lack of information,"The headphones need energy provision for the transmitter and I received the box without any electric device. In the box there were only the 2 batteries por the headphones. When I purchased the product, nobody told me I had to buy an additional electric 9 v.c.c provision."
4,Good Design,These headphones work very well and the sound is clear. The instructions are a little less informative than I would like but sufficient.
2,rs-110 headphones,frequent interruptions of static are painful to listen to and reduce my useage of this device.
1,Dissapointed,"I just got my wireless Sennheiser headphones that I ordered as ""NEW"". They came with hair all over the ear pads as well as all over the box. Looked like a dog shed all over it. Never tested it out because I was repulsed."
5,Sennheiser RS-110,"Very Good, I owne two set of the Sennheiser RS-110. One for home and one for work. I use the daily with great results. Also a good price."
5,Sennheiser RS120,"I had ordered what I thought was the wireless rechargerable head set. But I made a mistake and had written a previous review and said that I thought there was something missing and almost imediately after the review was posted a Lady called me from the company and asked what was wrong? After we talked, She found My mistake and offered to take care of my problem, She was such a nice person to work with. The replacement head set came today and it works wonderful. I hope all the people from that company are as nice and helpful as she was. I wish that I could rate her company and the product a few more stars. Ed Payne"
1,headphone #926mhz,these heanphones do not have an on & off putton on the transmiter they use the volumn and this is no good. thanks bob
5,Great Item,This was kind of confusing to set up but after we got it all working it sounds great and I love it.
5,"great item, great price, worthwhile purchase","Purchased set of these after seeing my brother-in-law use them. He has a hearing problem and needs the tv very loud sending others out of the room. For my wife and I it was about watching tv in bed at night when one of us wants to go to sleep and the other wants to finish with a show or late news. Works out perfectly...on-off switch, adjustable volume and tv is totally muted so as not to disturb the other."
4,Decent Wireless Headphones Good Sound especially for casual TV and movie,"Only negative which I can say is the interference which is caused sometimes, have to fine tune the frequency a bit to negate this, Still price considering a A+ item. I use a Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries and they work perfectly good battery life . So if you are ok with charging your own battery no need to get a RS120 model this will do just sound.The headphones are open style(not closed style) giving you clearer for natural sound perfect for dialogue in the movies."
5,Saved the the ears,"Well my hubby can't hear even with hearing aides and this Sennheiser is great, We don't have to blow the neighbors off the walls with the sound he had on 25-30 and me I have excellent hearing.."
1,Transmitter died after 9 months.,"The transmitter died after 9 months.Anyhow, I went for the TV Ears as replacement, mostly because:- You can hear slight hissing and static noise from the RS110 if you listen carefully, or during the quiet scenes. From what I was told, most of the 900Mhz wireless headphones are like that. I decided to try the TV Ears since it's InfraRed based, and doesn't have the hissing/static sound issue. On the other hand, the TV Ears only work if you have line of sight between the headphones and the transmitter.-The RS-110 is pretty bulky - although quite comfortable. It just gets a bit warm after wearing it for a long time. The TV Ears I'm using now is much more lightweight and comfortable. The TV Ears ear buds put just the right amount of pressure and doesn't have the circulation problem like I had with the RS110."
2,Disappointed,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser since the 70s and had several of their open air headphones. These modestly prices wireless headphones are a big disappointment, but I guess you get what you pay for. Lots of hiss when there is no music playing, control unit shuts off and you have to unplug the jack from the stereo to revive it and the instructions TOTALLY SUCK. Other than that, they're OK."
4,"Easy to use, very uncomfortable","It is easy to set up, has pretty nice sound quality, but is very uncomfortable. The headphones are that fabric that the headphones from the early 90s used. Besides that, they are good headphones."
1,This is the worst headphone I ever had,I would not recommend this headphone. It has terrible noise when there is no connection with the transmitter. And it regularly losses connection too.I was so mad that I threw it to garbage can. I will go to buy one with wire.Just don't buy this.
2,yeah no. would not buy again!,"although they were wireless, he did not mention that they had to be plugged into the outlet 24/7 for them to connect to the device. i thought i could have used them for outside wen i am on the go. it took me the longest time to figure out that there was a 3.5 mm jack inside the bigger one. would have been recommended if they were separated from the beginning. It's fine for in the house, the connection is a pain in the ass and they broke within half a year (non excessive use) this was a nightmare and decided to just not bother and trashed the whole thing."
4,Really cool.,"I like to watch TV late at night and my wife always goes to bed before I do. She likes to have the volume almost to nothing so I can never hear it when I wanna stay up and watch. This product allowed me to watch TV and raise the volume as loud as I want. You have to sync the frequency between the phones and the receiver thing, but it only takes a minute, and once you lock it in you don't have to re-adjust. The phones themselves are actually really comfortable. The ONLY negative is that every once in a great while the signal will cut out and you will get a startling, loud static in your ears, so crank the TV volume up and keep the volume on the headphones down."
2,Loved the first set; disappointed in this one,"We ordered the second set of Sennheiser Rs110 926 Mhz Wireless RF Headphones because we had a first set that we LOVE and have given two other sets to friends as gifts--and they love them too. This set however is a disappointment. We don't know for sure the problem, but the transmitter will not tune. We can use the headset in the other room so that two people can listen through headsets, but were unsuccessful in setting it up in the bedroom."
5,"For the price, so much better than the others","The drawbacks are that you have to tune the rf by hand and the batteries aren't rechargable. These amenities would be nice, but it just leads to more stuff that can go wrong. I bought the Sony wireless headphones before these and they would break up whenever I went into the other room and there were certain audio frequencies they couldn't handle. The Sennheiser not only have a better sound quality, but I can leave the house without them breaking up. These can't be beat for the price and are a lot better than more expensive models (Sony, RCA)."
3,Good headphones but too easy to leave them on and clobber batteries,"I did a lot of research before buying these RS110 wireless headphones and I am generally satisfied with them. The audio quality is much better than my old RCA wireless headphones (WHP-150). The range is only slightly better than the RCA headphones (about 50 feet through 3 interior walls).My only complaint with the RS110 is that it is too easy to leave the power on when you are done using them since there is no power indication LED (light). Since this uses AAA batteries, then the batteries will be depleted. I recently started using rechargeable AAA batteries, but I have to take them out to charge them which is less convenient. That seems to be a good workaround if you leave them on accidentally.As always, I was looking to save money but I suggest that you spend a little more money and get the Sennheiser RS120, RS130 or RS140 wireless headphones which have built in chargers. They are all available through Amazon."
3,battery life,Sound is good but battery life is short.Instead of AAA they sould try and make them to use AA. Re chargables are really short life.
5,best Christmas gift ever!,"Been looking for a solution to my need for quiet to go to sleep and my husband's need to watch tv to fall asleep. He uses them every night, and the battery is still going strong. So easy, and my husband says they're comfortable, too."
3,"They work, but it eats batteries","The sound it great, they fit well, easy to hook up and they are comfortable. Everything to get a 5 rating, but the it eats up battery life! If you own a battery store get these, but if plan on using them more than 2 hours a day, look at another option."
2,"Ok, until it broke","Easy to set up, easy to use, sound quality was OK. Not at all comfortable and I would not know about battery life, because it broke 30 minutes into use. At least Amazon was great about my refund."
4,"Good Headphones, only slightly pricey","Good sound quality, but not great. It was a little tempermental with tuning at times, but overall a solid product. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet all my needs, so I had to get another set. However, if you want headphones for listening to music/media, these are a good start."
5,Excellent wireless headphones,"Fantastic headphones. They sound clear and go through walls. If I ever need another pair, I will get the same brand but with the recharger. I'm very pleased."
1,unit DOA and waited wks for the replacement to arrive,"we own 2 of the same model for about 5 yrs. both of them were bought new, no problems so far. took the chance trying to save a couple of bucks, turned into a big mistake for a lot of time spent to exchange emails/phone calls with the seller for a replacement unit...also like the other reviewer mentioned, the unit does not come with a factory box, but a plastic bubble warp."
4,Good Product,The headphones were delivered promptly and in like new condition. Unknown interference from my old receiver caused me to hook it directly to my TV. That worked. The sound is very good. The headphones work several rooms away. In fact the range extends several hundred feet outdoors.
2,Frustrating,"I bought this as a xmas present for my 75 year old dad. He couldn't figure it out, my husband couldn't figure it out, and my 24 year old son couldn't figure it out. How can it be so hard to hook this thing up!"
2,Vicks,I didn't like this product much . This product doesn't have good bass and not conformtable as well.Hence decided to return this product and go for different one.
5,"Far, far away.","Suppose you are listening to something on your computer and you need to get something out of the car. No problem, keep these headphones on and you won't miss a word. Turn out the lights, turn on the TV and you won't even keep the dog awake. Great value for the money. Keep spare batteries in the house, if you use them as much as I do, you'll need them."
5,Great Product,"This is my second one and this does the job. My wife doesn't hear that well and turns up the TV too loud. Now this product makes me happy and I don't always have to say,""Turn the Television down please"". Happier household now. Also prompt service and delivery. Thanks Amazon."
2,RF interference!!!,Tons of RF interference. Recommend not using these unless you are far away from cell phones and WiFi devices.
4,Theatre-quality sound!,"Wow! I bought these for my husband, as I'm sure he's tired of my asking that he turn the TV down so I can sleep at night. Little did I know that I would wish they were for me! The remanufactured Sennheiser RS-110 arrived on time and without a scratch. After fumbling a bit and getting disappointed because I couldn't get it set up correctly at first because there is NO manual included (and the .pdf manual is of no help), I finally got it to work and the sound was simply magnificent. Now my professional-musician-husband is impressed with my purchase and very happy to have his own Sennheiser's."
1,Beware of Re-manufactured Bargains,I recently purchased the Sennheiser RS-110 Wireless Headphones only to find it still needed re-manufacturing when I received it. It seems the power plug in the base unit was malfunctioning and would not power it up. Suggest that you be prepared for such a failure if you purchase this item.The concept of the unit seemed great and I was very disappointed not to be able to experience how the unit might work.
1,The quality control failed on this item,"The sound is great .. the set is very very comfortable, easy to hook up ... the price is right.The problem is after about 10-minutes the sound turns off and gets 'white ' sound which tears off the ears .. pulled off the headset, redic everything even though I had a tcch hook them up.Same thing over and over .. after about 10 minutes, turns off the sound. Wait about 10 minutes and can get the TV sound again .. but it continues over and over.Disappointed in the Quality Control ... the remanufacturing was not successful.Will return them as they are still under warranty . .this happened the first day."
2,Extremely disappointed,"The very first wireless headphones that i own, and what a disappointment it is. sound quality is terrible even if i get VERY close to the transmitter. there would always be an annoying buzz in the background, or worse, echoes. please tell me what i am doing wrong. if this is what people call ""as good as it gets,"" then i would rather just stick with wired headphones instead.the BIGGEST problem i am having right now with it is that it AUTOMATICALLY freaking shuts down whenever my sound volume isn't set high enough to meet its standard. now why the hell does it do that? do the designers want to turn me deaf? i don't know about others, but i for one don't like to turn on my volume too high especially when wearing headphones because it's unhealthy. why not give me the FREAKING power control? is that too much to ask for?i don't care about sound quality at this point, just don't turn off on me in the middle of music/movies. i wish i could get a refund and return this piece of junk."
1,Not a good purchase,This was a used Item. It was not even being close to use this product! I had to send er back to purchase a sony instead.
1,NOT for new technology users!,"unless you have a VHS and other old equipment/ tv, etc, this will not work for you! welcome to the 21st century... we have a 2009 model flat screen LCD, a PS3, a DVD player, and a nice surround sound, and this model will absolutely not work. i don't remember the technical reasons my husband said, but something about there only being an output on our equipment and this thing requiring an input (we even went to radio shack and best buy to look for a converter, and no one carries them... probably because it doesn't make sense to. the converter would mean taking a higher quality sound from your equipment and inputing it into a lower quality equipment [this headphone set]). anyway. useless."
4,great product,- sound quality is excellent- takes a while to properly tune it and get sound perfect but once you have it on right setting it works very well-batteries last a long time-comfortable to wear
3,lound noise when emitter automatic off,"Cannot apply for meditation. Because when pause for around 5 minutes the emitter is off automatically, loud noise start popping up on the head phone until the receiver gets signal, it back to normal.David,"
4,Good for price,"Purchased for wife so she can listen to her music anywhere in the house. Setup was easy but it took a little time to ""tune"" in the headphones. Sound is good but does have momentary static when passing from one room to another. All in all, it was a good purchase and one I'd make again if needed."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I received one unit that worked well, but it cut out every 10-15 minutes. I had to tap the bottom to get it going again (which meant I had to stop exercising each time). I returned it and ordered another, but the second one does the same thing. It is also a bit bulky (adjustment on the headset doesn't get small enough) to wear. I'm pretty bummed. Perhaps the more expensive model remains consistent."
5,Excellent Headset,"These were bought to replace a set of Advent wireless phones that had worn out. These are twice the phones that the others were new. Great comfort, great sound, great distance and really good battery life. You have to charge them before you can use them, but it's no big deal unless you have no patience whatsoever. It took longer to get them out of the package than it did to connect them to my TV. Comes with adapters for several different hookups. Absolutely will buy another of this brand."
4,Good quality remanufactured wireless headphones,"Only one inconvenience with this item. There is a dial on the back of the headphones that has to be tuned to the receiver. It is easy to tune to the right frequency, but just be careful that it doesn't get bumped. So far in over a month, I've only bumped it out of frequency once, so it's not that bad of a problem.Now for the positives. I've never listened to the music full blast because my ears are already bad, but the sound quality is really good to me. I use it at work and the range is better than I expected. I estimate 50 feet easily around corners and through a wall. The fit is comfortable around the ears and I only feel gentle pressure on the head, so it easy to relax with. If the thing ever stops working, I can use the earphones as ear muffs. It is easy to hook up to stereos or computers through ear phone jacks. Adapter is provided for different sizes.Would I recommend? Yes, Especially at the price I got them for (~$26 with shipping included)."
2,Ms R,"Purchased this product from Circuit City. 2 weeks after purchase, the unit started turning off and creating whitenoise in the headphones. These are going back today. I paid way too much for these headphones. I will not purchase this brand again."
2,Yikes! Too much interference!,"These headphones are comfortable, they sound good, but whether it's the 900 Mhz frequency or just poor reception from the headphones, these don't work well where I live. I could not get rid of the interference that would come through in waves, like tuning into a weak station on an old A.M radio. I tried re-tuning, adjusting the transmitter around the room, staying still in a place with the least static, all to no avail. Can't recommend these."
5,Everything you'd expect from Sennheiser,Excellent product. The remanufactured version is as good as new. No visible scratches or blemishes. Sound is clear and crisp. Highly recommended.
1,BROKE WITHIN FIRST THREE MONTHS,"When I first got these, they worked great (bought them in mid August, now it's end of Oct). No issue with the quality as far as I could hear, I used them practically three times a week. However, I just found out in the last week that they broke! The headphones work as far as I can tell, there's still a static sound that comes out of them, but the base doesn't light up when I plug it in, which means I think the base's power is shot for some reason. Of course the amazon return policy doesn't work anymore, so I'm stuck with a large pair of headphones which just breath out static. Great. Does anyone know how to get in touch with the manufacturer? This is clearly a manufacturer's defect."
1,Waste of money - very disappointed!,These headphones work great - for about 15 minutes only! They sound fades and keeps getting lower and lower no matter how high the volume is and how much I try to re-tune the frequency. Eventually I have to take them off because I can't hear the TV at all. A giant waste of money!
3,misleading photo,"We love our Sennheiser wireless headphones and purchased a second pair to use with another TV. However, we were more than disappointed/surprised to open the package to see that it doesn't recharge. The photo clearly shows a base unit with the headphones ""hanging"" above, but I failed to notice there is no wire stand to recharge the headphones. Simply misleading, as it appears to be setup for charging just like our other headphones. We love the sound quality, comfort and ease of use, but don't like replacing batteries. Since these are brand new, I really don't know how to rate the battery life. Overall these are great headphones, but the jury is still out on this battery model."
2,Uncomfortable and bulky,"I thought this might be a low-cost replacement for my current set, but was disappointed with the comfort of the headset. They are foam, but lay heavily on the ears. After 'bout half-an-hour they became warm and uncomfortable. Also, the headphones do not rest on the transmitter, which is inconvenient. I returned them and will look for something else.Also, they use 2 AAA batteries which must be replaced when they run down. I do not know how long this takes, but I assume that the low cost is the reason for this.Not too bad, unless you are used to something better. Don't but his just to save money."
2,I don't recommend this to anyone,"I purchased this mainly because it was on sale. I was in the market for some wireless headphones but didn't want to pay $100+ to but a pair. The sound quality is very poor. I can be right next to the transmitter and have ""fuzzy"" noises go in and out with very poor reception even within 10 feel of the signal transmitter. The headphones aren't very comfortable for my head and sit a little funny as well. One major thing that bugs me about these headphones is the fact that you have to keep tweaking the tuner and it doesn't automatically tune itself. Maybe I was asking too much for a pair of headphones but I honestly can't recommend this pair of headphones to anyone. It would be worth it to purchase a more expensive pair of headphones than to deal with the hassels of this item."
1,Very Dissapointed,"The truth is that I thought I had made ''a good buy but I was disappointed when I started using it, my tv is 8 feet away and the signal is interrupted for 2 minutes each time, 2 minutes you hear very well and the signal drops for 2 minutes and even more, so it was like throwing the money in the garbage"
4,Really good,"As has been mentioned before this are pretty good, don't like that they are flat. I use them for videogamos at night so I don't wake up the family. For this they work great.Got them as Gold Box deal of the day.Would buy again."
2,Very annoying to use in practice,"The sound quality on these headphones is fine, but they have some issues which make them incredibly annoying to actually use.First, no matter how well you adjust the tuning, you can never completely eliminate the background fuzz.Second, the transmitter part that plugs into the computer often takes several seconds to notice that sound is coming out and it needs to turn on and start transmitting.Three, if you leave them on your head after, say, watching a youtube video or something, after about 30 seconds or so, the transmitter will automatically turn off and suddenly your ears will get blasted with fuzz.Other than that, they are great."
4,great headphones,have had these for almost 3 yrs my kids bought them for me and they are great never have had on problem the range on them is amazing my wife was able to go almost a half a block before it started to fade
5,sh earphones,"The earphones perform as advertised - excellent in all respects. Sound is superb, audio separation is excellent, and convenience is a plus. I recommend this product to anyone for TV or music listening."
1,A prototype?,"I was extremely disappointed with these headphones. The sound quality is horrible, and the material and the craftsmanship is very poor. I felt the loud static would damage my ears. It drops signal frequently and the transmitter gets switched off frequently at a low volume. It would be waste of time and money if you order it. Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I returned this item. The headphone will go into my trash if I ever get it for free ."
2,"Good, while it lasted...","The headphones worked as expected, decent sound and I had no trouble with interference or hissing. I noticed that the transmitter seemed to get pretty warm so I would unplug it when I was done using the headphones. After about two months of occasional use the transmitter no longer powers on at all."
4,Good Product,These headphones have greatly increased my television viewing pleasure and domestic harmony. As my hearing has been declining over the years the television volume has been increasing much to the dismay of everyone in my neighborhood. These headphones have enhanced the clarity of the audio so much that I find myself waiting anxiously to see movies whose audio was so garbled that I stopped watching them before (the Lord of the Rings trilogy for one).The headphones could be tighter. They tend to fall off easily as another reviewer stated. For some reason my transmitter was sent with an angled power jack even though the direction sheet shows a straight jack. In the tight space used to plug in power the angled jack doesn't fit well.
5,I own two,I know own two of these and they are a great product for a small investment. The fact that they use RF and not IR allows me to use them even when I am in another room. I dont miss a second of voice. I am hard of hearing and this allows me to hear all the dialogue. I highly recommend it.
1,Oh boy. . .,"You get what you pay for. Cheap headphones, poor sound quality that you cannot tune in just right, so you get lots of hiss and interference. If you are watching a movie or playing a video game, and you pause for too long, the headphones blast your eardrums out with white noise which will make you sweat and grind your teeth with stress. Spend a few bucks more and get something of higher quality. These aren't even worth the plastic they are made with."
4,Great Headphones,"Very good headphone, for a good price. Had this a for a few weeks now, and I use it every night. The Highs are clear and base is crisp. Very comfortable to wear. The reception needs to be adjusted once in a while, but three million electronic devices in my room may have something to to with that.Only one con:No battery charger in base. I just use a couple of rechargeble batteries. AAA.Great h"
4,Very Good for the price,"I was a little hesitant to buy some remanufactured headphones but I figured why not try them since they were so cheap. I have to admit they are better than I expected. They fit pretty comfortably, they work great and the batteries last a pretty long time. I use them at work only for about 5 hours a day on average and they will run for about 2 weeks before I need to change the batteries, and its only 2 AAA batteries. There was no instructions which was a little annoying but they were easy to figure out. The antennae unit is pretty small and it had a very small scratch, but nothing to complain about. My only issue with them is that the headphones are a little large, but they're not that heavy so it's not too bad. Overall a great deal on some good headphones."
1,Would never touch this brand again,"The headphones don't fit well, hot and uncomfortable, poor instructions in several languages, I still don't believe they are stereo, static and very touchy. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I don't know how they are getting such good reviews. I gave them a fair shot. Taking them back and probably trading for Creative."
3,Didn't get to try them--not enough audio inputs on our TV.,Had to return item and seller issued a store credit. My old Sennheisers hooked up to old TV are great.
3,Sennheiser RS 110,"i'M STILL CHECKING IT OUT. aT ONE LOCATION COULD NOT GET THE HEADSET SOUND UP LOUD ENOUGH / LONG ENOUGH. BUT i HAVEN'T GIVEN UP. AT THE CURRENT LOCATION IT APPEARS TO BE PROVIDING SOUND OK, BUT I WILL BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT IN ABOUT A MONTH.Paul Thornquist"
2,Broke quickly,"Not a fan of these headphones, I heard they typically are a good brand, but mine lost the channel quickly and I had a bad experience with them."
2,They work,"If you don't care about what your listening to sounds like, then this is the perfect product for you. On the other hand, if you like good sound and expect that current wireless technologies could deliver decent quality, then look away. Sennheiser is a great brand. I have a pair of HD 280 Pros that easily compete with headphones 5x their price (don't just take my word for it). However, Sennheiser has completely failed this time. Horrible quality (I'm only 8 feet away) plus the static is TREMENDOUS. Unacceptable."
3,Mostly good but with flaws. Purchased at Amazon in 2011.,"Sound is bright and highly enjoyable. They are very comfortable to wear. My very sensitive to the touch ears tolerate them better than any others I've worn. Two stand-out problems resulted in the downgrade. First, they have a nasty reoccuring ""bzzt"" that cannot be adjusted away. It does this about once every 30 seconds to a minute; it doesn't matter where you are relative to the transmitter. Second, the battery life quotes are dreaming. I might get 6 hours of use before I have to change batteries. I might buy a used pair if the price was right (under $20), otherwise, I'd look elsewhere. (Used since 2011)."
3,"Good sound, good price, poor design (hurts top of head)","I recently downgraded from the RS160 to the RS110 as I didn't like the ""muted"" sound of the RS160, certainly a combination of their being ""closed back"" and of the ""kleer"" technology. The RS110 are ""open-back"" and use good old RF transmission. Sound is much better, unfortunately they quickly get painful to wear unlike the RS160.They are light enough however the earpads are completely flat so the RS110 rests entirely on the top of your head and while there is ""cushy"" material on the band it quickly becomes painful. The RS160 had some real ""around the ear"" earpads so there was some support there. The RS130 earcups appear to be of a similar size so I might try to fit on the RS130 earpads that Sennheiser sells for $10..."
2,Disappointing.,"As these do not recharge on the cradle, they run on batteries, the batteries ran out after a couple of hours, we put new ones in and they lasted a few hours. I returned them and got the senheiser rechargeable headphones."
1,disappointed -- had to return product,"Disappointed in product due to static, random sharp noises and lack of music privacy -- others can hear your music even if volume isn't loud. Save yourself the return fee and go with another headset."
3,"Nice, but could be better","Ok, let me get this out of the way; The auto-off feature is extremely annoying. What is it? It turns the transmitter ( NOT the headphones) off after a short amount of time. The problem is, it has to actually pick up enough noise before it starts transmitting again. It just doesn't work as well as an on/off switch.The lack of auto-off on the headphones is almost as bad. It's my own fault, but I left them on multiple times overnight and the battery was completely drained.Other than that, they're okay. The quality is nice for RF and they're pretty comfortable as long as you adjust them right. On a side note: one time I picked up my neighbors phone conversation. Pretty weird... but whatever."
3,bought for dad,listening quality isn't the greatest and earphones aren't comfortable. needless to say that i didn't win best gift award that year
5,Works Great!!!,"Clear crisp sounds. Lightweight and comfortable. Exceeded expectations. Full time in a nice Class A Motor Home. She can play her music from the computer or watch TV and does not disturb me while I play my guitar and I am not disturbing her. Even going out side and enjoying music in the evening. Some reviews said something about cracking noise, but it works perfect for us. Yes, I would recommend this headset and it was also a good price. From a happy old retired guy roaming around the country!!!!!"
1,Noisy and unreliable,"I have the base unit not more than 6 feet away from me and despite all the tuning, even turning my head brings in static/interference that sounds like when you have a defective small radio or very short antenna. Sound quality isn't too bad but what's the point when the headset induces additional piercing noise in the audio. A bluetooth set may bit a more but it is definitely leagues better than this junk."
4,my headphones slip off my head when I bend.,When I bend they fall off my head. Any idea how to fix it? otherwise sensational- they let me work in the kitchen or in the garden listening to my favorite programs.
4,sound,"Headset works great for watching tv. They have great sound quality. I have three Sennheiser headsets, one for the computer and the other two for different tv's."
5,I love these head phones. I use them in the evening when my husband doesn't want to hear the T.V. The controls are great!,I love my head phones. I use them when my husband doesn't want to hear the television later at night. Everything sounds very clear and sharp and I like the controls on the sides of the earphones!
2,Not thrilled,"I don't like how these feel on. The ear cups are not cupped. They are very loose and definately don't block out any external noise. It's like they just rest on the side of your head, and can easily move off the ear. I wanted wireless, but in this price range the quality just wasn't there so I went back to Turtle Beach wired headset X12 (they are marketed for Xbox but I use them just to watch TV). In this price range I couldn't find wireless headsets that compared to the sound I get out of the X12s."
2,Not Suitable for Music Listening,"Like others, I was somewhat bothered by background hiss, although it was barely audible. Even more annoying was the poor sound quality of the headphones themselves. The bass was muddy, even fuzzy. Mid range was acceptable, but sometimes was accompanied by buzzing, and the treble was thin and weak. And as for ""sound stage"", there was none. Stereo imaging was nonexistent despite noticeable left to right separation. The Sennheiser RS110s would probably be OK for television or talk radio, but few would want to listen to music with them. I was forced to return them due to the sonic defects."
3,COULD BE BETTER,"Every photo I have seen gives the impression that the headset is resting on the transmitter, as though that was a place to store them. Such is not the case and is only a minor thing. The headset, however, is the most uncomfortable I have ever worn. The main part, that fits over your head, is nonadjustable, hard, solid plastic, with little or no flexibility, so the adjusters, right above the earphones, are too far down to allow for a tight or comfortable fit. Lean forward and the headset tends to slip right off. I have an ""average-sized"" head, so I should be able to find a comfortable fit, but such is not the case. I have other Sennheiser headsets and they are comfortable to wear. Living in a small house, I have no problems with reception, but the headphone fit keeps this product from being what one would expect from Sennheiser."
2,Not Very Good,"I bought these cordless headphones to replace my broken Radio Shack one's and to be honest with everyone, the sound is GREAT ..... when the batteries are fully charged. But the sound comes and goes and is constantly has a knocking sound. The first week or two they worked great, but since the batteries died and I recharged them the headphones have not worked as well.In all fairness to the heaphones, maybe I need to get some NEW rechargeable batteries.I one thing I DO LIKE it they have a control to adjust the reception received on them, which is a nice feature. OVERALL, I DO like the sound quality, I just have to see if it a battery issue I am currently having. For $39.99 and FREE S/H I would buy another set ( if the battery issue is resolved )."
4,Sennheiser wireless headphones,"I read the ratings and it helped me make an informed decision. The set up took a little while to figure out and optimize, but they work great once you check everything. My advise if you have one TV and need to keep the volume down, buy these. Make sure to try out different locations for the receiver base to get the best reception. Also base needs to be away from electrical outlets and other wireless devices. The controls are very good as is the fit."
5,Super headphones,These work great.....now I can hear the TV w/o the rest of the family being blasted out. Even with the volume of the TV speakers set on low...I can adjust my headphones to hear clearly.
5,Great product,Good set of head phones. I use them for tv only and I love them. I walk around the house and out to the garage and still get great sound. Just what I wanted.
1,Great product . . . in 1979!,"These wireless headphones are darn near the ""junk"" cateogry. They do work a little bit but not very well. Would have been great 30 years ago. These are possibly defective. The box looked great. The instructions were fine. The power supply plug was a bit difficult to insert and difficult to manipulate. I could tune in 1 channel just fine, but it it was impossible to get enough amplitude when I tuned in both ears. I will try a different brand next time.Luckily it's easy to return items to Amazon."
3,Bargin price but annoying issues,"Like others, I bought this for wireless listening soI can play guitar or watch TV whilist the house is sleeping.Sound wise ... they are Ok .. and reception isgood ( at least in the 20x 30 room I use them in).1. Issue 1: Batteries are Ok .. but there is noindication ( LED ) that the unit is on whichmeans that you will likely take them off withoutflipping the power switch.2. Whilist they are ok for sitting and watching TV,they tend to fall off my head ( I'm a full grown man 45yrwith a ?normal? head .. too often when I wander aroundand look down.3. Issue 3: Da' Fricking fine tuning knob is on same ear as thevolume .. and that tends to cause you to rotate thewrong one 50% of the time ! .. stupid damn layout.I also have a pair of Sony wireless from Rat Shack .. andthey have their own problems too.[...]"
1,"Horrible, so bad I sent them immediately back","I have used a couple other wireless Sennheiser models, these were the worst ever! I wouldn't expect them to perform as well as my $200 set, but I have used another cheaper model and it was still way better than these. The sound I got was so garbled and full of static that it was indecipherable. Whether I had some other wireless device causing the problem I don't know, what I do know is these were unusable. I sent them back and got a wired set instead, and just use a really long extension cord. Not quite the freedom of wireless but works well enough, without all the static."
4,These headsets saved our marriage,"For years, these headsets have made it possible for me to watch my favorite shows at any hour of the day or night without bothering my adoring, but sensitive wife. She can sleep in an adjoining room, do housework, or read right next to me on the couch without being bombarded by tv noises. Conversely, if I am involved in a quiet activity, like reading, I am spared a ""HGTV headache"" when she wears them. I can get audio reception anywhere in the house and the sound is excellent. I have recommended the Sennheiser RS110 to several friends and they have been happy with them. My wife tells folks that these headsets have saved our marriage.There were some minor problems with the initial set-up, especially if you are not technically inclined. They were very easily resolved and the result has been well worth it."
5,The best wireless headphones I've ever used,"I've owned a couple of different types of wireless headphones and listened to a couple of other brands owned by other people. Every other one I have ever tried has had some static noise, especially when you move around the room with them. I had returned a pair of the infrared headphones after being completely disgusted with the high-pitched noise generated by the computer, etc... I had pretty much given up on wireless, that is until now. These are utterly quiet and the sound quality is outstanding. I am completely satisfied with them. I recommend them without any hesitation or reservations. I won't even look at another brand now."
1,Terrible - too many design flaws,"Where should I start? To many design flaws.1- Not suitable for office use since people around you can be disturbed. Yes, loud.2- The jack plugging into the audio port is too big, so I don't expect it to last. Very likely the cleaning person (or you) will hit it by accident and bend it. It happened to my co-worker sitting next to me, so it's not rare at all.3- MAJOR FLAW - the FM transmitter turns itself off if it detects that there's no music playing for 10min or so. After that, if the music is back on, it's not automatically on, and I had to unplug and re-plug the audio jack from my computer computer to turn it back on (!!!!). Even when the music is on for 30min, the FM transmitter malfunctions and turns itself off; as a result, all you hear in the headset is static, and the static is extremely loud like a radio that you can hear it from 200ft away (!!!!)"
3,NOT RECHARGEABLE,"These headphones are NOT rechargeable, despite the misleading picture which makes them look exactly like the rechargeable model from the same company. The box and literature inside has very little written instruction in English and I had gotten all the way through destroying the box and packaging and taken the headphones to the TV before I realized there was nothing to set the headphones ON.On the other hand, I am very hard on my headphones and use them every day and have managed to get hair color and other stuff inside the battery compartment and destroyed them, so maybe buying a cheaper version and replacing the batteries is better. But where to hang the stupid headphones? Another piece of clutter in the bedroom.I really wish the website description would have been more clear and the packaging as well. I think it is purposely deceptive towards those who aren't reading very carefully and are familiar with the brand. The photo looks just like the recharging type."
3,Range of 330 ft. my butt!,"For $40, these headphones are well worth it. However, they reach nowhere near the 330 ft. that they claim it will reach. I use them in my dorm room primarily to plug in to my laptop while I lie in bed and relax, but if I try to walk even 150 ft. down the hall to go to the bathroom I receive terrible static which makes it unbearable to listen to them. If I just stay in my room they are great, but as soon as I go out the door I start to receive interference. On top of that they start to become uncomfortable after extended use. If I wear them for more than 30 min. they start to hurt my ears and I have to take them off.I'm kind off disappointed with the range and comfort, but they work fine for what I need them to."
2,Can't get it goin!,"The set up is supposed to be easy, but with our elaborate receiver I have yet to get this product going. I have no idea where to plug it in since our sound does not come from the t.v. but from speakers. Hopefully I'll figure it out another time when I have more patience. Seems comfortable though I can't quite rate it properly just yet."
1,Wireless Headphones,This item was shipped to me with no packing slip. There was no instructions on how to connect it. I tried it but I could not make it work. I don't think I will ever buy anything from this company again.
3,Not Bad,"Sound quality is OK. You have to balance between headphone volume, volume on your pc and volume on mp3 player.Could be better keeping other sounds out.Comfortable, I where them for extended periods at work.The only negative comment I have is that It could be better handling startling static through headphones when the base station cuts off. Really no excuse for that."
4,They Do The Job,Since there are already so many reviews I won't elaborate on mine.I mainly use them in my upstairs TV room where I already have surround sound installed. So I lose all of that great sound quality BUT I don't have to hear my wife telling me to turn the volume down after she goes to bed and I watch/listen to a movie.My initial set of alakine batteries lasted about a month but I now have rechargeable ones installed. That will help on costs.Pros for me: They still give me stero effect and are clear enough for me to hear the softer parts of conversations which helps with my somewhat dimished hearing.Cons you have already read: Headphones are bulky and instructions are brief to say the least. Low battery indicator would be nice.Like I said the price was right (around $55 with free shipping) and they truly do the job.
4,wireless headphones,"A solid purchase. Although the ear cups could stand a little more padding, the sound is very good...even up to 30 ft from the base."
2,Not what I expected. Bluetooth or wired headset recommended..,"If you tune the headphones properly the sound is mediocre (average) and thats not always the result. It's easy to use as long if you set it up properly. Put the batteries in the headphones then attach the ""station"" plug into a power source then to whatever has a port for headphones. After that you should be fine. When I brought it I thought I'll be able to walk with both my iTouch and the headphone. Not so. If I wanted to listen to music I'll have to connect my iTouch to the ""station"" and listen to it like that (without being able to walk). I decided to connect it all to my iMac because I wouldn't have to leave while on the computer. It worked the first time, but afterward I think I was tuned into some Police conversation. I would recommend getting a bluetooth headphone or just a wired one instead."
2,Stopped working in couple of months,"I hardly used this product. But, when I did, it stopped working. The base unit will not power up. Frustrating."
5,Good sound,"Very high quality and good sound,was impressed with ease of use.Their set up so you can lay down with comfort and the head set doesn't get in the way. I am impressed,all in all a very good product for a good price.Sam Michigan."
2,Low hum and clicking noises make for bad deal for me,"I've had other Sennheiser products in the past and been pleased with them, but not these headphones. I bought them as a gift for my father in law and went to set them up yesterday. I was generally disappointed by the power supply (a couple of AAA batteries with a life of what, maybe 15-20 hours), but very disappointed by the sound quality. Low humming noise was easily heard anytime the program volume dropped and that was accompanied by an intermittent clicking sound. Tried all three transmitting channels to see if I could get around those problems, but no luck, so back these go!"
3,Wish it had a cradle and rechargeable batteries,"Great headphones in terms of sound, comfort and range, but will probably buy the 120s in the future. This headphone does not have a cradle on the base to store headset. And it does not come with nor have the option of charging rechargable headset batteries. The extra $20 for the upgrade is more than worth it."
4,Good quality with new batteries,"Sennheiser quality headphones. The only problem is the battery life and the functional range especially through doors and walls. It is also an open can so keep that in mind. Otherwise, a great pair of quality headphones with a reasonable price."
5,Sennheiser RS110 926 Mhz Wireless Rf Headphones,I would have gotten another pair of SONY Wireless if they were available. I'm glad that they weren't as the Sennheiser Wireless are far superior.
2,So so,"Not worth the money. The signal is really weak!! Sound quality not so good, don't waste your money."
4,"Pretty good headset, gets the job done","Headset is a little big, but pretty comfortable. Works great (we have it in our bedroom, so the signal is going only about 10 ft, but sounds awesome). The only complaints are:Headset is bigThere is a faint hummimg noice (barely noticeable) when listening to the tv. Not sure if it's the headset or the channel or the tv, but if you listen for it, you will notice it.I would rate this item A-"
1,It doesnt work,"I just bought this stuff and Im really dissapointed because I connected it to my stereo which is conected to my PS3 but it works really bad, actually the sound is really poor and the signal has a lot of interference I tuned in all frecuencies but it only get worse."
3,"Good sound, but not clean","I got mine remanufactured, and it is so hairly. Big job cleaning up the whoever it was so hairly ears..."
4,satisfied,"product is OK 90% of the time...however there are interruptions with piercing static which can be very startling and ear popping. otherwise, works just fine."
4,mixed review,"I have two Phillips tv's, A 36 inch and a 55 inch. The headphones work great with the 36 inch but for some reason will not work with the 50 inch, sounds like interference. Have not been able to find the cause yet."
1,Mismatched Hook Ups,The input hole on the Sennheiser RS110 is not large enough to accomodate the cord that must plug into it. The Wireless Headphones light up to show that they are getting the battery power to receive the signal but no way to get the electric power cord to plug in. Very disappointed.
2,don't like it,they were for my husband and he said it's like watching a boot leg movie the words that u hear don't match up with the lips on the tv
2,not good,"they are not as great as you think, you have to put it batteries and also connect the cable, it is not what i expected, it only for home"
4,Love my headphones. I recommend this product for everyone.,". Easy to hook up. Great sound. I would recommend these to anyone. I had no zone headphones before , what a nightmare."
4,Good Headphones For a Great Price!,"I bought these headphones for my husband, and he uses them all the time. He said there is a little static in the background and the sound quality is overall good, but not perfect. Also, he didn't use it far away from the transmitter, so we don't know how the headphones work if you are further away. Anyway, we both agree that it is a very good product for the price."
1,headphones,These head phones where given as a Christmas gift and they work now and then and disapointed that I have to pay the shipping to return them. That's what I get for shopping too early!
5,"It's all been said, but good headphones!","I really liked the price on these headphones, and they do just what they say they do. They ship with everything you need for whatever audio hookup you need: component, 3.5mm, 1/4"".The sound quality is generally good. The range is great: throughout my house. They are often staticy, but can be fine-tuned for ideal reception. They do go to a very loud static if they don't receive input for about 5 minutes straight and you haven't turned them off. Freaked me out when I went to bed and then noticed this soft hiss from I-couldn't-tell-where.All in all, how can you beat $50 for a set of cordless Sennheiser phones? Keep that in mind, and you'll be very happy with these."
2,Ok if you only want static,"I bought to help 95 yr old Dad hear TV and thought wireless would be great. Followed all instructions and tried on more than one TV(ranging in age of 2 mths-3 yrs old). Static is all we can get. Very disappointed,and sorry that after trying everything several times, I have to return. We will have to pay for return, etc.,but time for that and time spent on them already is just wasted. They may not be the most expensive-but far from the cheapest!"
1,Junk,I installed the unit and noticed the power light on the base turns off. I never got the headphones to work. I repackaged it and sent it back. Pure junk.
4,works great,"I had a pair of headphones that were about 5 yrs old and faded out much too often. After using the Sennheiser RS110 for about a month or so, I've never had a problem with fading. I did have a problem with the headphones slipping off my head. I added a few extra pieces of thick foam rubber and that seems to help. Of course, now it looks extra goofy, but I only wear them inside the house, so I don't care. Shipping was unbelievable. I ordered mid-day and had it in my hands 27 hrs later with amazon prime."
3,Priced good,"The product is remarkably good among it's rivals, due to price and quality. But I got this re manufactured unit, although on Amazon it was labeled as new. So Friends be careful of these things."
2,Really Disappointed,"I was looking forward to getting these after reading the reviews. First of all, they are huge. I'm a girl and they made me look like I was wearing an alien device on my head. They would fit a guy better but if you are female, be aware they are LARGE. Second, there isn't a hanging rack for them. It's a bummer since I had a tower unit previously that I could just hang the headphones on and that kept them together nice and neat. Lastly I like to listen to the music pretty low. I wear them at work and I want to hear the music but not be bombarded by it. You turn on the headphones but the base has an auto on/auto off function. Apparently with the volume turned down, it doesn't think it is in use and will literally cut itself (and you) off a minute or so into a song. Sigh.... All in all, they were really disappointing."
1,Stay away,This was the worst piece of electronics I have ever seen.Remanufactured garbage it is not as represeneted. They said it was originally 99.00. I have seen far superior products by sony and even radio shack for 50.00. Shipped in a cheap plastic bag with no instructions. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Mine didnt even work! Reminded me of the cheap $1.99 plastic toys I buy my three year old.
2,do not waste your time,The earpiece is very uncomfortable. The product did not come with any instructions so it was difficult for me to set it up. I returned the product.
2,A lesson learned --- TWICE,"Update: I had given our first set five stars, they worked beautifully until the recharger base stopped working. Decided to buy another set - it's less than 6 months old and this base has stopped working too! We won't waste money a third time!!!"
2,"These look like good headphones, but...","The ones I ordered did not come with any sort of box, and no owner's manual either. Since there were a Christmas gift, and I did not open the box to wrap them until after Thanksgiving, I am too late to return them. I will be more careful if I ever order anything remanufactured again."
2,Defective product,"The headphones I received only worked on the right side. No sound came out of the left side. It was hard for me to evaluate the sound quality with only one side working. I returned the headphones after trying them with various audio devices and still getting the same result.Aside from the obvious defect, I found the headphones too tight on my ears. Also, at this size, I would expect a cup design that fits around the ears rather than pressing against the ears."
4,Nice quality!!,These are my first wireless headphones & they came recommended to me by a coworker. I haven't been disappointed yet. They are easy to set up & adjust to and super comfortable. I love being able to tune them sound wise & the batteries last quite a long time with them. I am impressed & will buy this brand again in the future.
4,Good value,"These headphones are great for a larger or wide head. There's no real head adjustment, so expect slippage if head is smaller. Walked almost a block away from the base without retuning or changing volume. Running water seems to create brief interference. Ear pieces comfortable for long periods."
4,Good product,"The Headphones have been great, since they were a remanufacture they didnt come with any directions. That said they are headphones and somewhat self explanitory. The sound is great and the range is good. I can now whatch the news in the morning without hearing any complaints from My girlfriend about the loud TV"
2,Sennheiser RS-110 Wirless Headphones,The battery's do not last very long.I find the head set uncomfortable.
2,cheap headphones for a cheap price,"These headphones have helped me figure out what I want in a pair of wireless headphones. The headset is very bulky and fits very loose and slips, I have to wear a hat to keep it from sliding off. Pads don't wear very well and aren't comfortable and anyone within 10 feet or so can hear what you are listening too. Definitely not worthy of comparing to BOSE headphones! Reciever is a little big. Distance from reciever with one wall in between seems to be about 100'. Sounds quality is ok till the batteries start to fade. then you get highs and lows and some static. I will be replacing them soon with an alternate brand. not impressed, but they are cheap so what can you expect...."
3,serves a purpose,This item works as described. It breaks up a little on movement and sound quality is not the best in the world compared to my HD 595's but they do serve a purpose and allow you to listen to whatever wirelessly. If you need to listen to something why you move around/outside the house this serves that purpose. If you want hear HiFi audio go wired and the HD 595's are incredible.
2,ear muffs too tight,"although the sound is very good and the setup simple, the ear muffs apply much too much pressure on the ear itself. The headphones were uncomfortable from the moment I put them on. You can imagine how they felt after wearing them for a one hour program. Adjusting the scalp extension did not help.I'm ready to return them"
2,OK when they work,"I was so excited to get these, and they did work pretty well when all the conditions were right - pretty close to the base without too many obstructions. But first of all, you cannot use them if someone else in the house is watching TV without cable, because it picks up the antenna signal even if it is not plugged into the TV! Secondly, they simply stop working for no reason. You'll be listening along, and all of a sudden you'll just get noise, and the base ""on"" light will go off. It's plugged in, the outlet is working fine, but the base just stops transmitting. This may be just a badly refurbished product, but I'm sending it back, and its replacement won't be a Sennheiser."
3,First wireless headphones,I'm semi-happy with these headphones. There is a little distortion at mid to high levels of volume this could be due to my old sb live card which i'm replacing with an audigy 2 (already ordered).
1,Not Impressed.,I had nothing but trouble with these headphones. The sound quality was very poor. All I could get was static no matter what I used them with or where I used them!Mike
3,Worked but a few cons,"It worked well with my computer and could go to any part of my apartment and listen to music. However, you do have to tune it on both the earphones and the attachment that comes with it."
4,Still Workin...,"Pretty good range but doesnt like walls TOO much. A little fuzziness through a partition (i.e. a drywall wall) but great quality in the same room. Good battery life and easy to set-up. Dont expect the same quality as corded but at least it wont keep your wife up (just try not to laugh when you watch TV...besides waking her up, you look like an idiot when nobody knows what youre laughing at). Havent broken em yet but dont let your kids play with them. All in all, no regrets...I never shopped for another pair after I got these."
2,INSTRUCTIONS SUCK,"I couldn't tell you how well this product worked because I am still in the process of figuring out how to use it! The instructions are brief, short, not very detailed, and leave a lot out. Gurl, give me some help here!"
2,Didn't work as advertised.,"I bought these to use in our bedroom so I could watch TV without disturbing my wife. When I installed them, the volume of the TV had to be up to hear over the headphones. The description said you could use the headphones so you wouldn't disturb others so I assumed they would work for me. I have returned them."
4,Headphone review,"I'm giving these four stars just because I haven't had any headphones that actually lasted for any period of time. That said, I use mine when I'm on my treadmill hoofing it, so they get plenty of bouncing. These are comfortable to wear, block out some of the noise of the treadmill and I can hear movies or workout videos playing on my computer even 25 feet away in the kitchen. they may work for greater distances, but that is all I've tested so far. I've had these about 6 months and use them 4-5 times a week for a couple of hours per use and they are still working. they don't require you keep any internal bands compressed to get a signal - they only have to be on your head. The band is comfortable but sturdy enough they seldom fall off unless I'm really snapping my head around. The amplifier is sufficient for me to get significant volume and the tuning wheel has come in handy a couple of times when the signal shifted."
2,Good Sound - Little Comfort,"These have good sound, but comfort and fit are just not there. The ear pieces are flat, very little cushion, and don't swivel enough to fit to your head very well."
4,"good Headphones, but without built-in charger","These headphones work well and the sound quality is very good, too. The only problem is that they don't have a built-in charger for batteries."
4,Wireless Headphones,"The wireless headphones have worked as I had expected, covering a range of at least 50 ft out of doors and on a different (higher) floor and held excellent reception. The rechargeable batteries last longer than expected. external sounds do pass through rather easily,but they are not designed to muffle such sounds nor do they include noise cancelling circuitry. I am very satisfied with them."
4,Great product at a great price,"I have been looking for an inexpensive set of wireless headphones so I can watch football on the big screen without disturbing the family. Got these for Christmas and they work great. The batteries last for a long time and the wireless signal is great. My only complaint is they start to get a little uncomfortable (on my ears) after several hours of use - maybe I need to get use to the positioning on my head. If you are looking for a low cost/high quality set of wireless headphones, then I strongly suggest you get these."
3,good......except,"After about a month of use, this remote headphone is ok, but.....The transmitter and receiver use the same RF band as legecy cordless analog phones. I tried all three channel settings but will still get interference from cordless phones from other houses in area. Some several hundred feet away. I have picked up full conversations on this head phone, so much for privacy.I use this headphone for my 22"" flat panel. Sound is ok, but comfort is not good for long periods of time. Controls take a little time getting use to, a minor complaint. Transmitter auto off is nice when TV is turned off (thats when picking up phone calls happens).Was going to return item. but I only use occasionally."
5,Great gift for dad and helps everyone else in the room!,"My mom got these for dad for Christmas because the TV was always turned up way too loud for the rest of us. NOW, he can watch TV anytime and we can sit in the room with no volume for us so that we can read or just chat, if we want! Was a little tricky figuring out where we needed to plug them into our TV and how to get sound for everyone else, but once we got it, we were good to go. I highly recommend these. We did figure out that the volume on the TV has to be turned up loud enough for the transmitter to pick up the sound all the time, or it will randomly shut off, but once we figured that out, all's well that ends well."
3,Ssssssss...The sound of Sennheiser,"Not impressed with these. At. All. It's a shame, too: this is the first Sennheiser product that has disappointed me. But they are a bit bulky, awkward, and the hiss. Oh my goodness, the hiss! Very, very pronounced. Tried adjusting the volume on the TV and headset repeatedly, to no avail. Kinda wishing I'd returned them within the 30 day period."
4,Pretty Cool,"These headphones have a pretty solid range and the qualities as expected for the price, nothing outstanding but good. They lay on your ears and if playing loud music can be heard by others around you. After a while of wearing them they start to squish your ears and hurt. All and all they are pretty cool and i would recommend them."
4,Wireless Headphone,Sennheiser RS110 Over-Ear 926MHz Wireless RF HeadphonesAs I get older my high frequency hearing falls off. These headphones appear to boost the high frequencies which allow me to keep the volume from the TV at a reasonable level. It uses an RF transmitter rather than infrared so I can move around the room without losing the signal. It uses regular batteries so I don't have to keep it on a charger and the battery life is very good. The only negative is the ear cushions are foam instead of plastic or leather so they are not as comfortable. And I may not be able to replace them when they wear out.
3,Headphones are ok,"This product is very large, with no way to make smaller. The thing falls off my head every time I move."
2,RECONDITIONED ??,"The left headphone has never worked. I realize that I puchased a reconditioned product but I thought that it would be in working order. Fortunately for me my right ear is my worst ear so I use that headphone exclusively.The ""TUNe"" setting is very difficult to adjust it crackles and squeals until just the right spot is found.I would not have ordered this item had I known it was not going to be in good working order. In my view your Quality Control Dept. did a very poor job!"
4,i like these,i got them because i did not want to bother others if i was watching tv at night. they are very easy to install and use. the headset is comfortable and the sound is good. i recommend them.
4,Great headphones for the price,I can walk all over my house while listening to music or my online radio. No need to lug around my laptop to listen to my radio from Brazil. Once in a while it drops the signal (may be due to interference) but other then that it is great. I highly recommend it.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This refurbished headphones gave me trouble from time to time, like when the receiver fail to open which causes the headphone not to operate. Right now it still works fine, but it would be better if it doesn't give that that kind of problem. The sound quality is nothing special. I would have bought a new one if I knew it would give me this problem."
1,Didn't Work,Couldn't get product to work with my TV. Instructions were poor. Manufacturer did not respond to e-mail inquiries about problem. Amazon return policies are great though.
2,The Noise its annoying and its hard to Tune.,"The noise is truly annoying, even if i tune it in the right frequency there is still a annoying background noise. And its few feet away from cable box or DVD. Tuning it is really hard (takes me at least 3 mins to find a audible frequency). The auto turn off its a bad idea, at least for me. I cant believe this was made by Sennheiser. The reason i did not return it was because the same day, my sister was clean the house so she also threw the receipt and original box."
2,"For TV, it works fine, but only when it works","Bought this for my wife to use to watch TV when I'm asleep. Unfortunately, the device has no on or off switch - it is supposed to sense input and activate itself. However, either through the mini-jack or the RCA cables, that doesn't work reliably on our TV. The device often fails to activate itself (requiring a trip to the TV to pop the connector in and out) or, worse, turns itself off in mid-use, blasting your ears with static (since amplification is also weak, you need to have the volume way up on the headphones to get usable volume). It's also a pain to tune the signal with the dial - its extremely challenging to find the signal since it tunes for only the tiniest sliver of the dial's travel, and any twitch of your thumb loses it again.My wife has given up using it and is back to closed captions. Sigh."
2,ehh,"I bought these to go with my new turntable, so I could listen anywhere in my room or my dorm common room, possibly even outside. There seems to be a lot of noise and hissing whenever i use them, however. I would be sitting in my desk or reading on my bed, both not even a yard away, and the hissing would still persist. The tuning is awkward, as you have to be pretty precise to get the sound. The perfect frequency gives off a nice and clear sound, but it's sadly muddled with the noise previously mentioned. I tried it out once in the common room, which is literally right outside of the door, and my tinnitus just enjoyed that white noise very much. The comfort is all right. They don't hurt my ears after extended play, so that's a major plus. They do slip off pretty easily, which gets annoying when lying down and reading a book. definitely do not fall asleep with these on, else you wake up to blasting white noise as mentioned in many of the reviews."
4,Incorrect product description.,"In product description: ""In addition, the phones include replaceable parts, so users don't have to buy new headphones each time a part wears out"" There were no replaceable parts in the package!Sometimes base turns off even when there is sound to transmit. The input to base needs to be kept on high volume. Sound is good but not great."
2,Cheap headband - not comfortable - smallish,"Very uncomfortable. I have a medium sized head and while there is adjustment for length there no adjustment head size. Let me explain. The headband is a solid cheap flat preformed piece of plastic. It is not even curved to fit a head. The head band only touches your head in one spot on top. It is made for small heads.I am wearing it now and after 10 min I feel like I have a vice on my head. My old (ten years) Sennheisers have a dual band which curves to the top of the head. These weren't cheap either. Boo Sennheiser!Sound is as expected - OK for RF. Not as good as Bluetooth.They are not rechargable. The battery compartment is accessed by removing the ear piece. There are two small tabs which hold the ear piece on. I can't see these tabs lasting very long.Whoops, just had an eyeball pop out. Man these are tight."
1,Did not work out of the box,"The headphones never worked from day one. The TV out works fine and the base station light comes on but the headphones never made a peep. Unfortunately, I did not open the box until after one year had passed, so I don't think Sennheiser will help me out."
1,Waste of Money,Don't waste your money.. this company used to be associated with quality.. I couldn't find an ounce of quality in this purchase.. Besides they were broken!!
4,"Best option, for what I wanted","These headphones were the best option, for what I wanted.Good sound quality, wireless, AND (of coarse) great price > compared to others.We need to produce 'better', more socially/ environmentally conscious products, but that is something that we will have to work on. In the mean time, let's shop as smart as possible... Thank you for your time."
5,headphones,The item was priced right and arrived in a timely manner. The headphones work very well and we are pleased with them. I give the process an A+
1,A waste of money.....,I bought a set of reconditioned headphones from a different vendor. When I got them the right side had no audio and the left side hissed and the audio was no better then a set of 1 dollar headphones for a walkman. About a year ago I bought a set of Aucostic Research wireless headphonse from Amazon for about 100 bucks and they perform 1000 percent better then these. Stick with 2.4GIG technology and nothing less! Also about a year ago I bought a set of the Sony 900MHZ at Best Buy before I bought the Aucoutics and the sound quality was not great and the distance was poor as well. Hope this helps.
2,Disappointed!,"This headphones did not work properly from the start. They don't turn on when you turn the tv on , it takes about 10 min for them to come on. Then after 15 min they go off and you hve to turn the tv off and on again for the earphones to come on again, you have to keep doing this every 15 min. Bad deal."
2,I would not recommend this unit.,"I purchased this headset and wish I didn't. Here are the reasons why:1) Battery life is terrible!!!2) As stated with others, the signal drops all of a sudden and screeches in your ears!3) Cheap quality for the brand and money.4) Always having to tune the stupid thing as it somehow just goes out of tune.Not sure how others can rate this product with anything higher than two stars. It's not worth the money!"
1,"Chinese Knock-off, NOT a refurbished.","""Re-manufactured"" is NOT the same as refurbished. This is a Chinese imitation of the actual Sennheiser headphones. They're not a repaired set of German headphones, they're cheaply made in China.If you can catch the non-remanufactured ones on sale, the actual Sennheisers, do yourself a favor and get them they're worth the extra 20bucks. Hell they're worth an extra 30bucks.These don't sound anywhere near as good. They're flimsy and cheaply made. I even question that they conform to FCC standards as required by American law.."
1,Short-lived Junk,"After three days the headphones stopped working. Changed batteries...nothing. Checked transmitter...working fine. I now know why this product was at a price to good to be true. Spend the extra money not to deal with getting a replacement, which they will not provide."
2,Dissapointed,"This is way to much hassle to set up and use. I thought there was just a plug you put in your computer and it would work, but you have to plug into a receiver which plugs into a wall outlet. Not convenient at all. They also look and feel huge on your head. Better off buying a cheap pair of sennheisers with better sound quality."
2,Better books available,"Like the story of Goldilocks, this complilation had ""too much"" and ""not enough"". Too many short chapters, each by a different ""warrior-writer"" (including Bly, Campbell, Millman, and Martin Luther King) each with yet another definition of just what a warrior is suppose to be -- the silliest chapter had to be Gloria Steinem's admiration of Wonder Woman. There wasn't enough of a common thread, or enough detail, to get a handle on what concepts was actually being discussed.Not a bad book I suppose; but not very useful or insightful either. Throw in being politically correct and new age and it had me wishing Mark Twain or Dave Barry could review it and see what they made of it."
3,Pet Taxi - medium,"Great price, sturdy, very easy to put together. You DO have to double check the bar (hinges) on the top of the door to make sure it is completely inside the hole on the taxi EVERY TIME you use it. (This was my reason for giving a 3 star rating.) In my opinion this bar needs to be a little longer."
1,This book needs to be banned from the classroom,"I have had to teach with this book several times, and it always disappoints. If you are looking for a reader that will: 1. foster interest and discussion 2. get students thinking. This is not the book for you. If, as most readers do, you want a couple classic studies and a whole lot of filler, this is your book."
5,adire cloth poster,This poster serves as a visual aid for a 1st grade art lesson I have developed on African Art. The symbols depicted give the young artists ideas for their crayon resist project. The poster is of high quality.
5,Buy in bulk!,"Truly the best bang for your buck! This is six (6) large butane cannisters, 150mg each. It's not those baby 5"" tall ones you see in most stores. These are like 10"" tall, 3"" in diameter, and there are SIX! :) If you have a lot of refillable lighters and go through this stuff like crazy, you'll love these!"
2,butane,"this butane was recomendedfor the pro torch so i ordered it,but the tips did not fit the torch.ordered six cans.ended up useing bernzomatic it works.very disapointed.they should'nt recomend this butane for the solder it-pro torch.hard to send something like butane back."
5,Son of a son of a sailor,This is a great product. I didn't know there was a difference in butane gas until I purchase a survival jet flame lighter through Amazon. I use butane I purchased off the shelf locally and my new lighter didn't work. With some research I found there were different grades of butane. I purchased Blazer and problem solved.
4,Good live recording,"Yes,this is a very good live devo cd i definatley recommend this plus it has many many good songs on it."
2,"Not so great, you can pass and not miss much","Album begins as a real snoozer, with a set of acoustic numbers, yawn, jocko-homo, always seemed a little long on the albums and it is reallllllllllllllllly looooooooong here, like it will NEVER END. Next two songs are also acoustic and equally long and boring. DEVO is not an acoustic band. The rest just sounds like the same songs on the album, but a bit slopier. Quite probably the ugliest album cover ever conceived. Who cares, this is an easy pass."
1,Collar Comments,"This collar is heavy for a small dog. The ""sonic"" noise is easily heard by all of us. The directions suggest giving it ""several weeks"" to work. Apparently not waterproof. Our dog was quieter for a day, but continues to bark--at the noise the collar makes, it seems, as well as the initial motivator.The collar that holds the battery-sound box is a piece of poorly adjustable nylon webbing.I'm looking for a better tool."
1,Bark collar review,"The collar packaging states one size fits all, but this is not the case. I bought the collar for a chihuahua, but the collar was so big it was useless."
2,Not effective,"Not only is this collar WAY TOO big for my 15 pound dachshunds to wear -- We can also hear the ""ultra-sonic"" beep loud and clear. I don't know what is more annoying -- listening to my dogs bark thier brains out - or the ear splitting tone that this lets out."
4,A TONGUE IN CHEEK LOOK AT CLASSIC AMERICAN FOOD PRODUCTS,"This is a short, fun book about convenince food products ranging from Minute Rice to Spam to Hawaiian Punch. It includes a brief history of each product, with sidebars containing fun facts. It is fully illustrated with photos and reproductions of old ad campaigns (which depending on your age may not seem that old!)This book would make a nice gift for those interested in food, but maybe not for the serious food snob."
5,Fantastic for Those Who are Working with Alchemical Emblems,"This book is a true treasure for those who are working with alchemical emblems. Yes, there are not many explanations of the emblems, but then again the purpose of working with the alchemical emblems is to stimulate the emergence of the information coming from one's deeper wisdom, which is facilitated by contemplating and meditating upon the emblems.Adam McLean has a number of courses which can assist those who don't know how to start working with emblems. They are excellent."
1,Great wiper with poor finish,"I have purchased two sets of these wiper blades that have the Carbon Fiber Finish. The blade itself is very good and I would have rated this item high except that after a couple of months being on my Titan the Carbon Fiber Finish is flaking off and turning brown. I would not recommend these wiper blades if you want good looks and good performance. I believe PIAA needs to look at the finish problem on these blades and design one that will hold up for a reasonable amount of time. With the finish flaking off and turning brown, the look like wore out old wiper blades."
4,A must for a raw food trial; very helpful how-to information,"This book was a daily bible for two of us vegans who completed a 30 day raw food diet intersperced with 2 juice cleanses. Good basic how-to info on sproutingf, cultured foods and dehydrating and survival tips for sweeteners and condiments. Chocked full of recipes and ideas."
2,Inorganic Azymuth,"One of the most impressive (and attractive) things about early Azymuth releases was their ability to craft funky, soulful, organic jazz. They relied heavily on Analog synths such as Moogs, Fender Rhodes, slapping basslines, and unusual mixing on the drums. They switch to digitial synth on this CD with very, very bad results. The Fender Rhodes was what provided much of the signature Azymuth sound. The use of a sampled Rhodes voice on a digital keyboard is not only jarring, but is also cheesy, dated, and removes all semblance of feel from the keyboard lines. The soul is still there, but masked by a horrible tone. The bass does much less slapping and is turned down considerably in the mix, hiding the classic Azymuth sound further. Perhaps they were trying to be poppish, save money on recording, or the Fender Rhodes was just too damn heavy to carry anywhere. Azymuth music deserves better than this, and the group should have known it."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought this bag and it was so crappy!! The logo and the handle felt like plastic to me---definitely not a nice prada. Weird because I ordered a cosmetic bag from amazon and that was beautiful and authentic. I don't know where amazon got these, but they got ripped off."
1,"May work, but not here",This FM antenna did not work in my situation. Probably too much electrical wiring in the placement area. Cheap dipole single wire antenna works at least as good. Seller did accept return and refunded in full.
1,A single wire works better,"Been gathering dust in my attic for 7 years, I took it down to see if it would improve the reception over the included thin wire with my new RX-A2000 receiver. It not only didn't improve it, it worsened it. Back to the attic, or frankly, to the garbage can. I wish I could say otherwise, but for me (a wood frame house, large metro area), it struggled to tune 100,000 watt stations.Your mileage may vary. I can't recommend."
4,Godar is Goodar,It works as advertised and has provided solid reception while being inconspicuous. Fits neatly under our radio. The only rabbit ears we look at now are on the rabbit.
2,What new frontier?,"Let's explore what this book was about. First: there were a few stories about some of the characters in ""New Frontier"". Second: half the characters in the book were ""old characters"". Third: nothing!The entire story was nothing more than the tragedies of each and every character. There was no mission until the end of volume one (consiquently no exploration of this new frontier). The characters in this storyline hadn't even met yet! It wasn't until volume 2 that this meeting even occurs (and we won't even get into how jumbled that plotless ""story"" was!).So, congrats to Peter Davids effort at a new storyline, but a disapointing ""4"" to this unusually flawed and plot hole filled result. Maybe it will be better in the later volumes. I certainly hope so."
2,Peter David can do better,A great concept but a pedestrian story. C'mon Peter David you can do better!
4,Hats off to Peter David and John J. Ordover,"I was very skittish about a new crew and ship because it's been done very weakly in the past (to wit: Voyager). But as other Peter David entries in the series have been, 'New Frontier' is far superior to the vast majority of Star Trek novels. There is a definite rhythm to his pacing and each chapter plays in the reader's head precisely like a movie scene. Dr. Selar's inclusion was a pleasant surprise. An even bigger surprise was imagining Suzie Plakson playing her in the throes of ponn farr! I must join others in complaining about eventually spending $16 on what could have been put in at least two $5 volumes. If you need any evidence that Paramount bought Pocket, this is a major piece of it"
4,nice socks,My girlfriend had gotten a pair of 'slipper socks' from the hospital and said that these were thicker and of better quality.
1,not okay,"Since when is it okay for a minister to practive medicine without a license. Saying that using ""proper discipline"" instead of medications will cause a lot of problems for those with children who suffer from severe psychiatric disorders. We have learned so much about neurology, we cannot just throw it away or blame the children."
2,Do Not Stick,Labels are suppose to be permanent but they do not stick. Had to use double stick tape to keep them on.
2,Not removable!,"i bought this thinking i can get this off my documents easily but when i take it off, i take some of the paper off!"
5,The Best album yet...,Balance 005 is the best album of its kind. Holden's unique music is a kind on its own. The guy got crazy beats - tunes that i havnt heard anywhere. Disk 1 is the best out of both CD's.
4,A unique sound,This album is unique the sound is new and refreshing...I know some peoples have written very bad review about it (Chris Fortier is good but not amazing...Hernan Cattaneo ??? why do you love him because everybody esle do? his mix are so boring there is nothing to say about them...if at least you had named djs like Sasha or John Digweed but Hernan Cattaneo????)First of all for those who search a dance album go chek somewhere else this album is more experimental and have more to do with techno than trance althoug James Holden is known for his famous tune Nothing which has been played by a lot of trance Dj including Tiesto and Ferry Corsten this album is somewhat different...James Holden has always had a unique style using digital pro-tools to add special techno-like effects to his mixing and I must admit I'm the kind of guy who love all these fine details...those who just want heavy beat should go buy on of these horribles albums mixed by Peter Rohaufer they will be totally satisfied ;).
5,The best storm you've never heard!!!!1,"I happened to find this cd at a mall,as it was the last 1 left. I had heard their ""Take what you want"" and ""Over the Edge"" releases,but was not prepared for the coming storm. ""Reign of Love"" starts off the cd perfectly,which is followed by ""Next to You"",another very good tune. Kelly Hansen is very underrated as a vocalist(he is now fronting Foreigner),and the rest of the band plays solid throughout this release. I'm not sure what the explicit lyrics are,although there are quite a few sexual overtones throughout,but it is no worse than any Poison release.The original cd had a naked woman on the machine,but she has since been removed. Favorite tracks include: Reign of Love,Next to you,Lock me up,Let it Slide,and Young Man. Check this one out!"
3,whats a young man to do?,"The first three songs absolutely RAWK!!! After that, very mediocre, easily forgettable. And oh boy, another 80's Hair band doing a song called ""Temptation"". Was there a law passed that hair bands had to do a crappy ballad called ""Temptation"" or ""Forever""? Band is a novelty because 2 guitar player were younger brothers of guitar players in Quiet Riot, and the singer is currently singing for what is passing itself of as Foreigner nowadays. Original artwork did not have the girl, only the empty chair."
3,What about the average Joe/Jane?,"Many of the examples the author used were of people who already had more than most people do (money, education, connections, high paying salaries that they are just tired of).Check out Claire on page 11. She lives in London, wants a second home, is planning a weekend trip to the South of France, has a great job and benefits. Has a nice husband and home. What is her problem? Maybe she needs a shrink to figure out what her unhappiness really stems from but that's another book.The author should have used cases concerning more ordinary folk. She seemed to be appealing to upper class, globe trotting, burnt out executives who are whining because they feel they are missing out on something. Maybe that cute little pony they didn't get as a child.Claire...try yoga, buy a pony....get a grip."
3,Now What,"Now What is a no-nonsense coaching tutorial for facilitating major life changes. Business and life coach Laura Berman Fortgang gives a succinct introduction that is timely and relevant and then gets straight to the point: the first exercise toward finding clarity for a new life direction.This book is an active hands-on workbook that offers key insights, practices, and client success stories to get you moving forward. As with anything worth doing well, ""this work takes attention, focus and self-reflection,"" but boasts a ninety percent effectiveness rate. Although the author's expertise has revolved largely around career choices, any life circumstance can call for redirection. Fortgang points out what many of us are feeling within: a general (even if unconscious) movement by humans toward a magnified importance for meaning, and toward honoring ""those parts of ourselves we have allowed to become dormant."" Clear and practical, Now What makes a solid contribution to the self-help field."
3,Our Lady is everywhere!,"This is a short and interesting book in which varying people share 1-2 page accounts of events in their lives--big or small--for which they attribute a positive outcome to the Blessed Virgin. Put together, the book reminds us that Mary is with us always, both in good times and bad times."
2,Not..Thrilled....,"Okay, so I saw these shoes and felt there were so different I just had to have them! When I got them though I was not won over. I loved the concept of the shoe, the lace up is cvery cool, but the shoe is poorly built and not even worth being worn even for the attention in my mind. THese shoes are not practical for those who are chic but on the go...(and I wear heels everyday) The only pro: For those with large calves these boots are semi adjustable so if you can bear the pain then you may consider checking them out...I have literally worn them 2 time in 3mos and each time I carried flats! Eh...definitely not thrilled...at all..."
2,The usual invectives,"The usual cabal...and purveyors for the cult of victimology (ie.Maxine Water, Michael Dyson, etc.) The film starts offs by revisiting the 1980's context for this vibrant musical genre/culture, but quickly degenerates into conspiracy theories, finger pointing and little acknowledgment by the ""culture"" for its misguided dogma; whereas the `Message' by Grand Master Flash was critical of their social environment, the subsequent generations have glamorized apathy, materialism and violence as central to the character of Hip Hop."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"I bought this video because it had high reviews. I was very disappointed because it looked like a home made video. I watched it once and when my husband saw it, he told me not to show it to our son. Its cast is all girls and its music and presentation is not appealing.I don't like it that it teaches the numbers by showing little girls that sway their hip and wave their hands from one side to the other. I think this is not an effective way of teaching numbers."
2,It was nothing like I expected,I wanted a predominant Mandarin speaking video for my child. This was not it.
4,My 2 year old loves it!,My 2 year old loves this video. She requests to watch it and it keeps her mesmorized. Even more important she is learning...after watching it just a few times she was able to count to 5 and was saying hello in Chinese...now she's able to count to 10 and sings along with the songs as well. She loves watching the little girls and hearing them speaking. This video is also done in a very 'real-life' manner and proceeds slowly - which I feel removes most of the dangers of TV watching for this age.
2,Needs Pinyin,"If you want your child to learn a few things in Mandarin, this is a fun little video. However, I was hoping to use this as a teaching tool to help me and my daughter learn Mandarin together. But I was very disappointed to find there is absolutely no Pinyin whatsoever and nothing included with the DVD to supplement the lessons.The sound is not so great so you may need a Chinese/English dictionary to make your best guess as to exactly what is being said and which tone is used. The English subtitles are nice to have but simply not enough - plus there is no ""word for word"" translation anyway.I DO like the content and the way it's presented, but to me it needs more for clarity - especially for such a beautiful and complex language and for those of us who want to get it right."
4,Could use a face lift,"I'm glad I purchased this DVD because my daughter does seem to enjoy watching it and the lessons are effective. That being said, the quality of the video and audio is pretty poor and this DVD could definitely use a face lift. Also the pace is a little too slow in my opinion."
3,"not too bad, not too good",We watched it once and hope to play it again. My 2 year old liked it ok.But neither she nor my wife nor I have wanted to watch it again. It is more like a duty than a pleasure for me.
5,Dogwalker Movie is Outstanding,"I highly recommend this movie. It is a realistic portrayal of a victim of abuse who escapes, and with difficulty and help from another older victim of abuse makes a new life for herself as a dogwalker.The acting, directing, and photography are all very good. Support independent film makers and buy a copy of this movie now!"
3,friendship and dogs,"not quite what i expected when ordered,but a pretty good movie overall.shows how people can change when given the chance."
3,average movie,I wasn't impressed with this movie. I liked the dogs in the story. I also liked the the old lady character. I wouldn't recommend the movie.
5,Dogwalker,"Delivery was on time. A little too early, but that's what I get for ordering it too early."
2,The lost Cure album?,"Whats with all the new bands? If you don't all sound like Nickleback, you sound like 80s bands. Case in point: Shout Out Louds and their pale imitation of Head on the Door era Cure. Wait...thats only for the first few tracks...then they return to Sweden and sound like the Cardigans. Wait...now they sound like Robert Smith fronting Thompson Twins. I'm confused. Pick a band and rip them off, but don't rip off everyone under the sun. Not horrible, but mediocre at best."
1,rip off,"This is a perfect example of the problem with contemporary pop/rock. Nothing original here, just rip offs of music from the past. Go buy the real stuff. Leave this glorified coverband alone."
1,Not As Well Made As You Think,"We ordered a set of these thinking it was a bargain. However after just a week, the stainless coating on the knives is starting to come off and the knives vibrate if you tap them against the side of your hand. Also, these are not made in the Japan as you might think. They are made in China where the quality of stainless steel is poor! My advice to anyone that bought these is to send them back now while you still can. If you are contemplating buying this product don't! Yamazaki makes great flatware, but this line is not one of them."
3,"Well made, but very BIG and HEAVY! Didn't like feel.","I read all the reviews before ordering this, all were positive, so I went ahead and ordered. When package arrived it was very heavy, and of course, so are all the pieces. The pieces all seem to be much bigger than normal.I was very happy with my current set, but we had lost too many pieces. The salad fork in this new set was bigger than our current set's dinner fork! The tines on the forks seemed a bit big and blunt. Also, one thing they didn't show in the pictures but really seemed uncomfortable to me was the shape of the handles (from a side view). There is a big bend in the handle of every peice (except the knives) which just doesn't feel normal. I'm not a little person, I'm 6'1"", 290 lbs., so its not that I have dainty hands.If interested in buying this set, try to find a store to test the size and feel before placing order.I'm returning the set."
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE,This set is great for the money. I looks as if I paid $600+ if this was in a store. Heavy & strong can scoop ice cream and not bend the spoon. the one thing I did not like is you need to hand wash the all of the knifes so they do not get little rust spots on them.That is why I only gave 4 stars over 5.
4,A good book,"This is actually a great book if you're into Sailor Bob. I would have given it 5 stars but I didn't really like all the teaching James does in the beginning of the book. I found myself getting impatient and wanting him to just dive right in with some of Sailor Bob's teachings or hear more details about his visit. But once we get past James' summary of what he thinks non duality (Truth) is all about, the book really flows well. Some of the dialogues at the end of the book are truly great. And it's fun to hear all the details of Bob's trip and tour of America. Also, James shares lots of personal details about his life and search which takes a lot of guts and makes the book very rich."
5,Understanding is all,"Quoted from the book :- ""Please keep in mind that non-duality is, essentially, a viewpoint and appears to clash with other viewpoints regarding spiritual truth. The core of non-duality is presence awareness. The key to our true nature lies in the present moment-the right here,right now that have always been and will always be"".The statement is concise and clear.This book 'Living Reality' makes an excellent reference book on non-duality."
2,Don't bother,"Why is it so hard to find a good nose trimmer?? about ten years ago I bought an excellent Panasonic brand trimmer-- a model they apparently no longer make- -but lost it a few years back. I bought this one thinking it would be comparable. Wow, was I wrong. not only did it not trim very effectively, it broke after only a few months. it's not worth the hassle of sending it back in for repair. steer clear of this one."
1,DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!,Do not waste your money. I purchased this product and shortly afterwards returned it. It is utterly worthless.
3,The Diary of a Chambermaid,We read this for bookclub & watched 2 movies made from this book. The book is not as naughty as was expected.
2,Always the same,"This book will tell you the experiences of a maid and what she does to her patron and what her patron does to her, as all these kind of books, after you read half of it you will know what will happen in the next page, in the middle of the book is a murder that nobody can solve and after that is a robbery that also nobody can solve, so this book is a waste of time, nevertheless let me tell you that what happened with that maid in 1900 is exactly what happen with the maids today."
4,Always Primo,"A moral man. A man of integrity, empathy, intelligence and more. I wish I had known him. And the best way I can, is to read about him and to read what he wrote. Time well spent."
5,"Our Wildest Dreams has the ""new"" right stuff","I connected with the words of Joline Godfrey. Her evaluation on what women are doing in business, helps all of us see the opportunities to do things differently. The first chapter where she talks about the right stuff struck home - women needing connection with others, seeing people as whole individuals, wanting balance in life, seeing business as a creative outlet, are all principles she dives into - they make sense for those seeking to more than financial goals. There are many bottom lines in life - the women business owners the book reviews get it and are designing business with a bigger picture in mind. Thank you Joline for shifting my thinking - I was already headed in that direction - your book help me get there a little faster."
5,Edge Of Your Seat Read!!!,This story will keep you on the edge of your seat with the drama that occurs in this book! I loved it and didn't put it down until I finished it. I especially loved the ending and I hope that Kimberley will write a story about Special Agent Nicolai Montgomery. I would love to learn more about him and his special abilities to solve crimes.
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"I read this book based on the reviews posted. They were wrong. I didn't care about these characters at all. The murder mystery was not compelling. And the characters were not believable.The prose was beyond purple. The writing style was vulgar. I did not appreciate the author's use of ""slang"" terms to describe female anatomy.The dialogue was awkward. No one talks like this. But more importantly, I didn't buy the ""connection"" between the main characters. They had absolutely no chemistry.Take my advice, skip this book."
3,Somewhat Disappointed...but okay,"At first Marks ""strong attraction"" was sweet but then everything happened sooooo fast between Mark and Maya; and there was nothing to anticipate anymore after page 9 between them u could predict every scene after that. Before I was less than half through with the book I was bored with their relationship. It was annoying how Mark treated her like a fragile doll too.I gave it three stars only because it has a good message that its not about where you come from but where you are going. Oh yea and the steamy sex too."
1,I can't even finish it!,"Some might call it unfair to rate a book based on reading only half of it, but I consider it punishment enough that I even read half of it. This book is a total waste of time and money! The storyline could have some real potential if it were carefully worked out. The dialogue it choppy and doesn't have a maturity to it. The characters' individuality isn't developed before they're tossed into a romance which is soap-opera (and not the good ones) like. There are certain expectations that readers have when presented with a cop-murder mystery novel and this novel by no means even comes close! It's pretty painful just trying to read a page of this novel and it will probably be disgraded very shortly."
3,good then bad,"I first got my drive and it worked like a dream, I would describe it like all of these other 4 or 5-star people are giving this. But now I've had my drive for about a year, and I'm starting to get the same problems that the 1 or 2-star ratings say they have. It used to work perfectly, but now it doesn't. My guess for possible reasons may be accumulated dust in the drive or some manufacturing glitch of the product. My drive doesn't support UDMA 33 either."
5,Fantastic!!!,"Love this album! Criminal that the record company went to hell and this didn't get proper promotion. Lyin' to Myself should have been a number one song - and the entire album should have been top 10.David Cassidy proves again that he has always had talent, and was never a flash in the pan. It's just unfortunate that his timing has always seemed to be off.Whether you are a David Cassidy fan or not, this is just a great album."
4,The Spares cd,"I love this cd!! Great music!! Very orginal, country bluegrass sounds.The only thing I was unhappy about was that the jewel case was broken when I got it.I did receive my shipment in good time.Happy with this cd!"
3,A usefull introduction to Lakhovsky work,"This review needs three opinions.1.- About edition work. I hoped more from this book, poor edition work, a lot of photocopies and bad photocopies,very very little and blurred text and photos. note: 2 from 1 to 5.2.-Technical information: Indubitably here you can find info difficult to find at Internet. I believe which if you have a technical engineering degree and read books from Lakhovsky, Tesla, D'Arsonval and others you can build a strong compilation (far better than this book) of oscillating healling waves that will drive you to a full understanding of biologhy and MWO, electronic's and MWO and at last health. Any way it's a good starting place. Note: 4 from 1 to 5.3.- About Amazon and desertfox9 good as usually do. Note: 5 from 1 to 5"
4,A good introductory text,This book reviews the various schools of psychology using a simple style that is easy to read and understand. It provides enough depth on each system to satisfy the practitioner and provides solid explanations for the beginner to understand with ease. An excellent introductory psychology text.
4,Error In item Description,"Just to warn potencial buyers, this item's description is in error! According to Cokin, the equivalents Cokin/ISO of the Blue series is: 020/80A, 021/80B, 022/80C (holds for both A and P series). Thus, this item should be titled: ""... Filter A021 80B (blue)A020"" Hope this note is usefull!"
3,interesting,"a book obout elizabeth written by herself in her own words,but she has left out many things maybe too shocking for that period and updated just to the early 60's.nice"
2,"Sure it LOOKS good, BUT........","I purchased this book to assist me in making better quilt blocks. However, I was very disappointed that block measurements were NOT given. Block patterns were supposed to be transferred to fabric, but did not include the measurements of each section. This was frustrating if you are a careful piecer and want to make sure each block is the correct size and don't like to trace. Instead, the piecer is forced to trace every section, which isn't practical for larger-sized quilts.The lack of block dimensions made this book frustrating for me. I would recommend it only for people who like to trace, and don't mind the extra chore of photocopying the patterns, adding seam allowances etcetera before getting started."
3,Great book for Oahu Hiking,"This is basically a great hiking book, but it's woefully outdated. On Oahu, quite a few trails have access problems due to private land. The access changes from time to time. And it's these changes that are not up to date. BTW: you can get updates from the author's website, which is helpful. But even with these, lots of outdated infoI bought the Kindle version. The maps need to optimized for this device (increase contrast). Hopefully, the author is working on an update."
3,Need higher resolution maps,"the maps need to be of higher resolution, I have seen copies of the book and the maps are way better then what's they used for the kindle version..."
5,I love the beats on these tracks!,"I really enjoyed this CD and I'm very particular when it comes to industrial music. When I need to get pumped up in the morning I always pop this CD in. I love the lyrics too, they really bring out somewhat of a sexual, adrenaline rush. Its a really good buy!"
2,Old KMFDM,They do sound like KMFDM if you lisen to the old stuff. Don't think you are getting anything to lisen to. Don't think you are getting KMFDM's Money or newer. This is more background noise. I use it for long drives in the desert and something playing while I read a book/watch TV/play video games. For that it is great. Just something in the background.
5,A great lil book to keep in your purse,The full copy of this is an unbelievable read. I recommens everyone looking for a more cosmic life to read it. This small pocket version is great to keep in your purse or brief case when you need alittle insiration and guidance.
1,This book is not worth reading,"I am very sorry I spent my money on this book.I do not know why it seems to have been popular, I got very little out of it. I am being generous giving it a #1."
1,Can we say marketing?,"James Redfield has figured out yet another way to scam out money from would-be believers! If you're reading this, don't buy this book! I know that Amazon wants to generate sales and everything, so I'll suggest some alternatives. Why not browse some of the more classic works of philosophy instead of wasting your time on some obscure man's generlizations. Please do not contribute to his lost meaning."
1,insipid waste of money,"It's not that the ideas espoused in the book are dangerous or bad. It's just that they are presented in the most banal, humorless, grating fashion under the guise of a poorly-developed adventure novel. I worry about the fact that millions of people have paid full price for a book that is written on an eighth grade level and contains only the most anemic attempts at philosophy. As if that weren't bad enough, people seem to be buying the sequel and the various handbooks with equal enthusiasm (and probably the astrology charts advertised at the end of the book). Even for people who, like me, have given up on Christianity, this book is not the answer."
1,Incredibly bad!,"This book is so bad, the english language lacks a word to accuratly describe it. That this book has been such an incredible hit is really worrying. It leads one to think that the amount of airheads, spaced out nitwits or just plain morons is lot's higher than anyone had ever imagened possible. Without even saying a single word about the 'story', it's incredible that a book that is so poorly written found such a huge audience! And about the story....let's keep it at this: LOL!"
1,idiotic,"If I really love a book, I will lend it out but insist I get it back. If its interesting but not a page-turner I will give it away. I threw this out when I was done with to spare anyone else the agony of trying ot read it. Just plain terrible."
4,CELESTINE PROPHECY,"WHILE WAITING FOR AUTO REPAIRS, I FOUND A THRIFT SHOP TO BROWSE, AND PICKED UP THIS BOOK FOR A DOLLAR. WHEN I GOT HOME, I READ THE BOOK IN 6 HRS. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!! I JUST LOVED IT! IT WAS AN ADVENTURE, AND IF YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL PATH, AND NOT SURE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS YOU EXPERIENCE ALONG THE WAY, THIS BOOK WILL GENTLY GUIDE YOU, AND CONFIRM THAT YOUR EXPERIENCES ARE JUST PERFECTLY NORMAL. I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF MUCH OF THIS FOR YEARS, WITHOUT EVER READING A THING. ENJOY!!"
4,Worth a read,"Whether or not one chooses to take the ideas put forth in the Celestine Prophecy and make a personal religion out of them, I think that Redfield has some interesting thoughts. The novel is obviously fiction, but the ""insights"" can have application in one's own life. Maybe you make the Celestine Prophecy your Bible and subscribe to the newsletter. Maybe you just start thinking a little more about the spiritual aspect of life. Either way, I think that the Celestine Prophecy's insights are worth a look and should get the mental and spiritual juices flowing. I bought the book a few months after reading it, and I don't regret that. If I read the sequel(s), though, I'll check them out of the library. I am a Christian."
1,Not pleased,I felt like this seller was not honest wth me. I ordered from the new book and I was sent a used book and it was written in. I emailed the seller and never recieved an email back. Will not be shopping back on amazon again.
5,Cokin Warm Filter adds cozy skin tones,"This filter is great for portraits. It is a warm, tannish-orangish color that enhances Caucasian skin tones. Flashes can sometimes wash out skin tones, as can too much sunlight, and this replaces or maintains a warm glow. Also nice when used in conjunction with a blurring filter (diffuser) which hides tiny imperfections and softens the whole look.This can also be used with landscapes to create a different mood, to warm up an Autumn or desert scene for instance. I have used Cokin filters for years and find they are a great way to add a personal touch, a surreal look or a more professional finish to your photographs."
5,Mei Mei does it again!,"""Play and Learn Chinese with Mei Mei"" (Volume 1) has been a favorite children's educational video for years, and now there are two more videos by Mei Mei Hu available! ""Play and Learn Chinese"" volumes 2 and 3 are equally as wonderful as the first. Volume 2 teaches the concepts ""Who is this"" and ""What are you doing"". Volume 3 teaches ""Where is it"" and ""What is this"". Both are excellent and are a must for anyone learning Mandarin Chinese, including adults."
5,Dalton and Primrose make you want to play the viola!,"Playing the Viola is a great book for beginners and experienced violists alike. Primrose gives his opinions about technique, repetoire, and a music career. It is much better than his autobiography which reads as one big pat on the back from himself. There is less pompousness in this book and more good ideas. I'd say this is a must read for all violists!"
4,a collection of works by tseng kwong chi,"This book has wonderful reproductions of Tseng Kwong Chi's photographs. It also has an accompanying text which is informative, yet brief. Therefore, I found this book to be very helpful in my studies of Tseng Kwong Chi more for the quality of the photographic reproductions than the textual information. However, information about Tseng Kwong Chi is readily available on the internet, so this did not pose a large problem. I highly recommend the purchase of this book. I gave it four stars instead of five, only because the relative lack of information."
2,Great effort to explain the hardships of coming to the US,"and adjusting to change, but I felt some of the situations did not portray the true way of life for Hmong teens.I'm surprised that with so many people editing and contributing feedback to this book, how come there were consistent Hmong spelling errors? I question why the only Hmong words that were used repeatedly were derrogative ones? ('Raum' which was meant to be 'ruam', meaning stupid)The pronounciation keys could use some work too.I do appreciate the interesting facts about the paj ntaub designs. This skill is being deprecated and the knowledge being written will be useful.This book should inspire Hmongs to create a voice that will ring true and represent the complicated emotions of growing up in America and holding on to your roots."
5,Great Book!,This book really made me understand what it was like during the war. I felt very bad for the girl in the refugee camp and then when she got to America her cousins acted strange. I would recommend this book to every girls/women everywhere.
2,A so-so book,"As a Hmong-American, I thought the book did a good job explaining parts of the Hmong culture and had interesting information about the Hmong people, despite the fact that some Hmong words were spelled incorrectly. But overall, I thought the book was only okay. The plot was basic and characters were not very well-developed. The reading level of this book would fit more with middle school kids, so I would only suggest it to kids in grades 6-8."
5,Xango is great juice!,I have been drinking Xango (just 2 ounces a day) for about 5 years and I wouldn't be without it. I was very satisfied with my last order from Amazon which arrived fresh and faster than I expected!
1,A disturbed man,"Mr.Levin's thinking can hardly be charicterized as rational. I was in a course of his at UC Davis, in which I experienced his thinking first-hand. His logic and his anything-but-linear mode of thought would drive even the most patient individual absolutely nuts. I dropped his course after 2 and a half weeks, but sometimes at night it still haunts me. This book is not recommended either."
4,Nice,"This toy is more a collectible toy, is very weak and it doens't have any functions or features to enjoy, but since my son takes care of the toys, then I guess it will be durable"
1,Loving Jenny,"Like so many modern books this book has too much explicit love making to even make the story interesting. Had I known, I would never have purchased it."
4,$35 ?!,"This is a simple transistor AM/FM radio (battery/solar powered). I paid $6 for it at Circuit City. Yes, six dollars!"
1,Not a scholarly source!,"Whatever the author's aesthetic reasoning for writing this, it should not be considered a history book (which is how this book comes up in an Amazon search). Numerous errors! People interested in Allen Allensworth or the town itself should visit the park, or read Delores Nason McBroome's _Seeking El Dorado: African-Americans in California_. Henrikson's seven-bulleted ""bibliography"" only specifically mentions four sources, which is alarming considering the growing amount of both primary and secondary sources. Not a history book OR a decent work of historical fiction!"
5,The Cincinnati Crime Book,I am extremely happy with my purchase. This is a fanasinating book. I have not finished reading it but it arrived on time and in description described.
3,"interesting and useful, usually","This book is written mostly for people who are going to MOVE to Japan or spend a lot of time there. It has some useful information in it for these people. It also has some too-brief sections on history and culture. As a manual or instruction book it may be a useful reference for someone moving to Japan - I can't comment on that. As someone just reading to gain insight into Japanese culture from the book, I would have preferred more indepth descriptions of the history and daily life. Half-hearted thumbs up."
2,Disapointing,"I read this book prior to spending a month working in Japan (as did another of my collegues who joined me there). Based on the information in the book we were extremely worried about what we would encounter in the work and social environment in Japan. We did not encounter the majority of the situations mentioned in the book although we were working very closely with a traditional Japanese company.As a female going to work in Japan, I only found 1 paragraph in the whole book which was relevant to this situation (the book focused on businessmen and their non-working wives traveling with them).The book does provide an interesting background but it is unlikely that you will encounter even half of the culture shocks mentioned."
1,Panic-inducing!,"On the eve of moving to Japan for a year, I read Culture Shock! Japan, and wow, did it get my heart beating fast. It portrays Japan as a minefield of devastating cultural faux pas that will leave us either completely ostracized from society or deported.But, upon arrival, it was quickly evident that the culture gap isn't nearly as big as the book claimed. Nor were the social consequences of making a slip-up.It's true this book was probably written for American business men trying to close some big deal, and I guess it does contain a quite a bit of valuable information about Japan, but trust me: that info can be found elsewhere, and in a book that won't give you second thoughts about going.Steer clear of Culture Shock! Japan."
1,You can do better!,"The only reason this book gets one star is because there are some useful lists in the back of the book about food, vocabulary, etc. But that information does not make it worth it to buy this book. The same information can be found in MANY books out there, preferably something without the negative slant this author seems to take towards Japan.Instead of simply showing the readers the differences between American and Japanese cultures, he insists on adding his own close-minded two cents. Though not overt, the author seems to look down on the Japanese people and culture, mostly because it is different from what he is used to. While there are many people out there who choose to believe a culture is wrong simply because it is different from what they are used to, I would prefer to read cultural books written by those that take a less judgmental approach."
4,A wel -written account of the Kibbo Kift and Green Shirts,"The history of the Kibbo Kift and the Green Shirts is well documented in the book Social Movements and theirSupporters - The Green Shirts in England by Mark Drakeford, Lecturer in Social Studies and Applied SocialStudies at University of Wales College of Cardiff. While the first chapter is devoted to a discussion of social sciencemethodologies, virtually impenetrable to the layman, the rest of the book is eminently readable and contains manyfirst-hand recollections of former Kindred and Green Shirts. Published in 1997 by MacMillan Press, it can be orderedonline at Amazon."
3,A case of mistaken idenity!,"I have not read this book yet, but it is clear to me from reading the reviews by Thomas More ""1535"" and lilbitz that they both have mistaken this title for Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You to Know About by Kevin Trudeau.While I agree with these reviews, at least in part, when applied to Trudeau's book, it is unfair to this book to show these reviews. Please give this book a fair chance."
2,Mmm... Déjà vu (but his theory is cool),"This book seems like a repetition of the firs one (Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity) which was very interesting and it helped me a lot. If you want to learn his theory about edit and organize todo list, you better buy that one."
5,David Allen Rocks,David Allen is the way to go if you want to get things done. This is a great little reminder tool to instill everything you learned in Getting Things Done. Short excerpts and reminders to keep you on track.
3,Pretty good,"This book was not bad. I almost gave it 4 stars, but there are some other great books out there. I have already read Allen's 'Getting Things Done', so some of the material was rehash for me. Overall, I think the book does what it sets out to do, and it does contain some useful tips."
1,Worst Book I have ever read,"""Ready for Anything"" is a pointless book full of information and ideas that anyone who went through school should already know. I learned a long time ago to write things down instead of keeping them in my head and I also know that being organized gives me more flexibility and less stress so why would I want to read a book in which Allen writes about basic concepts in a philosophical way. Yeah this book might be good for someone who didn't pick up on these basic skills in Middle school but for me it was a waste of my time which I'm sure Allen would agree is not a good use of my skills. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this book because maybe then you will open yourself up to more time for ""creativity"" which is the point of the book in the first place."
4,Great companion to 'GTD',"The second book by the man behind 'Getting Things Done'. I was always against books like this in the past, simply because it seemed too New Age and touchy-feely. However, I think I can get at least a little something out of whatever I read, so I gave it a go. Man, am I glad I did. This book, along with 'Getting Things Done', might do for my organizing what 'Controlled Cheating' by Larry Goldberg did for my weight loss. I definitely recommend this one. It's filled with advice on how to become more productive by explicitly stating your goals, taking small actions to complete projects, and having the right kind of view about your tasks and schedule."
3,"Great advice, but not told very well","I read David Allen's first book, Getting Things Done, and thought that his productivity system was great, so I quickly bought Ready for Anything (his second book) to find out what other advice he has to share.There are many useful insights in this book that elaborate on his GTD system and tackle different aspects of productivity. However, the points he makes could easily have been said in a far simpler - and a more structured - way. For most chapters, I can make out the main point from the title and a few sentences towards the end. Everything in between is usually very confusing, and I struggle to link it to the main idea or any experience in my life.The lack of structure and the unnecessary confusion shaved off two stars from my rating. Besides that, I believe David Allen's approach is a great way to approach productivity, and this book can help you understand some of the essentials of his system, and the reasoning behind them."
4,GTD Extended,"David Allen through this series of 'essays' broadens the GTD concept. One major advantage of this book over his previous one is that the GTD framework is extended past the 'operational' aspects of getting things done. For followers of GTD or those wanting a fresh look at managing today's ever conflicting demands, it's well worth a read."
2,"Too much repetition, not enough substance","After reading David Allen's first book ""Getting Things Done"", I was excited to read ""Ready For Anything"". I was hoping for a book that would go into more practical applications of the topics discussed in ""Getting Things Done"". However, I found quite the opposite.""Ready for Anything"" has 52 short chapters that discuss a range of topics. While the topics are good and the quotes spread throughout are excellent, I found each chapter to be far too conceptual and not practical enough. I wanted more specific advice.... not that the advice given was bad.While reading this, I found that the material was just a rehash of ""Getting Things Done"". I would highly recommend you pick up that book and pass this one over. 2 out of 5 stars."
2,Disappointing follow up to GTD,"I am a loyal follower of Getting Things Done (GTD) and have been using the system for almost 3 years. That being said, I was dissapointed in this book in that it is too ""spiritual"" and ""mindful"" at least for me. Most people that I know that use GTD are more process driven type people and do not really want to read about the ""fluffy"" stuff because most of it is common sense. The hard part is coming up with a system like GTD to actually have a framework with which to process information. Therefore, I highly recommend Mr. Allen's first book ""Getting Things Done"" if you are having trouble keeping up with the inflow of information we receive in this modern age."
5,Diamond Stone,"I am a Chef, and I don't know why it took me so long to get a diamond stone to sharpen my knives, but making this purchase it one of the best purchases I have made. It gets my knives sharper and in less time than using a japanese wet stone. If you cook professionally or just love cooking period, you need to purchase this stone to keep your knives sharp, it will make cooking more enjoyable and prep in less time."
2,Not Necessarily a Good Idea,"I was wondering how Gene Lees could follow up his book ""Inventing Champagne"" with another book about Lerner and Loewe, and the answer is that he couldn't. This is essentially the same book -- the same anectodes, the same zingers, the same observations retold. There's a little more information given about the early life of Frederick Loewe, but who cares about his professional boxing triumphs? Gene Lees also seems to harbor a personal distaste for Alan Jay Lerner, so I wonder about the purpose of this book, which was among his last."
5,excellent,"This was truly an inspiring book, Patti is down to earth and she lets you share her pain and to learn from her mistakes."
4,FAST READ,It was a fast read. It seemed to be theray for Patti. It was interesting. You can really see she feels her singing is her blessing. She remembered her roots through it all. Lots of postiive messages.
5,I could not put The Diva down until I had read every page!,Now I know why the caged bird sings...and does so very well! This was the best book I have EVER read. I thank you Patti for sharing your many blessings with all of us.
3,"Great portability, low charge rates.","If you're looking to buy a charger to hook up to your car battery, use this charger. But if you plan to charge it in your house, you should know the charge rates. It is capable of charging at 1-2 amps plugged into an AC outlet (wall outlet), which brings you to about 2 hours of charge time with a 3000 mAh 7.2V battery. Now, if you plug it into a car battery, you can charge at 4 amps, bringing you a charge time of about an hour.Yes, it has a low price, but don't be fooled. If you're looking to buy a high-quality charger, I sugget looking elsewhere. Try the ProphetPlus."
4,Nice cozy - so glad to re-discover Ngaio!,"I am a long-time fan of the traditional cozy made so popular by the stellar writing of such authors as Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Ngaio Marsh belongs in the same league, as does her main sleuth Roderick Alleyn. My recent re-discovery of her writing is awakening some fond memories, as it provides a wonderful escape into a different world and a different time. ""A Man Lay Dead"" is the first of her Roderick Alleyn series, and I would recommend it (especially on a rainy afternoon), with the caveat that younger readers may want to wait until they are a little older as some aspects of adulthood (sex and drugs) are intermingled in many of Ms. Marsh's plots. For those who love a good cozy, enjoy!"
3,Don't hide the findings!,"When a house party is interrupted by a murder, Alleyn must wade through a revolutionary plot as well as a web of secrets to find the killer.Good enough police procedural, although Alleyn is not your typical by-the-book policeman. Not exceptionally involving but it kept me reading. Marsh irritated me with the hiding-his-findings routine, though."
2,Poor Debut,"A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to Sayers and Christie. The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis. The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues. It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements. The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme. The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant ""Russian element,"" which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst. The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins."
4,New Ship...New Crew...New Possibilities,"Where the first volume of this series laid a good foundation, this book starts to flesh out additional members of the crew of the USS Excalibur, and gives the reader a whole new host of species to learn about. Commander Shelby, of Borg-collective-expertise fame, finally makes her appearance as first officer -- and we get to meet a Hermat engineer who is of dual sex. It makes for some gender bending interest that is humorous as well as enlightening. The short serial nature of these slim volumes leaves you hanging and waiting for more. A far cry from the usual novels that have to wrap up all the conflicts and resolve all the problems before you run out of pages"
3,"New characters with possibilites, resurfacing of Shelby.","Hated the shortness of the novels in this series, obviously split one novel into 4. This makes the book like a comic book series, you never know if the ends will be tied up or throw out the door. The underlying motivation of what makes each of the characters tick seems to be lacking, and the interaction between member of the crew doesn't seem to fit into the Starfleet norms. What bothered me most was the Vulcans seem so ""emotional"" with barely surfaced irritations and nasty comments to the other crew.Series has some good moments, but I suggest that all four novels be bought at once. Quick reading for each novel, good afternoon at the beach stuff."
4,"Excellent album, but...","I agree with any other reviewer- this is one of SAGA's best albums ever, but am I the only fan who takes offence at the awful drumsound, especially at the snare?I understand, that you can save a lot of money if you produce and mix an album by yourself, but...dear JIM CRICHTON, PLEASEspend a few dollars and leave the mixing of the drums to an expert like you did years ago- it's worth it!Thank you"
5,Saga as you like them!,"Network is a lot like the Saga I grew up with and its great to see they can still make good tunes. Guitar solos abound, and ""sing"" along with Michael's voice. They've all become very technically competent in this album in my opinion, and there is some interesting variety. This CD spends a lot of time in my auto player."
1,Haphazard adlib crap,"I cannont understand why this album is being regarded as so great. The songs are crap and sound like they are pieced together from umpteen other bands, and to top it all, they don't make sense. If you are into a band that did its best to keep up with the mainstream rock genre of the 80's but failed, go for Saga."
4,Definitely the best of their recent efforts,"I FINALLY got a copy of Network over the weekend, and while I'll stop short of saying it's their best ever (Silent Knight, World's Apart, Heads or Tales & my personal fave Generation 13 still rule) it is an impressive effort. There's plenty of breakdown of the individual tracks in the other reviews, so I'll hold off on that. But I haven't seen anyone commenting on the Bonus DVD with the 5.1 Surround mix of the disc. Maybe no-one else has it ? Anyway, it's REALLY well done. The full surround effect is immeadiately noticeable the second it starts, and since it's a DVD, there's accompanying video to go along with it. This takes the form of a TV (the graphics on the disc's cover) displaying the lyrics of each song, along with video to accompany the instrumental breaks. A very nice touch & definitely a welcome update to static lyric sheets. I hope this trend continues, both with subsequent Saga releases as well as spreading to other bands."
2,The Blue Last - deja vu all over again,"The Jury/Plant series is becoming increasingly repetitious. Melrose under cover, the boy living alone with a dog, a precocious girl, Jury agonizing over the war - I have read it all before. The minor characters from previous books are inserted, seemingly at random, here - for no apparent reason. The plot is thin; I knew the identity of the killer and the motive by page 80. I have read all of the books in this series, and probably will continue to do so. I hope that the author puts more thought into the details of future plots and less into repetitious situations. If this book disappoints, I suggest reading Elizabeth George's Lynley books; they are consistently well-written and entertaining."
2,Too many unanswered questions...,"I am a great fan of the Richard Jury series but this one was very disappointing. There were too many unanswered questions, characters thrown in that were never explained, main characters suddenly acting out of character and an ambiguous ending (which I won't go into in case you want to read this) that was annoying. One last complaint - if this book is taking place in the present day, then Richard Jury and the other children born during WWII would be in their 60's. Is Richard Jury - the heart throb detective - sopposed to be 65? Is the middle-aged woman who is the baby in question 62. How old is her mother? Eighty? If you are a Richard Jury fan you will probably want to read this book but be prepared to be disappointed. Too much atmosphere - not enough plot."
3,Unsatisfying ending diminishes enjoyment,"I always eagerly await one of Ms. Grimes' Richard Jury books and was so excited when ""The Blue Last"" was released. The characters are like old friends, which is one of the reasons I like series so much. You don't have to read 100 pages to ""get into"" the book. Richard and company were as amusing as always. This book, however, like the most recent Elizabeth George book, was disappointing because of the bizarre ending. I, for one, do not like cliff hanger endings when one has to wait a year or two to find out what happens next. My recommendation would be to hold off reading this book until the next Richard Jury book is out."
2,Confusing,"I was disappointed in this book. The only Grimes books I really like are the Richard Jury books, and even they are becoming unreadable. It almost seems like Grimes has written a fantasy book instead of a mystery. I am forever trying to get the dates to match up with the ages of the people in this book! There were also too many different story lines which didn't seem to have anything to do with each other. There could almost have been more than one book being written here. I did not like the ending, not because I don't want it to end the way it seems too, but because it is a useless ending. I suppose it has made sure that at least someone will read the next Jury book, just to see what happens. Overall, after being excited to see a new Jury book, I was highly disappointed in this one."
1,Terrible ending,The ending is totally unacceptable--what a terrible and senseless way to drop one of the most interesting characters in detective fiction.
2,Time to Put Richard Jury to Bed,"Martha Grimes is in a pickle. Without a doubt many of her Richard Jury fans won't read her other fiction. But how she is betraying the long-time fans of this series named after pubs with the stale, meandering plotting in ""The Blue Last."" Suspenseful, this book is not. (Grimes breaks every mystery-writing convention in the book. This used to be all right! Now she's writing like an amateur!) Seems to me it's time for Grimes to put Richard Jury and his oh-so-tiresome friends to bed, inaugurate another series. It will be like a bump in the road, but loyal fans will follow. But Mrs. Grimes, let's drop the sideshow acts and stick to the main plot!"
1,Where is the last chapter?,"Where is the last chapter to this book? What has happened to Martha Grimes? She hasn't told us the end of the story. Who is Gemma? Where did she come from? What happened to Melrose Plant?Is Jury dead? At this point do I, or any other reader who has followed this series for a good number of years, care? If this author has decided to become cutesy...did I hear the name Elizabeth George echo???...she should have told us/me before I paid Amazon's price for this hardcover edition. Oh, no...not again....What is the old saying, ""Once burned....,"" or perhaps ""I haven't bought the Brooklyn Bridge in the last 10 years either."" No more Martha...Is Martha living??? Perhaps the publishing company could not pay for the final chapter of the book?"" Whatever, I, the reader, feel cheated. And the customer is always right, Martha!"
2,The Blue Last,The book instead of being a mystery is very lyrical and rather putting you to sleep instead of making you want to finish it so you can see the end. The end doesn't mean much because you cannot get into the characters. It's a shame because most of her books are so very well written. I think she has written too much poetry lately.
1,Martha Grimes is clearly bored with her characters,"I'm glad she killed Jury in the end, because she clearly shouldn't write anymore books with him. This one went nowhere. It meandered without purpose and then died without reason. Don't buy this book."
2,The Blue Last,"Martha Grimes either hits the nail squarely on the head, or misses it completely. This title: big miss! A Chinese smorgasbord of a book (if there could be such a thing): take one from column A, six from column B, skip column C...The premise was intriguing--wartime London and something of Jury's past explained, but the book was thoroughly disjointed, with unnecessary subplots and unbelievable characters. When I turned the final page (at long last!), my only reaction was, ""What was that?"" Disappointed? Yes!"
2,The Blue Last,I have never personally read a Martha Grimes novel before reading The Blue Last. It was an interesting mystery filled with details. For some that may be excellent but for me I did not enjoy this novel as much as I had hoped to. I felt that the author cluttered the point up with unrelated issues. On the other hand the author did well with keeping you guessing up to the end. I also enjoyed how Martha in this story takes us back to the past and the bombing of WWII. That was a terrible time in history and is filled with memories that the main character Jury wishes to forget. It is a great theme in the novel that you can not escape the past and that it often holds glues to the present.
1,Too long with totally unbelievable ending.,I must try to remember NOT to buy Martha Grimes - Richard Jury novels.The novels get longer and longer -- filled with unnecessary and boring characters -- especially Melrose Plant.You end up reading 442 pages until Ms. Grimes tries to wrap everything up in an totally unbeliveable ending that takes up three pages.A real disappointment.
3,I would give 3 1/2 if it was here,"This is one of Ms. Grimes most frustrating books about her wonderful characters. Her characters are what makes reading her books almost an addicition. I'm a great fan of Melrose Plant and sometimes he almost supplants Jury in my affections - almost, but not quite. Ms. Grimes can delineate characters and set an almost dreamlike quality to her books like no one else. This book is more like this than some of her latest efforts. It seems to go slow, and it jumps around a lot with a lot of extraneous information, but it does all make sense in the end - to a point. This book is sad and sinister. It weaves a spell that sucks the reader in to thinking that this is another one of Ms. Grimes' ""cosies"". And then bang. It all becomes extremely real and deadly at the end. Without giving away the entire plot I would like to mention that I hope we haven't heard the last of Jury, Plant, Carole Ann, Mrs. Wasserman, Diane and Marshall."
2,What a disappointment.,"I was truly looking forward to another Richard Jury story, apparently Ms. Grimes was not. This book seems to be missing the other half. For one thing there were too many story lines that went nowhere, whereas there were several story lines that seemed rather imcomplete. Both the editor and the author should be ashamed about the number of discrepancies and inconsistancies. Moreover, the book just merely ended leaving me to ask ""what was she thinking?"""
2,The Blue Last,"Although I have always enjoyed the Richard Jury series with all the characters and plots, this book was a big disappointment. The plot wandered all over the place, with a side trip to Italy with Melrose and Trueblood which had nothing to do with the mystery. Also, the main mystery was never really explained or solved, characters you cared about were left in limbo, and the ending was absolutely awful, didn't make any sense at all."
2,The series quality is seriously deteriorating,"I've been reading (and until recently enjoying) Martha Grimes' Richard Jury series since shortly after ""The Man with a Load of Mischief"" came out. But the imagined scenes with philosophers debating and generally plodding writing--not to mention the innumerable typos--finally led me to skip the middle hundred or so pages of the book (I had gotten far enough in that I still wanted to know ""whodunnit""). And you know what? The book didn't suffer at all from the omission. I was quickly able to figure out what I'd missed and saved myself a couple hours of agony. After this I'm not sure I will continue with the series. (And really, she MUST stop with the internal monologues of dogs!)"
3,"Blue, at last","I was a fan of Martha Grimes, but gave up after her last few books, which I didn't enjoy. Since I do like the Richard Jury novels, I decide to give this one a try. The mystery was a good one, although the bit about Melrose and Trueblood traipsing through Italy had nothing to do with the main plot--just a diversion and change of pace, but I can't see the point. The ending is a true disappointment, and I found myself skimming through the book after reading the last page trying to see if I had missed something. I really hate it when the endings of books are ambiguous. Martha, please don't toy with us!"
3,Irritating,"I got to the end of this book and felt like I only had the first half of the book--where is the rest of the book? The part that ties things together? Other reviewers are right: The story doesn't hold together; subplots are left dangling; and the trip to Italy seems to be there simply for filler. Some of what Grimes does seems almost mean-spirited. For example, after building up the reader's interest in the mystery of Gemma's origins--and building up compassion for such a sturdy little girl--the book simply leaves us still wondering. Who the heck is she? Will she be all right? Leaving us worried about Jury is also simply mean. (We assume he'll somehow be okay despite the horrible ending since he's a central player, but nonetheless, the ending was rotten.) In short, the book lacks a real ending--making it an unsatisfactory read. Grimes may think she's building up interest for her next book, but this is a cheesy way to do it."
2,The Blue Last,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I'm thinking that Ms. Grimes has become maniacally bored with her stock characters, as this one reads as though written under the influence of a controlled substance.Her descriptive writing can be incredibly, evocatively beautiful, and I will be looking for her poetry.As for mysteries, given a new set of characters, NOT to include too-too precious and supernaturally brilliant children, and adults who are constantly lighting up while imbibing fine wines, I would keep her on my favorite author list."
3,Middle of the Richard Jury Pack In Quality,"I've read about a dozen of the Richard Jury series by Martha Grimes. I'd place this about the middle of the pack. The proposition - unearthed body from a bombed-out WW2 pub may reveal an impersonation - is ingenious in its own way. Without giving anything away, this one relies on a least-suspected-villain type of plot, which was handled relatively well. Martha Grimes does rely too much on coincidences in her plots, but this is hardly the worst offender IMHO. I'd rate it OK for Grimes fans, but look elsewhere for your first Grimes book, i.e. The Man With A Load Of Mischief."
4,Great Book!,"I enjoyed The Blue Last very much. Mrs. Grimestook an entirely new approach with Richard Juryand those other wonderful, colorful charactersthat I have come to love as much as RichardJury and Melrose Plant. However, I was sodisappointed at the ending of the book. Please,Mrs. Grimes, don't let this wonderful series endhere. We must know what happens to Melrose andVivian, Trublood, and Agatha. I will keep readingyour Richard Jury mysteries over and over, waitinganxiously for the next one."
2,Good Idea that Doesn't Work,"Richard Jury digs in the pits of depression until he is about to kill off his loyal fans in Martha Grimes, THE BLUE LAST. I've long has a problem with Grimes's children character in the Jury series and other writings. One could have more admiration for an oracle. They are too precocious and stoic, most also do little to advance the story, except in this case a dog who does come in handy.If you are reading the entire series there is no reason to stop now. Ms. Grimes still slings out marvelous characters with complex motives in the adult relm.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
2,Too bad,"My third and probably last Richard Jury book. I have to say I like the characters and feel comfortable with them but as usual the plot starts out so interesting and ends so disappointingly. A bit of an historical mystery from WWII and a lot of deep introspection by Jury where we learn a bit about his childhood. Though nothing can save the tortuous plot and although the ending was billed ""a cliffhanger"" I think I'd call it more of a dud."
3,I think that it may be time for a new series.,"I find myself tending to agree with the reviewers who had the feeling that _The Blue Last_ was two books melded together. The best bit about the Richard Jury novels has always been the combination of charming and affecting. Jury himself (in the best of the books) stands apart from the other zany folks, but not *so* far above. In _The Blue Last_, while Jury is actually getting more interesting (not a mean feat in his 17th novel) the Long Piddlingtons are dangerously close to self-parody.Suggest that Grimes may take the feeling that she is getting with Jury and the plot in this novel and create a whole new character/series."
1,Italian lessons,"While I found this book to be marginally entertaining, I found the Italian element shamefully substandard. Any basic Italian grammar, or even travel book, would note that the title ""signore"" loses the final ""e"" when used before a proper noun! ""Signore"" with the final ""e"" is used only when the word stands alone, as in ""Sir."" Also, the area south of the Arno River is referred to as ""Oltrarno,"" not ""Oltrano."" Unbelievably lax research or editing.And why have Melrose and Trueblood continually traipse around the continent? That angle is tired out! It adds nothing to the plot.Grimes is at her best with animals. She's the best there--unbeatable!"
2,"A letdown after ""Jerusalem Inn""","My escape from the horror of 9/11 was turning each night to ""Jerusalem Inn,"" which begins so evocatively and envelopes the reader in the more confident, less scandal-ridden, less Americanized England of 20 years ago. Once finished, I immediately bought ""The Blue Last."" It's still a fairly comfortable escape -- and topical too, dealing as it does with the London blitz -- but the motivations for Richard Jury's latest investigation, along with the Melrose Plant subplot, are such non-starters that one impatiently begins to wonder whether the principals simply have too much idle time on their hands."
3,Surprised and disappointed,"I've always liked the Richard Jury novels and am always looking forward to the next one. I did like The Blue Last but found the ending to be extremely frustrating and maddening. I didn't feel there was real resolution, is he or isn't he? So we are left to wait and see if this is really it! Please don't let it be, the series has been too entertaining and worth looking forward to!"
1,No Substance,"The presenters' methodology is to follow the analyst & their recommendations, which is fine, yet he did not give details as to which analyst to follow & there were no true details of how to use the analyst data. I believe that the owner of the DVD should place the word, ""SEMINAR"" on the front & back of the DVD case. The reasoning is that the DVD is a video of a seminar that was held in a hotel conference room. The powerpoint slides should have been presented in a better format because the video screen is being videoed & the powerpoint slides cannot be read properly. I expected a detailed educational DVD, so that I could use the standards for discovering hot stocks in the market, yet I was disappointed."
2,Awesome Sound; Pitiful Ergonomics,"Before purchasing these I had read other reviews with a similar message, and figured my ears could surely sacrifice a bit of comfort for some economically priced accoustics. I was wrong. I can't explain exactly why, but these things are QUITE uncomfortable. Perhaps more padding on the ears would help, or less pressure applied by the adjoining headband. Who knows... Seriously consider another set... Currently I can only wear these for about 10-20 minutes at a time before it becomes so uncomfortable that I have to take a break. I have a nagging suspicion that they're actually cutting off some circulation to my upper neck. Definitely considering returning them for this reason alone."
2,Poor Construction,"The ear cushions didn't bother me, I actually found these headphones relatively comfortable. However, after daily use for only 8 months, the adjustable plastic portion of the headphones snapped off when removing them from my head. That's just poor material choice. I'm glad I didn't spend much on these."
3,Pretty good,"Pretty good pair of headphones, sound quality was great, comfortable, clear. Decent job of blocking out noise, but the plastic piece that holds the ear piece to the headphone snapped off as I was taking them off. I'd owned them only for about a year."
1,Shocked,I started to read this book thinking it was going to be as good as the first. I was shocked how racist this author is. As a WHITE woman I take offense to this book. I will not be reading anymore books by this author.
4,A fascinating look at 25 years of reading research from Stanovich's work,"In case you didn't read the summary, Progress in Understanding Reading is a collection of significant articles from 25 years of research on reading by Keith Stanovich, interspersed with Stanovich's insights and reflective commentary. The chapters themselves cover a good range of topics, and appropriately highlight some of Stanovich's most impactful and enduring work, e.g. the interactive-compensatory model, which suggests poor readers use contextual information to compensate for weaknesses in decoding or textbase formation. The book concludes with a strong critique of the Reading Wars, specific disappointment in the political left (though Stanovich is outspokenly progressive, and takes potshots at conservatives) for blindly favoring whole language, and an argument for science-based approaches in the future."
2,"Works, but disappointed","We have had this unit for about a year now. It does work and it has saved us from driving in on a few occasions. I would have given it 5 stars if the graphic user interface would have been designed better. The device allows you to label each outlet to describe what is plugged into it, but the label doesn't display on the screen that power cycles the device. You have to open one screen to see which outlet number the device is plugged into, and then go to another screen to powercycle the outlet number. If they would have displayed the description label next to the power cycle button on the same screen, the unit would have been much easier to use and you would be far less likely to accidently tranpose a number between screens and power cycle the wrong device."
4,Decent PDU,"Decent PDU, does as advertised. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the web GUI was very antiquated (though still functional)."
5,Minimal at its very best.,"If you like deep minimal, laid-back house, this is as good as it gets. I don't know what else to say. I can listen to this while I write, get stuff done, etc. I love it. It's fantastic."
4,mix of harcore and power-metal,"Buy this album! Though things start off a bit weak, after a couple tracks, this band shreds. Case in point, who would have thought ""Oral B"" could prove such a worthwhile and heavy topic? :-) Planet Hate mixes different styles, with a metal and hardcore predominance. So, does this band have any other albums? Let's hope so. ""Break out the Oral B!"""
3,A1 Cardone 302809 Distributor,"I hope every one knows that this is a Reconditioned part and it should be price as a reconditioned part, Note: This is not a new Distributor"" ( the price is a little to high, the price should be more like $45.00 to $50.00 dollars )"
4,Identified Correctly; Worked Fine,This was exactly as described and worked and continues to work fine. Never have a problem with Viking mem.
2,Average all-in-one projector,"I have had the projector for 6 months now.Pros:- All-in-one, Video, sound, DVD player.- Comes with bag to carry around- Perfect for small screens in DARK environment.Cons:- DVD that you burnt yourself for backup (with recompression) don't play well. Even movies with low re-compression have problems, which shows by broken portions of some frames.- The worst through is the sound problem with self-burnt DVDs. Sometimes, even on low recompression DVDs, the sound is 1 to 2 seconds early. Which makes it a nightmare to watch those movies.- Image quality is average. If you place the projector more than 10ft away from the screen, then the image is not as bright.- The projector generates quite some noise, which the sound of the movie may generally cover, but not always.- VGA input didn't work with my Powerbook G4, even though the powerbook actually recognized the projector as well as its native definition.In general, i'm on the average for this projector. 2.5/5 would be my rating."
1,Should last just long enough for the warranty to expire,"This projector worked well enough connected to a home theater system, but not good enough on it's own. Speaker sounds awful, and the DVD player is so-so. However, after owning one for just over 2 years, I made the mistake of unplugging it to dust the table it was placed on, and when I plugged it back in, the Lamp and Temp LED's began to flash and the unit won't power on. There were no symptoms leading up to this, we used it not 12 hours earlier with no indications of any issues. I called Optoma tech support, and they didn't even want to hear the problem, they wanted me to ship it to them for repair. I checked online sources, and the symptoms seem to indicate the Temperature Control Sensor has failed, and of course, you can't find the part anywhere to replace it yourself. Imagine that, a two-year-old electronic device that fails when you plug it back in. Absolutely disposable, I will never buy another Optoma product."
1,Disposable Machine!,This is a great machine...there is just one problem. It is disposable!!!! We bought one and before long the discs would not load right away. Then some of the discs would not load at all. Then it would shut down after an hour and so forth until we sent it back and got another. The same thing happened to the second...and the third!!!! Don't waste your time with this one. The Epson Movie Mate 72 is superior.
1,"VERY UNRELIABLE don't buy, you will regret it","The unit is very finicky. It plays OK the DVDs, but has hard time detecting the connection to the computer.It breaks down, I had to send for replacement 2 times. Now it is out of warranty and it broke down again. The want me to pay $110 just to look at it. They charge $100/hour for their labor and parts are not cheap (e.g. lamp cost over $300).My recommendation: Stay away from Optoma.I think a big screen TV / monitor, is much better. You don't need screen, you can watch it with ambient light, much more reliable."
3,pretty good for starters,"this is a good starter projector. good for movie nights or anything in the dark but if you want to watch in the daytime, forget it. it not very bright. you gotta love the built in dvd player tho. one problem i have had with this unit is that when you use the remote to shut of the unit you have to push the power button and then it will ask you if you want to power off the unit then you have to push it again and the screen turns off, but two times now i have walked away on that and came back later to find that the thing is still on, sitting there for hours running burning up my lamp, i was very mad.all in all i am pretty happy with it. it's my first projector and it's great to have a huge screen. i'll keep this for a while and probly upgrade to a brighter one later so i can watch in the daytime without putting sheets over the windows."
1,This thing is a joke...,"I bought this projector about a week ago. Two days into using it, the ""lamp indicator light"" comes on and the projector shuts off. It'll come back on a few minutes later...only to die again. I contacted Optoma about this situation and was informed that I need to ship the entire unit back to them at MY COST in order to receive a replacement lamp. That means I have to wait for it to get there, wait for them to replace the lamp, wait for it to arrive back. After spending $1500 on this thing I think I should receive a bit better service.Don't think you'll be spared the same treatment, either. Even if you receive one without a faulty lamp...the life of the bulb is only about 70 hours or something. When yours goes out, you'll have to ship it back in for replacement too. I definitely regret my purchase."
1,If you're use to HD or looking for HD try something else,"-I bought the DV10 recently as a supplement to my current setup - Phillips 42 HDTV and the OPPO upconverting DVD player, The DV10 did not perform as well as I had anticipated and I quickly noticed the difference in image quality. Both the DVD and HDTV display performance for the DV10 paled in comparison to the Phillips and OPPO setup.-See the DV10 outputs at 480p whereas my Phillips is 720p/1080i ---huge difference! The HD content was a huge reduction in image quality to what I'm used to and the DVD video output was pathetic compared to the superior OPPO DVD player.-I guess it's ok as a niche product. However, if you're used to true HDTV and have experienced the visional joys of an upconverting DVD player, then I strongly recommend not buying this product. Luckily, I was able to return the product for a full refund. Also, be weary of the lamp replacement cost."
5,Spectacular!,"I did lots and lots of research of projectors before decided to buy this one and I could not be more pleased. I set this up in my room and projected it on a white wall and it looks amazing. Do not waste your money buying a $2000 flatscreen TV when this projector is at such a cheap price. The speakers on this are decent but if you're looking for surround sound then you deffinately need to buy speakers. The overall picture is amazing, you will not be disappointed with this projector!"
3,Film: 5 stars; DVD: 1 star,"This is a fabulous film, one of my all-time favorites: a funny, bittersweet, character-driven masterpiece of small-budget filmmaking, shot in a town I lived in for five years.Obviously, this was a cheaply done DVD release by Fox of a film that deserves a deluxe special edition. Besides the lack of extras, interviews, and audio commentary, I could not believe the poor sound quality of the DVD digital transfer: street scenes, crowd scenes, etc. sounded like they were recorded in a digital bucket! We had to turn down the sound during the pivotal Little 500 scene, because the digital garbage was so annoying.Having seen this many times on tape, I know that the sound of this low-budget film was not always good, but it was never horrible until this cheap digital mastering. Fortunately it does not completely ruin the experience of this wonderful film, but I wouldn't be in any hurry to replace a VHS tape with this DVD!Fox, fix your mistake and treat this film properly!"
4,Breaking Away,"The movie is everything I remembered. Characters you really like and wish the very best for them. It has humor, beautiful Indiana senery,I.U. traditions, love and most importantly honor."
4,I was there for the filming,"I was a student at I.U. in the Fall of 1978 and actually saw the movie makers filming this movie. I've owned this movie for several years and enjoy it each time I watch it. It's very nostalgic for me to see the landmarks on the campus and Bloomington, Indiana. After the movie was released, all of my friends and family that were from Bloomington had never heard of the term ""cutters."" It was a mystery to the locals. Also, after the movie was released the limestone quarries in the area were inhabited by college students, something the locals despised. A great movie, very wholesome."
4,Enjoyable,The video quality was not as good as expected but otherwise the movie was very enjoyable. I had seen this movie about 5 years ago but still enjoyed it.
5,Great film!,"This movie is one of my favorites, and the back-of-the-box description really doesn't do it justice. Yes, the main character is a cyclist, but that's not what the movie is about. It's about relationships, friends and family, and the awkward period of time after high school when you're legally an adult but still growing up."
5,"Great, great film!","An old favorite...loved it in the 70s; lover it now. Just a great, great movie about good friends and hope."
4,Moving and enjoyable. A mini-masterpiece!,I saw this movie after graduating from high school and it really hit home. These kids are out in the world and don't know what to do next. Well written and acted. Extremely entertaining and funny. A film that will always hold a special place in my heart.
4,More then a bike movie,"Bought this for the bike footage, but it is much more and really about coming of age and making those first big choices in life. A fun movie with a positive message"
5,You see I'm what you call a cutter,"Barbara Barrie asks, ""Aren't you glad to be alive?"", Paul Dooley answers, ""NO I'm glad I'm not dead, there's a difference."" I can't expect everyone to understand the complexity of this movie so let's say its a good movie to see once, its just like the movie 'Rudy' but slower. But for the minority of cutters like myself that have read lots of Mark Twain, Steinbeck, and Vonnegut - this is an American existential classic. Superficially, a coming of age movie with bicycles but on a literary level the movie is about how American society can convince middle-class youth of a false mythos and of how directed talent, a little ambition and a shot of self-confidence can transform; its about the joy of being young; and foremost it is about the existential becoming of the real person able to boldly move into the future by fully understanding oneself, (if any of my former Arizona St. U. classmates happens to read this review, don't laugh too hard!)."
5,Breaking away in a couple of ways,"Excellent movie: action/suspense, humor, and moral dilemma. Perfect demonstration of a kid trying to ""break from the tribe"" and of people learning to see past the imposed cultural stereotypes and portals, whether looking at themselves or others."
5,Great movie for everyone,"This movie is known as a bike movie, but it's really a movie about growing up and leaving home. It has funny dialogue, good acting and a good plot."
4,Back home in Indiana,"Having attended IU my Freshman year ('69/'70), I can attest that Breaking Away was certaingly not filmed on a Hollywood sound stage, but entirely in Bloomington, Indiana as the film's end credits proclaim. It is a delightful movie the whole family can enjoy. It is a relatively short movie with many funny moments (Paul Dooley is fantastic) and for me, reminiscent of my days at IU (the warm waters of the abandoned stone quarries, the beautiful IU library and the Little 500 race to name a few).Wonderful characters make the story extremely enjoyable. It's one of my favorite movies. ...LAP"
5,A Great One !!!!,I saw this film for the first time when I was 5 years old (because of my father's love to bicycles) and have seen it 50 more times during the last 20 years. A must-see for All !
4,Breaking Away - great fun for everyone,"An excellent film with really funny scenes of growing up in the 70's. For a Brit of 31 years I grew up on films like this so this is my view of the U.S., probably a little rose tinted, but I don't care.If you liked American Grafitti, E.T., Stand By Me, The Goonies, Etc you'll love this, and if you like cycling you'll really love it as it has some great stuff, a nice Masi bike and the 70's Cinzano team riding. Plus drafting behind the team lorry!Even my wife loved it and her eyes usually glaze over within 5 minutes of cycling films."
5,IU nostalgia,I attended IU and I very much enjoy watching this movie again and again. It was a well written screenplay and adapted well to a movie version.
5,This movie is why god invented humans...,"Simply put... Breaking Away is one of the best movies ever made.And is a tie with The Shawshank Redemption for most satisfying ending in a movie.A copy of this movie should be mailed to the home of every person in the country. Aw hell, Canada too."
5,Pretending to Be Someone Other Than Who You Are,"What I always found fascinating about ""Breaking Away"" was how it very gently dealt with the issue of unhappy people pretending to be something other than they are. Dave Stohler creates a whole new world for himself by pretending to be a charming Italian born exchange student, which in dark contrast to what he really is. He gets so into character he seduces a young female student and in the process the two fall in love. The most dramatic scene in the film is when Dave tells her the truth of who he really is. The most touching scene is when days later the two say goodbye. In this scene the girl, who appears over with her anger at Dave's deception tells him she is going to Europe for the summer. When Dave responds that he ""is not going anywhere"" .The girle responds back in a touching and gentle manner, "" I don't know about that."" Get this DVD."
3,enjoyable,"Decent movie with a young Dennis Quaid as well as a couple of other big names. The movie is a bit dated, but still enjoyable to watch."
4,An Exciting Comedy-Drama!,"This film has some nice insights on family ties and small-town life. A great crowd-pleaser that is never manipulative, and good character development and a fantastic screenplay make it a real audience-rouser. A superb cast give great performances but Paul Dooley is a stand-out as Dave's Father. Exciting bike sequences that are entertaining and funny at times, the excellent final race is superb and provides the perfect ending. It also has some romance and comedy mixed with some dramatic elements. Great attention to detail and quiet direction make this the sleeper hit of 1979. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
1,terribly dated teenage drivel,"Maybe this movie was better in the year of its realease (1979), but now it really shows its age. Both the story and the humor are clearly from the past, and the mannerisms of the major characters simply annoy rather than entertain. Rent this first, if you think its great... maybe you're dated too? If so, maybe it's YOU who needs to ""break away"" from the 1970s?"
3,Shameful treatment of a great movie,"This is a wonderful movie, probably in my all-time top 10. But the treatment for this DVD is shameful. For years, it was available only in full-screen format, which meant the sides of the picture were cut off so that there would be no letterboxing on old 4:3 television sets. That's bad enough.So now they've brought out the ""widescreen"" edition. Clearly, all they did was take the old full-screen release and blow it up, this time chopping off the top and bottom of the picture so that it now fits modern 16:9 TV sets.So by now the image, which was crappy to start with, has been blown up by a factor of about two, making it even crappier. You're probably seeing about the center 60% of the original image.The sound is also bad.20th Century Fox should be ashamed for kicking a classic like this to the curb."
5,Great!,"Okay, I am a teenager who only watched this movie because I was bored. But about ten mintutes into it I was laughing so hard! This movie has humour, romance, and great biking scenes. My Dad says every serious biker has watched this movie. But I think anybody looking for a great movie should definently watch this!"
4,Great movie,"A wonderful movie about growing up. If you've ever felt torn between sticking childhood friends and moving on with your life, you will definately appreciate this movie ... Plus it has some cool biking scenes in it too."
4,I can't get enough of this movie.,"I cannot say much about this movie because, if I did, I would run out of space. I love this movie, beginning to end. I would ask my health teacher if we could watch this movie in his class, and it came to a point where if I mentioned this movie again, I would get a detention. This movie deserves five stars, but I feel a movie has to be really great to get that rating. This movie reminds me of times in my own life. I guess that is why I love it so much. Get this movie and watch it immediately, you will not be dissappointed."
3,monkey bread,"I wanted this cookbook just for the Monkey Bread recipe; they're not really popovers, you know. I am a fairly experienced cook but I could not make them work. They came out heavy and flat--tasted okay but definitely not what I expected. Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?In any case, I put the book aside after being disappointed twice. After reading your reviews, maybe I better go back and give it another chance."
2,Beatuiful but recipes problems !,My wife is an accomplished cook. Like another reviewer from Va - She could not get the Monkey Bread and a few other Recipes to work. She only prepares food from 'scratch' and is very well versed in technique. The book is beautiful but!!!
4,Better than I thought,"First off, let me just say musical / dance themed shows are not my cup of tea. I bought this based on the great reviews it already got, and because Seo Ji Hye was in it.I'll admit, I almost didn't make it through the first few episodes. However, the more I watched, and the more an actual story line that weaved around the singing and dancing unfolded, and it was hard to stop watching it. The little moments of silliness and the seriousness of life lessons as they were learned was what kept me going. It was worth it.I do recommend this, even if it doesn't really sound like your cup of tea either: It gets better as the episodes go on."
3,What a surprise! (3.5 stars),"I picked this CD up because the price was good and I was surprised to find out it's one of the best albums I've heard in a long while. Maren's voice has a lot of range, although her voice can get annoying at times (her voice sounds like Michelle Branch sometimes.) Overall, though, this is one impressive album and I can't want to hear more from this talented Canadian singer/song-writer!"
3,A nice book,"Although this book is clearly not as complete nor as thorough as other encyclopedias on Witchcraft and Wicca, it is still an enjoyable book in its own right. Buckland's book is a good light reading for beginners that are currently unfamiliar with the topics he includes. The advantage for beginners is that Buckland does not go into much depth (which allows for easier reading) and greatly limits the amount of topics on the subject of Witchcraft/Wicca (which serves not to overwhelm the beginning reader)."
2,Half-Hearted at Best,"Maybe it's just me, but this book seems put together in a hasty and half-hearted attempt. Maybe the author had little time or something, I don't know. It just seems tossed together with little to really say in any real depth.The topics are far too brief and don't contain much real information (plus there are a lot of contradictions throughout the book). The biographies are very limited and it seems like the author only included a handful of people (friends only?).There are other and better Encyclopedias out there. Try Rosemary Guiley or Raven Grimassi if you want your money's worth."
3,Not the best witchcraft encyclopedia,"I've got a few other ""witchcraft encyclopedias,"" but I can't help comparing this one to Guiley's excellent ""Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca.""Both of them cover many of the same topics, but whereas that book goes into much detail, this one only gives a brief skim of them. It also gives too much focus for my taste to personalities in the witchcraft community today. I know Buckland is well-respected in this field, but I can't recommend this book unless it's going to someone who really needs a high, overview of the subject. There's too many better titles that are just as easy to digest while having a lot more rich detail. For those who aren't looking for an introduction I would recommend Guiley's book or Robbin's ""The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Encyclopedia."""
2,Don't really recommend,"I generally like Buckland's work but I don't really care for this one and was actually pretty disappointed. It's pretty superficial on most issues and promotes quite a few misunderstandings and generalizations. I found several areas that were just flat-out wrong. If you want something form the author, stick to his more practical works, they are generally top-notch."
3,It's okay,"I'm not saying this book is bad or that it's a great book to have. Honestly I got it for 5 dollars at a book sale so what I received was well worth the money. I wouldn't pay 20 dollars for it simply because the book is an encyclopedia, I feel it's a great book to have in your self if you need to look something up really quick but if you're looking for a book that you can learn about a subject this book isn't it. I think it's a nice start especially if you're just starting out with Wicca but it may or may not be beneficial to someone who's been doing this for years. Like I said, buy it cheaper. That's probably the best bet."
5,A new classic,"Authoritative, expansive, insightful and entertaining, Raymond Buckland has done it again. I expect that this volume will sit alongside ""Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft"" as an essential tome for those with serious interest in the subject. There is something here for everyone, from novice to old hand - and perhaps even for those curmudgeonly Buckland-bashers, though they'd never admit it ; ) Highly recommended."
4,An excellent resource book,"This is an encyclopedic work, meant to touch on a very many subjects, groups, and personages within the confines of a single volume work. There is a great wealth of information contained in this single volume. Raymond Buckland has been writing on the subject of Witchcraft for almost 50 years, and as a practicing Witch,is probably the single most knowledgeable author around. There is enough information here to whet anyone's whistle, and make the average reader want to explore in depth this fascinating modern religious practice and learn more about the who, what, when and whys of modern Paganism. As with all things Pagan, Buckland has his critics, but for the size and scope of this work, it is a must-have resource for both the newcomer and the more seasoned Pagan's library.-Pete Pathfinder Davis"
3,realllly noisey 60mm fan,"This UPS fits in 1U racks, so they had to compromise by making the one fan spin wayyyy too fast, so it's noisey and is on all the time. It's a Delta fan as well, so it's not known for being quiet fan brand.The power supply design is great otherwise: won't dump its load if the battery dies (unlike the APC SmartUPS), does double conversion so you're always running from a clean sine wave off the battery, has a USB port and there is even Linux support. You can finally replace the battery (a lot of other Tripplite's you can't replace the battery on) with inexpensive replacements. You can increase the backup power capacity by plugging in extra modules. Dang near perfect on my checklist except for the bloody loud fan.Don't get this if you plan to use it in your living room :-("
1,Don't BUY THIS OVERPRICED TERRIBLE PRODUCT,The mount made by Dension vibrates violently. This is not vibration from my car. I have a new Audi A4. I'mworried that my iPOD is going to break internally from all the motion. Would be better to just lay the i Podon my dash or above ashtray. One of the big selling points of this product involves the controls. You aresuppose to be able to control the iPOD with your stock Audi car stereo. But it only allows you to use 6playlists. Who in the world has only six playlists. What were these people thinking when they designed thisproduct!? Had no idea that this was the case until I purchased the product and had it installed. Do yourselfa favor. Buy an aftermarket car stereo that has a direct plug-in for the iPOD that you can control with theiPOD.
3,loose fit,"I like the material it is made of. It fit my DeWalt 744, but it is a loose fit. I think I will take another reviewers suggestion and wrap a turn or two of tape around it to make it snug. Otherwise it does what it's made for."
1,"This book is too simple, mostly words, no in-depth coverage",A big disappointment. I would like to see some coverage of the important fixed income pricing models instead of basic introduction. It is a waste of money. Maybe good for people who have no idea about fixed income AND know nothing about asset pricing. The author is an adjunct professor. Ajunct professors are usually people who have very superficial knowledge in the topic. Good books must be written by the good RESEARCHERS in the field.I decided to discard the book and choose a better one for my students.
5,Jeannie Kendall,"This is a sparkling wonderful album!! Jeannie Kendall's voice is just amazing! The guests are great, but let there be no mistake, this album is about Jeannie. No Bluegrass Lover should be without this collection of collaborations!! Jeannie's exquisite voice and performance make this album an instant classic!! The selection of songs includes two tracks that were recorded with her father, the late Royce Kendall of the famous Kendalls duo(""Heaven's Just A Sin Away,"" ""Thank God For The Radio,"" among other hits).The wonderful harmonies and melodies make this the ""Album of the Year"" for me. It is an 11+ on a scale of 10, a bases loaded HOMERUN in the bottom of the 9th!! Magnificent!!"
4,strong remake of a Patrick Swayze hit......,"When most people hear the name ""Patrick Swayze,"" they think DIRTY DANCING, right? Well, during Swayze's era as a 1980s heartthrob, he also penned a beautiful song, ""She's Like the Wind,"" that had considerable airplay on the radio and became a hit [his only hit]. The melody is gorgeous, the lyrics are stirring and when Patrick Swayze recorded it himself, it sounded quite sensual and seductive. How does this rehash, for 2007, compare to the first recording? I would say it sounds pretty good. Though, I don't really like Lumidee or her rapping, it actually sounds pretty good, here, and is well-complimented by Tony Sunshine's smooth vocals. Sunshine is better known for his collaborations with the Terror Squad. Personally, I think the guy could sing the phone book and I would love him."
3,"ok, he has had better before and after","Robert Kelly knows how to create an album and make a message as we have seen in his videos, songs, etc. This one has many sounds and styles and may be too much."
3,ST-05 BSR/ Fisher Type Replacement Stylus Review.,"for the record this ceramic replacement provides decent reproductivity on a lower -end turntable, but doesn't sound all that great on more -expensive equipment. i merely bought it for use as a 'tide- me- over' until i had more money for a superior one. as for its service life, it might last for several months before the projecting part that holds the tipped diamond needle breaks from the body, or the needle works partway through the holder or even come free and become lost. i wouldn't say that the holder had a small- enough hole through it to prevent this from happening unless one is really careful to never press down upon it at all.in a pinch it would suffice ,however."
4,diva times three,"affron's text is insightful; the frame enlargements are helpful and supportive of the text.the most interesting aspect of this book could be its only failing. by choosing to study gish's silent work, davis and bridging the two with garbo, who acted in both silent and sound film, there is not a clear reason why affron selected these three. nor is there a clear connection between the three. not to mention, davis' filmography was the most accessible, as well as the most diverse (yes, that can be argued but how many of gish's films actually survive to disprove what i'm saying?) and davis could warrant a book all her own.so, if it is of interest, read closely and draw your own conclusion. i will be doing it again very soon."
2,A Plot and Characters You Have Seen Before,"This is a very disappointing book. The plot was formulaic and the characters were under developed and unbelievable. Some of the decisions made by police officers, fbi agents, and museum directors would not have been made by a three year old. It's hard to take the plot seriously when it's driven by gross negligence and ignorance. It's just a disaster."
1,borrrring!!!,"Sorry, I couldn't even finish this book. It was ridiculous, slow and lacked any common sense. After a single murder, the museum should have been shut down."
4,A good monster tale,"This book has some really terrible science, particularly the genetics and evolutionary biology. The G.S.E. computer program which is central to the plot couldn't be written today let alone in 1995.That said, if one can suspend disbelief, this is a quite good monster story. Horrifically brutal deaths are occurring inside the museum. As clues mount showing the killer to be other than human, resistance to this idea builds among the museum's top officials and city politicians.The result is a page turner.The story continues in Reliquary."
5,A pleasant surprise,"I have only recently gotten internet service.I discovered how much I could save buying my books and dvds on line, but I avoided the books under $3.00.I finally decided to try a .02 book thinking that it was probably going to be really beat, but lo and behold,it was like new. The only thing wrong with it was a 1/4 inch tear and a very small bit of wrinkling at the top of the dust cover. I've gotten books with that much damage from my book club, and paid up to $25.00 for them. I will only be buying used books on line from now on."
1,Don't waste you money on this one,"I had read some of the reviews about this book and wish I had paid more attention to the one star reviews. This is one of those books that one can continue to read to see how much more predictable a book can become. It's not that the book is badly written; it's that the characters are flat, the plot ridiculous; and the ending becomes evident by the middle."
4,THIS NOVEL'S A KEEPER...,"This is an excellent read. My four-star rating is due to a slight confusion with so many characters in similar jobs at the museum (at least to me) and a bit of a heavy hand with the technical stuff. It also could have used a tad more romance.I was drawn the main characters - particularly Pendergast, Margo, Brock and Smithback. Though I relished the movie's version of D'Agusta. Penelope Ann Miller was perfect as Margo. Stronger in the movie, I felt. Having seen the movie many times and loved it, IMHO, comparing the book and movie enhanced the read - though there is a vast difference in the roles the characters play, and of course, the ending.I'll wait a few months and then read this book again. It's a keeper. And I will certainly search out more novels by Preston and Child."
4,Very Proper,"The mousy museam girl; the genius lethal albino FBI agent; the brilliant crippled professor; the ambitious young research fellow; the slovenly-but-smart NY cop. And the monster in the basement, of course.I got the sequel, too. :)"
4,"Great action, mediocre detail","This book had a lot of action and suspense the whole way through. The twist at the end was really surprising, and you couldn't have guessed it if you tried. Unfortunately, the it also leaves a lot of loose ends and confusing ""red herring"" subplots. I would not say it's any better than Crichton, but it's just as good in its own way."
5,Not to be missed!!!!,"Okay, so it's not exactly thought-provoking stuff, but I read this book ages ago and it's always stuck in my mind. It's swift and grusome and not to be missed by any horror-fans. Fast-paced and chilling with buckets of really cool characters--loved it."
3,A chiller that fails to chill.,"Relic starts out creepy and dark, and just might be interesting. But the more you read, the more you will lose interest until the last 150 pages. The climaxes and the surprise ending (Assuming you haven't seen the movie) are worth their weight in ink, but the rest of the book just doesn't hold up. I would recommend this book to people who are comming right out of the Young Adult section."
3,Too Gory,"I have read most of the other Pendergast Books. I decided to read the first book. Although I did like this book, It was a little gory in some places."
4,GOOD!,I am a strange person.I like to read the novel before I came towatch the movie in the cinema. It is exiciting to know before ithappens within my knowledge. This habit starts when I learn to read a novel. My first glance on the book shelf concerntrate on the horror site. Then the black-covered book captured me.I buy it and start reading it.What an amazing story!Asuspenceful novel that I spent two days to finish it. END
4,Relic has a Surprise Ending,"Forgot when I bought this one, I had already read it years ago. I remembered nothing about it as I read it, however, until the surprise ending, which was indeed memorable."
3,an all right book....for the most part,"This was a good read, but there were too many characters to keep straight. The book didn't cut to the chase, and was scientifically incorrect."
4,A very good read.,"1/1 Story:Quite far-fetched, but still a captivating premise.0/1 Characters:The only characters I felt were properly fleshed-out were Margo Green and Dr. Frock. D'Agosta and Agent Pendergast could have used some more work, although I'm sure more will be revealed as the series goes on.1/1 Readability:Nothing special, but good enough to keep me interested.1/1 Representation:The title is fitting and the jacket synopsis is interesting and accurate in relation to the story.1/1 OpinionI really enjoyed this book and would definitly reccommend it."
4,Out-Frigging -Standing!,"I felt as if I was actually in the jungle. I found myself looking into the subtleties of conversations in the book, trying to catch a glimpse of what might be happening later in the story, and I saw the movie first! I really recommend this read."
5,Relic: definitely a true thriller!,"I began to read Relic as a precursor to reading another title by the author, figuring that if Pendergast is an ongoing character in a series, that it would be worth going back to the beginning to see how the series started.It was definitely worth reading.This novel keeps you wondering what the next turn in the story will be, and, the ""good"" versus ""bad"" characters, definitely are played out in the ongoing suspense, and intrigue.The monster character is definitely a surprise. While the monster is indeed a horror, and a monster, a reader will also gain some empathy for Mbwun as its character develops, and the final reveal occurs.As for Pendergast: He's a quirky individual whose manner reminds me somewhat of Hercule Poirot, or perhaps a more contemporary comparison to Detective Goren (Law and Order: Criminal Intent).In any case, I'm reading the sequel to Relic, Reliquary, and so far, so good. I'll be back to comment on Reliquary too!(PS: I read Relic on my Kindle 2)"
4,Pure Awesomeness in its monstrous fury,"Fantastic monster/creature feature book with just enough scientific jargon to make it interesting but not too much to not bog the story down. It's about a monster (maybe prehistoric) that runs loose in the underbelly of the New York Natural History museum.Also, for those of you who might be interested, I read this book on the kindle app for the ipad and thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
5,Phenomenal!!,"Preston & Child's first is still their best work, a lovely re-read. Although I do anxiously await their next, following the fantastic Two Graves."
1,relic by douglas preston,I didn't care for it but I don't care for science fictions. It was too far out and impossible to believe.
4,Hey Good book,Well all I gotta say after just readinig Jurassic Park I thought I would be dissapointed with most other titles...I was so wrong This was a fun read with high action and a great plot..plus I loved the Epiloug
5,Wow.,"I was not familiar with the authors when I bought this book.Once I started it, though, I didn't want to put it down. Italmost made me scared of the dark! The beginning grabs yourattention and keeps it as the story builds. As a frequentmuseum-goer, I can attest to many of the details of thefascinating setting the Preston and Childs have created. Thetwist at the ends leaves a wonderful opening for another book!One thing is for sure, I'll never look at museums the same way,especially after dark . . ."
4,Pendergast's first,A very good read but lacks the development of Pendergast found in later books in the series. The premise stretches the imagination and might be even enter the science fiction realm a bit.
2,"Not the best, but somewhat entertaining","This book has a curious jeckle-hyde complex. The first half is great, being both thoughtful and creative. The second half turns the story into a run of the mill butcher-fest. Unfortunate. The authors did a great job setting the mood, then let all the suspense slip away in a highly predictable blood bath. Not hard to read and fun in parts. It could have been a meaningful work, but saddly ends up being the same old stuff."
3,A fast read!,"There is a major flaw in the book, namely, is the creature a missing link or is it manufactured through ingestion of an obscure plant. Other occurrences are not quite credible, but this is a fast, enjoyable read. It is certainly not on the level and sophistication of a Jurassic Park, but it will provide escape for a day or two."
3,"Interesting, but not great","The plot-line of this novel is interesting. Unfortunately, the writing style leaves something to be desired. With no character development to speak of, the reader starts to care more about the museam the story takes place in--desiring more descriptions of it--and not the characters themselves.As for the ""big secret"" of Mbwen, I personally had it figured out within the first couple of pages.On the whole, the book is worth reading once, but not more than that."
2,Reads like a movie...a bad one,"Relic is a simple, mindless story that probably appeals to those who like those books that are written after a successful movie. The dialogue is unsophisticated and the plot distasteful."
5,This will be a classic thriller.,"You gotta love a book who's premise is that every million years or so a quirk of evolution emerges to weed out the weaker (once dominant)species. You also have to love FBI Agent Pendergast, a genuinely different character, full of secrets as dark as those he endeavors to reveal during his gruesome assignments. He's a quirky James Bond, only cooler. Lots of tension in this book--among characters, among twists in the plot line, and in homo sapiens' place in the world.Heart pounding action....blood and gore...a great cast of characters, an original ""monster"", and dark scary places....what else could you want?"
5,What fun,"I started with Cabinet of Curiosities and needless to say, it peaked my curiosity, so I decided to go back and follow the books in order. P&C; write very taut, non-fat books. They keep the tension high in this one and never stray from the topic at hand. Of course, how can you not love Pendergast? He's the ultimate FBI agent, a walking encylopedia, calm, cool and collected.If you want an action thriller, some neat characters, a bit of tension and a book that is hard to put down, you can't go wrong with this one.Skip the movie though"
4,Great book!,"This was a great horror/suspense book. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. The ending is great! I've already started to read the sequel ""The Reliquary."""
5,One of my favorites,"I really am a fan of Preston and Child, I love the Pendergast novels. Relic is fantastic a must read for people who like mystery mixed with horror."
3,A little too predictable,"I'm afraid Relic was a little too predictable for me. This was my first time reading Douglas Preston so I had no idea what to expect of their writing skills. Sadly, for me, it fell short in the 'scare' department. Now, having said that ... I'm still giving Relic a solid three stars because I felt the authors did a good job with character development and, while I'm a bit jaded with this type of storyline, I was still eager to finish the book.It's rare that I will read only one book from a new-to-me author (after all, we each can have a bad day!) so I will definitely give Douglas Preston another chance to scare the bejeebers out of me."
1,In Relic the cliche drools all over itself,"This book has no redeeming value. The characters do not even rise to the level of stereotypes; they are poor copies of stereotypes. The science comes straight out of Merlin's medieval alchemy class. The plot ends around page 225 and then twists and twists and twists until one simply no longer cares to the most dragged out improbable of endings.If you are stranded on a desert island with only this book, use it for kindling before you read it."
2,Not a fan,It just honestly was not my kind of book. A little too harsh in some parts and a bit boring at other times.
3,Not enough Pendergast,"I probably would have enjoyed this more if I hadn't already read Book of the Dead, which is basically Relic re-visited with a Diogenes twist. And we learn much more about the Pendergast brothers in Book of the Dead as well. Relic seems like a warm-up for the rest of the series, lots of museum information, not enough characterization."
4,Excellent way to escape,"I loved this book. Wonderful setting and all of the anthropology and science deepened the book beyond your typical ""thriller."""
5,Worth reading again,"If you are expecting an indepth analysis of this book, read someone else's comments. I just know whether a book is worth the read or not.Every couple of years I reread this book. NO hidden agenda, no moral messages. Just good and exciting fun. Once you start reading, it is very hard to stop. If you haven't read this book, you're really missing out on a good time."
4,Relic,"This is a really interesting and suspenseful series. I didn't read them in the proper order, so I started from the beginning and I'm delighted."
4,Better than the movie.,"Hey, I LIKE the movieThe Relic(Yikes - those special effects do not hold up!), but the book is much better.The quote on the cover says that this book is ""Far above Crichton's Jurassic Park"". Now, of course that's crazy nonsense, but there are similarities between how Crichton writes a thriller and this story. Namely, the plot unfolds at a good clip, and is interesting and suspenseful enough that I always roll right into the next chapter. Also thought the end was great, if I had book 2 handy, I would already be halfway through it. A great start to the series!"
3,Page-turner with B-movie plot,"I enjoyed reading Relic on the beach in Mexico. It was a fun read, but I doubt that I'll remember it 10 or even 5 years from now like I remember other novels by science-fiction/thriller writers, like Michael Crichton et al.Agent Pendergast and other characters were very colorful but shallow. The antagonists were one-dimensional, some plotlines went nowhere, suspense was rooted in gore, and I took away no cautionary lessons.However, I have to admit that I kept reading because the story moved along quite quickly and I wanted to find out what happened. I couldn't help thinking, though, that if this were made into a movie, it would be a bad one."
5,One of seven masterpieces by Preston and child,"This is the two author's first novel together; they have written seven total with a eighth due out next year. The imagination, thoughts, and ideas that went into this novel is mindboggling. I have several favorite authors I read, but I have to say Douglas J. Preston and Lincoln Child are hands down the best. If you've see the movie and haven't read the book you will be kicking yourself for wasting time with that waste of film, the movie does the book no justice. For example I read the book first and found out there was a movie, I think I watched maybe 10 minutes and turned it off it was disgusting. The sequel Reliquary might even be better it's hard to say. Both books were brilliantly written. Once I read the Relic, I had to find the other books the authors had written together. In my opinion Douglas J. Preston and Lincoln Child are top of the class. But hey don't take my word for it read for your self and you too will be hooked."
3,An interesting listen,"I found the story itself rather rivetting. However, the recording was not that great of quality. I could often hear where things were ""cut out"". since this was the abridged version. I did find that to be rather annoying. I think I'd have enjoyed it better if I'd gotten the unabridged version."
2,ok 2 1/2 stars,"read only if desparate. im giving it more than 1 star purely due to the chapter 63, or the epilogue if you must. i found that the book dragged on too much and was relieved when i finally finished it [i would have stopped reading if i could but i just cant not finish a book]. the ending sort of made the whole ordeal worth while - i actually gasped and almost dropped my coffee when i read it. if you cant be bothered reading the whole goddamn book just read chapters 1, 3, 4, 14, 62 and 63. i lost interest often and found myself having to read the same sentence/page over and over sometimes because it wasnt catching if you know what i mean. just bored me and made me anxious to finish it. the characters didnt really do anything for me either. maybe if it were written by different people/person, it may be worthwhile but do yourself a favour and read something else. i suggest the da vinci code or deception point, both by dan brown. hope i helped you."
1,Alien meets Jurassic Park in The Poseidon Adventure,"This made-for-TV book has no redeeming value. It might give you a thrill if you're unfamiliar with manipulative cliches. The pacing is relentless, of course; it's a good device to keep readers from noticing the poorly-thought-out plot. The characters seem to come from a standard list for horror/disaster flicks, modified somewhat for political correctness. And there are so many characters, none are developed beyond that first stereotype. My only pleasure was guessing which of these cardboard cutouts would be dead before the end of the book.. Unfortunately, some of the characters survive -- the ""epilogue"" is apparently the start of a sequel. The horror, the horror"
1,Garbage and pseudo-scientific gobbledly-gook,"I decided that I would finish this book, even though I knew at about the half-way point, I would have to dispose of it so that at least there would be one fewer copy on the face of the earth when I was done. The plot is non-existent, the characters completely unbelievable, either mind-boggingly stupid, or geniuses of the first order. The science is so weak as to be embarassing. More than embarassing, absolute garbage, even taking into account poetic license. To anyone who believes that you can sequence an entire genome overnight, I can recommend a few good books on biology. The authors could also benefit from reading these books. To anyone who believes that this is a quality novel, or anything beyond toilet-paper, all I can say is ""There are good scientific thrillers out there, these authors couldn't write one, even if they were copying one word-for-word."""
1,This book is just plain bad,"I'm forced into my first review...Yes, I read all the way through it. I bought it on the recommendation of a bookstore (Borders) employee. I said to myself ""Hmmmm. New York Times Bestseller..How can I go wrong?"". Apparently, the collabrative authors have done quite well with their series of....I don't know. I could only finish this book because I am compelled to finish any book that I begin to read.I am having great difficulty understanding how this could ever be a NY Times bestseller let alone Amazon reviews of over 200 rating this as 5 star.I would not take the time to write this review for something trivial, but I'm very annoyed that I wasted my time to read a sub-par B movie. All cookie cutter characters and dialogue from old movies of the 1930's or a bit later. This was written in 1995. C'mon.I was actually angry to read this to the end.Anyone who enjoyed this stupid and laughable novel is welcome to defend. How could you?"
4,Standard Thriller...with Thought,"Combine Die Hard and Jurassic Park and you get an idea of what you're in for with Relic. Relic reads like a feature film and its nothing if not fun. Sure, the action is somewhat predictable and the characters are a little shallow but this is pure entertainment. Unlike other novels in the genre, however, Relic is well plotted and researched. This is a must for your list of summer reading."
4,Surprisingly great,Even though I'm a huge Preston and Child fan I was hesitant to pick this book up only because I'd seen the movie and thought it to be rather cheesy. The novel is slightly different and offers much more detail and suspense. I was pleasently surprised. Not their best effort but overall a very good read.
5,A good techno-thriller,"When two young boys are found murdered and horribly mutilated in New York City's American Museum of Natural History, the New York City police soon find themselves joined by an FBI Special Agent from New Orleans, Aloysius Pendergast. There is something strange going on here, as none of the clues seem to make sense. Are they dealing with a deranged serial killer or a wild animal? The answer may be much worse than they ever figured!Overall I found this to be a very good book. It's a good techno-thriller, with a nice, frightening killer. The feeling of dread is well maintained throughout the story, and I must say that I liked the character.This is a very good book, and a nice kick-off to the series. Now I just hope that the next book is as good as this one!"
4,Craft Notebook,"It seems like a very good craft book, and I'll find a use for it, but I only rated it 4 stars because I'm not going to be able to use it for the reason I bought it. Probably my own misunderstanding, but by the description it seemed like there would be more room in the notebook zippered sleeves which was what I needed."
3,Didn't Miss Cindy,"I didn't miss Cindy at all! I know she just left out of no where and I was wondering where in the world she went off to! I think Cindy is a snob! I didn't like reading about her for two whole books and I hope those are the last books about Cindy, but I don't want her to disappear again. I hated when I didn't know where people were. *When Sammy and Tor were in Ireland, it took them forver to mention that and when Cindy disappeared it took them about ten or more books to let us know!* I really don't like Cindy, but I hate it when characters disappear and I wish the horses would come back! I miss them! Pride rocked, but know he's gone! :("
3,Too many unanswered questions.,I have been reading this series since it first started. i also read the ashleighs series too. Anyways i have read all of the books in the thoroughbred series in fact i own all of them. i also have been reading some of the reviews and i agree with alot of them. this series has gone dramatically different. There are way to many questions that need answers and you fans out there know what i mean. the writers need to come out with at least 4 more super specials to explain what happened to alot of the other characters and horses. Thank you
4,It was ok,"I did like how this book filled in the gaps, but I don't like Cindy. I always thoought she was a very selfish and snotty person. You think being an orphan, she'd be a little more greatful. And I believe what the book ment was Jazzman was bred to be a jumper, but proved to be a better racehorse. I think this book was good, in that it filled in the gap in the time period and I would recomend it to other TB fans!"
4,Good! (Not The BEST but... ),"This book (along with #47) answers a lot of questions. I'm SOOOO happy to find out what happend to Champion (He is my favorite)!! Even though Cindy is my least favorite(Except for Brad and all ""the others"")the book was intresting and a little more realistic than some of the others. I'll be glad when the focus goes back to Christina and her pals though. Love the TB books, keep it up =)"
3,"No ""Gimme Hope, Jo'anna"" on here!","Since no album tracks were listed on Amazon, I unfortuately went by M. Donnavon's review here...neither of the songs listed by him are on ""File Under Rock"" (check out the review on allmusic.com for more track info, which I should have done before ordering this). Otherwise, not a bad album; reggae tinged ""arena rock"" that would fit in with Journey or Foreigner, even a little Pablo Cruise. Included is a remake of his 1968 ""Baby Come Back"" hit with The Equals (ok remake, but the original has a lot more bottom end to it)."
3,A review of other's work,"This book is divided into several sections: Reincarnation, Out of Body Experiences, Apparations of the Dead, and a few others. In each section, the author provides some leading cases (although not enough NEW cases) and research of others as evidence for something existing. Then he presents the critics arguments, and he attempts to review both sides of the case.One thing that I found disappointing about the book is that the author has done zero research on his own. He has read widely on the subjects at hand, but the book is essentially his opinion of the arguments. He trys to use logical arguments to destroy the critics position, and for the most part, he succeeds. It seems he was more critical of the critics than of the researchers such as Ian Stevenson to the point I question his impartiality on the subject.The book has value in that he provides the user with a wide range of arguments against the various claims."
4,Wordy but readable,"Frankly, it was the death of my parents last year that facilitated my interest in reading about anything that provided evidence of life after death. Although a bit wordy, this text presented the most thoughtful and educated material I have read about the subject so far."
2,where's the tailgate,Funny that Villanova would license a tailgater mat when they don't allow tailgaiting.
2,A well written book spoiled by awful photographs,"I found the information in this book interesting and well thought out. I've read more in depth analysis of Pompeii by Mary Beard. The let down for this book is that the photographs are terrible. The photographs look underexposed and many lack decent composition. The photographs truly let the book down. The reason I am giving it only 2 stars is that in spite of the writing, the book is presented as a (fairly pricey) image oriented hardcover. It fails as being a book that presents the imagery well and feels far less expensive than the price for what is in it. If it were a less expensive book presented more for the informational content, I would rate it higher. There are better books if you are interested in images of Pompeii."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT VERY GOOD,The ideas presented in this book are things a high school student would know and the writing is poor. Buy this book if you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about PR. If you know even a little bit then you know what this book is going to say.
1,Disappointed,"This book is certainly not for everybody. The author admits to being a relative neophyte to the Internet and it shows. If you have any familiarity with the Internet or maintain a web site, reading the summation at the end of the chapters will be more than sufficient. Suggestions such as ""Value is necessary to a website. Offer visitors something they can use."" is common sense. Who would think of creating a web site having no value and is useless to their visitors? There are books available which do a much better job of addressing web site construction and a majority of the information provided on how to launch a web-based P.R. campaign is intuitive. This book was a major disappointment."
1,Feo Y Estúpido: El Cuento de Michael Levine.,"Sus características de extranjero aparte, este hombre es feo a causa de sus ojos pequeños pequeños y brillantes que acaban de deslumbrar directo. Y discurso acerca de estúpido, todo usted tiene que hacer es leído este libro para ver Levine que cuán mudo es. El roba cada idea de alguien más."
1,I liked my textbook better,I am also a student at BU and personally I found our textbook to be a little more helpful. Maybe that's why I am getting a B+ in our class and doofus boy below is getting a C. Ha ha!I doubt very much that the author of this book could even pass a college course with as little as he knows about the business side of PR. I don't think this book was written with any target audience in mind because it just kind of jumps all over the place. Maybe its good reading for schizos. Or people with ADD.
4,One heck of a book!,"It's about time Michael came out with a new one! Well done.Lots of fun and great information. Check out the ""original"" guerrilla book by Jay Conrad Levinson- Guerrilla Marketing for Writers andGuerrilla Publicity"" It will be a good addition to this book."
1,Unhelpful For Students,"Wow, if this book is better than the textbooks they use in Boston then thank God I don't go to school there. I'll admit I haven't read this book, but based on the simplicity of Guerrilla PR I feel skipping this one is a good choice. I'm not sure I can think of anybody that would benefit from Levine's books. If you don't already have all the basic knowledge of PR that Levine covers in his books, then you have no interest in PR and this would bore you to death. The only amusement you can get from this book is noticing all the times it completely contradicts what all the professors are now teaching."
5,Guerrilla PR is a good book!,"For those of you who had negative things to say about Guerrilla PR, I want you to write your own book that clearly explains what you thought this book wasn't saying. The fact that you took the time to even read the doggone book lets me know that there was some interest to you. If you can come up with something better, let me know when it hits the top sellers list!"
3,We Found The Cat ... Now Where Is The Rest?,"I found this book to be written well, easy to read, but hard to get into. Figuring out where the book is taking you, besides a description of relativity and quantum behaviors, was hard. I found the over all book to be interesting, if you were to not know anything about relativity, but having studied it ... well I would have thought that a bit of humor or something was in order. Great for the non-physicist out there."
3,"A little old, focused on transactional (Cramer's) interpretation of Quantum Mechanics","This books claims that Transactional's (or Cramer's) interpretation of quantum mechanics has solved all the mysteries of the theory. I'm not sure that the author would hold the same opinion ten years after that (the book is dated 1996).In fact, there is growing consensus today that the right interpretation is so called ""decoherence"". For a comparison of interpretations, look for Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics in WikipediaAnyway, as is always the case with Gribbin's books, reading is insightful. The travel is worth the reading, although the final conclusion may be wrong. Only the final chapter (even only part of it) is devoted to explain Cramer's interpretation.John, we'd very much like to have another book like this, but devoted to the ""decoherence"" approach!"
3,An Adequate Primer For Quantum Physics and Its Mysteries,"This book does a great job of describing the principles of quantum mechanics and problems introduced by its notions. Gribbin does a great job of building a mystery of what may be possible (i.e. the unified field theory, a.k.a. the theory of everything). However, the book comes short of delivering upon its promise. Gribbin and the editor basically rifle through proposed theories and solutions of various physicists and ultimately say regarding these theories ""I kind of like it"" or ""I don't like it."" There is no in-depth probing of the theories, but glib judgments. The book, in those sections, has an unpleasant effect of reading like a transcript of a dilettante grad student running his mouth in a campus cafe. There are better written, and more elegantly explored books than this book. Kaku's books deserve a special mention, and for its simplicity, Hawkings' ""Black Holes and Baby Universes""."
2,"Good historical background, but a hazy view of quantum.","Gribbin's book is strong in introduction, but seems tofall short in properly addressing theissues of the quantum theory itself. The introduction is extremely good: one is drawn into important historical advances in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of light. Unfortunately, the transition to quantum theory is quite abrupt, and the author does not make good use of this material. It seems that the historical study of light was written almost independently of the section addressed to quantum mechanics. One is left with a hazy conception of Quantum Theory."
4,It was a good layman's book.,"The book by John Gribbin, ""Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality"", was a good layman's book. However it does deserve some constructive criticism.I felt that the book failed to make proper transitions between concepts. Like going from relativity to quantum mechanics. Why did the physics community have such a revolution ?Also I felt that the quantum mechanics section was less then completely comprehensive, in that it gave a brief description of it. Like I might of expected out of such a short book.Despite all these things I still think that the book did represent a good book for laymen to better understand the world of physics."
5,Brilliant!,"This book presents a very lucid, engaging, andoften humorous explanation of the oddities ofquantum physics. It's a wonderfulintroducion for the curious, the neophytephysicist or the experienced metaphysician!"
2,It wasn't what we expected,Our 7 yr old daughter was given this last Christmas. It is awkward to use and the motor didn't seem to have the power needed to turn the wheel when the clay was on it. She ended up using the clay and molding it by free hand. It now sits in the corner of her activity table and isn't used at all.
3,IMPORTANT TITLES MISSING,"Otis Williams & His Charms had a great sound and the 30 trackson this CD are good in general but only 4 of them are amongtheir charted hits. Conspicuously missing are: Ling Ting Tong,Bazoom, Ivory Tower, Little Turtle Dove and Panic. I feel thatexcluding these 5 titles is inexcusable and the reference of the""Best Of"" category is not justified on this CD because of theirexclusion. Shame on King Tee (CD producer).I recommend that you check out the CD:""Ivory Tower --- The Very Best Of Otis Williams And His Charms""for a better selection of their terrific music."
2,Fair CD,Sound quality is not too good and the CD does not contain many of his original songs from the old LPs.
2,"Audio CD review: Banal insights, stilted narration of main character","I had never ready this author, but I found this at my local library, liked the cover, and wanted to read about some middle aged angst. I found the first couple of CDs promising, if a tad long winded. Unfortunately, I felt the book lost steam. I also had a problem with the narration. Overall, I thought the reader did a great job with just about everyone but the main character. Unfortunately, I found her narration of the main character to be very stilted, and nearly expressionless, sounding very prim almost. Maybe that's actually the author's fault rather than the reader's--I don't know. Having only heard the CDs, I can just tell you how the main character comes across when one listens. I found the book to have fairly banal conclusions and insights about middle age and mid life crisis, and many of the speeches of the characters in the last cds seemed a little too convenient and obvious."
2,Flawed,"I said I wasn't going to do it this year, but I did it anyway: I read, cover to cover, a seriously flawed book. Every plot point, every character, every setting, screamed cliche, cliche, cliche. Yet I kept reading. Why? I never do this. All I can figure is it was the main character's midlife struggles and the family's African American-ness that kept me tuned in to the last page. The truth is that the whole book was really a bad fictionalized version of Dr. Phil-like advice about menopause and male midlife crisis."
3,Good book - disappointing conclusion,"Loved the book. I could not put it down but the last quarter seemed rushed and the ending was a let down. After all the women went through, ultimately, Morrison did not let them change. Same old same old. The first 3/4's was vibrant and the last part the characters seemed to either settle or disappear. Nothing was really resolved and it feels like they'll be back 10 years from now trying to fix what they should have done in this book. Maybe that's the point. I'd like a sequel that has them really resolve the issues."
3,The Interruption of Everything,"I belong to a book club and this was the chosen book for the month. I really enjoyed the fact that I am able to get my books as fast as I can through Amazon. I am trying to encourage the other memebers to use it, but they are afraid of putting their credit card on line.The book was a slow start because the person was introducing you to all the characters. But after the first 100 pages it start getting better. It sort of remind me of my own relatinship with my husband. This is going to be a good conversation piece when the club meet Sunday 1/13/2008. The club is interested in life relating books that keeps our attention.Thank youPatricia YoungPresident of The Ladies Book Club"
2,This one just didnt do it for me.,"I really could not get into this book, I started it but could not finish it as well.Thank God I borrowed it from the library!!!"
3,Slow start...disappointing ending...,"I was expecting a fast pace, edge of my seat, uplifting Terry McMillan book, and this was not it. This was a more I'm going through the ""change"" and I want to talk about it book. I don't want to say that it was bad, it just wasn't that WOW you expect from McMillan. It was ordinary, any one could have written it. It had some attention grabbing parts, some laugh out loud sense but they were all out weighed by the dull parts. Just okay, no need to buy it, Borrow it!"
3,Not her best...,"Although I enjoyed Interruption as a quick read, I cannot assert that this new novel is as good as her past works. Marilyn Grimes is a familair character--we all know her. However, the narrative is slow-paced and the events are inconsequestial at best. The novel ends with too many loose ends. What happened to Lovey? Did her sister's children, in fact, come to live with Marilyn's family? What happend to the twins? The list goes on..."
2,Not the Terry I know,"This novel took me forever to read. I just couldn't get into it like her other books that only took me a couple of days. Finally, after about 70 pages, the pace picked up. Thank Goodness. I did get to a place where I couln't wait to see what happened next...BUT...NEVER...to a place where I just couldn't put it down. I hope her next novel is back to the old Terry."
2,Suprisingly Boring,"I am a Terry fan and have read all of her books with the exception of Stella, of which I saw the movie version. I have to agree with the previous writer that this is not our girl's best work. In fact, it's my least favorite of the 5 books I've read. I kept waiting for the climax and it never came, no pun intended. I suffered though this novel chapter after chapter, waiting for something big and surprising to happen to make it worth my while and that something never happened. I also agree that the friends of the main character, Marilyn Grimes, brought nothing to the table whatsoever. Terry put too much on her plate with this one and should have focused on one or two of the issues she explored in this work rather than a multitude. The story was flat and left me wishing I'd invested my time elsewhere. If you want a real good read, try her earlier novels, Disappearing Acts and Mama, my favorite."
4,The Interruption of Everything,"I read this book as a selection for my book club. This was a little different than what I expected, but still a great read."
1,Not Worth The Money,"I have been trying to get through this book for at least three weeks and still have 100 pages to go. The book has no plot, climax, nothing. It's nothing more than a book about a middle aged woman and her boring life. If there is any action I wouldn't know because I can't even bring myself to finish the book. As long as it took for Ms. McMillan to write another book she could've done much better."
3,Huh?,"Finally EXHALED after WAITING so long for Ms. McMillan's latest release - only to be sadly disappointed. Profound storyline, full of potential and worthy of attention. Unfortunately the writing was substandard based upon what I've grown accustomed to from this highly respected author."
2,Not exactly what I expected!!!,"I thought long and hard about how I would review this book. Which has never been the case when I've read all of Terry's other books. I found the book to be boring, hard to keep up with who's saying what, loose ends and I had to make myself keep reading because I just knew it would get better, but it never did. I also feel like I read the book for nothing. Sorry Terry, but this is definitely not your usual style.I hope you're maybe going through a midlife crisis and will come back to us .... but this is not exactly what I expected."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed the book very much, in fact, I read it within 2 days. While my life is not reflective of Marilyn's life, I saw glimpses of women I have known throughout my life in her experiences. There were a few typical events, but I see them play out in everyday life too. I think the reader has to be able to remove themselves from their life to appreciate this book. It did start out a little slow, but I love to read, so I always try to get past the first 4 chapters. Don't give up after reading the 1st chapter, keep on reading you may find it to be just as enjoyable as I did."
3,Page Turner,"If you are looking for a coming-of-middle-age page turner packed with colorful characters and set on an emotional roller coaster, this should be your next purchase. Terry McMillan can certainly capture the strength of women who are facing life's battles, even if they are internal."
4,Women Finally Wakes Up and Realizes She's POed at Her Family,"This book was fun to read, I started in on a Friday evening and had finished it by Sunday. I am a middle aged women who has her own spoiled family, it was so easy to identify with the main character, who has finally had it, and is angry. Terry McMillan has a great skill for writing dialog and the flow of reading this translated well to imaginging what I was reading from the words on the page to picturing each scenario in my mine, actually hearing how the characters were speaking and the emphasis they would use in their sentences as Ms. McMillan wrote them. Its a pleasure to find a novel you can identify with and that is so relaxing and enjoyable to read."
4,a good airport book,"An easy read with snappy dialogue, entertaining, and doesn't ask too much of the reader.It is for sure a chick book, whips up a lot of outrage towards men, as regards lack of appreciation for the things women (wives, Moms) do for them, and endure, for love.However, it has a certain emptiness as to character development, the sister particularly, and the attitude towards her Mom, is puzzlingly casual."
2,Close but not cigar!,"I've just finished the book and I've read the reviews. Yes, Marilyn (the book's main character) is going through her own personal drama but that was OK because a) we all do and b) it is, after a story.The story sets up nicely introducing characters and situations that seem unexpected and thought-provoking. However, not one of those situations is resolved. Not one of the characters finds a resolution. The book almost finished mid-conversation-like Ms. McMillan was way past deadline and just needed to finish or she is writing a sequel and we should patiently wait. I mean, I didn't expect every loose end to be tied, but it was really a dissappointing finish.Remember the last episode of the Soprano's? That's how I felt after finishing this book!"
1,just a chronicle of someone's life,"I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen and it never did. Joy her sister dies??? For what!? I thought Joy's life was getting better? Any way, nothing seemed connected. I wanted Marilyn to get back with her X Gordon. What was all that flirtation about....running into him at the Jill Scott concert, him showing up at her house.....admiring her work. Anyway, most women whould have thrown the husband out, when she first discovered his new clothes in the closet. Oh well......"
1,BORING BORING BORING,"The only reason I continued reading this book after page 25 is because Terry McMillan's name was on the cover. Marilyn Grimes is the most boring character to grace the pages of literature in a long long time and I really don't see what all the rave reviews are about. Will I buy Terry's next book? Yes, because everyone deserves one big flop. She'll bounce back. I have faith in her."
2,"Not That Exciting, It Could of Been Better","I was very surprised at Terry to have written such a book. It was very boring in the beginning, then kinda picked up towards the middle. Her previous writings were very much exciting, and I don't know what happened to her in this book. Hope the next one is will be worth my while to read. Don't waste your money on purchasing it - wait until it goes on sale."
2,A Disappointment,"I don't know who said this was a pageturner, because it is not. The first chapter was complicated and made me not want to continue to read, but because it's Terry McMillan, I continued. I didn't care for the way the book was written. It's not like her other books. This one, by far is the worse. Mama is her best work and Day Late, Dollar Short, is following closely beind that one. I was so tempted to buy this book because I was on the waiting list at the library for more than two months and I am so glad I did not purchase it. It was a struggle to just finish it. I'll probably read her next book because I'm sure it'll have something to do with deception and divorce about her husband's homosexuality. But there has already been a book written about that called ""Grown Folks Business,"" which I intend to read. But knowing Terry, she'll put hot sauce in her words to make it more spicy."
1,Come On .....,This book is like a boomerang ....... all over the place comes back ...... and what's the point? I mean she's writing the same things over and over to where you have to skip a couple chapters just to move the book along.
3,quick ending,"I have been a Terri fan for years. But this book was disappointing. The first 2/3rds were good. However, the ""wrap up"" felt rushed. And I was disappointed in the ending.It felt too holywood."
4,Great!!!,"I have been taking a long break from my reading habit, but recently decided to jump back in and selected this as the first book to read. I have always enjoyed Terry McMillan's books and really wanted to read this one since I felt like I had a lot in common with the main character. I loved this book from Page 1, which is not always the case for me with Ms. McMillan's books. I loved Marilyn and could definitely identify with a lot of things that she was feeling and experiencing. Her family and friends were such a trip; in fact, I felt like I knew them. I really liked the way that the unexpected pregnancy and the storyline with Marilyn and her husband was handled. All in all, I loved the book. And now, what to read next???"
3,"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT STILL A GOOD READ","I guess I'm not sure what I expected, but I bought this book when it first came out and just got around to reading it. Since it was released not too long after the turmoil in McMillian's life, I must have assumed a different storyline...see what happens when one assumes?In spite of my error, it was a good book (although, a bit slow for me)."
2,Not her best,I want the old Terry back. It took me over 2 weeks to complete this book. The main character made me want to scream! Not worth the money or time.
3,Book OK,"This book was not Terry McMillan's usual. I found it rather boring and quite predictable. I do however like the fact that Terry has been able to capture her life transitions in books and through her characters. As I read her book, I felt like I was reading a page from my own life and realized that I am going through many of things that she talked about. That could be the one reason why I found it rather boring. Hopefully when the book makes it to the big screen it will have a lot more ummph."
2,Skip this one unless you are a middle aged woman,"I think this book appeals to a certain audience, middle aged women. This book reads like the personal diary of the main character Marilyn, which is completely boring unless you personally relate to this character's stage of life. There are no univeral themes or interesting plots to engage those of us who are not middle aged women going through menopause. Basically, this book may as well be about menopause since the author keeps harping on the same theme over and over again. I am usually a big fan of Ms. McMillan, but I am struggling just to finish this book. I would put this one in the same category of How Stella Got Her Groove Back, skip them both. Try A Day Later and A Dollar Short, Mama, or Disappearing Acts instead. Your time would be better spent."
4,This book is a reflection of Terry maturing as a writer,"An enjoyable read. Slower than her usual works, but good just the same."
2,Predictable and Boring,"While there was some good humor in this story, it really trivialized relationship problems within a marriage!!!"
5,The Interruption of Everything - Excellent,The book was in excellent condition and was delivered within three days which I totally appreciated. Thank you!
4,Nicely Told Story,"Publisher's Weekly review outlined this book beautifully in their synopsis. I believe Terry writes from personal experience, for instance, like her book ""Stella"" came from her experience of meeting her soon-to-be ex-husband, Jonathan. ""Mama"" is about her own mother and siblings, and ""A Day Late"" is about the children from her book MaMa as adults. For me, a good story comes from within and expressed well. Ms. McMillan is a master storyteller.A personal note to Terry: Please read a novel called ""Grown Folks Business,"" by Victoria Christopher Murray. It will surely identify with what you are currently going through in your life with Jonathan and his ""downlow"" lifestyle. You can be assured that you are not alone in this journey. It's an epidemic that many woman can attest to."
4,Full of Laughter,"Ms. McMillan, did a splendid job in providing a vivid image in my mind of all the characters. I could identify with many of the characters especially the sisters Orange and blue had me laughing and crying. There are so many young girls who find themselves in the same situation. Thank you for not judging and preaching to us.I now know what I have to look forward to when going through the ""change"". I think this book encourages women to embrace going through the change. Learning to adapt and love yourself again.I have been encoraging all my friends to read this book.I hope this will be a movie someday. List of possible cast members -Ms. Angela(Marliyn), Ms.Lorietta ?, Ms. Cicely (autherine), Ms. Vivca(friend), Ms.Mo'Nique should definetly be on of her friends.I've got to read this book again to cast eveyone.(...)"
2,Terry will bounce back,"I was very dissapointed with this book. I was on the waiting list at my local library for this book since last summer when it was supposed to come out and I was really anticipating it's arrival. I found the book to be boring, and like one of the other reviewers, I kept reading because I JUST KNEW it was going to get better, but like the other reviewer said, it never did. Hopefully Terry will bounce back with her next book because we know she has it in her."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"WHEN I COMPARE THIS TO HER DEBUT NOVEL, ""MAMA"", IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE SAME AUTHOR. I AM ASTONISHED AT THE LACK OF PLOT IN ""INTERRUPTION."" IT IS A VERY BORING READ. THIS AUTHOR REALLY NEEDS TO GET BACK TO HER CORE GROUP OF CHARACTERS - THE ONES WE FELL IN LOVE WITH. I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED WASTING TIME NOR MONEY ON THIS BOOK."
4,Terry delivers fine work as usual,Although it was slow reading at first the last 100 pages or so are so full of drama and suspense that one can't help but be sucked into the main character's emotions. Clearly the author was in a bit of an angry place when she wrote the book but that just makes it all the more entertaining to read :)
2,CERTAINLY NOT MS. MCMILLAN'S BEST AND MOST LIKELY HER WORST!,"I had the feeling that this last book of Ms. McMillan's was a contractural obligation. Or rather, I am choosing to believe she had to get something out into the market. Because this book was down right boring, not at all entertaining and lack-luster, at best. She writes and entertains so much better than this.Whenever I've gotten word that she has a new book on the market, I run to buy it. I do not wait until it is on sale. I want to read her stuff immediately. I was pissed when I finished this book! I felt ripped-off. I suggest that Terry McMillan fans save their money and rent it from the library.I have read every single book that this fine woman has written, a couple of them I've read twice. I'm looking forward to her next book. Perhaps, she'll be on top of her game again."
2,Terry's Interruption,Reading Terry McMillan's latest novel left me disappointed. It read more like a first novel than an author who has reached a certain level in her literary career. The story was dull and uneventful.
3,Not her usual but still good!,"This book is definitely different from the classic Terry novels. It took me longer to read, but once I finished, it was worth reading. This book is truly a book for women."
2,Very disappointing!,"I have read other books by Miss McMillan, and I have enjoyed them. I was unaware of this book until Oprah announced she had bought the movie rights to ""The Interruption of Everything"" during an interview on her show with Terry. Oprah's announcement piqued my interest and I decided to read the book. I listened to the audiobook from the library. This book was so boring and hard to get into that it was a chore for me to continue to listen. I finally did finish the book. This book was very predictable."
3,meh . . .,"It's literally a list of sayings- no explanations, no context, nothing, just one saying after another. There are better books out there for ppl still learning spanish; but if you already speak spanish and are resourceful about looking stuff up or consulting w/ native speakers to explain the ones you can't make sense of, it wouldn't be bad."
4,A good example for IRON MAIDEN....,"Unlike Iron Maiden (who has been repeating his formula over and over again each time with less punch and with more fillers), SAxon manages to stays true to his roots, mantains their recognizable sound, but even doing so they still manage to add power, will and some new tricks in each record. This is the caso for LIONHEART, a very good metal album by the lords of metal."
2,Lyin' Heart,"First off, let me say that I'm a big Saxon fan. Have been since the ""Castle Donnington"" days. People seem surprised that a bunch of middle-aged guys could still be playing heavy metal and releasing records (no Spinal Tap jokes, please)? Why not? After all, their fan base, people like me are still there and have aged along with them. This really is not a superior Saxon recording and I suspect the band members know it. If there is any doubt as to why Saxon is no Iron Maiden, this new album answers it. The CD sounds annoyingly pedestrian and repetitive. No great hooks, melodies, sing-alongs, solos, or time signature changes to be found here. Twenty-first century Saxon? Try 21st century Maiden, Brave New World, for real listening enjoyment."
1,Time to call it a day lads,"What is this? A joke? Don't get me wrong I LOVE saxon.I grew up listening to albums such was wheels of steel,Strong Arm of the Law,and denim and leather (all worth checking out)So when I first listened to this album I was really disappointed,the singing to be quite honest is poor,the musicianship amatuerish.If you want to see how a bunch olf ""old timers"" can still produce good music check out Judas Priest's angel of retribution.This album sucks."
2,Their best album?,"This is great! For everybody who like Saxon: Please listen to this album! Saxon has made their best album ever! My favourite song is Witchfinder General which is also their best song ever! COngratulations, SAXON! You surprised me!"
4,NWOBHM LIVES ON!,"Saxon continues to impress with ""Lionheart"". Biff's unique vocals are as solid as ever. Wish they would tour the States soon!"
3,"no masterpiece, but....","This album struck me as being a very long demo, with about seven real gems placed between a lot of really forgetable songs. The album would have been a lot better if it was tighter -- at some points during the album it seems as if the brotha just got up and started mumblin' a few verses. That may be somewhat humorous to some, but it doesen't make a great album -- and certainly not a masterpiece. Cody gets five stars for talent, but three for a relatively lukewarm album."
2,the headphone masterpiece,"over rated, glib and too profance. i love sex, but he needs to cool his jets. underwhelmed and repetitive"
1,Master of nothing,"Headphone masterpiece? Maybe for the deaf. Ches-nut can barely play guitar, and his lyrics only serve to illustrate how unintelligent and immature he really is. But then again, we live in a world where so much [garbage] passes as music. This is in the same category as every third rate one-hit wonder that has aired on MTV over the past decade. American idol will last longer than this."
5,cody chesnuTT,"Cody ChesnuTT is a genius, despite what the majority of all reviewers are saying. One of my favorite tracks on this album is Up in the Treehouse.His music is so honest and it clearly shows his soul. The man is giving you his heart in this album.One of the greatest albums of all time."
4,A breath of fresh air!!!!!,"I love this CD!! So it sounds like he recorded it in his bathroom, so what? His lyrics and subject matter do it for me. I wouldn't be caught dead listening to some of this crap out there right now. He is what the record industry needs--someone who can put out a bare-bones record, and still make more sense that all of that MTV-shiny, commercial bull plop that the radio can't stop playing. He is his own man, and it shows. My favorite track--""No One Will"". He sounds like he's whispering in your ear!! Sexy!!So some people say that he has a big ego. And???? What some people don't understand is this--he made his CD HIS WAY, not to please the masses in the suburbs. He's done something alot of people haven't done, or can't do. He has unleashed all he has into this CD, and at times, it's overwhelming. But I have been playing it ever since I got it!! I can't wait to see what he puts out next!!"
3,"He has ""it""","3 1/2 starsNever mind the intentionally loose and lo-fi production of this album..Listen to the scope of this man's compositions, the purity of conviction in his vocals, and the ease and assuredness with which he accomplishes all of this on a double album debut..May this not be a fluke, and may we continue to enjoy this man's fruition as an artist..One of the more personalised debuts of our time, and certainly one of the most eclectic, daring albums to come straight from the streets in a long time."
3,Almost the masterpiece it claims to be,"This is an amazing collection of work from an extremely talented young man. However, I'm disappointed that someone as talented as Mr. Chesnutt feels the need to use so much profanity, and just plain off-color references. This album is so near to perfect, and for me, it's just ruined by crude references and the usual derogatory references to women. Not that I would purchase a Wal-Mart-ized santized version of the album, because I do believe in free speech. I'm just disappointed in the choice of words and references on some tracks, which makes this collection unable to achieve the headphone nirvana it comes so close to."
2,"Masterpiece, my ass!!","Masterpiece?.....I don't think so. Derivative as hell?...Definately!! If Lenny Kravitz ever gets around to releasing an album of outtakes it'll probably sound a lot like this. Thats not to say there aren't some decent songs on here, it's just that they are all done in the style of another artist.His influences are clearly Stevie Wonder,Curtis Mayfield, Prince,Beatles and some rap thrown in too. Some of these songs aren't even completed, just half baked ideas.Cody should take a tip from The Roots who greatly improved on ""The Seed"" with their more fleshed out cover version. His overweening arrogance seems insecure and is greatly off putting. Cody does posess real talent as a songwriter but is a rather flat singer prone to going off-key here and there. Next time hopefully he will get a good producer and band and take his time finishing his songs and not release demo quality crap."
3,A diamond that needs a good deal of polishing.,"Cody Chesnut's debut, as a growing majority of people seem to agree, holds a great deal of promise. The chords, rifs, and lyrics on many of the tunes are original, funny, and nice to listen to. What Mr. Chesnutt needs more than anything right now is a producer and a drummer. Many of the songs have a beat that was clearly generated from a $500 keyboard. Some people may find this to be kitchy or indie, I find it to be amateur. He would also benefit from recording in a professional studio. Many of the tracks feature a hiss or that whole ""I want the song to sound like an old record crackling effect"" that is tired, played out, and again amateur. After putting out his song ""The Seed"", The Roots rerecorded it with him, and the difference is amazing. I anxiously await his next album."
2,"low quality, lots of quantity though","i have to agree with some of the other reviewers with the fact that the 4track definitely wasn't the way to go on this. after listening for about 20minutes your head/ears/eyes start to hurt from straining to understand the man. what you can understand though comes through as very original. this guy has alot to say and tried to say it all at once. i'm gonna go out on a limb and say 1-hit wonder, eventhough no 1 song really stands out. mediocre album at best."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"my two cents: I saw this album listed as one of Spin's top 40 albums of the year. Usually I find Spin's opinion to be pretty good so I figured I'd pick this one up. Also, there is a fantastic version of Seed on the Roots new Phrenology album (highly recommended). So needless to say, I was hoping for a good album...and what I got was not. I'm not sure what all the five-star album hype is about. One glaring problem is that there is a whole lot of filler on the two discs. I can see why record companies would not have wanted to put this out as-is on their labels. Here and there, every four tracks, you do find a good promising song complete with verses and choruses, however that is very few and far between. On the positive side though, I will say that Cody definitely shows promise. Had this been pared down into say 40 minutes of tracks, it might be better. Overall I'd say don't believe the hype on this one. But watch out when his next album drops..."
2,"Has talent, but it does not reflect on this release","Cody Chesnutt has talent, but this double CD is only worth 2 stars (IMHO), unless you are a hardcore fan. Besides the gutter mouth on most songs (parents should not play this in range of children), the CD is difficult to listen to because of the lo-fi approach. Cody has talent and it will be shown in future releases, but this CD suffers from 1), being too long and 2) lack of production and a thought out musical approach. Broken down this CD has about 5-6 songs that are worthy of listening to more than once, but none that are favorites. Bottom line: Gutter mouth master, not worth the money."
4,this double cd kicks ass,"an excellent cd, although certain tracks aren't really musical and reminiscent of ""wet my bed"" from stone temple pilots. However, there are an abundance of really good, fresh songs. when this cd got locked in my broken cd changer i went through cody chesnutt withdrawal is all i'm trying to say here, the best cd of 2003"
