5,offspring rocks,Ive listen to this c.d over and over again since I was growing up. This is the best offspring c.d out in my opinion. Their newer stuff just isn't the same.
4,"yea, they sure as hell changed it","You people out there saying this cd sucked need some help. Just cuz it's not Smash doesn't mean it isn't good. Just cuz it went mainstream don't mean it's not good. If it's different than the other cds, just accept it, and stop nagging! This is a great cd, and probably the most diverse one the offspring has ever made. Yea, sure, it's not as gritty as Ignition, and it doesn't have the indie feel of the first 3 cds. this is one awesome cd, despite it's short length. those of you who think that they should return to the classic sounds of their first 4 cds may be right, but splinter is a revelation of diverse sounds, and people should come to realize that."
2,50 steps down,"i'll tell everyone about this album. im gonna sum it up in 1 word ""it sucked"" and why? because the offspring have been a band for 20 years, and in thoes 20 years, we have seen some of the best work, toching lyrics, and lyrics about everyday life. and each album (from self titled, to conspiracy of one) we have gotten about 13-15 songs on each and every album. but now we get this crap, 10 songs (neocon, and when your in prison dont count) and with only 4 good songs on it (the noose, never gonna find me, lightning rod, and da hui)the other songs (long way home, hit that, race againset myself, spare me the details, the worst hang over ever, and when your in prison) were all songs that hurt the album. im not saying they were bad songs, but its not somthing thats not appropriate, and have no meaning to them at all."
2,Going Down,"I'd have to say that ever since Conspiracy of One came out, they haven't been doing all that great. I've read a few reviews that say that it's not how they should be playing i.e. Smash :P All I have to say though is that no matter what band it is, if it sounds like this then it's bad. No matter who or what is playing it. The songs have no real feeling to me. Usually the songs will get to me; you know, that wierd feeling you get in your stomach that makes you like the song so much. None of the songs really did that for me... that's all I really have to say."
2,"""Can't Repeat""","As stated quite eloquently by the gentleman below, Splinter does infact suck. The Offspring are releasing ""Can't Repeat"" soon, and although I've only heard the first two minutes and fifteen seconds of it, I can safely say that it's better than everything off Splinter. Despite the fact that Dexter's vocal pattern during the verses is ripped straight from ""The Kids Aren't Alight"", the guitar riff wasn't recycled from any previous Offspring songs. The clip I heard cuts off right before the point where the solo should kick in, so I haven't heard the entire thing, but the intro (with a bass line VERY similar to ""LAPD"" and the sound of an airplane engine revving up) is awesome. It's not groundbreaking, but it'll do. To bad we have to settle for ""it'll do"" with the Offspring nowadays."
5,A very Delightful Book,"All of London was wagering on who would warm the cold heart, cool the hot temper, and win the precious hand of young, wealthy, and beautiful Miss Amelia Clerville. But Amelia faced a gamble of her own as she came ever closer to being cornered by the two frontrunners of her pack of swarming suitors. There was the iron-willed, compellingly ruthless Sir Julian Denventer, a battering ram of an aristocrat who was breaking down her resistance. And there was the insufferably arrogant Marquis of Tyrone, who had the infuriating impudence to pretend he did not want her. Amelia feared that one of them was a thief, the other a murderer-and if she made the wrong choice, her worst fears would come true. An very entertaining book."
4,Pretty Good,"I only jog a little but I do alot of trail walking. This stroller has held up to lots of different terrain. I'm sure a Bob or other big $$$ stroller would do better but for the cost, this stroller is wonderful. We put my son in many strollers (including Schwinn, Bob, etc) and this was the best fit for him. He was 5 months old at the time of purchase and now he's 11 mo.My only issues are the bars on the side. They should be padded. Also, the alignment is a bit off and I'll have to get that fixed."
2,Fabric Ripped!,"I wrote an earlier review ravng about this stroller - but now I've had it for a year and my opinion has changed. The frame has ripped the farbic on the bottom of the stroller. My 18 month old little girl only weighs 23 lbs, so her weight should not be enough to damage this stroller - but is has. I still use the stroller, but we have to stop once or twice on our walk to pull the frame back into place because it falls through the hole that it ripped. I am dissapointed in this stroller."
5,excellent product,"The other reviews complaining about this product have no clue what they are talking about. This is an excellent jogger at an exceptional price, better than most joggers twice the cost."
3,Malibu Mom,"I had a baby jogger before this, but it didn't recline or fold. That's why I bought this one. I love the look of it, but the problem is....1. It's much heavier.2. The harness is hard to use and the straps are rough.3. When it's reclined my baby can look out through the mesh exposing him to the sun and distracting him from the business at hand.... going down for his nap!Here's the upside:1. I love the cup holder.2. The recline feature helps him sleep.3. It's streamlined, nice and narrow.Question: Does anyone know if I can buy thinner more lightweight wheels like my baby jogger had? Also, is there any add on that will cover the mesh when it's reclined?I just wanted to share that I saw a wonderful add on back east in N.Y. called Protect a bub sunshade attachment. It's the most full coverage I've ever seen to make sure your babies legs are fully shaded. I always use a blanket which can blow around on a windy day."
1,WARNING INSTEP HAS EXTREMLY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,I BOUGHT THIS STROLLER RECENTLY AND WHILE I WAS USING IT THE FRONT WHEEL FELL OFF.AS IF THAT WASN'T AWFUL ENOUGH I HAVE TRIED 3 TIMES TO GET THE NEW PARTS I NEED TO REPAIR THE STROLLER.ALL TO NO AVAIL. I ACTUALLY ORDERED THE PARTS OVER THE PHONE. WAS TOLD THEY WOULD ARRIVE WITHIN&amp;quot; 7 TO 10 DAYS&amp;quot;. 2 MONTHS LATER AND SEVERAL INQUIRIES I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE THE NEEDED PARTS TO REPAIR THE STROLLER AND USE IT.IT IS BROKEN AND I'M DISCUSTED WITH THIS COMPANY FOR NOT HELPING ME GET THIS STOLLER FIXED. I DON'T THINK THATS TOO MUCH TO ASK.KEEP THIS IN MIND IT IS IMPORTANT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THE STROLLER THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.
2,baby hates it,"I have a ten month old, who just hates to sit in this stroller. I haven't figure out why yet. I think he may hit his head on the two bars that encase the seating area or he hates the degree of recline. All I know is I can't get far from the house until he starts screaming and crying, which sends me right back home. So much for getting some exercise."
5,"""What a delightful book!""","""What a delightful book! SPIRIT INCORPORATED provides the reader with many common sense, down-to-earth tips and vignettes on how to ethically live life to the fullest in a spirit of giving."" -- H. Stanley Jones, author of Quality of Life: Achieving Balance in an Unbalanced World."
1,D.O.A.,Giving the toaster 1 star for appearance - can't judge its effiency as a toaster because it was dead on arrival. First piece of toast went halfway down and stopped. Elements never lit. Tried unplugging and restarting - no go. Pretty disappointing after waiting nearly 2 months for toaster to be delivered. Shame on you Farberware quality control!
1,farberware dissapointment,"the fct200 ""down right"" classic toaster failed to go ""down right ""just under the warranty expiration. it took 4 telephone calls to get the replacement which took nearly three months to arrive. very dissapointed with product and customer service."
2,Worked Great (for about 4 months)...,"We purchased this after an exhaustive search into quality toasters. I had heard and read good things about this toaster. For about 4 months, we LOVED this toaster! It toasted evenly, worked smoothly, was easy to clean. Suddenly, it stopped working. It would not lower, elements would not light up, it would do nothing. I should have just gone with the Dualit originally, rather than continuously replacing lesser toasters."
1,BAD FIRE HAZARD DO NOT USE THIS TOASTER,"With no human intervention, this toaster turned it'self on and ran for quiet some time before the smoke caught our attention. The top of the toaster is totally burnt up. This thing has a mind of it's own. Do not even consider purchasing this expensive fire hazzard!"
1,fire hazard,"After only 2.5 years, it is a fire hazard. The toast won't pop up. Even if there is no bread, the coils will not cool. It stays ON and toasting regardless. THe cancel button does not work."
1,Not satisfied,"My dog gets very hot in the summer months so I decided to get this product to see if it would help her cool off. I agree with the other commenters here. It takes a long time to soak, you have to wring the water through to get it completely saturated, and then try to find a place for this wet thing. I had to put towels on it and place it on a cot before my dog would sleep on it. Even so, before long it seemed to be getting a little on the moldy side, which I guess I should have seen coming, so I threw it away. Its not worth the money.For a recommendation, check out the Cool Bed 3. I purchased one for my dog and she loves it. Even though its cold outside now, she still sleeps on it rather than her more expensive cushion bed. I am now in the process of getting a larger one for her and will give the medium one to a friend."
4,Kitty likes it!,"I bought this for a feral cat I care for to help her keep cool in the Phoenix summer heat. She likes it and uses it a lot. She doesn't like to lay on it when it's wet, though (it takes a couple hours for the surface to dry out after soaking). Item seems a little pricey for what you get (the mat is small), but the cat is happy and the mat does what it promises, so I think it was money well spent."
1,worst matt invention for dogs,this matt is filled with water then swells up.thye say soak it ion a bucket of water OK yes it does that and its wet for days and dog wont sit on a wet matt nor would I.piece of wet-junk
4,"took her a while to get used to it, but she loves it now!","I do outdoor art festivals in the spring/summer and usually travel with my shih tzu. Sometimes it gets too hot and if I don't have electricity, I can't even run a fan. When I first got it and put her on it, she couldn't wait to get off, but I kept at it and always patted her and tried to rub her belly when she was laying on it. Now she loves it! She has dug a few holes in one side and I patched them up with duct tape when it was dry. I'll buy another when this one falls apart, but it has lasted me 4 or 5 years so far."
2,I don't like it.,The seller tears apart too many pages in the book. This causes me trouble in using the book.
2,roller skating rink organ !,"Slim was one of the best blues pianists ever. And this album has some fine piano blues on it too.But almost every other song has Slim playing a roller skating rink sounding organ which grates on my nerves. If you like blues organ, then fine, but if you're looking for some of Slim's classic piano blues ,this might not be the album for you to purchase."
1,Outdated,"This book was disapointing as it covers nothing new and fails to cover aspects of stamp dealing on the internet. Since a lot of stamp auctions are now done through the internet, perhaps this is a book more suitable for those who are primarily focussed on local American markets. Definitely not recommended for international buyers."
3,You Have to Punch It,"First of all, I wish I would have known it came with salt in it. I didn't want to buy a grinder already filled with salt. I wanted to put my Celtic Sea Salt into the grinder. I feel like I'm wasting the salt if I throw it out. Second of all, you have push down and punch the salt out. I guess it grinds it on the push. It's kind of odd, but kind of fun. It might put out too much of a concentration of salt for some people. It looks nice and slim (I don't think it's going to hold much salt), but I wish I would have selected something a bit different."
2,I didn't know it was travel sized,"I'm very disappointed with this salt mill. First of all, it is tiny. On the box it says that it is ""travel sized"", but nowhere in the Amazon reviews did it mention the diminutive size. The container holds very little salt and I find the mechanism difficult to adjust to get a decent amount of salt to come out of the thing. I have to pump, pump, and pump to taste any salt. On the plus side, it does look good."
3,Looks better than it is,"Good looking and works well, in dry weather. Very little salt comes out when it's humid. The capacity of this mill is small."
5,Finally I found a great salt grinder!,"I have used them all, from traditional shaped grinders to things that looked like a rabbit with ears, but nothing could seem to do the trick for me. I wanted something that looked good (not like a reject from a bad picnic) but also functioned well and would not break easily. This salt grinder fits the bill. It is sexy looking and works like a charm. The business end of the grinder is all metal and that is what I love about it.The ONLY con I have found about this grinder is that it is not the largest in the world, and filling it could be easier. When they make a JUMBO version I am all over it. Till then.. I guess I will have to reduce my sodium consumption."
4,Works well but comes with a little surprise,"This appears to be a high quality pump style grinder however, when I received the product, I was surprised to find that it had a large black logo of a grill manufacturer on the side of it. I used a rubbing compound and LOTS of elbow grease and was finally able to get it off. I also had to return one as the top of the pump handle broke off after just a couple of uses. I had no problems with the exchange. Otherwise the product works well and looks great!"
2,"Looks and works cool, but a piece of junk","Stylish, worked well at first, handling dry, coarse salt. Within a few months, it began to come apart regularly, just falls apart, dumping the contents of salt on your plate! Disappointing."
3,"Great feel, great grind, just get the right salt and hope you don't have to clean.","While the feel you get from using this pump is unequaled, the mechanism is almost impossible to clean or scrub without destroying your cleaning tool. Also, when you pick a salt, make sure it is 100% dry as any wet sea salt will bind and not grind in this pump. I had to order another pump to replace one that i had ordered previously after it rusted internally."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by the packaging of the product. I ordered a new ""Pump & Grind"" Salt Mill and it looked used to me. Also, took a long time to be delivered."
3,Grinds Too Well... Lots of Salt - Have to start sideways,"1. I have the pepper version so decided to get the salt version.2. Although adjustable for salt size (no instructions) you just change how screwed on the base is. So you have to figure out this part.3. One pump puts out a lot of salt...I mean a lot...so often grind into my hand and then use that to measure out my salt4. Doesn't grind from a straight up and down position. You have to pretty much hold it at a 45 degree angle to start the first grind (salt too hard for start-up) and then you can angle it downwards more from then on...but remember...lots of salt comes out, so maybe don't need to grind much more.5. Mine came with 'WEBER GRILL' and a logo printed on the side of it. This obviously was from a promotion that they had too many of and decided to throw it into the mix. Wasn't worth sending it back, gonna use rubbing alcohol and steel wool to see if I can get that off."
5,What a cool little gadget,I now have both the pepper and salt mill. They're great for the table because they only require one hand. I also like the heft and feel of them. They're very solid and well made. I have a pair of very nice Peugeot salt and pepper mills that I prefer for the kitchen because they dispense larger amounts of their respective seasonings. But for the table these are really nice.
4,fun and classy,"After being introduced to the Pump & Grind at a dinner party, I knew I had to have one. First place I looked was Amazon.com and there it was, much cheaper than I thought it would have cost. Its a great piece of machinery, very well made and grinds salt finer than what you would expect. It's handy, easy to use and would warrant a fifth star if it contained a bit more salt and lady friends sometimes have to use two hands to use."
5,Best Salt Mill Ever,"Pepper mills are easy to find. Salt mills vary greatly in quality. I purchased my first one as a gift for a friend, and when I tried it out at home, the friend never got the present! Well, not until this year when I discovered it on Amazon and was able to purchase it under their famous 4-for-3 promotion."
3,Works well.,"Works very well, but it's kinda on the small side (probably better for table setting). Gives your hand a good workout. I hope it lasts longer than the battery operated one I have that broke down after a year."
1,"Good songs, very poor recording quality.","The songs are what I wanted, however the quality of the song recordings was terrible! The songs were obviously not CD quality and the recordings were simply taken off old, scratchy vinyl records. Not worth the money!"
1,Not for 3 year olds,It was a gift to my 3 year old for his birthday and within 5 minutes out of the box my wife predicted it was not safe. Within another 10 minutes she was proven correct in exactly the way that she forewarned - just shear luck he didn't lose an eye.(When a small kid holds the handle and pulls the trigger the rod that 'creates' the flame is about 3 or 4 inches from the eyes. If the child is running (and what else would you expect when playing with a spaceship) and trips ... . In my son's case it went straight up his nose - but it could equally well have gone into an eye.
5,Great Quality - Great Price,"Working with this company was a pleasure, product shipped out next day. Excellent quality, great price. I would recommend them in a heart beat!"
2,Quilted Table Pad,"I was disappointed with this pad. It had creases in the vinyl that won't come out. I spent 1 hour trying to iron them out with no success. The pad was not cut straight, it is crooked, and has jagged edges."
3,Table pad is not padded.,"This is little more than a flannel lined vinyl tablecloth. Will use for now, but am already looking to replace with something that has more padding."
3,Just pass over this one.,"This book is not only uninteresting, but it also insults the intelligence of the average person. The author finds himself in a situation where he is placed into an environment where his level of intelligence is the norm. He struggles with this identity crises of no longer being an intellectual elite but a commoner. His criticisms of the teaching methodologies are inconsistent within the context of his story. Don't waste your time or money."
1,PC brat meets Harvard Law School,"The story of a law student who feels the pain of every conceivable minority group and wants to use his knowledge of the law to make a ""contribution"" to society, i.e. tell everyone else what to do. The author is unbelievably self-centered and arrogant. His descriptions of some law professors and law firms are good. But the lingering question is why Senator Charles Robb of Virginia hired a guy like this."
2,dissapointing,I guess I thought this book would show me step by step how to build an earthen oven. After reading it cover to cover I still don't know how to build one. This book was no help
4,Earth oven,"This book came highly recommended from a friend who actually built one and they are loving the bread and pizza that they have started making! Can't wait to build this, good instructions for oven!"
4,Lots of tips and tricks,Takes the wonder out of building with dirt and clay mixtures. I'll be building a pizza oven at my camp this coming summer.
5,The Book for Building an Earthen Oven!!!,"A+++! This book is the perfect guide to building your own earthen oven, adding on a hand sculpted design, and it even shows you other design options. It has everything you need for the basics of making a working earthen oven and then leaves tons of room for your own creativity and design ideas. I really loved this book and we have already built a small prototype. The author combines logic and science with creativity and art, you have to love it!"
5,Great Book,This book was exactly what I was hoping for. Lots of great information. Several wonderful pictures! I cant wait for summer so I can try to make my own. thanks
5,Great!,Very comprehensive and detailed. Going to start on my oven this weekend! Prep work shouldn't take too long and great pictures for constructing my own.
5,Bread baked out the back door!,"Kiko's new book presents a more in depth discussion than the previous edition, of clay ovens one could build in their backyard, from their backyard. The use of hand drawn illustrations and photographs leave little mystery as to designing, creating and using these ovens, with a great deal of freewill fanciful inspiration captured and relayed to the reader. From 'engineering' to trouble shooting, a down to earth (literally) guide to getting in touch with our true nature of living simply."
4,Very Infomrative - Easy to read,"This book on building mud ovens (also known as ""cob"") was easy to read and the illustrations were great. The author explains a lot of history on where this traditional type of oven originated from and its uses. I enjoyed the ""back to nature"" attitude of doing things with your hands and the community feeling of such a project. Variations on this type of oven would fit into many lifestyles. The bread recipes were good, but as anyone knows, baking bread is an art that must be practiced and refined over time; if you are desiring ""Artisan"" bread baking. Pair this book up with ""The Bread Builders."""
5,Build Your Own Earth Oven,"Brilliant, ..... well worth the investment. Easy to read and understand. Great ideas for designs. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to build an outdoor earth oven."
5,Great resource,Great little book. I'm building my oven right now. Well written with easy to understand instructions.
5,An Amazingly Entertaining Book,"In my search to find humorous fantasy this is one of the gems of my collection. Bogen writes a great misadventure of a young magician thrist out into the world to find his own way. The book read very quickly, though it was in part because of my enthusiasm to see what was in store for the ""hero"" in the next chapter. It is a shame that more books did not come out in this series, but if you can find this one, grab it and add it to your collection."
5,Pure Creative Fun!,"Excellent read for all ages, quick wit and humor abound. Lot's of creative energy, we will all be mighty furtunate when the next books in the series appear!"
3,interesting alternative to other OO books,"This has the merit of being the first book to consider analysis from an OO pespective, but it does so in a distinctly data oriented way(as the title suggests). It is hard to see how behavioural modelling fits. The companion volume ""Object Lifecycles"" is essential reading if you want to apply this technique successfully in anything like an OO style.This might make a good bridge for someone with an IM background moving into OO analysis/design. Other texts address this area much better now and apart from historical interest I can't really recommend it to a newcomer to the field."
2,An Unworthy Sequel to Headhunter,"Remember how good Headhunter was? Well this book doesn't even come close. I don't know whats happened to Slade, but the last several books have been mediocre at best. This book features two seperate plot lines, because apparently they couldn't think of just one interesting enough to engross the reader. Very anticlimatic and a letdown overall."
2,Scooby-Doo anyone?,"What is this? Not only is the book full of mind-numbingly inane ""Kattisms"", the ending is so utterly putrid, I have lost faith in the Slade writers. Research, as always, was excellent but could not possibly make up for the sludge trotted out in the second part of the book. Evil Eye, too, suffered from a similarily bad ending. Slade needs to get back to the likes of Ripper or Cutthroat - suspense and gore and great story-telling."
2,Too Much,"This book started out with promise. There is too much information. I'm all for learning a little in a book but I felt like I was reading a history book. There are too many characters, one very unlikable one named Katt. And some things seem farfetched. It seems a little unbelievable that one character would survive such a vicious bear attack. It took a while to get through this. Hopefully his other books are better."
4,"not his best, but worth the read","A committed Slade fan, I've been a bit disappointed in his last 2. Not quite up to their best, Ripper or Ghoul (my favorite) in terms of depth and pervisity of plot, but well above the average for the genre. I did miss the lack of a teaser or loose threads at the end. I, tho, wouldn't mind putting DeClercq on the back burner and doing more with Zinc or Craven, who were both shortchanged in this one. I must agree with other reviewers that Katt is overdone somewhat obnoxious. The research, as usual, is fascinating and near impeccable. One slip, which surprised me given their normal standards: The AR-15 is the civilian version of the M-16. It is NOT fully automatic. In fact, neither is the M-16 anymore; it fires 3-round bursts. No one's perfect."
3,Not for the weak of heart,This series of books is not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. I found that after reading a few they became a bit repetative.
3,"""Misunderstood""","I very much enjoyed the cd, 2007 Grammy Nominees. I guess I thought and was hoping that it would be a copy of what the nominees had sung the night of the Grammy Awards, and it was not.I especially wanted to hear Christina Agulara singing ,""This is a Man's World"", as a tribute to the late James Brown. I guess I misunderstood."
1,very tired disc&list of nominations,"I just didn't find any of these songs that memorable. now I dig some of John Mayer's stuff ,but alot of the acts on here&the songs on here just didn't move me at all. I didn't see how any of the acts on here could have multi grammy nominations. 'Crazy"" was cool for a minute but it got over-played&felt gimmicky after a while. I dig some of Cee Lo's stuff,but again I can't see the song getting all of the hype it's gotten. I felt last year was very slow in terms of a stand out song&also any One Act truly knocking it out of the park for me."
2,Sounds seem MP3ish,"I buy real cds as opposed to downloading them on services online because real CD's don't have the ""unhearable"" sounds filtered out by the MP3 type compression.For some reason it sounds like this CD was made from MP3's. The bass just isn't as clean and as present as it is on a few of the original CD's I have of the artists I have from this CD. Not sure what's up with it."
3,Good CD; Defective Packaging,A nice collection of songs--good party music. Was delivered in a broken CD case. The broken case surprised me since this was a new CD (at a new CD price) direct from the manufacturer.
3,A good mix of Pop music,"I would agree with THATCH ""RST"", if you are into sound quality, this is not the CD for you. However, if you like to listen to Pop music at home or while driving, this is the cd for you. This is one of the first Grammy CDs that I have purchased in a while, considering, I have boycotted the Grammys for the past few years, because I thought that real artists weren't being recognized. Well, that seems to be changing. We'll see..."
4,Good book for background knowledge,This book is good for background knowledge of soil behavior but I wish it had more examples of calculations for engineering properties of soils.
1,The worst organized video book ever,I accidentally ordered this book instead of the video book I normally order (the one by Mick Martin). It is far more difficult to find a listing for a movie in the Maltin book...their means of alphabetizing the movie listings is the oddest I have ever encountered in a book. It is poorly organized and haphazard. Didn't the editors graduate high school?
1,trust only yourself,"it would be tremendously foolish to buy this guide and trusting it blindly to know what movie to see. If you do, you would miss some of the coolest movies ever, in the case of this guy Maltin, but that's not the point. Trusting ANY reference, including movie sites like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, is foolish. If you do so, you'll also miss some really great stuff that you might love. You should just watch movies that you're interested in, really. There's always going to be some critically-lambasted movie that you end up enjoying, so never trust a critic or movie guide, or movie site, just your instincts. BTW, Maltin's is one of the worst movie guides ever, full of misguided, wrong-headed reviews. This is truly the last movie guide you should look into."
1,Minutiae,"Leonard Maltin does not like movies -- and he's a film critic. He's around to puke boring invectives and pointlessly spot cameos and other minutiae no one regards as vital trivia. It all comes down to Roger Ebert, the only enduring reviewer who cares about cinema. NB: Maltin has no friends."
2,Not enough product,I have an older cat that sprays. He was an outside cat until I rescued him so I don't know his background. I was desperate to find something that would remove this terrible odor and had tried all the name brand odor removers. I applied F.O.N. as directed and it seemed to help for a day or so and then the odor would return. The bottles are small. Perhaps there was not enough product to really tell if F.O.N. works.
4,pet product,"This was not quite as effective as I thought it would be, but it does a fair job if the stain isn't too old."
1,HORRIBLE THIS COMPANY DOES HORRIFIC TESTS ON ANIMALS!!,"do not buy this productwe called ""summit hill laboratories"" and they DO test on animals"
2,Inaccurate reviews and product description,"I have been reading the reviews about this 'Royal Twist Design' set from ChipsAndGames, most of them are good. I was looking for numbered chips and this set was among the cheapest I could find, so I went for it. But when I received the product, I was shocked to find that the chips are PLAIN without any designs or numbering. I contacted the seller and they confirmed that there is no mistake because the photos do show plain chips, and what you see is what you get. They also said that they can't remove inaccurate reviews from other customers.My point is, PokerGoods has an identical product also called 'Royal Twist Design'. Their photo shows a fanned poker flush design with numbering (1,5,25,50,100). I believe that the other reviews on this ChipsAndGames item were posted wrongly. You should rely on the seller's photos rather than the reviews, especially the outdated ones. So if you want plain chips, get ChipsAndGames. If you want numbered chips, look elsewhere."
4,Love this Season,This was a great addition to my DVD collection. I have the first 3 seasons and in this 4th season is Mr. Furley (Don Knotts). You gotta love this guy although I must confess I missed the Ropers. Anyhow I rated this only 4 stars because one of the episodes on the discs is silent!!! :( This sucks! I've tried and tried again but it wouldn't play the sound. Other than that I was glad with my purchase.. Hope this helps! By the way for those who are familiar with the first 3 seasons I just wanted to make an observation. It seems to me they made Chrissy dumber through the seasons LOL!
2,not happy,"still have not received it, taking to long as I usually get my orders fairly quickly but still waiting for it"
4,Three's Company DVD 4th Season,Very good quality DVD. I have purchased DVD's from another site and the quality was horrible. This one plays good and I really like the comedy in Three's Company.
5,GET ALL EIGHT SEASONS!,These box sets are really nice and you must own all of them!!! HOURS OF FUN!!
5,Kids Love it,Got this for our granddaughter. She loves it. Took it to the pool to try it out when we got it. 3 young boys swarmed it... Our other granddaughter has an order in for her upcoming birthday. I was impressed with the construction. Pretty solid. Guess I'll be getting another one in a few months. All the battery warnings a little intimidating but I guess that's the norm these days.
4,seadoo sea scooter,"Product performs as expected. Lots of fun. Good battery life. Some issue replacing nose/battery cap, but works out fine.Overall, I would recommend this item. I bought one and kids love it in the pool."
3,Poor customer service,"When I received this item, the battery would not charge, even after it was left on the charger for over 24 hours. After talking to the company, they would not send me a new battery, but requested that I take the battery in to be volt tested and diagnose the problem myself. They claimed it could be the battery or the charger that was defective. When I requested that they send me BOTH parts and I would return what wasn't needed, they stated that they had too many part requests to comply with my request. All this was after three days of trying to get someone to return my phone messages. I am sorry I can't review the product itself, but the customer service has been so poor that I don't have a working product. It looks like great fun for the kids, and Amazon's return policy is great, so I rated it 3 stars and I will return it to Amazon."
4,Great in the pool!,Nieces and grandkids love the Sea Doo in the pool. This is the 2nd one we have purchased in the last six years.
1,Poorly made,"Approx the 5th time that we used this scooter, water penetrated the battery compartment and damaged the battery and internal components. It is unclear as to how to retun the item, so it looks like I am stuck with such a poor product."
1,NOT HAPPY!! Dont buy from this SELLER!!,got the product as promised - battery won't charge light doesn't go green - stays red - have tried EVERYTHING and it will not work - NO RETURN POLICY and THE REPLACEMENT BATTERY IS EXPENSIVE
3,Extensive user,"We have used several of these for over a year---in lakes as well as our pool. The kids love them. I was impressed with how long the battery lasts---they can play with them at least an hour on one charge.Only negative, one failed after about a year---some kind of problem with the electronic controls."
3,Great serial... shame about the discs!,"If you know anything about serials then you know that the Crimson Ghost is a one of the best. Unfortunately, whoever mastered this particular set had the compression turned up way too high. I don't know why... it's a three disc set with four chapters on each disc! Very strange. All the Australian Rocket releases suffer from the same trouble. You can still enjoy the serial but I really wish VCI had a version out. 5 stars for the serial. 1 star for the discs."
1,Disappointing!,"This product is definitely over-priced! The craftsmanship is mediocre, the glass has sharp, uneven edges, and it only seems stable if a small candle is used in the lantern. I originally placed a 3x9 inch candle in the lantern and it made the stand seem unstable. I am disappointed in the product; however, with a candle lit at night it is very pretty from a distance. But not if you pay attention to the quality of the product itself. As I said, it's very over-priced."
1,Defective out of the box,"Purchased this goboscope about 2 weeks ago it was defective out of the box, the speed wheel did not function at all (this seems to be a reoccurring problem with American dj products) American dj said they would fix it (takes 2 weeks) so after ordering time and having to send it back, I should have a useable product in about.... A MONTH!.... so if you got the time to waste waiting for something that will need repair when you open it, try out American dj products, just don't bother unless you add the 2 week repair time in."
1,OH no,alright another metalica album and at 91.99 I think I could spend my money wiser somewhere else.
5,the best album in the whole f..... world,"i love it, everyone that hate is try to focus on the music instead of the snare drum, and listen to it more that once and you will find out that it's a great album"
4,Very Nice,"I was reluctant to buy this CD because I don't know any song but I'm glad I bought it. It's a wonderful collection of songs. Listening to Michael belt out ""I might even loose my heart"" is worth it. When he belts out those note it seems so easy"
5,don't miss it,"as a MB fan, this cd is a must have. Although it is an earlier work of Michael, his voice is as good as it could be. The songs are not so familiar and popular, but that's why you should have it!"
2,You can do better than this book.,"For about the same the money, I would recommend purchasing the Janine Warner book, ""Dreamweaver for Dummies."" Mr. Towers was among the first to make available a Dreamweaver user's guide. However, being first is not always the same as being best. This QuickStart Guide is largely a recapitulation of the Dreamweaver help files. An expert user would find such a book to be superfluous, while a novice would need better prose to help them understand the concepts. Of course, the best book available on this subject is the Dreamweaver Bible. The DW Bible is well written and comprehensive. Worth the extra money."
5,Catalogue of Pre-Revival Appalachian Dulcimers,This book is a classic work on early dulcimers in the United States. It is an extremely valuable book for all those interested in the history of music in the area now known as Appalacia!
4,Another lovely effort from this group...,"While this understandably is not as good as their earlier works, this album is still wonderful. My personal favorite is track 7, writtin by Julie Miller and originally performed by her as a duet with Emmylous Harris.Still full of the lush harmonies that Selah is known for, and a wonderful soundtrack to an afternoon."
5,Great music,"Heard an early release of this newest album. If you are a Selah fan or general fan of Christian music, this album will be a must have! Great new songs along with fantastic performances by some ""guest artists"". Something for everyone! Selah continues to evolve their music so that it stays current yet provides the hallmark Selah sound that we love!"
5,Selah CD,Fabulous CD...liked by old and young in our home! The Selah flavor we love adding a twist with the duets!
4,Selah Bless the Broken Road,I've almost worn out my CD already. I want to listen to it over and over. It makes me feel good.
4,Inspiring,"Enjoyed this Cd. Purchased this cd solely for the song Bless the broken road, but the other songs were nice as well. Bless the broken road was very inspiring. It helped me realize that there is a reason for everything we go through and that despite our trials God has something better in store for us."
5,OH MAN!!,"I was just a kid, about 8 years old when I first heard this song in Mexico, I had no idea what the guy was saying at the time and I kept singing along ""changoline"" instead of Jungle life but it was all good and that song was a part of my child hood and I get the teary eye from wonderful memories, this song was known all over the world, I'm still a big fan of 80's music even though I was a kid on that decade, 80's music I think was more fun than the ones today, that's what it was, all out fun music, now it's all about violence, times change ofcourse but 80's music will always be played may be not on the radio but in some house somewhere."
4,"Playful, funny, but moderately disjointed","This is less an album, than a collection of individually inspired, while collectively confusing, diddies(?), perhaps. The first song alone is worth the purchase price, and there are treasures to be found after it, but it doesn't flow in a coherent order, and the stylistic changes are bound to jostle the casual listener. I bought the album at, what I believe to be the band's debut, the International Pop Overthrow (IPO) festival, and was well pleased with their live performance. I look forward to future releases, perhaps with the HomeTown Buffet Bee Song? Buy this cd without hesitation, but play it with remote control in hand."
4,Business Card Case,This case met my expectations. It was delivered on time. I would purchase a product from this vendor again.
5,Made the fence setup EASY,"Pound this baby into the ground, and you are literally grounded perfectly. Easy to use, easy to setup, a perfect addition to your electric fence."
2,Ground Rod,"This was purchased along with a portable Alternator. when we tried to install the ground rod, we discovered that the ground in our area is quite hard. this rod is 3/8 inch diameter and absolutely was destroyed while trying to drive it into the ground. It is in our situation a gross waist of money and time. You decide if you would take the chance of the same happening to you with this 3/8"" rod. jwh"
5,So much fun to read,I enjoyed this book immensely and have bought additional copies for gifts. It was a charming read. I keep it bedside for a good laugh when I want one.
2,Disorganized,It's really not my type of book. It was required reading for class. I think it was trying to get at some ideas like field vision and systems theory. I found more substantial info in dalai's books. I think it was called seven ways of Buddhism.
5,Science of the Invisible,"I had a migraine for three days reading this in 1990. Since then I've struggled to find a way to apply this knowledge to improve organizations. Well, I finally found it. This is the the science of culture. Self-organization, strange attractors, emergence, nonlinear interactions of agents in a system, sensitivity to initial conditions, fractals . . . and so on, are much easier to apprehend with a view of organization as organisms, and even easier to see as the underlying science of the intangible dimension of organizations. We all owe a special debt to Meg Wheatley for her pioneering work in this area . . .also readSuperperformance"
3,"""Science - y "" for the Science Type","Leadership and the New Science is a hard read unless you are the science type. Each chapter starts out like an introduction to evolution, but the ending (the part that you can actually conprehend) is very thought-provoking."
1,Curiously overrated: read a classic instead,"Bottom line: this is a populistic and skewed summary of popular books for an audience interested in personal development. Other reviewers have commented on that eloquently and in much detail. They are right: don't waste our time.Leaders who like to discover what the concept of interdependent co-origination has to offer for their succes, I refer to any Zen classic, and preferably to Shunryu Suzuki's Zen Mind -Beginners Mind, or Dainin Katagiri's Each Moment is the Universe. Read, start observing your own mind, and practice a pure form of meditation.Readers interested in the New Science: better check Ervin Laszlo: Science and the Akashik Field (2007), James Gleick: Chaos (1987), or any Feynman book on your shelf."
4,"Challening, Accessible and Interesting","This book is challenging, yet accessible, even if the reader does not posses a scientific background. While Wheatley's observations about organizations and their problems are not unique to her, her approach is, and provides an interesting framework to approach organizational development and design."
3,where the rubber meets the air,"Her original version of this book in 1992? was breath of fresh air, even 'groundbreaking'. This version continues on, but does not share anything practical she has learned in the 8 years. Maybe we are supposed to hire her consulting firm?This lack of application, and her increasing hubris [I'm right, other social scientists are not] bothered me as I progressed through the book. By the end, her subtle bragging and 'new age' wanderings had totally turned me off.I used to recommend this book to frineds and clients, but will no longer do so."
1,yuck,"hard to follow, not reader-friendly - only got it because it was required reading for one of my classes. did not like it"
2,Had to,I had to buy this book. Not a subject matter I was planning on doing this year. But it was assigned. Others might enjoy it. Not me
2,Another bus. book stretch with a psuedo-intellectual twist,"Pop business babble that cloaks itself in pretty conceptual constructs but offers few practical insights. The author often over-reaches in her attempts to bend notions of leadership to fit within the book's high-minded framework. LATNS, like many popular business books, offers a few intriguing ideas but ultimately fails to achieve relevance."
3,"Interesting, but...","The author attempts to apply the notions of chaotic systems, fractals, non-linear systems to organizations, management and leadership.The author offers very interesting analogies and intuition to support her ideas. This is clearly a thoughtful book. And maybe someday some of the very interesting ideas expressed here will be known to have been insightful.However, analogies and intuition are seldom compelling enough to ""make the case,"" and such is the case here.If you're into organizational theory and things like that, then you will probably want this book on your ""to read"" list. If you're into non-linear systems and have wondered if/how they might be part of our organizations (workplace, etc.), then you would probably find the analogies interesting.This book is a worthwhile read for the analogies. I thought they were really interesting."
1,bad for business,"As a leader, this book was recommended to me as a great tool in understanding change as it related to my organization. This book provided absolutely no insight as to how I may effectively lead, or change my organization. I am very dissapointed and will not recommend this book."
1,What science??,"First off, the author is not a scientist. Second, the author tries to link PHYSICAL science with human leadership. I only read 1/4 of the book, and I had to put it into trash because I felt like barfing everytime I lay my eyes on it. If you think a non-scientist has any right to write a book with ""New Science"" on its title, then you should buy this book. Otherwise, stay away from this LSD induced junk."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I ordered this DVD for my toddler because that is his favorite series. When it arrived, I took it out of the packaging and when I took the clear wrapping off and opened the box IT WAS EMPTY. I became very upset, especially because my son was very excited to watch it. SUCH A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
4,Such a fun gift!,"I love the idea of having large head shots of family for our precious granddaughter as she is now recognizing faces. So I am excited about giving this to her for Christmas. What would be perfect would be if the plastic openings were made for either a 4x6 or a 5x7. It is somewhere in between - which meant that I had to order 5x7s and then cut them down to fit the opening. A 4x6 would have left too much unused space. Other than that, what a fun, special gift."
4,Perfect,"This little album is going to be a perfect gift for my 8mth grand-daughter. Her family is spread far and wide over the USA, so this gives us a way to show her the grand parents aunts and uncles that love her so much on a regular basis. It does have a plastic film over the back mirror that needs to be removed so that your reflection is a little better!"
4,Cute,Gave this to our niece as she is going to be living abroad for a few years and thought it was a good way for her to have her own photo album of family. I don't know how she likes it/uses it yet (she's only 2 months) but I thought it was durable and well made.
3,Overpriced Album,"I was thrilled to fill the album with family pics for my overseas granddaughter. But the cheap quality of this item did not justify the pricetag. The plastic pages were wrinkled, and made it harder to see the pictures.I needed to send it for her birthday- without the rush, I probably would have returned it. Who knows what my granddaughter will do with it- It's meant as a plaything, and I want her to become familiar with our faces. But for $12, this should have been in better condition."
4,Pretty Good Toilet Fodder,This book is good for when you are sitting on the potty and you want to check out some pics of your family.
3,"Does the job, but quality wasn't as expected","I liked the idea of the last page being a ""mirror"" for our babies to look at. That feature is nice, but the rest of the book is lower quality than I had hoped for. The plastic makes the pictures look somewhat cloudy."
2,Ok for what it is,Cute on the outside but the inside is just plain clear filmsy pages like a normal cheap photo album you get at a drug store. From the photo is seemed it might be more plush inside like pages from a true baby's book.I bought two as gifts to fill with pics and give as baby shower gifts to a close friend and family member. But now will have to rethink since the album isn't as nice as I was expecting.
5,Great Gift!!,"I purchased this as a gift for a 9 month old for Christmas. I went on Facebook and saved fun pictures of people involved in her life and cute photos of her and the family. I used fun (free) boarders through Walgreens.com and had them printed out at my nearby store. The total for the photos was about $3. This holds 17 photos which is great so no one was left out!! When she ""opened it"" at Christmas the whole family loved seeing the photos old and new of everyone!! She very much enjoyed playing with the book too!! The cloth on the pages made it easy for her to turn them herself!! It was a very reasonably priced gift that was very personal!!!Take Care,Ariane"
2,I wish I had not purchased it,"Before purchasing the book for my grandaughter, I read the reviews. I wondered about the comments that the plastic pages were wrinkly, but hoped the one I would receive would be better. It was not. I would not recommend this book - it is overpriced and the wrinkled pages do not make the pictures clear."
2,Cheaply made for the price,The idea of this is fantastic- but the actual item is poorly made with really cheap materials. I read the reviews and decided I didn't care- the plastic the holds the photos is really shotty and sticks to every picture- like you put in in a hot car and let it melt- but it did not- it's just cheap. I think the idea of this and the number of photo pages is amazing- it's too bad they charge $14.95 for something that clearly cost .$50 or less to be made in some third world country. I am using it anyway- but wish I had paid 1/10th of what I did.
5,Toddler getting to know his family,I purchased this book for my son's first birthday and filled it full of pictures of his cousins grandparents siblings etc. you can put pics on the front and back of the page and there are quite a few pages (10 I think??). The exterior is durable and cute. Overall it has held its form really well. The plastic pages haven't gotten crinkled and he's had it for a year and looks at it all the time. The mirror page in the back is terrible quality but its not a big deal. Thinking of buying another book for more pics of friends and playmates. Happy with this purchase!
3,Good product,Purchased this to put photos of my baby niece. The product is good overall. Not the best quality but definitely good value.
5,Awesome!,My eight month old absolutely adores this album! She is constantly looking at all the pictures! Very easy for her to turn the pages. Yet the pictures are very secure so I don't have to worry bout her taking them out ;) Also she enjoys the mirror-
3,Best available,"I purchased this for a new grandchild. I had previously purchased another soft cover photo album for each of my other grandchildren but that model was no longer available. I was disappointed there was no place to personalize the album and the large ""mirror"" at the back of the book was a little overpowering. Other than that, the product will serve its purpose. The soft cover is safe and the photo pages will protect the images provided by the family."
3,Mediocre,"I like the number of pages this book contains (15), and the mirror at the end. The overall quality is poor, however."
1,Falling apart,"As soon as I received the book, there were strings hanging everywhere. I managed to trim them down and put some pictures in anyway. A week later, the plastic infront of the pictures had started to crack and there were still strings everywhere. My son enjoyed looking at the pictures, but I couldn't leave him alone with the book because I kept thinking he would choke on a part from it."
5,Family album,Such a great book for putting in your own pictures. Especially nice for families whose relatives live far away from the baby. Baby can see family members reading this book
2,Chintzy,"The pages are plastic with a 1/4"" fabric border. The plastic is wrinkly and the pages stick together. The ""see me"" mirror does not live up to its description, as one cannot see oneself in it; it's like looking at the dull side of aluminum foil. On the cover the blue ink came out very dark so that the bear's facial features were barely visible. I had been excited to give this album to my daughter, who has enough faraway relatives to fill 15 pages, but it was just not nice enough and I felt compelled to return it. Now I have to start all over looking for an album with a lot of pages."
3,baby's first photo album,"This was good. The pages inside are plastic which is good for keeping pictures safe, but the plastic was wrinkled possible during shipping so they pictures are not as clear as I would like them. Also the pages could fit a picture larger than 4x6, so it left some see through space around my pictures. Overall though I like the book. I think the mirror at the end is great."
1,disappointed,the quality of the picture pages is very poor. the pages stick together and don't look good at all.
3,Decent for the price,"Pros: nice that it holds so many photosCloth cover is nicePages are secure, so baby can chew on them without harming photosCons: very difficult to insert photosSee plastic around edges of 4x6 photo -- so doesn't look terrificPlastic bubbles around picturesKind of cheap lookingSo, overall, this does the trick, but is not terrific."
5,Incredible,"I must say that this cd has helped me through a lot, and i am eternally grateful that such amazingly beautiful music exists. Now i am aware that this review is slightly biased, so i must say that it is a very solid first debut. I can only hope that they keep maturing and pumping out music. Oh and kevin, im onto you."
2,Not warm enough for me,"I didn't find that the infrared heat was sufficient for my sore neck. Maybe it's ""dumbed down"" to keep people from burning themselves. The vibration is a mild buzzing. And the attachment fingers, etc are not much use. Frankly, this didn't help my muscles at all."
3,Good massage feel.. but heat is almost non existent,"This massager has some good settings and feels good along your back. However, the heat setting is just anemic. I would say ""lukewarm"" is an appropriate description of the heat. It is a nice touch that the surface of the skin contact areas illuminates a bright red to indicate the heat feature is active, as weak a it is."
3,did anyone have a problem with this unit not being sturdy,did i put it together wrong? my unit is not sturdy and this unit has so many great remarks
5,Best kitchen appliance I've purchased in a LONG time!,"We have yet to use our George Foreman GGR50B Grill outdoors, but we use it at least twice a week for indoor cooking. I have not cooked a bad meal on it yet (which is saying something!) and the clean-up is fairly easy. My son also owns one and probably uses his as much, if not more, than we do. A great product. I say BUY IT!"
5,Great grill for apartment use!,I got this grill for my college aged son who lives in an apartment for Christmas. They do not have a balconey or patio so a charcoal or propane grill is out of the question. He absolutely loves this grill! He says it works great and clean up is very easy. They now can enjoy grilled food! Would highly recommend this grill for those people who cannot have a charcoal or gas grill.
4,Hot,Very hot for a electric grill. Easy to clean. Good grill for condo where you cannot use gas. You will not go wrong with this grill.
2,Be sure to learn the grill's capabilities,"The George Foreman grill is well made, easily assembled and worked well. We have always used charcoal grills and gas grills with briquets. If you think the Foreman grill will give you anything close to these flavors, forget it. There is no flavor imparted to the meat since you are basically cooking on a slab of metal. Hamburgers tasted awful and we only used it twice and gave it away. The point is, don't expect any flavor enhancement to your cooking."
5,Way to go George !,"I had already purchased the smallest George Foreman grill and loved it. My NEW George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor grill is GREAT. My 8 year old assembled the grill- it's that easy! The only problem that I have is with the lid. The lid is not attached and although there is a way to hang the lid on the side of the grill, it isn't very practical and the food is hard to get to that way. You have to hold on to the lid or set it down somewhere to tend to the food. One minor glitch in an otherwise sensational grill. I am so impressed with this grill, that I bought another one as a gift for my Mom! Thanks George!!"
5,Foreman passes condo restrictions,If you have a outdoor patio in a condo unit outdoor grilling is restricted or prohibited. Gas and open flames.... Forman is electric and outside grilling is ok. One of our homes is in Chicago and we have 10 months of bad weather. No problem we use this grill inside with the fan on and it doesn't set off our smoke detectors.. We have 3 houses and everyone has this grill.
5,Foreman does it again!,This electric grill was the perfect solution for our small condo balcony. Very easy to put together and very easy to use. And we love how it grills. The price was perfect too.
4,George Foreman Grill,"Nice looking grill, easy to put together. It's not the same as a real charcoal or gas grill though. I like that it's easy to clean and the fat has a place to go that is also easy to clean. Other grills have the grease things underneath and that's a pain to get to. The grill cooked my chicken really fast and it was good. For the money it's worth getting."
3,good one ..with lil defects,"its a good product,but when i washed for the first time only the black coated layer got scrapped ..i dont know whether its for every product or only this.??.is it ok to use that?if anybody had the same case plz let me know.grilling is nice..i had a small balcony n i grill there..it tastes good too."
2,Too wobbly,"Although the food cooked nicely, I felt the grill was too wobbly. You almost need 3 hands to cook your food -- one to hold the lid, one to flip food and one to hold the grill. I also did not think it got rid of as much grease as the grills in which the lid actually presses the food. I returned the grill for the George Foreman family size grill."
3,Easy to clean but cooks slow,"It's ok, but last time I had a party of eight, and most of time, everyone is just waiting for the next round of food."
4,"A Great Grill, But Don't Expect BBQ Flavor","I've used this grill for about a month now and cooked everything from meat to fish to veggies. It gets quite hot, although it won't produce a sear. The food cooks evenly and retains moisture. Quite a good grill if you don't expect charcoal or gas type cooking."
4,Practically Perfect...,"The grill works great for most things - especially veggies and prawns. The one thing that it doesn't work that great for is roasting peppers - even on the highest setting it doesn't blacken the flesh of the peppers. That being said, it is the perfect size for the balcony and is very simple to use."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I can only figure that the reviews on this grill were written by George himself. Or somebody that works for thr company.The grill does heat up fast and abide by most condo law, but the good points stop there. The grill does not drain very well. Most food is boiled or fried in it's own grease unless you tilt the grill in numerous directions while cooking. Not recommended! Grilled food is not bad, but in no way compares to taste of gas or charcoal grill. Cleanup is not as easy as expected unless you hose it off in the yard with a high pressure nozzle. Grill surface is too large to fit in most sinks for cleaning. Nonstick coating is pretty good at not sticking to grill surface. After a few months of use it will start to come off while cleaning. I'm back to violating my condo bylaws. It's worth being a condo criminal to have a real grill instead of an expensive hotplate."
5,Jim's Grill,"I'm very pleased with this grill, I have already used it 4 times with great results. The best feature is how easy it is to clean. No scrubbing is needed,Just wipe it down with a damp cloth or paper towels, or even just hose it down with the water hose. I have the electric version and even use it on my enclosed porch."
4,The ending result is great but the product manufacturing wise is cheap,"This is a great grill; I have an apartment and since propane is not allowed, it is great to know electric grills are an option.I cooked burgers on it last night and it was grilled just like a propane grill would.- I am not happy about the quality of the manufacturing. The instructions are poor visually. It is not difficult at all to put together, but there is a piece that separates one pole from another and I still cannot tell If I have it put together right.- What I mean by that is if I want to move it, I have to pick it up by the bottom pole and move it then instead of using the grips.I gave it 4 stars.I hope the review helps people."
3,Indoor/Outdoor Grill,"The grill is good for grilling mostly vegetables. I would not recommend using it to grill food that require higher heat. I find that it does not cook evenly. Also, I would not recommend using it indoor because it sometime is gets smoky"
5,George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor Grill,"George Foreman GGR50B Indoor/Outdoor GrillI received the George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor Grill when it originally came out a few years ago. Moving from an upstairs apartment to a condominium, I cannot tell you how great it is, easy to clean, and can be stored/used outside in the winter months with a heavy-duty garbage bag tied at the bottom for easy access. This BBQ grill has lasted longer than any gas grill I've ever owned and is easy to maintain. The only problem I've had is losing the book when I moved...."
3,good product but not excellent,A very good product as an electric grill but can not replace a gas grill.Definitely #1 choice if you are looking for an electric one.
5,GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL IS GREAT!!!!,"THIS GRILL IS GREAT. I LOVE IT . I HAVE FOUR NOW.TWO AT OUR BEACH HOUSE AT EMERALD ISLE N.C. I LOVE TO COOK ON THEM. I LIKE THE WAY THE FOOD TASTE AND IT IS HEALTHY. VERY EASY CLEAN UP. GLAD I WAS ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER ONE. LOVE IT ,LOVE IT, LOVE IT."
4,george you did it again bravo,with limited space on the porch where i live this is great if it rains i just bring it in and plug it up. love it
5,george foreman grill,"Very convenient. Since I live in the western mountains, (snow, wind, cold), being able to grill indoors works well. The temperature control on the grill enables me to cook a larger variety of items. Clean up is easy."
2,Not worth the effort,"I guess the old adage is true, you get what you pay for! The unit is not as sturdy as I had thought, and the plate is a real pain to clean. But, it does cook food as advertised, but the actual cooking space is limited."
3,Bar B Que,This grill works very well and I can cook indoors with it during the winter so that is nice. It is designed well having the grease flow into a trap. You don't get the good grilled flavor like you would on a gas grill or charcoal grill but for what it was designed to do it does it well.
5,A Real Grill,"Several years ago we purchased the original GF grill (the one with the press-down lid). It was more a panini grill, we did not like it, and we immediately returned it.This one, however, is a real grill. We've cooked everything on it that we typically do with our outdoor Weber grill in the summer months.- kebab skewers- chicken breasts- hamburgers- salmon- tuna... etc.It's perfect. It's big enough to lay a whole side of salmon on one half, and several chicken breasts on the other. The lid is really important, helping to retain the moisture of the items cooking, with minimal fumes/smoke released. And I really like that the grill seperates easily from the base. I store it in a corner on the base, and I lift it off and place it on the counter when I use it.Cleans up relatively easily too!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,A grill without a grate,"After eagerly anticipating using this new grill, I was disappointed to find a grill pan rather than a grate as the cooking surface. A big grill pan, but still... That, along with the composition - some kind of plastic, not metal - of the top and bottom, I decided this was not for me. Back to the stove-top grill pan, I guess. Impressive size, though, as you'd expect from Foreman. I'm returning it and thank Amazon for making the process so easy."
4,grill works,This grill was purchased for the office. Only used it once so far. Made hot dogs. They were very good. Cleaned up easily. The only con was that it heated up too slowly. the price was right and product arrived speedily.
5,Cookin Good,"I have had charcol and propane and this grill is just as good, cooks the dogs and hamburgers any way you want, the heat is ajustable for anything. electric coil heats up very fast. If you want electric BBQ this grill Rocks."
3,Grill,"Satisfactory performance but I had hoped for better. Often, by the time meat is browned on the outside, it's dry or tough on the inside, from draining all the juices out. Better is meat is partially cooked in a microwave and then finished on the grill. Sits well on my stovetop as well as outside on the stand but caution because the unit comes off the stand easily; have to pick up by the stand to move it on the porch. Heating element (cord) is cumbersome and 90-degree angle makes to a bit awkward. Good for steaks, less satisfactory for pork or chicken. I do use it year-round and for an apartment, it's OK to use on the porch. Bought it because charcoal and gas models forbidden. Unfortunately, it is marginally less satisfactory than broiling in the oven; actually takes longer to cook. Caution: use at least 16AWG heavy guage extension cord and make sure outlet is 15 amps with no other load on it. Cord and outlet get very hot!"
1,Total power [drain],"I don't get it. I bought this grill based on the reviews that I read here. Don't get this if you want flavorful food. Yuk. But more angering is the fact that this behemoth requires industrial amounts of electricity. I have a brand-new house - with brand-new wiring - but this clunker trips the breaker on every outlet (inside & out) that I try. I now have a ...white elephant sitting on my deck. Sorry George, looks like you'll be part of my Spring garage sale. I'm going back to good tasting, true-grilled chops and burgers on my gas grill."
1,Grill vs. Griddle,"Well, I have always been a gas grill girl. (Even shoveled a path to my grill in the snowy months). I have recently moved to an apartment complex where I cannot have a gas grill (too dangerous for community life). So I purchased the largest George Foreman grill from Amazon that I could. I have come to realize that if you have never had a gas grill you will probably love your George Foreman. If you are a real GRILL person you will consider this lilke I do, A GRIDDLE WITH GROOVES. HATE IT!!! Your broiler on your oven will probably work better. My advice unitl you can grill again, crock pot or stir fry. Try pancakes or bacon on George Foreman, that is what it is made for. If you must buy this product, it is OK for beef, very bad for chicken cutlets!!!"
4,george is great but...................,"We love our george,there are two minor problems with it and one is it seems to be a little tippy on the pedestal.IT sure holds a lot more than the table top ones but you need to turn everything over unlike the smaller ones that the top closes down on what you are cooking.Overall we love it because it cooks fantastic and does have room even for a roast or a whole chicken."
4,George Foreman Outdoor Grill,I like the convenience and size of this grill very much. Only negative comment is that the pedestal could be more stable. So far I have had no problems at all and use regularly.
5,Amazing!!!!!,I love this grill! It holds a lot more than the regular size forman grill and it's very easy to clean!!!!
5,Indoor/Outdoor Grill.,"I have used the Grill several times...cooking steaks, kebabs and grilling flat breads. I have been more than pleased with the grill and the ease of cleanup. Best of all, the end product....Grilled Meats and Vegetables have been fantastic!"
5,love this grill,"I love this grill so much. Very easy to use, very easy to clean, and whatever you are fixing on it turns out great."
4,Great Grill!,"I got this grill as a wedding present, and it's been one of my favorite gifts! It is light and easy to move, and I love that we can keep it outdoors. It's great for condos or apartments were gas/coal grills are not allowed. It heats up very fast, and the cooking surface is large enough to accommodate a lot of food at once - no more grilling 2 burgers at a time on our old mini- Foreman! I really like that it comes apart for easy storage, so we can tuck it away during the winter. Like all George Foremans it's a little bit of a pain to clean (I wish it came with one of those plastic scrapers), but definitely worth getting!"
4,Grill was damaged when I received,"Unfortunately the lid of the grill was damaged when it arrived and I did not receive the utensils which were supposed to be included. I did contact the suppler but to date I have not received either. Otherwise, I like the grill very much. Although I don't think it would grill a steak very well, it is great for fish, chicken, burgers, dogs,veggies etc. and is perfect for our balcony. I probably wouldn't order online again after this experience."
4,Great George Foreman grill,"I have used this grill in my covered porch a couple of times since I bought it. I did not use the stand as I have placed this on top of a table which is near an outlet. I love the size of this grill as I can grill meat on one side and vegetables on the other for 2 people. (Make sure you put the vegetables later so you don't overcook the veg.)Once the meat is cooked you can leave it on the grill and reduce the heat to 2 or 3 to keep warm or just turn it off. I used to own 2 gas grills and a charcoal one before and find that the George Foreman electric grill is just the right one for me. I would highly recommend people to get this grill if you don't have much space in your porch and get the plastic cover if the grill is outdoor, just don't forget to remove the cord from the outlet and the grill. Cleaning the grill is easy and bec. it is non-stick, food residues are easily removed using a sponge."
2,doesn't get hot enough,The grill looks great and is easy to assemble. The instructions for use are easy to understand. Unfortunately the grill doesn't get hot enough to sear the meat even when preheated for quite some time.
4,"79 bucks, cant beat it....","Bought one for $79.00 and satified. Easy to assemble, stand is sturdy, lid fits snug with no movement and works great in and outside. A few cosmetic defects, plastic handle has a bubble from factiry sort of thing, but no affect to performance. Bought the cover and sponges for just under a $100. Great if you live in an apartment 2nd floor or higher. Like that you can remove the grill from the stand to use on counter. Cleaning is easy and it cooks my burgers and steaks fully. 4 stars because nothing beats a real grill and cosmetic defects."
4,"Easy handling, assembly and smartly priced","George has done it again!! If short on indoor space, leave assembled outdoors. So far just grilled chicken legs; easy and delicious. Saved $$ less than BJ's price. Love it!! Wish it were on wheels!!"
4,Good grill,I bought this grill for my parents to replace their old Foreman grill (power cord went bad after several years). It was disappointing that the handle detached from the lid within a week after purchase. Overall the grill is adequate for their purposes and I hope the handle issue is not indicative of an overall lack of quality in the product.
3,Okay...but use care.,"Good grill, but don't drop the lid.... the handle is VERY fragile and will shatter into pieces. They need to make the top plastic components out of a harder material."
3,Good taste BUT it's a cheap grill,"Don't expect too much from this grill- although the food is really good- all of it does taste ""grilled"" and I'm pretty satisfied with the buy, but the cons are those: it's a wobbly grill, and it's well, easy to clean, sort of - but a bit careful clean because it's an electric grill. Overall it's a decent machine but it's not THE grill. I'm sure there are better ones out there. It's a decent priced buy."
4,EXCELLENT!!,"I use this indoors all the time, for grilling anything you'd grill on an outdoor grill. It conveniently sits on the stand in a corner of the kitchen (it's much too big to store in a cupboard!) and is ready to go anytime I get the urge to grill something. I use with with the lid (for things that need to cook longer like roasts) and with the cover off for steaks and chops. Grilled veggies like zuchini ...WONDERFUL!I haven't had it long enough to try a multitude of items, but I think this is going be be a good friend of mine for years to come!Did I mention that with the no stick surface (I usually spray with non stick olive oil spray as well) it cleans up in seconds?? Can't beat the price either. If the stand were a bit more stable (it does wobble a bit if 'hit', and wouldn't trust it with pets or small children about) I would give it 5 stars.If you're at all tempted and have the room for it (it's quite large and cooks MANY steaks and chops all at once) buy it...you WON'T be sorry!"
5,The best grill on the market,My husband and I bought the George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor grill just a month ago after extensive research on all kinds of grills. We honestly think this is the best grill ever. So simple to use and cleaning up is too easy. No spills or greasy mess. I would recommend this product to those who have a passion for barbaqueing.
1,I Should Have Purchased The Smaller Version !,"6-25-10 TOO BIG,Should Have Bought The Smaller Version(200sq.in.)Difficult To Carry & Clean This Larger Size.AND Carry & Clean Is What You'll Be Doing,Each Time You Use It! I Have A Large Utility Sink In My Garage & The Grill Plate Barely Fits In It.I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Don't even think about it, no support from manufacture!","Not even worth one star but you have to give it something to write a review. My vote? ZORE STARS!!! I purchased this product base off of the reputation of the George Foreman product line. Who will ever know if it was even worth the purchase. I bought this item from a company that was closing its doors so all sales final. Got the item home, unboxed and found a piece of the base broken. I called the company and requested a new base and was informed that it was on back order and should be available in 30-60 days. So I waited and waited, did not receive it, called again and got the same story. Now being more than a year later and the company not even attempting to even support this product I have just put it out with the garbage. I will never by another George Foreman or Salton (Manufacture of product) product. What a way to treat a long time customer."
3,ITS NOT TOO BAD,"WE HAVEN'T USED THE GRILL YET, BUT THE STAND IS NOT AS STURDY AS I EXPECTED. THE POLE INSERT INTO THE BASE AND GRILL IS LOOSE AT EACH END, SO BE PREPARED TO USE SOME DUCT TAPE OR FILLER OF SOME SORT TO STABILIZE IT. STILL A GREAT PRICE FOR THIS TYPE OF ITEM, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO DO A LITTLE TRIAGE ON IT."
3,Couldn't find replacement for heating element.,"I enjoyed this grill and found it great for hamburgers, fish, steak etc. However, I left it on one night and the heating element burned out. I have looked for a replacement and can't find. It should have an override shut off before it burns out. I don't think I will waste my money. It was not quite as sturdy as I would have liked."
3,Thought I had lost my mind!,"Bought this grill on the advice of a friend as well as the reviews for our vacation house - took the unopened box up there to put it together. Everything was fine until I tried to attach the knob to the top - NO THREADS - I thought there was something wrong with me that I couldn't figure it out. Naturally it was a weekend and no help via telephone.Later the following week I called and a replacement knob was sent which arrived within two weeks. SO, still can't review since we haven't tried it yet!!"
5,I love it!,I love this little grill. Although it really performs like one of the big grills. It heats up very quickly and is easy to clean afterwards. The surface is large enough to cook for the whole family and it cooks evenly for the entire surface. Good job George!
4,George Foreman indoor/outdoor grille GGR50B,"product was easy to assemble and found it to be very stable as opposed to several reviews which said it was wobbly. first time use cooked chicken and burgers together, grille surface is nice sized which allowed this with no spillover. cooked food thoroughly, grease drained away to drip pan, it is a pain to clean though because of size, but overall very satisfied."
3,"Not bad, but do not expect much","This grill is OK if you're going to make a chicken, burgers or vegetables. It is well made and very handy if your landlord does not allow a propane/charcoal grills. But because of its limited power it just not getting hot enough to sear the steak right - so forget about steakhouse quality, all you can get is a look-like-real (pink inside and striped outside), but dry piece of beef - no juicy steak there."
2,"not hot enough, take a long time to heat up","i bought it from reading such good reviews, but the problem is that it does not get hot enough, it takes a long time to heat up."
5,George Foreman Outdoor Grill,"We were very surprised to find that this electric grill surpassed our expections. It not only grilled the usual hamburgers, vegetables, fish, & chicken, it is great for ribs and steaks, with a very easy clean up. We recommended it to friends and after seeing it for themselves, they bought one (5 so far). Easy assembly and easy clean up. Doesn't get any better than that."
5,"Convenient, easy grill","We live in an apt building that doesn't allow charcoal or gas grills. We plug this electric grill into an outlet on our patio and it's simple to use. It heats up quickly, and steaks are done in under 30 minutes. It takes up little space but we could easily cook 2 filets and 4 chicken skewers. You do have to clean it fairly often as it catches excess fat in a tray, but it's easily done with some soap and water."
3,Hard to wash.,"This would be perfect if George Foreman came along with it to help me clean the huge and heavy parts. Well, if I had a big utility sink that would do the trick, but I made a mess of my kitchen counters and floor trying to get it clean. Cooks very well, however."
4,Excellent quality electric grille,"We bought the GGR50B to use for infrequent grilling of steaks and burgers. The unit is very well made and assembled very easily. We recommend following the instructions when grilling steaks - do not flip them frequently. They grille better if you leave them on each side longer than you would on a gas grille.The heat distribution is very good, allowing even cooking on the majority of the surface.It is a bit inconvenient to remove the entire cooking surface for cleaning since it is fairly large and cumbersome to clean. The cooking surface DOES clean easily, it's just kind of bulky to fit into the kitchen sink to clean it."
4,Nearly Perfect,"Lots of reviews already, so let's not waste your time:Pros:- easy to setup (no waiting for charcoal or having to buy propane)- easy to clean- practical. U can use it indoor/outdoor- No flames, so it's quite hard to actually burn the foodCons:- Doesn't cook the food 100% evenly. Noticed that the area around the thermostat is hotter. Not by much though, but you can notice the grill marks on the food stronger when near the thermostat- Doesn't get really really hot. If you're trying to cook Brazilian style (large chunk of meat), it might not work out. However, it's great if you cut it into smaller chunks of meat.Overall:I love this so much that some days I use this for lunch and for dinner. There are no pans to clean. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's not even throughout the whole plate."
2,Not a real grill.,"Imagine a big electric skillet with grooves. That's exactly what this is. Chicken is the worst on it, plus meat sticks. Don't buy this."
4,Excellent grill but dented,The grill is very easy to use and it's at a convenient height. We have had some excellent results from the meals on the grill. The only problem at all is when we unpacked the grill the lid was dented. The dent is about the size of a softball. I notified the manufactured by e-mail when I unpacked it. So far there has been no response.
1,big disappointment,The grill in no way duplicates a regular outdoor grill either gas or charcol. The heating element does not get hot enough to brown sufficiently. I might as well use my oven broiler. I dropped the top which often happens when you are out of doors and the plastic handle broke which makes it almost useless because without the handle it will be difficult to remove the top to check what is cooking.
2,Disappointed,It's a very nice grill but I wasn't happy with it probably because it came with no instructions on how to cook different things & at what temperatures.I am now looking at the new Cuisinart grill that I saw advertised on TV
5,"Way to go, George!","This is a cool grill. And so easy to clean! After dinner, I just tell my girlfriend ""Clean the grill, honey"", and it's done! But be careful, the hood can get very hot when the grill is on high. My girlfriend's cat jumped on it from the nearby countertop. Ouch! It singed the hairs on her little paws. Oh well, at least it taught that little feline a lesson."
1,NO ELECTRIC CORD!,After reading all these great reviews I was super excited to be buying the grill. Got it at a great price and it definately looks nice and sturdy. The only problem is that THERE WAS NO ELECTRIC PROBE in the package!!!! I reached out to the manufacturer but no luck!!!!....Ahhhhh soooooo dissapointed!
3,Disappointed George Forman Indoor/Outdoor Grill,"this grill was a disappointment. The actual cooking top is 17"" although from the description it appears to be 22"". Our original Forman grill was 22"". This grill is less sturdy.Generally the quality is not as good."
5,Fire it up!,"I ordered this from esalton because Amazon couldn't get this to me in a timely manner. I usually only order from Amazon, so I felt like I was taking a chance. But shipping from esalton was fast and free! Great product. I put this together in less than 5 minutes! High quality. A super value for the price."
4,Impressed with grill,"In a condo community in FL, this is the perfect grill to set on the lanai, as propane grills are not allowed. It cooked our steak beautifully, so we will be using it often."
2,Ok at best,"Got this grill to avoid open flame and to keep on my deck but unlike a regular grill this CANNOT be left out on deck or used during wet weather. Had to bring it inside to cook during a rainy cookout. Also grill surface is HUGE which is good if you're cooking for 20 every time you use it. It's a bit unmanageable in an apartment for 3. Also grill did not lock onto base so it could spin while cooking which seemed dangerous. Angle of grill was not tilted so on the one I bought the grease just stayed on the surface, never fell into the cup. The plastic trays that connect to the sides are cheap and not steady so you couldn't use them for much more than the utensils. The cover is heavy and awkward. Positives: it heated up and cooked fast. I returned mine."
5,Quite Simply the Best Grill I've Ever Owned ...,"This has become one of my favorite all-time purchases ... and the fact that I got it at a ridiculously cheap price thanks to Amazon's Gold Box offer makes it even better. I was impressed at how easily it assembles (and with NO tools, mind you).It's blissfully simple and elegant, and has a large cooking surface. And it's easier to clean than the portable George Foreman models because the entire grill surface is not only non-stick but also IMMERSIBLE. I've got my grill sitting in my screened porch. I just load up the grill, close the lid and go back into the house to do something else while it works. It's oh-so-convenient and all the heat stays OUT of my kitchen.Thanks to the large domed lid, I've even used it as an oven (again, without heating up my kitchen) for roast chicken and turkey. I love, love, LOVE this grill, and you will too."
5,Grill Fits the Bil,This is the second George Foreman indoor/outdoor grill that I have purchased. I use it on a screened in porch and the compact size allows enough room for the lawn table and chairs. I just plug it in and when the grilling is done the easy clean cook surface is a big plus. It is reasonably priced and I don`t have the mess of a charcoal grill.
4,Perfect Grill for the Apartment Dweller,"This little grill is not so little, with a large grill surface, but it takes up so little space on my apartment's patio - so it is perfect for those of us who only have a small patio or balcony. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and grills perfectly - no mess, no fuss."
2,Doesn't drain at all,"I bought this from a guy who was moving and couldn't take it with him. I like the whole idea of grilling inside, so I did some research before I paid for it and liked the reviews I saw.I was quite disapointed when I cooked some hamburgers and chicken one night and the liquids did not drain at all. I tried moving the grill around just in case it needed to be adjusted and still no drain. The fat that came out of the burgers just sat there under the burgers. The chicken turned out pretty dry but I think that was partly my doing.It was easy to clean up, and it heated up very fast so I can't complain about that. However if I had wanted to fry my food I would have used the stove."
4,Meets my needs,"This George Foreman Grill meets my needs. Fits nicely on my patio and allows me to grill pork chops and steaks as well as hamburgers for myself and visitors without the hassle of charcoal, gas and flame.Package itself was easy to put together, without tools and its wt is light enough for me to move when necessary.Only problem is the cover paired with the grill for purchase is way too big for the Grill and it's cover."
5,George Foreman indoor/outdoor grilling A+++++,I was quite hesitant upon buying this because I really like the taste of bar-b-que food. Well I am pleasantly surprised at the taste of the food on this grill!!!!! I put the sauce on and all and it just comes off the grill tasting great!!!!! I made a great choice in grills here and am sure that all would be happy with the taste of the food!!! Easy clean up too.....
4,Has worked great!,"This has been a handy grill on my patio. We've all heard the health warnings - charred meat can be carcinogenic - no more charcoal and flames. Miss a little of that taste, but o.k."
5,Great grilling,The George Foreman grill is easy to use and clean. When I cook a lot of meat on it I put it in the sink and in minutes its clean without any effort. It is a pleasure to grill when the clean up is so easy. I also like the fact that all grease goes into the pan underneath the grill. All I have to do is rinse it under water and wipe and presto ready for another day.
5,The Best Grill,"This would be the ideal gift for anyone who likes to BBQ! The clean up is so easy- no mess and the food turns out great! I bought one for my husband so he could help out at dinner time and he really likes cooking the meat on it! When my kids go off to college I am going to buy each of them one to take- easy to use, no mess and easy to store! We are really enjoying it. We use it without the stand and it sits right on our kitchen counter and then when we are done I store it inside one of our kitchen cabinets!It comes with a stand to use outside too! Love The Grill!"
5,George Foreman GGR50B Indoor/Outdoor Grill,"This is a very convenient, adaptive, creative and durable grill. Outstanding for the small to average grill need."
5,The product functioned as intended,"The product functioned as intended, easy to assemble, great for condo use indoors and out, and will cook for 4 people easy!"
4,"Good grill, perfect for the city",Does its job for a great price. Was a great alternative for a third floor city condo. Wish it had hinges on the cover so it didn't need to be taken on and off all the time. Must be picked up in the middle of the base to move or else it will slide apart in your hands.
4,Very Good For Quickly Grilled Meals,This is our third grill of this type from George Forman. We have found the product to be good quality and quite serviceable with a useful life of about 5 years when used 3 to 5 times per week. Very good product.
5,perfect,my son and his friends enjoy this table so much it was very easy to assemble and the quality is great
5,I have to agree with Marc.........what a great buy!,"I'm really impressed with everything about this set.....it really does entertain. I have a daycare with the youngest being 2 and the oldest 8. Everyone plays with this. It's built nicely and at the perfect height. (Little guys can stand and walk around while the older kids can kneel and play.)Sometimes the picture is misleading and the final product turns out much smaller than you thought it would.......well, not the case with this! There is room enough for several children to play at once and plenty of accessories, people, and vehicles to go around.It was reasonably easy to put together, too, but I'd suggest you do it alone or with a second adult, rather than with 3 toddlers helping you. The table assembly is quick and easy, using only the hex driver included. The train track assembly takes the most time. Be sure to save your directions in case they take it apart.I'd recommend this for anyone with children."
3,Its ok for the price,"The set is pretty, but for the small problem that most of the wooden train tracks dont stay connected, so when they roll a train over it, the track falls or comes apart. customer service is helpful they r going to send replacement parts, so hopefully they work!"
5,Great train table and good value,"This table is perfect for what we wanted - good value, sturdy, fairly easy to assemble even the night before xmas and the grandaughter LOVES it she sits in the middle of the table and pushes the train around the track I'm not sure I recommend that - but thats what happens at our house : )you can buy this table with confidence in my opinion - We got see thru tubs for all the extra track and ""set ups"" these stack nicely in the closet and works out great for us. My Grandaughter (age 3) likes to use the table for other playtime events like legos and all her puzzles"
4,Great Fun!,This train table is great for Thomas The Train. It's just the right height for small children and it accomodates a pretty elaborate set of tracks.
2,Dull,"Didn't bother to watch it to the end. Not at all on the same level as the choices that led Amazon to recommend it to me: ""Choose Me"" (a wonderful movie that everyone should see) and ""Round Midnight"" which was also quite nice. Sometimes the recommendation system works, sometimes it doesn't!"
2,DVD,The picture quality on this DVD was terrible. I wish it had been better because it had a great cast.
1,Not Worth It,"After it soaks in the water for 30 mins, the mat is wet. My dog does not willing to lay on a wet mat. I've to hang it up and wait for it dry, but it isnt' cool after it drys. Therefore, I dont get how it works."
2,MiraCool Mat,"My dog didn't seem to like this product. She preferred the bricks of the fireplace hearth for cooling instead. However, I will try it again next summer."
5,Excellent bearings,"I had a set of Bones Reds in a skateboard I used to ride, and they were excellent. When I decided to buy a longboard, I knew I wanted to buy Bones bearings, but I wanted to step up a bit. These bearing were it, and they are amazing. They feel like riding on butter. They are so smooth and well built. For the price, they are amazing."
1,Dont believe the hype...,"I dont like leaving negative reviews, but personally I dont think these bearings are worth any more than normal bearings. I guess I got shafted, because I installed them and noticed no difference. Months later the only thing I've noticed different is that these bearings are noisy and jarring over bumps in the road.So, I'm removing them and going back to standard bearings."
4,no bones about it,These are the best bearings money can buy. You have to break them in but after that they are smooth as a whistle and ultra fast.
1,Misleading-no quantity listed! Very disappointed!!,"I just placed this order last night. We were really excited to get these bearings for this price so we ordered two. Only to find out that there are only 8 per box. 16 are needed to be complete for roller skates. Unless you blow up the picture can you see that it only has 8 in the box. How disappointing is that!! This is my first order through Amazon, it will also be my last. Since we have been mis-led about the quantity we will have to place another order (or go somewhere else) to be able to complete both sets of skates. When someone searches ""roller skate bearings"" it should have the quantity listed."
5,The best you can get besides ceramics,"Wow... when I first bought these bearings I knew what I was after. All my friends that skate and everyone I know uses Bones. No wonder it doesn't have any reviews... cause it doesn't need one. If you take good care of them and clean them once a month or so they'll last you a long time and it also depends on how often you use your board, but anyways if your looking for really good bearings for a decent price than these are the way to go."
4,What a surprise,"I thought, ""Made in 1974, not exactly a period of great movie-making, and I've never heard of this"" - but I just watched ""Once Upon a Scoundrel"" on Netflix, and I loved it. I came here to Amazon to see if I could get it on dvd, but so far, no luck.I recognized a few of the actors, notably A Martinez. The tale is incredibly witty, and some parts had me laughing until I cried. It's simply done, but that's part of its charm, and it is very charming; I'd definitely call it a ""feel good"" movie."
4,The inner gears of a cobol program,I enjoyed looking at some of the examples in this book such as the password program. Where can I get in touch with the authors? I think that this book should be re issued.
5,read before fist day of kindergarten,Helped my nervous going into kindergarten 4.5 year old. Touched all the points and got her excited about the first day.
4,A nice start in reading,This was a gift for Great grandaughter. She likes to figure the words out and is interested in reading already..
5,"Kindergarten Rocks, How Full Is Your Bucket, for kids, Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready For Kindergarten","My grandson loved all of the books and took them to school for the teacher to read. The books arrived promptly. I really appreciate your service. I especially chose these books, because my daughter is a kindergarten teacher and recommendedThe boOka. So glad you had them!"
5,Quietly Profound,"Mark Collins has a knack for drawing out of everyday life moments and experiences that are often overlooked, but once studied turn out to be deeply profound and emotional. His stories don't deal with celebrities and shipwrecks, and for that we can be thankful. Rather, they take on life's greatest challenges and dramas--losing sleep to nurse a sick child back to health, making it to work day in and day out when one would rather be irresponsible, dedication to the ones we love. Anyone with a heart will greatly appreciate this writing."
4,Paranoid android is harder then it looks,"I ordered both this book and the In Rainbows tab book at the same time. If you're trying to choose between the two, go with In Rainbows. Not only is the tabliture larger and easier to read, it also comes with music for all instruments used, where Ok Computer does not.And that guy is right, the font for tabs is pretty damn small. That doesn't really make it not worth buying, though."
3,The history of fuzzy logic,This book describes the players and the concepts behind fuzzy logic but does not give you the math and algorithms to implement your own fuzzy logic applications. More of a general interest book than a book for a software developer who wants to know the nuts and bolts behind fuzzy logic.
1,Disapointment; this is not a book on logic,"The book claims to be a introduction to fuzzy logic. Though I now know something about the development of fuzzy logic, it has not developed my understanding of fuzzy logic. This introduction is just too simplistic. It lets you think you understand, but you really do not. The book do not contain any logic at all, no proofs, no methods and no exercises. It should not be taken as a book on logic, but a book ofn the history of logic."
5,Brand New and Fast Delivery!,This piano lesson book is brand new and we received it within 3-4 days of ordering it. We appreciate the fast delivery and finding a new copy of an older book. Thank you for your fine service!
2,Fans didn't last long,"This product did exactly what it said it would do, but it didn't do it very long. The interesting thing is that it worked even when the fans died just by giving the laptop plenty of air circulation. It is not comfortable for use on the lap. I bought a 10"" mini and bought the Ucool laptop stand (also from amazon dot com) to replace this product. The new Ucool has no working parts, costs less, weighs less than a pound, sits comfortably on my lap or desk, and uses no electricity."
2,Cooler Master NotePal Laptop Cooler Too Big,"I bought it for my Dell notebook, but its way too big. I'm using it with my Dell E1505, which has a widescreen monitor, and its about the right size. It sets the keyboard at a comfortable and usable angle, and the fans are very quiet. But it doesn't do much for cooling.I haven't tried the other brands, so I cant say they are any better, but I'm disappointed with this one."
4,"For 17"" MacBook Pro","The NotePal is probably the best laptop cooler I've used so far. It's well built and attractive, matching my MacBook's metal finish. It doesn't pump out the air volume like some other fan coolers, but the metal stand acts as a heat sink and keeps the laptop noticeably cooler with or without turning on the very quiet fans. It's not quite as wide as my 17"" MacBook, but still feels very sturdy. And I like the fact that the USB cord is not permanently attached, allowing you to remove it for travel or if you don't need the fans.The only reason I didn't give the NotePal five stars is that the front -- which is fairly ergonomic -- covers my DVD drive slot and my screen clasp, so I have to lift my laptop to access these items. This criticism may only pertain to MacBook Pro users. Nevertheless, I like this cooler enough to buy a second one for my other office location."
2,"Useless as a cooling device, but good as a laptop stand","I used this with my 15"" G4 Aluminum Powerbook. I ran Temperature Monitor to display readings from all built-in sensors. When idle, the CPU bottom temperature was about 100. It would reach 140 when running a long Photoshop batch, at which point the built-in fan would kick in. I saw absolutely no change in temperature when I used the NotePal. Which is not surprising given the absolute lack of airflow space between the bottom of the laptop and the top of the fans, and fans which produce next to no airflow to begin with. I am tempted to replace the fans with real ones and power them with their own AC adapter instead of USB.That said, the NotePal did tilt the keyboard and display to a more comfortable angle when editing photos with a tablet in front of the PB. Though it is a horrible angle for extended typing. And it is solidly constructed."
4,The left side of laptop remains hot,I ordered it for my daughter's Mac Book and somehow only cooling the right side of laptop. The left side remains warm/hot. Both fans are working. I called the tech support. They think because the CPU is on the left side so it's hard to cool off so they sent me a spare fan for backup.
4,"good product, no hassles so far","A great product. Bought it around 2 months back, works great so far. Does not super cool the system but i am not expecting that any way from an external cooler at this rate. Has a good slant base which makes typing easier. Extra USB is a a very thoughtful gesture. A good product overall. Surely recommend for the price they quote"
2,Many flaws,"There are quite a few problems with this unit:1. it is extremely heavy and bulky, so forget about any portalbe or travel use.2. As noted by other reviewers, the fans are very poorly placed, much to far back on the computer underside. The cooling is needed where your hands are!3. There are models with 2 and 3 fans, and in silver as well as black.. I mention this because I did not find out until after I received mine and looked at the pictures on the box.4. On a mac, the CD drive is completely covered up... could be quite inconvenient if you use it frquently...Again, not mentioned by the manufacturer as a caveat.5. It is NOT noiseless. The fan may be so, but the fan motors are actually fairly irritating in their whine, in a quiet room. Others I have used have whisper quiet motors.6. The aluminum against aluminum can definitely mark or even scratch or scuff your laptop..has to be used carefully.Not really recommended."
3,It's OK,Nice design and material. I really like the look. It definately helps in keeping the laptop cool.
5,Perfect Tilt,"When I was searching for just that, a nice tilt for my laptop, I came across a lot of contraptions. This does the job neatly and adds an extra bonus of keeping your laptop cool and giving you 1 xtra USB port (it has two,, but takes up one to cool you down). I read that it was too small for some 15"", it is fine for my HP 15""...fits perfectly."
2,Not cool enough,"I have a Dell and it would always over heat. I thought this would help, but it doesn't. I wish there was an option to increase the fan speed then it might work."
3,More good looking than effective cooling,"It does help a bit to moderately cool down your laptop, that is if your laptop have air intake in its underpinnings, otherwise, the shiny aluminium pad just looks darn cool. It should have at least 3 fans."
1,Defective upon arrival,"One of the fans simply would not turn on. Defective, so it only gets 1 star. Maybe most are fine, but I'm rating my unit only. Back it goes!9/9/2007 8:38 am- Update: Antonline, the seller of this product, has so far only replied to my refund request with an auto-generated ""send it back to the manufacturer for warranty service"" email. This is unacceptable. I've sent another email demanding a refund, but I'm getting a bad feeling about Antonline. I'll update this post again in a couple of days either with a positive outcome or a ""buyers beware"" warning."
4,Very nice cooler,"This is the nicest cooler I have seen. Solid aluminum construction doesn't lend itself to ultimate portability, but the working angle is right and it certainly cools well. My only complaint might be that a couple more usb ports would be handy. As has been mentioned, it only has two and one of those is needed to power the unit. So in effect you don't add any usb ports to your system."
3,"Product is good, but","This product works great, but after using it for about 5 days a few of the fan blades broke off. Quality could be better, but it does the job."
4,Great read!,"It's a quick read and too the point. I kind of expected more ideas on how to help tough situations, but it is a short book."
3,A must-read on Malaria,"This is a UN publication resulting from the Millennium Development Goals laid down in 2000. It reads like the report that it is, but the facts are so staggering that one cannot possibly be bored, although some skimming may be required. For those of limited time, there is an executive summary right at the front. What will you learn? That 50% of the world's population is exposed to malaria; that the disease results in 1.1-2.7 million deaths each year; and that 20% of childhood deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are attributable to malaria, just to name a few of the informational tidbits found in these pages. This report outlines concrete solutions to preventing and controlling the disease, and the steps required to achieve them. It also covers obstacles to success, namely financial, but including multimedicine resistance and intellectual property rights issues. This book is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand malaria and other diseases, and the gloabl response to them."
5,Straight Gansta Country Ballin,"Yo Yo, Mustafa in the hizouse straight out Kentucky (Big K repprasent!) Yo so check it, this video is da bomb diggety and a bag of chips. I copped this here video so I can brush up on my line dancin on Fridays, you know, straight showin off some new tricks so all the fly ladies would notice me. Allz I can say is Diana Horner knows how to kick it one time! It's like somethin grabs a hold of me tightly, flow like a harpoon daily and nightly, will it ever stop? yo i don't know, turn off the lights and i'll glow. Yeaaa Boy, straight Vandal. Anyways pick up this vid fo sho, i gave it 5 stars cuz i be gettin it and reppin it na'm sayin? Crazy, big shouts to U.G.O, Filly B, Red Hot, Romie Rom and da rest of da BBS yer yer."
1,Good God! A thousand times no!!,"I went looking for this after I saw a clip of it on the TV show ""Web Junk 20"". I can't believe that something this corny would actually get a good review! And 5 stars at that! Before you waste your money, check out the clip of this video on the ""ifilm"" website. BTW, you *will* see mullets. (Oh *helllss* no!) Then go spend your money on a real hip hop video. Or, better yet, go to the club and see how it's really done."
5,"A obscure classic,,,","I first saw this film while I was stationed in Iceland, It was broadcast from Denmark or Norway, A very Late night movie. I remember trying to watch it through static and snow, and never saw it again.. The film is a accurate look at Vaudille for 1925. One of the Minsky family was a production consultant. Brit Ekland is beutiful as always (no plastic surgery on her) Jason Robards was also very convincing as well. One high point is the appearance of Burt Lahr (The cowardly lion) in what I think is his final film. All of the skits that were performed came from actual shows from the 1920's."
4,A GREAT old movie,"Minsky's is a great comedy about the days of vaudeville vs. Burlesque and a naive young girls venture into show business. Just a delightful story, a lot of laughs and generally entertaining.Better than most TV....try it!"
4,Good fun,"I've very fond memories of this film and delighted now to own a copy. The film I believe, had some production problems at the time, but the end result is hugely enjoyable and Norman Wisdom is a treat in a role that he is perfect for.The Embroidered Corpse"
4,The Night They Raided Minsky,It brings back the old vaudeville shows when I was young. Thanks for the memories
1,Could not play on my DVD player.,"could not play on my DVD player,it said Region2 I never heard that before and didnt know what it ment,I'm sure most people woudn't know what it means.I was told to send it back which I did.I sent it a envelope made for DVD's to be mailed in,I had there address and my return address but they caim they did'nt receive it and it was not returned to me.NOT A HAPPY BUYER>"
4,Very useful,"Just got a used copy of this book today. I've been checking out quite a few books on camcorder production and home video ideas and I think this one is the best so far. The book is filled with photographs that illustrate the techniques and strategies she describes in her book. If she could ever reprint this work, it would be great to have a CD Rom of examples to go along with the text. The only other home video production resource I have found that is equally useful is a video titled, ""Home Video Hits,"" which can also be gotten through Amazon. It's a little dorky in it presentation, but it provides the basic ideas of great video production."
1,Is she a Crab or a Dragon?,"Ree Soesbee has a very unique ability, and that is to take any interesting clan and make it dull, 2 dimensional and very boring. Apart from a couple of glimmers in The Crane she managed to ruin them. Now she has sunk her claws into the Dragon. The Dragon a clan of mystery, riddles and enigma in all regards. Until now, there is absolutly none of that in this book. It lacks completly in every department that the Dragon are known for.The characters are completly flat and she failed to make even the interesting of them worth reading. Whatever this book is about it certainly isn't the Dragon. If you have the rest of the series then you have to get this one to know what is going on. But every single page is a struggle. I hope this is the last novel that Ree Soesbee does."
5,If Only They Could Talk:The Miracles of Spring Farm,"Animal lovers everywhere will enjoy this poignant story of two woman and how they discover (quite by accident) the amazing world of animal communication through telepathy. The evolution of their rescue ranch, Spring Farm CARES is detailed, with all the hurdles and miracles along the way. A must read for all who KNOW our animals speak to us and understand what we say to them, as well as a great persuader for those who might be skeptical. Spiritually touching in ways you can't imagine."
4,"Sweet story of an animal farm with many ""personalities"" jabbering","Truth is indeed stranger than fiction, and I do believe Bonnie and Dawn hear the idiosyncratic ramblings from their host of animals .Interspecies communication is an interest of mine but I much prefer the intelligences of flowers, trees and rocks and their overlords the devas.I state that up front because I would have probably given five stars if I was a true animal loverIf you have any interest in animals and their care- and their viewpoints- you will love this memoir!"
5,Great Book,"Couldn't put this book down. It's a great story about real people in Upstate New York, and how their animal rescue operation came to be. I've been to Spring Farm for a workshop, and I can tell you that it is truly a special place. Thanks to Bonnie and Dawn for sharing. If you're interested in animals, you'll love this book."
2,Do not waste your time with this book!,"I am giving my opinion for the first time on a book, which in this case, is a complete waste of time. I admire animal lovers and care providers, and it seems they do a great job on that farm caring for abandoned horses and other animals. But the book, seems a very bad copy of James Herriot books, even the title is copied from his first book. Even If you believe in telepathic communication with animals (dead or alive), animal reincarnation, UFOs, Human & animal ghosts, Horses writing poems through telepathy, I am pretty sure that you will find this book boring & badly written. Maybe it is their way to make publicity for their farm which depends partly on donations... As I said their Farm for animal care seems admirable, but the book... not worth your time."
3,iPod video clear hard case,"This is a good case but it has a few flaws. The main one is that you have to take it off to remove the connector cable. It is somewhat bulky and the belt clip was way too bulky, loose and awkward. Also if you wanted a case that was unnoticeable this one would be wrong for you. The good things are that it does protect the iPod from scratches. Also it is a pretty simple case. If you were looking for a case that does its job, then this would be a case for you, but if you were looking for a fancy case this one isn't the one for you."
2,Not much there,"OK, it was cheap and it was kinda fun but this book is very short and very light and fluffy. Don't pay much for it because you can read it in a half a day."
2,Not about the movie,A disappointing account with very little about the actual making of the movie or the cast. Mostly about Miss Hepburn's idiosyncracies.
4,Katharine Hepburn!,It is always fun to read about someone so well known. This book gave an amusing & Interesting picture of Ms. Hepburn and the Cast & Crew of the Movie African Queen. A fun read that is now on my coffee table.
4,"I don't like Slave Narratives, but....",this one was pretty good. I always support fellow Quaker's in their writing endeavors hence the purchase. Lorene gives this character depth and a sense of humor if you can believe that...This is a quick read but worth it.
1,"Confusing, boring.",I found this book impossible to get into. I was told it gets clearer and more interesting so I skipped to page 100 and still found it the same. There seems to be no story that moves the reader in a straight line. Very confusing and boring.
5,An excellent source of career advice for anyone,This is an excellent book loaded with great advice for any Junior Military Officer considering a career change to the business world. Roger Cameron just came out with the 3rd edition of this book which includes great new information to help military officers prepare to be competitive in corporate America. It is a very easy read and the author writes in a direct/ no-nonsense style. A very eye-opening book that will be a super tool.
5,An exceptional tool,"I read PCS to Corporate America over 13 years ago. I read it before my interview to earn a position with Cameron-Brooks as a Recruiting Team Leader. I found Roger's advice to be direct and honest. I successfully started my career with Cameron-Brooks in 1997. I have shared the advice in PCS with well over 200 Junior Military Officers I have personally helped transition from the military to business. Some of these former military officers are now Presidents and Vice Presidents in their company. Even though the book provides information geared towards the Junior Military Officer, I have given to my non-military friends and family to help them succeed in interviewing as well. The book and Roger Cameron's direct and honest style may not be right for everyone. When I first read it, I found it refreshing and so do most other officers I speak to. If you are serious about a new career, you owe it to yourself to read it."
2,Take it with a grain of salt....,"This book really targets those who are actually interested in jumping through the Cameron-Brooks' hoop. The title should actually be ""How to Fill Out Your Application Correctly-- And Prepare For the Cameron-Brooks Interview"". The author sprinkles bits of wisdom throughout but you'll have to wade through a thick swamp of fluff to find them. He provides numerous examples of how he's had to turn down highly qualified candidates, mainly through semantic and situational trickery. His information comes from only a select few corporate recruiters (which remain nameless), hardly the convincing data needed to make a strong case. Overall, this is a subjective observation through the eyes of ONE person. So, don't fret over his information and definitely go out and research more options."
4,Delicious!,I was very pleased with these energy balls. Not too sweet and very filling. I am looking forward to purchasing different products from Betty Lou's.
2,Artificial tasting,"Thought I'd give these a try because I was looking for an afternoon slightly sweet snack bar that's high in protein, low-fat and great tasting. Well these are high in protein(which I like), are low in fat(which I like), but I think in their processing to make it low-fat they compromised on the flavor. I was expecting a more natural peanut butter taste but was disappointed with the texture and taste. Artificial!! I will not buy these again. I'm stuck now with the whole box. My hunt continues for that great snack bar."
5,Fabulous product,"These peanut butter balls are great, full of protein and very satisfying. There is only one caveat. Keep them off of the counter if you have a tall dog. My basset got the box down while I was out and enjoyed about 12-14 of these balls. He was very satisfied, however he had a severe case of diarrhea for 3 days. He, however, was very happy. LOL"
5,Filling and tasty!,"Yum! These peanut butter treats are so filling! One kept me satisfied for five hours. Perfect to keep in my desk at work, my car, my purse...anywhere I might be when I'm hungry but don't want to end up eating something unhealthy. As for the taste...you need to be a fan of peanut butter to like these, which I definitely am. There is a slightly odd aftertaste to them, but it's minor and minimal and I don't mind it. The texture is a much denser, peanuty, heavy rice krispy treat in my opinion. I've tried the almond flavor, too, and they are great, but peanut butter is my favorite flavor in anything. The fact that these are high in protein, filling and gluten free is fabulous. I'll buy these again for sure!"
4,Tasty? Maybe not. Useful? Incredibly!,"No, these aren't Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. They have a distinct ""health-food"" taste. But they certainly are filling and they have a lot of energy. I ate two before the LSAT, a 5 hour ordeal, and they kept me going. Also great if you sleep late and need to run to class...just grab and go."
3,Something that needs to be disclosed.,"I have a sever alergy to Gluton. This product States that it is Gluton Free. But in the fine print about posabile alergic warning It States that this product is made in a factory tha might make products with wheat and other alergins. This is a problem with me My alergy is so bad the least bit of contamination by wheat could cause me to have a relaps. Now so saying the chance of contamination may be slight. I can't risk it and and anyone with a Gluton alergy should be made aware of the chance no matter how slight. Other than that the product is good. I ate a few before I read the fine print and was made aware of the posability. I was not harmed, but I was not willing to risk any fruther chance of exposure."
5,Lifesaver!,"For people with who need to eat something between meals to keep their blood sugar levels up, these Peanut Butter Balls are a godsend. Many's the time I've felt the familiar lightheadness and oncoming headache from low blood sugar and been saved by these things. I always carry one in my pocket or purse, and keep one in the glove compartment."
3,My kids couldn't chew them,"These are too dense for my kids to bite (yes they under 5), but I really wanted this for a snack-on-the-go. Now I have to cut them into pieces and then they can chew them. They have a mild ""protein-bar"" aftertaste. I like them o.k. That's about all I would rate them... just o.k. Betty Lou's Crispy Bites are better."
1,Peanut Butter Balls Fall Flat...,"The ""balls"" were squeezed into the box and flattened. The taste is not very ""peanutty"". I'm disappointed."
1,Icky,"These peanut butter balls barely taste like peanut butter. They came up in a glute-free"" search, which is why I bought them, but they aren't gluten-free. They lack in flavor greatly and, for the price, I thought they would be a really awesome treat - nope!"
3,Get what you pay for,"Shipping was timely. The instructions were horrible. The gold ""bolts"" what hold the mirror were plastic. I was a little dissapointed how the glass shelves are merely supported by skinny screws and suction cups. It's a decent set for my 14 year old, who is very petite but I would never buy this for myself."
3,Missing Parts,This item was for my daughter from Santa. We put it together last Thursday and it was missing a part for the mirror. The only way to get the missing part is to fill out the form that came with it and mail it in and wait 4 to 6 weeks. It is frustrating when it is a gift like this and you can't put it all together and no number to call to expedite the part missing. Who's to say that I will even get the part?? I guess that is the risk of buying online.;
4,Another excellent book to read aloud to your children.,"My son and I greatly enjoyed ""The Secret of Spring Mill"". Once again, the reader (and listener) is transported to new and wondrous faraway lands, peopled by exotic, mysterious, and exciting new characters. As a father who reads aloud to his son, and as an author of a (as-yet-to-be-published) series of children/young adults-oriented books, I once again highly recommend Mr. Arnold's works."
5,Kids and adults enjoy this,"This is a delightful book for young children, and adults enjoy it too,for its quiet humor, funny illustrations and gentle message. A greatread-aloud book - children try to anticipate what is going to happen, andget a kick out of the increasing number of visitors as well as theresolution."
2,"Ok, if you live nowhere.","I'm sure this item works fine. IF and only if you live in an unpopulated area. Unfortunately for my hopes of using this, I live in New York City. While there are completely empty stations on the FM dials, unless you're leaning the PodFreq against the antenna, 'bleed over' from other stations interferes in its use.If you're planning on using this in your car, as I was, save the money and invest in a direct line-in to your car stereo."
4,worth the money,"These earrings are perfect for summer - multicolor goes with anything - lightweight, easy to wear"
3,Fascinating but only for the true fanatic,"As many reviewers have said, the very monotony of Aleksandra's last diary gives it an eerie significance. However, beyond that, there is little to recommend it. Entries, spaced one to a page, mostly consist of a single brief paragraph, and the content is boring-- notes on the weather, her health, the health of her children. ""Sat for 10. m[inutes] on the balkony [sic]."" It is a very short book, and a very quick read. Only for the true Romanov fanatic (of which I am one), I'm afraid. Aleksandra's letters and the letters & diaries of the others who shared her captivity are far more interesting."
3,What I think,"This book is about Empress Alexandra finally days in Tobolsk and Ekaterinburg. She notes what she and her family did everyday as an agenda entry. Very few paragraphs, note time, dates, temperature, tea, dinner and few changes with the house,staff and grauds. I recommend this book for followers of the Romanov history as a collections."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,Secrets of the Widow son was really really bad. I wouldn't read this again for a million bucks. [...]
1,Smells like garbage and reads like it too,"I can't believe I picked this book up. It seemed like a good thing to do, but after I got to page 30, I realized it was trash. It almost seems like the author knows nothing about the da vinci code. Everything he was saying was way off. I am not impressed at all."
1,Skip It,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Shugarts claims to do excellent research, but according to my own inquiries, he knows very little about Freemasonry. The book is about as exciting as the classified section of a newspaper."
1,Never came,"I order this item , but never receive it.Tried to call the company or email them, but never got any response. Amazon was very good at crediting my account."
3,Steeler's fleece throw,"The only complaint I have with this product is, it is very thin, & not all that warm. That being said, it was a Christmas gift for my son, & he loved it!"
1,"Oh, well...","I am a firm believer that certain things work for some and not others. This did not work for me, unfortunately. My little poop-eater was munching on doodie the whole time."
1,For-Bid For-Not,we used the product as recommended with no results. For me it was a waste of money and effort.
2,Just doesn't work on all dogs,"I'd read numerous successful reviews/reports of this stopping the dog from eating feces, but it just doesn't work on every dog. My dog was just so food aggressive and hungry that nothing stopped him. It should make that clear on the product info."
2,For Bid,Used to help some but now does not work at all.Even though this is vet recomended it does not work for my dog at all.
2,"Ok, but you can do better.","Martan Mann can most definately play piano. The accompanying CD may almost be worth the price to hear him play. However, you're looking for instruction if you're reading this. I don't want to slam his product too hard. I'll just say he doesn't teach well and there's not allot of real meat here for beginners. I've also purchased Andrew D. Gordon's 100 Ultimate Blues Riffs. Riffs in all keys with many many different basslines and virtually zero instruction. Then, finally, I got my hands on something I absolutely love and can recommend wholeheartedly to anyone without a vast musical background who wants to play the blues. Check out the book/cd combos level 1 and 2 by David Bennet Cohen. You won't be dissappointed. I just ordered ""Improvising Blues Piano"" by Tim Richards and am very excited about it as well. One more you might look into."
3,Great Music Shame About the Sound Quality,"Some excellent work by one of my long time favourite guitarists. I have given this CD only 3 stars as it has been severely let down by poor production/sound quality. I would have rated this 4 stars however the dull, lifeless sound does not do this great work justice. I cannot believe that PT allowed this CD to be released in its current state. Given that it was produced in 2005 I would have expected must better sound production job. I have vinyl from the 70s which sounds much much better.....Here's hoping that things will get better in the future...."
4,A good Tosca with an outstanding Scarpia,This is a very good Tosca. Dessi is a little shrill but otherwise good and a good actor. Her real life husband Armiliato is very good. Where has this man been hiding? Good actor as well. But the show belongs to Raimondi who exudes evil and menace as Scarpia. Benini gives us a fairly slow performance which allows us to luxuriate in Puccini's melodies. The ochestral sound is quite thrilling in DTS. The production is on the lame side. They have made Scarpia a church figure although what kind is hard to say. Certainly a cardinal or bishop would not wear pants but a surplice. The settings are quite dark. You never do get a good glimpse of Scarpia's palace. But at least nothing interferes with this wonderful performance. Probably that best Tosca one could hope for today.
4,Good drive,"My first WD My Book drive delivered from Amazon.com actually never worked but shut down after a few seconds on several computers. After spending nearly 30mins waiting for an only remotely helpful WD helpline rep, I was eventually directed to WD's support website which had a new drive shipped to me in less than 48hrs soothing my initial anger.The new drive works just fine. The software is very easy to use (no installation), but provides only limited functionality. If you consider using this drive for more complex backups (rather than just storing data outside of your PC's hard drive), you should definitely consider upgrading the software."
3,My Book - Western Digital 250 GB external hard drive,I purchased 2 at the same time. One was DOA and after the return process I attempted to daisy chain the 2 units per sell sheet. Can't do it and tech support was no help. I have had them 2 months and one unit runs fine. The other has become noisy and I'm certain will have to be replaced soon. Poor QC on these products.
3,Not really plug and play,"This has a nice design although it is somewhat noisy sitting on my disk, a hmmmmmm. It is plug and play in the sense that you can just plug its usb cable into your computer and it will be recognized but in order to use all the ""features"" you have to load the WD button manager. Just another driver that sits in your system tray and all it does is enable the weird blue light on front to show how much space is used( I still have not figured out how to read it"" and it allows you to power it down as long as no other programs are using it. Which means you have to close almost every program! There is no on/off switch!In Pcmag reviews, performance is lower than other external drives. I just got a 500gig sata drive and coolmax sata enclosure that has firewire, usb and sata ports for $160. The performance is better, it has a on/off switch and it is much quiter."
2,Cannot Recommend,"Pros-its been 2 weeks since Ive had it and it hasnt erased my dataCons-Must turn off computer to turn off harddrive-Sometimes isnt recognized by the computer-Inner ring is supposed to show how much space is left on the drive....it doesnt do that.-SUPPORT IS A JOKE. HAD TO CALL 6 TIMES IN 4 DAYS JUST TO BE PUT ON HOLD. I WAS ON HOLD FOR 20 MINUTES AND THE GUY WAS ANYTHING BUT HELPFUL.Bottom Line-I guess its not that bad, but I would recommend purchasing from another company, my luck with them has been anything but good. But the price is pretty reasonable, but just be careful if you decide to buy from WD."
1,Horrible hard drive - avoid,"I should have read more reviews before buying this ($&$@(@ hard drive. It seems simple enough, take it out of the box, plug it in to power, and then use either the firewire or usb2.0 plugs to connect it to the computer. However, it simply would not work with my windows xp sp2 machine. Every time it would show up for about a second or two and then poof - gone. I looked and looked for a way to make it work - but all I found was bad reviews of other ones that worked for a few days and then died. If you are considering this hard drive, or perhaps any western digital - consider something else."
1,Bad Firewire Ports,"I owned one of these without issue for about 4 months and decided to buy another (same size, same model) to double my external capacity.The new drive's firewire ports (both of them) didn't work. When I exchanged it for a new one, same thing - both firewire ports defective. You can't chalk this up to user error because I own an identical drive and troubleshooted everything on both drives (cross-testing them on different computers, tested the cables, power supplies, etc. etc.) and no dice - it's the ports.One faulty drive I'd chalk up to bad luck, but twice in a row is no coincidence. I'm getting rid of these drives (BOTH of them) because I don't want to trust my precious data to hardware that's habitually bad. I suggest looking at a different company. This isn't the first time I've had issues with a Western Digitial drive."
2,Does not recognize Firewire ports,"My book's firewire port was recognized by a cardbus adapter (I-O gear), but a firewire express card (Startech-2 port ) did not recognize the drive. Any suggestions?"
1,Stay away from this drive!,"I had this drive for a year and used it maybe 4-5 times to store large backup files. One day I couldn't access half of my folders on the drive, with error ""can't access folder"". I did a google on it and found that I was not alone. Lot's of people having same problems. Called western digital tech support and they confirmed that Mybook is having this problem! They also suggested to remove drive from enclosure and use it as stand alone. I did that but the problem was still there. I reformat the drive and it works for now, but lost all the data. So here is the lesson for the rest of you do not rely on the backups 100%, especially by western digital."
3,"Decent product, mediocre software and terrible customer service","This drive is OK. It does what it is supposed to do, i.e. backup, either complete backups or incremental. It would be nice if it had a one-button backup like some other drives, but it doesn't. It is somewhat noisy, so I have only been turning it on to make my backups. The software is not very polished. I would highly recommend purchasing another software backup package. Also, customer sevice is terrible. Since I have a MAC, I had to erase the drive, download their MAC software and install it. The instructions in the manual were totally inadequate. Since I had some questions about the installation, I e-mailed tech support who claimed they would respond within one business day. I got a reply almost 2 weeks later, and my questions were not completely answered. Fortunately, in the meantime I had figured out the proper installation procedures on my own. Hardware is OK, company is questionable."
1,not up to the job,this product does not do the job on tile floors .....I think the brush is not stiff enough to do grout.......Pullman Holt B200752 Gloss Boss Mini Floor Scrubber.
5,get one,"v-good buy one, works great, dont forget to get the cleanerworks on all type of floors, very easy to use."
3,Gloss Boss Mini floor scrubber/buffer,Too Light to do a good job...alright for light clean-up and very noisy for a small buffer...better sound deadening case would help make it quieter and heavier.
2,Gloss Boss Buffer,"On the same day I put together device & used it it broke. I had to add a paper clip to fix but now when I use it, the machines moves all over the place if I don't control it for what ever particular area I'm cleaning."
1,light weight,I did not get what I was looking for. Dissapointed in this. It does not buff the floor like the old fashioned buffers did.
3,"Good, but...","This is a small machine which I like, and it works well. My problem is that I got it to scrub the grout in my tile floor and it doesn't really do that. I tried the micro pads, and the scrubber brushes, and still had to use a little narrow scrubber brush by hand to get the grout lines. Oh well, the floors are really clean now, just was hoping for more. I wonder if they make softer scrubber brushes that will actually go into the grout line?"
5,Gloss Boss Buffer,"I received my order in a timely manner and am very pleased with the product so far. I have only used it a couple of times, but it does exactly what you advertize. Home floor buffers are hard to find, and this is a good one."
2,too light weight.,"I bought this product to polish off the haze that water would leave on my black ceramic tile. It doesn't manage that with any of its discs/brushes. The machine is just too light weight. When I balance a 10lb. bag of cat litter on the top, it starts doing a better job. In general I would not recommend the product, and definitely not for almost a hundred dollars. It beats buffing the floor by hand twice a week, but not by much."
1,Save your money,"Wow, is this a dud. Costing nearly $100 and the construction is so shoddy a 4th grade shop class could have put it together. I don't know how it performs because I never got mine to turn on. It's real junk. The handle is just way too light. I'd suggest if you want to get this that you reinforce the handle with duck tape."
2,Too light to buff laminate floor,"I have laminate floors that look hazy even when clean. I was looking for a buffer which would give them a shine. This buffer is not it. It is too light-weight to make good contact with the floor. The brushes alone do not even touch the floor and with the scrubbing pad or buffer pad, it just barely glides over the floor with no pressure to clean or polish it."
2,I should have listened to other reviews,"I have a big heavy Oreck floor scrubber that works great, but it is heavy. I wanted a light weight scrubber that would be easier to handle. This Pullman Hold Mini Floor Scrubber is light--too light. I wanted to scrub out the floor of my shower pan--the Oreck cleaned it in minutes--the Pullman is so light that it didn't even scrub out one speck of the soap film on the floor.It doesn't have enough weight or power to be very effective. I tried to clean the tile floor in my bathroom and it did nothing to clean the grout or surface texture of my tiles.It's a waste of money."
1,save your money,"Ladies Save your money..This product is useless,used it twice never againgave it away Glad to be rid of it."
4,me gusto,llego a tiempo y me gusto tanto que compre otro para regalar. la maquina es todo un exito limpia muy bien el piso de todas las impuresas y lo deja inmaculado.
1,Learned a sorry lesson,One of the worst machines I ever owned. Trying to get rid of it is difficult. Hardly ever use itBig waste of money.
1,Worthless product - unresponsive seller,"I should have listened to other reviewers that this was a shoddy product. It broke after only a couple hours (cumulative) of very light use.It is also constructed so that you cannot even attempt to do your own repairs or troubleshooting to see what the problem might be. There is not a manual. It came with nothing more than one page that told how to connect the handle, etc. That was it.That leaves me stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm out over $100, I don't have a floor buffer and the seller will not return my email asking to discuss replacement or reimbursement."
2,light weight,"I will give this machine another try, but I possibly need a more weighty polisher for the task of polishing wood floors that aren't in the best of condition. This machine confuses me -- what would you use it for?"
1,Dont' buy,So disappointed. Unit so lite--has no weight nor power to scrub a tile floor--my hand with with a scrub brush does better!!definitely NOT worth buying.
4,Gloss boss scrubber/buffer,Decent price for product. Does a good job on floors and carpets that are taken care of on a regular basis. I had to scrub by hand the worst part of the floors.
5,Even better than before,"This collection offers Chomsky's usual knowledge and analysis of a wide variety of social and political topics. A large amount of the material was written in the 1980s, although this new expanded edition brings the book's scope all the way up through 2003. Readers approaching Chomsky for the first time may want to start with his book Understanding Power, but for those familiar with the subject matter this is a valuable and very welcome collection."
1,Manufactured religion,"I found this book to be a strange blending of all major religions into Bahai, while it deftly eliminates all the points of these religions that clash with each other. It shows that Bahai has a mission, to unite all nations into one world, and it seems that the Bahai faith is the 'tool' for that union.It is well written, has the poetic language of many Middle-Eastern religious writings, does not attack anyone, and it will be able to attract people who are not really familiar with the doctrines of their own faith. It is -in my opinion-the ultimate in manufactured religion."
1,There are better and cheaper options,"I am a graduate student in structural engineering. My field of specialization is steel design. By mistake, I bought this book that unfortunately happened to be very bad. The author has a serious lack of knowledge about the topic, and the information discussed in the book is too basic. If you are looking for a good book for steel design, go for William Segui's book. If you have a good understanding of the subject and want something more advanced, go for Salmon and Johnson's book."
5,A treat for all communicators,"Mr. Tofel provides an enjoyable and sympathetic account of how President-elect Kennedy managed the production of this rhetorical bombshell.Like most presidential speeches, Kennedy's inaugural was a group effort, drawing upon the words and ideas of many gifted people. Tofel does an excellent job of pulling the speech apart, and showing the influence on particular passages of Kennedy's contributors and advisors, and of historical works such as Shakespeare and the Bible.Lawyers and other communicators will be inspired by Kennedy's ability to fuse all these sources into one of the most invigorating of all Presidential inaugurals."
5,Our son loves his spunky,We are buying our 2nd one to have in the car and an extra to wash. Our son loves to snuggle up with the dog. He sleeps with it every night. We have washed it numerous times and it comes out looking great. Definitely worth it!
4,Well made nephews love it.,Made well. My nephews love it .Wish they were bigger though since I want one lolMake sure you buy two cause if one get dirty and worn out the kids know when you replace it with a new one
2,"Disappointing, not enough depth, disjointed","I think something gets lost in this book which is trying to make a tie to TV show. It is basically rather shallow, not just an easy book for early readers. My son, an avid consumer of all nature books, does not want to read this book and he will read most nature books with me, or alone, multiple times. Perhaps the book makes more sense if you have seen the TV show or can use it as a companion to the TV show."
2,DOA/Doesnt seat right,"Just purchased these and so far 4 of the cartridges have been empty, Also several of the ones that werent empty did not seat well in the gun. Previously I purchased the Crosman cartridges with no problems at all, looks like ill be going back to them."
4,The box opened in shipping...,"I opened it and realized that all of the co2 carts got out of the ""daisy"" box, just rattling against eachother. poor packaging, but i checked them. Not one had went off in the box."
3,Daisy CO2,"The gun is a brand new Crosman 357 the carts Daisy. Product arrived like many others have described. Out of the original packaging and rolling around a box you could put about 8 of the product boxes. Packing was two sheets of brown paper. This is most unlike Amazon. Usually the packaging is very professional. This time not so much. Must be the location these are coming from. They arrived seperately from the gun etc. I gave them a 3 not because of Amazon's packing but because they do what I assume they are supposed to so that's average/good. I got 60 shots out of the first and only cartridge. Some of the pellets stayed in the empty milk carton I was using as a target, so not overwhelming power! Also 4 of the 6 magazines had a pellet left after taking the 10 shots. I took my time between shots. We'll see how it goes with the rest."
5,Excellent vocal technique book.,"This is an excellent and thorough book on vocal technique. Very well-written. Very erudite and informative. And, it's an interesting read. No gimmickry here, just solid, science-based information."
5,One of Stan Whitmires' best performances!!!!,"I have long been a fan of pianist Stan Whitmire. I own most of his CDs that feature sacred music and a few of the secular ones. I recently found this one and was pleasantly surprised to find that it is one of my favorites. I love to put it on after a stressful day at work. His calm, laid back style helps me relax."
4,"best of many ""best of"" sets","The cream of this great group's material has been repackaged many times. To my mind, this set does the best job of capturing the meat of the classic first three records (the weight, cripple creek) & making a representative selection of the rest (like the seldom heard Knockin Lost John) . The cover tunes, which span rockabilly, blues, and motown, are well chosen and showcase these performers as players players. The set is also nicely sequenced--feels more like an album than a grab-bag. One could quible (where is ""acadian driftwood?"") but on the whole it should sit side by side in your collection with their great concert recording Rock of Ages."
2,Missing Some Important Stuff...,"I really don't see this album as ""definitive."" There is too much missing from it. The Band is an artist that I really don't think there can ever be a ""comprehensive"" compilation of their work. There is simply too much to cover. Right off the top of my head, it's missing Jawbone, Rockin' Chair, Hobo Jungle, Georgia On My Mind and many, many others. The Band is a group that is worth collecting all of their albums, so if you buy this and you like it and decide to collect all of their stuff (which you should) then you just wasted $50. Plus, that reminded me, $50 is ridiculous for this! It is about $9 for the remastered, expanded editions of all of each of their 7 albums. 9 times 7 is 63. Just 13 dollars more than this with about 5 times the songs. I just don't think the value is any good. Don't waste your money."
4,Another winner out of the Constitutional Library of America's foremost Economist during his lifetime!,"A beautifully, short, concise bookwritten in plain layman's Englishfor any literate person to see howwe have been robbed and ripped offsince Dec. 23rd, 1913! Should be re-quired reading at all US High Schooland College University campuses!Bravo, Murray!"
4,Central Banks Are Wolves in Sheep's Clothing,"Murray Rothbard warns us about the inevitable result of central banks. He explains about government printing money to pay for its debts and the evil partnership of government and banks from Jekyll Island in 1910.Americans have their head in the sand about problems we've had with central banks in the past. Andrew Jackson and others smashed them all for a reason.The government is a runaway debt train - with the Fed and the banking cartel printing paper to fuel it.I recommend other books by Murray Rothbard and Ron Paul - and two especially good educational books that explain why our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution in the first place. ""First Principles"" by Thomas Tripp and ""5000 Year Leap"" by Skousen."
4,Need to know,"A lucid and pithy explanation of how banking works--and doesn't. Somewhat of a thought experiment, since the Fed isn't going away, it's getting worse! Anyway, it's enough to make you want to borrow someone else's money, until your realize your borrowing your own!"
2,Confusing after midpoint in book,"Book was great until about midpoint then it rambles on and will leave you confused as heck as to whats going on, to many insignificant names and titles are thrown at one time and will have you forgetting whose who and whats what. But the beginning has some great points so its worth a read."
4,The case for the FED,"This book gives a simple case for changing the money under the federal reserve system to gold system of money. After reading the history of the creation of the FED, I see clearer the need for fiat money and a system to control it. We should continue the federal reserve system and teach people how it benefits a society when run properly."
3,Simple argument... too simple,"This is interesting for a person wanting to be initially exposed to current libertarian thought. However, as with many extreme libertatian ideas, the argument is too simple too work. The real world is complex and so are its issues. Solutions, are thusly, not purely libertarian, socialist, or any of these black and white views of ideologies. This pinpoints the need for possible reform, but throws the baby out with the bathwater."
4,What went wrong?,"Since the 30's the policies of the FED have been exposed and still our public servants do not see how wrong these policies are and have led to the present unsolvable economic situations. Neither political party has developed a leader ( Ron Paul being the exception) that could lead us out from this fiasco. Still the public is deceived and mislead by the current election candidates, perhaps on undeliverable promises."
3,"Wrong size, too small","Too small. I ordered another belt, but then found that for now I do not need a belt after all."
5,Just what I was looking for,Systems in English Grammar: An Introduction for Language TeachersThis was the exact book I needed for grad class and cost less than the one in the book store.
4,"Great Wipe, No Orange?",Great heavy duty wipe that I have come to expect from Clorox! Only ordered this because the orange sceted ones were unavailable at the time. The scent of these are a bit overpowering for me and I would much prefer the orange scnet!
1,Very strong and bad smell,"The lavender smell is too strong and the smell causes allergic reaction. It caused me to sneeze and I had to put it away.My pets normally would not mind with the other scents (orange, lemon and the original scent), but for this smell, they will walk away when I opened the lid.Since it is purchased as a pack , once 1 tub is opened, I cannot refund it. I definitely would NOT buy this scent again."
5,"More lavender wipes, please!","I ordered the Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the Lavender fragrance for my sister in another state. She does not drive, and she uses a lot of Clorox wipes. She had never used the Lavender scent before, so I wasn't sure how she would like it. As it turned out, she loved the Lavender wipes more than any other fragrance in the Clorox (or any other brand) wipes. I had ordered a case, so I visited her before she used them all and can confirm how good they smell compared to most wipes. I was very disappointed when I went to Amazon again shortly afterwards to order more, because (as of the date of my review) they have been unavailable since."
1,Closure Seven,"This book reads like it was written by a 7 year old! There were so many mispelled words, misuse of the word ""your"" in place of ""you're"" and many other errors in just the first 3 pages! I am returning the book. It is only 74 pages long and cost $14.95! You've got to be kidding me! The book has clearly not been edited. It's poorly written and has not been thought out before writing it. It's like she sat at the computer and wrote it in an hour. Shame on her publisher! I would not recommend wasting your money on this book."
5,Good Book,"I bought this book in addition to the others from the princeton review course and they were great! If you put the time into preparing, you will find that you dramatically increase your score without having to pay for the course!"
1,Meant to Be Used With a Class,"While this is excellent test prep, it is incomplete as this book is meant to be used in the Princeton Review's class (which is why you won't find it sold new). Instead, I recommend buying Cracking the LSAT, which is meant as a stand-alone prep book."
2,shirt review,"I am and have been a Hulk Hogan fan. I bought the shirt, which was way overpriced ($22). The printed 'hulkamania' was too high on the chest. It should be lower. And it shrunk tremendously in the dryer so I can't wear it. I gave it to a relative."
1,Never got,I still haven't received this item. What is going on with it. I've sent several messages stating I got someone elses item and you told me you were going to take care of it. I've still never received my item.
2,"EDITING, SORELY NEEDED","Mary Mackert weaves an interesting tale of life as a young, polygamist bride. This book is enlightening, from the perspective of a girl who actually chooses to marry an older man and ""poof"".I gave this book two stars because the lack of editing makes the book excruitiatingly painful to read! The grammatical errors and out-and-out typos are distracting and make it difficult to escape into the novel. This book would've been far more entertaining had it been PROOF READ before publishing. Because of the errors, and the large type-face, I felt like the book was over-priced and not worth the read."
5,Could not put this one down!,"Reading this book was incredible, I honestly could not put it down until I was done. It is hard to believe that this lifestyle of child brides, muliple wives and abuse is proclaimed to be ""Godly"" and is accepted by the Morman religion. What a life Ms. Mackert has endured! I can't wait for the next book in her series."
3,Realistic portrayal of escape from Polygamy,"I greatly admired this lady's courage in the face of sometimes terrifying adversity. The book presents a fascinating picture of a polygamist family. Ms. Mackert is a good writer, too. I was shocked, however, by the apparent lack of editing. There are as many as three errors on some pages! If xpolygamist.com intends to keep on publishing these books, and I hope they will, they should hire an editor. I often felt I was reading the draft of the book, not the final version."
2,Difficult to read,"I feel this book is poorly written. It needed to be proof read before printing. It was, for sure, not worth the $20. The facts about the polygamists' every day life, & struggles, are very educational, & sad, but there are so many grammatical errors that I had to reread sections for them to make sense. I found myself correcting grammar, instead of taking in the subject matter. I doubt I will be purchasing any more books from this publisher."
4,"Product is fine, but the stitching isn't great","This product is just fine for what it is, it functions well and does what it advertises but the stitching comes out very easily. The thing was falling apart within a week of owning it. If you pick this one up be prepared to reinforce the stitching so that you can make it last a bit longer."
3,It will do.,"It has some design flaws. Expected more from a harbinger product. The padding sheds, but it serves it's purpose."
5,One of my all time favorites for more than 30 years!,"I first heard this marvelous album at a ""Students for a Democratic Society"" fundraising party, in a cool old house in Venice, California, in late 1968. It has haunted me ever since. I've owned it on record, tape and cd, and have played it more times, I think, than nearly any other single album and I still feel just as moved and just as thrilled. Odetta's magnificent voice and spirit will live forever, even tho' this great lady passed today. Thank you, Odetta, for sharing your heart with us."
3,No Good for the Foundation Version,"I have only tried the free sample version, but I have found that the second lesson and subsequent lessons cannot be completed due to deficiencies in the Foundation version of JBuilder. My version is 4.0.152.0. As the CD-ROM is for beginners, who would most likley be using the Fondation version, it is unfortunate that the authors did not use this version for developing their course. If you are fortunate to be using the Professional version of JBuilder, I think that the course would be very good for those with absolutely no knowledge of JBuilder."
1,Save your money,This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. It's an absolute farse. Trust me on this one: Save your money and buy something else. I plan to write Referentia a letter asking them not to let idiots program thier software.
1,File Handle,The file handle I received looks different from the one pictured. It looks much cheaper. The chuck holder is not attached at 90 degrees to the handle; so that when you insert your needle file it is not parallel to the handle.
4,Simple but effective,"It was surprisingly hard to find a good handle for my needle files. I wanted something that had a screw tension adjustment, not just a hunk of wood with a slot drilled out for the file to slip into (and out of, as soon as its actually used).This handle works great, holds the file securely and is comfortable to hold. What more could you want?"
2,Hampering Hamper,"The assembly was easy, so was the material. Part of the edges crumbled when I was assembling the merchandise. FYI, this is the first time I felt I was assembling a delicate piece of furniture. It shouldn't have been like that. BUT, if you need a hamper for negligees or delicates only, this would be it. Very small.It looks nice though as a corner piece by the bathroom."
1,For Puzzle Lovers only,"If you enjoy the challenge of figuring out tiny little pictures to create a 3D puzzle this is for you. That is, of course, if you don't mind that the product is a flimsy little thing with missing screws and factory applied crooked moldings.If you want a functional clothes hamper keep looking!"
1,I threw mine away!,"The directions were so awful that it took hours to put together, by the time it was assembled, it was ruined! Taking it apart and putting it back together the side cracked. Waste of time and money!"
5,Best darn book yet,This is one of the most comprehensive books on this subject yet for the person that wants to identify all models of this military weapon.
1,Peterson's MCAT Success,"This is by far the worst book I have used to prepare for the MCAT. I have found that many of the answers in the practice tests are wrong, there are many typos, and the verbal reasoning passages sound like they were written by high school students. Also, the biological sciences section of the MCAT is supposed to be 50% biology and 50% organic chemistry, but the biological sciences practice tests in this book contain no organic chemistry questions whatsoever."
1,Not worth it,"This book is too simplistic. The areas that Peterson's is reviewing should be common sense to anyone planning on taking the MCAT. The only reason to purchase this book is to use its practice tests. They are not AAMC tests by any means. However, practice tests are important in quantity even if they lack the quality."
4,Fresh Look,Nice new look for an old rifle. For under 60$ it's worth half the price of the gun. Easy to install and will make for easier clean of the barrel with more of it exposed. Should ease recoil with rubber butt pad instead of original matal plate. Pleased with purchase.
4,nice feel,"The stock is easy to swap out, only took about 10 minutes. If you have a 91/30 your barrel will extend beyond the hand guard about a 14"", but that should be obvious with such a long rifle. The craftsmanship is great, not perfect. I didn't have to mod the stock at all for fitment but there were a couple little bumps I sanded out. Over all a good investment to make the classic gun look new again."
2,Warped Stock - Impossible to Correct,"I read the instructions that indicated that the stock would likely need to have internal material removed to fit the barrel and action. OK, no problem. I went into this expecting that. What I did not expect is that the last 8 inches of the stock toward the forward end are warped in such a way that the stock itself curves to the right. With a symmetrical barrel channel, the left side gradually touches the barrel and then outright presses against it close to the end, whereas the right side has a gap that just gets wider and wider. There is a visible external bend to the stock. Brute force can straighten it out, but there is no way to ""unbend"" the stock. It is barely usable. I do not recommend this unless ATI is willing to make the situation right somehow."
1,its junk,"This stock looks great but doesnt fit my 38 at all. I attempted to grind away some of the interior for a fit, however removing the necessary amount of material for a successful barrel float and round cycle, there was not a good fit between the upper and lower receivers. The stock is not a good fit, and modifying it seems to make it unsafe (my opinion). Im going back to the wooden variety for this rifle."
3,lots of work. shouldn't be for $60,"so this is my second ATI product. The first i was very impressed withATI Marlin Semi-Auto Fiberforce Gun Stock.This oneATI Mosin Nagant 7.62x54R Monte Carlo Gun Stockwas nothing but a head ache even with a dremal tool. Everything fit perfectly now im trying to get the damn gun to cycle. Be prepared for work. I hope im not stuck with a single shot rifle.(can only load one bullet at a time...) Not sure how it shoots yet, stay tuned."
5,mosin-nagant,One two three go. This stock is great took more time to take the old stock off my mosin than it did to install the new one. zip zop all done in about 3 minutes. great product no slopp in the fit.
2,91/30 Mosin Nagant does not fit!,"This stock was very nice, and sturdy! as well as visually appealing.But that only lasted until I had to install the barrel and reciever. The reciever was nowhere near a ""drop in"" fit. Had to use a Dremel tool to enable reciver to fit. Then once that task was finished i had to grind out the bolt indentation in order for bolt to even shut all the way.But once that was accomplished i encountered yet another issue. The barrel would not seat tightly against the stock, which in turn would cause the barrel to 3 out of the 5 initial shot pull itself out of the stock a quarter of an inch.If you dont mind grabbing onto a hot barrel and pushing it back into the stock this is the product for you!I recently put the original Tula manufacture 91/30 stock back on and of course had no problems. Looks like im keeping this rifle original afterall."
2,hope you got a dremel tool,i expected to do a little bit of work with this stock to get it to fit properly but after entirely too long of grinding on this thing i just gave up. spend the extra money to buy a nicer stock that requires MUCH less work
5,Turns an old surplus rifle into a long range modern hunting rifle!,"Awesome! Bought the Mosin Nagant to use for hunting. In its original configuration it was heavy, clumsy and bulky. With this stock all that is no more."
5,"great stock, great price!","Ok, so this stock was what made me go through with the purchase of my mosin nagant. This thing looks sweet when you get it on. If your a wwii buff obviously you wont want this but if your like me and come up on a good deal on a mosin and like modern weapons, this stock is definitely for you. Its super comfortable while shooting too. It beats the heck out of the metal wrapped stock on the original wood stock. Installation is pretty quick and simple too. ATI has a great video on youtube with step by step instructions on how to properly install this. All in all this was a great buy and increased the functionality and looks of my new mosin and I would highly recommend this stock to anyone"
3,Requires Taking off Front Sight to install,"The ATI sight as well as the discription of this product don't mention that in order to get the back barrel band off the gun you have to remove the front sight to get it off (on 91/30s). this is NOT a simple procedure, I bought a soft face hammer and some drifting pens for the task but the front sight wouldn't budge. Had to take the gun to a gun smith to get the front sight off.I find the discription of the required steps to have a proper install highly misleading. I suppose you could argue that removing the barrel band is not ""required"" but it seems like that would create accurasy degrading harmonics and uneccesary damage to gun to leave it on.The reason why it gets 3 stars is because I can't give it 2.5. The product is still clearly a well thought out, well made product, i just wish it were more explict about what is acutally invovled in the ENTIRE installation of the stock."
4,A new look for something old,"I give this stock 4 out of 5 for the same reasons as most everyone else most likely. First the positive, it looks fantastic and completely modernizes a 70 year old rifle. The negative which loses it it's 5 star rating can be quite a bit of sanding to be done to get a correct fit. However I would still purchase it because there is not too much that goes into the modification except for time."
5,Excellent Upgrade For The Price,"I ordered This stock on Monday, May 14 2012 and received it today the 17th. Looks great on my 1939 91/30 Mosin Nagant. I did have to shave down the stock just slightly at the ejection port but it sounds alot scarier than it actually was. It fits like a glove. This awesome stock adds a much more solid feel to the rifle while keeping the weight pretty close to stock, if not just slightly lighter. I would recommend this to anyone looking to ""spruce up"" their old classic Mosins. Fired about 50 rounds though it without a single problem. The bolt runs through the receiver just like stock. A+ ATI. You've done it again!"
2,Hope you have a Dremel!,"Horrible!!! I had to go out and buy a Dremel just to make this fit! After hours of grinding it still not up to par. The overall look is good, but I WILL NOT shoot my weapon with this piece of garbage attached....."
1,ATI Monte Carlo Mosin Nagant Stock - P.O.S.,"Avoid this product at all cost. First off, it's not a drop in stock as they advertise. You have to do some pretty heavy cutting on the stock to clear the extractor spring. Then when you go out to shot the weapon you find that the barrel/action will rise upwards about 3/4 of a inch and there is nothing left to do except tape or clamp the barrel to the stock (looks like crap - look at the pictures on the Internet) or use your $70.00 ATI gun stock to crush cans with. Spend a few more dollars and buy either a Boyd's stock are even better buy a Bluegrass Mustang gun stock.They both have many models available from $98.00 to $200.00 and you get a better stock for your money."
1,Mosin Nagant stock review,I have a 1942 91/30 and the stock was too small for the rifle. It required so much grinding just by looking at it that I sent it back.
2,"M91/30, 1939, Tula, Round Receiver",I bought this for my M91/30.My biggest complaint is that requires so much grinding away of the material to make it fit properly. So much so that I began wondering if it had been intended for another rifle.I had to grind away large portions of material so the Ejector and Ejector spring would function.I also had to file down the inside cavity area where the Trigger guard & magazine fits in. It was squeezing the magazine so hard the rounds could not travel through it. This to required a significant amount of material removal.Filing had to be done in the forward areas of the receiver and portions around the barrel area for it to fit into place.If you buy one of these I would suggest you have the proper tools for grinding and filing.-ejack
4,"great product, but some grinding/filing is necessary",this stock is well amde and should last a long time like any other stock.. definitely makes the mosin nagant look more up to date. Only problem with this stock is it required a good amount of filing/cutting with a dremel tool to get the stock to fit and let the gun work properly..
5,Does drop in BUT...........,Needs to be sanded down or material taken off to ensure a snug fit. most people who say it just dropped and used are not incorrect but will not be a perfect fit without minor modifications. My stock dropped in but still needed few removal of material. ATI does state their product will need this is as well. other than that my rifle looks nothing like the boring stock look. it actually likes like i paid high dollar for it. Fyi buy some balck duracoat as the barrel will reveal ugly abuse underneath the wood from when it was made.
4,Good Stock,"It's a nice product. Not as ""drop in ready"" as I had hoped. Had to do minor alterations to get it working. But I liked the finished product."
5,No better accessory out there!,To upgrade your Mosin Nagant this is all you need. ATI is a great company with a great product at a fair price. These stocks install in minutes and totally change your military rifle into your favorite rifle.
4,"Good item, requires some work","I put this stock on a 1939 Mosin Nagant 91/30. It took quite a bit of filing and sanding to be able to seat the receiver and barrel in the stock correctly, however this is something that I knew going into this project (and is outlined in the product description). Total time spent sanding and filing was approximately 1 to 1.5 hours. Once the filing and sanding is done, it is a very solid stock, and looks much more modern than the original wood stock. I definitely recommend this item to those that are looking to modernize their rifle, or to preserve the wooden stock on the weapon.The reason for 4 stars is that the item does require so much alteration to seat correctly, however with a rifle of this age, it should be expected as this stock is made to fit many different renditions of the Mosin Nagant.The stock is well built, and solid. It has a mount up front for a bipod/sling, as well in the back. It is well machined and the quality overall is very high."
4,Mosin Nagant Synth. Stock,4 out of 5 Stars. I definitely recomend this product. Had to do some minor shaving inside the stock to properly seat the receiver. I'm the only person I've heard of to have to do that.
2,Amazon sent me the completely wrong stock,Amazon was speedy with shipping my stock. once i recieved it was excited to open the box until i did and saw that they sent me the completely wrong stock from what i ordered. its supposed to be for a mosin and i recieved one for an sks with a mosin sticker put on the corner of the box!! lets just hope they get me the correct stock and in an acceptable amount of time!! ill come back to this review if i receive the correct item
2,Drop in? Not even close,"Stock looks good until you set your rifle in it. Calling this drop in is quite an exaggeration. I spent alot of time with a dremel getting this to even go in and even with knowing that i will be glass bedding this and removing extra, time and time again extra wasn't enough for it to even sit in. Not only was it a sloppy fit but sighting down mine i could tell before setting the gun in that the tip did not line up with the rest of the stock. It has a sever bend at the end that makes it look sloppy. Good thing ill be floating the barrel because it looks bad. Tinkerers might enjoy the process but I didn't. (Just for clarification I am a custom cabinet builder and know my way around tools.)"
1,The Stock was Warped,Mine stock came and its warped. There is no possible way I can get my barrel to fit comfortably into this stock.. Imust have got a defected one..Im not happy at all because I dont think I can even return it because I dont have the box.
5,a must have for a M91/30,"I bought this with some type of hesitation reading the reviews about people having to modify it. I guess i was one of the lucky ones who had a perfect fit no problems with it. I don't know it it because i have a 1943 or what but no problems. i like the looks of it and it has a nice ""sissy"" pad on it so you have no problems putting lots of round down range with no pain of a metal butt stock."
5,It Makes My Mosin Nagant Soooo Purrty :),"I love it!!! Yes,i had to do some grinding on the inside to make the barrel/reciever sit in it good but hell,whoever complains about doing that shouldn't have a gun in the first place..cause as us TRUE gun owners/gunsmiths know..guns and gun parts can be a bit finicky.If you're not willing to do the work then take up a different hobby.But anyways,the stock is great and really updates/brings back to life with some flare my old 1943 Mosin Nagant 91/30 with the barrel cut off to 22"" and crowned (by me).This stock is highly recommended!"
4,some fitting required,this is not a drop in stock by any means but if you take your time and sand/file fit the barreled action to the stock it works well. i was pleasently surprised at the quality of the piece much better than i expected .the comb is a bit low and even with mounting the scope as low as possiable it still needs a cheek pad.
1,Bad fitting,Did not fit even after hours of constant grinding and shaping. Just keep the wood stock it looks better anyways.
3,Well it does say it on the box,its a great stock!!! it says right on the front some modification required so be warned!!! Other than that it does come with a washer and instructions to help seat the barrel better.
1,STAY AWAY,Didnt fit! went from box to work bench to GARBAGE! warped and barrel did not fit! dont but ati is a bad company! never buying form them again!!!
3,ehh though my would fit like a glove....no such thing.,"i got the stock after 2 long weeks after placing the order. Out of the box looks very nice i thought it would fit pretty well. Long story short took me like 3 hours of grinding and using sand paper to fit the action in the stock, after i put it in i tried loading the rifle and the bullets wouldnt go in the magazine so i had to take it off again and grind more because the extractor couldnt do its thing so i had to grind more of the side. Overall its a pretty nice stock feels solid its ok but a little bit of work."
5,Improved,"The Monte Carlo stock is nice. I bought 2 and had to modify the heck out of both of them. Otherwise, it is too tight and the round will not feed or eject properly. With a lot of grinding and sanding it fit great. Not a ton of work to do to update the rifle about 60 years. It is lighter. Easier to hold, has some extra buttstock length. sits better. The cheek rest is a joke. not sure why others say its nice. It will do, but only because it comes built into the mold. Don't get me wrong. This is so much better when comparing to the wood or wood laminate stocks. I give it 5 stars because it is a day and night difference. Recoil is better, the checkered pattern is nice for grip, and things are in the right places."
1,bad stock,My stock was missing the but cap. It didn't fit at all and now i'm going to have to spend hours sanding. The plastic stock is a hard resin and the sanding or filing is a long boring job. Where's my end cap?
4,great stock,this stock looks great and was delivered one day early and ups even dragged my trash can on the porch to hide the box.the stock looks great was a very tight fit and did require a little filing for the cartridge interrupter to work properly but was no big deal...would have only taken 30 seconds with a dremel tool.{i used a knife}i would buy another if i end up with another mosin
3,"Good, but needs grinding","Just like people heard, it needs grinding and even a little more grinding to get it free floated, but otherwise its a great polymer stock that feels to be a quality build."
3,It' ok,"Have tried this stock on several mosins -- fits well on most, not so well on a few. The stock is nice and light, although there were a few factory blemishes that needed to be sanded down. Despite the products claim, it is not indestructible -- it actually scratches quite easily. Expect to put in at least an hour modding various parts of the stock to fit your gun. Overall it's a decent, light, & cheap stock -- good for the field, but if you have the money, go with a decent wooden monte carlo stock. Also, shipping took several weeks as there were multiple problems with shipping."
2,Mosin replacement stock doesn't fit well.,"Bought this stock with a gift certificate. Glad I didn't use my own money because it doesn't fit well. When the rifle (a 91/59) is in it, it squeezes the interrupter so you can't load rounds in the magazine.I guess I'll keep it - maybe hollow out the area that presses on the interrupter spring and see if that helps.But I would not buy one of these with my own dough!"
2,Doesn't fit? I can help!!!!!,"This stock is alright but it took me two days of sanding and dremeling to fit it. The instructions were garbage! I went to the ATI website and it was garbage too! The instructional video was bull****! I will be posting a Youtube video soon showing how and where the stock needs to be cut. I just don't want anyone else to go through what I did. My channel is ""Flare for the theatrical"" user name Jwalsto2. Check it out! I will be posting the video soon! Otherwise, the shipping was alright but the box was torn in multiple places. Mine is ridiculously crooked! I am using a heat gun just to warp it into it's proper shape!!! Way too much work!"
1,Fits good but wont allow me to load magizine,"They need to include a file with the piece of junk. The barrel and magazine fit fine but the gun wont load now, it will load in the old stock and comne to find out the plastic is not etched out enough for the bullet to go down into the magazine. So now I need to wait until I can afford a metal file to fix the stupid piece of junk. Youd think they would make it so it could allow clearance."
3,Decent,The stock fit my 91/30 well except around the extractor. I had to dremel out the stock around the extractor to be able to load the mosin's magazine while it was in the stock.
2,Close but no cigar,Stock didn't fit barrel right. Still works but gun feels awkward when shooting. If barrel fit right it would be fantastic. Going to plan B.
4,guy buy for the money,As with all ATI products I needed to do a little fine tuning to make this fit perfect. Butttttttt ATI tells u that in the description... So if you cant do a little work on something or use your head a little to figure out what needs to be done you probably shouldn't be working on (or own for that matter) a firearm. Even though you dont have to figure it out since they give u descriptive pictures telling you what needs to be done... I only give it 4 stars because I do have cheerio sized spot on the bottom of the stock that is light grey and rough from where the stock was snapped off the mold they use. A simple fix would have been to have the plastic injection point be on the same spot they put the sling studs... duh. All in all a good piece and I enjoy a little thinking and putting a little work into something.
4,Took some adjusting,"Great stock. Looks great. Took a fair amount of dremel griding to get it to stick.I would have expected that despite all the various manufacturing locations and generations of the Mosin Nagant, that ATI would have used the guns from the 2 Russian plants in order to model the fit for this rifle. It doesnt feel that they did. Its almost like this stock was based on an ""average assessment of all 91-30s"" and that no matter what Mosin you have, you will surely need to adjust at install. So, good stock. Looks great. But....have your dremel ready and know what you are doing when you use it."
4,Excellent Stock for Mosin Nagant...but not perfect,"I chose this stock for price, value and availability. After making a mess out of my original stock while attempting to drastically modify it, I gave in and bought this stock. Great decision. Excellent length and cheek weld compared to the original. It's not a straight drop-in unit though. The stock is too tight around the action and there are a few sharp edges caused by casting marks. These are easily corrected and I honestly expected this after reading several review. I will smooth up the stock in several places and relieve the areas of the stock that contact the action. This shouldn't take more than 30 min start to finish. Looking forward to my awesome ""new"" scout style Mosin with its 20"" barrel, muzzle break and stock. Can't wait to shoot it!"
5,Some trimming required,"Great stock, good value. You will need to do a little trimming around the bolt assy. because a clip will not feed into recever to load,(if you have clips)and you will not be able to chamber any round unless you stand on it. The ""ejector"" is limited in it's travel out when trying to load a round because it comes in contact with the stock. Almost like trying to open a car door, when the car next to you is only inches away. Very easy to trim the stock with a Dremel or like tool. If you run into this same issue, cut out the material the full length of the ejector, approx 2 inches. Patience and a little time will get the job done. The stock is comfortable, absorbs a lot of the recoil and makes the unit look like a modern rifle. Well worth the investment and time to modify."
3,Good But Warning,"This is an awesome addition to an M91/30 or other Nagant rifles, but be warned that if you do buy this their might be extra work to do. I had to grind down the inside and buy the tool to do it with, which I didn't mind, but it wasn't the easiest thing to do. I kept grinding away more and more. They say it's suppose to just drop in, but that's only with a few models. I even cut a gash in my hand trying to remove excess, but that was my own fault for being careless, but just know it might take some work. However, the results after are pretty amazing. My rifle shoots great and the Butt Pad actually does the trick. My stock was a little bent in the front, but with a little heating and a lot of patients you can bend that back."
3,"Not bad, but a lot of work.","This stock looks 10 times better than the original for sure. It took HEAVY modification to fit my gun and even then it is not as good as I want. It is almost like the stock is warped. I think it is kind of a gamble when you click ""Add to Cart"" with this Item..."
5,My husband loves it!,"Fits great and it cut down the weight of my husbands gun significantly! Arrived early, and made the gun look better than it already was. Would definitely recommend it."
3,"Good Product, Bad Photo","This is a good quality product as far as the material. However, badge would not fit the predrilled holes in the holder. I had to modify by cutting the leather. Also, beware of the photo; read fine print. The chain does not come with the holder."
1,Waste of Money,This was a waste of money. It is impossible to attach a NYS Parole badge to this product and use it as a clip on.
1,Misleading Picture,The only thing this comes with is the black leather part. No badge and no chain. I was truly dissapointed..
5,Finally found it,I look for this product every time I'm in a new store - never find it anymore. It's the secret to my sour cream chocolate frosting.
1,more bootlegs...*sigh*,"These are bootlegs -the real Japanese versions have a computer accessory with Tomoyo, a Kero, and a piece of heart....Be careful when buying CCS figures and gashapon especially anything shipping from China..."
1,Worst,Worst and inaccurate product ever bought from amazon. It never shows the correct blood pressure. Everytime it shows different. Waste of money
1,Shouldn't have bought this one,"Shows different readings even taken 1 min apart! Our Doctor compared the results with this and traditional one side by side, not reliable..."
4,Hold Cuff at Heart Level,"I bought this for my father and when we checked it against the doctor's office it read high. Then we read the instructions. You MUST hold the cuff at heart level when taking the readings. Any higher or lower will skew the results. We tested high, low, and heart level six times in a row, the heart level readings were nearly identical with the doctor's cuff. The only other drawback is if you use it for multiple readings on a daily scale for a long time then after a while the battery will begin to die and the readings will be off. Other than that it works fine."
2,"Convienient, but not accurate for me","I bought this monitor because it was affordable and I thought it would be an easier and faster way to check my BP regularly. It is easy to use, but I got much different readings than the readings I got from my arm cuff, the Dr and several other sources. I returned it and will stick with what works for me."
1,Not Good,I gave this as a part of the gift to someone and this stopped working barely 20 days later. Lost money and left with shame.I would not recommend this product
1,where is it?,I never recieved this item...it was out of stock for 2 months with promises of delivery every other week. I purchased something else locally. If you have no intentions of restocking an item...you should say so from the beginning!
1,sent it back,"i am a registered nurse and purchased this to replace a wrist bp cuff that no longer worked. since i use it at work prior to giving my patient's bp meds, i need accuracy and dependability....i liked the price ... but when it arrived i could not get it to work, tried two sets of batteries...so sent it back. for a few dollars more i got one at k-mart and it works great..."
3,Uneven results,"I don't think I can really trust the results, coz it's a very sensitive device. I've got to keep the arm very very very steady, and putting it a little loose or tight on write can make a lot of variation in the results.Otherwise I didn't find any problem with this product."
2,Maybe it's me...,"Unlike the other reviews, (which were the reason I chose this monitor) I do not get an accurate reading. This monitor registers so low on me I should be dead (70/40). When I hang my hand at my side, the reading is a bit closer to the doctor's office and the blood bank reading, but still about 20 pts off on both systolic and diastolic. It does seem to be counting my pulse rate accurately."
2,doesn't measure correctly,"unreliable! Abnormally high readings, when i crosschecked my BP with another BP machine it was normal, & this happens ALWAYS!Not a goood product! I want to returnt it now!"
1,lasted 1 dayThis unit lasted,This product quit working after 1 day. I returned and got one for the upper arm.Stan
4,Fitness Mf-83 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,This product was received in a timely fashion and takes my blood pressure in an easier way than other methods. It's seemingly effective and I have used it a few times to monitor the problems that I have had in the past in this area.
4,good product,This is a great little product and very easy to use. I would recommend for the elderly that need to take their pressure often.
3,Good and quick but inaccurate 2/3 times,This is quick and simple to use but the slightest exhale will throw ur numbers off. Other wise I like it!To be sure of the reading test 3 times!
4,Does the job,"We needed a wrist bp monitor, and this does the job with accurate readings. We have had no problems with it so far (owned approx 2 months)"
4,Muy buena calidad,Un producto de muy buena calidad a un precio mas que razonable al compararlo con otros similares. Muy buena garantia y funcionamiento.Recomendable su adquisicion
4,Works Fine,Compared my blood pressure using this wrist monitor to the old fashioned type and it was pretty accurate. It is extremely easy to use and I would buy another one. I have bought these as gifts (different brands) and everyone that has received one has been happy with it. Well worth the price I paid for it.
1,Dangerous,"I read some review said this one read low value , but I got mine, it always reads high. It reads 220/110, when others read 136/90 and allways high at least 60+ when I brought it in Doctor office to comparing. The other reviews said it read low. I think the registration value of it is not accurate and precise. Maybe some customers are lucky, they got accurate ones, but some got the bad one. Anyway, it is dangerous for hypertensive patients, because if they see B/P high, they can take extra dose of antihypertensive medication ===> death."
1,This is not a European plug,"Despite the picture and description stating that this is a European power cord, it is NOT. It is a UK power cord."
1,Plug not as pictured,"NOT a CEE 7/7 plug as pictured, but a british BS1363 plug. Upset I now I have return the several that I purchased and find others."
2,Beautiful but Poor Qualty,I was really excited to get this ring for Christmas since I had it on my wish list for months. It's so pretty but one of the stones fell out within an hour of putting it on for the first time. My parents are returning it and will probably get me another one...hopefully that one holds together.
5,Spring Like Floral Ring,Beautiful quality and light weight to wear. Lovely setting and shiny sterling silver. I wear this ring in the spring and summer. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys colorful floral jewelry. Super quality!
1,unsatisfactory,"This ring is cheap! I loved it until i looked at it real close n saw that the parts holding the stones on didn't seem really in tact. I picked it ONCE, a tiny bit with my fingernail and the stone popped right off! i have to send it back.. :("
4,"Great book for a ""refresher"" in French","Having taken over 10 years of French lessons through elementary and secondary school, I learned the grammar and had a decent vocabulary. However, after 5 years off of French lessons while attending university, I found myself struggling to form even simple sentences.I bought this book because of its many (many!) exercises and complete ""answer key"" for instant feedback. It is organized almost exactly the way I learned it in school which I find very helpful. This book would be very difficult, however, for people with absolutely no background in French. It truly is for the intermediate level.The book does not have much help for people with poor vocabulary skills in French, but it will drill the grammar into you, if you're diligent about regularly doing the exercises. That being said, if you own a dictionary and a verb conjugation book, the combination of those plus ""The Ultimate French Review and Practice"" would be a ***** combination."
5,A fantastic price on a frantastic book!,"If you have already studied French and want to strengthen your skills, this is the book for you. It would also be a good supplementary text for first, second and third year students of college level French. Better than most books that cost twice it's price, it not only gives you clear, well thought-out, and well organized descriptions of all the essential grammar points in French, it also includes copious exercises to drive the points home. This ""workbook"" aspect of the book is an invaluable asset, since once you have understood the grammar point, you still need to practice it a bit make it second nature. I guarantee that if you work you way through this whole book and absorb its contents, you'll have a very good grasp of French indeed. Coupled with something like the Pimsleur courses, a person could get quite fluent is six months of solid daily study."
5,Excellent with Behind the Wheel French,"The Ultimate French Review and Practice by David Stillman is an excellent grammar based reference to learning French.If you really want to speak French, it is best used in my opinion in conjunction with a speaking oriented course which is essentially not grammar based. I have gotten excellent results by combining The Ultimate French Review and Practice with Behind the Wheel French. One compliments the other beautifully."
3,BE CAREFUL! Full of faux pas,"This is generally a good book and helpful. However, my partner is a Parisian-born teacher of French and does not recommend this one to students. He found MANY, MANY mistakes in this book. This is probably why you can find it so cheap all over the internet. It is generally wise to choose a text authored by at least one native speaker (are David Stillman and Ronni Gordon actually French? I doubt it.) Although this book is a good review of grammatical concepts, it may lead you to many faux pas."
2,Hardly the Ultimate,"Although well-organized and comprehensive, the book suffers from several editing errors in both the text and the exercises/answer keys (particularly in the chapter dealing with the future and conditional perfect tenses) and a vocabulary primarily limited to academic settings (which is very limiting indeed). The book should also have been structured in workbook format to allow the student room to record answers; because the book does not fold well, writing answers on a separate piece of paper or laptop is a hassle."
3,Good :),I can't find any better in hk :)Helps a lot in learningClear descriptions n lots of examples :D
4,"good review for grammer, light on vocabulary","I studied in French a few years ago, but haven't used it in quite a while. I picked up this book for a refresher, and have found it to be an excellent review of grammer. The exercises are practical, and the subject matter is relevant (IOW things you might actually hear and say).The book does touch on some vocabulary, but it is assumed that you already have a basic understanding of French.I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has already studied French, and wants to brush up their grammer skills. Not for the beginner or someone who wants to focus on vocabulary."
5,good grammar review for intermediate students,"I had been looking for a French grammar book for some time that offers clear, concise reviews of verb tenses, etc... to brush up on the common mistakes I made. This book offers all that and on top of that, it is the book used in my current French course taught by a native French speaker. The price is hard to beat!"
5,Excellent !,This has worked beautifully for quick references to supplemental written exercises--for not only my students but myself as well!
5,Great book!,"I'll be short, this is a great book, exactly what I was looking for and I am glad I bought it. I am a beginner, studing French at Alliance Francaise and got this book as an additional study at home resource. I like how it is structured and organized: starts with clearly explaining the rule and follows with very good exercises. There are very short, precise to the point explanations of the topic without lenghty, too deep descriptions (thanks to authors). I also got the Ultimate verb review which I like too."
5,The best French grammar review I've seen. Great for refreshing your French!,This book is excellent and has been invaluable to me when trying to refresh my French.
3,"for what i was looking for, it did not do well","it's a great book overall, as it covers most, if not all of the subjects regarding french grammar. but i wished they included indepth information regarding the imparfait usage, passe compose, and plus que parfait. those are the subjects that confuse me the most, this book only gave what i already knew about these subjects.it's good for those in-between beginner and intermediate but for those in the intermediate level, it's not as helpful."
4,maybe to Formal,"jai aprenné ma langue natale (lespañol) sans acune conaisance INSERER>(formel) de sa grammaire et je suis en train--- (seraton tj ""en train""? -mais NON, ojala k no...quantàtoi... -On SaiT JamiaS :) ---de faire kifkif avec le franais. merci cherS monsieurS, mais tu peut garder tes règles de bn usge. étant nat en liberté, je suis libre de suivre (et dEtre suivi poUr le couF racisiste-si NO! :( mon propre chemin, sans un grammaire fasciste pour me éclarcir le chemin (ou plutOt à me tordre la Langue ;)"
5,WOW!!!,"This was an amazing book!!! I will definitely be looking into Mr. Russell`s other books at the library as soon as it opens (I just finished the book, after reading well into the night/morning during a bout of insomnia.)!"
4,Loved it,"This was a good book. Kept moving so didn't get too slow at times. It was not the best of this genre, but it gives good backstory to things in the book to keep the reader entertained."
3,Good but nit Alan Russell's best,This book was good but definitely think burning man was better. Would still recommend it as a read and the identity disorder was an interesting twist.
2,Caveat,"If the names of the characters are mythological derivatives and other similarities abound, you will not be surprised or shocked to spot the bad guys very early. Have I got a swan for you."
1,not for me,"To slow and complicated for my taste. I did not like it, never finished reading, reading and do not think I will go back to it."
2,is it true?,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading through the stories in this book of how individuals and whole peoples have come to faith in Christ through the work of missionaries and the interventions of the Spirit. Outlining the centrality of missions from OT to NT would be very helpful for anyone not familiar with the OT roots of the Great Commission. However, my one major concern is that there is very little documentation of the contemporary stories, statistics, and anecdotes. The book says they can be found on the website, which is not the case. Google searches of some of the quotes, names, and facts in the book produced little to nothing. So while what's presented here is very inspiring, I want to see the documentation and source material before I go around telling people about it or using it in sermons or presentations. Just because it's inspiring doesn't excuse it from being verifiable and documented."
5,love these strings,These strings are really great for my roscoe bass.They really bring out the tone and growl.The price was right.Thanks Bassin J
1,Blueprint reading for building tardes,This was a very disappointing book. Not only can you not see the pictures very well but I didn't find it very informative. I would not buy this book. It's not worth it.
3,just right,just fine - arrived on time and was priced right for the purpose intended - instruction for a trainee associate
2,Impenetrable details - go elsewhere for a basic review,"For brain-taxing details this book is the one. It's right for an architect type, or obsessive contractor. In my case, construction related insurance claims, it was a bit dense and poorly laid out. For basics, not so good. For advanced details, perfectly suitable."
1,WORST GAME EVER,"I don't even know where to begin with how horrible this game was. The makers of this game chose about fifty of the all time worst movies ever and kept asking questions from them. There were actually multiple questions about the movie Under Siege 2!!!!!! Some other favorites: Time Cop, heck any Jean-Clause Van Damme film, In the Mouth of Madness, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen films, etc. Many of the classics that we all know and love were not even used, or if they were, had terrible questions associated with them. I also found a number of mistakes. They couldn't even answer their own terrible questions! Lastly, these morons kept putting the movie title (the answer to the question) in the actual question! Example: ""We're not going to keep the old yeller dog are we?"""
1,Ehhh!,Love movies & any movie trivia game but this was so far fetched. Very hard questions which made it no fun for anyone to play. I think I even had a question from a movie that was based in the 1920's.... Way Before my time! Would not recommend unless you know every movie ever made!
3,"Good reference manual, filled with detailed examples","I found it difficult to read this book as a novice Visual C++ programmer. I assumed it would be a good book for beginners, but I was wrong. It is very difficult to follow, and there was not really any path from beginning to advanced concepts. However, now that I have read a few other beginning Visual C++ books, I have started reading Gregory's book again, and found it more useful the second time around. I enjoy her attention to detail, and the completeness of the sample projects, which are presented one step at a time. I was hoping that the book would have more information on Win32 programming, because I needed to access the system registry, but was disappointed to find very little coverage of ""older"" Windows topics. So I had to look it up in Petzold!Overall, Using Visual C++ 5 is a good addition to my Visual C++ library, but not a good standalone book on the subject."
2,A bit disappointing,"Generally a good introduction, but that's about it. I kind of expected more from a book of this size. I really hate how the author is completely dependent on AppWizard. Some of the chapters get your mouth watering, but then the information stops and continues to something else.A bit disappointing, looks like I'm going to have to find an MFC book to go along with it."
2,wobbly,Cannot get lamp sections to tighten up especially at the base so it is crooked and very shakey.
2,OK outdoor lighting,"This was difficult to put together and the shade is flimsy & cheap looking. It is OK, but I would not put it any higher than that"
2,Wrong Shade for the Lamp.,The outdoor lamp base is great but the shade is not the best fit and the color was GOLD and NOT BEIGE. It does not fit securely on the frame of the shade and the fabric is loose. Thought of contacting the company and asking for the right shade and color that was specified. The base and lamp itself is really nice. After the holidays I may contact them for a new shade.
3,Too expensive for what it does,"Buy several of these and throw them in your humidor for weeks? Why should I pay $12 to season a humidor over the course of 2 weeks? I only bought these because I was new to cigars. They are really neat, but the price is ridiculous over the long haul when compared to just about any other humidification method. I've found that using distilled water in your humidifier (without solution for seasoning) works at least as fast and costs pennies. Besides, my Marshall humidor didn't even require seasoning. The Boveda products are nice but humidisticks cost the same and last at least a year a piece!"
4,"Great Information, Clumsy Presentation","It is an excellent resource if you have already mastered the basics of EI and are looking to take your skills to the next level. The tutorials are excellent. You just wouldn't know by looking at the book and browsing through it.The author really knows his business when it comes to EI. The book is unfortunately written in the same informal, folksy, slang-heavy style as so much other computer-graphics literature. It is also poorly organized. It really could've benefitted from the attentions of a good editor and a technical writer."
1,Ugh...,"Tried to just let the trigger go so that it would stop. It won't stop. It won't power down. It stays on. I opened it up and unplugged the battery, the only way to shut it off. It appears that the little pop-up that acts as the power mechanism is jammed in the on position.That sure didn't last long. One simple button press and it's broken. Returning for a full refund."
1,older was better,"Ths was a replacement for a five year old unit that had given many hours of fun to the grandkids. This unit did not work right from the start. The on- off stuck, power cut off, then it just stoped. I may try the next step up but am concerned pool use with kids."
1,Crap,"Used this product one time, and it never worked again. Do not buy this product it is a piece of crap. I will never buy a Sea Doo product ever again."
1,Def Not,"they set the item incorrectly, so price was all messed up. its too tiny has peg legs is not even worth wasting my time to type this, do not deal with this company selling it Horrible!"
5,Great Family Game,"I played this game and immediately wanted to play it again. It is a game that you can decide how hard or easy the game can be. It is up to you. I played with adults, and we all loved it and played it all night. I then played with my children, they loved it because it is a game they can learn about geography or people, and easy enough for them to play. I highly recommend this game for any age, and for everybody. Lots and lots of fun. A definite must to get."
3,Facts and facts only!,"This biography of St. Margaret Clitherow is exhaustive as far as giving the facts, as they are known, about her life. But there is no flow, no life behind the words. It is a technical reporting of facts with little attempt to make St. Margaret come alive. The author can be credited with being exacting with her research, however, and this book would be a great research tool. Just don't expect an inspirational feel!"
4,Not A Story Book,"When I read it to my two daughters 7 and 8 they say it was more informational than a story book. It makes a great informational book with a little humor. I would recommend this book for a child 7 and older to read and learn about all different types of fairies. I could not see a five year old loosing interest really quickly or being over their head because it goes so into detail about the different types of fairies and the vocabulary. In addition, some of the words are in cursive."
1,Un-restored Max Fleischer Color Classics,"Except for the first cartoon, The Wizard Of Oz, the rest of these are classic Max Fleischer Color Classic Cartoons. But instead of buying this cheap un-restored disc, I would steer you to VCI's ""DANCING ON THE MOON"" DVD which features almost every Max Fleischer Color Classic Cartoon in restored prints (some from 35mm)."
3,Guts required for this technique,"Two basic techniques are recommeded here: 1) Placing the 6 & 8 and continually doubling your bet until either the 6 or 8 is hit. For myself, this technique is too hard on my nerves. A typical progression would $12-12 on the 6 & 8, then $30-30, then $60-60, then $120-120. If either the 6 or 8 hit, start over. I do like the come bet system. This system requires you to add to your bets only when you are winning. This author claims that he makes some serious money using these techniques. I don't have the nerve to try the steep progressions that he recommends. Maybe you do."
1,dont get scammed,I have bought several publishings from this company. Each publishing is a endless circle of telling you to buy another one of there publishings. They offer a 100% garuntee and dont honor it. If you email them they might respond once and tell you that your refund was submitted to your credit card and it is your credit card companies fault you have not got your refund. Dont be scammed like me and many others. Never purchase any publishings by Martin J. Silverthorne.
1,Very Light on Information,"I read a lot of non-fiction books. Recently I have read a lot of books on Navigation, Boating and Fishing (over 20 books in 6 months). I could say that of these books every book had something that I felt, ""I have never heard that before. That is a great technique or idea. I have to remember that."".Fishing the Long Island Coast was totally absent of that kind of information. It felt contrived and drawn-out. It certainly felt that the Freshwater section was thrown-in as an afterthought when they realized that the format chosen for the book yielded a very short manuscript.The fact that there is a section dedicated to the various fish species that could be found off Long Island just shows the audience this books may be valuable to (someone who has no fishing background).My parting comment is; why include driving directions to each of the ""hotspots""? There are certainly other, better sources of driving directions. Describe fishing to me, not driving."
3,"OK Guide, But Lite on Info","I was looking forward to this book, but after reading it I must say I was disppointed. This book is a good attempt, and may be valuable to some who may be brand new to fishing, but it is really lacking in dept. It does a disservice to one of the most productive fishing areas on the coast. Compare this to ""Fishing the New Jersey Coast"" and you will know what I mean. That is the way it should be done. With all due respect to the 5 star review given, do you work for the author?"
4,Lot of locations,I just finished reading this book and was happy with the amount of information provided for all the locations around the Island. Some of the info I already new but some I didn't. I am looking forward to trying out some of the spots Tom highlighted. This book didn't go into a lot of How-to but I didn't think it was going to anyway. Well worth the read. Can't wait for spring.
4,Nice Value,Purchased online for $150 and then found a set of Portbello at Ross for $79 the next day. Probably should have waited...
2,Leaky pots beware,The pots are fine as long as you don't fill them to the rivets. Some of the pots leak at the rivets. So far two have started leaking. I have had the pots for 2 months. I will investigating the warranty process after the holidays. Pretty disappointing!
5,"Great buy, everything you should look for in cookware","I got this set half price on through Amazon warehouse deals, and they arrived in beautiful shape. Everyone should get rid of their Teflon based non-stick cookware, as it releases poisons and toxins. When the nonstick wears off, you'll have to use sprays, which make the release of toxins even worse.This set is dishwasher safe, and it has an a copper and aluminum base, which is encapsulated in stainless steel. So you don't have to worry about those metals getting into your food, but they are great and distributing the heat.Every once in awhile, I put a dash of baking soda and vingar in the bottom to polish up the inside bottom to a nice shine. Very durable construction. Definitly not cheap feeling in the least. Great buy, even at $200."
2,Leaking Rivets,"Received pots a few days ago and with first use water was leaking out of the rivets in the pan. Tested the rest by boiling water in them and found they all had leaking rivets where the handles attached. Returning item and looking elsewhere.Quite unfortunate, as these are nice looking, good cooking weight and induction-safe."
3,Not bad for the price,"The most important thing I would say is to wash them prior to using them if you don't the coating they put on them to protect them will stain them. I have been using them for about a month and I do like them but...the sides are very thin, I was expecting something more substantial. Also when they heat up they make a cracking sound, as if the bottom parts are separating. I do like the fluted sides, it makes it easy to toss. They also clean up nicely. I would also like to say that I am not happy with the handles on the skillets and smaller pots; they are too skinny and makes it hard to pour things out of them. You will need both hands, they do stay cool though. My biggest concern is the noise, it makes me think they will not last long. Hopefully I will be proven wrong. At the same time I bought this set I also bought a ""Cook's"" brand 10"" skillet with fluted sides and I really like it."
4,"Great quality pans, and they nest for storage!","This is the pan set that I purchased to replace my 26 yr. old Revere Ware that I received when I got married. Wonderful! They have triple ply bottoms that distribute heat well, the stainless steel surface is great for browning and cleans well, and they have glass lids you can see through. Best of all, in my opinion, is that the slanted shape of the pots allows them to nest inside one another nicely for storage. The whole set, together with the large saute pan that I purchased separately, stack up in two neat piles in the pantry. Absolutely love it. The price is very reasonable for the quality of the product."
2,failed on induction cooktop,"I bought it to use on my new Kitchenaid induction cooktop. The smallest sauce pan wouldn't work on the induction cooktop (base too small) and the next two larger sizes gradually debonded in the base such that they won't conduct heat to cook, but the bottom layer will heat up to marr the glass cooktop surface. The fry pans are small, but at least they are still working.The ""No-hassle"" warranty is a big hassle and useless."
1,So disappointed!,"I ordered this set to replace my worn Calphalon set and it took only a week for me to pull my old set out of the trash and dump these. The appearance is lovely and I was so excited to use these stainless steel pots and pans. The pots are okay, but the pans are terrible. Everything sticks, no matter how much you adjust the temperature or grease the pans and they are a nightmare to clean. They are also small and I needed to order an extra, larger pan to sautee a normal meal for 2. I wish I could return these and get my money back, I expected so much more for what I paid. Thoroughly unsatisfied!"
3,Not all that impressed.,"The pans look nice and clean up easily enough, but the base of the pans quickly began to separate from the rest as the metal swelled and contracted between uses."
1,Do not waste your money on this item,The lid handles become super hot and if you are not careful you can sustain serious burn injury on your fingers.
4,Great set of pots,"We had this set of pots for several months now. They are well-made and look very pretty. And they are easy to clean. I use these pots all the time.My only complain is that the bottom of the pots are smaller than the pots of the same size, so two of the small pots only work on one of the induction cooktop ""burner""."
4,Induction cookware,"I purchased this set for my new induction stove. For the money, this cookware is much heavier than expected and well constructed. I am pleased with its performance so far. My only complaint is that the small saucepan is too small to fit any of the elements on my stove and I would have liked a larger frypan with a lid included. All in all, a good buy."
4,Awesome,"As a military member with not a lot of time, these pans are awesome. Very light, making heat up time quick as well as easy to maneuver around the stove. Stainless construction makes it very easy to clean. Copper bottom makes for no hotspots and even cooking. Very solid construction, recommend keeping frying pan next to headboard when not in use(home defense.)Made Alfredo sauce in pan; no burning, no sticking, just good even heat. Pan handles wick heat away making it safe to pick up without a towel.Big pot handles, as well as the lid handles get hot quite easily, will need oven mitts or a kitchen towel when lifting lids or pot.All in all great price. Have had other sets for same price that don't compare."
4,new pans for mom,I really enjoy cooking on this set of pans. It has taken a little getting use too and now I enjoy it.
4,Great part of history!,"This is a fun book with a variety of outhouses around the state of Colorado. This is a part of our history and how we have progressed. Thank Goodness!Wonderful pictures in the book.Wray, CO fan"
5,"To me (well, us) it's only Roudybush!","I've had my parrots for 20 years, and we (well, they :) have tried all sorts of pellets with fruity colors and goofy shapes, as well as a couple of pellet types that were actually high quality with excellent ingredients, but my parrots wouldn't accept them.A balanced parrot diet inclues more than just pellets, but this is a foundational item that I think most every parrot-parent will need.Roudybush pellets are an excellent, excellent product that I know has helped support the health of my amazon parrots over the years. They love them and clamor for them every night."
2,"Good ""Bathroom"" Reading, But Otherwise Stale","Having grown up as the son of an insurance lawyer, I certainly have heard some weird tales from the legal profession. I have also seen my fair share of books about wacky laws and stupid things said by lawyers, judges and plaintiffs.I was hoping this would be another funny book, but it really wasn't. Not many of the entries are funny and the author writes as if he were writing a writ. Much of the material comes from 16th century England, and doesn't translate well into modern times.If you're looking for a good ""back of the toilet"" book, this is by all means good bathroom reading. It is not, however, worth the price to sit down and read."
4,"Challenging at times, yet hours of fun.","This is one of the best games I have bought for my son. He is 5 years old and loves educational games like this. While, it may not teach ABC's it helps hand-eye coordination, quick reflexes, and thinking ahead. There were areas my son needed help with, but for the most part he could figure out how to do the activities."
2,Explanations Please!,"No complaints about the puzzles being challenging, but I bought this not only to be challenged but to learn. If you don't understand why you got a question wrong, you are out of luck because there is now explanation why the answer is the answer..... for all I know Nathan Haselbauer (author) doesn't know either, but he doesn't want to let me know.I've decided the author is more lazy than smart-- otherwise he would have provided a way for me to learn instead of just trust him."
4,Simple-to-understand examples,The closest book I have found so far to Luenberger's optimizationin linear vector spaces. There are good simple to understand examplesto some classic problems like Dido's problem using functional analytictechniques. Proofs are easy to follow and the text is not replete withhyper-technicalities that are of no issue in problems. Also included areexamples from control theory. Groetsch is an excellent writer which makesup for the completely unforgivable typesetting.
4,ACE neoprene elbow support.,"Very good product, but selecting the correct size is a problem.I was fortunate that I had already purchased this product for a local drugstore so I knew what size to select."
2,Gluten free?,"The peanut balls taste delicious; however, I purchased them because I have celiac disease (am gluten intolerant) and they were advertised as gluten free. When I ate them, I had a gluten reaction. I gave them several tries and the same thing continued to happen. When reading the fine print, the package stated that they were manufactured in a facility that also manufactures items containing wheat. The possibility of cross contamination should have been included in the description of the product. I never would have purchased them if I'd known that."
1,"""organic agave juice"" is not what you think!","""Organic agave juice"" is the first thing on the ingredient list for this snack. Agave juice is hydrolyzed high fructose Inulin Syrup, which has a similar metabolic effect as high fructose corn syrup. So if you are avoiding high fructose syrups, don't let the use of the term ""organic"" lull you into a false sense of security."
3,Here we go again....,"Why is it that there aren't any reliable weather instruments in this price range? This is yet another of those exasperating devices that issue continuously from the Orient (oops -- Asia) with inscrutable instructions, erratic behavior, and maddening complexity.Yes, it works -- sort of and sometimes. The outside temp & humidity displays on mine -- or not -- seems to be entirely on how it feels at the moment. The barometric pressure depends on altitude, of course, but I gave up trying to set that -- I just compensate mentally. Even changing from millibars to inches mercury is a puzzle.Ok, so it does a few things well. And it works most of the time. Not bad enough to return, not good enough to be happy. As Casey Stengal said of the first NY Mets: ""Can't ANYONE play this game?""<sigh>"
2,Not for high altititude,I just received my Honeywell Weather time barometric weather forecaster. A big 'Thank You' to all the previous buyers who had advice on set-up. That helped until I discovered the unit will not register altitude above 3999'. That means I will never have an accurate reading on this unit. I live at 5240' above sea level.Honeywell TE653ELW Portable Barometric Weather Forecaster
3,Honey Well Weather Station,I got the Honeywell Weather station to replace the one that did not function after 3-4 moves and 4-5 years. The Honeywell instruction manual does not have the info for changing the time zone. Make sure that the day is by the time and press the up button (several seconds each time). I learned that from another review for this station. The Station is working well and am having no problems with it.
1,does not retain outside temps,"I purchased the TE653W along with 2 TE529W atomic weather stations 2 years ago mostly because they rated the outside temps to go to 40 below F and most others only go to 4 below. I have been very disappointed with both models and even sent one back to the company and they replaced it with a new one but still the same results. I have 4 different remotes with one only a foot away and 2 not more than 10 feet away just throught a window. They just cannot retain the outside temps. I have a atomic clock radio with indoor outdoor temp, HoMedics brand that has worked perfect for the last 5 years but only goes to 4 below. I get temps to 40 below where I live, and like to see the outside temp before I get out of bed!!!"
3,weather,We like this weather station for it's price. The only issue that we have with it is the temperature alarm goes beeps wether it is turned off or not. Other than that it has been good.
1,do NOT buy,"You will be very grateful NEVER to purchase this item. Some of the functions simply would not allow themselves to be set up correctly. When I finally got some feedback from the company, their ""fixes"" did not work. I never could set either elevation or time zone. I would give this zero stars if possible."
3,Atomic clock not for Hawaii,"The Honeywell TE653ELW works great, but since I live in Hawaii the atomic clock is a problem. The time zone does not allow for Hawaii, so occasionally the time resets to California time. There's not way to turn off the atomic clock. So I can't trust the clock to be an alarm clock since the time signal from California is occasionally received in Hawaii. Otherwise works great."
2,75% works,"The Honeywell TE653ELW Complete Weather Forecaster with Indoor/Outdoor Temperature and Humidity is great to look at, works really well; however, it has one drawback--the inability to change to the correct time zone. Instructions--both in the accompaying instruction book and online--do not provide for changing the time zone. When the time is viewed here on the east coast--3 hours must be added for it to be correct. It's not a serious problem once it's understood; however, accurate time really is preferred."
2,"Some good, some not so good","Overall, this is a decent product. It's got not only interior temp and humidity but exterior temp, humidity, and barometric pressure. My biggest complaints are I haven't figured out how to change time zones on the automic clock (defaulted to Western but I'm in Central), and the forecast feature is probably not too accurate - it didn't forecast snow when we had 12 inches over 20 hours."
1,Total dissatisfaction,"It was impossible to set time zone following instructions in manual. I know there is advice from other users how this can be accomplished, but why should I bother when the manufacturer's own instructions don't work, especially when the screen is too crowded and hard to read anyway. I do credit the vendor with prompt and courteous response to my return-for-refund request (a 3rd party vendor, not Amazon)."
5,Fabulous follow up,"This is the second book we have by Gillian Duffy and it is just as fantastic as her first, Hors d'oeuvres. The layout is simple and the pictures are great. We plan on using it as a holiday gift for many of our friends.Bravo Gillian - we cannot wait to get cooking."
5,A Crucial Antidote to the Standardization of our Children,"I have been a fan of Dr. Markova's positive approach for years, since I first read HOW YOUR CHILD IS SMART. Here she puts it all together to show parents exactly how to foster their child's potential. She helps you identify your child's unique talents and use their gifts to overcome the challenges they face. Whether you have a child doing faboulously in school or one who is struggling in this standaradized world, this book is an absolute necessity for every parent wanting to bring out the best in their child."
3,sigh,"Not all practices work for all people.""Drugging"" my ADD child keeps him from failing every class he takes. My son has amazing strengths, an IQ that got him Mensa membership at 14 - BUT - due to ADD, OCD, and arthritis he needs prescribed medications to have the necessary focus to 1-not lose completed major assignments, 2- remember to bring a book home before the school is locked for the night, 3- look in his English folder for his English report, instead of wondering where he put it thus getting a zero... or, to be able to utilize his strengths and reach his full potential.For my non ADD/OCD/arthritis children - this is a great book!!!"
2,Where's my review?,"I had a lengthy review of this book that I posted a few months ago here for this book. Within the past few days it disappeared.The review did say some negative things but also contained positive remarks, too. It certainly contained nothing profane or libelous. And 19 out of 39 people found the review helpful. Now it's gone, and I did not remove itI only gave the book 2 stars though, which had made the overall collective review a star less than the full stars. Now the review has mysteriously disappeared & the overall review is now up to a full 5 stars again. Who is responsible for this?"
4,I like Lightnin',"Mainly I bought this CD for YOU BETTER WATCH YOURSELF... Although a decent version, not really as great as the other version (also done by Lightnin') I heard on satellite radio. Am still trying to nail down that other version--because it is absolutely one unforgetable blues tune.In any event, Lightnin' Hopkins is the real thing--and I will be buying more of this blues legend's music."
4,Great Read,A really good book. The plot of this book concerns a underground group that works to stop a genocidal plot against black people. The book was written in 1998 but the portions that concern biological weapons are timely.
5,Truth in characters,"I loved this book. The characters are crafted so honestly and realistically. The story line is not too dramatic and the author does not fill the need to write elaborate events, she instead writes elaborately large and implied between the line emotions within every little moment. This book is a great solid account of life, and I would recommend it to people of any age or gender."
4,Somethings happened now I'm head over heels...,"Keeping with my new tradion... I'm only giving out 4's instead of 5 becuase, only the best most amazing album in the world deserves a 5 and after the thought and consideration that it takes to decide, the album just didn't do it. Not that it isn't bad... it's tottally awesome (brah) and that means... whoa! You know that feeling, whoa! It is a beast of an album... many parts many but that is the problem too many parts and another complaint... unless your using Winmx or something you won't get these songs cuase this is outta print... come on guys your big now, repress the damn thing! And I haven't got an email for a month now, email me guys (I""m on an email basis with these bros, get on an email basis with me, I'm devoted to email) Goodbye"
5,I good christian band?,I almost wrote Underoath off when my friend told me they were christian but once he put it in the cd player I found out that they were indeed an excellent metalcore band. If you are hesitant to listen just give it a try you will be pleasantly suprised. Also check out .hopesfall.
3,"Good, Not Great, and Hardly The Best","Like most short story collections, ""The Best Time Travel Stories of the 20th Century"" is uneven. There are classic Twilight Zone-like tales such as Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder"" and Richard Matheson's ""Death Ship."" There are also a few stories that I found almost unreadable and yet here they have been included in this anthology with the word ""best"" in the title.This is not a great collection of stories, but it is a great collection of writers. Maybe by reading this book you'll get acquainted with a writer you haven't come across or maybe you'll enjoy a true classic like ""Sailing to Byzantium"" for the first time."
3,Good Stories but Missing One,"This book does have some of the best time travel stories of all time. But the title is a lie. It does not have the best time travel stories of the 20th Century. Robert Heinlein's ""By His Bootstraps"" would have to be included for it to truthfully claim such a lofty title."
3,Good collection,"This is a nice little collection of time travel stories, although it should have included other gems of the genre to merit the title 'best'."
2,Damning omission,"The absence of Bester's ""The Men Who Murdered Mohammed"" is alone enough to invalidate the title."
3,Fair at best,I've been a Sci-Fi fan for well over 50 years now and have read many time travel tales. While there were several in this collection that were very good most definitely did not measure up to the best of the 20th century.
4,Really?,"It's called The Best Time Travel Stories of the 20th Century and yet it does NOT include Robert Heinlein's ""All You Zombies..."", or as someone else pointed out, his ""By His Bootstraps"" - two essential time travel stories.Sorry. It fails to live up to its title. Other than that gaping hole, it's a better than average collection. By still, not the best."
4,Very Nice.,Could use a heavier base. Sometimes the wind blows it over. It has turned a nice patina since I placed it outside.
3,Nice Looking - Average Sturdiness,"The hamper looks great! No question about it. The problem with it is that the screws/bolts that come with it don't seem to be able to keep it sturdy enough. Maybe a bad design - maybe bad hardware. Regardless, after 1 year it is still together and working fine."
5,Classic tv by a classy cast,"This is my favorite season. Glad to be able to watch it again, thanks to Prime streaming. One of the best shows ever."
5,Glad this available,It's amazing how relevant all this is over a decade after it first aired. The acting and writing is top notch and the stories still interesting. It's a pleasure to be able to revisit this old friend again.
5,Really wonderful series,"I didn't watch this series when it was first broadcast, so have been delighted to encounter it online since. What wonderful scripting and ensemble cast! It's very well done and educational about the speed and multiplicity of issues that come to bear in our legislative and governmental process. It's always about so much more than the actual issue seemingly on the table. The West Wing provides a useful civics lesson each episode as well as pure entertainment for those who prefer theirs with a literate bent. I heartily recommend this."
5,A wonderful explanation of Feng Shui.,"Anyone who enjoys feng shui and cats will love the humor in this book.Even if you don't like cats, this book is well written enough to explain feng shui concepts to the most novice practitioner.I have dabbled with feng shui for a few years and even learned a few pointers in here not covered in more advanced books."
5,Double Play At Short,"I think the book Double Play At Short was a very good book. Matt Christopher is the author of this book, he writes many sports books. This was a book I couldn't put down because I was curious of what was going to happen next.The characters were just like people I know. They acted the same way and had the same hobbies. This book is about a kid named Danny. He makes it to the championship series of his baseball league when he gets very mysterious of someone on the other team. He takes pictures of her and does a lot more to figure out who she is. If you read this book, you will find out what happens next. I think this book would be a very good book for any ages to read, whether it's an adult or kid. That's how much I think other people would enjoy this boook as much as I did."
4,It was a GREAT book,I liked the story because of a boy who plays baseball and encounters a girl. Ho has many similarities and he wants to find out more about her. His mom tells him that she is his twin and his mom died at birth. The boy's team faces his sister in the championship. His sister knows that they are twins and they both play ther best and he and his sister have a geat time after the game.
3,The 2 Baseball Players,"The book was about an adopted boy named Danny Walker that had played short stop and wanted to make the all-star team. But, there is a new girl named Tammy who bats and fields just like him. In the end Danny realizes something familiar about Tammy. I thought the book was interesting and exciting because once you read some you want to read some more!"
5,Jacks book review,"My name is Danny I love to play baseball.The next day was A baseball game with the Jaguars the championship game. Danny plays shortstop all the time.My teamates are Joel,Elane,Franky and Ike.His best friend is Joel he plays baseball with Danny Elane too.The first game was won by us the Bullets.The second game we lost 6-4. I think the book was A good book.Matt Christopher is A good author."
5,Double Play at Short,"This book is funny, heart breaking, and depressing. Young Danny is playing in a world series with his twin sister. He doesn't know that she's his sister yet. I give it 5 stars. It's the best book ever besides Harry Potter."
4,Does what it is supposed to..,"I purchased this item to use for installing plastic bullnose corners. (something not available in my area and had to be specially ordered). If I were to purchased again, I would look for a wider outside trowel as the corner seemed slightly larger than the trowel purchased and we had to wipe mud with a rag. No big deal because this tool was a huge help and I don't see how this job could be done without one."
4,A new author finds his voice....and we're the better for it.,"I usually shy away from first time authors with self-published works.However, the author's email and follow-up correspondence were so clear and concise that I decided to give this one a chance. I'm glad I did.Nelson Aspen is an author to watch. I'm sure he'll find an agent and a publisher after the word gets around about his story-telling abilities. SACRED BLOOD is a great story, well-told, and peopled with characters who face great difficulties.Ann Gunter, an unwed pregnant teen-ager at the height of Hitler's domination, finds herself in the French countryside at Chateau Blanche, the Nazi's own personal baby factory.Her journey through the maze of Nazi lies and trechery forces Anna to grow up fast and face the horrors of a world gone mad.I read this book in one sitting and I look forward to more from Aspen. He's got a great voice....and hopefully, more stories to tell.Enjoy!"
1,Unrelentingly Dull !!,"This was a poorly plotted novel with leaden dialogue and paper-thin character development. The story line wasn't remotely plausible, and the ending was predictable !! Gee, wish there was something nice I could say about Mr. Girly Man's Book, but I can't think of a single thing. Mr. Girly Girl has apparently been living in California too long!"
1,This product has a very short lifespan!,"This hotplate worked three times -- and then it died. I had a hotplate that worked for six or seven years before this -- no problems. This ""Elite"" looked just fine when I got it out of the box. And, as I say, it worked fine -- once, twice, three times but, during the third usage, its light went out and it was gone to hotplate heaven. Multiple tries, multiple wall receptacles, letting it cool down, etc., etc. -- it was done for. I sent it back and, needless to say, I did NOT request a replacement."
3,Heats up Quickly,"This hot plate heats up very quickly. I use it for melting wax for candle making. It does get really hot on the underside, so it needs to have a cutting board and trivet under it. It will ruin a table top, or any surface that is not heat resistant."
1,The burner initially worked very well.,"When I opened the package, I noted that the burner was a compact and attractive appliance. At first it functioned beautifully, heating very quickly and efficiently, but, unfortunately, after three weeks of minimal use, the burner completely stopped working!"
3,"Works great,for a while,now it doesn't work.","No problems here.Works way better then the old one I've been using for the last few years.Even heat,heats up fast.Up date;:quit working didn't last 1 year.Got a black & decker that works much better for the same price."
3,Seems to kick out,Bought this to pop popcorn in the basement and it works great. Seems to kick out if set on the highest setting for too long.
3,Broke: Not Broke,The first Eliste Cuisine Single Cast Burner arrived. It didn't work---Let's call it Broken. 2nd one was sent as a replacement. It works!!! Heats up relatively quickly for a 1000 watt device. Does the job. For the $ it is sufficient.
5,"Works perfectly for cooking, too!","After reading the reviews, I was skeptical but for no reason. The hotplate works great!It looks like boiling water seems to be the yardstick so let me tell you that I had a 4-qt pot which would come to a full rolling boil in about 10-15 minutes. The thermostat also worked great, I would leave stews on a low heat for hours and they would simmer without burning.I don't think I'd try to boil 20 qts - it isn't designed for that.I got this hot plate to use for 10 days in a hotel room - and I had decided that I wasn't going to spend hundreds of $ to eat out every day so would simply cook. I went to the supermarket, got what I needed and saved so much money. If you decide to do this, make sure you have a window in the room (or you'll need to cook in the bathroom) :P"
2,Not powerful enough,"I tried to use this for cast iron skillet on my balcony. This unit was simply did not produce enough heat to do that task. $20 burner is too cheap, I should have known better. It's going to the dumpster."
2,Nasty smell & smoke,"This burner does seem to heat up quickly, as other reviewers have noted. The light on it turns off when the burner reaches the temperature you've set--which is probably supposed to be a feature, but for me it worries me a bit just because there's no other indication that the burner is on. That's different from my other hot plate, though I could live with the difference now that I know. But my main problem with this item is that some chemical on the burner cover heats up and smokes. That chemical also *stinks*. It's made me a little worried about eating something cooked on this burner, and it looks like a layer of the burner cover itself has started rubbing off on my pans. Not good!"
2,Good burner but with critical defect (perhaps just mine),"I've been looking for a good portable burner and because of it's good reviews and price, bought this burner.Right away, we noticed one part of the burner plate was corroding/flaking. As long as it didn't get worse, I wanted to use it because of its good heating performance.However, after second use, there was more flaking around the plate top. We were just heating some soup in a stainless pot.I had to return the item. And I'm still looking for a good burner to buy..."
1,Worked Well... When It Worked!,"Had this little gem for about 10 months; used it less than 10 times (probably five or six times) and two nights ago, it stopped working... Good thing the food was done by then or I'd have to rate it less than ""one star"" for the cost of the wasted food. Wish I'd seen these other one-star reviews before I purchased mine last January 2010. Pass on this item."
1,Low Quality,"I have used two similar portable burners bought from walgreens in last two years. both fail within few months. I am so disappointed with the quality of the product selling in walgreens. so I went online search for a better one and find this one cheap and has decent ratings. Bought it and tried it out. It works perfect initially (better than the ones from walgreens). however, it suddenly stop working one day after using less than two weeks. very disappointed. Ironically, now a day this kind of non-hightech products can be more unreliable than hightech products."
3,Honest opinion,"The fit and finish makes this a stout device. It has a somewhat small surface area and is not capable of reaching ""very"" high temperatures that you might otherwise get from your average stove top."
1,Won't last,This is Junk....Burned out in less than a month.....Cost too much to return..So I trashed it !!!!! I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,knobless in boston,"The first time that I used this product, the knob fell off. The burner also takes a long time to heat water. I'm not sure if I received a lemon or this is customary. Good luck in your purchase."
1,poor quality,"i used it for two days before it broke down. really disappointing. poor quality. i really want a burner, but not one that stopped working in two days."
4,Sufficient,"It is slow to heat up and cool down, but I am sure that is a limitation of of the 110v power source, not the design. It's no 220v stove-top eye, but it is sufficient and easy to clean."
3,"It's Okay, doesn't get very hot.","The light will always turn off when you are cooking, probably because it has reached its temperature limit. It takes a long time to cook anything besides eggs."
1,Not quality like all other cheap models,"I am now ordering the waring because like all other cheap models , this shuts off too early to boil water.Also it puts off a noxious odor and I tried keeping it on for 2 hours to cook it all off and still did not work."
1,Worked once!,"Worked great one time - then nothing .... don't buy!!!!! I would give it zero stars, but that is not available."
4,hotplate,I would recommend this product to anyone. It doesn't take long for your food to heat up. I have used other similar products and prefer this one over the other brand.
4,Very good but could be the plate could be a half inch larger....,"I have had five versions of single burners over the last few years. I mostly use them to keep soups and other foods warm for serving since my gas stove does not regulate well for that purpose.Other than a huge and expensive Broil King, this burner has been the best. The heat regulation is very good and the coating on the cast iron is very easy to clean (unlike the Broil King which eats up cleaning utensils).I prefer this unit because of its compact size in my limited space.The plate itself is rather small...a 2 quart sauce pan will extend a little around the edges of the burner."
1,Previously used and/or defective assembly,"Opened box to find: The packaging foam was in broken pieces, the top of the burner plate was actually crumbling off exposing rust, the item was not even wiped clean from previous use and/or defective assembly. I can not rate the item on performance since I am immediately returning it to the seller."
1,Only worked one time,"I bought this for cooking. It worked good the first time that I used it. The second time that I tried, it kept turning itself on and off, even though I had the power switch on high. I read that this happened to some other customers. Save yourself some trouble, buy something else."
4,"good, but smells at first","Be aware that the first couple of times you use this you'll need to open a window to get rid of the fumes. It took about forty-five minutes of operation for the smell to go away, but after that break-in period it's served me well.Gets hot reasonably fast and I've had no trouble boiling a medium-sized pot of water or sauteing a pretty big pan of veggies.I like that the burner itself is a solid piece of metal rather than a coil because pans sit evenly on the burner. The whole thing is pretty heavy, which is good for stability. It sits higher up than some other burners so it has a decent amount of space for air to flow under it, helping with heat dispersion."
4,"4 star, does not heat large pot of water to a boil for pasta.","Bought this in August when we lost power for a week. I was able to use this with our generator to cook our meals & now have it in our camper. I prefer an electric burner over the gas stove in the camper for safety reasons.It is pretty good for the price.With a small or medium pot or pan, I can cook things nicely.I've made just about anything I can make on the regular stove top on this. I do have to watch the temperature so things don't burn more than I do with the regular stove top burner.It does not however heat up a large pot of water enough to boil pasta. That is a huge disappointment, but what can I expect for $20? The bottom seems to get quite warm, I am cautious about where I put this when using it.Overall, I am very pleased with this item. It works reasonably well, it was cheap, it cleans up easily, and it is compact and easy to store."
3,Hot Plate,"Seems to compare to other hotplates. Bought because It matches one I have and can use both together, because of matching height. Would recommend."
3,Hot under the collar,"For the price, it is ""ok"".But what confuses me is, for the same price the design changes I would want would make it way better.- I wish the whole top surface was made of the heating coil, not that it does not deliver the heat, but then it would be easy to clean! Right now you have that extra chrome ring that gets ugly fast. In fact, if they made it smart enough, one could make this device blend in better with everything else. Visual noise is a big problem for me.- On/Off knobs. I find that most places need COUNT DOWN TIMERS, and this device begs for one!But, yeah, it works."
2,Too hot to handle,This burner takes too long to heat water and stays hot far too long after turning off. I would not recommend this burner if you have small children or elderly around .
4,Nice burner for those times when you need heat and don't want to use the kitchen stove.,I wanted something to boil water and dye for coloring fiber. This really works well. I can do the work in my basement and not work about messing up my floors and counters with fiber dye.
4,Single Cast Burner,Single Cast Burner works great and is easy to use. I used it for a library program to heat up oils for making homemade lip balm and can't wait to test it out again.
2,No Heat Control,"I waited too long to send this back ... but I want folks to know the problem. The surface of this grill is solid, it's not like the winding eye on a stove. Because of this, it (and the whole frame) heats up fast and takes a long tome to lose any heat. Say ... you want to make some noodles. It will boil on medium (don't turn it on high for sure). Now you want to simmer for 10min. Well, that's not gonna happen. Even if you turn it off and unplug it, it's gonna boil for at least five more minutes ... noodles like paste! I guess if you're just gonna heat some soup it would be OK ... but you still will most likely burn the goodies. In short .. it works fine but is unable to control the temp AT ALL. I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than boiling water or heating something simple."
2,thermostat ticked off too early,"bought this for using with Chinese hot pot. received it in the mail and setup hot pot with water to test out if it will bring and hold an easy low simmer/boil. it did not do this. the thermostat ticked off too early, even on the highest setting, to even get the water any where near boiling. the burner was indeed hot, it just wasn't working for my application."
1,Bigger Rip-off than the Slots!,"A ridiculously inflated price for a 1/4 inch book that can be read in less than an hour. Contains a few basic common sense suggestions (Like don't play in the toilet. Duh!), a lot of suggestions that you buy more books that they've published, and some odd betting progressions which don't make sense. If you walk away from a machine that's not winning, which is basic common sense, that is what is cutting your loses... not the betting progression. This book reads like it was written for someone that has never played slots before and contains far too many veiled advertisements for my tastes."
5,"If you want to win, this is the book you need!","Wow! I have never read a book on slot machine playing strategies like this one. Most slot machine books have information about how the machines work and a bunch of stories about slot machine players. But they never get around to telling how to play and win at slots.Advantage Slots leaves out the entertaining stories and focuses on several proven slot machine winning strategies. I have tried two of the strategies out with good results. The first one resulted in enough winnings to pay for my trip to Las Vegas. The second system I am still evaluating, but it is winning regularly and I am very pleased. Because of the information in this book I have become a consistent winning slots player!If you want to win, the strategies presented in this book are better than anything I have ever seen.You decision here should be simple. If you want to know exactly how to profit from slot machine play, buy this book."
5,My Grandson Loved It,Nice looking sturdy book. Fun to have. Easy to read with colorful pictures. He should have hours of fun .
5,Grandkids love it.,The grandkids and I enjoy reading this book And it's handy to take along on little field trips. Great little book.
2,Turk 182,"Love the movie, however, the quality of the tape is lacking. The movies has several parts that have lines through it which make it impossible to see."
5,A Feel Good Movie !!!,"This movie is by far my husbands favorite movie! He has watched it numerous times. I can't get him away from the TV set when it is on. I really wish they would put this movie on DVD because it rightly deserves to be there. It is a great movie. It has everything a movie needs action, drama, excitement and any other words I could think of other than GREAT !!! Maybe someday they will put it on DVD and we will get a clearer picture. I definately would buy it in a heartbeat! Once you watch it you will have to watch it over and over and over again. It is a great movie!!!"
3,"Great concept, but could be better","I ordered several of these to install. Two went on my french doors, top and bottom for extra support. One is on an entrance door. They were very easy to install,screws provided were ok, not too much but not too little. You could install with longer screws for added support. I was able to adjust for uneven door flush as the trim stuck out more than the door. Latch still workable. The design flaw would be that there needs to be more of the pin coming out of the latch. There is a long enough flang, but if there were at least 1/2 inch or 1 inch coming out of latch, it would work better. I was able to shake the door enough to get the pin to move out of the latch. We figured out if we moved the pin latch higher than the insert latch, it would put enough twist on pin so it wouldn't move if shaken. All and all the latch is made with good quality, and it is mfg in the USA.."
1,"Poor design, not same a pictured","This should be a pretty simple purchase but the latch that I just received is not as pictured although it is the same model number. The latches are different and the bolt only makes one weak point of contact .. it does not pass all the way through as it should. Please see attached pics .. the latch I received is a poor design, it would cost more to return it so for $5 I'll find something to do with it.[IMG][...][IMG][...]"
2,Fender Accesories Guitar Tools,"El product arrived with damage, the wax pulled out of the container and we need to clean thes rest of the accesories"
3,Sent wrong flag,I ordered the black Mizzou tiger logo flag and received the gold Mizzou football helmet flag. It appears to be high quality - but since it's the wrong one I need to return it.First time I've ever had a problem like this with Amazon - very dissapointed since we are going to a game today and my wife really wanted the one we ordered.
5,"Great, Inexpensive set of knives.",We love these knives. They have a great feel - heavy and very sharp. It comes with a sharpener and you should use it often (the instructions say every time). You need to wash them by hand. One of the labels did fall off when we took it out the box but I just used some wood epoxy and it looks good as new - no problems since. My dad was here last week and used them when he was cooking dinner. He comments on the fact I had new knives and how great they were. When I told him how much they cost he was amazed at how affordable they were (we got a 39.99 special).
5,Anolon Knife Set,The knife set arrived in a timely manner and has been great tool set. The utility knife has a wonderful cutting edge and handles beautifuly along with the rest of the set.
3,"Good blades, but the rest has issues","Got the knives today. As expected from other reviews on Amazon, the metal labels on the wooden box are corroded, but not too much to return the item. The knives say they are made in China, though they also say the steel is German. Maybe they are assembled in China - the rubber on the handles must be from China. The handles feel good to touch, but are ""unpolished"" in places-- the rubber wears out there, i.e. loses small pieces when you rub the handle with your palm. Its soft, so no blisters can develop on your hands. These blemishes are actually minor, again, not sufficient to return the product. I guess the handles will wear out from ordinary wear and tear long before the blades do."
4,Decent set of knives,"These are not bad knives, hold their sharpness better then my previous set of Budget Sabatier knives I bought from Amazon but still are not as good as some high end German made knives that I own."
3,Nice Knives but knife knife block's labels are corroded,"I recently ordered this item and was a a little disappointed in the condition of the knife block(the metal labels were worn and tarnished with black.) I tried cleaning them with no luck. However, I loved the knives so I ordered a replacement thinking it was just a defective knife block but to my dismay I received one with the block even worse off(more corrosion and black). I sent the replacement back and kept the first one. I am bummed I had paid $100 for something that wasn't in good condition but I really love the knives so I guess I am keeping it."
1,Defective switches,"The dispenser switch of this electric kettle is often defective. I have one of this and every time I press the on/off switch to dispense water, the temperature control switch jumps to a lower temperature setting, and I have to reset it, which result in the kettle going into re-boil again. Now the on/off switch doesn't work altogether. My mother has one of these water kettle, and she has the same problem. I think there is manufacturing defect in the microcomputer control mechanism. Don't buy it."
4,Hot water at the touch of a button,"We really like this pot..no pumping by hand and it's easy to maintain. The filter at the bottom will plug when using ""hard water"" so if you notice the stream diminishing just pop it out (a magnet holds it in place)and soak it in vinegar..if worst comes to worst, use a needle to open the metal fabric again."
5,Teachable Book,i use this book as a reference for when i am going to teach a stamping class. it has everything you need for the beginner and is full of fun techniques for the advanced stamper to relearn and to re-do some of their own art. i recommend this book to every stamper especially beginners.
2,Nothing exciting,"Like James Dunn sytle, with careful exegsis on selected passages from epistles of Paul. However, discussing that kind of living issue, more real life observations and applications will surely enrich the content and make this book more enjoyable and useful."
2,Far from the best Piano Blues,"This album is far from the best that piano-oriented Blues has to offer. Mercy Dee Walton plays very similarly on every track, as does his harmonica player. The songs that are keepers are ""After The Fight"", ""Have You Ever Been Out In The Country"", ""One Room Country Shack"", which is the song the man is famous for, and ""Shady Lane"", which has some great lyrics. The rest of the songs are nothing special, and are even semi-irritating. Any album by Roosevelt Sykes would suit a piano Blues-hungry listener better."
1,buddhist quotes,"I didn't like the book at all and will return it. It's not what I expected, the book is heavy and the pictures are not so great. I have lived in Asia and this book doesn't include the best quotes about the buddhism."
3,just okay,"The ""inspirational wisdoms"" are most of the time very uninspirational........almost negative. I was not impressed. The photos are repeated throughout the book."
4,"Great book of daily ""offerings.""",I discovered this book at a counseling center and found it to be a must have. Both the thoughts and accompanying photographs are reflective and encouraging.
3,incongruous,"On June 26 there is a photo of a market with exotic (perhaps endangered?) animal skins hanging in the background. On September 11 there is a quote--""Should one not hate that self who, from a desire to combat sickness, hunger and thirst, kills birds, fish, animals and becomes an enemy of all living things?"" Seems to be a bit of incongruity here."
5,My second copy of this wonderful book.,My second copy of this wonderful book. I start every day with the quotation. The photography is superb as well.
3,light for a caver,"I have had this light for well over a year. The primary use is for caving. It fits well on my helmet and seems to have held up well structurally. The bright setting is good and the two LEDs are really handy. My primary point of dissatisfaction is with the rechargable battery. I have noticed the contacts are now dull grey and do not conduct well at all times. I have a friend who has the same light and he had the same problem.If I were in the market for a new light now I would definately choose the Sten Light (do a google search) over the Soliras for caving. It is brighter and gives more hours of light. The Sten has 4 power levels and both 3 & 4 outshine the the Soliras.If you are going to spend $200+ on a light, you might as well get the Sten for $300 or else get a cheaper light in the $50 range."
4,great watch !!!,"it's kind confusing to adjust the time and date at first, but overall it is a good simple watch."
1,scam product. didn't work. couldn't connect to it.,The ip was changed to something I wasn't told. so i had to trash it. I spend 3 times more for instruments to connect to this switch than i paid for the switch and at the end it didn't work. I had to through it in the storage.
2,Dont do business with!,I thought I was getting a brand new set! When it arrived the case was all bent up and cheap! the chips were all brand new though and so were the cards/dice/dealer button. But before they shipped it took a long time due to confusion on their part...do not do business with
1,No thanks!,"I attempted to buy chips from these guys. Unfortunately, after three weeks I still didn't have anything arriving in the mail, and it's impossible to get a hold of anyone at this company. After many e-mails and almsot another month I was able to at least get my money back, with no explanation of what had happened to my order. Ridiculous that these guys are even allowed to list on Amazon. Beware!"
2,hard to get into,"My students are having a really difficult time getting into this book. Perhaps as they get further along they will be more engaged; for right now, even the most advanced are merely tolerating it."
4,Pretty good.,"M.C. Higgins the Great is a pretty good story. I like its feeling and how it portrays Sarah's Mountain. I agree with another review that sometimes a beautiful or well-written scene is sometimes just followed up by regular, sometimes boring writing. I don't really get how it won such a high honor as the National Book Award, but I can understand why it won the Newbery. I like how the author showed M.C.'s thoughts between paragraphs, like ""Going to be my best day."" or ""We stay here and die."" It had some pretty heartfelt passages. I don't really know what to think of the ending. I don't think it was that good, but somehow it seemed pretty necessary because it showed then how M.C. stood up to his father and did what he had to do. The last two pages are pretty moving, too. I can understand why some people liked this book and why some people didn't. I'm kind of in the middle. Anyway, I'd recommend ""M.C. Higgins, the Great."""
1,I Still Remember How Boring This Book Was,I am twenty four years old and remember reading this book in the fifth grade. The only thing I remember about this book is how incredibly boring it was and something about a tall tricycle? It's actually become a synonym for boring among my family and circle of friends I remember loathing this book so much. Do not waste your time reading this.
3,Brittney's Review on M.C. Higgins,"I liked this book M.C. Higgins the great because I think that he is very caring, and he likes to imagine things. He is very curious on things and he loves his family. He worries about his home getting spoiled on. He wonders about what it would be like if his mom becomes a singer, and they can live in a better home, and his family wouldn't have to be poor. I liked this book ,and i think it was very interesting."
1,What is the plot?,"As I listened to this book on tape, I continually wondered when something would happen. Characters are introduced, but nothing happens to these characters. When I reached the end of the book, I was still wondering what the point of this book is. I am surprised it won the Newberry Medal. Perhaps it is fun for children."
2,"Over-rated. Not likely to ""turn"" your child onto reading","I recall choosing this book to write a book review on when I was a young teenager. I found it to be heavy-going. On nearly every level it failed to keep my interest. I don't remember the plot that well, except for the first few pages, which I read over and over trying to get a grip on the style (so to speak) but I do remember it seemed to jump around a lot, and not in a *good* way. I didn't ""connect"" with the characters at all, and thus I didn't care how the plot eventuated."
3,Get Serious M.C.,"What I think of this novel is that it was exciting but I was not JUMPING out of my seat to read my. At some point of the book were all right but I lost instead in the book after M.C. and the strange girl had the BIG conflict in the woods. Hamilton must have better books than M.C.Higgins,the Great. Than I will read than."
3,Shakeya's Review on M.C. Higgins,I liked the book M.C. Higgins the Great because Virginia Hamilton made the book interesting. M.C. is a very caring person and he is also friendly. The best part in the book is when M.C. tried to help his mother get a job by getting the Dude to record his mothers voice. M.C cares a lot about his family and he is very loving. I really enjoyed the book M.C. Higgins The Great it was a good book.
3,Why did this book win the Newbery?,"As I listened to this book on audio tape I wondered how any child could make it through reading it. The pace is slow, and I didn't find the characters very engaging. M.C. himself wasn't even very likeable. The plot--M.C.'s fear of the slag heap behind the house falling on them--is weak. I suppose there are redeeming qualities--M.C. learning to understand his father and M.C. learning tolerance and respect for the ""witchy"" people, but you have to slog through a lot of uninteresting pages in the meantime."
1,What an ironic title.,"M.C. Higgins the Great, as he is called, is not exactly my definition of great. In fact, there is nothing even remotely great about him. He is a boy who ties lettuce to his wrists and sits on top of a pole. Oh, how absolutely wonderful.It's truly amazing that this book got published at all, let alone won a Newbery. I can't recall ever reading a book that was worse than this. There is no plot, the characters are all pretty much the same, and just when you think that something might be about to happen, the book is over. Please, for the sake of your sanity, do not subject yourself to the torture that is this book. There are plenty of others that won't bore you to death."
1,?,"books that win the Newbery Medal sometimes don't deserve the award at all. MC Higgins the Great was one of them who deserved to not win anything at all. I had to force myself to scrape through 65 pages and considered reading the 100-page mark a great achievement. i fell asleep after reading to page 120. Awful. The book didn't paint a picture in my head at all, and I question the taste of people in ? year."
1,Poor choice for an award,"I must have missed something. Somebody must have thought this was a great book and gave it many awards, but it was a real struggle to finish this book. The events were totally unbeleivable and down right ridiculous. And it took 278 pages to cover just two days in the life of M.C.. I enjoy readng but I sure wouldn't ever reread this book or recommend this book."
3,M.C Higgins the Great,Virgina Hamilton I Didnt like the book to much because it didnt have any exciting points that i liked.So the next book you write please have some good points in the book.Otherwise than that the book was great.
1,NO!!,"I had to read a book and do a book report. I chose this book because in the beginning it kind of interests me but I didn't understand it. So I am here doing my report and the story jumps around. I can't get it!! I think I am going to get a bad grade because I didn't like it...only for some parts. But there is no story, no meaning and those are what I was suppose to mention in my report..this book didn't catch my interest. I have advice for students that want to do book reports. Don't choose this book!!!It's very difficult...."
2,BORING...............!!!!!!!!!!,"SO BORING!!!!!!! This book is so boring....it was an assignment in class and I could barely keep my eyes open during the time we waisted to read it.I mean this book was better for like 4th 0r 5th graders and it clearly didn't make much sence. i would not recomend this book to anyone under the age of like 11 or 12.Okay, listen the seeting of the story is like the mountains and you wanna know where the story ended up ? NOWHERE!!! the whole book was about a bunch of odd people in some little valley and some freakish boy that could see the future about some spoil heap falling on his house. which his room was in a cave ."
1,M.C higgins,I did not like this book. I think it was confusing.I didn't like how it kept going to flashbacks in the middle of the story. That is what confused me. It wasn't interesting or adventures. To say it in a simple way. It was boring and corney for young kids but for older people it probably might be interesting.
1,This book is soooooo boring!,"WORD OF WISDOM: If you dont like books about background, simple adventures, or that are boring, dont read this book! really, i recomend ya dont read it. I am not writing a review for a book thats soooooo boring."
2,Some data loss and power supply failure,"Worked pretty well except for one group of files that got corrupted. Now today the drive doesn't work at all. No power to it it seems. I'm guessing the power adapter quit as my last WD external drive had the same problem. However, that drive at least had an indicator light built into the power supply so I knew that was what happened. This cheap junk power suplly doesn't even have that so I have no way of knowing if power is actually getting to the drive and THAT'S dead. I would not recommend this."
2,Huge Transformer,"The thing looks cool in the picture, but it comes with a huge transformer that they don't show in the picture. I had thought it was powered by USB it cannot."
2,Disappointing,Drive became corrupt the second day I had it. Lost all of my data. Disappointing product.
5,Very impressed.... so far,"Though I never owned an external hard drive before this one, it works very well. It is pretty quiet (though not SILENT) transfers information much quicker than I expected, and is very conveniently sized. If I have troubles with it, I'll be sure to update."
5,Works so far,"So far this has been great, and has helped immensely to free up space on my computer. I did forget to reformat to that version that lets you transfer massive files over (I forget what it's called, but I'm sure other people here have mentioned it, and it's described in the brief manual as well); Once I reformatted though things have worked fine, and it's been a nice place to keep my hard drive in case something happens.I just hope it lasts."
2,"The Honeymoon is over, and it ended with a bang","Worked flawlessly for about two months. Today it's blinking on/off in a very fast infinitely repeating cycle. From Answer ID # 1314 on WD Tech Support, it means it either isn't getting enough power from the power strip/surge protector (ruled that out), has had a power supply failure, or a drive failure. And to make this sweeter, I didn't make the DVD backups of my data like I should; I grew too trusting of my WD. Well, I've been cured of that. The honeymoon is over, and it ended with a bang. Not literally, but it might as well have been."
2,Don't bother,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I took a chance and bought one at Staples. It crashed everything... In two days! Misery is all I can say I'm suffering from!J"
2,Nor user friendly.,Purchased this 3 yrs. ago. It comes with no instructions. Backed up my computer but when computer crashed was unable to retrieve info. My son also tried with no success. Not a fan!
5,Good to have,You'll be surprised at the amount of metal filings that this magnet traps. It can't be good to leave that stuff in your oil pan.
5,Excellent Product,The pans were all they are advertised to be. They come out clean when used and the size is easy to use and store. AAA+
4,nice little pan but smaller than expected,"Smaller than I was looking for. This pan is good quality, but it is very little. Make sure you read the dimentions before purchasing it."
4,Great pan but need several,"Love Bakers Secret.Super quality. Ordered 3 so one recipe could be used by filling all 3 at once. Unfortunately only one arrived and no more were available, even at a later date, Pan is great, supplier is not."
4,cute little pan,"I have not been able to use this yet, but it looks sturdy and was delivered in good condition"
5,Great Look Into The Greatest Film Project of All Time,"The Making of the Movie Trilogy is a great glimpse of just how much though, time, work, and energy went into this wonderful movie trilogy. I own it and love it. The only thing I warn buyers of is that it does not cover much of how ""The Return of the King"", the third and final ""Lord of the Rings"" film, was made because the book came out before the third film. Therefore, they didn't want to spoil too much for the final film. I'm sure there will probably be more in-depth books just like this one after all the films are released. Make your decision. I bought it because I couldn't wait!"
2,High Quality But Achingly Incomplete,"With a title like 'The Making of the Movie *Trilogy*', this book is not nearly as comprehensive as it should be. While there are great photos and interesting background information, the book mostly covers The Fellowship of the Ring and some of The Two Towers.I was expecting much more - actors' biographies, the screenwriters' methods and decisions in writing the screenplay, a timeline of the making of the trilogy, etc. Also I hoped that it would be more celebratory of the achievements of this landmark film series. This was impossible since the book was published prior to the release of the Two Towers. So that's my fault for not looking at the publication date.In a nutshell, the book is a premature summary that fails to pay tribute to the entire trilogy. It makes a mediocre collector's item that I could have done without. One star for information and another for quality photos."
3,The Making of the Movie Trilogy,"The Lord of the Rings: The Making of the Movie Trilogy is like a wonderfully large colorful journal of what it was like working on the set of this magnificent trilogy for those many, many months. With a foreword by Ian McKellen, a.k.a. Gandalf, author Brian Sibley does an excellent job of keeping the reader locked in with the many different happenings that took place during the shooting of the trilogy. With some wonderful color photos of cast and sets, as well as illustrations and drawings, there is a never-ending supply of detail and information about the trilogy, like the fact that 48,000 pieces of armor were designed and made. It is a fantastic book that belongs on the shelf of any fan's, and makes a great Christmas present for anyone who is interested in Lord of the Rings.Originally published on December 9th, 2002.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
3,The MAKING is Good...,"As fans eagerly await the rest of the Tolkien Trilogy to be delivered to theaters, the recently released Expanded DVD just wasn't enough. Brian Sibley's book takes us in where the average movie-goer only wished they could tread. Wonderfully written with hundreds of photos...the only thing missing from this tome is the often ""real treats"" found in most making of platforms: detailed production illustrations.For a better ""making of"" experience, check out the very beautiful STAR WARS: MYTHMAKING The Making of Episode II."
5,Totally pleasing and worth buying!!!!,"Ever since these films came out, ive been totally hooked. So ive gone on an escapade to buy as many of the books related to the films as possible. Naturally this book was one that a sought after highly.It is filled with so much detail that one almost understands exactly what the entire cast and crew went through in those years.I would totally recommend it for any LofR fan.If a HAD to make one complaint, it would be that some of the photos are maybe a bit small but this is trivial.Go out, buy and it & ENJOY!!!!!"
2,Not great,"Too few pictures from the movie, and the ones there are are mostly too small. Text is okay, but much more (and much more interesting) information is available on the expanded edition DVDs."
4,Interesting and beautiful book,"That's a very picturesque book and an interesting narrative. It's more about making the movie and the WETA involvment in it than, say, about the actors of the movie, as I was hoping. But it's still very interesting, uncovers some film production facts and includes some interviews. But if you're interested in the actors' interaction with each other and the like, better pick up Sean Austin's book (There and back again, an actor's tale)."
1,Extremism?,"This will be a very short review. It appears to me as if the author would probably label anyone who believes the Bible, old and new testaments, as an extremist. Perhaps this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black."
5,Local talk show host opened my ears to Beres Hammond,"The fanastic talented talk show host Reggie Bryant of Phila., has turned me on to some of the greatest musicians to every step up to a mike. Thank you Reggie, you are my idol."
5,Need to locate a cable? You need this,"Small, simple and 100% accurate. If you need to locate a cable as we do daily, this is the only easy way."
1,NOT SO HAPPY,"I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE AND ONE GOES THROUGH BATTERIES PRETTY FAST. I MEAN THE BATTER DIES IN JUST A DAY OR TWO. BEING 12 VOLT BATTERIES THAT GETS SPENDY. THE SPEAKER COMES OFF WAY TO EASY. I OFTEN REACH INTO MY POCKET AND FIND THE SPEAKER HAS COME HALF WAY OFF. NOW THIS UNIT SAVES TIME, BUT I HAD ANOTHER BRAND THAT TOOK AAA BATTERIES, WHICH ARE CHEAPER TO BUY, GIVE ME AS GOOD A SERVICE, AND THE SPEAKER DIDN'T WANT TO COME OFF ALL THE TIME."
3,Some important information...,"People reading this book should know that Coren's theorys are not completely accepted. Other good scientists believe that left-handedness could be gentic. Other scientists believe other things and each have done tests to back up their beliefs. Coren has proved his theory, but others have proved otherwise. While it is an interesting book, if one is interested in such things, it was written over 7 years ago, and some of the information is no doubt no outdated. Try it, but don't take the information as truth without considering other possibilities."
1,How 90% (Right hands) See Lefties,"I bought this book because my daughter was born a Lefty, so I wanted to see how I need to adjust to help her live in an almost all right handed world. This book was so depressing and shows how the researchers (right handed) see the greatness of the lefties. I also bought ""Loving Lefties: How to Raise Your Left-Handed Child in a Right-Handed World"" at the same time. I would not recommend this book and absolutely loved ""Loving Lefties: How to Raise Your Left-Handed Child in a Right-Handed World."" It is to bad this author is so negative. One can tell the author is biased and made the research fit his agenda. I wouldn't use this book as lining in a bird cage."
1,Disappointing,"This book is an interesting combination of fairly good writing and fairly poor science. The information on which the author draws is taken out of its context, so while his conclusions have an internal logic, that logic is far-fetched and has almost no bearing on the rest of the world. But the author's writing is good enough to keep this from being self-evident. I found the book an easy but worthless read."
1,Sad Sorry Snoozer,This book is not what I thought I bought. I was expecting information useful to left handers. Instead I found out why society belives left-handers are evil and research on how left handers are formed. I enjoyed reading the encylopedia more than this book.
2,"classy watch but not precise, runs too fast","Beautiful watch but runs too fast - makes additional 3 minutes per week, what is close to 15 minutes per month! This disqualifies the watch that costs over $300. Unfortunately, the watch will go back."
3,Side-effects?,"I'm not sure if this book covered the extreme side-effects attributed to Sam-E...it is an semi-informative book on alternatives, but do your research elsewhere before you take Sam-E."
2,Not adequately researched!,"This book is overly exuberant. Just like many books in this genre, one is left with the message that SAMe is the panacea the world has been waiting for. However this book fails to mention some basic information about SAMe that is CRITCAL (i.e.- SAMe has been known to cause electrolyte disturbances (especially involving calcium and potassium), can lead to elevated blood pressure as well as cause anxiety/panic attacks in SOME individuals). Do not take without the guidance of a qualified NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIAN!"
3,Appearance,The hot rod is awesome looking. Overall its an incredible fun toy for anyone who places with it. The only problem is the rear wing pops off completely making it somewhat annoying.
1,Rip Off Didn't receive My Order,They will rip you off don't buy from them ! I Order TWO Dildos from these place then I only received One dido These Also I had to email them two time just to get them send the order In the mail box STAY Away from these place Don'torder anything from these place all I can say RIP OFF RIP OFF RIP OFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Thank you!!,"Power Cord for NoteBook, Non-Polarized 6 ftGood product for the price, great shipping service."
3,Interesting,"There is only one word to describe this book...interesting. The author's tyle is very unique. He desplays the main character, a black cat named Lord Gort, differently than most writters of children's books would have. Unlike most animal fiction novels, you cannot read every exact thought running through the cat's mind and you tend to connect more to the human characters in the book. It is definately a weird book. It's written like a child's book: easy to read, short words, ect., but there is sex and violence in it. Also, the cat abandons her young, again unlike most children's books. This is really the type of book you'd have to read to understand. It's incredably unique. I personally think the author tried too hard to mix in the violence of the war, the passion of two lovers, the pain of a lost loved one and the nature of the feline species. I incourage you to read the book before giving it to a daughter or grandson or whatever."
4,A Second World War Book with a Difference,"Lord Gort is a cat. Separated from her person, she sets out to find him and in the process meets a number of different people on different situations. Against this backdrop we have a set of short stories, all connected by the cat, and all revealing so much about war time Britain. Westall has researched the events well and describes actual war time events, such as the bombing of Coventry, to create a novel that transports the reader into a bygone era. This is a very good piece of writing, rich in historical detail."
5,Great book about WWII for cat lovers,"This is an excellent novel! It sparked my interest in World War II at a young age.It tells the story of a lost cat traveling through England during the Blitz. Much like Jack London's White Fang, Westall's cat character behaves like an actual cat, and not like a humanized version of one.As a child, she gave me a clear window into the strange world of history. It was hard for me to relate to foreign wars before my time, but I loved cats. Seeing the war through the eyes of a cat helped me to really understand it for the first time.Robert Westall has a very straightforward writing style. He stays somewhat detached from his characters, allowing the reader to make their own connections and judgments. I found this approach very appropriate for the story - it keeps things feeling realistic instead of seeming like a Disney TV special about a lost cat.If you like this one, check out Robert Westall's other books about cats or World War II!"
5,Wonderful,"My review of this wonderful book that I have read is that as you read along about the book it makes you feel as though you are on the journey with her. Reading this book has been a excellant, exciting, interesting moments for me. Thank You!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Worth Reading,"It was slow, boring, dragged out. I had to force myself to read this book. It wasn't interesting which was amazing since the subject, WW2, is extremely interesting. This book was terrible and I would never recommend it."
1,Did not receive this item,This book never arrived. After some time I contacted the seller who told me they mailed the book...I never received a confirmation or tracking number. They did process a refund however. I have my doubts that the book ever was sent.
3,false claim of these ideas for operation research?,"Most of the ideas that I read in this book are not from""operations research""? Putting them in this book as thatseems to be misrepresentation of the mathematics involved.Queueing theory and Monti Carlo theoryare both from different areas of mathematics and physics.For me this is puzzling: Jagit Singh's other book on modern cosmologywhile being older is very much better than this book.I really need to learn more to understandthe claims in this book for operations research."
3,diminishing returns,"Outremer Book One delivered skillfully blended action, moral quandry, and usolved mystery to hook me. Outremer Books Two & Three delivered. The pace was rapid, with developing good guys, bad guys and perilous journiesOutremer Book Four has put all this great structure on the back burner to investigate overly complex love polygons (triangle just doesn't cut it). Even the few action scenes (what little is there is very good), are overshadowed by heavy-handed emotional and sexual ambiguities, and resulting (continuing?) multi-party dispair.It will be very difficult to read Outremer Book Five if I can't finish wading through the last 20% of Book Four.This is still a good choice if you are into Harlequin romances."
3,I thought the book was bigger,"I bought this book for my daughter. When I ordered it, i guess I was under the assumption it would be bigger. Its a tiny little book with only a few pages. My mistake I guess for assuming."
5,One of our favorites..,"I bought this book as a gift since my son loves it so much. He brings it up to us knowing he'll get kisses when we read it. It teaches children the parts of the body, and gives an excuse to parents to cuddle and kiss their ""babies"". My son is 18 months old, and still loves this book. He giggles as soon as we start to read it."
4,Great little book,"I got this book at the library and our 20 mo. old daughter loved it so much I had to buy it for her. She wants it read to her over and over.The illustrations are beautiful and it helps her to learn body parts, too.A great book for toddlers!"
4,Great book for toddlers,"With simple text and beautifully illustrated pages, Daddy Kisses is a great book for toddlers. It, along with Daddy Cuddles, another book in the series, makes a wonderful gift for any father."
4,a whole lot of info!,i bought this book cause i wanted info on two study abroad programs... i got that and a whole lot more! all i can say is wow. never knew there were so many things for teens to do!
2,not as good as the real gray duct tape,"this tape does not stick nearly as well as the gray duct tape that i'm used to, even if the gray duct tape might have left residue behind."
2,Not too crazy about the stick.,"I purchased this tape just to fix some holes on my convertable top chrysler. I should of gotten the ""Duct tape"" brand. Because It holds alot better."
4,Non-traditional ordering of chapters,"I just completed a junior-level course which made use of this text. Although the topics are arranged differently than in similar textbooks, I found the explainations of EM concepts quite good. The main strength is getting right to Maxwell's equations in chapter two (--after all, that's what EM is all about, right?). Maxwell's equations are explained well and at an introductory level so that the reader is not overwhelmed. The main weakness is the very underdeveloped first chapter, ""Complex Vectors"" which is too brief and oversimplified for the subject matter at hand. The book also presents very informative and even entertaining asides on applications, such as ""anti-glare headlights"" (polarization), ""tails of comets"" (radiation pressure) and ""microwave ovens"" (penetration depth). Overall, a very good first EM book."
1,"pseudoscientific gibberish, and ridiculous claims without any factual basis","For context, I have an education in science (MS physics) and work as an engineer in the defense industry. I have an open mind on the UFO question and appreciate good solid work on the subject. For example, I was impressed with (and entertained by) James Fox's ""Out of the Blue"". But this is film is little more than wild speculation by a man who quite obviously has no knowledge of science or scientific methodology but seems intent and appearing as if he does. Almost painful to watch."
1,How NOT to spend 3 hours of your time!,"Most of this video (95%) is the presenter (Sereda) giving a high school level lecture on basic physics. Once in awhile, he will present a NASA video of what appears to be bright objects flying in space. This is easily explained by ice particles or debris floating in space, many of which are out of focus. There is no intelligence behind the motion of these flying partices. In the last hour, Sereda rambles on and on with his strange theories about his ""galaxy clock"" and how it relates to galaxies, black holes, faster than light travel, and then about ancient tribes in Asia and Africa and Egyptian mythology. Don't waste your time or money on this boring video."
1,Evidence ?????,"Wish I could have rated this DVD as ""0 stars""!Don't waste your time or money... unless you believe in amphibian-aliens (flying fish?!?!?) traveling to earth in waterfilled UFOs to save us humans. (That's a major conclusion of this inane presentation.)As to the so-called footage... if genuine (and I doubt it is), I believe it is most likely doctored.Should have known it would be nuts when Dan Ackeroyd introduced it, and later with the wierd, spacey backgound music!"
1,Idiotic,"This is absolutely, positively, impressively pathetic. David Sereda is not an expert on anything, let alone physics or space science. It's dust, people. Dust and ice. The shuttle is a very dirty object once it gets into space. Note that EVERY item he points to (save one) moves in a straight line at a constant velocity. I would be much more impressed if any of these things moved in changing trajectories. The most ludicrous is the ""swarm"" around the ""tether."""
4,One of Sereda's First Films,"This video is a little hard to follow because David Sereda has a very quiet speaking voice.The information he presents, though, is staggering! Do you remember the failed ""Tethered"" satellite project?David shows you what really happened, why it happened and uses NASA Space Shuttle video to prove it.Then, he goes on to reveal the uncanny relationship between what was seen in space to what archaeologists found in China fifty or so years ago. It's all fascinating and this is the film that made me a fan of David Sereda."
3,Interesting and questionable?,"A great deal of time and effort went into 'Evidence - The Case for NASA UFO's, however, the DVD reminded me of why I couldn't sit still for over 2 hours in a classroom. Although the information was fascinating, it was pretty dry at times, especially when I was looking for definitive visual proof of UFO's.Some great theories and video captures, but proof was lacking even though I saw with my own two eyes objects hurtling through the air. Now, if what these objects were could have been discussed by opponents with their opinions - THAT would have been the ticket - not just a one way argument. The DVD was worth it just to get this possibility of little green men off of my mind, even though I myself have witnessed a UFO, and the theory of the speed required to space travel was mind boggling in itself, but even though I am a fan I can't get past Dan Aykroyd joshing us as a Conehead in Saturday Night Live."
3,Nothing new,"There really aren't any earth shattering ideas. Most are common sense or you can find them elsewhere. Also, tips seem to be repeated and right next to each other. There will be two ways to clean glass and they're only slightly different. It'd be nice to have it consolidated and an index"
3,doesn't live up to the hype,"I was hoping for so much more. There are a few good tips in here, but not enough. I was disappointed."
3,Ho-hum,"I wasn't too impressed with the tips in this book as many of them are old and sometimes I feel is just too much trouble to do. But I like the way the book is organized and there were web resources worth checking out. I think this would be good for someone just starting out on their own as it gives advice on spending and debt. It would be a nice book to have around the house but I don't think that I'm apt to write down the ingredients for an all-natural cleaner so I can remember to pick it up at the grocery store. There were also recommendations on certain cleaners like laundry additives but other than Borax, I couldn't find them in regular grocery stores. It's a plus though that there were many earth-friendly tips."
3,Reconsider Hunt's Tip,I tried the Oven-Fried Bacon tip on page 100. The bacon splattered all over my oven and smoked up the whole house. The time I saved cooking it all at once will be doubled by the oven clean-up.
2,butterfly basket,"unfortunaly I received a wrong item, different material and design, I ask to get my money back, so they sent it."
5,great for the whole family,"We watched this with out teenage kids, and it was entertaining and funny for both the kids and adults. Our 17 year old son loves his sound effects and impersonations. Very good DVD."
4,oh my side hurts!,From laughing so much! He is absolutely hilarious! I got this as a gift for my hubby and he loved it! although the shipping took longer than expected and it didn't make it here before christmas...but he still loved the show!
4,Gabriel,I love this guy! He's incredibly funny and is excellent at poking fun at himself as well as others.
5,The Best Comedian Ever!,"All that I can say is that Gabriel Iglesias is my favorite comedian, and this DVD had me laughing so hard that I couldn't breathe. Buy it... just buy it..."
5,"funny, funny man...","I have seen this man twice in person, and will see him again next time he is in town. Fluffy is so funny...Everyone that has seen this DVD that I know thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it if you want to entertain visitors to your home, or just want to laugh out loud!!!"
5,Hilarious!!!,"This comedy was hilarious! I like all different types of stand up comedy, from ""dirty"" Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphey, Andrew Dice Clay,etc. to good clean humor just like this one.Worth the money, very funny, fun for the whole family!ENJOY!"
1,Childish Jokes ....Silly Sound Effects....BORING!,"I've seen this guy before on t.v. he was pretty funny but not now, its just face fat jiggling physical humor that just doesnt work anymore, its the same stale act he has always had with even more silly stale sound effects. Not funny at all to me......"
2,Sorry Fluffy is not that funny,He has good sound effects and a few good moments that made me laugh but overall I just would not recommend.
1,not very funny...,I'm almost surprised by all the five star reviews here. But I guess it's just a matter of different senses of humor. Iglesias' jokes were tasteless and unfunny. They didn't appeal to me at all. The best reaction I had to this was a chuckle :\.
5,Great Comedian,I laughed so hard while watching this comedian my sides hurt the next day. I bought family members this DVD for Christmas and they enjoyed it as much as I did. I recommend this DVD or video 100%!!!!!
5,He's not fat he's fluffy!,"I've seen Gabriel's stand up comedy on comedy central, so I had to buy this DVD. He keeps you laughing throughout the whole hour or so that it's on. He's great with voices and sound effects! He is one of my favorite comedians. I definately reccomend this DVD. Plus, I bought it and it shipped only a few days after i had purchased it. :)"
5,Love it! very funny,I love Gabriel Iglesias - he is always very entertaining and clever. I would get anything of his and he did not disappoint this time.
4,Too Funny,This was a great way to decompress after a rough day on the job. Laughed myself to tears while listening and I love all of Gabriel's impersonations.
3,"Comedy content great, video quality subpar","Really enjoyed the comedy routine. I have seen it before on Comedy Central with commercials, however the video quality was much better. I would DVR it on CC and skip commercials before I would pay for it."
2,not that funny,just not that funny. Couldn't get into him either you get into a comic or you don't no other explanation needed.
3,a nice disc,"Let me start by saying I love Gabriel Iglesias, I've seen him onstage and he is funny; however, this special was not filmed in HD and this disc comes across as just a transfer. The jokes are HD, but the picture is barely there. I bought it to upgrade my collection. I still love this disc."
5,hot & fluffy,"I think he's very funny, he did do some of the same stuff from an earlier special, but it was still very funny. The skit about the disney ride was hiliarious! You will laugh alot with this dvd!"
4,Fluffy's funny,"I first saw him on Comedy Central. I thought this special was so funny that I watched it again on Amazon with my hubby, who also liked it."
4,"Fun toy, but too expensive for what you get!","My son readily accepted this set after I sold his large Thomas the train set due to too many recallsfor lead. He has a lot of fun on it, I was just a little bummed out that they don't tell you ahead oftime that the gray road pieces are cardboard puzzle pieces and not wood. I know this product isfrom Europe but it really should be cheaper for what you get."
2,Meh..,"I really did not enjoy this book. It was wrote more like a study guide to Von Richthofen's autobiography then a solid end to end story that drew me into the history of the Red Baron himself. Kinda reminded me how I used to write papers in college with a few linking paragraphs then a huge quote from the source. Personally, I believe I got more out of the Wikipedia page then this book."
5,The Grandfather of air combat.,"This book is great! An insight into the thoughts of the grandfather of air combat tactics. Manfred's descripton of Boelke and the early air tactics of fighter aircraft is well worth the read. Humorous, and serious, this is also a book for anyone that wants to excel in the business world, Manfred delivers sage advice regarding life and skills needed to become the best."
4,Good to excellent,"An autobiography on the Red Baron up until he was killed in action, First chapter in the book dispells any myths about ""he only shot down lesser performing aircraft - reality only 36 kills out of 80"" etc, Manfred gives details of his and his family background his initial military career as a calvary officer and the opening stages of the war which then follows onto his aviation career until he was killed."
2,"""The Red Baron"" Paperback edited by Hans-Peter Oswald is poor quality","This paperback edition looks like it was scanned from another document and printed without editing. It does not include some of the features that are advertised on Amazon as part of the hardcover edition. And, it is 3 times the price of a very well done paperback of just Righthofen's autobiography titled ""The Red Fighter Pilot""(which I also ordered from Amazon). That is the version that I would recommend instead of this one."
5,APBA : Board Baseball's Field of Dreams,"If you're a baseball fan, at least 12 years old, and long for theexcitment of the game even during the winter, here's youor answer.APBA MLB Baseball has all the players, fun, strategy and realism that you could want. Actual Major League players bat, pitch, run & field like their real life counterparts.The player cards (esp. the batters) reperesnt ""at a glance recognition"" once you've played several games and know what ther numbers stand for. The excitement of looking at a home run hitting slugger is incredible!If you're looking for the excitement of Major League Baseball in a board game, look no furhter. This is it!Steve Kaplan"
5,APBA nut,I have played this game since 1978 and have had nothing but pleasure each year. It is very addictive and has taught me alot about the game of baseball.
3,Tubby the Tuba,My 2 year old really likes it. There's nothing like old-time cartoon movies; the innocence and the life lessons. I have heard better renditions and recordings of the music - but it's very nice. I wish the tuba depicted were bigger and more tuba-like. So does my kid - Tubby doesn't look very tuba to him. Also wish there were more tuba solos.
4,Tiffany Lamp,I like the look of the lamp. The suggested wattage light bulbs make the globe too warm. I'm concerned that it is a safety hazzard.
2,looks are deceiving,The lamp looks great. My only complaint is that the base and other parts are made out of plaster that can chip or break.
3,"Solid Product, Poor Backup Software","As for the hard drive itself, I'm quite impressed. It is very fast and behaves just like another hard drive.The difference between the Premium Edition and the Essential Edition is about $50 for which you get the WD Backup software. The Backup software needs some significant improvements to compare to other products like Acronis True Image, which just so happens to cost $50. While WDBackup provides scheduled backups, encrypted backups, incremental backups, and advanced backups (select exactly which files/folders to backup), the following deficiencies are not acceptable:1. Cannot view or edit an existing scheduled backup. You have to delete it and create a new one.2. Cannot backup networked drives.If I had to do it again, I would have bought the Essential Edition and purchased a much better backup software package."
4,Works great! Looks Great!,"While this drive ends up formatted at less than 320GB that's how hard drives work. But it's plenty big and at a great price.I plugged this baby into my intel Imac and it popped right up. It was formated FAT but a quick trip to disk utilities and it was reformated to Mac journaled. It's very silent, although I did give it only 4 stars becuase there is a bit more vibration from the drive than I expected.All in all a great product though."
1,WDG1C2500N went belly up after one year and 45 days,"Purchased a My Book Premium 250GB External Hard drive on 1/26/2007. Installation was normal. I backed up both a desktop and laptop every week. On 3/20/2007 the external Hard Drive began to click internally for the first time. I tried to do a backup but my computer did not recognize the My Book. Evidently it went belly up just beyond the one year limited warranty. I see that Western Digital is no longer selling the 250GB, 320GB, or 500GB on their Internet site. I have had no reply from Tech Support. Do I smell something rotten in Denmark?"
1,Did not work for iMac G5,"I purchased this unit for my iMac G5 over a year ago. It had a good price, and good amount of storage space so I thought this would be a good solution for my backups. Ever since I got it I've only been able to back up my data about 3 times. It seems to work fine at first, but then it freezes, crashes my computer (makes it restart) and then the drive locks out of my computer and it's not recognized anymore. I try unplugging, plugging it back, nothing. I wait a few months and it works again, only to end up the same way. Every now and then it will work fine but it's like a game of chance with this thing. I wouldn't recommend this unit at all."
1,Died after 10 months,Died after 10 monthsUsed on a Vista OS.Also had to often unplug and replug it in to get my computer to see it.All to often it just wasn't there.That is you couldn't find it in windows Explorer.So person isn't going to send it back to the manufacterer with your data on it.Bought another from another manufacturer hoping to have better luck.
1,bad shipping experience,I ordered this product and ended up having them recalling it because the shipping address was wrong and they were unable to change it.
3,Not too impressed,"I am no computer person, and don't intend to underate this product at all.I purchased this item a week ago and right now, the machine is doing the backup through WD's own backup program. I know some of 'hightech'person here suggested not to use it, but I just don't have time to figure out such a complecated process to avoid this software. Quite modern design which remins me of all apple-like product grabs my attention, but that's it. The noise it produces is very annoying. Most of all, it takes too much time to read. I was very debating between Maxtors Turbo III and this, finally decided not to sweat on the casche speed. Maybe I was wrong.No matter how I am not fully satisfied with this product, I have to stick with this because I got several video projects to go."
3,"A good ""read"" on JFK...just add a grain of salt","While I modestly recommend this book by Gretchen Rubin on JFK, as it is swank, 'sexy', and stylish, it does have an over-reliance on some talking-heads and dubious figures (i.e. Gerald Posner). In fact, her whole take on the assassination is dead WRONG---there WAS a conspiracy that took the life of President Kennedy. Still, an interesting ""read"" and certainly worth a look.Vince PalamaraSecret Service expert (History Channel, author of 2 books, in over 32 other author's books, etc.)"
2,100 pages would have been enough!,"This book takes 100 pages worth of material and expands it to 400 pages through reorganization, and even worse, repetition."
2,Rambling but interesting...,"Not much help for a casual student of wine looking to begin a cellar, but still an interesting read. He tends to focus very much on Australian wines (since he is from that land) and speaks mostly of wines that none of us can get, much less afford."
4,The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker Vol 2,"This album was recorded at the same April 1959 session that produced Hooker's more famous LP THE COUNTRY BLUES OF JOHN LEE HOOKER. For some reason it was unreleased until 1964 (UK only) and didn't see the light of day in the US until the early 90's. Which is odd because it is identical in style, sound and theme to the COUNTRY BLUES LP, featuring the same acoustic back porch feel.On the whole, a slightly lesser album than its more famous companion volume, but still a good one. If you like Hooker and/or acoustic blues, buy it."
5,Dividends collected,"The book contains so much information and strategic thoughts that is unfound in similar literatures.While reading the book, I was guided by the Authors to traverse the frontiers of Marketing, Management and Communication and yet the concepts and case studies of many world renowned companies are seamlessly fused together to answer one question: How to reap divideds in Asia's digital business environment?Other assets in the books are that the chapters are well organised so each one can be independently written to cater forindividual interests; also the charts show works of valuable and serious research, analysis and presentation.I felt I have collected handsome dividends already at the finish of the third chapter,"
4,TRANSFORMATION:YOULL SEE IT WHEN YOU BELIEVE IT/DR. WAYNE DYER,well this is the 4th or 5th time reviewing this item on christian humanitarism just a pleasure to review the ideas
5,NOT TO BE MISSED,"ONE OF DYERS EARLY ONES AND ONE OF THE BEST. IF YOU WANTTO GET SOME IDEA OF WHAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE, DON'T MISSREADING THIS ONE. PRESENTLY, ONLY USED AVAILABLE."
5,John Lee Hooker's slow country Blues,"That's My Story/ John Lee Hooker sings the blues: John Lee wrote all the songs he performs here and ""I need some money"" is the oft remade classic. Every cut here is slow, steady and brilliant. This is another John Lee Hooker classic."
2,Large...?,I thought that my 55lb dog would look too cute in this duckie robe. I was dissappointed when I opened the package and noticed that this would only fit a medium or smaller. I'm keeping anyways for future pets.
2,did you note the publishing date??,"Answer: 2002. That should be a ""caution"" for buying this book.Outdated tech. references: no mention of Trelix nor even Windows XP. A mention of Windows 2000 if that means allot to you.Trelix (a free service/perk of most ADSL ISPs or web hosting services) makes web design easy with no need for this book nor HTML knowledge. I bought it as Trelix did not answer a few minor questions & I thought I was an ""Idiot"" & needed some ""hand-holding"" by this Author. I'll give this book away to someone who actually wants to learn HTML. I was able to finally add a ""counter"" to my Verizon hosted site as this book did give me enough to appreciate the nuances of the free counter site upload advice. Another: ""dust collector book on the self""."
5,Excellent,"This book requires absolutely no ""computer education"" to understand. Paul McFeries has done a thourough and complete job of making this book completely comprehensible. It includes references to McFedries's website with color charts, java scripts, and more! Plus a bonus disc full of software, examples, and all sorts of stuff that he talks about in the book. You cannot go wrong with THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO CREATING A WEBPAGE."
2,Try another book.........,"This book had pretty good ratings. I don't like the layout and I'm not thrilled with the explanations. It's weak! Maybe if I already knew about creating web pages, this book might be helpful. Try another one!"
5,Confidence inspiring book,"This book is definitely a good one. When I first got it, I had a web page due in 2 days, and no clue of how to do it. 24 hours later, I was an expert. It has been so helpful to me in my quest to get a decent grade. I would reccomend reading enough chapters to understand the basics, and then skipping to the pages you need. As long as you have a clear idea of what you want, that is a perfect approach. If not, I would reccomend reading this book to get an idea of what you want, and then skipping back to the bits you need. (HTML isn't that easy to remember all at once!)"
3,Don't Be An Idiot,"I've used several Idiot's Guides and Dummy books in the pasy with a high level of satisfaction. This one doesn't measure up to the standards the others have set.The book is overly simplistic, and everything taught can be found easily on the web for free. Don't waste your money on this one.David M Farrands"
5,Great book to learn from!,"This is a very good book. Not much you can say. Comes with all the examples, some software, references, and good graphics. Easy reading and a funny guy to read too. I even created a web page using this book..."
2,Schutt Travel Tee,This tee works well in that it supports a baseball however if you hit the rubber holder with a bat the tee has a tendancy to fall apart. You must be a skilled hitter to consistantly hit the ball and not the tee. I would not recommend this tee for younger players. It is not the strongest tee on the market most of it is plastic and light metal. If I was to purchase another tee it would not be this one.
5,classic photos and bio's!!!,"reeves, grimek, schwarzenegger, sandow, klein, mentzer etc. with photos and info on their acomplishments!"
2,Embarrassing...,"Paper characters (including an unlikeable heroine), stock story, with bits of aburdities thrown in to compensate for poor writing and a plot with no momentum. In describing this book to a friend I said, ""Well, it's about a girl who has an affair with a much older man, and there's a sex scene involving a banana, and a talking cat who believes that he and the main character were lovers in their prior lives as fishmongers. Or something like that."" Couldn't bear to finish, but my fellow bookclubbers tell me the ending was a terrible disappointment."
2,Not deep at all,"While there were some touching moments, for the most part this book was weak. I disliked how long it took the protagonist to find out ""what was wrong with her"". How about some introspection? It was very obvious. Also the voice of Eliot's cat throughout was highly annoying and distracting."
2,Elliot's Banana,The cat was totally wierd! It was okay for a quick read but if you are looking for something deep this isn't it. I think that the author tried her best to make it something it wasn't but come on we have all the read books where someone has lost a loved one and it takes them less time to get their life back in less than 200 pages.
5,The way to go.,"I didn't want the 'ol 2 bulb special. I've seen them fail too many times. This light is bright, easy to setup and it works."
2,Broke 2 day of use.,The glass burst on the second day of use. We got a heavy rain and even though this light was under an awning the glass shattered. Terrible.
4,Not Guster,"I checked these guys out cause someone said they sounded like Guster. First of all, Guster is completely original and no one sounds like them. Secondly, they don't even come close. They sound more like Vertical Horizon."
1,this is horrible music,"I had to write a review in case anyone is looking at this alblum and actually has some taste in music. All these little heart throbbers dont even appreciate music, just look at how most of the reviews simply compare them to other bands. Music is supposed to be original not 'like this this and this'. More importantly their music has no substance what so ever. Its whiny and annoying. If you just like 'emotional' music then fine whatever waste your money on this CD but for anyone who knows what the word music means...keep looking"
5,The next big thing!,"Granian's follow-up CD displays some of their best work yet. This is one of the few discs I can play over and over, from start to finish (no fillers) and never get sick of. It's filled with original, catchy melodies that you won't forget. If you haven't heard this band yet, think of a cross between early Vertical Horizon, Guster and a little DMB thrown in, only better! It's just a matter of time before these guys start to get the recognition they deserve..so catch them now while you can still see them in small venues. And pick up their discs, they are awesome!"
3,1 out of 3 isn't bad?,"Fast Food Nation is something I don't think I want to watch. It looked a little too boring and depressing. Idiocracy was what I was looking for in the first place, and it was OK. My wife liked Young at Heart more than I did. It's a story about how a younger guy organizes a music show using only senior citizens. A couple of them die along the way, but the show goes on and is a success. It was OK, but not great."
1,Sweet Christ,"I don't know where to start the review honestly. Except I'll try to put you in the mood.Picture a land where there's 2D flapping birds trying to attack people. Picture clothes hangers being used as a defense against them.Sounds awesome, right? Now picture the birds not even coming into play for about 45 minutes. I could understand this if there was some kind of major plot to get to, but dear God.The bad acting is hilarious at first, but then you get used to it, like watching Polly Shore make an ass out of himself.The best part of the film, if you were going to buy it at all, has to be the 2D flapping birds of death. That was at least worth watching. However, if you're looking for a movie that's so bad it's good, watch Killer Klowns From Outer Space, Silent Night Deadly Night II or The Room."
2,Get this movie for the Rifftrax,"Wow. If you want to see a bad movie it doesn't get better then this. There is no real script,it's just a rip off of dozens of other movies and tv show. The SFX are worse then those in the almost 50 year old movie The Birds(one of the movies it rips off,think about that for a second. There are no actors in this thing,just friends of the director giving the worst line reads you will ever see. Don't even get me started on the sound. If you held the cheapest mike you could find in wal mart under water you would get a better recording of sound then this movie has. This movie is the worst thing I have ever seen,Plan Nine,The Room,and Manos look like Citizen Kane compared to this garbage.One thing I will say is that the disc is pack with extras,if you want to know how the worst movie ever made was made you can find out.Only get this movie if you want a good laugh and/or you are getting the Rifftrax."
1,In the words of Comic Book Guy: Worst Movie Ever!!,"Holy crap! The budget on this movie must have been six dollars! The only thing in the known universe that made this movie watchable was the glorious Rifftrax riff provided by Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett (you must purchase the Rifftrax seperately from their website, for those of you who are unfamiliar with them). If you own this movie, get the Rifftrax! That is NOT a suggestion, it's a demand!!"
1,Stay away from this movie!,"This movie might be made as a joke. Still, it's not funny at all. Some movies are so bad they're almost good. This isn't one of them. Please, stay away from this piece of garbage.And oh, the Blu-ray looks like crap. You've been warned."
1,"BEST JUSTIFICATION FOR A ""NO STARS"" OPTION PLEASE!","As most reviewers have unanimously agreed, This is the ""best"" worst movie ever made. I just think it's THE worst movie ever made! Granted, I howled in sheer disbelief at the hilariously awful bird effects, but that certainly isn't meant to be complimentary. Writer/director (?) James Nguyen may have been a precocious child running around making home movies with his family but he evidently suffers from Peter Pan syndrome and has never grown up.There are no redeeming qualities and its undeserved cult status has prompted an upcoming sequel called BIRDEMIC - THE RESURRECTION and Alan Bagh is reprising his role as Rod. If Bagh isn't the worst actor in cinematic history, I don't know who is. I won't go into the other horrible ""actors"", the absence of sound editing, the pompous global warming warning. The birds sum it up---unless you want to experience the most embarrasing 90 minutes in the anals (oops..annals) of movie history, AVOID."
3,Grab Your Coathangers!,"Terribly written, horribly directed, and barely acted . The poor deluded director thinks he is the next Hitchcock but he is more like the next Ed Wood- who would have loved those fake birds. The movie is more entertaining than many big budget Hollywood movies-so if you are in the mood for unintentional comedy- this one is keeper."
5,Probably the greatest film of our time,I really loved this movie and so does everyone that I share it with. Do not hesitate. Buy it now.
1,my intelligence was very insulted,"i saw the bluray disc version of this movie and the price is so cheap that i was able to buy in best buy. when i played this at home i was very insulted specially my intelligence. this is very bad, the acting, the graphics of the birds..pls refund my money. i was going to give this movie negative star but it wont let me."
4,Awesomely terrible,"The terribleness of this film is completely awesome. The acting is absurdly hilarious, as are the bird graphics, audio levels, and the plot. I cannot wait to share this with friends. I wouldn't say it's the best horrible movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely up there. People complaining about the movie must not have much of a sense of humor and/or must have completely failed to read any reviews or information about the movie. Certainly do not buy/rent/watch this movie if you expect to get anything meaningful or serious out of it."
5,Practical and Motivating!,"This book is down-to-earth with information that you can actually USE! I've read so many of the other ""plans"" and self-help books out there, with little or no results to show for it. I think they were written for ""other people"". In ""Success Secrets"", Breckon walks you through painless yet effective and real lifestyle changes that actually work. It's such an easy system and yet it has helped me focus and start fresh again on the road to having more time, more money, and being more in control of my own life ... and that's a great feeling! With his system, I've even been able to drop a few pounds (already!) and have more energy and motivation! It's a great book!"
2,"Superficial, & Unoriginal","A simplistic and generalized ""program"". Save your spare change, get a better job if you don't like where you work, and to start some kind of business are some of the strategies put forth. No real substance or detailed plans. I would have been very upset if I paid $21.95 for this. (Fortunately, I found it for just a few dollars.)"
2,Not Enough Information,I have spent a total of several years travelling around Costa Rica doing research. This book's large print and short length make it virtually impossible to cover the subject in depth and adequately. I found it rather superficial and lacking many details. Based on what I read there is a paucity of essential information for potential residents. More research is needed on a variety of subjects.
3,Not as Complete as I Thought,This guide seems to be pieced together and far too subjective rather than factual. I also found it to be incomplete in several key areas about living here in Costa Rica. My husband and I prefer some of the other guides on the same subject.
5,"The ""Real"" Story about Settling in Costa Rica","Potholes to Paradise is an honest, informative book that describes securing residency in Costa Rica as well as setting up a business there. It goes the extra mile with personal accounts of the Borners trying to forge a new life in Costa Rica and personal anecdotes from visitors staying with the Borners. I definitely would recommend this book to both travelers, retirees looking for a new place to call home, or those wanting to do business in Costa Rica."
4,"Thoughtful and thought-provoking, full of information....","Tessa Borner doesn't mince words. She & husband Martin love their new life and business in the Central Highlands of Costa Rica. But, paradise wasn't achieved without trials and tribulations. Hers is a very practical reminder of the follies the average North American can face in trying to create a new life in a Third World country. She tells us that Costa Rica may be a lovely spot for R&R from the cold and busy pace of northern winters, but it takes determination and a great deal of common sense to make the transition permanent. Tessa's pragmatism is laced with humour and fondness for her new home and life in paradise. We will personally be guided by their experience."
2,Review of Potholes,"Things seem to have changed since this book was written. There is some good info., but I was amazed how much isn`t accurate. There are also some disparaging remarks made about the Costa Ricans which are far too subjective. The author must have had some bad experiences."
2,A big disappointment!,My husband purchased this book to find out about retiring in Costa Rica. The book is well written but we decided that it was incomplete in several important areas and not up to date.
2,Out of Date,"I was rather disappointed with this book. It was published in 2001 and is therefore over 10 years old. Much has changed in Costa Rica since then, not only pricing and infrastructure, but also laws and immigration procedures. Most of the information is out of date and therefore basically useless. The book would be more interesting if they produced a new edition. A pity."
5,Glad to know that there are potholes in paradise!,You just have to drive on the roads of Costa Rica to find out what potholes are. It is a dream for my wife and I to move down to Costa Rica and have been thinking about it quite a while. We were glad to come across this fascinating book by Tessa Borner. We think that we will be able to make better decisions and certainly be more aware of the potholes ahead. We highly recommend this book.
2,Save Your Money,"The authors can't be serious! I really didn't get any benefit from this book. I just moved to Costa Rica and didn't learn much from it. It just doesn't contain enough info. for the potential resident. I read other books on the subject and prefer ""The New Golden Door"" and ""Choose Costa Rica."" The authors of these guides really seem to know the scoop."
2,I concur with the readers who gave it the same low rating,"The table of contents makes this book seem more complete than it really is. The last forty pages are a diary, thus reducing the useful content to only 130 pages. The book constantly plugs the author's bead & breafast business. Furthermore, the whole book seems to designed for Canadians rather than people from the U.S."
1,Other books on the topic are 100% better,"This is the first time that I have ever been motivated to write a review. There is virtually no useful information here which cannot be garnered from other more comprehensive and literate books on the topic.It is written from a very personal viewpoint, which would be interesting if the author was a writer. As it is, this is one of the worst books I have read in several years."
4,"Petite, attractive and comfortable.","No one likes wearing a med ID, but this was definitely the most attractive, subtle and comfortable bracelet I found. It's light without seeming flimsy, and I don't feel like people are staring at my wrist the way they did with the larger ID I had before. The only complaint that I have is that the Caduceus charm appears to be silver and red painted plastic. It doesn't look bad, but I'm worried about the sturdiness of it. Overall, this is a great price for a good product."
1,Cheap looking...,"I've been looking around for a nice, 3 stone ring like this one for quite a while now. I finally settled on this one because of the picture. And by looking at the picture of this ring online - you might be misled like I was into thinking it doesn't look like a cheap ring. Don't be fooled. It looks terrible.After spending about $40 on this ring plus shipping, I am very displeased with this ring. It really does look like it came out of a quarter machine. The stones look like plastic (they don't shine and look like very poor quality cubic zarconia), and the band itself looks like cheap metal that would break easily if enough pressure was applied. I could get a better ring from Wal-Mart for $15 that looks better then this one - and I am serious. I'm very unhappy with this ring.A definite return of this item... Don't waste your money. You really wont like it."
1,Terrible audio,"For what could have been a good concert DVD this fails miserably. Brentwood seems to have trouble with quality audio even on their CDs, but this is a disaster. The mixing leaves the singers sounding muffled and frequently washed out by the orchestra. A disappointment. Save your money."
3,Not all it is cut out to be...,"This book is good but in does not go into great detail with things such as history, magical symbols, names of the gods an godesses. Nothing in here that you wouldn't find in a good book by Scott Cunningham."
3,Avoid niche books!,"If you are looking for good introductory or practical practice, skip this work. If you want to read a sometimes interesting story about one person's journey, this is not bad. I just don't see it as a ""must-have."""
5,Educational especially for teenagers,"My daughter found this book in the library, Surprised, because I have been a secret wicca mother for over fifteen years, I read this book with her. I found the information extremely well worded and was pleased she wrote 'common sense' This book will teach you Wicca and how to use it sensible. ** An excellent Book** Recommend for teenagers wanting to learn real witchcraft"
4,a warning,"This is a brilliant book, but I must warn you, its not a very easy read if you don't already understand some concepts of wicca. I reccoment simpler books if you're just starting out, because this is a book full of insight more than basic facts. It not a book wityh gerneral information on the subject, its about how to expand youre magickal life, and how to grow and develop it. If you're a begginner, I reccoment an easier book to cut you're teeth on. But overall, this is a wonderful book."
5,"Well grounded, modern approach, easily appriciatable","This book stands out in that, much like Silver Ravenwolf's To Ride a Silver Broomstick, it aids a novice in that most difficult of any task; moving beyond reading about the subject of practicing to actually *doing* so. It's willingness to look into the specific problems related to those who are under 18 sets it aside from many other books which assume that the reader is more likely to be approached by an underage individual than to actually be the underage individual seeking knowledge. As any seeking teenage Pagan will tell you, it is strongly disheartening to see that most books do not recommend that adults support underage individuals. It's wonderful to see Madam Hunter address the subject in a relevent, informative manner. I loan my copy of this book out to other people who express interest in my beliefs, and most end up buying their own copy. I would suggest you do so, too."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!,"Merry Meet, I just wanted to let everyone know that this book is absolutely wonderful - I've been a practicioner of Wicca for many years now and have read many books on the subject. However, this book really turned my head. Refreshing and wonderfully written. Every beginner should have this book when they're starting out, and I feel that every ""advanced"" practicioner should grab a copy as well - Blessed Be and Merry Meet Again, .g"
4,21st Century Wicca A useful guide for the College aged Pagan,"21st Century Wicca is a useful resource for someone interested or starting out in the Wiccan tradition. Jennifer Hunter gears her Guide towards the 17-30 range, giving advice on the Days of Celebration, ritual tools, and meeting Wiccan/Pagan contacts along with a useful directory for groups and information. Ms. Hunter also gives advice to the teenage,college bound, and college age Wiccan that is from true life experiences. She also interviews Wiccans of all ages to give some insight into the lifestyle."
5,R. Dean Taylor's CD is wonderful,"R.Dean Taylor's CD is excellent, and deserving 5 STARS, in my opinion. All the selections are great, with my favorite song being, ""Indiana Wants Me"". I like songs that tell a story in the lyrics, and this artist does just that."
3,"Good approach, but poor editing","This books approach, teaching JS by programming games is effective, but the way the programs are layed out is confusing. In one chapter, the program is presented in parts, but it is VERY confusing how they go together, and parts of the program are left out entirely, which makes the program not work at all (Petals around the Rose, ch.6). An editor should be used who can correct programs, as well as correctling spelling."
5,The most enjoyable railroad book I have read.,"My comments will be brief, as the fine review already provided by James Heidel is accurate and complete. I intend only to convince any of those who are unsure of buying this book that this really is a great value. Simply excellent writing combined with ample information has resulted in the best book I have read about railroading."
5,Best Apple Corer of All Time!,"I've tried alot of apple corer and this one is the best I've tried! Very study handle, sharp blade that punches thru apples very quickly. We eat alot of baked apples in the winter and this corer has really helped my preparation time. If you are even considering another brand just give this one a chance too, it's less expensive and does a phoenomenal job! Happy eating!"
2,Peeler/Corer,"I was looking for a peeler/corer that had a sharp point which would allow me to leave the bottom of baked apples intact. I bought this one, but it's pretty cheap and flimsy. Granted, I didn't pay much but I expected it to be a bit more substantial. It's probably the kind of thing I'll find amidst the kitchen stuff at an estate or garage sale. I wouldn't buy this one again."
2,meh.. there's better books out there,"This booklet isn't bad, but it is mostly example projects to go through. After being only magazine size and 64 pages, that leaves little room for tips, instruction of advice. Being generous, its the first 18 pages where there is any info that's useful.I would recommend looking elsewhere, such asMachine Quilting Made EasyorEasy Machine Quilting."
2,Lightweight,"This is a disappointing book. The one feature that redeems it is the section at the end with lots of ideas for different ways of quilting continuous lines to produce for example rows of stars. The suggestions here would be quick and unfussy to do, not involving any (or maybe a little) marking and measuring. The main part of the book (it's quite short) shows actual quilts with some of their designs. It certainly does not show you how to machine quilt if you have not done much before."
1,"Show Me How to Machine Quilt: A Fun, No-Mark Appro",It's not what I was expecting. No good for beginers.
4,Good but not the best,I like this whole product line. These are a little moist and not very substantial feeling. The peanut butter ones are harder but leave you feeling like you had some real food.
2,Not impressed,Try a smaller pack first to make sure you will like it before buying a large pack like this.
3,"It is okay, but not great.","I found that the seat is a little small in this chair. Well, maybe small isn't exactly what I mean - it's more that I like the kind without the front ""tray"". My sister has the style without the tray and my child really likes that kind better. Also, this print may seem like a good neutral, but it's really kinda icky for a little girl. If you want a neutral I'd go with light green or navy instead. This color is really drap and looks awful with her ""girl"" colored clothes/blankets. Actually, if with boy stuff it might be kinda BLAH. Overall product is okay, but I really do not like the color - ESPECIALLY FOR A GIRL!"
4,My son loves it!,"Great swing. Two things about it make me give it 4 stars instead of 5. First, the music is annoying, but that is true of every baby item we have that makes noise, even Baby Einstein CDs. Second, the way that the toys are hooked to the tray makes it so that they hit on the side of the swing when you raise the tray (and of course they make noise and can wake baby up....not good if you have just worked hard to get him to sleep!)"
1,Mobile falls on babys head,"1. the bears on the mobile are boring2. the mobile falls off, HITTING BABY ON HEAD! I have tried several times to replace the mobile securely resulting in it falling off again and again.3. My son cannot seem to get comfortable in seat. I went to a friends house and he loved her little girls, the winnie the pooh swing from wal-mart. It snuggles them unlike the mocha where their legs just dangle.4. the only thing this swing is good for is to complete the mocha collection. Which if I had read reviews before purchasing this would NOT have been the one I bought."
4,Life saver!!!,"This swing has served wonders for my husband and I. My son is three months old and since the beginning, he would not go to sleep unless I rocked him while standing up for about an hour. Finally, we decided to try the swing and I'm glad we did. He falls asleep in minutes! He loves to stare at the bears mobile and when he does fall asleep, you can turn the volume down on the music. The straps are adjustable to a large size which is great is you have a chunkier baby like mine. There are six different speeds to choose from according to your baby's liking. This was one of the best gifts I got for my baby shower!"
1,After 3 months it broke,"I bought this exact swing in the Windsor pattern (the whole line of Windsor actually) and when my son 3 months and 2 days old the swing just quit working. It would swing like the batteries were dying, but they were new. I called the Babiesrus toll free number and they said I would have to call my local store. The local store basically said tough luck, its over 90 days. Well with baby items you buy them well in advance to prepare for your new arrival, you wouldn't even know that the item was faulty within that time frame. I paid $100 so I would get a high quality item that would last. But that was not the case. My replacement swing and any other baby items will be purchased at Walmart since they have a reasonable return/exchange policy. You would think that Babiesrus runs into this a lot with baby items, but I assume they just don't care."
3,The best of what was available,"This book was a gift for friends that hosted my baby shower. I did a lot of searching for a great book that told them how thankful I was and how important it is that I have them close to me to be an important part of our babies life. The book is good, but not great. Some chapters are better than others but it served the purpose."
1,Can the Canned Information,"This book appears to have been written by a computer, not a human. It is devoid of any insightful information, and the banal quality of the book suggests that the author knows nothing about plumbing -- certainly no plumbing expertise was required to write the book. In fact, it is likely that by simply changing the words ""plumbing business"" with the click of a word processing button, that the book's advice could apply equally well to any other business on this earth. Invest your hard-earned money in your business, not in this unexciting book."
2,"Somewhat helpful, but not all-inclusive","This book is a hit and miss. It's like a batter hitting a pitch straight back for a foul ball; it usually means he's right on the pitch and was expecting it, but he just missed it.Some missions in the game are not even talked about in the book, and to my frustration, some of those not in the book were some of the hardest missions I played. Most, after time, you will be able to solve. However, you occasionally will need a little help. I was not happy to discover that this book left out a mission here and a mission there.It does not talk about in-depth strategies to the game either. It is a surface-scratcher, and superficial at that. While it does have its redeeming qualities (it IS a strategy book, so it isn't all that useless), there are probably websites out there that would probably be a little more helpful than this book was."
4,MSI's Worst,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this album. I bought it the day it came out, and it actually had some very weak tracks. For those who aren't MSI freaks, you need to understand that MSI's previous two studio albums (not including Los Ninos), Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy and Tight, were amazing. There was not one unlistenable track (out of 30 on Frankenstein). Everything was amazing.This CD is different - it's still got some good tracks remniscent to Tight, such as Stupid MF, Two Hookers and an Eightball, Shut Me Up, and 1989. However, there's only 10 tracks here - short ones - and it makes for a 26 minute album with about 15 minutes as high quality as Tight and Frankenstein Girls. It's still worth the money - anything by MSI is better than anything on almost any radio station, and for hella sure better than anything on the Top 40 - but it's not up to par with the other albums."
2,"MSI Rock! Shame about the recording,...","Was first introduced to Mindless Self Indulgence by a friend, who passed me a copy of the cd,Unfortunately, if youre a fan of the band, then don't under any circumstance by this version the album as anything that maybe the american market could deem to be slightly offensive has been missed off leaving you with a recording that just has random gaps in it throughout the entire album.Fine, its my own fault for not reading the description properly but this has sincerely spoiled a great album.."
3,Of Course MSI is good...,"...but a 3 year wait for THIS? seriously. i was thinking some huge 3 disc set with 30+ songs on each with that amount of time taken. then we get this 20 minute CD with some of MSI's most mediocre material ever. i am very dissaponited. its like you didnt try on purpose. come on guys, i know you guys made this in a week and just released it to fool us and now your going to come out with a huge CD this summer, right? please say yes, because this just makes me want to cry. theres about 3 good songs on the cd, thats the only reason it got 3 stars."
1,MSI Dropped The Ball On This One!,"This album sucks! It flat out sucks. I wasn't going to get it at first because my musical tastes have changed a little since the last MSI album. all thought i had listened to them recently so i decided to give it a whirl.The songs on here sound so forced and rushed. After you've heard one you've heard them all. Its not nerly as raw and clever as their previous efforts. its short as hell and its so obnoxious its painful to listen too. Not to mention they truely disgrace Rush's ""Tom Sawyer."" You'll Rebel To Anything lives up to its name. Hardcore MSI fans are sure to love this. But if you ask me, making fun or retarded people, pretending you like rap music, and obnoxious falcetos just aren't funny the third time around."
2,this cd is awful,"this band sucks i bought this 2 months ago it,s bad very bad i like static x and minstry but thesse people suck to high heaven only 3 songs are any good . Besides mars volta they suck too Deadsy verison of rush,s tomsawyer was great either but it was better than mindless verison .i did like track 3 and track 6 and track 7. the rest really bad deadsy new cd is better than this cd so much better i am not PUNK ROCK FAN I DON,T HATE IT . it just not my style today punk from 2000 to now i like A.F I BUT I i like more of prog metal that is my main foucs if going to be alt rock it got to be some goth/ industrial this band is awful ."
5,Aces!,"This album is utterly fantastic. If you're a fan of experimental music, or even if you're a fan of the gross-out teen comedy genre, you'll get an absolute kick out of Mindless Self Indulgence.Probably their best known song is Shut Me Up, and if you love that track, you're going to love the rest of the album.It's a fantastic album from a fantastic band. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Just don't listen to it with your parents or younger siblings. You've been warned!"
5,Simply amazing,"I don't review music typically, but this album is spectacular. After owning it for 3 years, I still love it. If you are new to MSI, as I was at the time, this album will grow on you even more as you get into it. The songs are so hard, the lyrics are funny and mean spirited. The title track describes absolutely how I feel about whiny emo kids. The subsequent album ""If"" doesn't draw me in immediately like this one did. If you are new to them, buy this album. I've heard people say they are embarrassed to play this album around friends, I do it all the time. This group has more talent than most, and the tracks are in-your-face nonstop just plain hard. They are short because they were done at the end and didn't drag them out with filler to make them more ""standard""."
4,Admit it... They're Good,"After the first listen, MSI seems highly obnoxious, but that's probably because you can't understand the lyrics. Listen to them again. MSI is groundbreaking. They're like Nine Inch Nails on crack. They're intelligent, entertaining and creative. I'd recommend this album and all their old ones to anyone who can appreciate pure wit spit out without any frills."
3,It gonna rain!,"Well Well Well...Iv been a Mindless fan since 99, and sorry guys but the CD's not their best (at all)...It's a good disc but {I had to hear to it a few times} the music is to diffrent. Like -1989- the mp3 version,thats mindless, the new one sounds like a MSI cover band.and it's only 5 new songs!Mindless ya know i luv ya but come out with a real CD guys."
5,quit your complaining,"this is a great album!!!!!!! this is what happens when a band progresses, if bands wouldn't try new things then their sound would always be the same, and all their songs would sound the same. this album is soooo great, and like everything else MSI it is an aquired taste! and takes a while to get used too."
1,this band sucks,my god what has the world come too....this bad is so called unique...hell thats becasue they suck worse than anyone else before them....total insult to rock/metal. This is pop.
5,More MSI is good,"I came across some of their stuff from Tight and Frankenstien and it took a few listens to get past the initial shock, but its now one of my favorite bands.This new album is.... more professional? I dunno, its definetly MSI and definetly good, but smoother somehow. Similar to the difference between Tool's Undertow and Lateralus, both awesome, but the second more evolved. Or like Incubus's Enjoy compared to SCIENCE, more refined, still awesome.Anyway, I think anyone who can appreciate good music of any genre will appreciate this, its like nothing else."
4,Better approach to the subject for an intro,Typically books of this nature are shrouded in cryptic and terse (albeit mathematically precise) theory. This book reworks the presentation in a more understandable way (e.g. non-determinism is presented early and used often; the term automata is dropped for the more descriptive term finite machine). I used this text last fall (fall '99) for an intro course on automata and formal languages and I plan on using it again.
1,Not an introductory book at all!,"I took this course from one of the authors and it was awful. The examples were bad, and did not have enough practice problems to learn the basics - it assumed you could get the material straight from the reading. Unfortunately, this course was not worth the time and money I spent on it."
1,The book does not explain the subject clearly.,It was a nightmare taking the course and we had to spend a lot of time understanding the contents as they are very abstract.I had a tough time going through the course and it created an aversion to the subject itself.
1,I had a hard time even with the author teaching the course!,"This book is not for the beginner. It has very few examples and explanations. The only good part is that a few of the problems have solutions, but the examples in the book do not coincide with the exercises. There are proofs for every definition, but it is not clear how these concepts tie in with one another. Also, the order in which the material is presented is a little odd. All the different machines are introduced first, with very little explanation. Then regular expressions and contezt free grammars are discussed, which is discussed first in most books on this subject. Then, The Halting Problem is dicussed. I had a hard time following the book even when one of the authors taught the class."
1,A nightmare for newcomers.,"If you are familiar with this subject, I am sure this book will be informative. But when used in an introductory course to this subject it is terrible. The writing is very technical. The problems are all expert level. There are very few solved problems so it is difficult to know if you are really learning anything."
2,"BAD MOVIE, BETTER VIDEOS","THIS MOVIE HAD AN ALRIGHT STORY LINE, BUT THE ACTING SUCKED AND THE MOVIE IS NOT LONG AT ALL, LIKE 45 - 1 HOUR LONG. INSTEAD OF THE MOVIE WATCH IT FOR THE VIDEOS WIT ALL THEM GURLZ IN THEM, DOING "" THINGS "" TO EACHOTHER. "" DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE THOUGH "" BORROW IT FROM SOMEONE OR RENT IT."
3,Not bad for the time,"This TIE pilot wasn't bad for the late 1990s, and as such it has limited articulation. It's a decent option if you need figures to pilot your TIE Fighters, but later in the summer of 2011 there's a Vintage version coming out featuring full articulation and a removable helmet. I'd suggest picking up those ones."
5,defintely interesting,This book was in very good condition and it was delivered promptly. The content is definitely interesting and what I was looking for in a biography. The writer's style is informative and accurate. It gives excellent insight into the world of Plath.
4,a must have...,"I'm new to Iyengar Yoga(3 months). This book is a good complement toyour teacher's instructions, and very helpful for a new student. There is so much to learn! I found it especially helpful in assisting me to study background information, a description of how the poses are done, cautions and health benefits to many poses. The photographs of Yogi Iyengar are especially helpful to someone who is new to this amazing type of yoga."
1,Not worth it,I returned the book I received because it was not in good condition and it was not what I expected. The book is very small and overpriced. I suggest getting the original Light On Yoga instead. This is a scaled down version of that book.
4,RECLAIMING OUR TIES,"For many of us community appears as an illusive dream. Although we are born into and nurtured by a community, our present culture has disconnected us from our roots. We've become anonymous denizens of materialism divorced from one another.The Community of Kindness enables us to break free of the sense of alienation from community. This compact little book contains brief viginettes of a cross section of people sharing their stories of building community. It provides a road map in enabling us to reclaim and restore our ties with one another.This isn't a work of nostalgia or a tome about people doing superhuman tasks in forming community. Ordinary people have taken small steps to help affirm one another as caring individuals. On reading this book your faith in the goodness of humanity will be restored. Enjoy the stories. Laugh, cry but most of all remember community can be restored but it begins with you. Reclaim and affirm your community."
4,Behind the scenes of an uncompleted Nazi Propaganda film,Behind the scenes of an unfinished Nazi Propaganda film about the Warsaw Ghetto. Fascinating. Unsettling. Sometimes disturbing (as it should be).
3,It is worth a look.,"When it comes to WWII especially anything to do with the war in Poland I'm interested, this was a collection of unedited footage taken by German cameramen regarding the Warsaw Ghetto, it does give a realistic picture of the lengths the Germans would go through to show the west that the Jewish population was doing well under their control, and also shows a lot of the misery these people went through before being shipped off to their eventual deaths. It is worth the watch and I would purchase it again."
3,Oblong table pad,"Purchased this pad as a replacement for one we purchased many years ago. The pad received was an out of shape oblong. No big deal as we had to cut it to fit our dining room table. It was folded many times and is much thinner than the pad we replaced. It was easy to cut. We are unable to remove the creases from the pad, having tried the hair dryer and warm/hot towels. Just cannot remove them. This pad will give some protection from spills but be careful what you may drop on it as it is thin. Will have to live with the creases and just be careful where we place a glass where it may tip over. If you are looking for a replacement pad try to find this on a roll at one of the larger department stores."
5,Golden Acrylic Gesso 8oz Jar,This product works just fine and does what I want it to do on my creative functions. Thank you very much.....
4,"it's not perfect, but it's the best I've tried.","I really like not having a dirty brush dripping all over or sitting next to the toilet. I wish these heads had the scrubbing part on the sides, or at least one side, to get under the rim better. I've never lost one in the toilet, but that's always my biggest fear, it just doesn't seem that secure. But it cleans pretty well and is great for keeping the toilet clean making those heavy scrubbing less often. They are expensive, as I only use one each cleaning, but I guess you could clean a couple toilets with one head before tossing it, especially if you use it daily. all in all, I haven't found anything I like better, that is easier or cleans better."
5,Easy and Quick Toilet Cleaning,I have been using the Clorox Toilet Wand for years. I really like the convenience of the product but was upset when I couldn't find the refills in our local stores. Shopping with Amazon saved the day. I am very happy with my purchase and with the continued ease of the Clorox Toilet Wand in keeping my toilet fresh and clean.
3,Not very strong cleaning solution,"I do use these every week, however I don't think the cleaning solution on the heads are that great, I don't think it would truly disinfect a toilet, so I do put regular toilet bowl cleaner in there to let it soak for 10 minutes, then scrub it out with these heads, Kind of defeats the purpose, but I still like being able to dispose of the head each time. Maybe the solution works great, but there is no way it can truly disinfect the toilet, there is just not enough there."
5,Clorox Toilet Wand Cleaning Refills,"I love this way of cleaning the toilets, It's not messy! however when pricing buying the boxes of 6 individually, it was so expensive. Buying in bulk saves money and shopping time. Thanks Amazon!"
5,clorox,This is a great product. Ease of use & no mess to clean up afterwards. Just throw away. Would recommend to everyone.
4,"IT'S THE ""WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT"" OF WATERFOWLING","THIS BOOK OFFERS SOME OF THE BEST IDEAS I'VE EVER SEEN. WHILE IT ISN'T AN INSTRUCTIONAL BOOK, GREEN WINGS AND VETS ALIKE CAN TAKE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE FROM THE THE DEN TO THE BLIND. IT IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS YOU ENJOY READING AND RE-READING. GET IT!!"
4,Worth Ordering,"No matter how long you've been hunting you are sure to find two or three useful tips for your next outing. I was a little upset to find a ""less-than-ecological"" tip envolving anti-freeze. Hopefully nobody will use it."
4,Accurate and Useful,"I keep the main gauge downstairs and the second (remote) gauge upstairs.It lets me know the temperature in the whole house without me going upstairs to check.The easy to read display helps as well.The ""remote"" has a thermometer display on it too so I don't have to be at the main station to see the temperature.One bad thing is that there is no light or backlight.When the room is dark, you can't see the display very well.For that reason, I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars."
2,This guy is not a professional poker player,"Daniel Kimberg says in the book that he is not a professional.If you were 'serious' about something you would be a professional or at least attempt to be one. This guy is not a professional poker player and gives advice like a novice. If you can't make it you should not be writing books, especially not 'serious' ones."
2,Looking for practical tips from the book? Look elsewhere.,"I bought the cards expecting practical tips/details from the book. I intended to put them in places where I needed the information. For example, when doing my bills/receipts, I wanted a card that lists what receipts are worth keeping. (No such card is included in this deck.) Instead the cards are mostly inspirational quotes, such as ""If you can find what you need quickly and easily, then you're organized!"" The book gets five stars, and the cards, two."
5,THA KLYMAXX !,"THIS CD OFFERS ALL OF THEIR SINGLES . MOST OF THE TRACKS ARE REAL GEMS . ALL OF THEM ARE WELL PRODUCED,ARRANGED AND SUNG .I URGE YOU TO GO OUT AND BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE SOFT ROCK , BEAUTIFUL BALLARDS AND GREAT UPTEMPO MATERIAL .I ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING CD'S: GWEN GUTHRIE-""THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION"", VERONICA-""RISE"", NENEH CHERRY-""HOMEBREW"" ,NIKKI COSTA-""EVERYBODY GOT THEIR SOMETHING"", PHYLLIS HYMAN-""MASTER HITS : PHYLLIS HYMAN,TEENA MARIE-""IVORY"", TALOR DAYNE-""SOUL DANCING"", TRINA&TAMARA-""TRINA&TAMARA"" ,ALYSON WILLIAMS-""RAW"".SIGNED MUSIC FAN."
5,this took me way back,"The cd was brand new and well packaged. I have memories of klymaxx being played on cassette tape by my mother, so I decided to order two copies (one for her and one for me). It sounds crisp and clear, as if we were right back in the early 80's reliving the moments! Must have"
4,Retro-80's please!!!,This is so much fun to listen to. Takes me back to a very fun time in life. I was blessed to have grown up in the 80's!!!
1,Don't waste your time,"What a load of pretentious c**p! I'm gonna take a guess here that the writer has never taken this drug before and also hasn't bothered to research her subject either. Especially as she has written more books about drugs - great premise, c**p delivery! After knowing a meth addict I was expecting something much more gritty and real - this was like a fairytale compared to what the experience is truly like. The poems are bad to say the least and i'm not even sure why this is in the top 10 books for young adults - it seems to glorify the drug in parts. If you want to waste your money go ahead and buy it, if you want to waste your time borrow if from the library, if you don't want to waste either stay clear."
4,I LOVE THIS BOOK,I am very undecided when it comes to purchasing things online but i found this book and i just had to have it. The book was mailed to me i wonderful condition there was some normal where and tear but nothing extreme. After i recieved the book and finished it in two days i bought another book i hope that this book is as good as the last. : )
5,Classically Great.,"Crank is perhaps one of my all time favorite books. It really changed the way I thought about drugs. The story itself is amazing, and the format is perfect. I really love this book and would HIGHLY recommend it."
5,"Strikingly Real, and Obliviously Present","This book brings to light the little known affects of meth use. Although it is written in ""poetry"" format, it helps to show the way the girl's mind it working at the time. The worse she gets and the more addicted she is, the more erractic the writing is. It shows that there are things much more scary than pot and alcohol to parents who are concerned with those only. It shows that the good kids make wrong decisions too. And it shows that no matter how hard they try, they are hooked for life. As much as people would like to believe that this is a non-issue, they are wrong. Meth use has increased and little is done for the prevention of it. As a high school student I know that all the emphasis is put on the ""gateway"" drugs, but in this book, they seemed more like front porch drugs, and meth was the walkway."
4,Made me love my life,"Ok, so I'm not rich. I'm not famous. I'm not even as thin as I would like. But at least I'm not the character Hopkins portrays in these two books. ""Riveting"" doesn't describe the feeling I got reading this series - it's simply a train wreck that can't be stopped. I think at some point I wanted to reach into the book and take this girl out of the dismal situation she'd put herself into. I literally could not put the books down. And although the second book lacks the poetic flair of the first, the story is a heart-breaking (albeit predictable) story of addiction, apathy, and pain."
4,mind blowing!,"I love the way Ellen Hopkins portrays the story through prose form. I caught myself reading ""Crank"" at lightning fast speeds because of how capturing her writing is. With writing in prose forms it offered me a new way of reading a book and having to learn how to read a book written this way. It was refreshing and daring. ""Crank"" is a detailed book about life, love, friends, family and drugs. You won't be disappointed."
5,great read!,a sad but insightful view into the dark reaches of drug addiction and how it affects not only the user but everyone around them.
5,Can't beat this book.,"I am twelve and this stoy showed me how to feel like I was a part of the book, I think this book is like the best book ever and I have read the twilight books."
4,Disturbing,Ellen Hopkins definitely knows how to write a tough but captivating book. After reading her latest novel Tricks I found myself wanting to revisit this dark world that she has created and Crank does not disappoint. Crank did not pack the punch or push the envelope like Tricks did but the story still caught my attention right away. While reading I found out that the characters and events that happened were actually a true story from Hopkins herself and her family. This made the book come way more alive to me and I also discovered that she plans for this to be set in a trilogy. I will definitely continue on with the series and I think the next book will be an even harder read for me personally.
4,Read it. Let your teen read it.,"They days of being invincible have gone the way of the dodo. Unfortuantely, the days of parents uttering the words ""not my child"" has become evermore prevalent...Crank, and subsequently Glass, is a relatively realistic picture of how choices made from insecurities can lead to a downward spiral. Hopkins' verse lent to the lifetime-in-a-moment world that many people life in. Not just teens.As for the style, though occasionally distracting when getting *into* the story, it was often purposeful in its design (see the opening pages and read the single words! Loved the not-so-hidden story!)Read this book. Let your teen read this book AFTERWARDS, and talk about its events. Have them read Glass as well. It's painful. Worth it."
5,This book is as addictive as the drug it's about!,"this was an amazing book. i was about to go to sleep one night around 1am and decided to start reading a little of this new book i got (crank). i figured i should read maybe 10 pages then go straight to bed as i was really tired. a few hours later i realized the sun was coming up and i was finished with the book.i've read other books on troubled teens (smack, cut, candy, etc.) and they didnt come close. the only reason people are giving this book a rating of 2s and 1s is because the novel is written in verse like a poem, however, i find that this style actually made it more fun to read, it's different. i actually felt like i was looking at things through the eyes of kristina/bree and i felt this described the rush you get while high and the pain and suffering better than a junkie can describe it.i HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone!"
4,a good read,i leave this one out on the coffee table. it's a great read for anyone.it's a deep dark look into something that a lot of people are afraid to talk about; drugs.a must read for everyone.
4,Compelling,"I do not normally buy this sort of work, preferring to stick to strictly fictional accounts not based in any sort of reality however, this book spoke to me from the moment i picked it up.I have no personal experience with drug use or abuse but the manner in which the author draws the reader in compelled me to read.I have three daughters of my own, one on the threshold of her teen years, just waiting to jump across the line and i felt this book to be a necessity in that right as well. She will read this book, even if it doesn't deter her in any way, she will read it. And we will discuss it, at length.Thank You Ellen Hopkins for sharing this story with us in all it's fictional and non-fictional parts."
4,Crank,"Crank is the story of a girls downward crank ( crystal meth) induced spiral. Written in free verse poetry, Crank is a quick read, even though it is near 600 hundred pages long, and it follows Kristina through her addiction. The only thing that I did not like about this book, was that it made it appear as though every teenager was addicted to speed, and that every one always had a bit of "" toot"" on them at all times, which simply isn't true. Crank serves as a cautionary tale, shining light on a subject not often raised. Very well written"
3,I liked it.,"In the beginning, I couldn't get the format. But afterwards, I began to love the story. It was boring sometimes, but I thought it kept me equally entertained. I really enjoyed it."
2,Awful Ebook,The storyline was good!! But the text did not transfer into a format that I could read on my iPhone.
3,Don't do meth,"When I received the book, I was really disappointed that it was not straight prose; its free verse structure just wasn't what I expected. I wasn't going to bother reading it at all before donating it to the library, but I got sucked in by the book's dedication, which basically gives away the whole story (it really should say ""spoiler alert""). I liked the story, if not the style. There were a few beautiful...verses? Turns of phrase, at least, but I really just powered through to find out what happened to the characters.It won't fall into my top young adult reads (I saw it on such a list and was motivated to buy it), but it definitely reinforced my decision not to do meth (""Winter's Bone"" taught me that first)."
4,Addicting,"Ellen Hopkins writes in Verse form. It's very straight to the point with very powerful words. I was very nervous about picking up a book in verse as I really do love reading novels, and it took me awhile (pg 70 or so) that she had me hooked. I found my heart racing in places during this story because of the intense emotion that is relayed in such few words. I would recommend this to not only older teens, but of course any parent of a teenager. I found this book completely relatable and definately recommendable."
3,crank,"did not like the way it was wrote,the poem style and how some of the words were so small.It was all over the page."
3,would be better if there werent so many typos!,I love Ellen Hopkins' writing! I have read Crank and Glass probably 5 times each now but decided to buy the trilogy because I haven't read Fallout yet but want to read the first two over again. I am very disappointed that there are so many typos in the kindle edition... I have found a few missing words as well as things being misspelled... I'm not sure what happened when the book was formatted for Kindle but it is driving me insane and I'm struggling to stay focused on the story. I am really regretting spending $26.99 on this set!
2,Not my style,"I couldn't really get into these books. I finished them, but I wouldn't read them again and won't continue with the rest of the series."
4,CRANK.....,"My favorite part about the book was the way she wrote it. The story itself was ok, but i enjoyed her style of writing more. You should def pick it up and read it! :)"
5,AWESOME!!,Ellen Hopkins is amazing! The way she writes is amazing! The way the book is written is crutial to the story line. I learned things in this book I had never thought about before. I suggest this book for any girl that wants to read something out of the ordinary.
4,very intense,"I just finished ""crank"". The book belongs to my 14yr old daughter and as a parent it was a very hard read. I worry every day about drugs and my children.I liked that the book was honest in the fact about how quickly this drug can hook you and about the terrible things an addict would go through to get their drug. I also like that it didn't gloss over the fact that date rape does happen and adding drugs to the mix just ups the chances. I do feel that it glamorizes drug use and goes even as far as explaining how to smoke crack using aluminum foil and a straw.I want my daughter to be aware of the dangers but I don't want to raise her curiosity enough that she wants to try it.The book was good. The poetry and the way it was written was very beautiful. The story hard to read because all I could think was that could be my daughter. I just want to recommend that parents should read the book before giving it to their teenager. Maybe even use the book to start a conversation about drugs."
5,poetry,I love this book. I have read many drug books in the past and trust me that none were quite like this. This book takes a different perspective on drugs and what I also really like about the book is that it doesn't have a fairy tale ending. What I abosolutely LOVE about the book is the poetry and the way a poem can say one thing and then it also says something else.
2,Real Help!,"If your going to rave about a book that helps kids stay off drugs, then have it be written by a drug addict!! This is a book written by a mother whose daughter used the drug Meth/crank. As an former meth/crank user, this book is based on what someone ""THINKS"" its all about, not what really goes on in a meth/crank users head. She writes what society has programed into her head, and yes her daughter had a hard time, it could just as well happened on booze. My point is get someone who honestly knows what meth/crank is like to write a book about meth/crank, not some well to do mom who thinks she knows what was in her daughters head. Does any Mother know whats in her daughters head?? Nope!!"
3,This was ok,This book was ok. It was interesting but not the best book I've ever read by any means. It does send a good message and give a better understanding of addiction to these types of drugs.
2,Not what I expected...,"The beginning of the book was written more like poetry rather than telling an actual story. The sentences were broken up and scattered all over the pages, very inconsistant. It's a little discouraging when you first start to read it and a bit confusing. Towards the middle it began telling more a story rather than poems about how the ""author"" felt which helped you get into the book more. Towards the end I just wanted to hurry up and finish it just to find out the ending without skipping to the end. The story line is good but poorly written, true or not."
5,Lifechaning poetry that kids read rapidly,"Over the last several years, I have purchased several copies of this book to give away to pre-teens and teenagers at risk. I give it to them and ask them to give it back to me when they are done with it. I open the book and show them the writing, and they usually jump right into it. Some of them give me the book back in a day or two.The book is ""concrete poetry,"" meaning that it's not just the words, but the presentation of the words on the page that are important.Preteens and teenagers find it honest, and it makes them think, and truly consider the dangers of drugs. That's huge. I work for the State of Nevada, and I have suggested that this book be used as part of a program to be used by inmates.To be honest, I must admit that I am an author, and I know Ellen Hopkins, but this review is *not* influenced by that professional relationship."
5,Amazing books,"Both of the books I got were great. I finished them in 2 days. They really get you hooked. If you love to read suspenful books, Please read these books! Then don't forget Fallout, the next bok in the sequel."
4,Fantastic,"I loved this book, couldn't put it down. I finished the book in one day, looking forward to reading the authors other books, just wish there was more to Kristina's story."
5,READ THIS BOOK NOW WITHOUT DELAY,"This book reiterates much of what I have found in my own walk with God, but something which the average Christian is unaware is available to him/her. IF YOU HAVE EVER SAID, ""I would follow God's will, if I only knew what He wanted. If only He would drop a little sign from Heaven..."", THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. You can know God's will. He wants you to know His will. This book will teach you how. Read it now without delay!"
5,Love this book,This book was great in showing me how much more I could be praying. I had never concidered praying over so many different things and I was able to read about how things could be greatly changed for the better if I started on this journey. I highly recommend this book. It is very encouraging.
1,WORST CHAINSAW EVER,Since Spring 2011 this thing has been in the shop more than in my possession. For MONTHS AND MONTHS we waited on the chain tightener issue to be repaired. Now the darned thing simply will not start and continue to run for more than 10 minutes. I am quite adept at reading the instructions and following them. My repair guys are warranty backed... This machine is a hunk of plastic junk. My words can not express my frustration and disappointment.
1,Very poor saw & poor customer support,We have gotten 4 poulan chainsaws and non of them have worked properly. The first one leaked oil very badly so we sent it back. The second one we got did not start at all. The third one leaked oil and we were told to take it to a poulan repair shop. They said that the oil chamber was cracked and that it should be returned to poulan. The fourth chainsaw that we got also leaks oil. We were told that the saw just needed to be run. Even after that the saw leaked worse. We are very dissapointed in this saw and the answers we got from Poulan. We are done with poulan chainsaws.
1,good for a year,"worked well for first year, cut about one cord of wood. second year idle could not adjust and began to stall out. took for repair and was told piston and cylinder were severely scratched and not worth fixing. advise, get the extended warranty or a different saw"
1,Not Happy!,"I purchased this chain saw as a gift. I received it in two days which was great. It ran for a few minutes after the initial start, then it quit immediately. I called the company and they told me it had to be calibrated for the state I live in. They gave me two places to take it too, one with a 2 week wait period the other with a 5 day wait time. Very disappointing. I have a new saw and no guarantee that it will work. The company I was directed to have the calibration done, told me they have never had to do this for new saw. I have always trusted Amazon to purchase items through but this purchase was a mistake."
2,A disposable chainsaw,"I got the chainsaw out of necessity. It did exaclty what I expected and then some.I used it once/twice and it was awesome. Once we moved I'd use it 3-4 times a week (and still under 3 gallons of fuel total) the chainsaw went belly up. Took it to a trusted show they informed me it had blown up. I then found out I had 2 year warranty on a 18 month old saw. Took to authorized dealer they told me it was carburator and not blown up at all and by taking it to the previous shop I voided my warranty. Yeah, my mistake there, but with no more than 3 gallons of gas in 18 months this should have never happened! So, now I am out $20 service call and a $139 chainsaw. My wife told me to buy a Stihl and the authorized service shop recommended Echo and then Stihl.For sale or trade one broke PP3516AVX. The PP should be POP for Piece of SxxT!My last Poulan product, unless they give me one."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this Poulan saw three years ago to cut up a neighbor's downed tree. Another neighbor beat me to the job so I didn't even put fuel and bar oil in it then. I finally used it this year. Worked reasonably well the first time. When I went to get it for the second use I noticed the bar oil had leaked out all over the shed shelf. I now know that ""Automatic Chain Oiler"" means gravity feed instead of oil pump. That means the bar oil will always leak out. My main problem is that the fuel cap has swollen from the ethanol in the gasoline. If I can ever get the damned cap out again, I'll shave it down as suggested in forums.I will keep it rather than trash it, but I will drain the bar oil and fuel after each use and leave the fuel cap off. AND, I will never buy another Poulan product. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK."
2,More time spent trying to start than cut,"We have had consistent problems with this chainsaw. Trying to get it to start is a chore in itself. I am used to some power tools not working since I bought a craftsman leaf blower so I have some experience in spending a significant amount of time trying to get this started. It usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get it up and running but once it is, it will not idle well. The plastic gas cap also does not fit property. I have to use pliers to install it. Once it is started, however, it does do the job well. I would look for another option or model if you are considering this item as it has lead to many headaches."
3,Just OK,"Only buy this chain saw if you have little use for one. It is lite duty all the way.I bought this saw to cut up some large branches from a tree. It is barely good enough for this job. The saw is very hard to start. As reported by several others the chain falls off regularly. For some reason my chain needs to be replaced and I am not yet done with this small job. I have no idea why this would be but it does not cut hardly at all and smokes the wood rather than cut it.I just hope that a new chain will work long enough to finish the job. All that being said I must in fairness say that I bought this saw as ""re-conditioned into like new condition"".Perhaps what I really got was re-conditioned into used condition. This may be why the chain wore out so fast."
2,Nearly useless!,"This saw starts and runs well enough. It also has enough power for what I intended. However, the ""Patented Tool-less Chain Tensioning System"" renders this saw nearly useless. You'll literally be tightening the chain every five minutes. No matter how tight you turn the cheap, plastic, fold-out piece that tightens the bar into place, the chain will loosen in five minutes or less. Also, the plastic housing or the gas cap itself has apparently absorbed the gas/fuel and now requires a large pair of plyers to remove and install. It's impossible to turn by hand and almost impossible to get it started back on. If you need a lightweight, inexpensive saw, Poulan is okay. Just stay away from the ones with the tool-less chain tensioner."
2,Burned out,"I bought this saw in 2005 for felling three small trees (18"" diameter) I would start the saw every 6 month and used fuel stabilizer when storing for long periods, in short this saw was babied. After major storm in 2010 the saw worked okay initially, but eventually became very difficult to start. It turned out that the engine had not enough compression to start. This saw just about broke me mentally and physically, exerting huge energy trying to start it. My advise is stay away from this saw, spend the extra $ for something you can rely on. If you gave me a new one for free I would not take it. You can not put a price on aggravation and frustration."
2,More Time Repairing Than Cutting,"When It cuts its fine. But these reviews are honest. The chain wont stay tightened no matter how many bars, chains, oil, grease you use. The gas cap does swell and cant be removed without a wrench and is scary to work with. I repair it constantly cut for 5-15 minutes and order parts. I have owned 6 poulan saws the last 3 were the pro models thinking they were better. The price always suckers me back in. So if you like to work endlessly and not get your job done this is the saw for you. I confess its my fault for buying the saw. I will have to stop typing now to order a new sproket, bar, chain, tightener. And lastly I am a home owner that uses it lightly."
3,poulan Pro saw,It's a good cutting saw but when you lay it sideways it wants to quit and you have to hold it straight and clear it out and then try again for a short side cut the fuel line I guess doesn't want to pick up when on it's side even with a full tank.
3,Gas Cap Problem,Starts promptly; runs well. I've only got small work with long periods between jobs. Only problem is the gas cap swells and is impossible to get off and back on. Customer Service said to place the saw in the sunshine for 2 hours.Bull!!! I can place the gas cap in the freezer then use channel lock pliers to replace and remove. So that means my jobs can only last 1 tank of gasoline. Then there's a long waiting period before resuming. Wait! I should just buy a couple of extra gas caps. Maybe Poulan should supply them when you buy a saw.
3,"Good chain saw, but hard to start","I just used the saw for the first time to cut up a small pine tree (10 to 11 inches in diameter). The saw worked fine, and I would give it an excellent rating except for one thing. It was hard to start and did not idle properly.There is a 6-step startup routine.1. Slowly press primer bulb 6 times.2. Pull choke out fully.3. Pull starter rope 5 pulls.4. Pull choke to half choke after engine tries to start.5. Pull rope until engine starts.6. Allow engine to warm for 30 seconds; then squeeze throttle to set normal idle.For the first 15 minutes of use, my saw did not idle. It just stalled out. So I had to repeat the startup routine many times. All those rope pulls are a good workout for an old guy like me. After 15 minutes, the saw did idle.Maybe this was just an issue of ""breaking in"" the saw, and it will start easier and idle better the next time I use it. If I had it to do over, though, I would look for a saw that was easier to start."
1,Refurbished.,This item was listed as a new product; however it was a refurbished product. The chain did not even fit the equipment. The product was returned for a full refund without any problem.
2,Recreational saw,Saw work well the only problem has been the chain tightener. It loosens up after a few cuts
4,Poulan Chain Saw,"Easy to start, vibration damping works well, easy to adjust chain tightening, only minor problem is flimsy choke that wouldn't stay choked."
5,Great little saw,"This is a great little saw. It cuts fast and is relatively quiet and vibration free. I live at 6500 feet, and I had to adjust the idle screw quite a bit to get the saw to idle, but after that it runs great. Tools free chain adjustment is awesome."
5,Saw works as advertised; great value for the money,"This chainsaw lives up to what I expected. Follow the priming instructions and it starts as advertised. I'm using it at an elevation of 8800 feet. With a sharp chain it cuts pretty well, but trying to rush the cut will bog down the engine. That's not surprising though as each 1000 foot of altitude decreases power by about 3%. I knew that going in and might have been better off with a larger engined saw, but the weight was a tradeoff. Main thing is I'm still happy with the saw after using it about every other weekend for three months clearing dead and downed trees on some mountain property. I should mention the anti-vibration mounting is quite good. There are some other Poulans (and other makes) that do not have this."
1,Worked great for five seconds,"Having used a Poulan Saw for the last 20 years I naturally chose a Poulan when I decided it was finally time to modernize. This saw started right up when I followed the instructions. When I went to rev it up to attack a tree it immediately stalled. Subsequent pulls on the rope were clearly not turning the crankshaft, there was no force and the flywheel just spun freely.The problem turned out to be a machined key that is part of the flywheel. It had completely disintegrated. I am not talking about the old style where the key was a separate square rod. This key is part of the flywheel casting. When I disassembled it the nut holding the flywheel to the crank was loose. I'm guessing it was shipped that way and this allowed the flywheel to move which is turn destroyed the key.Pretty shoddy design and manufacture but then what do you expect for this price?"
2,Save your money,"Buy a Husqvarna or Stihl. I've owned two Poulan Pro's and both were GREAT at the start. After using them a few times they failed to start and I always had issues with the chain coming off. It's probably fine for someone who cuts every once in a blue moon, but if you plan on having something that will last, DON'T BUY POULAN."
3,Just purchased my 5th,"I've been using the Poulan Pro PP3516AVX for 4 years now. It's ease of use has been good. I'm literally on my fifth saw. I've used it extensively to clear my 50 acres of cedar and downed oaks. The largest problem is I literally wear them out. Finding dealers to fix them has also been difficult, as Lowes puts you into contact with Poulan, Today I contacted Poulan and spoke to a lady with broncitis. The securing knob for the chain bar is plastic and the bar tightening piece is plastic as well. With repeated use they both give out. This can become dangerous as the chain will come off the bar if not secured tightly. To fix that piece it actually requires 7 pieces and the cost for that is $52.00. The entire chain saw only costs $128, so it's cheaper to buy a new one. Poulan should replace the plastic pieces with metal that is sturdier. The power of the saw is quite good for it's size. However eventually it too will dissipate, even with plug replacement. Over all I rate it a 3."
4,For my purpose this is an excellent saw,"I use this saw for clearing my property of the trees that were dropped to build out home. the biggest has been a red oak that was 18"" in diameter. Taking my time and letting the saw do the work it had no problems getting the job done.Several reviews complained about the saw being hard to start hot, or after prolonged (a few days) storage. I have had no problems hot starting the saw. I used the cold start instructions and once I figured out where the choke ""liked to be"" it was a breeze. As for after storing the saw, I handle it like any other gas appliance (Lawn mower, trimmer). Use good quality gas, proper oil mixture and if you plan on long storage use a quality fuel stabilizer. Even after two weeks of storage it fired right up."
3,"Bad carbuation settings, and loose chain brake","Fired right up, doesnt run smooth as when at different angles, the kick back chain brake is sloppy, kinda surprised at this, I will get the carb adjustment tools later, got my job done, and happy"
5,Ocarina of Time,"A must have for your Zelda collection, which is probably why you're looking for an original copy of such an old game. I am missing no game for my collection, but am missing some boxes and manuals, making me buy the game complete. This did not disappoint me at all. Yes, it will have creases and slight fading, but it's old and you're looking at $50, amazing quality for this, and amazing quality even until the $80 mark. The booklet is flawless and perfect and the cart makes me feel like I bought it when it just came out in 1998. If you even like Zelda a little, buy this game. 10/10 game and 10/10 provider."
2,Not the Collectors Edition,"The game arrived quickly and it works just fine. The only problem is, it's not the Collectors Edition. I wanted a working game first and foremost, so I'm not all that upset. However, I could have paid a little less for another listed game that was not labeled ""Collectors Edition""."
1,Style over substance.,"Like other reviewers, I was looking forward to trying recipes from this book. What a massive disappointment to find NONE!. Eye candy, yes. A big tease, for sure."
1,Pierre Gagnaire : Reflections from a Culinary Con-Artist,"I waited months for this book to be delivered. This book epotomizes the con game called fine dining; over priced self indulgent fluff with no substance. Like a restaurant of the same quality you may read through the book once if you can stomach it but you'll never want to go back. No one has to put pierre gagnaire on a pedastal, he gets on it himself."
5,I itch! I itch!,"Ah! Our Mr. Grinch seems to have an itch and can do nothing to relieve it. He tries and tries but to no avail, and true to form our Mr. Grinch becomes meaner and meaner. In this tale a little dog shows up and Mr. Grinch does everything in his power to show this little guy named Max that he does not want him around, that is until Max scratches the itch.This is an adorable book and fans of the Grinch will enjoy this adventure with him and the new addition of Max to his household. Could it be the Grinch does have a soft spot after all? Enjoy!Shirley Johnson"
4,The Grinch is great anytime of year.,"Children who are hooked on the Grinch will love this tale of how Max meets the Grinch by getting rid of his itch. As with the classic, children will witness the Grinch go from mean and grumpy to friendly and kind. The best part is that this book may be read all year round."
3,Fantastic show -- get the UK set,"Unfortunately I cannot paste in a link to another product in this review, so go to Amazon.co.uk and search for the Columbo DVD set for season 1 through 8. It's only 45 pounds (half the price of this set), and it comes in a much nicer case. You'll need to be able to play region 2 discs in your player.I expect Playback will soon release a set for seasons 1 through 9 and then 1 through 10 and so on. It will be good to have the full set, but to be honest, Columbo's glory days end with season 7. Season 8 is vastly inferior to the first seven seasons, and I expect the later seasons will be also. Though as much as I love Columbo, I'm sure I'll end up buying the complete set when it finally hits shelves sometime hopefully next year."
5,columbo series,this was on mom's christmas wish list. she's already seen them on tv years ago but now can watch anytime. she was so excited when she opened them. fast shipping!
1,Still Waiting!!!!,"My husband ordered this item from this seller in Novemeber of 2010. He knows that I am a big fan of the Columbo tv show and wanted to surprise me for Christmas. Long story short, after telling us it was in the mail this item was never received...they then told us that they were sending out a replacement order... still waiting... very disappointed in this company. Would not recommend dealing with them. Had to get a refund from Amazon in the end."
4,Blue Clear Sky,"""carried away"", ""she knows when your on my mind"", ""I can still make cheyenne"", and ""king of the mountain"" are the only really good songs on here, it's great, every country fan needs to own george strait his music is consistently WONDERFUL"
4,Good CD!,"While not what I consider the VERY best George Strait CD, it does have some mighty good cuts like the title cut, King of the Mountain and I just LOVE I Ain't Never Seen No One Like You. Keep up the great work, George!"
1,Highly not recommended,"Buy this only if you're working on a George Strait collection. ""It's listenable"" is the only nice thing I can say about it. I do like George Strait's music but this one is uninspired, unimaginative and boring."
3,A typical George Strait Album and Even a more Typical country album.,"Some pretty good tunes here including still make cheyenne, carried away, and I'd just as soon go. But, like every other country album, there are some hits and then the rest is crap. It is very hard to listen to any George Strait album all the way through. Anyway, this is a very typical Strait album with the basic steel guitar and boring guitar riffs. Also, his drummer does a fair job and is pretty aggressive for a country drummer. Strait rarely surprises you which is nice because you know what you're gonna get. As far as experimenting goes there is none. Harmonies are good and there are some high moments. I actually remember making out to a couple of these tunes in high school when this one came out. I do think though Strait does a good job of creating and perpetuating a very classic country sound."
1,Not Worth It!,"I bought this book because I thought there would be some information that was specific to Pionus to help in raising my new bird. Most of the information in this book is generic to all parrots which can either be found on the internet for FREE or in other parrot books for less than half the price. The print is larger than you would find in most books on top of duplicate information found throughout the book, which is an indication they were trying to increase the page count. I was extremely disappointed with this purchase and do not think this book is worth any more than $15. Buyer BEWARE!"
2,Amateurish,"Don't waste your money. Slim volume, full of repetition (often the exact same sentence is used in adjoining sections!). Even the photographs are repeated!Interesting, also, is the poor editing. Sentence fragments, mis-used words, non-existent words--the whole thing smacks of desperation to get enough words to make a book.There is nothing in this book you can't find, for free, on the web."
2,I would have been better off with an encyclopedia!,"I expected help on having these birds as pets. For $45, I only learned what I could have learned in any encyclopedia. Book was very boring and technical. Tiny too. There's SO much more a new pionus owner needs to know!"
3,Not as bad as others claim,"Okay, the writing is not the best. Is it a classic, no is it as bad as Kim Harrison or Katie Macallister no, but I could see the potential. I'm actually waiting for a book about the cousins. I think the publisher chose the wrong hero to start the series with."
2,....at Least it introduced Kian & Mordachi,"First off, there is Absolutely NO Making Love. I am a Grown Woman and I read all books, when I read a RoMANce book, I want a hot man pursuing a strong woman and then some making-of-the-love. There was very little pursuing. The Hero and Heroinne were together thoughout the story. Which is not bad, as long as there is some awesome snappy dialogue, tension and heart stopping encounters. There Were NONE of these. Niclas is okay. Sounds good looking and can fight. Julia is pretty but boring. There was no sexual tension or passion. There is only one sexually charge encounter which does not culminate into the deed. However, the cousin is hot, Kian, his book is next. And, the head of the family, Mordachi's book is after that. They had better be better and sexier."
1,Would that I could give it ZERO Stars,"I agree with the reviewer who referred to Touch of Night as ""Gag, Puke, Hurl"" and would have traded a day off of her/his life not to have read it. I really must say that those who rated this anything but trash, are obviously delusional. The writing style is substandard - teenage-ish, if you will. I laughed out loud at much of the dialogue. It just goes to show you that with minimal writing skills, you can get published. I think I should write a romance novel. I'll call it ""My Love For My Spleen"". It's sure to be more compelling than this book was."
4,Absolutely Loved It!,And can't wait to read more. I loved the fact that the characters were so straight forward about their feelings for each other as well as possessing a kindness that encompassed not only themselves but those around them. Quite refreshing indeed. I find myself quite weary sometimes when reading the back and forth struggles that usually accompany romance novels. I much prefer the romantic couple unite in order to fight any perils rather than have them constantly fighting the love that they naturally have for each other.
4,Not everyone enjoys the same books!,"I happend to enjoy this book and have been waiting for the next one. I enjoy a book that takes me away from everyday life, I enjoy Christine Feehan and also, Sherilynn Kenyon, Maggie Shane and this book in my oppinion is in that area."
3,Halloween: The Novelization,"I'm a huge fan of the movies and figured I'd read the accompanying novel. Well, it isn't bad and definitely worth reading if you're a fan of the series. The translation to paper must've been hard for writer Curtis Richards and it shows as at times, he seems kind of in the dark about certain plot aspects. The slight variations from the movie are almost irrelevant and only add to the story."
5,Total Pleasure Latex Alternative,"Ok folks - ever wonder why so many people HATE CONDOMS? Two potential reasons: latex and spermicide. For the extra sensitive lover in your life, check out Avanti. Not approved by FDA to prevent STDs only because the condom companies haven't paid to complete the regulatory hurdles, these condoms are a 100% complete fluid barrier (when used correctly) and they are non-allergenic. (BTW - If you want to keep your nonoxynol-9 but ditch the latex, you'll need Trojan Supra instead). A little odd at first because less stretchy than latex, polyurethane conducts bodyheat and is impervious to oil-based lubricants. Even if you think you aren't allergic, I'd give these a try (I didn't know I was until I tried something else). Thanks to Tom P for the heads up last year, I found a condom I can live with and better than that, love."
1,Poor compilation ...........................,"I bought it looking for the radio edit of ""Just The Two Of Us"" (the best version). But this has the original version where Grover's sax solo goes on a bit too long. There are many different edits of this song. Some cut out the middle solo, some fade various lengths off the end, and some do both. Any version running approximately 3:50 to 4:00 is the big radio hit. Avoid anything else.Apart from Roberta Flack, all the other tracks here are vastly inferior."
4,sms student,I recently read the book Chinese Handcuffs by Chris Crutcher. The book was pretty good. I could easily relate to it. It is about a boy (Dillon Hemingway) and that his brother killed himself right in front of him. Also it's about a girl (Jenn) who is one of the best basketball players in the state. But jenn also has some secrets that will blow you away. Dillion and Jenn both know each other. Dillon is a big part of her life as you'll find out throughout this book. This book is great for anybody who likes suspense. I hope you enjoy it.
4,My Opinion,"Chinese Handcuffs, written by Chris Crutcher, is a good novel for the young adult age group. It is written about two teenagers who have to suffer through life. The main character, is Dillon has to go through life after watching his brother commit suicide. The female character in the story is Jenn, who has to go through life without trying to tell people that her dad is abusing her. The novel is written in the way that a normal teenager would talk. Chris Crutcher knows what a teenagers emotions are and tries to express them in the kind of explicit language that some teenagers would use. I think the book is best for kids who are around the teenage years. I also think that some adults should read it to see what some kids go through. I rank this book a four because some of the details are very shady, and I did not like the ending of the story very well. On a final note, I would like to say that this book is pretty good and I would read it again if I ever get the chance to do it."
1,Low quality literature,"This is NOT a book for teens or anyone who likes good literature. The subjects treated on this book are for mature audiences, not 16 year-olds who are still developing emotionally. The ALA, librarians and teachers are pushing low quality literature and pornography to children--right under their parents' noses--instead of the Classics. Shame on teachers and librarians."
4,Touching Story,"Chinese Handcuffs, written by Chris Crutcher, is an overall excellent book. The novel contains sensitive issues, such as sexual abuse and suicide, which added a specific mood to the story. Mature readers would consider this book an ""easy read"", but I still find it to be well-written and truly inspiring. Almost the entire novel is about how the main characters cope with their personal situations, and the way they deal with their problems is amazingly impressive. The main reason I enjoyed reading this book is because it takes many unexpected turns that come as a shock. It is certainly not a story you would describe as predictable. Even though I loved the story, I found a few sections to be a little slow. Dillon's letters to Preston could have been shortened in order to keep the readers' interest. All in all, I would recommend this novel to mature readers."
3,Mediocre Book,"After reading this book I was a bit disappointed. The beginning of the book really caught my attention, and the author had me until the very end. It was not a good ending because it didn't provide the reader with closure. It just left me hanging, but not in a good way. I was wondering if the last few pages were missing, but they were not. Also, I was confused because the book kept switching narrators without any warning; so it was hard to tell sometimes who was talking.Other than that the book was good.There were some parts that were extremely inappropriate and sexual, which made me feel uncomfortable. This book is for a much more mature audience. The book dealt with trust, death, rape, and a lot of suffering. I would mainly suggest it for teens because it taught that you don't always know what is going on in other people's lives, and they may have it way worse then you. So, you shouldn't be so judgmental. Overall Chinese Handcuffs was a mediocre book."
4,Read this book!,"I often struggle to get students to read, yet it's difficult to offer ideas to kids sometimes. Chinese Handcuffs is ALWAYS a hit with my high school students, boys and girls alike. They relate to their characters, their conflicts, and the dialogue and structure of the novel. I highly recommend this novel for anyone not afraid of challenging subject matter."
4,The Cristina's New Chairs,"We were very pleased with our purchase, however, having spent much time putting the chairs together, it was discovered that one of the chairs had a dent and paint loss on the wooden back of the chair! Rather than going through the trouble of dismantling this chair and shipping it back, we opted to touch up the damage with black paint! Other than that one issue, we love them!"
2,Looks cheap,"I only paid $20.00 for this lamp. The globe is plastic. It is not tiffany glass. It is plastic faux tiffany glass. I use it for reading, but would not recommend it or purchase again."
5,This book made me buy my fitness center!,"All I can say: a fantastic book. After having read it and studied it thoroughly, I feel confident that I will be successfull in running my new gym. I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone who is in the fitness industry: it will give you a fresh view on how things are done."
5,Beautiful Music,"Two long time friends together, reminiscing and playing absolutely beautiful blues and ballads. If ""New Orleans Blues"" or ""Stormy Weather"" don't bring a tear to your eye, then you need to check with a doctor to see if you are still alive. Why the Amazon sales rank on this CD is so low is beyond my comprehension. Wonderful recording quality. These recordings along with the other in this series are among Lonnie Johnson and Elmer Snowden's finest --amazing since both are considered to have peaked performance wise in the late 20s/early 30s."
1,Do Not order from this Company,"Coriandre By Jean Couturier For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Oz.I can not say anything about the product as it was never delivered, when I contacted the company they literally said that I had no options. That they had sent, they believed it was delivered, and if you did not get it then too bad! Go Figure, what manner of company is this that Amazon has doing business on its' website. I will never order from this Company, and am having second thoughts about Amazon as well. Do yourself a favor if Tuccini is the company listed do not order from them as they will not honor your business. Be advised-and be warned!"
1,Coriandre,"I was very disappointed in this product. I have had Coriandre in the past (not recently) and I received many compliments. When I got this recent shipment,I felt like it had been watered down. I could not tell that I had it on. I will not order anymore."
5,Coriandre Eau de Toilette - spray cologne,"Have loved this product for years -- every time I wear it, I get very positive comments on it -- noticeable yet not overpowering."
3,Interesting Movie,"I thought ""Class of 1984"" was good for it's time. It was like a documentary movie, and a really violent movie into one. One good thing about this movie. Is the fact it has Micheal J. Fox in the movie."
2,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS LAUNCH DATE?????????,IVE BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS FOR THIS TO COME OUT AND IT CHANGED ITS DATE TWICE SO FAR. NOW IM BEING TOLD ITS NOT COMING OUT TILL NEXT YEAR MAN THATS AWFULL WHATS GOING ON .??????????????
1,Junk,Couldn't handle more than 10 minutes of this violent junk. Let's teach the kids about love and peace instead of how to bully and hurt each other.
5,wow,its exactly what my daughter wanted funny thing is i graduated in 85 so my daughter liked seeing what it was in the for me
3,nice but no wheels,this item is very nice. the color was not correct nor did it come come with wheels. but hey it looks nice
5,Better than I expected,"I ordered this tea cart because it was a good deal but sometimes looks are deceiving. That was not the case here. This cart was solid, easy to put together and actually looked better than the picture. I love it!!"
1,Bleh,"I got this for my mother's bday as decoration for her yard to place plants on. However, I was disappointed that this item came poorly packaged. A wheel was broken off which totally makes it useless. I have since returned it back to Amazon. I am now waiting for my credit. :("
2,Quality Control Issues with this Brand,"I too received my cart in a damaged box and 3 of the 4 wheels were broken. ALso, mine was brown now black as pictured. I was told by Amazon that I could contact the company directly to get replacement wheels although no contact information was included in the box and Amazon does not keep a record of it either. Amazon was very good to try to rectify my situation since the contact information was unavailable. I think this could still be used as a plant stand without wheels but still disappointing when I look at. This seems to be an issue of quality control in general with this brand. If you read reviews for their other products there seems to be a trend of cheaply made items."
2,Where are the wheels?,The wheels arrived in pieces. Please send four replacements.Thank you.Janet M. Suciu717-236-0943
3,broken but still pleased,cart came with all 4 wheels broken. but it only cost $19 and still looks very cute covered with plants. light enough to move around without needing wheels
5,"Finest kind of novel, kinda magnificent if you want to know","Well, shoot, I first read this novel 20 years ago and I fell for it as if I were a termite eaten trunk of any sort that stood in those piney woods. Finest kind, boy howdy. This novel is special, well, yes. It's special alright. But it's a whole lot more than that. This novel is not just a good read but uniquely so. So, get to it!"
2,Snow Bored,"A pretty irresistible set-up gets swiftly bogged down in this Cold War era thriller. The table's set with some atmospheric cloak and dagger espionage, even if our heroes are a little too true-blue and stalwart to be very compelling. (Indeed, in one bitter aside the author seems to take a shot at Deighton and LeCarre for not being patriotic enough in their depiction of Britain's security services.) The pay-off should be this team's McLean-ean spiriting of a KGB defector on a night train through snowbound Europe -- and some of this is good. However, the reader quickly ends up taxing themselves trying to keep straight the ceaseless parade of would-be assassins bent on thwarting the mission.The book's okay, but doesn't stand the test of time, beyond a few thrills and serving as an example of the back-bench spy novelists of the period."
1,Broken!,"I am really upset, we ordered this toy for our son's Christmas present and it came broken and we don't know if we can return it cause we bought it over 30 days ago, but of course we didn't know it was broken until we opened it for Christmas. We ordered two and the other one isn't working either. I AM VERY UPSET! Nothing like your son's only 2 Christmas presents not working."
1,Agate hounds Bible,Each edition is better than the one before it. Cool pictures of some extremely cool agates.Well written stories.
1,September 12: We knew everything would be all right,"The book is inappropriate for young children who cannot grasp the concept of terrorism. I would not give it to a child younger than nine or ten. It is true that vocabulary is simple enough, bu the subject is too complex for five-year-olds."
5,Perfect for what my daughter needed,My daughter was not alive when our world changed forever. She is merely a 1st grader now and this year she learned about 9/11. She came home crying about the events that took place and was scared for her grandparents who live in New Jersey. Even 10 years later 9/11 is heartbreaking. This book allowed me to ease her fears in a more gentle way. It showed her all the things that were still normal after that day. The fact that it was written by first graders really helped bring things down to her level.
1,Teaching self-centeredness,"It is my sincere hope that no one will read this book to their child or to their class since it is such an affront to the idea of America as one country. I am glad that those children were safe on September 12, but in reality, in New York, people were still looking for their loved ones, rubble was still smoldering and many families had not even begun to know how to continue. The lesson of ""because it didn't happen to me the world is okay"" is not the lesson I want my child to learn. Would the publisher even dream of selling a post-Katrina book called ""August 31 - Our House Didn't Get Flooded So We Knew We Would Be All Right""? Of course not."
4,Couldn't Put Down,"I've read all of Emily Barr's novels and this is up there with her debut Backpack. I had trouble putting it down to carry on with my day to day stuff. From the first paragraph I was hooked. If I didn't have to do anything, I'd be finished in a day. Once again Barr writes a complex, three dimensional lead character. Its very realistic to witness Evie's evolution into a better person. The pacing is perfect with the revealing of Evie's secret and the reader gets the chance to really get to know the characters. My only problem with the book was the stuff with Louise. That seemed to me, just a bit out there, a little over the top, but then again something like that was bound to happen. This is a very good read and I eagarly await Barr's next novel."
2,Sorry to disapoint anyone.,"This sounds like Marty has ran out of ideas, so he tries to be funny. Actually I love Marty, but he needs to try something new. I know how much he loves traditional country, so do I, but where is HIS voice here? Trust me, go out and get ""Hillbilly Rock,"" ""Tempted"" and ""This One's Gonna Hurt You,"" and just let this one die quietly."
3,If only it were more durable.........,"I LOVE this mop. I've had 4 of them now... in the last year and a half. I do not care for the whole ""disposable"" idea, though, and cheat by attaching regular washcloths to this. It works great. I'm also too cheap to buy their refill cleaning solution, so I buy the solution of my choice, and place it in the bottle that comes with the mop.Mopping no longer requires bending over to scrub or a big, nasty bucket of water. Attach the washcloth, pull the trigger to squirt and gently wash the dirt away.Now, the durability... I'm really not rough with my mop and I'm far from one of those people who mop every day. I've had the handle, the squirter AND the mop pad assembly all break on me. Clorox has been good about always replacing it or refunding it, but after 4 months, the search has begun for something more durable."
2,I don't think it's so great,"I have tile floors in the kitchen and bath. The mop works pretty good when the pad is new, which is about 30 seconds. As soon as the pad is wet with the cleaning solution the problems begin. The sides get too wet and the middle of the pad doesn't really touch the floor unless you use a lot of pressure. Then you will hear scraping sounds. You can not scrub anything off the floor with these pads or pick up crumbs. It is ok for a quick wipe up. If you have a larger floor stick to the traditional sponge mop and bucket."
1,Not Worth The Money,Usually I like to wait at least a month before I review a product. This doesn't warrant the wait. The price is good and that's the only reason I gave it 1 star. That and the fact that there is no zero star rating. Less than $40 for 4 of these averages about $9.75 for the starter kit. I thought great. I would eventually have to buy more solution and pads which would end up costing me more in the long run. When you press the spray trigger it doesn't cover a large area and depending on how you have the spray head angled it can end up going on your lower cabinets and walls instead of the floor. Doesn't clean that well and even when applying pressure some of the dirt just stayed on the floor. I previously had a Swiffer Wet Jet. It worked much better. Maybe I'll just sell the other 3 units and try to recoup some of my money back. Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this product. If you need a product like this go with the Swiffer.
1,Don't bother,"its a pad that just pushes dust bunnies and fur from pet and other debris around. Pads are not made to pick up anything so you end up with lumps of mess that you need to bend over and get.....and don't even try to get a stubborn spot up.....and it does get into corners but if the corner is not right on top of you and you push and push it just leaves the mess so just bend over and scrub with whatever you usually use.......not good for the environment, not good for the floor, only good to toss out and go to a better system."
4,Clean Kitchen & Bathroom Floors,Clean floors without a bucket. Clean floors without getting down on hand and knees. The mopping system has the cleaning fluid riding on the mop handle. There is a trigger at the top of the mop handle so that as you mop you can apply fluid to the floor whenever needed.
5,A Book That Should Never Be Out Of Print,The guitar instruction is for advanced guitar players and the interview is for advanced poeple. The CD is for everyone.
1,Too big,"It's a good slide, but I prefer the Medium size. It fits perfectly on my little finger which is the finger I wear it on. Amazon doesn't carry the Medium size, so I got one from Music 123 (they carry all of the sizes). I also tried the small one , but that was too small.I love the clay interior, it's very comfortable. And the glaze on the outside produces very warm, buttery tones."
3,A Sad Tale,Good reading for those who appreciate matters of a trivial life. Great resourcing on a subject who is hard to pin down in any one source.
2,Don't waste your time or money,"Unless you've heard this band and fallen in love with their style, there is no reason for you to buy this. It sounds just like so many other bands, but so much worse. I'll say it again, Don't bother."
2,Anemic Teal,"Unfortunately, this is not forest green. It's a dusty, washed out, unimpressive teal. I had to get rit dye remover to ""undo"" the damage. Normally Jacaquard colors are pretty accurate and rich. This was awful."
3,Medical ID Bracelet,"Although it serves its purpose, I wish that the bracelet was slightly larger. It's just a tad too tight"
1,Method Doesn`t Work,"There`s a lot of good information in general about internet gambling. I read the book over several times, hoping to be able to make a living at it. Putting it in practice, playing for fun as Ford recommends, didn`t make me money in numerous practice games. My results were nothing like Ford claims he got, and in fact I was losing money consistently."
2,Outdated Material,"The concept behind this book is to visit as many internet casinos as you can collecting the sign-up promotional cash bonuses along the way. As the online casinos require that you bet some multiple of the bonus or your initial deposit in order to actually withdraw the bonus, the book recommends a conservative roulette or craps strategy. The problem lies in that most online casinos do not allow you to wager on craps or roulette in order to fulfill the terms of the bonus, thus requiring you play higher risk games. In conculsion, this is a pretty good ... book with some useful casino lists and gambling links, but I'm still not sure what makes this a ... book."
5,Give Back To Oneself & To The Church,"Giving 10% of one's income to the church can be a really big and troubling step for some, but how about giving back to oneself. Read this book learn why to give and how to give to save for the future with the word of God. Remember a fool and his money are soon parted."
