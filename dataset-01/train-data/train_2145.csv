3,"Good, but...","First, he is a good musician, and writes haunting, poignant lyrics. When he sings about the futilities & uncertainties of life, I can get into it, and remember what it was like to be his age. The music lacks polish, but the album does show that a promising young talent is emerging.However, towards the end of the album he stopped singing about personal issues and launches into an uninformed whiny rant on Iraq. He spends the 1st half of the album telling us how the world is so complicated that he can't understand it, then he proves his ignorance on the last few tracks. If you can stomach his politics, go ahead, try Bright Eyes. I, on the other hand, was completely turned off.Hey Connor, put the granola bar down and grow up."
1,Umm....yeah,"Umm, yeah, Bright Eyes sucks....and Conor Oberst can't sing worth crap! I mean, it's just horrible people. Conor seriuosly sounds like a little 4 year old toddler crying because he fell off of his little baby bike and banged his knee. And don't even get me started on the less-than-mediocre guitar playing....Wow, music today is getting pretty bad, don't think? And to think of all the ignorant, immature, simple-minded, whiny little imbeciles who listen to this music! I mean I remember the days when music was good, like when guitarist Jimmy Hendrix, or guitarist Dimebag Darrel was still alive, but yet people who have bad taste in music don't want to listen to music that actually requires alittle bit of something called TALENT to play...I mean this type of music really makes you wonder...I was left with such an anger towards it....good gosh, good music has gone out the window."
1,"Nothing but Pretentious, Over Ambitious Nonsense","Everywhere I turn I see Conor Oberst's face these days. Spin, Rolling Stone, everywhere. Everybody seems to be infatuated with this ""rock and roll genius"". I've tried multiple times to listen to this guy drone on and on about how awful the government is, and how much life sucks, but I just can't get into it. He is completely untalented, completely uninteresting, and completely overrated. His music is nothing groundbreaking, nothing earth shattering, and he sure as anything ain't no ""rock and roll genius."" He is a whiny little kid with an acoustic guitar and a big head. if you want to hear good songwriting listen to Yes, listen to Cash, listen to Coldplay even. I'm not much of a Coldplay fan myself, but they beat the living crap out of Conor Oberst. He is nothing but smoke and mirrors, and he is duping America. Wake up, because its morning."
2,has nobody heard of David Gray or Badly Drawn Boy?,"apparently not. This will have to do it for the philistines, then."
3,Bright Eyes Disappoints,"Thanks to my daughters and students I've heard quite a bit of Bright Eyes, but this album seemed flimsy and lacked depth."
1,Ugh.,"A lot of people have been hyping Bright Eyes as 'the new Bob Dylan.' That could be true, becuase his voice is just as annoying as Bob's. This is really dumb music for high school girls who take poetry classes. Don't bother."
1,Yecccchhhhh!,"If you like self-important garbage with a simplistic, childish view of the world, this is the cd for you.I would have given it zero stars if I could have.He can't even sing!"
1,This Is Sh*t,"If you're looking for a good album by the ""band"" Bright Eyes, forget it! None exist. This kid must have some good friends in very high places to be showered with all the praise he gets. If you want to hear something good called ""Bright Eyes"", I suggest you watch the movie Watership Down or listen to Art Garfunkel."
5,one of my top five albums of all time,"quirky, and perfect.there isn't a track i don't likecrass, a bit bitter, a little drunk.... this album captures the soul of a young man like no other record i have ever heard. this is his document of what it means to move into lower manhattan. this is how it is for him. this is how he sees the world: he questions, he listens, and he looks. (it is called literature)i am not yet tired of this record, it is full-bodied. it is honest. it is part of my own story as well, only with better background music."
4,Great Acoustic Album,"Great album. Heartful, passionate lyrics with a nice folk-rock acoustic backing. The songs are very melodic and complex. Anyone who likes acoustic rock/folk-rock/alternative/indie music will really dig this one. Best tunes: First Day of My Life, Road to Joy."
5,Conor at his creative best!,"What else can you say. I will not go on and on as its not even necessary. Simply put, Bright Eyes releases two new cds, so buy them. I ordered mine through the Saddle-Creek Xmas special and have them for about two weeks. I know today is the official release date, so here's a big congratulations to them for releasing what are sure to be the BEST two cds all year.These are 10 of the best Bright Eyes songs I've ever heard!www.LosAngelesPop.com"
3,Emo Schmemo,"There IS something whiny about this guy's voice and take on life, but having said that, this really is his best disc yet...he's taken the songwriting up a notch, and looks as though he's slowly angling towards taking in wider array of subjects (things not having to do with himself) sometime in the near future...Landlocked Blues and Lua are particularly nice...Points for having Emmylou on the disc - that NEVER hurts...."
4,Bright Eyes,"This Album is truly great. obviously, though, it's not going to be everyones cup of tea. It is minimalist and soulful. I guarantee you right now many young people lack the maturity and patience to delve into this album. but for those who do, it is a sweet reward. I recomend Bright Eyes to anyone who appreciates good music with real emotion. hahaha some kid says listen to Pantera and not this. ahh, how can metal music suck so much?oh and by young people I mean ages 8-13 or so. I'm 17, so it would be hypocritical of me to mean teenagers."
2,Too much effort for too little talent,"As an album that will either put you to sleep or evoke that sickening nausea that comes from hearing self-absorbed songs drenched in buttery meaning with no true depth, this works great. But Dylan this most definitely is not. Maybe it was everybody else raving about how great this cd was, but I could not even finish listening to the entire album. This is one artist I can definitely do without.If you want true angst, check out Elliot Smith; for great intimate songs, try Kings of Convenience."
1,"More fuel for the ""nerd rock"" fire.","If I have to hear one more quavery voice imparting street corner, folksy philosophy to the masses (The Decemberists, I'm looking at YOU), I'm going to scream.Elliott Smith, one of my favorite musicians, is guilty of one major crime - spawning legions of these sensitive, emoting ingenues who are unfortunately lifted to popularity by indie music snobs who are desperate to ride the wave of New. The fact that Emmylou Harris accompanies our plucky hero on this effort seals the deal - here is packaged and marketed ""alternative"" mainstream at its finest. A thoroughly so-so genre rock production targeted at those that find such wishy-washy music rewarding. Just because it is a success with that target market does not make the album good.If Alan Alda were a twenty-something faux indie kid with delusions of significance (read Magnet's interview with Conor in issue #65 - ""horrible music and no diversity at all"", indeed!) this is what he would sound like."
1,Conor Oberst Can't Sing,"I bought this CD based on all the glowing reviews it received here on Amazon. If you're thinking about buying this CD, please listed to the preview first. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it. I must say, this CD really blows, and Conor Oberst couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. It's really funny, too, how all the negative reviews on Amazon are deemed not helpful,even when they are right on the money. When people are determined to throw their money away, they don't want to hear any dissenting opinions. Believe me:this CD is garbage, and Conor Oberst is all hype."
5,This is the sound,"If Bright Eyes sticks to the folk sound on this album, he will easily become our generation's Johnny Cash."
2,Avoid this disk!,"I'm not sure who is actually writing the reviews for this musician, but they must be on the publicity payroll. If you're thinking of buying this disk DO NOT. The reviews are all hype. The music is downright maudlin and repetitive country and blues music. Nothing wrong with country or blues music per se. His voice is grating to the ear. The first two songs are OK, but then the disk takes a serious nosedive and never recovers. Just my opinion."
1,Could this SUCK any harder???,"I've never heard more depressing, monotone, totally self-indulgent crap in my life. You'd have to PAY ME to listen to this drivel."
3,It's just music..............,"Music is music...there is a plethera of orignal bands out there, some way more than connor oberst. The music on these two simultaneously released records is pretty good.....but as far as being compared to Bob Dylan, how is that even possible. Bob Dylan arrived in an era where the United States was being torn apart by war and segregation. He was partly responsible for getting these issues recognized and dealt with. He is a true musical hero. Now we have a new kid from the 21st century making his own music, from Texas nontheless. There is no comparison here .This is just music like som many other original bands like Grand Theft Bus and Bear vs Shark.. Check them out...Peace"
1,"No comparison to other great songwriters, ie Ryan Adams","I bought both of these albums after all of the hype surrounding them and I am thoroughly disappointed with both efforts. He continuously sounds off key, his song structure is an unpleasant listening experience and he is overly hyped as a new Dylan when in fact, he doesn't even compare to Ryan Adams or other great, young musicians in this category. Pick up any Ryan Adams cd (or Whiskeytown) and you'll know what I mean, just no comparison. Both of these cd's weren't worth my money or time."
1,Good if you are angsty ;),"If I could make a CD called anthems of todays teenagers or a cd called Livejournal music,this would be on it-Horrible singing,horrible creative ability. So if you're a fan of poorly produce indy rock this is the thing for you!So put on your eyeliner put your hair in one of those horrid scene hair cuts and get to listening the revolution of horrible music is here to stay!"
5,Amazing!,"Conor Oberst and the rest of Bright Eyes are literally amazing. ""We Are Nowhere And It's Now"" is a song that just sticks with you. The quietness of this recording makes it much easier to listen to than most other alternative music out right now and for good reason. Conor has a gift and it definitely shows. When I first downloaded ""Lua"" from this website I was instantly hooked and went out and bought the cd asap. To anyone who says that this and other Bright Eyes recordings are crap-you must be kidding yourself to prove a point or just plain lying."
3,"I'm bored, it's noonish","Like Ryan Adams, this guy needs a haircut and an editor -- and not necessarily in that order. As usual, IWAIM has a handful of impressive tunes -- and the odd brilliant couplet or two -- but someone needs to reign this Connor kid in a bit and enroll him in the ""Less is More"" school of songwriting. Otherwise, he tends to ramble. And ramble. And what's with Emmylou Harris? I've never heard her sound so extraneous, or more lost (""Landlocked Blues""). Above average, but just."
5,Conor Oberst = Next great American songwriter,"Let me start out by saying that before I heard this album, the only Bright Eyes songs I knew were ""Bowl of Oranges"" and ""Let's Not Sh*t Ourselves."" Both good songs, but as I came to learn, not nearly their greatest work. Upon putting this masterpiece in my cd player, I was drawn to the voice of Conor Oberst like a moth to a flame. I wanted to hear his stories, and I realized that the music of Bright Eyes is far more uplifting and hopeful than most people think. The music is full of love, full of energy, and full of SOUL. Please, for goodness' sake, do not call this emo. Call it brilliance, and American music at its very best."
4,Good Album,"I don't know what that guy Sweet Cheeks ""watty420"" (The Seas O' Cheese) is talking about but i think this is a really good album. And no i didnt see it on MTV so i dont know WTF he is talking about, this guy has the nerve to rag on this band and discusses its ties to MTV yet praises MTV bands like Korn and AFI which in my opinion eats large chode. In my opinion this music is very relaxing and soothing to the ears, which works better than a headache with AFI everytime. Get the Album. its good. Digital Ash is also Good."
5,Great album,"This is a great album, and is worth buying. This is in no way emo, and anyone who says it is has no clue what emo actually is. Bands such as Indian Summer, Saetia, Orchid, Neil Perry, and Rites of Spring are emo bands, and Bright Eyes sounds absolutely nothing like that at all."
5,Good CD,"When picking from the two albums I picked the more acoustic one over the digital one. I'm glad this is one of the best cds I heard in a long time. Conor Oberst is a great songwriter and these acoustic gems are worthwhile. With alot of country influences throughout the record, Oberst has the legendary Emmylou Harris appearing on three beautiful track. His voice might need some getting used to, but it sounds kind of sorrowful and his lyrics are rich and wonderful. Favorites include At The Bottom Of Everything, We Are Nowhere And It's Now (with Emmylou Harris), Old Soul Song (For The New World Order), Lua, First Day Of My Life, Landlocked Blues (with Emmylou Harris), and Poison Oak. Highly Recommended."
3,has some amazing songs,"i'm a totally new bright eyes fan, read good reviews of the album so i got it and since then iv heard some of his older stuff. i absolutely love some of his songs, and i'm always touched by 'first day of my life' and 'we are nowhere and its now', but some of the others just leave me cold. as i said, i spose i'm not a 'true' bright eyes fan so you can ignore this if you want but if you're a newcomer as well i'd say get the album or at least do something to hear those two songs because they're quite something."
1,Horrible!!,"Am I not the only person who finds this one of the absolute worst albums that I have ever heard. On top of the fact that he can't sing, the entire album sounds like something put together in a tree house, yet they are selling it for $10! How do ""deep"" lyrics warrant classifying terrible singing and songs as amazing?"
3,Shows promise but not there yet,A few steps below Ryan Adams' at his best. Miles below Gram Parsons and Dylan at the top of their game.
2,He might as well kill himself already,"Really. I mean, this album just makes me want to take my pants off and shave my wolverine that prowls in the darkness"
2,He sings like a sheep: BAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! BAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!,"My take: Well, for one thing I thought the track ""When the president talks to god..."" was cool, but it isn't found here. As for the rest? It's the kind of stuff you hear from an aspiring guy sitting on a stool at a coffeehouse at night, trying hard to command attention. I am not impressed with these tracks. You know you're in for a pretentious trip upon (taking sip) listening to the opening (take sip, make sure microphone picks it up clearly). He sings, or rather bleats, like a sheep on every song. It's an ok vocal tic, but he overdoes it and it irritates. It's too emotional. Young guys looking to impress innocent naifs with their ""sensitivity"" will likely try to prove it by having this on. CO has potential, but this album is definitely overrated."
1,No Usfull Information on How to Operate a B&B,"I just finished watching this video, Innkeeping: the Innside Story. I was disappointed that it did not go into any detail on how to run an Inn. I was ready with notepad in hand to crib information on taking reservations, dealing with difficult guests, best accounting software to use, staff hiring pactices, etc. There was precious little substance and I came away with no notes.The video mentioned that going to the PAII Association web site would be where I could find the information I needed. The back of the video states that it contains the ""resources that will increase your chances of success"". I have yet to trip over a single resource other than the PAII web address that keeps all the pertinent information hidden away for members only.On the technical side, it is an amature production with poor lighting, muffled sound and grade school graphics."
5,Pure poetry,"Andrew Hill is inspired to create pure poetry. Shades is the best of his 80s output. The second track, ""Tripping"", is worth the entire price. Think of the other numbers as bonuses."
3,Great For Beginners,"As a Pro Trainer I am always pleased to come across books geared toward beginners - as they are the segment of the population in need of the most help.Simple, basic & time sensitive - the fitness newcomer will have no excuses for not doing this workout.Joey Atlas - The Wizard of Fitnesswww.AbsOfStoneCoreOfSteel.comwww.ButtHipAndThighMakeover.com"
3,"Buy ""Greatest Hits"" As Opposed To This","Yes, for a budget price, this does include many of Expose's top 10 hits including ""Seasons Change"", ""When I Looked At Him"", ""Tell Me Why"", ""Point of No Return"" and ""I'll Never Get Over You."" However, this collection ignores two of Expose's biggest hits which are ""What You Don't Know"" and ""Come Go With Me."" I would recommend their official ""Greatest Hits"" over this, but one bonus to this album are the inclusions of the top 20 hit ""I Wish the Phone Would Ring"" and the adult contemporary hit ""As Long As I Can Dream"" which are left out on the ""Greatest Hits."""
1,The All New Good Housekeeping Cookbook,"I was shocked when I received this book. It was copywrited in the 1950's and yes - was the All New Good Housekeeping Cookbook at that time, but not the one I ordered. It was wrapped improperly and so was gravely damaged in transit. The pages were very yellow, had separate notes from the previous owner on little pieces of paper. I did request my money back and I am not sure the seller understood why. I felt it was a fraud."
5,THE ALL NEW GOOD HOUSEKEEPING COOK BOOK,HAD THE OLD ONE AND LIKED ITWOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERSTHIS IS REALLY MAKING ME MAD NOW. WRITING EXTRA WORDS
5,The only cookbook I use,"My husband got this cookbook for free when he bought a comforter. I laughed when I saw it. That was ten years ago. It is now pretty much the only cookbook I use and nearly every recipe has turned out wonderfully. I am now ""known"" for ""my"" (Northern Style) lasagna and Spice Cake - all thanks to this book. I would recommend it to anyone, although it is especially useful to people just moving out on their own and wanting ""all the basic recipes"" and then some. Buy it!!"
3,not at her best,"This is a good live by Diane Schuur, but I think this is not one of her best performances to date; I've seen her twice in Italy in concert, and both these performances were much better.The best thing to appreciate Diane Schuur live is to SEE her live, not to HEAR her live on record."
2,linzer cookie cutter,I received this cookie cutter to use to make Christmas cookies. After making 2 cutouts with the cookie cutter it broke. It is not made well and should not break so easily.
4,Nice cutter set,"Good product and great for cookie making. My only shortfall is that at times the cut dough gets ""stuck"" in the cutter. Then the process slows down."
2,Doesn't perform as advertised,"Last Christmas I decided to add these cutters to my (vast) cookie cutter collection. First, the pros: The large cutter is a nice size, makes pretty cookies, and has an easy release. However, I had problems with the inner cutters. Maybe mine is defective, but they don't cut all the way through the cookie. My inner cutouts end up looking raggedy. They are also difficult to use because the cookie dough gets stuck inside the cutters and I have to dig it out with a butter knife. Plus they're difficult to keep clean as the dough gets caught in the cracks.What I've been doing is cutting out the main cookie, then using the smaller cutters separately. It's tricky because I don't always get it lined up right and if I'm too close to the edge the cookie might break.I really do like the large cutter and the plunger works well. I've been using it to make homemade Oreos if nothing else. I'm still going to buy a new set, though."
2,what I really want is...,"The songs from Alias...buying those CD's individually would cost hundreds and even downloading them one by one gets pricey.The soundtrack's nice, but I want the -songs-!"
5,Hear what u see,while listenin to this album in every track i feel like i can feel the energy and danger
2,Over Price,"This CD is highly over priced. I enjoy the music, but some of the songs are 1 to 2 minutes long. It is not worth 15.00."
4,Star Trek Voyager Mosaic,"How wonderful to listen to the voice of Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) as she guides the listener through the events that created the enigma that is Janeway. The story begins somewhere in season two of Voyagers quest to return home from the delta quadrant and then leaps backward in time to provide insight and great back story into Janeways life. For Voyager fans, this is a must hear / read experience, it explains why Janeway acts and reacts the way she does, her isolation, her loneliness and her almost maniacal desire to save her crew, begin to make sense. Jeri Taylor wrote it with recommendations from Kate Mulgrew so its authority is beyond reproach. This book delivers a completely believable and moving story which, when read by Kate, at times had me misty eyed. Great stuff."
5,Kate Mulgrew's reading of Mosaic brought Cp Janeway to life.,Jeri Taylor filled in the gaps of why Capt. Janeway is one of Starfleet's best. Her battles and triumphs and her lost love. Kate Mulgrew's reading brought the images to life and the story of her character to a new understanding. Great book.
3,Why Celery?,"Read this book for the first short story: Why commando raids to obtain small amounts of a plant? Treecats give new meanings to the words: telepath, spy, caution. This even explains why treecats can be sentient, but never bothered to come down from the 'trees.'David Drake didn't bother to read any of the HH stories before mailing his garbage in. Read any WW1 'white man's burden' story instead, you'll feel better. (Drake's idea of making the Manties look good is to insult them less than his other characters.) He offers an excuse at the end: Parts of the story actually happened in Egypt long ago. I guess this makes it God's fault?S.M. Stirling did read the books, an excellent emulation. He manages to make the PRH leadership into worthwhile people, with courage, strenght and problems.. After all, Honor needs 'great' enemies to overcome..The last part is by Weber again, and is a condensed history. Some rehash of the HH appendixes, but much is new: How the Solarian league and Haven came to be."
3,Filler for Honor Fans!,"Honor Harrington fans who are biting their nails in anticipation of the next volume (Echoes of Honor, Baen, 10/98) can salve their spirits with some filler. Read the first chapter for an explanation of treecat psychology and human-cat interaction."
3,History of universe,"This is a prequel that talks about the founding of and several key historical events in the Honor universe that only worked, in the sense I didn't give it two stars. Which I really want to do, because while engaging and ""cute"" the main story dragged on too long for what it was. It should have been further fleshed out and longer, or cut short and left as a stand alone. The other two stories were a rehash of true Earth history (moving the events to another planet and rather than being about ships of the line, being about space ships) and pointless tale about a failed/successful revolution/conspiracy thing that was too convoluted for the thirty or forty pages it occupied."
3,The title is the key; there is more in Manticore than Honor!,"The books contains three short stories. The first, by David Weber himself, provides an excellent 'first contact' story about the Sphinxan treecats. This is a good stand-alone story with a juvenile protagonist. It is somewhat reminiscent of the ""Little Fuzzy"" sequels NOT written by H. Beam Piper. The second story, by David Drake, is good space opera. The third, by S. M. Stirling, fills in a gap in a previous Honor narrative (Honor herself is not mentioned). OK, if you like Sterling."
3,Background info & sub-plots on Honor,"I was looking forward to the next book on Honor Harrington. What I found was some good information in two of the three stories, and the section of background information was good - up to a point. This book DOES NOT deal with what is going on with Honor at all."
2,Not the next book in the series!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is not the sequel to ""In Enemy Hands"". This is merely three authors dsiplaying their writing styles in the Honor Harrington universe. While the stories are not bad, this is not what is expected of an Honor Harrington book. I do not suggest this book as a reader of Honor Harrington novels."
3,"It was ok but, .....","It was overall an ok book but, I wasn't exactly engrossed by it like earlier Harrington novels."
4,"More Than Honor, a fan's perspective","First off, this book is an invitation to share in the universe of Honor Stephanie Harrington. No more, no less.The first story is background, the beginning of the relationship between men and treecats.The second story is David Drake being funny again. (See his `All The Way To The Gallows' to see him REALLY being funny.)Steve Stirling's `A Whiff Of Grapeshot' is truly significant background, because it gives an insight into the character of Esther McQueen and how she was able to accomplish her victories in `Echoes Of Honor.' In `Flag In Exile' and `Honor Among Enemies', she was just a name. `A Whiff Of Grapeshot' made her a person."
4,noble fool,"This is some highly enjoyable work from the ebullient hands of Byard. It's a simple piano trio album to be sure, but the writing and pacing take the session out of the ordinary. The songs by the leader are the big attraction, though bassist Ralph Hamperian's ""Breath"" is equally captivating. This one is for straightheads who can handle a bit of panache a la Ahmad Jamal, Hampton Hawes or Art Tatum in the afterlife."
1,"I'm a Lara fan, but this book doesn't do much for me.","This book is mostly fluff, little substance. It looks like the bulk of the effort went into trying to be fancy with images download from the web. The walkthroughs are printed in multiple fonts--which makes them tough to read. There are much better guides available anyway. This book could have been much better. I was very disappointed. Save your money."
1,Can be summed up in one word: Boring.,"This book simply couldn't hold my interest. I just kept putting it down when I tried to read it. The plot was just utterly uninteresting. I don't mind overly wordy books, but I don't like boring ones, and this novel was boring. I would definitely not recommend reading it."
1,Captains Log: One BORING Trek novel !!!!!!,"zzzzzzz..thats all you will do if you read this tedious, wordy novel. Boring boring boring !!!!!! No wonder its thrown in discount bins around the galaxy. Live long and prosper but dont read this book!!"
5,Another Star Trek Horror book--Great for Halloween reading,"This book definitely ranks with others in what I like to call the ""Star Trek Horror"" subgenre. Other books in this unusual subgenre include Bloodthirst, ""Dark Mirror"" by Diane Duane, and ""Q Squared"" by Peter David. I especially liked the scenes of interaction between Sisko and Kai Opaka's ""ghost,"" or whatever she was--a great foreshadowing of the DS9 finale story ABC is showing right now! Kudos to Jeter and others for showing us that Star Trek doesn't have to be atheistic to be true to Gene Roddenberry's vision!"
1,Space..the boring frontier if you read this book!!,One has to be warped to read this boring wordy hardcover. I'm glad I only paid $3 bucks for it (2.99 too much in my opinion). The only good parts were the moments with Odo and Quark. Other than that it was a waste!!
4,more than just physics,"For readers who don't know German, the other book that has Einstein's correspondence from these years, in the original German, can be frustrating. So try this book.The contents lists the people that Einstein corresponded with. Even a casual perusing shows storied names. Max Planck. Arnold Sommerfeld. Paul Ehrenfest. Theo Kaluza. Fritz Haber. David Hilbert. Students of physics, maths and chemistry will readily recognise names; still familiar after almost a century.The actual letters reveal the intellectual and political ferment of Europe immediately after the Great War. They also indicate that Einstein was acutely aware of much more than just physics. He was in the midst of many changes, and an active participant."
2,Crazy is Crazy hot but goes downhill as the cd flows,"Crazy is a very nice track to groove to, but the rest of the CD I guess is one that will have to grow on you. Luckily they picked this as his first single."
1,Not what I ordered.,"Amazon is sending the wrong product; the one being sent is not ""Selenium"" and does not have the same dosage as the description and picture stipulates. I asked to return it to Amazon. The bottle that I received says ""RNA/DNA 100mg / 10mg"" which is similar to Selenium, but is definitely different from what is wanted. The description/picture says there is 180 tablets; however, the bottle I received has only 100 tablets."
1,bad,took forever then they sent wrong product rna/dna not worth the hassle to return do not buy any of there products cannot get hold of them for replacement
5,Nice tongs,These are great. A little big for indoor use but still work well. Really like the silicone so they don't melt and are colors are nice.
3,A Good Beginning,"This was a thouroughly interesting story that held my attention for its duration. The 3-D sound was great and listening with headphones made it come alive! What bothered me about it was that the story is comprised of log entries and letters so that there is virtually no interaction between the actors. It therfore gave the impression of being closer to an audio book than an audio drama, except that the readers read their parts in the first person (mostly). I was hoping for more, as I suppose I'd been a bit spoiled with all the wonderful Doctor Who audios out these days, but I am certainly looking forward to the others in this series and hope that Star Trek uses the full cast audio realm more in the future."
1,Not holding up!,"I agree with others - this bag does it's job. I've used 2 of them for 2 months for cloth diapers, and they are holding up well. My only complaint is they don't close well, and would be problematic if you had to travel anywhere with it as they would probably leak, and certainly smell with dirty diapers in there.An added note - Don't put them in the drier. Even on a low heat, the lining of one of mine separated from the bag, partially tore, and has come out.REVISION: Now having used these for nearly 5 months - they are falling apart! The PUL lining is virtually gone in both of my bags, despite line drying them. I have to order another brand, because these are definately moist and leaky when full, and are gross to handle when dirty. Right now, they leak some in the pail, adding just one more thing I have to clean. Yuck."
4,Bag works great!,"I bought two of these bags - a butter and a red colored one. They fit my 13 gallon diaper pail perfectly with a little room to spare. The red one bled color in a warm wash, so be careful with the bright colors."
4,Pretty good...,"I like this liner, but i wish that it would close a little more securely for transport. It is very hard to pull the drawstrings closed, meaning that I get to smell the stinky diapers all the way to the laundry. Not a huge deal, but I wish the drawstrings would close off the bag better. If you don't want the smell, get a wetbag instead. Swaddlebees wet bags are great!"
3,Loved it at first...,"I bought this wet bag to use downstairs without a pail. It worked great - no really bad smells escaped, wetness stayed in, etc... then it s.l.o.w.l.y began to fall apart. I would wash it about 50% of the time I did diapers and never put it in the dryer. We've been using it for a year now and the PUL has completely separated and has holes in it. I'll continue using this for dirty laundry, so not all is lost!!It was a great bag, for a year. We have another bag (different brand) that has held up (*same treatment)"
3,"For Full-Time Cloth Diapers, Not Heavy-Duty Enough","Bought two of these to use in diaper pails for our cloth diapers. Baby is now ten months old and one is falling apart due to frequent washings. Gave it an average rating, because it does work - it just won't last as long I wanted."
4,works well!,"we keep the ""shiny (PUL) side in"" for the pail and then reverse it for washing. this system works great for us!"
3,Doesn't fully close.,"I purchased this wet bag to line my dry pail for cloth diapers. It is waterproof and fits nicely in my pail, but I have never been able to pull the elastic drawstring tight enough to fully close the bag. I have to twist the top of the bag like a bread bag to keep all the ""fumes"" where they belong. The color is beautiful and hasn't faded. I wash this bag every other day with my prefolds and wraps and line dry. Although the color hasn't faded, The laminate on the inside is starting to pull away from the outer fabric, and there a few snags on the outside. I have a feeling I will have to buy a new one soon."
1,Poor Durablity,"We bought two of these and cycled between them. They generally worked well at first, and were water tight. The waterproof lining in both of them, however, eventually detached and ripped, leaving them essentially useless. One of ours lasted for two months, and the other lasted four months."
3,Plastic coating came off,"The bag served its purpose in holding wet/dirty cloth diapers for over 3 years, but the plastic waterproof coating came off pretty early. We did not put it in the dryer -just line-dried- and it peeled almost immediately in a couple of spots, then continued to peel over time. If we'd needed it to be waterproof, it wouldn't have worked."
3,"Product works well, but the drawing ability could use improvement","Up side: We like the bag for the size of it. It holds more than enough to get through the three day cycle of washing our cloth diapers and wipes. The quality of the material is good and has lasted through many cycles of washing and drying it in the dryer. We have 2 bags so that we to have one ready while the other is being washed.Down side: The draw string doesn't draw so easily. The cord is stretchy and the material doesn't want to scrunch together easily, and it takes great effort to get the bag to leave a small enough opening to get the diapers into the pail. Therefore, for the stinky diapers, it doesn't hold in the odor because you can't draw it tight. We hang ours next to the changing table and not a secondary container. Perhaps if you otherwise have the pail in a secondary, closed container, you won't have an issue."
2,Leaking after only 2 months of use,"This diaper pail liner looks really nice and seems heavy duty... however, it started leaking in the bottom corner when full of wet/dirty diapers. We've only been using this product for 2 months and I'm very disappointed that it's already started leaking at the seams."
4,"Great product for cloth diapers and wet clothes, but not perfect","This pail liner is great; the elastic top fits over my ""pail"" (garbage can) really well and hasn't overstretched at all. I throw this liner in the wash every 3 days, with 3 cycles, and has held up rather nicely, however, the PUL lining is starting to separate from the fabric. I bought this about 2 months ago, so I was disappointed about that, but if I didn't wash it in all 3 cycles with my cloth diapers and if I didn't put it in the dryer for so long, it probably would be in much better shape."
2,Doesn't last!,"I was happy with this product at first, but about a month after I bought it the lining started to separate from the outer fabric. Because it happened 30 days after I received the product (I noticed it around 35 days!) Amazon will not allow a return. I can't recommend this liner as it doesn't hold up in the wash."
2,Bag breaks down quickly,"Even with air drying the bag, it wasn't long before this product began to leak. The waterproof lining separates from the nylon and began to rip apart after a few months of use."
5,We found our adventure honeymoon!,"We couldn't find anything really adventurous that we wanted to do on our honeymoon -- we'd read about scuba diving, snorkeling, paradsailing in travel articles, but we didn't find THE destination for us until we read through this book and found four or five great islands that were perfect. Even better, this book has a giant contact sheet, so it took us no time at all to get to the islands' Web sites and request info. So we're off to the Seychelles next summer for our honeymoon! We can always go to Belize or to Thailand on another vacation. This is a great book for anyone who wants to do something really original on their honeymoon...and then keep these suggestions around for future travel plans. This is one wedding book I'm not handing off to my other engaged friends! I'm keeping this one!"
2,Boring voice,"Decent arrangements and ensemble, but unfortunately Claassen's voice is disappointingly devoid of expression and sounds amateurishly bland. Go with Cassandra Wilson or any of a dozen other singers for a more rewarding listening experience."
2,bad book,"very hard to read, very expensive for what it is. I buy this book for a course of telecommunication, and i dont use it because it is really bad! I sold this book right after i finish the course."
1,Ten thumps down,"Not comprehensive. Not very well-written. Plus, the author doesn't know much about Klingon culture. Reading the book is a waste of time. I even considered discarding the book"
4,Old time favorite,"What a nice collection of adventures under one umbrella story. Everyone is nicely in character, too.Recommended for fans of the Original Series."
5,Life-altering decisions,"While waiting for the Enterprise to rescue their severely damaged shuttlecraft, Kirk, Chekov, Sulu, and Scotty describe their experiences taking the Kobayashi Maru test, as taken by Lt. Saavik in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.This is a very interesting book. We've known for years that Kirk ""passed"" the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the computer, but the other stories were even more surprising:Chekov surrenders and evacuates his crew before setting his ship to self-destruct, much as Kirk & co. would do with the Enterprise in Star Trek III. Sulu absolutely refuses to cross the Neutral Zone, knowing that the Klingons would take it as an act of war and destroy his ship. And Scotty's story drives home the point that you should never send a devout engineer to do a captain's job. The stories they tell are personal, touching, and very heartwarming."
4,Increased libido,"This product appears to do what it says it will do - increase a woman's libido during menopause. It does take a couple of months to notice a change - but there is a change. Be patient - give it a try for a minimum of 2 months to start seeing your libido (being ""in the mood"") start to ramp up!"
5,Was there when it started.,"The Western Horseman is THE horse magazine. It started in 1936. My mother wrote an article that was published in Volume 2, Number 4 in 1937. It was about the cowboys in New Mexico along the Pecos River. The ranch was the Turkey Track. I would like to have the issue, but over the years it disappeared. We, she and I raised horses for many years in Kansas and Oklahoma until a back injury slowed me down.Over the years the magazine has kept up with the changing styles and breeds of western horses. More power to them!!Keep me in mind if you have the issue I mentioned, and would like to sell it to me."
5,Western Horseman Magazine Subscription,This is simply the best all-around horse magazine for Western-style riding and rodeo interests out there. I have been reading this magazine for 40 years and it has kept pace with the times. The price on Amazon is also the most competitive to be found - well worth the price. Happy reading!
1,not happy with auto renewal,"Auto renewal is a problem. You can't get the magazine stopped, nor can you stop the auto renewal without going through many many steps. Don't recommend it at all."
2,"Nice fit, but too hot","I liked the fit of this shirt, it is slim but not tight. However this shirt is not lightweight enough for warm climates."
4,This is a WINNER!!,"I have owned this wonderful product for nearly 4 three years and it's still going strong. Our GreatRoom (kitchen, living & dining room areas) has hardwood floors and carpets and the Oreck handles everything with ease. I really love the detachable feature. With one button ease I'm able to remove the head and get crumbs around the refrigerator and prep areas, dust along the edges and get crumbs in the drawers. Why wipe when you can vacuum? Oreck's powerful suction picks up sugar spills on the counter and floor in a flash and the beater-bar does a nice job on low profile rugs. I use it everyday after the grandkids leave to freshen up and it keeps a charge for nearly a week. It won't replace your big vac but it will save you dragging it out for quick pickups. It's so light weight that my 3 yr old granddaughter even insists on picking up her own messes. The broom stores easily too. It's well constructed and looks as good today as it did when it was brand new."
2,vacuum got no suck!,"I've had my Oreck ""electric broom"" for about 4 years now and it never ceases to underwhelm me. It has never had much suction at best, but if you really want to disappoint, try the hand held dust buster attachment by itself. I could do a better job with my hands and a dust pan. I guess i've only put up with it for this long because it was an attractive little vacuum and i kept hoping..... So I'm now disallusioned and am looking for another model stick vacuum so i can get rid of this thing altogether. Look somewhere other than Oreck for your stick vacuum! I like my regular upright Oreck,though, but their cannister vac isn't very good either."
2,Low Suction and Battery Life,Battery Life is only 15 Minutes and then requires charging.The Suction is not very strong.I would not buy this product again.
5,Great...,This documentary is a greatly detailed account of the 1986 finding of the Titanic by Robert Ballard and his team.There is a lot of great footage of the sunken ship as well as interactive menus with extras.It goes into brief history of the ship and its tragic end. It is mostly about the 1986 exploration.Buy it.Enjoy
5,GREAT!!,"Yes, how many times can you recycle that tragic accident, but this had a different swing on the whole thing. I am always on the lookout for new things to add to my classroom, especially things to go with the stories in our basal reader. This is another ""magic"" trick to add excitement to the story."
4,Worth viewing,"A good update on Bob Ballard's quest to find the Titanic. The Titanic Exhibit is currently in our city and this, coupled with other Titanic videos and books have helped learning about the whole story.Whether you see the exhibit or not, if you are interested in the Titanic, this is an important part of the story."
4,Present for Granddaughter,I bought this video for my granddaughter for Chanukah and she loved it. She is into all things Titanic and she has added this video to her top ten list of favorite Titanic things.
4,I would have given it 5 stars but...,"What the heck happened to the intro to ""Hard To Be In Love With You""? On the original LP, tape and CD, you hear Daryl Hall screaming ""Ba-Bap!"" or ""Wop Bop"", then the drums kick in.On this supposed ""deluxe remaster"", you don't get to hear that!Who put this this remaster together? Hellen Keller!Plus, parts of the CD are hissy (listen to the beginning of ""Big Kids"").I'm glad BMG is releasing the Hall & Oates back catalog. I just wish there was a little more attention to detail!!Damn!"
3,Adequate introduction,"The author is a likable guy and he gives someswell advice about choosing an instrument. I hadowned an accordion for years before watching thisso I had figured out a lot of stuff on my own -even though I'm still not very good at playing.His advice is the same sort you would get aboutlearning the piano - play Hanon exercises. Heshows how to play the bass side of the accordion,how to shake the bellows, etc...If you a rank beginner with the accordion andyou don't know music I don't think you'll get muchout of this. If you know music and want to learnthe accordion you'll find it much more useful.Professor Louie's Rock and Blues Accordion coversmuch of the same material and has more stuff aswell - a decent primer on how to play some Bluesjams on the instrument. I would recommendthe Professor's DVD before this one."
5,Very satisfied with product and delivery,"CD Swinging Hour in New York by Thilo Wolf, Very satisfied with product and delivery - Randy Brecker's Trumpet Playing is always fresh, exciting, and inventive."
4,"I was a little disapointed, but not too much","There is a lot of action, suspense, and some seriously complicated relationships are explained in-depth. I enjoyed it, but not as much as the first book. Several charachters are brought in that were not in the last book, even Thomas Riker(if you remember that transported accident in which Riker was duplicated) which adds quite an interresting plot. There were still a few questions which I don't think were answered well enough but the book contains betrayal, romulans....and I thought of writing more but don't want to ruin the reading experience of discovering it for yourself."
2,Flat Sequel,"As someone who loved ""Imzadi"" (and who even re-read it after reading this to confirm how good it is), I was quite disappointed with this almost lifeless novel. The character insights that PAD usually provides in even his lighter Trek books are missing, as is (for the first time ever!) his sense of humor. We get a bland Worf, a bland Deanna, and a rather bland Sela (Yar's Romulan child). Only the two Rikers - Will and his photocopy Tom - have nay personality at all. What's more, the plots behind the characters are dull, a letdown following the cosmic adventures PAD gave us in ""Imzadi,"" ""Q-Squared"" and even ""The Captain's Daughter.""I don't what happened to Peter. I would say he's been edited to death in this novel. But regardless of why this is so bland, it is just not worth buying. Find it a library instead, and don't expect anything more than an average episode of Trek."
3,"Good story, but sequel does not live up to original!","I read the first ""Imzadi"" when it first was published. Great story, because I love time travel stories. However, this one was far too different and not as interesting as the original. I read the original in only three days where it took about a whole week to read this one. Peter David normally writes things I have trouble putting down, but this one was a bit of a disappointment. An interesting read, but only average. In all, I prefer novelizations that occur on the Enterprise-D. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy this one as much."
4,almost perfect,"WARNING: The folowing reveiw ruins a few surpirses.I loved Imzadi. I thought it was nefo the best love stories i have read. It was perfect. When i heard of a sequel i was naturally very happy, but unfortunately this one was par. While the return of tomas riker was a srpirse and always a joy, the ending left me saying ""That's it?"" Aftert the first one I figured no sequel was really ness. At all. But this is a very funny book, and worth reading just not as good as the first."
2,What was he thinking?,"First of all, I LOVED Imzadi. I've read it several times. So, naturally I thought I would like Imzadi II. WRONG. You have to give the book some credit for being written by Peter David, but that's about as far as it will go. I had to throw the book across the room several times. All Imzadi fans need to read this book, but think of it as an obligatory commitment to finish the duo. And do NOT expect it to hold a candle to Imzadi."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I was very excited to read this book. Part one was great, and I love Peter David as an author. But, this book, I felt, was so boring. Only 20% of the book was good. It was one of the worst Star Trek - The Next Generation books I have ever read. I cannot reccommend it to anyone."
3,This book would have been much better...,"...if it was not placed in ST universe. As it is, I would have probably given it 2.5 stars, if I could. This story is not really a triangle (especially since both Tom and Will Riker are contenders for Diana's heart), but the romance angle is not even the most important part of this novel. Sure, it gets interesting with the deepreaching plots and such, but it seems that the author outwitted himself by cramming in all the info and action. The book reads as a comedy of errors. To top that, every time I saw what Wolf does, thinks of says, I could not quite belive it. Peter David have never gotten him right, not in any of the books, I have seen at any case. And there are some of the characters in this novel whose motivations I still do not understand. In short, reading this book is not something I want to repeat. I had to force myself to finish it as it is."
4,Fills in one of the gaps between TNG and the movies,"Peter David is one of the funnest Trek writers out there and this book is another example of his grasp on the Trek universe. He handles the characters with the right level of emotion and wit that the books become real page-tuners for even non-trek readers. After the action stopped, the resolution of the Work/Troi/Riker triangle had me laughing out-loud."
3,"Not as good as his first, but David can weave a good tale","I waited with anticipation for this novel to be released. When I finally got it and dove right in, I found ""Imzadi II""... wanting. It didn't quite keep my interest as his past novels. There was so much going on, I had a hard time keeping up with the players. I'm probably one of the biggest Peter David fans I know, but this novel didn't rate quite as high as others. David possibly could be stretching himself thin with his novels, comics, television series, and weekly column. I'm reading his latest ""New Frontier"" novel now and I can see now where his love lies... in a Star Trek universe HE created."
3,Pleasing read but not as much as the first IMZADI.....,"I love Peter David's writing style and always enjoy his TREK novels. His use of back history, humor and characterization make for a truly pleasing read. I always found the Deanna Troi/Worf relationship on the TV series to be not being very convincing so I was glad to see it resolved. I was surprised to see the return of Tom Riker and Sela because I found them to be useless characters but not the way they are written up in this story. David uses them extensively with much more personality than they have ever been portrayed with before.Other bits I enjoyed were the inclusion of Dickens' A Christmas Carol with Capt Picard (since Patrick Stewart played Scrooge on stage), the surprise appearance of another Deep Space 9 character (read the book if you want to know who it is!!) and Worf mourning his lost loves K'helyr and Jadzia.A good novel but not as great as the first IMZADI but then again a Peter David Trek adventure is always an excellent read."
2,The first Imzadi was by far better,"I read Imzadi in one day, loving every bit of it. It was by far the best ST:TNG book I've read. And while Imzadi II captures the characters perfectly to their TV series portrayals.. the plot is disapointing, and the ending even more so. I found myself saying ""What the heck?"" and ""You gotta be kidding me"" at the ending. It was ridiculous and made Riker and Troi seem impulsive, indecisive, immature, selfish, when their relationship aboard the Enterprise (during the TV series) was much more secure and understood between them both than in this book. The ONLY part of the book I found thoughtful of the author was the part about Picard trying to get Will's ""twin"" back on the moral track by using a Dicken's book (which was actually a shape shifter..bad plot there). So 2 stars for the effort of trying to follow an amzing book, I would still read an Imzadi III in hopes it would live up to the first Imzadi."
5,A Required Reference Source,"""Surnames of Scotland"" provides a valuable reference for our Scottish clan organization. We participate in Scottish games and highland gatherings throughout northern California, where we are continually approached by visitors who have questions about their heritage. This well-researched guide gives the documentary history of names appearing in historic records throughout Scotland, along with the date and location of the occurence and ancillary historical information where it is available. For any student of Scottish families, this book provides a very helpful reference. Definitely recommended."
4,"don't own the book, but just saw the museum show...","i haven't bought this book (yet), but i just saw the corresponding show at the fashion institute of technology's museum, and it's incredible. it's a great span of accessories that are put together chronologically. the whole thing really gives you a perspective on how the accessories sort of link up with apparel from the time.really- if you have a chance to see the show in nyc, do. otherwise, buy the book!"
1,This book really sucks!,"This book is the worst book on stat. thermodynamics I have read. The logic is kind of out of order, and the author seems in love of tons and tons of equations and formulas to hide his ignorance in physics, I mean, the deep understanding of the physics underlying this field. However, it would be fine to those who enjoy deriving equations..."
3,Good dryer for a cheap price,"I have had this hair dryer longer than I can remember, at least 7 years. It has consistently worked well over the years. Just recently has it started making odd noises, probably indicating that it's time for a new one.It has 3 heat settings, and 3 speed settings. It also has a cool shot button, however, I find that the cool setting is much cooler than the button.I have very thick, curly hair down to the middle of my back. With this hair dryer, it takes me around 15 minutes to get my hair dry, not styled, just completely dry brushing it as I dry. There is no way with my hair that I could use this dryer and nothing else and step outside my house. My hair is just way too frizzy afterwards.The dryer doesn't seem unusually heavy, but not light weight by any means. Since my hair takes a while to dry, towards the last few minutes my arms start to get pretty heavy from holding it.Overall, it's a great little dryer and has done better than expected given how long I have had it."
4,Relaxed Baggies,"The quality of Lee jeans is great in my opinion and I've worn this brand for many years. The department store that I used to buy them in has gone out of business so I found them here at Amazon. These jeans are not a heavy duty denim, but a lighter version that is comfortable to wear all day. I agree with the other reviews that mentioned these sizes run BIG. As I'm losing weight my size 16 was too loose so I ordered size 14. They are nearly as baggy as the size 16 were, so I didn't achieve the closer fit I was looking for. Although I could have sent them back for an exchange, I didn't want the delay time since I needed these for work at my summer job. Washing them in hot water and a hot dryer helped them shrink a bit, but if you're not looking for a baggy, saggy look, buying a size smaller than you normally wear would be my advice."
3,Need to be longer,"I kept my Lee jeans because I didn't want to pay the shipping to return them, but they were a tad darker than I expected and not nearly long enough for ""Long"" jeans. I can only get ""longs"" on-line so I'm at the mercy of always paying extra for shipping. I like the way they fit, just wish I could get them 1 1/2"" to 2 inches longer. I drip dry them to keep the lengh I have."
5,"b-featherson and pepperstone stretch, 16 long",Jeans fit my 198 lb. senior-citizennized body (lumps and all) just right; jeans were as presented and worth the effort; thanks; bailey-featherson
2,Too big in the waist,If you have a feminine waistline these jeans won't fit you. They fit my hips and thighs but were at least 4 inches to big in the waist. I returned them.
2,strange fit,"I ordered a petite size and the pants were even shorter and wider than I expected, even for a ""relaxed fit petite."" They were a litle clown-pants-like."
2,Size fit bigger than I would have liked.,"I know I am losing weight but a 16 long usually fits me pretty good. I bought a size 16 long and these seem to fit almost like a size 18 or bigger. I have other 16 longs in other colors and they fit tighter. I am ordering a 14 long to see how they fit. Otherwise, I love the straight leg but the material is light weight. Whatever happened to durable, heavier jeans? The seams always are a bit off as well. I love Lee jeans but I feel the quality is really going downhill. If it continues, I'll probably be switching brands. I have been a Lee jeans consumer for 30 years but I will switch if I have to.P.S. I did finally switch brands. Down to size 10 tall/long in a different brand! Lee is history with me!"
2,Incorrect jeans sent,The jeans received were not the ones I searched for. The fit is not the same and they have been returned. I will be going to the mall this weekend to try to locate the style I really do want.
3,Mom jeans,FYI These are definitely mom jeans. They go up high on the waist and have wide-set back pockets. I kinda find the high waist comfortable though. I'm keeping them because I'm going to wear them to work with longer shirts but these are MOM JEANS for sure.
1,no Lee made in USA,Don't bother looking for Lee jeans made in USA. Mine said made in Mexico and after calling North Carolina I learned that Lee no longer manufactures in the US. It really would be great to find US made womans jeans.
3,Legs too wide,"I purchased these as a Daily Deal. The price was very good. I believe they were being discontinued. I would not have purchased these jeans if I had known the legs were so wide. I guess I misunderstood what was meant by ""straight leg"". I wear them but they are a little too relaxed for me."
3,Lee Rider Jeans,"I was looking for a style of Lee Rider's that I wore which had a great fit. This was the closest I could find since WalMart stopped carrying the Lee brand but they really do not fit as well--very baggy. Regardless, they are comfortable and something to wear around the house/gardening/etc. Also, in my experience the Lee brand has proved to be very durable as well."
5,My jeans,I owned two pairs of these jeans in different colors and like them so much that I don't know why it took me so long to buy them in black. I wish all my clothes were this comfortable.
3,"A matte finish, 'anit-glare' screen protector for the Motorola Droid.","A matte finish, 'anit-glare' screen protector for the Motorola Droid. Great for cutting glare on the brilliant, yet highly reflective screen on the Droid, especially when outdoors. Made my phone actually usable outside - I don't find myself searching for a spot of shade just to see what's on the screen. (Complaints) The installation of this screen protector can be tedious & difficult if you don't have the patience. Even though I took extra care installing it, I wasn't able to get a perfect seal without any air bubbles. I gave 3 stars because of the price - I thought I was getting more than one screen protector in the package, especially when there are so many alternatives brands out there."
3,Not so great,This product was okay but not so great. It still allows a bad glare and it still receives some finger prints so you might as well by a cheaper clearer one.
1,Droid Anti-Glare Display Protectors 3-pack,"I had no trouble applying the protector, however, once completed, the white tab that you are instructed to remove after applying the protector did not come off cleanly -- in fact -- I could not scrape it off with a knife without damaging the protector. Consequently -- $13 just went down the drain."
1,More trouble than it's worth,You would think with the price they charge for this little piece of plastic they could give you 2 so when you mess up the 1st you can try again with the second. It is VERY difficult to get on right and by the time you do you're guaranteed to have caught a couple of pieces of dirt or lint under the protector. The plastic is cut way too close to the actual size of the screen. If they made it a bit smaller it might be easier to install.Once installed any lint or dirt underneath will drive you crazy. The plastic also distorts the Droid screen if you view it at an angle. Save your money and take a pass on this product.
4,Gueden is charming and vivacious,"This CD, which has enraptured the other reviewers here, features Hilde Gueden, one of the stalwarts of the Vienna State Opera in the Fifties, singing operetta chestnuts as well as two numbers by the last composer in the operetta tradition, Robert Stoltz, who also conducts. Gueden is thoroughly idiomatic, but Schwarzkopf and Rita Streich are more billiant and inspired. A couple of numbers, such as the entrance song from Kalman's countess Maritza, are too heavy for Gueden's light coloratura, especially in the lower range. By 1961, when this recording was made, the soprano was 44, not in freshest voice but sitll quite good.In all, this vivacious recital will thrill die-hard operetta lovers, and I enjoyed it, too, just not to the point of rapture."
1,Denise Austin is a lousy yoga teacher,"Denise Austin misses completely on the concepts of yoga, the importance of precise poses, and the correct pace (slow) that yoga should be done at. I strongly do not recommend this video. Zero stars."
1,spend your $ and energy elsewhere,"This is a very poor yoga tape. Denise Austin completely ignores the basic principles of yoga. For a much better, safer, and engaging yoga video check out Patrica Walden (for more instructionally oriented yoga) or Rodney Yee if you are interested in high-energy. I would not recommend Denise Austin yoga videos to anyone, at any level."
4,Tuneful vocal pop,"This collection contains most of Dawn's hits, like Knock Three Times, Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Old Oak Tree, Candida, What Are You Doing Sunday?, Who's In The Strawberry Patch With Sally and Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose?, plus some lesser known album tracks.They were the masters of melodic vocal pop and they really shine on those hits, especially the aforementioned Knock Three Times which is a brilliant piece of power pop. Some of the album tracks are so-so, but overall this album takes one back to a happier era of tuneful pop.Dawn were Tony Orlando and two gorgeous female vocalists, and they certainly made their mark with their particular brand of seventies sing-along sounds. If you like vocal pop with personality, you'll love this album."
4,"Aahh, the memories.",Remastered Digital sounds good. Great songs to be practicing with if you want to do Karaoke sometime.
2,Who puts these collections together?,"BMG/Heritage's ""Platinum & Gold"" series was, to quote the insert about the series included in each disc, ""The #1 Place to Find The ""Best Of"". Well, their Tony Orlando & Dawn disc miserably fails to live up to its own promise. The ""digital remastering for the best sound possible"" (another quote from the insert) here makes the songs sound harsh and tinny. And considering ""Did You Ever Think She'd Run Away From You"" and ""Carmen"" weren't even hits, and could have been replaced by ""I Play and Sing"" and ""Summer Sand"", which WERE hits, and that the disc doesn't follow hits-collection protocol (not chronological), this disc falls VERY flat indeed."
5,A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE,"This CD contained all of the hits of Tony Orlando and Dawn. Each melody brought a smile and a memory to my face. If you liked the group in the 70's, you will thoroughly enjoy this collection of all-time favorites."
2,Less punchy then expected.,"I own two other Jo-el Sonier CDs; ""Cajun Roots"" and ""Cajun LIfe."" I felt that his accordian playing took a back seat and in many instances; listening to it while working, a few of the tracks blended together. As another reveiwer wrote that he missed the vocals, I did as well. Over all I felt it lacks that Cajun punch that his other two CDs had. I would really like to see this one back into production to Cajunize it more."
4,Only good if you have Excess Copper or Low Zinc,"Her theory is that copper may be causing fatigue in some people, however, this is rare as most of us are able to excrete any excess copper. Thus, you should get a hair analysis test done to find out (you can buy these online for about $80). If you do indeed have excess copper you can follow the supplement and dietary guidelines she provides. Her advise is holistic, so recovery will most likely take longer. There are a couple of prescription meds available to help rid of excess copper which she does not discuss at all.She also discusses the very important role of zinc (which will also be tested if you order a hair analysis). Although I did not test high for copper, I do have very low zinc and thanks to this book I can work on that which should help in my overall health.If you have copper overload or low zinc there is a ""Nutritional Data"" website that will tell you exactly how much of each is in different foods."
5,Way Ahead of the Rest - As Usual,"I was given this book as a birthday present along with a hair analysis kit...Low and behold I learned I was copper toxic.. Now that I am on Gittleman's program, I am sleeping and have my mind back. I am so grateful that somebody had the guts to write such a book especially because there is no other real documentation out there about copper. This woman is a brave pioneer. '"
1,DISTRESSING EXAGGERATION OF A MINOR PROBLEM!,"I was distressed that Anne Louise spent on a whole book on this topic. It is obviously a problem that affects a few people, but having too much copper in your body is not an epidemic, and she is really almost hysterical in this book by suggesting that it is. I also cannot believe she seriously thinks that a questionnaire can tell you whether you have too much copper in your body. Only testing can show that. She is usually such a good writer, but this time, I have to say, ANNE LOUISE, GIVE ME A BREAK!"
2,Let's not get too carried away...,"OK, copper is important, and we shouldn't have too much of it. Fine. But a whole book about it? Give me a break! There is a lot of interesting information in here, but this topic could be covered in a pamplet!"
1,Not so hot.,"OK, not great. Maybe Anne Louise is writing too many books. Read Supernutrition for Women, her best book overall."
1,"A nice book, but way too much for one subject...","Anne Louise Gittleman has written some great books over the years--her best still remains Beyond Pritikin. Read that one, not this one. I think she is going over the top about the downside of a nutrient, that, if I have read other books correctly (The Real Vitamin Mineral Book by Shari Lieberman and Dr. Atkins Vita-Nutrient Solution by Robert Atkins, M.D.) is actually essential, and one that many Americans do not get enough of."
2,Too Wordy...Left Me Hanging!,"Even though this is a small paperback book, Ms. Gittleman has managed to bore the reader with redundant stories and medical terminology. I was so bored with the first half of the book, that I had to skip to the end to find out ""Why I Am So Tired"" and what I could do to cure my coper imbalance.Unfortunately, after reading the book, I still have many questions that were not answered. Save your money!"
4,Too many words for what could be said in one chapter.,"After looking over most of the other reviews, they can be divided into two categories. Those that loved the book and it changed their life, and those that thought it was a textbook on how to be cheap. I saw very little new information in this book. I enjoyed reading it because I enjoy learning that I am already doing things right. I felt the book was way too repetitive though. How many ways can you tell the reader that the way to wealth is through frugal living? Also, way to many tables were included. Finally, the last chapter seemed to be an afterthought. Perhaps the authors should have spent more time on that part of the book, exploring ways for us to change our habits."
2,"Boring, wordy, but learned a thing or two.",This book seems too be way too long for the information it provides. You could have summed it up in about three pages. And Duh! if you make a lot of money and don't spend it you will be a millionare. I'm sure about 85% of the population of Beverly Hills also has a nice retirement plan set up for them dispite their lavish lifestyle. I personally believe it is possible to live well and stil accumulate wealth. In twenty years when I am cruising down sunset Blvd. in my Ferrari I'll be sure to stop by my accountants and make sure I got enough to retire on.
2,Good Advice However,"I think that it offers good tips, HOWEVER. I have a friend who is super cheap. Which is fine if you don't want to spend your money on yourself but money shouldn't come out of my pocket to help you. she is the type to never contribute to gas and tolls on trips, and never take her car. Always seem to be short a dinner or the cover charge in a club. I could go on and on with incidents, but I stopped going anywhere with her for this reason. I noticed in her profile she listed this book as one of her favorites. I think it offers a guideline but it is sometimes not frugal but acting cheap. so I understand why many say this about the book. What are you saving your money for, but to spend it later."
2,"The ""Japanese"" Next Door","Look at the Japanese, they are doing exactly everything what the two authors are talking about and see how their economy is doing now."
1,An american desease : MONEY,"This book well reflects the american obsession with money ; beyond a few anecdotes which will make you smile, its only interest is to see how Americans are obsessed with money. I am worried that it shows very clearly this widely shared feeling in the USA that everything can be measured in dollars. I am sorry this is not. Hopefully a vast majority of human beings outside the USA don't feel that way either.... I hope it is not a fatal desease...."
1,Overrated,"While the book has some interesting insights into the wealthy, what is the point of amassing a fortune if you're living well below your means? If you're looking to make some money I recommend you read some books on investing. Phil Town's book ""Rule #!"" is a great book based on the same investment strategies that Warren Buffet uses."
1,Lots of fluff,"I can't believe how many people are drooling over this book. It was full of fluff - spend wisely, hyper-consumption is not the route to take blahblahblah. It was the same basic idea reiterated over and over. As others have said, save yourself the $10 for this book and you're on your way to becoming a millionaire!"
3,The Millionaire Next Door (Money Matters),"The Millionaire Next Door taught me that if I want to become rich and I am not an athlete or music star, I have to really work hard. One needs to save all that he earns in order to have a decent net worth. One also has to invest their money to continue to gain. There is no way one can live a life with a huge house and nice car(s)and have a net worth of $10 million."
1,Choose occupation wisely,"People really miss the main point of this book, that being the part about choosing one's occupation wisely. Without the right occupation, no matter how much frugality one institutes in their life, a person will never be rich. Case closed.Making enough money and not spending it are the keys to becoming rich for someone who is not wealthy and does not come from a rich famuly.Most people will never be rich because they do not have the ""right"" occupation."
2,Beats a dead horse,"This book has a great start but slowly plateaus of useful information. Would I have bought it and read the book if I knew this? Yes. Just beware, the book gets very stale and repetitive in the final third portion. The book is written concerning conclusions after demographic study of today's wealthy. CAUTION! This book is ALL about earning and saving $MONEY$. The two Ph.D.'s who write the book only provide the data which they were paid to collect for the corporations they were tasked to research for. They present the material in a matter of fact manner where accumulating wealth whatever the cost. I would be concerned about the relational health of their families. The book demonstrates the authors' lack of concern to life, health and family in this publication. These issues have no implied value to these authors.However; there are some nice lessons to be learned."
2,Done Better Elsewhere,"Save yourself a few bucks and about a hundred pages of reading and get a cheap paperback copy of The Richest Man in Babylon instead.The Millionaire Next Door encourages using thrift and planning to accumulate wealth. This is a good thing, and I highly recommend everyone read at least one book showing you that it is possible to have financial security with just a little bit of planning. I just believe it's been done better elsewhere."
3,40 pages worth of excellent material,"good study and insightful approach, but too much of dragging and junk evaluation (tables ,tables and irritating tables with all stupid numbers)still worthy reading as u know exactly why someone is welathy and others not!!"
2,"TOO LONG, good info","This book had some good information on how to save money, but I felt that the concepts were somewhat stupid. The book is basically just statistics stated over and over again. The authors should have written a pamphlet, not a book."
3,Why to get rich?,If your are rich and you depend on somebody oron something: then your are not free.Why not being independet? Therefore: fix yourtargets first
3,"Take this to heart, and no one will invite you to dinner.","The authors take about 30,000 words to say the following: save your money, don't spend like an idiot on dumb ass consumer items, and invest like a maddog, and you, too, can have a whole bunch of money when you die. The problem is, you end up with a rather dull life. Its useful to take some of the lessons from this book, but, for Goddsake, don't turn it into a mantra. Or else you'll be wearing crappy suits and driving dull pale blue sedans youre whole life, counting your pennies and behaving like a cranky old miser"
2,No brainer,"I read this book a few years back because people had hyped it up so much. I'll save you an hour of your life and $10:1. Dont buy ANYTHING (only a slight exaggeration if you read this book)2. Live within (or below) your means3. Save moneyAdd a dash of time and voila! You're a millionaire, but one with an exceptionally dull life of excessive frugality."
5,an excellent book,"even the smallest income can be made to go tremendous distances if the principals in this book are followed. or, if you are like me, you can at least hazard a more educated guess as to why you are so poor after reading this excellent book."
3,Interesting tips,"The Millionaire Next Door was very interesting. The book tells the reader mainly seven tips in becoming a millionaire. I think that these tips really could help you in life in making money, but the reason i gave it only 3 stars was I thought the book over generalized who millionaires really are. I didn't alway agree with how millionaires lived because not all live the way the book says. But some millionaires do and this book gives people good tips and ideas. Some of statistics were surprising. It's a good read."
2,Preachy and wordy -- a waste of time,"This book is wordy and poorly written. It's really a short magazine article padded to make a book. The authors are preachy, and they say the same things over and over and over. Then, in case you didn't get their point the first 3 times, they give you an example or two. And, if that isn't bad enough, they give the impression that they don't really like the people they interviewed. The entire book is mean-spirited. I learned very little from this book."
2,Ebenezer Scrooge Next Door,"""You, too, can be an Ebenezer Scrooge!"" As far as I'm concerned, that should be the subtitle for this book. Yes, I believe whole-heartedly in living beneath one's means, but not to the point of becoming a miser. MND paints a ghastly picture of someone with a 12-year-old car, sadly outdated clothes, and a puny house in an average neighborhood...but hey, he's clutching a seven-figure bank account balance, so what does he care if he's miserable!! I believe there is a happy medium between one extreme of an overextended spendthrift and the other of a tight-fisted miser declaring ""My favorite charity is me!"" I know this is possible because I am an example of it- at 26, I sock away 15% (and most windfalls) to my nest egg which is on track to hit a million while I'm in my thirties, yet I also travel and splurge occasionally on little luxuries. I believe in the best of BOTH worlds, but MND seems to purport that this is not possible. Believe me- it is!!"
1,Not worth the money or time to read it.,"This book is simply clever marketing of common sense money management. It could be reduced down to a couple of chapters. Basically all the advice and anecdotes boil down to is to live within or beneath your means, save a percentage of your income and invest it carefully. There are a few pearls of wisdom, but they are few and far between, and not worth the time it takes to read the book. There are much better books on money management that actually help you construct and realize a plan for your financial health."
1,The most useless book I have ever read.,"The whole premise of this book is that if you don't spend any money you will be rich. Duh. You also won't enjoy life. The authors never really even say why you would want all this money that you can't spend. There is definitely one situation in which you should take the authors' suggestion: don't buy this book. If you want a good book on personal finance, get Eric Tyson's Personal Finance for Dummies."
4,millionaires,"the book was on time didn't even feel like I waited at all, even though it was a used book it was in great condition it came with a little cute bookmark that I use. although I have not gotten around to finishing it it has been very useful thus far."
4,Interesting stuff,"I have been listening to the version on CDs. I have found it quite interesting and I recommend it. The only drawback is that it seems a bit repetitious in some places--making the same points over again--but you can learn much from others mistakes if you take the recommendations to heart. Too many of us squander our resources just to impress others (or ourselves). If you are married, it is important to get your spouse to hear (or read) this book, as you must both be ""on the same page"" to make the principles it presents work."
4,The Millionaire Next Door,This is a very helpful book. It will guide you about how to improve your wealth mainly cutting those unnecessary expenses in your life. I use to believe that the millionaires were those how expend a lot of money. Now I have recognize how really is the millionaire and how can I built my way to become one of them.
4,The Millionaire Next Door,I haven't finished the book yet but for what i have read i really am enjoying it.
1,Logically flawed and banal.,"The basic premise of this book, that everyone wishes or shouldwish to accunulate wealth, is unexamined by the authors and ispatently false. The methodology is equally questionable. Surveys by questionaire,when the respondents are self-selected, are always suspect, although they do allow people so inclined to construct impressive tables for that quasi-statisical look. And don't I recall the impecunious Mr. Micawber teaching the young David Copperfield the same economic lesson as this book teaches: if you spend more than you make, you will go into debt, but if you spend less than you make, you will accunulate wealth? Of course Mr. Micawber didn't put an arbitrary figure on what wealth amounted to."
2,"Superficial, repetitive,simplistic","There is no question that the book provides good advice to consumer oriented American society. But,it fails to deal with living choices, balancing the pleasure of luxury vs a large bank account. Life is short and self denial does not seem a satisfactory way to live it.The so called statistics are laughable. They remind me of numerous professional lectures in which the presenter thinks that a series of slides with a "" laundry list "" of data is effective education.Page after page of repitition does not make for good reading.The message here would have been easily delivered in one half the space.In short, the concept is laudable, but the research and the way it is delivered is a joke."
2,Good info but too dry for me,"This book is just as advertised but very boring to me. I was amazed by many of the little factoids sprinkled throughout the book. However, I quickly lost interest and never could bring myself to finish it. I think the information is valuable but I had a hard time staying intterested once I decided that I did not accept the authors definition of wealth. I found ""wealth"" in the authors view, to be very stringent and constricting and it flew in the face of one truly enjoying life. But if you are interested in seeing into the mind of an owner of local pizza shops, who drives the same car he drove in 1972, then this is the book for you."
3,Hyperspenders versus Scrooge?,I believe that this is indeed an interesting book on the lifestyles of true millionaires in the US. However I found it rather disappointing that it advocates that becoming a millionaire means hoarding all your money away for years and never living to actually enjoy it and life. What's the point of accumulating millions in wealth if that's all it does is sit there? I would have found it more helpful if the authors portrayed millionaires who not only had a hold on their finances but were able to use them for their own enjoyment.
5,Grab Your Notepad & Surrender!,"This is very good information if practiced. I have not been able to stop listening. I am now buying the book for easier note taking.If you do not like change DO NOT READ!This is all about mindset, and discipline. If you are willing, you to can join the select few who have achieved millonaire status.You will learn though that status is exactly the oppitsite to becoming a millionaire."
1,BUY THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON INSTEAD,"If you want to become like the rich uncle of Donald Duck by the time you retire, then read this book. If you want some fun and balance into your life, read The Richest Man In Babylon instead."
4,Insider Info,"A good view inside the wealthy people and how they did it. Also highly recommend the ""Mind of a Trader"" on how more specifically some people became wealthy on the stock markets."
3,Authors missed the point,"There are some interesting insights in this book, as I would never have imagined that my next-door neighbor who drives a beat-up Chrysler and wears worn-out boots is a millionaire. The authors do a good job telling us how to increase our net worth. However, they missed one point: people aren't very interested in having a high net worth. They would much rather consume. Having lots of money in the bank is no fun. Spending it is.True, having money saved up leads to financial security. But having lots of money in storage is not an end in itself."
3,A good read for beginers but gets boring toward the end.,"I found this book to be a good introduction to the world of personal finance being a 2nd year college student. It starts off giving good examples of situations but sometimes goes to extremes in making its points. For example, in some situations people are portrayed as almost imcompetent if they dont save the same amount of money as others or if they get cash gifts from their parents. Overall though I enjoyed the book."
3,Split feelings,"This book was an interesting split. It validates what you are doing as well as encourages you to do more. You can feel good about saving instead of spending, and you can even ""look down"" on those with nice cars, etc. Halfway through the book however, the constant reiteration of the same point becomes monotonous. The book carries a very ""working class hero"" tone which becomes tiresome because it is poured on so heavily. The saving concepts presented are solid enough to make the book worth recommending."
3,Lotsa bucks and not much else,"I found this book in a thrift shop, a strategy the authors surely would applaud (even if it doesn't augment their attempts to accrue prodigious wealth). While many of their observations and data hold true, there are two constraints they should have mentioned. One is possible cohort effects. Most of the millionaires they interviewed appeared to have grown up in the Depression, when attitudes toward money and resources were shaped by a particular time in history. Will the ""Millionaires Next Door"" in 2010 look the same? The second is: where does the fun of life enter in? Yes, one can save money by buying old cars, eating in diners, living in a trailer, and buying clothes at Sears, but what about enjoyment? There's something to be said for appreciating the finer things in life when one is around to do so, and not everyone lives forever, no matter how good their financial planning may be. The moralistic tone invoked for any discussion of luxury goods was offputting."
2,To sum up this book....,"This book is heavy with surveys and statistical information that all say the same thing...showing the world you have money does not mean you have money. Save, save, save! I just saved you 11 bucks."
1,The Masochist Next Door,"I have to hand it to the marketers of this book - they got me! Caught me in an airport in a rush. Excellent title and packaging! After reading about half-way through, I finally figured out how those millionnaires do it - they live like the homeless. Just to think the solution was always staring me right in the face....."
3,I expected somewhat of a story. Book is more data driven.,"I recently read this book and was dissapointed with the content. I expected somewhat of a story line like ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" but soon found myself drowning in page after page of statistics and data. The book ended up becoming a quick skim and helped me understand some of the categories I fell into. Other than that, I would not recommend this book if you are looking for financial insight and some basic principles you can use to get ahead."
2,Pretense and Denial: A Guide for the Aspiring Well To Do.,"As america's tectonic plates adjust to releive economic strain, the surface gaps of inequity widen. The Millionaire Next Door increases this great class divide with a contrived air of monetary principles. One is left to question the author's pomposity and sycophantic grandstanding for the affluent. To join the charmed circle one must; be tightfisted, avoid taxes, and possess a complete disregard for the less fortunate. These are among the many noble qualities recommended by our authors. Perhaps my interpretation was too literal, there may have been an underlying satire that I failed to interpret. Or, maybe I'm too sensitive to command such Machiavellian principles. Nevertheless, I found the book to be tacky and lacking in practicality. One should follow their dreams and stay true to their principles, and above all have compassion for the near-do-wells. Lest we all fall victim to the tsunami that results from greed and contempt."
5,"No Virginia, there is no Santa Claus","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you cherish the fantasy that""consume"" (or ""spend"") and ""accumulate"" are synonyms. You will not like the book. You will be throwing your money away. And if this book is accurate, you do not have any money to spare.BUY THIS BOOK if you habitually save more than 5% of your paycheck and need a pep-talk. This book will assure you that it is all worthwhile. You are not alone. Soldier on.BUY FIVE COPIES OF THIS BOOK if you know five young people and wish that you had started saving earlier in life. In American culture, the message to consume is pervasive and this book provides a weighty counterargumentObviously, I subscribe to the message in the book. For my part, I am extremely grateful to those who taught me the folk wisdom enshrined in The Millionaire Next Door. END"
3,But is it living?,"The basic principles endorsed by the MNDs (live below your means, save, invest, and don't waste your money on ostentation) are sound, and I agree that we'd all be better off if we followed them. On the other hand, there's nothing intrinsically admirable about being a millionaire, and it's possible to follow these principles and still be a scumbag. It's high time we in this country got over our focus on ""how much ___ you have"" and learned how to LIVE WELL -- and that has more to do with your attitude than your bank balance.To me, a good life includes meaningful work, solid relationships with your family and friends, participating membership in your community, a rich mental, emotional, and spiritual life, and a living situation that supports all of these. Some MNDs have these, and some don't. I'm far more interested in hearing about people who live well -- whatever the size of their bank balance -- than in many of the self-absorbed, money-obsessed misfits chronicled in this book."
3,Interesting but very repetitive and dry.,"This book was highly recomended by retirees several of which were prominent professionals and retirees who were examples of the ""PAWs'"" and ""UAW's"" described in great detail in the book. Although the infomration was well written, documented and substantiated, I found it to be most repetitive. For example, the charts and statistical summaries were more than adequate to provide a complete picture. To go into a blow by blow discription of all the same datat that was most self explanitory made the reading very repetitive ad dry. Even though the book explained the ""first"" gneration and ""second"" generation wealthy, it did not devote enough time or attention to the demographic changes facing our society. Many more seniors with or without accumulated wealth to adequately provide insight into where society is headed. Boom, Bust Echo by David Foote would have been a good cross refernce souce of information."
5,"It's not how much money you make, it's how much you spend","This book dispels the myth that most millionaires live an ostentatious lifestyle. Quite to the contrary. They became millionaires by living within their means. The book also drives home the point that it's not what you make, it's what you keep.It's too bad that there isn't a 6 star rating, because that's what this book deserves. It's that good.John White, Author of:""I'm in Debt, Over 40, with No Retirement Savings. HELP!""ISBN: 0974068748"
1,A great book...if you want to die without spending a cent,The same stuff over and over and over..... I will save you the trouble. If you want to be called a millionaire save all of your money / don't spend a dime. It sure does not allow you to enjoy the benefits of your wealth. What's the point if you cannot enjoy your wealth.
2,Every Chapter is the same,"You only have to read the 1st Chapter, because the rest of the book is the same. Don't spend any money and do not drive high priced cars"
3,A little disappointing,"Overall the book has some good points. It's more about teaching your kids good lessons about money than how to become a millionaire yourself. I can sum up the book in one sentence: Be frugal, save 15% of your income, buy used cars and teach your kids how to be independent money makers so you don't end up supporting them in your old age. These aren't really secrets. It reaffirms some of the ""tough"" decisions you need to make to become a millionaire."
2,"Useful advice, misleading conclusions","The gist of this book is that you should spend less than you earn. If this is a lesson you need to learn, then you should read this book.However, the idea that this book may help you on the pathway to riches, probably not. It is a compilation of statistics on existing millionaires, but it does not mean that trying to fit their mold will lead you to becoming a millionaire.Most people would like the freedom provided by wealth. The prototypical millionaire from the book does not seem to reap many of the benefits from their wealth. They live like normal middle class Americans. They work hard. They are tightwads and proud of it. If that is your goal, then this is the book for you.For a dramatically different strategy I would consider The 4-Hour Workweek, by Timothy Ferriss. Work less, enjoy life more. Don't worry about becoming a millionaire."
4,A little tedious but a good read.,"This book reads well but it is a little tedios. Many points could have been summarized and more real life examples could have been thrown in, to make it more interesting. Nevertheless, it was insightful and if you read it all, there are many lessons to be learnt. I think those that criticise the authors for suggesting one can become a millionaire at the risk of having no life are missing the essential point. The authors state that these millionaires, who made it by careful money management, are happy because they are financially independent. It is having that security which gives them happiness. So, if financial independence is what you desire the book tells you to modify your life in order to achieve it. If you don't want financial independence then don't read the book but be warned about your old age which could be a time when choices will be pretty limited."
5,Do you want to be wealthy? Read this book!,"I am a financial strategist. I spend most of my day teaching people how to save for their future. This book is changing my financial future, as well as the future of my clients. It is a profound look into the net-wealthy of america. Follow the easy outline and you too can become a PAW in this lifetime."
5,Everyone can be millionaires,"I was most perplexed by any less positive reviews posted on Amazon.com concerning this book. Regardless of the survey's generalizability, it SAMPLES the characteristics of the weathly, and suggests how others may do the same. True, it reaffirms well worn values and a 'common sense' approach to finances, but few texts provided data to support such hypothesis. You can read it sipping coffee at a bookstore and walk away with skills for a lifetime. If you don't already know it, read it. If you do, it reaffirms your track. If you disagree with its premises, then hopefully you are financially independent with money to spare. Spare cash, when net worths are measured in decamillions, translates to a relative frugality for a lifestyle of minimal superficiality."
3,Belabored Statement of the Obvious,The authors where on to something good and then they beat it to death. This could have been edited down to a nice pamphlet to be given out free in unemployment offices or inserted under windshield wipers at snooty hangouts. To it's credit the basic conservative truths are essential for people to understand no matter how self-servingly redundant the presentation. I did learn a valuable lesson from this bookcdon't judge a book by it's rise through the best seller list!
2,Life is for living.,"I am bothered by the entire premise of this book: that people would WANT to be millionaires. What is the point of having money if not to spend it to enjoy life? Of course, some amount of savings is ideal to lessen financial anxiety and to help in the event of an emergency, but we only live once. I certainly don't want to be like my grandfather who saved and saved and saved, never travelled or did anything interesting, then DIED. What is the point, indeed?"
1,Distorted cause and effect.,"There is a silly book called A Millionaire Next Door, and one of the authors wrote an even sillier book called The Millionaire's Mind. They interviewed a bunch of millionaires to figure out how these people got rich. Visibly they came up with bunch of traits. You need a little bit of intelligence, a lot of hard work, and a lot of risk-taking. And they derived that, hey, taking risk is good for you if you want to become a millionaire. What these people forgot to do is to go take a look at the less visible cemetery -- in other words, bankrupt people, failures, people who went out of business -- and look at their traits. They would have discovered that some of the same traits are shared by these people, like hard work and risk taking. This tells me that the unique trait that the millionaires had in common was mostly luck.By Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
1,I feel sorry for my dad who spent money on this book and the cost of shipping,"I seriously gave up on this book after 2 chapters and then skimmed the rest. I am 25 years old and 98% debt free and still found this book a complete waste of time. What did I learn? Don't spend money, live in a shack in the worst part of town due to my sub par income and never go outside if it looks dangerous. I feel sorry for my dad and him buying this book and then spending money on having to ship it to me. I would send it back to him but that wouldn't be saving my money and penny pinching.Time to turn on Swamp People and learn about real life living and gator hunting!"
2,A Waste of Time,"The whole book can be summed up in one phrase: save your money, be frugal and you too can be a millionaire. Really?!?! Although the studies are somewhat interesting the whole book seems to be a bunch of numbers that prove the same point in fifty thousand different ways. So, save your money. The authors do bring up a valid point when they say that most millionaires do not look and act the part of the ""Hollywood millionaire,"" but isn't that obvious? If you spend all of your income on expensive, frivolous, luxury items, of course you are not going to have enough left over to qualify as a millionaire. I guess the book is good to read if you are one of those people that are given everything from your parents. If you don't have a budget plan and are constantly buying the most expensive items, then maybe this book will ""change your life."" However, I would hope that what is mentioned in the book is common sense to most people. Save your money and save your time."
4,Common Sense is not so common,"Wow! I read the pro and con reviews preceding mine. My circle of friends had the same mixed reactions. Our conclusion: We still are working at being millionaires, getting closer all the time. One thing we refuse to become is either self centered or miserly, or miserable. Some of the codgers interviewed in this book need to loosen up a bit. Much of what was said in this book was better capsulized in the old tried and true ""The Richest Man in Babylon."" I would recommend it heartily to those in quest for riches of all kinds."
3,Borrow it from the Library,"This book has a great start, then it just repeats itself. What a waste of time. I agree that it would have made a great pamphlet or essay. Invest your $15 elsewhere and borrow your soon to be millionaire next door neighbors' book for a night."
2,Extremely repetitive...,"The book gives lots of interesting statistics about millionaires vs. non-millionaires at similar income levels, but basically repeats one concept paragraph after paragraph, page after page: People with high wealth have high income that they spend thriftily and invest well, while high wager earners with lower wealth than they should have spend outrageously on luxuries...what a surprise! For a chapter or two that might be an interesting theme, but this is almost the entirety of what the book has to say about ""millionaires."" There's a few useful tidbits about how these millionaires actually manage to be thrifty, but nothing too groundbreaking. A ten page version of this book could serve an identical function to its 300+ pages of rambling and statistics."
2,Just get to the point!,"The message of this book is very good - it's about being conservative with our wealth. However, I wish the authors were a bit more conservative with the use of their lengthy descriptions of esoteric points. It's as if somewhere along the way they said, ""why should we say in 10 words what we could say in 100,000?"" If they just got to the point you could read the whole book in about an hour."
3,carpe diem vs. saving,"Although simplistic and repetitive, I am glad that I read this book. The notion of deferring dollars and pleasures for a later day, is one I will gladly have repeated to me. It is a no-brainer for some people and I can see why there are one-stars given. I can also see why people rave about it...self-help sells.I think wisdom falls somewhere between the philiosophy of these authors and the carpe diem mentality. I probably lean towards the notion of saving, you can 'seize the day' without driving a new BMW."
3,Good information but too repetitive,"After hearing so much about the book from friends, I went to my public library and found 5 pristine copies of it (no one has checked them out). The information is interesting but I have the feeling that the authors try to milk a short subject into a book as they repeated the same message over and over (millionaires live below their means) and there are too many meaningless statistical tables included in the book. My recommendation, go to your local library and check it out rather than spending 14 bucks for a paper back."
5,"A great book, if mostly common sense","This book is common sense. Most millionaires(and others who can retire comfortably) do so because they live on a budget and don't spend every dollar that comes into their hands. If you have to have the biggest house and most expensive car you can afford to impress the neighbors, you'll never be rich. A simple lesson, but one most Americans aren't disiplined enough to follow."
5,If you want to know why you're NOT a millionaire read this!,"I have received great insight into why I need to change my consumption habits, and be more frugal and don't worry about living it up right now. By doing this, I will become financially independent in the future. Also, that it's not how much you make but how much you save that is really how you can tell where you stand."
3,Excellent advice for those who want financial independence.,"Gives a revealing account of who the wealthy in this country are and how they went about earning their financial independence. These millionaires live in middle class neighborhoods, drive inconspicuous autos, and eschew high consumption lifestyles. Interesting stuff; motivating."
5,"If you look like ""It"".... well, then we assume you have ""It""","I really enjoyed the book. It taught me lots and gave me a new insight. I jumped over some of the ""car by the pound stuff"" etc.It was interesting to know that there are many people who try to ""LOOK RICH"" and yet only have one to two months of salary in their savings. I now look different at the guy in the Porche with the expensive clothing and the watch to match it. Why? Well, because they most likely are UAWs (Under Acheivers of Wealth) trying to impress their neighbor,... you know,.... the neighbor with the construction truck in the driveway,... the Wealthy Guy!"
3,The Millionaire Next Door,"I would say that this book helped me think of ideas I have never thought about. These ideas and concepts could work with pretty much everybody, or so the book tells you. I even have started to put these concepts into practice, like saving my money from the beginning to reach a higher income and choosing the same quality goods and services for a lower amount of money/price. Stanley and Danko tells the readers that the only way to succeed is to follow the 7 basic principles. It does not apply to everyone, even though this book tells you so. In this way, it is biased. I would only recommend this book to those who truly wants to be a millionaire and who would use the secrets in this book of becoming one."
3,"Some interesting facts, but repetitious","The book started out good (interesting, unexpected information), but went downhill after the first few chapters. The authors talked about how millionaires buy a car AD NASEUM. Gee, how many chapters can they devote to car buying? The ""advice"" in the book was common sense that we all know, but may just need to be reminded about from time to time. Save your money, live below your means, etc., etc. Although I looked forward to reading it, this book was a disappointing"
1,"Redundant, Boring, No Useful Information","""Live below your means"". That is the key to how all the millionaires interviewed made their money(not by winning the lottery or big businesses.) Now that you know that, I am sure you can figure out how to live below your means. First up - check this book out of the library for free, like I did."
1,Can be summed up in one sentence.,"Rich people are cheap and invest most of their money. THAT'S IT! If you want read a 250-page extrapolation of that one sentence read the book. Honestly, though, after reading the first sentence of this review, you basically have read the book without looking at any boring charts. Save your time, and skip this book."
1,Misses the Point,"The problem with this book is that the authors take data about millionaires' spending habits and mold it into a recipe for acquiring wealth. Of course, frugality is key. But whether or not you choose Timex over Rolex, or Buick over BMW is much less important than investing money wisely. And this book does not cover investment concepts like portfolio management and diversification. Furthermore, the reason many of the so-called wealthy are frugal, middle-of-the-road spenders is that their incomes are modest, five-figure salaries, and their net worth conists largely of stocks and other holdings. In other words, these individuals often don't have enough disposable income to be considered truly wealthy and spend voraciously. If the authors at least discussed the ""greatest invention of the 20th century"" (acc. to Einstein-compound interest-the book might be useful for those looking to start building a retirement nest."
5,Dry but still entertaining,"This book was dry but still very good. I liked the examples, and the overall book did raise some very good questions. I thought it was a compelling read, one which helped me consider my own relation to wealth."
3,Interesting research of millionaires,"I found this book interesting. It gives you an ample view of the behaviors that US millionaires have, however, most of this characteristics applies to other cultures."
4,Very informative,"This book contains the study results of several years and numerous interviews of individuals pertaining to how they became millionaires and their past and present life styles. The book is very revealing and yet the formula for becoming a millionaire is nothing new. It is just that these folks were very dedicated to a conservative life style. They do not spend more than they make, they save a certain percent of their earnings, they don't live in fancy houses, drive fancy cars or wear fancy clothing. They are very hard workers and incorporate all of the practical advice we have heard all of our lives. This book is easy to read but powerful in it's contents."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"This is an all time great book for any person that desires financial success. It is most likely that by the time you reach half the book, your income and impact soars.By Wilbert R. Mutoko - Author 15 Secrets for Personal Financial Success - A Simple Step-by-Step Plan for Financial Freedom."
5,Want to be wealthy?,"Then you need to get this book. It is highly important. Read it and apply it, and you will be on the road to success."
1,250 pages one concept. Waste of time.,"250 pages of spend less than you earn and you will become rich.Every single concept in this book was obvious. If you are mentally capable of buying this book, then you already know all the ideas inside it.I was hoping for real interviews with people who had become successful in life.The author seemed to have access to so many people and yet basically asked do you spend less than you earn.This book was a total waste of time."
5,You are closer to becoming a millionaire than you think!,"Wow! What great insights, as backed by years of analytical detail. Who would have thought that MOST millionaires are just look like you and I on the outside. They live normal lives, perhaps even more frugal than us at times. But yet, they have mastered the art of saving. I learned that it does not matter how much money you make, it is how much money you have that matters. I recommend this book to anyone with the dream of retiring with millions.....but be ready, you likely need to start making changes right now."
2,Would have made an excellent pamphlet,"This book makes about 10 very interesting an insightful points. However, it then beats you over the head with the same point for about 30 pages before it moves on.For example, the vast majority of millionaires never inherited any money. This point can be stated and then expanded on as to why this was helpful in making someone a millionaire and why it might hinder some others. It warrants a good couple of paragraphs, maybe a page or two to get into the details. But this book will drag it on for 30 more pages, giving repetitive examples to dumb it down yet another way for us.By about half way through this book, I had lost the will to become rich and almost the will to live. Then I found the answer, read the first two pages of each section, then skim on to the end of the examples and read the summary. Then next chapter please. You will be through it in no time and will have learnt plenty without being patronised."
3,Well written but somewhat boring,"Before everyone kills me, let me say, I think this book is good. The only problem that I have with it is that it (and The Millionaire Mind) gets so bogged down with statistical information that I had a hard time finishing it. It is an interesting read in regards to the people that it is written about; the average drink beer from a can, own a small business, pay cash instead of finance, millionaires that people see everyday and don't realize it. It offers hope and a great perspective that financial intelligence and some will power goes along way towards long term security. I just felt that there was a lot of information overload in the text."
3,"Dated, but helpful","I had always heard about this book and was eager to finally read it. Unfortunately it was somewhat disappointing. The data is getting dated. The message, while sound, is so oft repeated that it gets a little boring. However, I enjoyed very much the passages dealing with how to (or more accurately - how not to) handle wealth issues and transfers with children. Overall it is a book everyone should read, but I wish they would release a newer edition with more recent data, etc."
4,Millionaires who dont care about their social status,"The book gives very good insihgts about who the real millionaire people are;however,it does not care about their social status.I believe the authors did not include millionaires who live a more realistic life without going broke.I mean the ones who buy expensive things for a purpose. for ejample:to show their good taste, economic progress, just to feel good etc."
1,"Start saving now, Do Not buy this book","An entire book to tell you that no matter how littls you earn, if you live like a bum, you can have a million dollars by the time you are in your mid 50s. Ever been divorced? You won't make it. Lived in more than one house? Forget it. Live outside of the hood? Give up now. Thats the just of it. Now go buy a book worth reading."
3,"Just have discipline,desire and dedication","This book point out what type of life millioaire live.However it criticize high income and educated people.You don't have to be a bum to be a millionaire be a dotor pay off your loan buy a home with in your means have no debt and invest a proportion of your income.It's that simple.You don't have to be afraid to make 200,000 a year or be a ""ball player"" just don't be a constance consumer,save more then you spend(maybe I should write a book. lol)"
2,The Millionaire Next Door,"Product was rated online as 'new condition, but condition is somewhat worn in appearance, dirty."
3,"Statistical Methodolgy ""Questionable"" but good Anecdotes","I like the book in general, but hated the ending. On the VERY LAST PAGE, (the 3rd to last sentence) the authors state ALL their statistical evidence is based on the results from surveys of only 385 ""Millionaire families"". 385! Do you have any idea of the statistical inaccuracies that can result from such a small sample group? No wonder they buried this piece of information. It would be like a political pollster asking people of conservative area a question, then stating that's how all Americans felt. Plus the way they use the statistics only help to confuse the reader, not make their point.Their anecdotal evidence is much better. There is a lot to learn from the stories they tell. As a whole, I liked the book. But I never like it when authors try to slip one past me."
2,Repetitive. Brilliant if was a 5-page article,"This is another interesting book that could have been a 5 to 10-page brilliant article. Repetitive to the extreme, the authors go on and on and on and on...But I am glad I read this book.There is only one issue I wish was addressed. Being frugal and living below your means is good. After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes. However, there MUST be a balance in life. What is the point of having money if it is not to spend? Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth?I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book. Instead, it looks like the ""pursuit of wealth"" is a constitutional obligation of every citizen."
4,Why Isn't This All Common Sense?,"Stanley and Danko, after interviewing dozens of people who have accumulated millions of dollars of wealth (some never having had an annual salary over $75,0000), show readers the steps to true financial independence and wealth-building. These are primarily living ""below one's means,"" developing thrifty savings habits, and instilling similar habits in one's children.Sadly, most people mistake high income for wealth -- the authors illustrate how frequently those making high incomes amass remarkably little wealth in savings and investments, while many making far less can be worth many times their annual salary (and therefore are less susceptible to financial hardship)! The difference is the way the two groups spend and save their money.Though short on actual steps to correcting poor financial habits, the book does a great job of illustrating the general path to wealth accumulation. Truly, this book should be recommended reading for everyone."
4,Dont expect a Get-Rich Quick manual,"I think this book is great for the people who are decticated to saving their money and finding the best ways to move up in their repected jobs. Anyone one seeking the Get-Rich quick methods needs to find another book. This book goes very in depth, step by step breakdown on what the best ways are to save your money, it also teaches how to seek out good advice, and where to seek out good advice when making important money decisions and investsments."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I agree with many of the statements and opinions given in this book, like how the rich live below their means even though they have the opportunity to splurge on everything they want. I felt, however, that the information was redundant and slightly boring. When I chose this book in the first place, I thought it might be an interesting look into the high-income world of flashy cars and mansions. Instead, it turned out to be a relatively bland account with the same ideas repeated over and over in different ways. I'm just not a fan of this book, although the ideals and rules for richness seem relevant and attainable."
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"I bought this book because of its catchy title and it's track record as a long term bestseller. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the worse book I ever read! The only thing I find interesting in the book is the statistics on the financial state and the purchasing habits of the American public. Unfortunately, the authors' interpretation on the data are often, in my opinion, incorrect. If you look carefully, the text portion of the book often incorrectly interpretate data presented in the tables and different parts of the book often contradict. The main theme of the book is to never spend a dollar so you can save up a million dollars in your bank account. I personally don't see the appeal working hard all my life, never enjoy the money I earned, just to have 6 zeros in my bank account. I think most of us want to be a millionaire AND to enjoy the reward that money can bring us."
4,A tool for every fundraiser,"As a fundraiser, i have to discriminate between potential donors to maximize the return on my time. This book helps identify those people who may not look or act like it but who have millions.Like my gandfather said ""there's more money in overalls than in 3-piece suits""."
2,Vapid Dribble,"Well after reading the introduction and the first two chapters, throw the book away. After the first couple of chapters all the book does is repeat ideas the reader has already been informed of the book should be fifty pages, and not 250!"
2,The best way...,"The best way to get rich is to write a book on the best way to get rich.Education is a poor investment, with little return. Buying a book is an investment in education, one with little or no return. Thus buying a book is a poor investment. Thus, the authors are calling you, the reader, gullible for buying their book in the first place, contrary to the advice in the book.Furthermore there is a stark difference of contrast between earning 150k dollars a year and living well below your means and earning 30k dollars a year and living well below your means.This book is about two steps up from sales hype, and they're not very big steps."
2,Meh.,I was not impressed with this book. It didn't tell me anything that I did not already know and some of the things written I just flat out disagreed with. I would recommend Robert Kiyosaki's books instead.
2,Boring...,"If this book got summarized in a Newspaper article, it would have been acceptable.But it was a long boring book, that I could not finish..! In summary this books talks about certain Millionaires (who are a majority by the way) who made their furtune by being cheap!"
1,Empty! [check that...] Full of useless observations!,"I was completely disappointed with the lack of any real content! Sure, I was myself fooled by glancing at its first few pages (at Borders! You don't do that, do you! :) But it's only a collection of trivial observations. The author adds no real information other than boring statistics in an attempt to dress up the pages and add a sense of authority! There's no real added insight into psychology, finance, or anything else of substance."
2,Profiling and Finding a Wife,"The author in this second book of the Millionaire series offers up some new interesting insights about wealthy people and thier ways. Unfortunately he maintains his bias against working folks read ""economic dropouts"" and this time there is a lamentable self-congratulatory tone. I would like to see a book that looks at wealthy people from every segment of society and every economic background. This book is written for middle to upper middle class white college educated people who perhaps have money problems. I strongly suspect the author has little use for any other kind of people hence the pejorative ""economic dropout"". If the potential reader fits the above described profile and wants to get married then this book might be a good read. This time I was smart and checked it out from the library."
3,"Lifestyle separates ""haves"" from ""have-nots""","This book is chock-full of details that make up the lifestyle of those who succeed at accumulating wealth, as opposed to ""earning"" lots of money. They are contrasted against the habits of over-consumption of those who perhaps, gross more, but clearly fail at the bottom line.At its best you get a clear picture of how the simple choices we make separate us between have and have-nots, although some of those specifics are quite repetitive..."
2,not worth the money,"I can sum up the advice given this book in one sentence. Make good money working and be frugal. Sure, its interesting to know most millionaires don't live the flashy lifestyle we're taught to believe they do, but I'm not a doctor that can afford to save tens of thousands of dollars a year either...good to know that there are some millionaires out there that are smart and know how to hold onto their money. It's pretty common sense if you're already in that type of financial position."
2,audio tape - finances,"hey if getting rich is your bag, this although outdated cassette version may be for you, but you might not like what they have to say. Rarely does one get rich quick. its still applicable (if not too rigid) and has some good things or worth to get out of it."
4,There's a simple rule to become wealthy,"For many years, since I got my first job, I thought I was never get out of debt(Student Debt) if I couldn't get a higher income job. But I was wrong, as I got better paid jobs I got bigger debt, then I found the answer, in part thanks to this book. The rule is fiscal discipline, never spend more than your paycheck and always have a savings goal."
3,Applies to only a small percentage of the N.A. pop.,"This book is a great statistical analysis of affluent people; however, it does not factor in qaulity of life, morals, or values of the millionaires it uses as examples in the book."
4,An eye opener,"This book dispels many of the myths about who the wealthy are in America and how they live. We all know that movie stars, rock stars and ballplayers are atypical, but this books shows you just how atypical they are, even among the wealthy. If you think the typical millionaire thinks and dresses and eats like those featured on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, you will be very surprised by the facts presented in this book. I certainly was. Only 4 stars because the material could have been presented better."
1,REPETITIOUS AND BORING,"Live below your means to accumulate wealth. WOW what a revelation. This book then repeats this thought for 250 PAGES! So obvious and boring from repetition I didn't bother finishing it. I only wish there was a ""0 star"" rating. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,The same three thoughts over and over and over,"How many times can you say, the millionaire next door doesn't drive a new car, wear an expensive watch, live in an expensive house and his wife clips coupons. Oh, what they forgot to say was these people are BORING!!! Hey there is a big world out there, live a little!!"
2,"Took a whole book to say ""don't spend any money and look for bargains when you do.""","Having money is not an end, it's a means to an end. Yes, you can collect more and more money by not spending any, and it's certainly a good idea to avoid borrowing money that you're charged interest for, but the point of having money is not merely to *have* money...it's to be able to *spend* (and yes, sometimes *enjoy*) the money you have."
2,Dislike,"I thought I'd be getting some really good insight into the lifestyles of the ""invisibly wealthy."" But what I got was the exact same message, dozens of times over, with dozens of similar studies & statistics. Save yourself the time. The main takeaway here: Be frugal, save, invest. (Duh.)"
2,Could fit into about 10 pages....,"There is really no reason for this book to be as long as it its. Not that it is incredibly long, but the whole book could easily be summed up in less than 10 pages. It is very repetitive, and chalked full of filler, explaining the same thing over and over again.Here's my one sentence summary of the book:The typical millionaire owns their own business, is married, drives a used car, lives well below their means, and is very modest with their wealth.The whole point of the book is to explain that the typical millionaire does not live like Donald Trump. I guess it is geared for people who have never thought about that concept before? Other than generating a book to sell, I can't see why it would take so many pages to explain this fact."
3,"Old material, not updated as advertised","This book was supposed to be updated. It wasn't, the examples and stats were years, if not decades old. Disappointing read."
5,Enjoyed the read and practical advise!,"Enjoyed the read and the analysis on Millionaires.The emphasis on being frugal, frugal & frugal couldn't have been put in better words. The author quotes statistics on several choices wealthy Americans make and the wisdom behind them- ""Big hat No cattle"" to ""I'm my best charity"" book is amusing and insightful. The key is working towards financial independence and making tough life style changes. Caveat: Its not a ""how to"" book"
4,Some good lessons,"Some good tips about how to accumulate wealth, and details on some traits many millionaires have in common. Nothing extraordinarily surprising."
5,Must read for those looking to acquire wealth,"The only book I've read about money that's worth the paper its printed on. Changed the way I look at money and what I spend it on. Makes you feel better about driving your pedestrian passenger car and living in your middle class neighborhood. My favorite part of the book is the study that shows the top two credit cards owned by millionaires are JCPenny and Sears! Who would have guessed? The book does get a little repetitive, but it really drives the point home. The only way to become wealthy is to be thrifty and invest! If you haven't ordered this book yet do it now, it will probably change your life."
5,Everyone should read this,Reminds us of all the common sense approach to money and living that we forget. I consider myself a sensible person but was reminded of a lot of things I lose sight of. Easy read too.
3,"Your millionaire neighbor is frugal, frugal, frugal.","This book is redundant, redundant, redundant. I kept thinking that I lost my place and was re-reading the same pages. However, high-income earners who can't save 15% of their salary should read this."
2,True and boring,A good book that could have included the concepts in about 3 pages. Put me asleep on an overseas flight.
4,"A good book, but missed an opportunity","I enjoyed reading MND, but found little new information. It solidly reinforced everything I have read in various financial planning books and magazines and would be great for someone not on the wealth track. What I found to be missing, and would have been farily easy to gather given all of the interviewing done, was some spending data. Granted, they talk about cars, clothes and watches, but what does the typical millionaire's budget look like. The book does indicate the majority of millionaires use a budget, so where are they spending what little money they spend. A couple of the wordy tables could have been replaced with some actual budgets and some budget statistics from the population of millionaires. I still enjoyed the book and will encourage my UAW acquaintances to read it. (funny thing about UAWs, they tend not to read books like this!)"
5,If you were to buy just one financial book....,"Make it The Millionaire Next Door. Fans of 1,000 page+ fluffy books written by magazine authors with no financial credentials will not like this book. Former Nixonites who take cheap shots at the rich and attack without basis or fact and write stupid books will not enjoy this book either. Nor will spendthrifts. The get rich quickies won't enjoy this book either.If you are like me and are looking for a proven program that really works and has been explicitly researched, then this book is for you.Tony Robbins talks about modeling. If youw ant to be rich, doesn't it make sense to model the rich? This book and The Millionaire Mind shows you how the rich think and how they become rich.And unlike some other books, there is no fluff here. It does take discipline though and discipline is tough.Also recommend Awaken The Giant by Tony Robbins and More Wealth Without Risk by Charles J. Givens."
5,Stop Everything! YOU ARE NOT RICH!,"How do you know if this book is for you? If you define ""rich"" as any of the following, then please read this book NOW!- Driving expensive cars- Living in a mansion- Membership to the country club- Owning lots of toys (boats, jet ski's, etc..)- Taking frequent vacation on expensive cruises- Wearing name brand clothing you bought at full retail...- You get the ideaIf I learned nothing else from this book, it's that the one-and-only TRUE test of wealth is how you answer this question:If your income were to stop today, how long could you continue your current life style?If you can honestly answer ""decades"" then congratulations! You are rich! If your like most people and would have to answer ""about 3 weeks"" then you had better purchase this book.Enjoy!"
5,I plan to buy this for several relatives for the holidays.,Many people forget that this book says in the beginning that it interviews the millionaires. This is basically a statistical average of how many people in this country got to be wealthy. One critic says Bill Gates did not become rich by pinching pennies. Well he did not start out rich. He got there by using his money wisely. This book is about what people do to spend money wisely. It has started to change my habits. I am now looking at used cars instead of new. These little things make a difference. I do not use credit cards to fund my hobbies. I actually save now instead of pay debt. In ten years at the rate I am going I will be financially secure to the point of retiring. This book is not about the most outspoken rich but about the average person who does not waste money on trinkets. A person could learn a lot just by understanding why the people in this book are better off than the reader.
5,"A Motivational, Goal-setting Book","If you intend to read this book to discover the ""get rich"" secrets for becoming a millionaires, you are reading the wrong book!If you are searching for a book that helps you define your goals for saving and investing for retirement, children's education, etc., this is the right book. Before you can sit down and develop a savings plan, you must have goals including an idea of what you are willing to sacrifice to obtain those goals.Exactly how you will aquire wealth is between you and your accountant, banker, financial planner, broker, or whoever you trust with these matters. Everybody's formula will be a little different.This is not a ""how-to"" book. It is a book that gives you the courage to save through illustrations of what you can accomplish by saving and what you loose by spending every dime you earn."
2,This book is not worth buying.,"I thought this book could have been done in one chapter.I own this book. The main things this book points out to you are:1. The average millionaire get rich by owning a business2. They are very frugal and save every penny.3. They want their children to be a doctor, lawyer or other high paying professions because they know how hard it is to survive in the business they are in.Throw in a bunch of statistics and you have the book called ""The Milionaire Next Door""Now that you have already read everything the book has to offer, don't buy it."
5,A friend recommended this to me,"I wasn't sure that I was going to like this book, not from the title but more from the first chapter. It's very data heavy, so it's something you've got to be willing to get through. If you go with the highlights, it does make a compelling argument for how to help yourself and your children learn the discipline of earning, saving and spending- in that order."
4,Excellent advice,"This book is getting dated, but the message is solid and very useful in todays world of over-spenders. Stories of how common people living within their means, save money and become millionaires. The approach to how money is viewed is critical. Don't waste money and don't spend money you don't have and don't worry about ""keeping up with the Jones."" The long section on cars is a little over done, but this is important as so many people borrow money to purchase a vehicle. This is a bad investment - actually it is not investment, but a money pit. Yet due to the widespread purchasing of new and expensive vehicles by so many people, I guess this needs to be stressed. Myself, I very much like nice cars, especially Porsches, but I only buy what I can afford to purchase with cash. Again, this is a very useful read, especially for young people who want to become wealthy."
2,The Millionaire Next Door,I felt too much emphasis was placed on charting and statistics. Not enough was stated about how to really save money. My children can remember 4 different meals from a cheap 7-bone beef roast. I guess I expected reporting of extreme economizing so I was disappointed in the contents overall in 'The Millionaire Next Door'.
5,Must read but can be a little repetitive,I feel this book is a must read for young professionals like myself...great book and gave great insight into who truly is a millionaire. I will recommend!
5,nice addition,"the kindle makes this a great addition.i like reading and this book is one to have..use it,try it,,learn from it"
4,Enjoyed this classic.,"I enjoyed this book. I found the information relevant and useful. I found the writing to be a bit long winded at times, or clearly common sense, but still some of the anecdotes were interesting. I don't think it will be for everyone unfortunately I think certain people who already know this information will find the book redundant, and people who don't know it will be critical of the ideas so does it really do a lot? Well for those who need guidance on the path to growing their wealth it might be useful otherwise you probably already know this or you don't care."
4,interesting,I'd recommend this book to someone who needs some motivation to be more frugal and less materialistic.
3,Getting into the mind of the successful,"The book does get into the mind of the rich, buth they were too disparate or only just millionaires to be able to help much.I found the Mind of a Trader (1998), which interviews some of the world's most succesful and wealthy traders who went from zero to tens or even hundreds of millions mor helpful."
3,I was at a party the other night ...,"Ever meet someone at a party who has an interesting subject to discuss? You join in the discussion and you are impressed with the depth with which the person knows his topic and the clarity with which he presents it. An hour into the conversation, you realize the person is repeating himself, but adding a few more interesting points along the way. The second hour you realize the person is just plain repeating himself. Now the party is breaking up and you a) realize you already knew a lot of what the person told you, and b) are really annoyed that you didn't talk to others at the party.This book was a lot like that."
5,"Add this title to your carts as a ""MUST READ"" selection NOW!","Want to know how millionaires act, what they wear, how they got there? READ THIS BOOK! This is an enlightening, entertaining, and yes - educational book. Using it patiently as a guidebook, you, too could become a millionaire, and enjoy the journey getting there"
4,FRUGAL SPENDING HABITS WILL RESULT IN WEALTH ACCUMULATION,"THIS BOOK GIVES GOOD INSIGHT INTO THE LIFESTYLES OF AMERICA'S RICH. IT LETS THE WORLD KNOW THAT THE TYPICAL MILLIONAIRE IS NOT WHAT WE THINK: A SELF-INDULGENT INDIVIDUAL WHO FLAUNTS HIS WEALTH. RATHER, THE AVERAGE MILLIONAIRE IS SOMEONE WHO IS THRIFTY, HARD-WORKING, AND FRUGAL. THERE IS ONE PROBLEM THAT I HAD WITH THIS BOOK: THE AUTHORS SPEND TOO MUCH TIME DRIVING HOME THE POINT THAT FRUGAL SPENDING HABITS ARE WHAT LEAD TO WEALTH ACCUMULATION. THIS IS A GOOD POINT,BUT IT IS STATED TOO MANY TIMES"
4,One of a few nice tools to live a better life.,"Goes into great detail on how to live a simpler and frugal lifestyle. Basically, trying to keep up with the Jones' next door really does not matter. However, I believe they also should have addressed how to build your current wealth to enjoy lifes ultimate pleasures (like flying). I will use this for budget purposes, but still want a higher quality of life that money can only bring"
4,What about AAW?,"The book was good, however it talked too much about the extremes of being either a PAW OR a UAW. They'll probably write another book about being a AAW."
2,"Yes, You Too can Be a Millionaire if you live like a Pauper","Great. These people have money, but what else? Do you really want to sit around with a fat bank account while you live and work like a pauper? Personally, I find these people to be hopelessly boring - constantly watching every damn penny and obsessed with their ""net worth"".I'm a doctor, and I see people die all the time. And they don't take anything with them except perhaps regrets for what was left undone. No one has ever told me that they wished they had worked just a little more...I'd rather use up my money and enjoy life rather than having the cold comfort of being a ""millionaire""."
2,Book's message: Accumulate wealth & never spend any of it,"This book is a double edged sword. On one hand it offers some unique insight into the lives of millionaires and their buying habits and gives some practical (if unoriginal) suggestions: don't buy an expensive house, car (especially), watch, suit; live below your means, don't spoil your kids. But on the other it never really focuses on enjoyment of money. It seems that all these unlikely millionaires do is accumulate wealth to accumulate wealth. Is that the message being presented here? I'm all for wealth through practicality but the millionaires interviewed have worked all their lives and have millions to show for it but what else? Most disturbing quote in the entire book: ""If your goal is to become financially secure, you'll likely attain it...But if your motive is to make money to spend money on the good life,...you're never going to make it."" What is their definition of the good life? Being the richest person in the cemetery?"
4,Dickensian Philosphy in Action,"""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery"": David Copperfield, ch. 12 (Mr Micawber). This is a somewhat oversimplied summary of the central thesis of The Millionaire Next Door.Yes, the book is rather repetitive. Yes, the chart about the weights of various cars is silly. And yes, there are no amazing insights or foolproof ""get rich quick"" ideas. BUT: the authors make perfectly valid points, and the book is an easy, interesting read. There are many, many worse financial books out there."
2,Boring - Boring - Nothing new here - Save your money,Be frugal - save your money - spend less than you earn - do not become house rich and cash poor - use taxes to help you get rich. This is not an interesting book that has any insight that hasn't been written about numerous times over and over. Let me help you be frugal and put you on the road to being the millionaire in your town. Save your money and your time and invest them in something more useful - which is anything but this book.
2,A good guide on tips of how to save and manage,I didn't like the book at all. I thought it was a book that tells you HOW to make some money. All it did was tell me ABOUT people who were wealthy. No tips on how to become wealthy. I want something that I could use in real life. I found it boring and a waste of time.
2,Book falls short,"I applaud the book for restating, at least implicitly, that the more-is-better assumption to living life is a fallacy. After all, the hallmark of the frugal life style is that more is not necessarily better at all. I prefer the approach that there is something called ""enough"" that we all need to find out for ourselves. I think a much better read on this subject is ""Your Money or Your Life"", by Vickie Robin and Joe Dominguez. This latter book gets to the core of the issue far better than the Millionaire Next Door. Kudos to all who did not pay to read this book - who borrowed it from the library."
2,Redundant AND Repetitive,"Although the theme is interesting and instructive, the book is rather repetitive. Live below your means. Be frugal to accumulate wealth. The book could have been condensed into a 20 page essay. If you want to live the lesson, do what I did...borrow the book from the library"
5,Changed the way I think about money,I've read many investing and financial planning books and this has had far more impact on the way I handle my money that anything else. Through real statistical analysis the authors dispel countless myths about who becomes and stays financial secure and why.I read this book about 5 years before writing this review and it still affects my financial decisions. Really happy that I read this before the downturn in the economy!
4,Always wanted to know?,"I always wanted to know how and why so many people look, act and live like millionaires, now I know. Coming home from a business trip I found this book in the airport and read it on the plane. I liked this book because it opens your eyes to the fact that there are really very few true millionaires and many pretenders.Can you say DEBT...I don't want to give away the whole book because its interesting but that just about sum's it up for me. I enjoyed it, some good factual information."
3,Nice Read but Unrealistic for Today's World,"Many of us work extrememly hard and have sacrificed a great deal in order to live a better quality of life (vacation, nice home, car, etc.). Although I appreciate the underlying thesis of this book, there is no way that I would live like a pauper so that I can die with a few million in the bank, so the Goverment can take it away in estate taxes. It makes no sense. Yes, we should live sensibly, but unless you give yourself the opportunity to enjoy a few of the finer things in life, why work at all? So, get the book, appreciate what these people have done to earn their wealth and then go out and buy a Rolex! Put the extra in a good mutual fund"
2,Boring!!!,"Although this book encouraged me to accumulate wealth myself,I found it very boring.It basically says on almost 300 pages what you could say in 3 short sentences:To be weahlty you have to be frugal.The rich are not necessarily wealhty.To be weahlty do not spend any money.The whole book only tries to demonstrate how this is true in sometimes very controverse ways.Don't buy it!"
3,Good just basic book,"This is just a good basic theory book about saving more, spending less on frivolous items. Basically, that most millionaires don't live these high spending lifestyles, they buy used cars and pay cash for everything. Which is great, these guy live like blue collar America. If that is the case then why bother having millions to begin with the ex-wife is going to take half anyways. I think you should live a little never know when you can get run over by a bus. This book offers little to no financial advise just general themes. If I wanted to live like middle america I don't need to read a book about it instead I have a feeling the money I spent on this book will be going into the authors millionaire account."
2,We all know we have to save money to get rich!,"The book goes on for about 250 pages talking about how you have to save all of your extra money and invest it in bank accounts to become rich. Well, I think we all knew that saving money was a good thing and we didn't have to read 250 pages to get this. But the book did have some better things to offer. There were some great stories about people that we can al relate to in our lives, the eccentic neighbor, ect., that are all know as millionairs. They have saved up enough assets and have not splurged on anything to the point of becoming millionairs. And it is amazing to see all of the little places where they manage to save money. Maybe only a hundred dollars here, a hundred there, it all adds up and they accumulate for themselves a forturne. This is very interesting and a great way to learn the little things we can do in our lives to save money. Other than that, the book was really bad."
1,Way too repetitve,"Common sense people. You spend less, and you'll have more money saved than the guy who spends more. Or you can write a book stating the obvious and garner enough money to spend more.It's also funny how the authors state that millionares can't be found and then proceed to provide us with surveys from ""millionaire neighborhoods"". Funny really."
1,Not recomended at all,"I love to read books about millionaries, but this is the worst I have ever read. The book has a lot of chapters but at the end the conclussion of every chapter is to be frugal. Frugal its all they talk about. Dont read this book its a waste of time."
1,Not what i was looking for..,"This book was written based from research that was conducted through the usage of surveys that were taken in 1995. They basically accumulated information from 1000 american millionaires regarding their methods of house-hold finance, behavior, spending habits etc. Simply an analysis of the American millionaire demograhpic in the year 1995. No practical wisdom. Useless info in becoming wealthy.The whole book could've been summed up to: ""be modest, cheap, and save as much as possible"".IN CONCLUSION: If you're looking to learn to make more income, save your money and time, this one sucked. If you want a lesson in history, go right ahead."
1,I would give this book Zero stars if I could!,"This book was terrible - a magazine article made into a book as another reviewer mentioned. Basically they tell you to live below your means, and to save every penny you can by purchasing used cars, houses in middle class neighborhoods, buying cheap clothing, etc. The basic advice is good (a la Dave Ramsey), but it could have been presented better.Beyond being frugal, they didn't tell you how these millionaires invested their money, or how they handled charitable contributions, or anything like that. They basically repeated over and over to be frugal, save money, teach your kids how to be frugal and save money, and that was it. Plus they threw in many hard to read charts...."
4,A perspective changer...,"The authors have some very good points. They do a good job of drawing the distinction between those with wealth and those that live as though they have wealth. Further, the book goes into the decision making process to think as an accumulator of wealth.This is not a get rich book, this is a book to shape the reader's thinking to be more like the rich. The section on Economic Outpatient Care and advice on how to deal with children and assets after death was especially insightful.Once you get the basics, it can be slightly repetitive, as many academic texts are."
4,Change the way you think about money,"If you want to change the way you think, this book is a must read for anyone seeking to view life differently when it come to taking control your finances, and becoming financially independent."
5,A must read,"I buy this book for my friends to read and enjoy. This work is based on statistical analysis of data about the habits of people who have accumulated wealth through hard work and entreprenureship. The data have been filtered and very well presented. This NOT a cheesy ""how to get rich"" book. Highly recommend his other book ""The millionaire's Mind"""
2,Not much for the money.,"I thought the book would divulge some secrets that we normal people wouldn't know. The ideas expressed are mostly common sense things most of us already know. For example, don't buy new cars, only buy quality used vehicles since someone else has already suffered the depreciation. Some minor tips on how to save money, but they should have told us how to save $21.50 by not buying this book. Put the $21.50 in your money market and get a good financial advisor or planner."
3,"Good, not great.","The title is the best part of book. Using lots of tables and statistics, the book describes a group of millionaires who do not act like millionaires. This makes it somewhat dry and dull, with many facts repeated in different parts of the book. The bent is towards extremely frugal individuals. I think it spends too much time on people that make $50,000 a year but cut every corner to accumulate wealth. I never find out why they stash away all their money, it never seems to be enjoyed? I question the logic of saving every penny until you die just to boast that your net worth is over a million dollars.I read Rich Dad, Poor Dad and found it much more compelling. It offers a practical approach to making money work for you."
3,The Millionaire Next Door,"I did not feel that reading this book was a waste of my time, because it was a fast read and had caught my attention several times. I do feel that by reading this book I am walking away with something I had not thought about before. The reason why I am giving this book only 3 stars is because I often felt that it was repetative. There were chapters in this book that appeared identical and I could not tell the difference between them. Overall I would recommend this book as a fast read to anyone who has a few extra hours on their hands."
4,Surprising,This book was very surprising to read because it contradicts the sterotypical role of the millionaire.
3,A Good Reminder,"The writing is dry, sometimes difficult, and the charts and tables nearly impossible to understand. Practical advice is nowhere to be found. Yet everyone who isn't a millionaire and never believed they could be should read this book. I grew up in a working class home, often feeling inferior to those who had more than me. Now I find out that my background can actually tip the scales of wealth in my favor. It's good, too, to see in print evidence that many of the people I'm trying to keep up with on the way to the bank probably didn't earn their status the way I've had to; it was given to them instead. Highly motivating."
2,just read the introduction,so the message is fine. people who spend all their money won't accumulate wealth no matter how high their income. the authors pretty much repeated this over and over until they decided they had enough to call a book.just read the introduction and save yourself $9. there is no other info in the book.
2,Not worth much,"The entire presentation is about living under your means as a way to build wealth. This goes without saying. It does not offer strategies or techniques in doing so and really applies only to the upper class who can build wealth by living frugally. After listening to it you think, ""ok, yeah that makes sense"" but then you say, ""ok, what do I do next""? Everybody already knows to save money. Simply not worth it."
1,PAW/UAW vs AAW,"While reading this book I was wondering why there was so little mention of Average Accumulators of Wealth(AAW). Only the extremes were emphasized. Like our society, are AAW's as numerous as the middle class?This book only tells us about PAW's and their friendless, miserly, unsociable, tunnel-visioned lives and their extravagant, wasteful, egomanic UAW counterparts! Surely there must be happy, reasonable, generous(to a fault), scrupulous, venturesome AAW's out there.For books like these, I imagine that we the AAW's, are too boring and are not good cannon fodder.Ironically, we are the ultimate supporters of any UAW's who end up on the dole or close to it, in their retirement years. After all, those PAW's won't help. They're too busy planning to stuff their cash in (good used)luggage to put on top of their hearse limos."
1,A truly horrible book.,Repetitious and insubstantial. One of the few books I have ever returned to a bookstore to get my money back.
1,Simply sucks,"It tell you how the millonares live, but it keeps repeting itself. if you wanna know something new please don't get thisEND"
5,Lessons to be learned...,This book opened my eyes. It with other books that I have read on financial matters has helped me to realize that the wealthy are not necessarily those driving the expensive cars and living in the expensive houses. My wife and I can enjoy our humble home and enjoy know that we are financially more secure than 90% of American households.This book help to give perspective on wealth and what it means to be wealthy and live a rich life.
3,"Sure they're happy, but is their waitress?","I liked this book very much, but much less so the people it depicts. The authors say the millionaires describe themselves as happy, but to me they just come off as selfish cheapskates who make their wealth by taking rank advantage of others. I would suggest that the authors, in their follow up work, study the correlation between millionaire auctioneers and other self employed types and exactly how much income tax they pay. What isn't said is that much of their wealth comes from unreported cash income. Also it would be revelatory if the authors described wealth and religion, rather than the more politically correct ""ancestry."" But if you're willing to pay the high price of paying underprice, you too can become one of the boors this book so aptly describes."
4,Great data-driven information on the American wealthy,"This book is one of the most highly read and rated personal finance books and aptly so. The data-driven research reveals who the real millionaires in America are and its not the flashy, sports car driving individuals you might think. Its a very insightful look ino the lives, habits and finances of America's wealthy, covering a wide range of topics from purchasing watches and cars to economic outpatient care and self-employed business owners.Although the amount of data presented can become dry and redundant at times as other reviewers have stated (my main reason for 4 instead of 5 stars), the information is there for those who want to take a deeper dive into the numbers behind the summarized observations.Overall, this book presents some great personal finance lessons and is highly recommended, along with the simple lessons to be learned in ""The Richest Man in Babylon"""
5,Highly recommended reading...,"This book is a detailed study about average American millionaires, how they live their lives and how they became prodigious accumulates of wealth. The authors provide enough detailed statistical data to show that anyone can become the ""The Millionaire Next Door."" A good read for anyone with an interest in personal finance and building wealth. I also recommend the author's second book, ""The Millionaire Mind."""
2,"Sound idea, eye-opening statistics, but stupid book","I wanted to like the book, becouse I love the idea of living beyond your means and saving.And statistics are really interesting.But most of the text is just authors trashing spenders and praising supercheap millionaires. They don't question their black-and-white judgement. They don't ask: 'Isn't this person too maniacal about saving more and more and living like a bum?' They don't think, that the same behavior can be reasonable or unreasonable in different context. They criticize people, who make a lot of money, have large savings, but not as large as they ""should"". Almost nothing is said about different goals of different people and different ways to these goals. Authors seem to think that saving 20-40% of your income (no matter, large or small) is an end of itself.I recommend Gene Simmons' ""Sex Money Kiss"" instead of this book. Simmons makes a much more reasonable and persuasive case for being frugal."
2,Not bad,Interesting points but they are repeated at nauseum. This book could have easily been less than 100 pages.
5,Excellent book that you should own!,I fully recommend this book. I was first introduced to Dr. Stanleys work about 10 years ago as I built my own pratice of being a CPA to millionaires. I can attest that his research and his conclusions on the wealthy are highly accurate.Stanley does a great job of laying out statistical infortmation on American millionaires in easy to follow language. The book flows well through its first three quarters but ends a bit abruptly. Nevertheless it is required reading for anyone who wants to understand or join the wealthy.One of the most interesting aspects of Stanleys book is the clarity he provides in illustrating that the reality of how most millionaires live is nowhere near as exotic as most non-millionaires presume. This is great book that belongs in your library!
3,So you want to be a millionaire,"Not as entertaining as the TV show and sometimes outright boring...I'll summarize the book in a few words....The typical millionaire looks like and dresses like the average person, drives an older car, lives in a nondescript neighborhood, acts and lives like everyone else BUT SAVES LIKE HECK. [does not have a BMW, Gucci, or Rolex...has a Chevy, rack clothes and a Timex!!!]"
3,Great info hidden inbetween some DRY text,"Tons of great info in this book, but they need someone like the Freakonomics guys or Malcolm Gladwell to make it a little more appealing to the mass market. I know they sold millions of this title, but I wonder how many people actually made it all the way through?Here's what I learned:1. Standard of living/spending does not equal wealth2. Those who look like they're millionaires usually are not3. Don't give cash to your kids to support a lifestyle they cannot support on their own4. Buy used cars!5. Live below your meansAll great tips. All things I hope to put into practice. But I had to wade through many dry-as-a-Thanksgiving-turkey chapters and charts that to me weren't where the real meat (no pun intended!) was. All the same, a worthwhile book."
2,All arguments pro and con are valid,"All arguments both pro and con are valid. Yes this book does tell you about the lifestyles of those they studied. Yes, it is also presented in a statistical format (the authors are statisticians, not writers). Most of the millionaires interviewed had incomes around $100,000 per year. What I think the public wanted was a step by step book on how to get there earning $30,000 per year or less, like everyone else does. This book does not do it, all it does is give boring stats. To the authors, if you'd like to write a real hot selling book, then study the lifestyles of common people who got rich on a modest income, then have someone else write it for you."
3,Promotes living with little and dying with a lot,"This book is interesting in that it points out that most truly weathy people are those that saved their money. But to what purpose? They seem to promote saving money only to give it to follow on generations. What a waste of life! The best example of this was one millionaire they talked to who said that he wanted his children to ""have a better life."" Presumably they will if they do with his money what he did not do: spend it."
4,I'm in the Money!!!!,"A must read for anyone who wants ""Real"" wealth. My life has changed somewhat dramatically after following some of the common sense advise. I went from -0- net worth to well on my way in just 6 months. Gave up the $1500 a month in car payments and started living the book. I now know that I will be retired by age 50. This is not a Magical book....Just some very good common sense ideas and facts. Read it ....live it!"
2,Interesting thesis - boring delivery,"A good thesis which is well proven, unfortunatly the subject matter would be better represented in an paper than an entire book. The key points are made early on and then proved, and proved and proved. The the consequences are examined, and examined, and examined. Worth Skipping, or reading the book jacket."
3,Statistic galore to send a simplistic message.,"I enjoyed the book on the whole, but I found myself racing to the end so I could ""finish it."" The book does offer ways in which to live below your means and I agree with other reviewers in their skepticism of 'not spending a penny.""Wealth can be defined in many ways and the goal of being a millionaire for most is: I want millions and I want to live like I have millions.Reading this book changed my view--having a million dollars is no longer my goal--saving and investing what I can, while leading a happy life is much more important than saving or spending all of it.One last point for parents who are passing along money to their children--read the second half of the book. Your children will reflect your values as they pertain to money--be careful what messages you send them with your gifts."
3,"Instructive Thesis, but Highly Repetitive","This book deserves a place on everyone's personal finance bookshelf collection, because it shows us that fiscal responsibility is what underlies the wealth of many. It also shows that if we emulate their ways, that we too can build our own fortune. However, this book could have demonstrated these important points with examples with much more brevity. After the first couple of chapters, I kept saying to myself ""I read that already, tell me something new"". Still a worthwhile read."
2,Not very insightful,"This book could have been summed up in one chapter. Know what is important to you, be thrifty, and invest the difference between what you make and what you spend wisely. Too many meaningless statistics included to keep it interesting."
2,After the first chapter.....boring,"I think they took the obvious and beat it to death. Yes, I believe in saving for the rainy day, but like anything, it to can be taken to an extreme. You also have to live a little. They could have shortend the book to 2 or 3 chapters.If you have not clue about personal finance, then I might read it. Otherwise, invest in a subscription to Kiplingers or the Wall Street Journal."
2,A thin borderline...,"Many who disagrees with the issues discussed in the book complains about the extreme frugality displayed within those millionaries exemplified in the book. It is true that sound investing and saving is the key to success to become a millionaire. But many may aggre with me that what is the joy of being a millionaire if you life as a miser and doesn't spend a penny o it. As I read I somehow believed that sooner or later the authors would mention the rewards of one's frugality as they mention it. ""Save the best for last"" -- one may say, but how long should one wait, and save, to enjoy what they have accomplished with pain and sweat? It is a thin borderline, too far from it in either side is just as unhealthy as the other. Rich or poor, extremes also pays their prices."
4,It uncovers the secrets on how to be a millionaire,"Millionaire Next Door is a great book, it uncovers so many secrets on how to be a millionaire. It totally changed my perspective on how I view millionaires. Great book that will keep you reading until the next page! This book uncovers so many things, like for example, millionaires don't necessarily use extravagant credit cards, drink the best wines, wear the best clothes, or drive the best cars. Millionaires also seem to always invest any extra money, and don't necessarily show what they always have."
3,The Millionaire Next Door.,"The Millionaire Next Door is very informative on the subject of the spending habits of millionaires. The book explains the differences between the two types of millionaires, UAWs and PAWs. I do believe that I gained some understanding of what frugal and spendthrifty lifestyles are like. I don't believe the authors portrayed the average accumulators of wealth enough, and I found there to be an excessive number of statistics. The Millionaire Next Door is fairly easy to read, but is a bit tiring and repetitive."
3,Proves you can be a millionaire if you live like a pauper,"A biased book on millionaires. Points that were applicable to many people were stressed, e.g., _EVERYONE_ can be a millionaire if they saved. Not very objective. Felt like a self-help book marketed in order to sell more copies. For instance, some facts were skewed (""not a lot of millionaires buy expensive cars"" exclaims the auther, however, if ~30% of millions own 40K+ cars, I would consider that a fair amount).Religion maybe the panacea for the masses, this book wants to be the panacea for the masses' fiancial problems. For a different perspective on millionaires, read ""Rich dad poor dad.""Which book is right? I don't know, but if millionaires live like middle-income people, I'd rather be just middle-income :-)"
3,God save me from statistics.,"Stats are great but the inferences weren't that leading. I guess I expected more ""how to"" instead of ""how come""."
4,Great read! I didn't wanna put the book down!,"This was an excellent book. Although I would say that it depends if you buy into their definition of wealth. Most of North america defines wealth in dollars vs. this book defines it as NET WORTH and provides an equation as to how much net worth you should have based on your age and how much you make.I found that many of the points the author makes was true and it a provides an alternative outlook to wealth, contrary to what the media portrays.Some things that I disliked about the book is that it primarily deals with people who are in the middle income or higher bracket. It does not deal with lower income folks who would probably benefit more from advice.It also does not deal with the wealth distribution of all of north america. it primarily deals with caucasions. I did not see any ethnic minorities listed.Other than those picky details, the book was quite well written. I liked that the results were based on tests results and not just mumbo jumbo."
5,Eye-opener,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It felt like I was behind the scenes of a very well kept secret - who the ""real"" millionaires are. The tables in the book help visualize the facts, and the personal letter excerpts give insight into the mentality of others about finances. The well researched facts definitely cleared up the false image of the ""American millionaire"" I had painted in my head. Now I will definitely exercise budgeting and set aside 15% of my paycheck for personal spending. The how-to techniques in this book have motivated me to take control of my finances. It has layed the foundation for smart thinking and exposed the discipline required in moderate spending."
3,The millionaire net door,my husband loves it! lots of facts about millionaires and how they live and spend their $
5,Great Read - explains the wealthy,"I finished this book in 1 month (I'm super slow reader). Overall, it explains the value of saving, frugality, and so on. This is quite interesting since you are not taxed on the money you keep, only the money you make.This book focuses on Average Joe American who saved up to $1 -$5 million on a single income. Usually of Self-employed or entrepreneur. This is not a get rich quick, this is Statistical information on how regular millionaires think and live daily."
4,Great,I really enjoyed this book. It was slow in a few spots or me but something i'm glad that i read through.
2,The Old Boring Man Next Door,The lives chronicled in this book are pretty sad. Especially the guy and his fiance who pride themselves on never going out. Get a lifeThe book has some interesting ideas. But it never covers the concept of compounding. Compounding over time has enormous impacts on our personal balance sheetsYou need to take away from this book that there are sacrifices you need to make to become financially independent. Just don't go too far
4,Frugailty,"The book emphasizes FRUGALITY. To live a better tomorrow, you must live a worse-off today. This is ultimately living below your means, and live below your means for a long period of time and eventually you will be living large."
3,Interesting but....,Lots of repetative information in this one. Interesting information but a bit of a drag to read as the same information isre-presented in different ways over and over again.
4,"Reader from Reston, VA","A good read with sound advice that not everybody wants to hear. I find the reviews fascinating. So many 1-stars from people I can only assume are looking for an easy way to make a lot so they can spend a lot - I can see why they hated it. The authors aren't telling us we can't live a little. Just that pursuing every toy in the Sharper Image catalog will prevent most people from achieving financial security. The book DOES go over and over the main points - but I didn't find it boring, and I guess some folks still didn't get it."
5,Fascinating read!,"Absolutely love this book! If you want to know the truth of how people become wealthy, read this book. I thought it was from hitting the lottery, becoming a doctor or attorney, etc. This book illustrates empirically that plumbers, car salesman, and even you and me can become wealthy over time if you follow the lead of the ""typical millionaire"". This is NOT a 'what-to-invest-in' book. This merely illustrates in great detail how people became wealthy and, more importantly, how they STAYED wealthy."
3,How to get rich?,1. Describe your method.2. Illustrate it with examples.3. Suggest that everybody can realize your method.4. Sell your method. (to be best-seller)This was already seen.Why not:1. Fix your targets.2. Avoid spending your time and power for other things.3. Be consequent.4. Take pleasure in the results.Have a nive day.PS: carpe diem
4,It Makes $ents!!!,Answers most of the questions one would everhave about the wealthy. Useful information forthose working toward similar financial goals
3,You never know who lives next to you,This book has taught me so much about millionaires and their lifestyles. I always thought they were the ones living in large homes and driving the expensive cars but I was wrong. Most are self-made millionaires and are very intelligent. They are frugal and know how to invest and use their money. It's also not impossible to become one. You'd just have to be willing to work hard and learn to plan and build wealth.
4,Great book that sheds some light on reality,"While this book confirmed what I already believed to be true about people's spending habits. The authors made this book a fun read, especially for those who fit into the PAW category! I like their approach to research and think their results intuitively make sense. I recommend this book, especially to those who spend a lot of money keeping up with the Jones'!"
5,Great Book - Common Cents,"This was a great book to read. Although full of some statistics, it helped me to explain to my wife what we need to do to retire in style."
4,THE BEST INSIGHT INTO WHY THE WEALTHY ARE WEATHLY.,"This is clearly one of the best sources of information on why the wealthy have what they have. We don't need to make a huge annual income (although it doesn't hurt) to accumulate wealth. BE FRUGAL. Shop smart, buy smart, save and get good counsel from those who are already wealthy. Don't ""keep up the Joneses,"" be frugal and blow their doors off. You too can become a millionaire. Don't just read this book, read it more than once and DO WHAT IT SAYS."
3,Interesting but redundant,"Interesting approach to achieving wealth, but seems to have an underlying implication of greed. Implications that those who do not gain wealth donate to charity (i.e. their community) did not need to be included.The concepts on investing, purchasing, not spending lavishly to show status at the expense of wealth accumulation, gifts to children, etc., should be learned by every parent and child."
4,Destroys the myths about the rich,"If you want a book to tell you your spending habits are justifiable, this book is not for you. If you are willing to learn what habits helped make wealthy people wealthy, read on. There is a difference between high income, and wealth. The wealthy are such because they save, spend wisely, and don't care about highly-visible consumptive lifestyles. The millionaires discussed would never make it on ""Lifestyles"" of the you-know-who. It wouldn't serve their interests. After reading this book, I question if anyone on ""Lifestyles"" really is wealthy. This book is more about attitude, than investing. If you're young, read the book. If you're older, it's too late to make it. Good charts and statistics back up all analysis."
5,EASY TO READ,"This is a great book that I was advised to read by Dave Ramsey, a financial guru. It's very easy to read and understand. It gives you a whole new way to view the way you spend and save your money. Very good read."
1,Not for minorities or women and/or unmarried,"This book outright lists the ""productive"" ethnic groups in America, all of which are European only (i.e., Russia, Scotland, etc). It also lists millionaires as fitting a certain profile, such as being of European heritage, married with a stay-at-home wife. After reading these pages, I couldn't continue.I returned the book and got a refund because it offended me. I'm an unmarried female whose ancestors are not from Europe. It had no practical or useful advice that could apply to a broad audience.The authors need a crash course in diversity. Millionaires span all backgrounds. If you don't believe me, just ask Oprah (who's a billionaire)!"
4,Eye-Opening,"Very much an eye-opening experience of a read. The authors have really told a story about true wealth in America. It made me take a good, hard look at what I have accomplished and re-evaluate my future efforts. What's truly amazing is how the American middle-class is running themselves ragged trying to succeed, but only spinning in circles due to our materialistic society. I now look at those expensive homes on the golf course and wonder how many of those people really have financial freedom. I also wonder how many people have bought this book thinking it was a blueprint for how to make $1mm and then were surprised to find this book teach them a much more valuable lesson in life.I would reccommend this to anyone wanting more out of their life."
5,Great book not only about money but the way we think,"This book was very informative on the way many of the wealthy people in this nation act and think. If people would put these principles into practice the financial mess we are in right now would go away. Live within your means and invest wisely are the two continuos thems in throughout this book. It goes into some detail about things most of us would never think about, such as: how much to spend on shoes, how much to spend on a house (well most think of this), how much to spend on a suit, etc... These policies can help correct what is wrong with America, blaming the rich for our financial woes. If everyone could put these principles in practice everyone could be worth more money than they are right now.That being said it is very dry and repetitious. But if you stick to it and read the whole thing all the way through once or twice and put the ideas into practice it will help you tremendously."
2,Too much and not enough,"The central theme of living below your means is repeated over and over with numerous numbers and tables. Gets on your nerve mid way through.90% of the emphasis is placed on saving, and 10% on investing. Hardly a true picture of accumulating wealth.Curiously, the statistics used to back up the theme exclude those from the ethnic groups such as the African Americans, the Hispanics, and the Asians."
4,read it at the beginning of your career!,I sure wish I would have read this book the day I started to earn a paycheck. A must read for every college graduate to prevent getting sucked into the consumer society. Give it to your kids!!
4,The statistics make the difference,"The statistical data presented in ""The Millionaire Next Door"" goes a long way to explaining how wealth in America is actually spread. Having well defined definitions of being `wealthy,' along with the examples of actual spending and lifestyle habits of people with a net worth over a million dollars brings out in perfect detail how to decipher what are the myths of being rich and what is the reality of having sufficient wealth.I do not know if the study of wealth by Dr. Stanley and Dr. Danko was originally meant to showcase different ethnic backgrounds and there attitude toward money and wealth, but I was very pleased they presented these breakdowns. I personally would have liked to see some comparison of African American millionaires and how this (my) culture ranked in this study, but I can not condemn this great book based on this issue alone."
2,give us some meat!,good premise good characters but shallow and abrupt! i read a lot and this one felt like an authors first or second attempt... disappointing
3,okay,this book was entertaining and felt it could have been a better book. i liked the premise but i found that the meat of the book was not very good. she has left her husband and he hasnt tried to get her back for over a year. i found this to be unbelievable. it was a good short read jst dont expect anything grand.
1,Didn't get very far,"The author has absolutely no concept of the military - from small unit tactics to ""big picture"" items like early warning capabilities. This made the book unreadable for me. If he had any technical advisors at all, they learned everything they knew from made for TV movies. If you aren't bothered by dozens of technical and tactical errors, and also don't mind clipped sentences, improper use of apostrophes, etc, then you might enjoy the book. I found the plot - that is, what little of it I actually managed to read - implausible. In my opinion, this book shouldn't be more than 99 cents."
1,Avoid at ALL costs,"This appears to start out as an interesting book. However, it devolves slowly but surely. Eventually the author's real purpose comes out. This is nothing but a bunch of anti-nuclear ""The World Is Doomed"" claptrap that comes out of most left wing idealists. I really thought this thing went out of style with the '60s and the ""love children."" However, it is apparent there are still ""true believers"" around. If it were possible, I would ask for my money back. I truly wish I had never bought this item.The Third World War (Future History)"
2,slow!!!!,It takes forever to get going and then is done. not worth the time Red Phoenix is a much better book on about the same topic
4,Not a shootem up,"This is not a Tom Clancy novel although it starts out like one. The story never gets to a descriptive account of a techno-battle like Clancy. Instead it focuses on the interplay of world leadersas they try to avoid world war. That is whay some see it as fast moving and some as slow moving.More than 60% of the book is the prelude to war, not the war itself. I found the story both compelling and depressing without the triumpth of the Amaerican way a la Clancy."
2,Poor Man's Tom Clancy,While the intricies of the plot were well though out the overall execution of the details and actions of the characters were completely unbelievable. Even the worst of the Clancy books are light years better than this. Readable only for those who want to explore yet another end of the world senario but completely predictable from about one third of the way through to the end.
2,Out of Touch,"After the story repeatedly referred to the Putin years as a period of Russia ignoring its own interests in worship of all things American it became pretty hard to suspend disbelief. The total absence of any consideration of the role conventional forces would play makes it worse. The entire story is written as though the U.S. is a completely inept entity that has no experience in foreign matters whatsoever and that the only weapons ever used in the future will be nuclear, and done so without restraint and at the first provocation. The story reads like it was written by someone that not only has no personal knowledge of military tactics, but also by someone with very little understanding of current global events, recent history or cultures."
2,Slow!,"The story had good potential but it was oh so slow. There were some very good action events but, they were few and far between. I read a lot of alternate and military history and I found this book to come up short."
3,Not quite as good as I would have expected it...,"SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT!!!It creates a very plausible scenario for how a global nuclear war might start, but there are several issues which kept detracting from the final product:1) The world leaders were entirely too chummy with each other. Every single one of them was on a first name basis with each other, and you would have thought they all go on family vacations in the summer.2) The President finds out about a missile launch on CNN? Really? I would have expected NORAD to have been a little more ahead of the curve than the local news anytime someone launches a missile anywhere in the world.3) The ending. I understand it was supposed to have been a ""worst-case scenario"" kind of deal, but few people like to finish reading a book with Billions of dead. Not everything can always end with the good guys winning the day, but total annihilation is not what I'm expecting when it all ends."
2,Overwrought,"The concept of the next war blowing up in South East Asia is fine, but spare us the intimate details of each character's personal life. The novel can't decide if it's a Clancy wannabe or a bodice buster. The military details are too sparse and the personal problems repetitive."
1,Want to give it ZERO,"This system does not work with 5th generation 30GB ipods either.I contacted the company about my problems (the video only showed in black and white) and was told this is ""an Apple"" issue not theirs. But NO where on the box on on this description does it say not compatible with 5th generation 30GB ipods.BEWARE!"
3,You get what you pay for- Do not buy this DVD player,"I would like to add to the review i previously wrote, about a month later we are not able to get this DVD player to work at all. We have only had it about 6 months and it is dead. DO not buy this DVD player.We got this DVD play for my daughter to use in the car. It worked fine for a week or two, but then the battery just quit, so now we have to use it plugged in or it will not turn on. Also sometimes the screen gets gray lines through it and I have to turn it off and on until they are gone. I wanted to get one with the ipod dock and this was the least pricey. Now I'm wishing we spent more and got a better one. The dvd player over all is flimsy, the picture is good When it's working."
5,Works Great!,"We bought this DVD player for a long car trip (over 1000 miles) with the hope it would distract our 2 1/2 year old. I was concerned about volume issues that I had read about in previous reviews, so we took little speakers to attach to it. It was a wonderful surprise that we didn't need the speakers at all. Even with all the car noise, which is considerable with the air conditioner and the engine noise associated with pulling a travel trailer, it was very easy to hear the videos. Our son loved watching his movies and allowed us to travel with relative quiet and to cover more miles per day.This is a great player it never skipped even on the roughest roads and was easy to use.kristi with 2 under 3 on a 1000 mile car trip."
1,Never Got It,"The item sent was not what was ordered, sent it back to later find out they were out of stock and that I would have to wait until it was returned before i could get my money back.My son didn't get what he wanted for Christmas due to this.... Sooo is there such a product, hmmmmmm .."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this book with high expectations. It is text which repeates the obvious. There is no deep thought or significant key tidbits...it is all stuff you would learn by moving once or twice. Key information like...'if you move to Germany and don't speak the language the transition may be difficult..."" Well no kidding...if I move to Athens and do not speak Greek I would expect that buying a house may be a challenge.If you have ever been in the military and been oversees you know far more than what this book has. I expected information like: Tips on staying current with your US/State taxes, how to vote, what the embassy will do for you, where to bank, how to put money into your retirement and social security...maybe even some health care/insurance tips. There was virtually none of this. Save your money there is far better information on the Web."
2,essential stuff for the biznoid or bureaucrat,"An erstwhile training manual for the move overseas with accompanying furniture tips and contacts on the ground. For me largely a useless work; for those like me approaching retirement, I would recommend lonely planet, on ground expat works and either International Living in country manuals or Live and Invest Overseas manuals, which are written for the individual who will be making decisions and choices and provide contacts, facts and recent impressions to inform their decision making."
4,Covered topics I would not have considered,Broader view about different family members and their reactions - and the steps of adjusting to life in a new country
4,A Fantastic Find,"My boyfriend and I will be leaving the country for an extended stay in Thailand. Where to begin preparing for our trip? ""The Expert Expat"" was a fantastic preparatory tool for us. We've been reading it and marking it up as we go through, highlighting things to remember for now, and things that will be useful in the future. What's really wonderful about it is how matter-of-fact it is, and how non-intimidating. I feel like the authors are just old family friends offering me (extremely practical and prudent!) advice.I highly recommend this title to anyone leaving the country!"
4,"Great Resource, fun to read...",Great Resource! This book is fun to read and very detailed. Great job!
3,"Not bad, not great","I loved the Nightwing series from the late 90's. As such, I wanted to read this with as much enthusiasm as that series.Nightwing/Huntress is ok. The characterizations are not bad. The love plot is a little rushed at times. The flow could have been better.As for artwork, I love Greg Land as an artist but this seems to not be his typical style. It looks much darker and I'm not sure I like that. It tends to look a little dirty at times but that could just be a decision based on this being a ""Bat"" book and so it might have needed a darker tone."
3,Nice but nothing too memorable,"Nightwing & Huntress has an interesting premise and a good choice of characters to bring together. Nightwing is the grown-up Robin and Huntress was originally conceived as the grown daughter of Batman and Catwoman but recast as a mafia princess who now hunts criminals and as a more extreme version of Batman. Both are surrogate children of Batman, the loyal son and the rebellious daughter.In this story a criminal is framed for murder and they must team up to clear him and find the real killer.The case itself is not too memorable, the main point is the interaction between the two characters and how their relationship develops.It's a decent enough character story but really doesn't stick with the reader."
1,AMAZON SELLS PIRATE CD!?,"This is a shame Amazon openly sells pirate CDs!There is NO LEGAL Rick Wakeman's albums issued as ""two LP on 1 CD"", and Rick told about it many times in interview.All of those ""rare imports"" are cheap pirate CDs with bad cheap inserts. And their sound quality is TERRIBLE!Do not buy them! Do not steal from Rick!"
2,The Les Mis score over again...,"The first time Schönberg used his score was in the over the top/wonderful La Revolution Francaise. He then recycled the score into the more famous Les Miserables - which I actually like.Then bad shows like Miss Saigon and Martin Guerre came along. The creative team of Schönberg and Boublil suggested by these that they are not great dramaturgists. Instead they produce oversentimental ballads for the most inane places in a plot line.In this ballet, Schönberg has got rid of the words, and it sounds like he's written a two hour instrumental version of At The End Of The Day with some intervowen new themes.I can't really decide whether this is fine or not. I like some of Schönberg's style, but it could be that he's written the same score one too many times. Yet the score he use to write, isn't an unpleasent one."
4,Who knew insects and forensics could be such fun?,"For me, this book started out a little slow, with a great deal of exposition and explanation about the geography, Rhyme's situation, etc. But once it go going, I could not put it down.It kept surprising me, which is just what books in this genre should do. The book also made the scientific information about dirt, insects and chemicals interesting, seamlessly weaving the ""educational"" material into the terrific and ultimately page-turning plot.This was the first Deaver novel I have read, and now I plan on getting them all [yes, through Amazon of course] and reading them. That is the highest compliment I can give an author."
2,A big disappointment,"While this novel is a pretty good suspense thriller, it does not live up to the previous Lincoln Rhyme stories. Outside of the core, returning characters, the depictions were weak and somewhat one dimensional. The growing attachment between Starks & Rhyme was alluded to, but not sufficiently explored. While I am glad that Lincoln is back in a feature (as opposed to being relegated to the role of secondary character as he was in The Devil's Teardrop) I hope that future books acheive the high standard set by The Bone Collector and The Coffin Dancer."
4,Big Payoff Makes It Worthwhile,""" The Empty Chair"" in it's first twenty pages gives you a scene so horrific Deaver has a hard time keeping the pace. The story begins to drag about 50 pages in as the manhunt for the insect boy gets underway. But dear reader press on because the last 150 pages are classic Deaver. He not only pulls the rug out from under you once, but four times. And just when you think everything has played out there is one more twist. While not as lean and fast paced as his previous books this is still an intelligent and satisfying thriller."
3,Too many unbelievable twists,"Not Best of Deaver , I liked his ""Garden of beasts"" much better. Craving for twists Deaver has made all characters unbelievable and at one point the Novel becomes a joke. A waste of time and money."
3,"Quite good, but not Deaver at his very best","When I read this book, I was kind of dissapointed. Sure, the plotline was well-contructed and suspenseful, and it did keep me up all night to the very last page, but for some reason it is more unpolished than his other works. There are many useless characters, comments and ideas that tend to mix the reader up. Still, it was enjoyable, but somewhat unsettling."
4,Excellent,"This was my first book by Deaver, and it will not be my last. In certain areas the book seems to drag just a little, but overall a good read with an ending that will not allow you to put the book down. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great reading but not his best work,"Deaver hooks us in again with another Lincoln Rhyme Novel and keeps us guessing all the way to the end. I particularly enjoyed the way he used the ""Insect Boy"" and his reading material to instruct us forensics as well as life.The ending seems slightly contrived and using MCS to explain some of Garret's symptoms does not work for me because MCS is a highly controversial diagnosis of a ""syndrome"" that is considered to be more psychological than physical. Toxaphene is not proven to be a human carcinogen so to blame Lucy's cancer and the cancers and illnesses of others in the community on that one chemical also seem to be stretching it. Despite these flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the latest adventures of Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs and hope that we will see more of them. I also hope that Deaver will remember to write the books for his readers--not for a potential movie audience."
3,"The Empty Emotionless Boy, I mean Chair","It's hard for me to take a book seriously when one of the main characters breaks a 16 year old out of jail purely because the jail escapee claims he is innocent, and the main character (Sachs) thinks he is telling the truth.Yes ladies and gentlemen, that is the only reason why Sachs breaks him out of jail. I found the 16 year old (and every plot point where he is involved) annoying and very hard to swallow as a legitimate character - if only because of the author's portrayal of him.With that said, the book had it's moments. I might have given it a better review had the 16 year old boy been cut out and someone else pasted in."
3,Not impressed,"I have to admit that my first contact with Jeffrey Deaver's work was the film version of his novel ""The Bone Collector."" It was not a film I was deeply impressed with, but since so many good books translate into lousy movies, when I came across ""The Empty Chair,"" I decided to give it a chance. Well . . . I wasn't that impressed with this, either. Technically, Deavers writes well, but I really didn't find myself drawn into the story or to the characters, although the plot was certainly one of the more interesting ones I've come across. I also attempted this book's predecessor, ""The Coffin Dancer,"" with much the same result. To me, Deaver brings the secondary and minor characters to life far better than he does his main characters, Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs. I may try to go back and read some of Deaver's earlier Rhyme novels and see if my opinion changes, but as of right now, I definitely would not recommend ""The Empty Chair"" to those unfamiliar with Deaver's work."
3,Not Deaver's Best,"Empty Chair was a good read, not a great read, but a good read. I've read the majority of Deaver's novels and have found several to be great reads; this one unfortunately was not the best of his work.Great concept, but the twist was a little forced and I actually didn't read the last 10 pages or so because of this.Anyway, in comparison to the market, (seems really gripping thrillers are few and far between) I'd recommend it."
3,more melodrama than intelligent thriller,"I have read the previous Rhyme novels and enjoyed them, but this one is disappointing. Deaver is too careless with science (misrepresenting what a gas chromatograph can do) and his material (in one case, either the map is wrong or his description of a river is). Furthermore, the book turns much more toward melodrama by having too many confusing twists and turns. He is so interested in such tricks that his characters behave implausibly. I half expected to find the heroine tied to the railroad tracks before it was over."
2,boneyard,"Sorry Jeffery , Hollywood and deadlines for mass producing novels have gotten to you too. This one starts with a good concept [getting Linc and Amelia out of the Apple] and even satisfies the good writing criteria , but fails miserably in its lack of Deaver's compelling villain chacterizations. The Insect Boy character had some real potential but failed miserably in the end, just as the entire novel did. This is truely one of the most unbelievable endings I've ever come across. The author would have us believe that the true villain tries to murder half the town in a tiny berg in North Carolina where almost nothing happens until Lincoln and Amelia show up. The entomology lessons were cute but if good ole Linc analyzes any more dirt like this he should wind up in the BONEYARD. Truely disappointed."
2,Tedious,"I might have been able to enjoy this book more had it not been for the glaring errors pertaining to science. I want to know what kind of GC can be set up in ten minutes and then be programmed to run dirt, of all things. Add to that a group of characters who are all just boring as hell. Not on my top ten list."
3,Jeffrey Deaver - resting on his laurels?,"""The Bone Collector"" with its wealth of detail about the history of New York, and the introduction of the complex characters of Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs held the interest and whetted the appetite for more of the same calibre. Unfortunately, ""The Empty Chair"" stretches the readers' incredulity and eventually loses their interest. The book divides into two sections, the first the search for a presumed serial killer and abductor of young women. This section is just credible but lacks the fascination of the in-depth knowledge of an area that is displayed to such effect in ""The Bone Collector"".The second half of the story has Sachs behaving in a manner that is, quite frankly, out of character and which stretches credulity to the breaking point. To my disappointment, I had lost interest before I reached the end. Not up to the standard of the other two Lincoln Rhyme books."
2,Daylight Saving Time,"I was not too impressed with this book, and part of it had to do with the timeline. Is it just me, or did it seem that there were just too many hours in the day for the characters? Let's see, they arrive in the city and meet with a surgeon, get talked into traveling to Tanners Corner to take on an investigation, requisition equipment, set up a lab, train an apprentice, interview local experts, collect and analyze evidence from town employees, Sachs goes to two different crime scenes to ""walk the grid"" and collect more evidence, evidence is analyzed, a manhunt on foot goes through miles of swamp and bush while being haltingly directed by cell phone, the target is captured, dragged back to town, interrogated, lawyers and psychologists arrive, more interrogation, another meeting with the surgeon, a jail break, another manhunt while an escape is made by boat and on foot, and it's finally starting to get dark. What's up with that?"
3,Not the best Lincoln Rhyme,Sometimes things are just a little bit too far fetched. That seems to work better in the big city than the back woods.
5,Excellent,I have read all of John Sanford/Robert Walker/Patricia Cornwell/ect. This was an excellent read - just when I though it was ending there was another twist. I love Jeffrey Deaver. Congratulations and this book - keep them coming!!
3,The Empty Story - A great disappointment,"Having read all three in the Rhyme series, I am reminded of John Gresham: first books were great, made a movie and it's all downhill from there. This Rhyme novel still has the tedious forensic details, but the plot is really lacking. It's not a page turner - I rate it a C-."
2,Running on empty,"Sorry folks, but there's less reason and too much Rhyme to Deaver's latest. The Carolina setting not only leaves Rhyme and Sachs adrift, but the author too. If Rhyme solves another mystery by analysing soil deposits, I'm going to ask for my cash back. Thin on plot throughout, it crams too much exposition into the final pages and, far from delivering a trademark Deaver double-whammy ending, it just peters out. Sorry, but it's time to put the forensic duo out to pasture for good (provided, of course, the soil will sustain them)."
3,Not very engrossing,"For some reason, as I was reading this book my mind kept wandering. I'd suddenly realize that, while I had `read' the last two pages, they hadn't really registered. I don't know if it was just that I wasn't in the mood for that particular type of book (it was for a book club, so I couldn't put off reading it), if I've OD-ed on mysteries, of it there was just something about this book that I didn't quite like. Looking at it from a purely superficial viewpoint, there was nothing really wrong with the plot, the characters, or the writing, but it just did not draw me in. I didn't feel that tug of interest. It was just... okay. Until I got to the end, which annoyed me for its happy sitcom-wrap up `good people are really all okay no harm no foul thank you very much' ending. If it's possible to be ticked off about a happy ending, for some reason this book made me just that. I can't pinpoint why I didn't like it, the attraction just wasn't there."
5,Deaver's always five stars,"It was fun to get Rhyme out of New York and -- alright I'll admit it -- maybe there are some compromises at the altar of plot twists (Deaver's speciality) but Deaver's ability to surprise and entertain, even with returning characters Rhyme and Sachs (the movie Bone Collector spoiled Sachs for me -- I always visualize Jolie) makes him solidly five stars for me. I'd read anything by Deaver just for fun (some of his earlier novels don't grab me as hard, but anything post-Bone Collector is all the way five stars for this reader). Enjoyable pace, maybe the background characters in this case were slightly ""off"" or even wooden, but you just can't argue with the pure entertainment value of Deaver and Rhyme-Sachs."
5,Deaver Never Ceases To Amaze Me,"While I must admit that the entire insect thing was not all that interesting to me, once again Jeffery Deaver has managed to create a magnificent piece of literature. Nobody spins a web of mystery quite like him and takes a reader on more of a rollercoaster ride. Just when you think you have it all figured out, something else comes out of the woodwork. There is a simple word for that: SUSPENSE, and Deaver is a master of it."
3,Read his others first,"If you haven't read Deaver's book, pick up the others first. This is OK but certainly not as good as ""The Coffin Dancer"", ""The Bone Collector"" or ""The Devil's Teardrop"""
5,A must read,Jeffery Deaver is one of my favorite authors and the Empty Chair featuring Lincoln Rhyme was an excellent book that I could not put down I cannot wait for his next Rhyme novel. Anyone looking for a great suspense book must read this it is the best.
5,Another Deaver Masterpiece!,"Another great read from Deaver. His twists and turns are second to none. And it was interesting to read about the New York detectives out of their element. Only one caution - if you haven't ""met"" Lincoln Rhyme and company before, read The Bone Collector or The Coffin Dancer first. This book is best if you already know the background on the main characters!"
3,It's all about the money.......,"First thing I want to say is, that The Coffin Dancer and The Bone Collector are better books from Deaver. The idea is set up pretty good. Two girls are missing and kidnapped by The Insect boy. If you've read the first two books of the series, you know, those took place in New York. This book has a total different setting. A small southern community called Panaquenoke.There are a lot of twists, to my opinion to many. And the end is pretty weak. I hope The Stone Monkey is better, I will keep reading the Licoln Rhyme series. 3 stars."
3,"This is no ""Speaking in Tongues"" or ""Bone Collector""","This book (I had the audio book so it was probably abridged) was very interesting until the last 20%. Then he takes us places which are so far from where we have been led that I ejected the tape and ended it right there. It was pathetic and reminded me of the last few Grisham books. He was selling a great product and I was in a buying mood. He just couldn't close the sale. He kept talking and talking and eventually things were so convoluted, I lost interest."
3,Good read!,"I read The Bone Collector and didn't put two and two together when the film came out. Obviously the book was far better than the film.However, Deaver writes a really good book. I love being taken away and introduced to an environment with which I am not familiar and yet feel like I know it. That is the case with The Empty Chair. The characters are real and vivid. The story is good, but not great and the outcome is satisfying if a bit too formulatic.I'd recommned this book and I'll read others of Deaver's books."
4,guess and check.,"If I were to summmon one person that I could place in the empty chair and I was to say one thing to that person it would take but a few simple words, ""thank you Mr. Deaver"". Deaver captured my emotions and altered them as only a true master of manipulation could. I give this one 4 out of 5."
2,PERHAPS DEAVER'S WORST BOOK?,"Is this Deaver's worst book? I honestly don't know because I haven't read everything he's written. However, I can emphatically say this is the worst of his books I have read -- and I have read most.(...)"
1,BORING READING,"Tbis book had to be the most boring I have read in a long time The plot is not even believable, the dialogue chapter after chapter was a drag to even read. I stop after about the 6th Chapter. I can only think that Deaver must be under contract to produce so many books a year and this one is what I call a ""pipeline product"" I am so sorry that I purchased it. If this is the best Deaver can do I suggest he gives up writing. A perfect book for anyone with insomnia."
1,Smell Terrible!,Bought these pillows and they smell like tar. Yep that stuff they spread on roofs. Had to throw them out because they smelled so bad.
3,Small and Stiff,"These pillows are a little on the small side. Not the most comfortable for laying on, they are a little stiff. But they look nice on our leather couch and easily wipe clean."
2,A little too fictional to believe.,"While an okay story, do not read this book if your researching the Orphan Trains. Too many events make Emma, the main character, seem a saint to the children. The awesome occurance of events gives the story a over-powering fictional side. And the sub-romantic plot wasn't needed in the least. All in all, read this book if your in the mood for a story set around the Orphan Trains, not for one ABOUT them."
5,Absolutely Scrumsculescent,"Magic in the Mirror is a story about love, war, and unbridled enthusiasm. The young boy, Rudy, is a curiously intelligent character, yet has a childish naiveté that leads Rudy into trouble.The title of the movie, wildly suggestive, yet under complete control of the flawless director, only gives a hint of the magical journey the audience will experience throughout the film.I cannot stress the dire importance of seeing this masterpiece. In fact, you shouldn't even be reading my review, because your family should be running to the nearest movie store to get this movie for your viewing pleasure."
3,Commedia dell'arte - webbed Carroll redeux,"Happenstance brought me to this film, drawn like a moth to flame by the menacing VHS box-art visage - the tableau a delightful blend of decadent autocracy and paralyzing futurism. The first viewing elicited memories of the Noh tradition, strong, immutable masculine characters cavorting about, shaking the shackles of special effects limitations to pantomime a fundamental conundrum ""What if malevolent ducks exist in another dimension?"" Further screenings, however, revealed a much more robust story, oozing with crisis and context that would draw praise from the most jaded of viewers. This film shatters the proscenium, mandating that YOU the viewer participate in this most wonderful of farces. Undulating between sensations of grief and victory, pugnacious jingoism and Elizabethan turgidity, this film scape is one to behold and be beholden to."
5,Possibly his best yet.,"Once again Burke balances a huge, twisted set of character against a complicated backdrop and juggles it all into place by the end. I love the sense of place and character he gives to New Orleans and his players and love to read his prose. Unlike most others in his genre (Ian Rankin being another exception) I am lapping up each sentence, not in a hurry to the stories conclusion.A head and a half above all others."
4,Robuster,"Streak gets to confront one of his pressing demons in this continuing saga.Published over ten years ago it is still a good read.A must if you enjoy this line of Burkes.For me, one of his better efforts."
5,Robicheaux is back and better than ever.,"Is there another writer whose word pictures are more picturesque than those of James Lee Burke?The Robicheaux series keeps improving. This one fills in the back story on the detective's mother's death (murder).Her death intersects with current crimes and leads Robicheaux down a twisting path filled with wonderfully colorful chaacters (both good and bad.)Much is not as it first appears. The fine line between hero and villain is often murky as some of the rogues seem to possess some redeeming qualities. Naturally each of the ""white hats"" is flawed, having their own demons to overcome. It's a magnificent cross section of humanity and great slice of life.The various subplots dovetail nicely into a roaring finale. The story proceeds at an excellent even pace, never forced.""Purple Cane Road"" is a well told tale that keeps you turning pages and guessing up to the final page."
3,Solid Burke Work,"In spite of his inability to keep his left leaning politics out of his work, Mr Burke is a master at painting verbal images. I often have to put the book down in order enjoy a good laugh. Being a semi-super commuter and an avid fan of reader Will Patton, I find my drive less stressful when I share the commute with this gifted pair on audio."
3,"Good, but not the best","I have read all of James Lee Burke's work at least twice. While this one is good, the plot is a little weak and falls into a common theme. The end has a neat twist, but you see it long before the end. Dave Robichoux has lost some of the edge and demons that plauged him in earlier books. If you are just begining to read James Lee Burke, read the collection of short stories in ""The Convict"". Then read ""Heaven's Prisoner's"". You'll enjoy those much more."
4,Back Again,"This is the strongest entry in the Robicheaux series in some time. Too often, Burke's plots disappear into a mess of tangled events that happened to Dave years ago. In PURPLE CANE ROAD, Dave and Clete do some actual police work! Burke's great theme is how the past is never through with us, and he explores it movingly here. I also enjoyed Clete, Bootsie, and the always-unnamed New Iberia sheriff, who seemed much more 3d this go-round. I highly recommend this to all fans of good American detective fiction."
3,James Lee Burke. Purple Cane Road,"After reading half a dozen or more JLB you wear out a bit on the rain and the descriptions every dozen pages or so. It is like filler for the story. I will continue to ""endure"" the rain and smells of fish in the bayou but it does wear thin formevery novel with the same predictable weather."
4,I enjoyed this book.,"Sometimes successful characters go on far too long to be believable. Dave Robcheaux is starting to become this character. He is getting to be an old man. As his age he is far to good in fistfights and in the bedroom to be believable. However, this does not mean that James Lee Burke is not still spinning a pretty darn good story."
4,I have a Clete Purcell hat.,Does that tell you something? I'm am an avid fan of Mr. Burke's and can't wait to visit New Iberia. The author writes with a ''Man's Man'' attitude and the dialouge between characters is accurate and realistic. The imagery and obvious adoration for southern Lousiana is virtual in description and makes me homesick on a regular basis. Keep em' coming Mr. Burke!
2,Violence Murders Itself,"A good start, good atmosphere and pace, but the novel suffers from a surfeit of violence, the interest slows. Nothing subtle here. Like Elmore Leonard, but Elmore has more humor."
5,Love James Lee Burke,"I LOVE James Lee Burke, especially the Thorn series, being from Key West...His descriptions of settings are amazing and accurate.I also LOVE all of his other writing, and recommend him to everyone I know who is into other authors of his style or locations...Further, I would like to recommend Alifair Burke to anyone who is a fan of James Lee Burke or his style."
2,2 excellent tracks forget the rest,"another night and runaway were two of the freshest dance floor fillers for rainbow coloured nellys in europe in the 1990's but that's it.you have toa dmire the nerve of some record companies marketing departments ""platinum and gold collection"" ? !! 2 decent tracks do not make a collection and the rest are boring album fillers."
3,Good but . . .,"It was a good book, the plot was great. But once again, it was Kara centered. That's one of the most dissapointing things about all of the books. It's always Kara or Adriane. Emily hardly ever gets an important or major roll, even in the book she supposedly was the main character in.Like I said, the book was great. But we really need to see more of one of the other characters be main."
2,Lesson Learned,"Although the item I recieved was nice it wasn't what I was expecting. I thought I was receiving a full size angel not a four inch one. The description wasn't very clear, and I guess it was my fault for purchasing something that did not have a clear description. However I had orginally planned to give this to my mother-in-law as a Christmas present but now I guess it will just be a stocking stuffer or just a little thinking of you gift due to the small size. Oh well I have definitely learned a good lesson about a deal that is too good to be true, and description that aren't clear enough."
1,Winter Angel,I received the wrong angel. I received an autumn ornament angel and am to buzy to hassel to return it for correct angel.
3,FERTILE IS FAR-FETCHED,"This ""doomsday virus"" novel by Charles Wilson starts out very well, establishing a creepy what if scenario with an incredibly dangerous virus. The virus is transmitted by bodily fluids, and makes its victim virtually go insane and on a murderous rampage. We have the typical husband/wife team of scientists who work feverishly to establish just what the virus is and how it came about. There are also a few subplots showing how the virus is spreading. Unfortunately halfway through, the novel turns into an incredulous chase scenario with our heroes doing pretty incredibly stupid things. The book also has an ending that seems like Wilson wrote because he had to come up with a happy ending; it's not convincing at all. Too bad, it could have been better."
5,One of the best,"Pockets and room, what more can you want. One of the best bags I have owned. On of my zippers has got a bit funny over the last year but it is very minor."
4,Great Bag with 1 exception!,"Taken it to the range 8 types and love it. Plenty of room for everything. The only thing I didn't like about it was the zippered space for a gun incorporated into the bag. The other bags I looked at in this price range had removable, padded and zippered gun storage with the bag."
5,The elderly lady for whom I purchased this CD is overjoyed!!!,"I personally am not a fan of this type of music, but the elderly lady I purchased it for, called me and allowed me to listen to it over the phone. She even sang a couple of songs herself!!!!"
3,"grear picking, but","this is a great assembly of pickers. the talent is second to none. the music should have been listed under gospel, or religious. for the most part, that what your going to listen to."
2,Big disappointment,"I've been a fan of all 3 of these guys for over 30 years but this CD was a real letdown. The choice of material, the quality of the arrangments and the recording quality were all disappointing. Maybe the DVD might be more interesting, but skip this CD. I'll be selling mine on Amazon right away!"
5,Three's Company: Season Seven,"The item was as advertised and arrived on time and in very good shape. I had no contact with the merchant, but from what I experienced, I would recommend this vendor with hesitation.Three's Company: Season Seven"
2,just ok,the show lost it's zip by season 7. the chemistry wasn't the same. the scripts had gotten watered down&you could sense a show just going through the motions on quite a few of these episodes.the show had it's last real peak during Season 4.i still enjoy watching the show though.
3,The title is a great exaggeration,"The book will teach you clinically proven methods to INFLUENCE people, but never to control other people's beavavior. There is a great distinction between the two. This is one of the better books on practical psychology because it is based on solid research on Psychology. Plus, the author is a Psychology PhD and not some crackpot who thinks he\she understands the human mind and behavior without ever taking a course on Psychology. This gives the book a great deal of credibility."
2,"Been there, done that","This is another one of those books that promises the world, and leaves you quite disappointed. How many of us have felt like this when purchasing a self-help book... very excited at first, a little less excited after the first couple of chapters, and then, finally, totally burned. It was really nothing new, and some of the approaches border on the ridiculous."
3,mis-leading title,"I seen this book laying around my mothers house for years, then I picked it up and read some of it. While it dose have some interesting tips in it, However you can't get anyone to do anything. I actually get more out of books likeQuotes: from the Cunning and the Powerfulfor tips on how to more people in certain directions. But if any book could truly make people do what you wanted them to do it wouldn't be a book it would be magic."
1,Kindle version very disappointing,"The Kindle version of this book is very disappointing. It is full of typos and was not apparently proof-read or even spell-checked. I'm looking at a chapter called ""TARE CONTRRL OF ANY SITUATION"" (sic). Very disappointing."
2,The Title helped it sell,The book was boring to read. The examples were weak. The title was the best thing.
4,Can be helpful to some people.,"This book of psychological secrets that explain how to read people, avoid being manipulated and get the upper hand in any situation, could be helpful for some people to read."
2,total bs,"This book is a waste of money and the time it takes to read it! It is all BS. Basically, the material presented is the same that has been around forever. It all sounds like something one would have studied in an intro psychology class in the 1960's-and it has since been proven untrue! The time I wasted on this is time I will never get back. Don't make the same mistake I did. Save your time and money."
4,Content and useable information,This book is filled with common sense advice and tactics you can put into action immedately - and they WORK!
3,Primitive,"This is very primitive guide. Most of it is common sense. Reading this book it smelled like, Dale Carnegie ""How to make friends and influence people"""
3,Manipulation 101,"Yes this is basic manipulation 101.The best thing about this book is that it gives you basic psychological information. So much so that it seems like a watered down crash course in the subject area.But who am I to say anything about psychological manipulation?I gave it three stars. It does contain some surface information. If you want to properly utilize it's methods you will need alot more literature, training, etc.But please, learn to control yourself before you control others!"
5,Powerfull,"David J. Lieberman has written one great book. After reading this book I look at the world entirely different. Almost every time I see a commercial I spot a technique used in this book. One of the things I like best about it is how it is set up. If you want to get someone to do something for you, you just flip to the appropriate chapter and you're set! In fact, I used one of the techniques on my mom to get her to buy me another one of his books!"
2,"A great title, but much too weak to accomplish it!","Expected much more because of the title. Most of the points that were made used the phrases, ""Studies show,"" or ""Research shows,"" etc., and were very unconvincing. They appeared to be just the authors opinion! Quality seemed to be about at a high school level. Some of the ideas had good value, but too many were very poor."
5,Highly Recommended,"I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for powerful, concise tips on dealing with other people, and just life in general. I think you will want to refer to the advise offered often."
2,How to nag until you get your way,"A guide for the selfish baby that always wants their way. One of the sections was on how to get your friends to do what you want to do even if they are all against you. When I read through each of the chapters the phrase ""always get your way when..."" comes up too frequently."
2,Not very useful,"Compared to 48 Laws of Power and 33 Strategies of War by Robert Greene, this book is worthless. It barely skims the surface of the psychology of influencing people, with little tricks that might be useful sometimes. Robert greene's books improved my entire life. This book is just a novelty."
4,CONCISE AND CLEAR,"I found this to be a very practical book for learning how to approach a variety of situations. I have used some of the techniques and they are very effective. Don't be misled, this is not a book that will teach you how to bilk folks out of money, get you laid by Pam Anderson, or start your own cult. It will however assist you in a variety of social transactions.Very well done."
4,"Easy to read, exhaustive and brief","The thing that I most appreciate of this book is how full of contents it is, despite of its length. It touches almost all of the important points about persuasion, and it shows them in a very practical way, without forgetting to mention some interesting researches here and there. it's very synthetic, divided in short chapters with abstracts at the end of each, and this makes it very easy when you want to look up for something later on. The first chapters are more interesting, while the second part of the book can be sometimes piddling, but it is still worth your money."
5,This stuff WORKS!!!!,"I have been using the techniques in this book at work with my employees and clients and I am finding everyone so much easier to deal with. It has made me a better person, friend, and boss since now I understand how others think and feel. Letting others know you respect and appreciate them is like magic and they really will do whatever you want to maintain that relationship you have with them. RESPECT!"
5,Excellent,This book is excellent and teaches various psychological methods to influence people. It makes a lot of references to NLP and cognitive psychology. Very helpful in the real world. Well written by a knowledgeable professional.
1,Self defeating!,"In Chapter 7, ""The Six-Star Test to See if Someone is a True Friend,"" David Lieberman says about Loyalty: ""Tell a secret about a mutual friend and see if it gets back to him or her. True friends know the value of trust in a relationship. Just make sure that you get the permission of your friend to tell her secret ot this other person.""For someone who is trying to establish trust, doing such a manipulative, underhanded thing is hardly trustworthy behavior that will enable one to build a sound and lasting friendship - permission or not. Being a true friend is about giving, not about testing and conspiring. Being vulnerable to someone is one of the risks of establishing a friendship - I'd rather find out the hard way that I misjudged someone than sink to the sneaky and contemptible nadir that Lieberman suggests.Incidentally, my teenaged children were equally horrified by Lieberman's ""techniques."""
4,A new mindset...,"Lieberman's book, which I listened to on CD, gathers psychological secrets to help control and influence different situations. I found most of his tips and secrets to be common sense, yet when I look back in time and remember different situations, it would have been handy to have been able to recognize what exactly is going on. I recommend this book to perhaps reinforce what you already may know. Particulary interesting was toward the end of the book where Lieberman went into handling physical and sexual assaults. Not only was the information extremely useful, but would probably be practical."
3,Good Read but Simplistic,"This book is generally a good read, with some practical tips. My only critcism is the book is too simplistic. Human behaviour is very complex and in a vacuum yes many of this strategies would be useful. But in real life they may not work. There a lot factors such as culture, personal beliefs, values that effect human behaviour and to generalize to a set single theories to solve life's problem is a bit ridiculous. The book's language is a little manipulative with words like Never, any Situation, Really, Ever. I would recommend this book as a good guide on human behaviour and use it as reference not as absolute truth."
2,I felt like I was reading an outline,He never went into great detail on anything. The chapters were more like long paragraphs. It would have been a great and effective book if any of the ideas had been expanded upon.
2,Same old Same old,"My feeling towards this book is that it reuses all ideas that has already presented in other self help books and just bundle it together with a new cover. Yes, the ideas within can be useful but i did not gain any new knowledge from reading this book. However, there are some good ideas within and still worth a read if you would like to know more about reading body languages and improving your communication through better choice of word selection."
5,Pop Psychology At Its Best,"I loved this book. Even if you're not looking for psychological tactics to use, this book is a fun read. I'm not sure how scientific it all is, although the book does refer to many studies, but the techniques ACTUALLY work!Get it if you need some ideas on how to get your boss, wife, etc. to see things your way_ _ _"
3,Not that great....,"This book is just methods to try to manipulate people. Not terribly helpful. I'd recommendWinning Without Intimidation : How to Master the Art of Positive Persuasion in Today's Real World in Order to Get What You Want, When You Want Itinstead."
5,Useful book,"I got the audio version and have listened to it several times to incorporate the author's thinking into my thinking patterns. The audio version releived me from reading the book several times. Many people would benefit from the information, although the title might be somewhat optimistic."
2,Basic common sense,I purchased this book hoping to be enlightened on some major secrets on how to have the upper hand in any social situation. It proved to be no more than basic common sense. Any [person] will tell you that smiling at people softens their opinion toward you. You won't get any more information from this book than you would by simply living.
1,Cheap Words,"This book is not worth the money, seriously. It is based on over-generalized common sense which the author refers to as scientific research. The solutions it offers too simplified. How can it be a bestseller??? If you are thinking of buying this book because of its outrageous title, think again, don't fall for that trap."
2,Not worth it...,"This is a book where the author gives secrets on how to control common situations: "" get anyone to like you, how to make a fantastic first impression, get anyone to understand anything, secrets to winning every situation...""The only problem is that half of the tips are useless..."
1,I can't believe I bought this,"The title is a lie. There are several techniques that they claim will work ""anywhere"" and ""anytime"" and they wont.One of the ""techniques"" that you are supposed to use is that if your looking for a mate have an attractive person of the opposite sex with you when you want to attract a person your choosing. Why, might I ask, would you not just date the person that is more attractive than you if you thought they were so attractive?And how am I supposed to use that ""technique"" during an email, letter or a phone call?There are a few ""techniques"" in the book I found ""kinda"" useful, but they will certainly not work ""anywhere"" or ""anytime"". And a lot of the techniques are VERY case specific.I will gladly pay ANYBODY 50 bucks if they can show me a technique that works that works anywhere and anytime that doesn't involve putting a gun to someone's head.Like I said, there are a few useful techniques but the book does not live up to its title. That's why I'm giving it one star."
3,Anything?,"Now, don't get me wrong - Dr. Lieberman makes some good points. But calling them secrets? Many of these are common sense. I read this book hoping for help in the dating/seduction game. And I've gotta say, it's not nearly as good as How to Succeed with Women, or How to Have Sex with Hot Girls without even dating them."
3,Not what I expected,"Some good tips, however definitly does not provide any real solid knowledge...basically full of common sense. Worth reading only if suck in air port other than that do not expect much to gain."
4,Overhyped but still very useful tactics,"I was excited before reading this book given the hype of its title and cover but having read several similar books I was realistic with my expectations.There is no simple technique to allow you to outsmart or out-manoeuvre anyone, it simply does not exist, so this book does not deliver it as stated. It does however give you a framework to understand when you are being manipulated and tactics that can be effective in some situations in order to get what you want.Because the tactics can be effective in some social and business interactions I decided not to be too critical of the marketing hype. If you are about to buy it, expect some very sound tactics and advise, all based on established psychological principle, but don't expect to be able to control every human interaction you will have."
5,FANTASTIC,"This book is great because it's completely practical. There's no junk or filler. Even more the techniques work amazingly well.The book is well researched and very useful in business as well as in personl situations.I picked it up after seeing it on the NYT Business Bestseller list. Provacative title indeed. But it does deliver. Trust me, it's good stuff.I read all of these kind of books and this is a cut above the rest. It also non-manipulative and much more psychologically-based. But very easy to follow and do."
2,Looks like the auther's tactics Worked on us - the buyers!,"The predatory nature of this attemp at pop-psych should be a giveaway that these ""tactics"" would only work on a ""target person"" with an extremely low IQ... but you only know that AFTER you buy the book. Lines like ""... become the perfect psychological warrior!"" probably made every used-car sales manager go right out and buy a copy... they would have been better off buying works of several other authors sold here, like Stephen Covey, or Joseph O'Connor. I personally (thankfully) don't know anyone stupid enough to fall for the ""techniques"" outlined in this book. I would have spent my book-money on better authors if I'd only known."
2,Mediocre,"I agree, the book has many, many good insights and most of it makes sense. You can theoretically use his techniques, but sometimes they are just unrealistic in real-life situations. Also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth, more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips. Sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited. I would not buy this again...it's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life--not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee. It seriously lacks depth but it's a decent read...but you will forget everything you read in 2 days.I'm sure there are lengthier and more in depth books that deal with the same topic which are more worth your money, time and effort."
3,Very superficial. A few good tips but shallow.,"I came across this book in my continuing research of NLP and hypnosis. Neither of which are addressed in this book. This book is a very basic and shallow guide to how to get along better with people. There is no magic here, no great revelations, just basic common sense advice on how to better interact with others.I won't say the book was bad, it wasn't. However, it is very shallow and there is nothing in here that you wouldn't already know how to do. I expected at least some detailed conversational advice and, while this book had some, it was very limited.It's a very quick read, very simple, and if you're looking for a good two day read to help you polish up your people skills for a new sales job, or a presentation, you will probably find a few helpful tips in here. If you are looking for something deeper, this isn't it."
4,Controlling the downside - Influencing Outcomes,"This is a very efficient and poignant guide for controlling and influencing the outcome in bad behavioral situations. In essence, learning self-defensive psychological persuasion tactics. I prefer Cialdini's Influence over this one, but there was a sufficient amount of additional advice that can be gleaned from this that makes it a recommended read. Well- researched speaking techniques that are very practical for creating positive outcomes, particularly from a management perspective.There's a similar book that works for behavioral control in relationships that is very useful, and funny to boot.The Professional Bachelor Dating Guide - How to Exploit Her Inner Psycho."
4,Useful but..,"The techniques are useful and scientific, but the way the author writes it some times makes it boring, but some parts are interesting anyway."
3,OK,"What can I say about this product, that hasn't been said already. It works. Does exactly what it supposed to do."
3,good basic NLP rapport building and leadershp,Nothing earth shattering nor extremely covert. Good basic knowledge for relationships and work environments. No hocus pocus. Read Black Skills for higher level menatl work.
1,Can I Persuade You Not To Read This Book?,"Poorly written, High school game plans if you ask me.Just a bunch of tricks anyone over forty already knows. Should not be titled psychological secrets.These are only secrets to the author, not ""psychological tactics governing human behavior""."
1,I wouldn't recommend it,"It has some good facts about human psychology in it but after a few chapters it just was hogwash. The title makes you want to read it, not what I expected."
2,Other people's research,"Not a bad book, but really not much more than packaging other people's research and ideas-- though the research and ideas are, in themselves, good ones. As a casual read for those unfamiliar with the study of persuasion it's okay, but much better choices would be Cialdini's ""Influence,"" and Robert Levine's ""The Power of Persuasion."""
1,better books out there,"ho hum book -- if you want the real thing --- find ""The Art of Manipulation"" by RB Sparkman circa 1976. Pricy, Amazon offrs it for 149.99. I got it on Ebay for around 25.00. I buy these kinds of books, because I am an easy mark and don't like to get taken... Once you purchase it NEVER LET IT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT! I lent mine to someone in 1988 and have been trying to replace it ever since..."
1,Not a good book.,A total waste of time. I still cannot understand why this book got such good views. Maybe it is just me. The only thing that worked is his title. It got me to buy the book.
4,Really helpful hints for interpersonal relationships,This book is lively if not too short. You are left wanting to hear more. But it gives really valuable hints for dealing with real life problems.I'd recommend it highly.
4,this guy is a good mentor,"the book is a very easy read and in no way does it show content that is unimportant or unneccessary. the parts on stopping bu_ttheads on their tracks are specially good and enjoyable. learn some stuff about psychology that is actually real and works everyday, its scary if this book were five stars. it would probably be some sort of magic."
5,Great product. Bought from Amazon Warehouse Deals,"I installed this in a 318ti and it works great. It was listed as ""used"" under the Warehouse Deals link for $95 with free shipping. It arrived and other than some extra tape on the box, it was new.Nice smooth clutch that doesn't slip and works fine."
4,Blackline masters aren't very exciting...,"...but they work just fine!This is a book of blackline masters designed for grades 4-6. There are three sections in the book: patterns, imagery and logic. Each section has three different levels of activities, ranked from one star to three star.The patterns section has design patterns, number patterns, calendar patterns, letter patterns, number chains and more. The imagery section has cube patterns, stare and compare, puzzle shapes, order by design and more. The logic section has all different kinds of logic problems using numbers, stories, attributes and more.The book is designed to be photocopied for use as handouts or overheads so there is no color inside. There are 177 pages including answers in the back. It would be a good book for a critical thinking homeschool class or to use to work at home with a child after school."
5,Delightful pirate tale with all the trimmings.,"A wonderful yarn with every pirate image, trope, name, idiom, and stereotype from every pirate book, play and movie popping up; if you can imagine all the 17th century sea adventure stories rolled into one, you'll get the idea. While in many hands such an over-the-top concept would prove dull and predictable, Fraser manages to keep it moving by taking absolutely none of it seriously. This is one of the most fun books I've read in some time."
4,Huge fun,"A dizzying, action-packed yarn that takes us from England to the Caribbean via Madagascar, with a cast of pirates, heroes, villains, lovable rogues, heroines and vixens. As the author cheerfully tells us, great liberties are taken with history (among other things). It's a wild blend of all the pirate stories the author devoured in his childhood, mixing historical figures and events with great dollops of deliberate anachronism.A real romp, and definitely not to be taken seriously. I prefer Fraser's ""Flashman"" books, with their carefully rendered historical background to the anti-hero's misadventures, but this was great fun."
4,"A funny, funny parody","George MacDonald Fraser of ""Flashman"" fame has turned his attention to the pirate genre, with hilarous results. As with his ""Flashman"" books, the story is tongue-in-cheek with the reader in on the joke, as the characters are literal characiatures from pirate stories of film and print. (In fact, many of the settings of the story are written as if from a script.) The book's plot is over-the-top, and it is a fun read. Recommended."
4,Avast!,"I love this book. My copy is so tattered and ragged now that I'm relieved to see its still in print. Other reviewers have gone into the plot in detail, so all I'll say is that we have to get Peter Jackson to make the movie."
4,Goes from slow to twisted; keep watching and you won't stop.,"This anime did start out pretty slow and I almost gave up on watching it, but Im glade I didn't because it turned out pretty good. Give a try if you interested, but keep up with the story so you will understand whats going on. Its twisted. I liked it."
1,Uh-huh...,"Ok firstly, i'm not going to verbally abuse this series because i know there are peoply who will thoroughly enjoy it.I am a huge fan of horror (especially anime horror) but shiki didn't do it for me.I found it slow moving, boring, tedious and it wasn't scary or gory in my opinion.Every so often it would show a grotesquely drawn character for a split second and then i'd have to wait 6 episodes for anything remotely interesting like that to happen again.I didn't like the art style at all. The hair on pretty much every character set me into extreme fits of annoyance it was that bad.The characters are boring and live in a boring town etc etc.If your looking for a chilling psychological tale i would go with higurashi no naku koroni or ghost hound.If its gore your after then i recommend elfen lied or mnemosyne.I would pass on this one. if you do feel like you would still like to see it then download the first 5 or so episodes and then make up your mind before you decide to buy.Catch."
4,Good info but sketchy,"The book is OK but suffers a bit from being too short and rather scattered if considered to be an introduction to Islam. It might be best described as an introduction to the history of relations between Islam and the West.Bruce Bradshaw's review here is quite useful and accurate. The fact that the review discusses the tension between the Christian pacifist views of Yoder and those of Rheinhold Niebuhr, while the former is not even mentioned in the book, is illustrative of the spotty nature of the book. I'd really like to see an updated version, twice the length, with a lot of gaps filled. By now, seven years after the book was published, there must be better sources for reviewing the tensions between Muslim ""fundamentalism"" and Christianity."
5,Beautiful and touching,"Excellent screen version of John Steinbeck's short novel, with effective and renowned Aaron Copeland score to match. It's more than just a story about a boy and his love for his pony that gets sick and dies; it's about life and fitting in, about who we are and how we choose to be accepted. Everyone does a fine job on the screen. Best perhaps is Louis Calhern as Grandpa, who once led a wagon train across the plains. Robert Mitchum is the laconic ranch hand Billy Buck. Definitely worth a watch."
5,Red pony with white blaze makes boy blue...,"In an effort to connect with his son, Fred Tiflin (Louis Calhern) buys him a pony: A fantastic cinnamon red colored pony with a white blaze and a flowing creamy mane and tail. Fred is dismayed when young Tom (Peter Miles) turns to the ranch-hand (Robert Mitchum) instead of him for help in training the unbroken gelding and gets even more fed up when the pony, named Gabilan, becomes Tom's singular obsession. Drama and tragedy take center stage, but there is plenty of pony for fans of the Welsh breed. This movie was remade for TV in 1978, but somebody got the definition of ""pony"" confused with ""foal"" and a Thoroughbred colt was cast as Gabilan. Based on a short story called The Promise in a collection entitled The Red Pony by John Steinbeck.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,A look back in time,"If you are looking for a film that follows the book closely, you will be disapointed. Entire sections of the book were left out of the film and the character's names have been changed. Yet, the movie is well done and gives a unique look into early American rural life. The film was shot in the Santa Barbara region and gives a great insight into that area's scenery. I used the film in a class that I had taught and found it most fitting to show a comparison between the genre of novel and film."
5,Exquisito!,This book grabbed not only my time but also my whole being. Thank you Isabel. Life is a wonderful gift and this book helped me to appreciate even more its value.
5,A book for laugh and cry,"I think that this is the best book of Isabel Allende. For moments you don't know if the story is real or fiction, and makes you think about death and love.He leído el libro tres veces y cada una me ha hecho reir y llorar. Excelente libro.You have to read it."
5,Thank you Isabel,"Thank you Isabel for everything. I'm sorry but I'm Italian and it isn't easy explaine my emotion in English. You are fantastic, I love all your books. Thank you because when I'm depressed I think at you massime and my live go on... Ciao Barbara Gemignani"
5,touching and brilliantly written journey of self-discovery,"I read this book in most amazement at the magnificant discription of a life filled with trials and happiness. It really is an intimate account of her life which she has so graciousley put into words. It not only gives an insight into Isabel Allende's life but of a whole generation, a country and a woman's world. It really is a must read for all those looking to put the pieces of a puzzle together, and for those who can amire a beautfiully composed book."
5,Life-Affirmation,"I first read Isabel Allende when my friend's mother recommended ""The House of the Spirits."" Later, I told my friend's mother how much I had enjoyed the novel. On that occasion she handed me her copy of ""Paula,"" saying, ""Hear. Read this."" I obliged. ""Paula"" is the author's autobiography, written for her daughter, as she tries to nurse her daughter through a rare illness that has left her comatose. Allende visits the events in her past as she copes with the present. ""Paula"" moved me on many different levels. Allende's story of her own past is captivating. Her present day struggle to heal her daughter is heartwrenching. Despite the sadnesses of the book, it is a book that affirms life. I read it whenever I feel have wallowed in self-pity for too long. It reminds me that it is I who am in charge of my destiny. After crying the many tears I cry when I read ""Paula,"" I feel cleansed, rejuvenated, and ready to live life again."
4,this autobiography reads like a novel,"I found this book deeply moving, witty, and beautifully eloquent -- being, like Isabel Allende, also a Chilean living in the Bay Area, I was able to identify with so much in this exquisitely written autobiography... The narrative never lost me for one moment. I think it's her best book to date - in spite of how much I liked 'The House of the Spirits'"
3,powerfully written & poignant -- then falls flat,"Allende conveys the agony and the big questions of life so powerfully throughout. If you have not yet faced adversity in life, read it. If you have, read it. One caveat, towards the end, the writer seems self-absorbed, annoyingly so, and that serves to discount the previous pages so beautifully written"
4,Not her best but still very good,"Isabel Allende is hands down my favorite author primarilybecause of her incredible gift with language. Paula was notwritten as well as others such as the Infinite Plan or Eva Luna,but I believe that the emotions toward her daughter were sostrong that the prose was not the issue, but the feelings were.As another reviewer wrote, the mother/daughter bond was incrediblypowerful in the book and I could feel the seesaw of emotions ashope appeared and then fell away. There is no doubt that thisbook is worth the read for anyone."
5,get out the tissue box,"This is an absolutely brilliant book. I have reads hundreds, if not thousands, of books and this is the only one that has ever made me cry. Allende's story is more moving than I can describe. Read it and weep, then go buy a copy for your mother. That's what I did."
1,Not what we expected,We ordered the book in spanish and the book came in english. the pages were really yellow and some were tore. The book was nnot worth the money i spent. The description on the book said great condition and It was not at all.
5,Good book!,perfect writing skill! It should be a sad story but you don't feel sad~ It's a nice book that everyone should buy it~
3,Fans of Allenda will understand; others won't.,"I am a fan of Isabel Allende, so objectivity is out the window. Having a daughter that I dote on does not help. Allende's sadness and anguish are palpable. And it is hard for the reader to avoid being sucked into Allende's construction of context for Paula's fate. In the end, though, it doesn't work... The emerging endpoint obscures the supernatural thread, and the elegant, simple lines of storytelling so characteristic of Allende. There is a rambling aspect, that, while touching considering Allende's crisis, seems more cathartic than artistic. And the ending seems as though it belongs in another book (and I suspect that is what has happened). Isabel: My heart is with you, but.."
2,tedious,"I was all set to LOVE this book based on the reviews and recommendation of friend. Although heart wrenching and almost unbelievable with such prosaic description of emotions, I did find this book tedious. I usually LOVE Isabel Allende books, since her writing is beautiful, but won't recommend this book or pass it on without qualifying my opinion."
2,Rambling and long winded,The author jumps right in with characters that are colorful but at the same time made it confusing to keep track of them all. I found the descriptions of her upbringing and home life very insightful. I was hoping to learn more about the disease that her daughter was afflicted with yet not much detail was given at all. This book might have held my interest more if the author had thought to break some of her writing into paragraphs. I found myself thinking that I was reading one long sentence after a while.
1,Very Gloomy,"I had enjoyed Daughter of Fortune so much, that I thought that Paula would be great. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.Although there are some wonderful passages looking into Isabel's past, too much of the book deals with her socialist and new age perspectives of life. Her writing depicts a very self-centered life. Unfortunately, she is never able to come to grips with her daughter's coma and eventual death. Her writing has been sadly affected by events and her personal outlook."
2,Starts out great,"This book started out really well. Like Allende's otherbooksthe readers become involved with characters immediately. By theend, however, the story has bogged down and is only Allende rambling on about herself. She seems very impressed with herself and seems to believe that we should find anything she writes facinating. Stick to fiction! END"
1,A Barmy One Needs Help,"I wish sellers would give more information about their books, what year published and define the conditions better or if the book is hardcover or paperback. I am trying to order one for a friend and did but it's 1974 and wasn't stipulated at time of purchase. Are there any more current dated ones?"
5,This is our new favorite cookbook.,This cookbook hardly gets put back on the shelf--we're always looking for something else to make in it. Every sandwich we've made has been so good they taste like we've ordered out. This is a great cookbook.
3,Not what I was expecting,"We are HUGE Junie B Jones fans, so when we had read nearly all of those, I was thrilled to find a whole new set of Barbara Park books. I figured they would be just as hysterical, but with different characters.We haven't liked these nearly as much. Just not that funny. Still well written, but just not the one the girls run to when its story time every night."
2,The Blakeney Family Continues...,"Pimpernel and Rosemary may be a disappointment to Baroness Orczy's fans. The plot does not revolve around Sir Percy. Rather, it is about his great-great grandson. Sadly, Peter Blakeney lacks the style and mannerisms of his famous ancestor. The work also lacks luster in terms of plot development. On the positive side, the piece does have a few interesting romantic moments between Peter and Rosemary."
5,A Divine Read for Pimpernel Fans,"This is a definite must-read for fans of Orczy and her 'Pimpernel' series. While it's true that it takes place three generations after the famous stories of Sir Percy, this book definitely contains the same level of intriguing plot-twists and romance. The story, in ways, is similar to the original 'Scarlet Pimpernel,' but different enough to keep a reader interested and on his/her toes."
5,Organic chemistry,The book was just as described and was shipped quickly. The binding and pages looked great! Very happy with the purchase!!
2,For die-hard Bonanza fans only,"The class act in classic TV westerns seems to be Have Gun Will Travel, which works on many levels and effectively engages the modern audience. Bonanza fans may appreciate the excellent DVD transfer, gorgeous settings and selection of episodes in this product. But the rest of us would be better advised to select something with vision and adult-level dialogue going for it."
5,"A complete, concise, clinicians guide to poisonings.","Olson brings together experts in medicine, pharmacology and toxicology to produce a masterful guide to poisoning and overdose. This book is written for the bedside clinician and provides a rapid guide to specific exposures, kinetics and treatment. Items are generally one page or less and contain the elements you need to care for your patient. Other books have more information but Olson gives you what you need quickly and in a very concise format."
4,Good for the price.,"The only con is that it doesn't have any pockets, which I knew before I made the purchase. Another color might be useful."
3,Rain Shield O2,This jacket is very light and not very durable but is very nice to have along on a bike or kayak trip. It is a good jacket for the price.
4,Great Racquet,I really like this racquet. It is light and easy to use. It took me a while to get used to it because it required a little more swing power that my previous Head racquet. I still highly recommend it though.
1,Not Good,This is a very poor quality and one of the most uninteresting travel DVD I have ever seen! The picture quality is poor and material terrably outdated.It does not convey the true livelyness of Italy.
3,DVD release 2005 - But Image Quality of bad VHS,"This was one of the better programs I saw to prepare yourself for a trip to Italy. That said, be prepared that the image quality of this feature looks like VHS from 1985. The feature remains pretty much on the surface of the tourist attractions, with some little historical extras, but it is not a real educational masterpiece."
2,Doesn't taste like H&S Midsummer's Peach,"I was very excited to be able to get the Midsummer's Peach because it's been unavailable from Harney & Sons for a while now. I drank it so much that I used to buy it in bulk directly from them. When this tea arrived I quickly brewed up a cup and couldn't believe it was the same tea! The flavor was overwhelming, jarring, not subtle. Maybe this is the last stash that has aged poorly. Anyway, if you like Harney & Sons' Midsummer's Peach this won't be your nostalgia tea."
4,"Funny, Engaging and Informative","I was prompted to read this book because I have a deep fascination with the cultural aspects of death. Little did I realize it would turn out to be a great story with interesting characters, an intriguing plot, and LOTS of really amazing behind-the-scenes detail about what goes on at a funeral home. Like the show Six Feet Under, much of the plot stems from the conflict between the independent funeral home and the big conglomerate. The way in which the independent guys deal with this problem is suspenseful and exciting (I don't want to give anything away, but it's cool). My only real complaint with the book is the relationship between Casey and Natalie, which seems somewhat simple and contrived. Other than that, the book is really good: atmospheric, clever and really, really funny. Of course, if you are sensitive about death or just don't want to know the things that are going to happen to your body when your gone, you probably shouldn't read it."
5,The real gift,"Throughout this book we find that Casey Kight has ""the gift"" and after you have read this truly wonderful complete and amazing novel you must agree that the author Miles Keaton Andrew has ""the gift"" in abundance. If you have never read any book about the dismal trade of undertaking read this one, and if you are at all like me you will sit there and read it in one sitting it is just that good. One minute you are laughing out loud, turn the page and you are reaching for a tissue. Very few books do that to me, and this one did. Now to sit and wait and hope for another book from Miles Keaton Andrew."
3,Final Arrangments,I found this book to be Ok but it really wasn't what I thought and alot of fiction in it.But I liked the read anyway.
3,overrated,"I thought this book was going to be very special due to incredible praise on the jacket from prominent southern writers (comparing the protagonist to Huck Finn!!!) but the book falls far short of its billing. It was OK, nothing great. I probably would have liked it better had my expectations not been so ludicrously raised by publicity..."
5,The Perfect Book for a rainy day,"This book is THE best Vintage book I've ever read! It's as if you're feeling the same as what she's feeling...and if you're in for a good cry, this is the book for you! It's very powerful, very emotional and Ellen's whole outlook in life is just TOO real. Please, coming from a 15 yr. old. ELLEN FOSTER deserves your time!!!"
2,It was an okay book.,"I'm afraid that I found this book to not live up to the hype that was delivered by so many different sources. I will agree that it portrayed Ellen well, as well as some of the other characters, but I just did not like it. I thought some attempts at humor completely ruined the mood of a scene in an otherwise somber place in the novel.After reading this book, I will say that it offered a new perspective on Ellen's and other Foster children's situations, but again, I return to the fact that some bad elements caused me to get an overall negative feeling about the book. I suppose that I may be a bit harsh in such a low grade, but this is truly how it felt to me."
5,A Depressing but Good Book!!!,"I recently read this book and was very impressed.Ellen is born into a difficult family.When her mother dies, and her father continues to drink Ellen sees how unhappy she is. Instead of suffering painfully, she goes out to find her own happiness. I would clearly recommend this book:)"
4,Great Book.,This book is wonderful book. A little short but it does get the story across in a great way. Ellen Foster is young girl who has to go through more struggle and pain in her life then anyone her age should have to.The author made Ellen seem so real like it was someone you had know for a while and was just telling there life story. I wish the book could have been a bit longer but like I said it was just great.
3,Too Much in Too Little,"""Ellen Foster"" is the tale of an eleven-year-old girl who is forced into adulthood all too early. After her mother's death, her abusive father neglects her and she dreams of ways in which to kill him. She eventually goes through a series of foster care situations (hence the last name of Foster), and suffers the abuse as well as the kindness of strangers.The novel is a brief read and perhaps that is part of its downfall. Kaye Gibbons tries to cram too much into too little. People have commented on old Ellen's actions and what befalls her. Yet some of what occurs in her life is too fantastical to believe, even for a southern novel. She suffers so much at all times, that after a while, the reader is bogged down with no chance of breaking the surface. While Gibbons is able to weave vivid characters (such as Ellen's poor ""friend"" and her elderly aunt), she doesn't ground them in reality and they remain unbelievable."
2,I didn't get it,"It was rambling. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but it didn't happen. Maybe the author's writing style is not for me."
2,Short story?,"This book is just strange. It's a diary of a young girl that is hard to figure out. There is no conclusion to this story, it just kind of stops like half the book is missing. You can read it in one sitting if that's what you are looking for, buy it."
4,Very Good Book,"This book is the story of Ellen. Her mother dies; her father is an alcoholic. It is a very good book. I also like the character of Starletta. The book is not quite as good as ""A Virtuous Woman"" which is really superb."
4,Difficult to read...in more ways than one,"At 11, Ellen is already too familiar with the world's harshness. After surviving her mother's suicide and her father's abuse and neglect, Ellen is thrust upon various relatives who alternately neglect and play mind games with the solitary little girl none wants. Finally, Ellen understands she can't depend upon anyone other than herself; if she is ever to make any sort of life for herself, she must take action herself.While the story is told through Ellen's childish and rural eyes believably enough, that same writing style also makes it difficult to follow. Gibbons does not use quotes, and attempts to write as a confused little girl might speak and think -- resulting in an often disjointed work. Nonetheless, this book received critical acclaim for good reason, and I'd highly recommend giving it a try."
1,Ellen Shmellen,"On behalf of Mrs. Dymond's ninth grade English class at GHS, I would like to say that Ellen Foster is the worst book ever. It continuously goes on about the horrors of Ellen's life and her horrible father and dead mother and how sad poor little pyschotic Ellen is. It has no point, it's sappy, and it's annoying. Our teacher made us read it and all the normal people hated it. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK WHATEVER YOU DO! Thank you....."
1,Terrible book,"1. This book is tremendously boring. Makes me want to blow my head off.2. The style of writing is confusing.3. The girl just rambles on forever (Complaining/Whining).4. The author attempts to write like a 4 year old, but it turned out to be a failure.5. The author does horrible job by keep changing the subject from past to present.6. Kaye Gibbons, please do not make any books like Ellen Foster!7. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! WASTE OF TIME!"
1,CONFUSING,"This book was the most lackluster book I have ever read. It was not only boring it was difficult, the Author is constantly switching from the past to the present which makes for terriblle reading, I would definetly not recommend this book!"
1,One of the first books I have read...,"by Kaye Gibbons and if this is the line along which her books follow, it will be the last! I was so bored with this book.. bored and DISGUSTED! Isn't there enough crap in this world without having to read about it like that.. Hard enough to know it really does happen, but to dwell on it and actually applaud someone for writing about sick things such as this book. Very disturbing society we live in."
4,A wonderful novel.,"I recommend reading this novel, if you like reading about families living in a dysfunctional home. Ellen Foster is a short novel about a little girl Ellen living in a dysfunctional family. She is living with her drunken abusive father, since her mother lies peacefully in gods hands. She has her friend (Starletta) who really cares for her and so does Starletta's family. Ellen realizes that the friendship she has with Starletta helped her get on with her life. The best part of this book is that it describes everything that might happen in a broken home and I could just feel what she is going through. The worst was how she talks about killing her own father, but I would not blame her."
2,Nothing special,"I heard a lot of hype about this book about how moving it was, but generally I found that this book was extremely boring and slow-moving. If your teacher assigns this for school, try to pick another book because even though it's a short book I had to struggle to stay awake."
3,ellen foster.,"I read this book a while back, and enjoyed it. It is told through the eyes of a child, as she goes through hardship after hardship. Finally, she rises above all that and comes to find that not everyone is like her father, and all the others who wronged her. This is a book about tolerance, love, acceptance, and belonging. I give it three stars!"
5,Excellent book; superbly written,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I was bowled over by the expert way in which Gibbons conveyed, through the naive & simple eloquence of Ellen's authorship, the astoundingly simple & balanced outlook of this 11 year old living with her two utterly dysfunctional (and thankfully nearly invisible) parents and other clueless family members. Ellen's innocence and strength, with seemingly unintended humor, made me want to know her as a friend. I wish the book didn't end, but had sequel after sequel."
4,Ellen Foster Has an Indomitable and Resilient Spirit,"This is a first novel about a spunky and high-spirited girl who marches ahead in life despitethe terrible circumstances which befall her.Ellen Foster is a survivor - - she survives her mother's suicide, a drunken father, several fos-ter homes, and crazy and cruel relatives. She has an inquiring and indomitable spirit. Thisbook is a real homage to resiliency."
2,Right - who is this girl ???,"There were just too many inconsistencies in this girl to have the story be believable. She supposedly had a mother (for most of her life) who had a wealthy (at least middle class) family. She is totally illiterate and totally a racist even though there doesn't appear to be any racism from her parents (where did she get this). I mean she wouldn't even eat food at her black friend's house. The setting appears to change from the early 70s to the late 80s. She is supposed to be so saavy but we are supposed to believe that she wasn't familiar with the term ""foster family"" and that no social worker explained it to her. I found the poor grammar to be annoying and not even believable. ( I guess we are supposed to believe this girl didn't go to school even though we are also supposed to believe she is pretty smart). I can't recommend this book."
2,Disappointing,"Having read numerous Oprah selections and having heard all the hype about this novel, I opened Ellen Foster with great expectations. But to my disappointment, these expectations were far from reached. Rarely do I have to push myself to finish a novel, but was forced to do so with this one. Slow, monotone, and emotionless, I found it difficult to sympathize with Ellen's tragic story. The underdeveloped and almost expressionless characters, the underemphasized setting, the lack of dialogue and insight to Ellen's pain--all were severe drawbacks to the potential of this heartbreaking story. And although this is a matter of personal taste, I must also comment on the fact that the continuous use of poor grammar and language throughout the book were a pain. Sorry. I don't recommend it."
2,"Not bad, but not great","This book is written in the perspective of a young girl. The grammar is intentionally incorrect throughout the book, and this is why I had a hard time staying interested. I bought this book because it had the Oprah's Book Club symbol on the cover and I thought it might be a good read. I really didn't care for it."
3,Funny...tragic...from the perspective of a 12 year old girl,"Out of the mouths of babes...Gibbons relates her tale through the mind of the 12 year old ""victim"" who lives an existence that no one should. The tone and language are terrific. It delivers one back in to the pre-adolescent years whether or not you had that type of childhood or not -- hopefully not! Downside is the disjointed flow of the novel...the reader is sometimes confused as to timeframe as the book bounces back and forth. Otherwise, an enjoyable quick read."
5,Heartwarming and Inspirational,Ellen Foster is about a young girl who grows up in an abusive family. It takes you through her life and shows you what she had to live with. I was very impressed with the way Kaye Gibbons expressed Ellen's feelings. I recommend it for everyone to read.
4,LIfe of a troubled eleven year old,"This book started out slow, but as I continued to read it, I could not put it down. Poor Ellen Foster, to go through what that eleven year old girl had gone through was amazing. It was so lifelike, and at times actually brought tears to my eyes. Being shifted from one home to another. The only part of this book that was a little disapointing to me was, I would of liked to of known what happened to Ellen. Yes she finally found a home, but what happened to her later on? Could there be a Ellen Foster #2?"
5,Ellen Foster,This is a fantastic novel written by Kaye Gibbons about a foster child. The book is a flashback story about Ellen who's mother overdoses on pills and she's left with an abusive father. GO BUY THIS BOOK!
4,Michael Hilliard's Review of Ellen Foster,"I thought this was a good book, and that all English Teachers should make their students read it. Even though it was basically a long homework assignment for me, I still enjoyed it. It had a good plot, and a great meaning to it. It showed how sturdy one child could be when faced with many adversities. It was a pleasure reading this book!"
1,Less Than I Expected,"After hearing all the praise regarding this book from the other reviewers, I thought I'd add a few warnings to those of you thinking of devoting your valuable time to it.--Not much as far as plot goes, and although I liked some of the supporting characters I didn't particularly find Ellen very interesting or well-delveloped. She thinks like a 40 year old and talks like a 4 year old--not what I find realistic for someone who is supposed to be about 11. No, I did not grow up poor or abused or with bad language skills (which is something you must also suffer through during most of this book, since the book is written from the main character's point of view), so maybe I can't identify. Overall, I guess it doen't really take that long to read, but I kind of wish that I hadn't taken the time."
1,"""This book is so boring, I couldn't even read the Spark Notes""","We had to read this book in English class last semester. This is actually the worst book I have ever read. I am not exaggerating one bit. A kid in my class said one day ""This book is so boring, I couldn't even read the spark notes"". This book would make sense if everyone in the South was an insestious alchoholic. When its not talking about some depraved act, Ellen is rambling on and on about her ""new mama"" in such a way; its like the author was trying to be excrutiatingly boring. The idea that anyone could say anything possitive about this book is astoudning; if i had a 16 hour plane flight, and all I had was this book to read, I would still not read it."
4,And you thought your childhood sucked,"I was impressed by this fictional sordid tale of the South and its world -weary child narrator.Ellen has such an awarness of life and exactly how it operates.Her resilience, foresight and determination were amazing and I believe they came not only from the survival instinct, but from a keen perception into human nature and the world around her.The prose was realistic and delicious. And I was thrilled there was a happy ending for Ellen after all."
3,Ellen Foster,"I found by experience and by reading this book that as a child, you live your life. And it doesn't seem so bad at the time, you just go on. When grown you think ""Boy, did I live that life, that's bad, but I conquered it and went in the right direction and my life turned out good!!"" There are a lot of us who have grown up this way so it was heartwarming to read it in print. I would recommend it to teenagers and young adults."
4,Elen Foster,"Ellen Foster is a realistic fiction book written by Kaye Gibbons. Kay Gibbons wrote this book about this girl, Ellen Foster, and is thaat she hates her dad. Her dad is always drinking and he never lisens to what she has to say. One of the reasons why she hated her father so much is because he did not do anything to stop her mom from killing herself. She took a lot of pills in front of him and he did not do anything to stop her. He also dies in this story. So she goes to live with another family, but now she is way better off living there. This book was very difficult to read for me. I had to keep going back to the dictionary because there were some hard words that i didnt understand. I would put this book in a medium level, leaning more to the hard side.This book wwas very difficult and long."
4,I thought that this is very emotional and very sad.,The main Character Ellen learns alot of things in this book . She learned how to be more friendly to other races and she learned how to deal wit hher drunk and drug addict father .Ellen had to learn to find a new home after her parents died . In this book I learned that people always have bigger problems than you .
4,Excellent book about children's resillence,"Ellen Foster is an excellent book about children's abilities to overcome adversity, even when it seems impossible to see hope. Ellen is an insiteful, funny, creative, and determined little girl who takes control of her life and finds a home and people to love her. She doesn't dwell on her hardships and hard luck, but makes her life better through determination and perseverance. Ellen Foster is a must read especially for teachers, to remind us of what some of our children are up against, as well, as, remind us to get to know our students."
5,An excellent choice!,I thought the book was excellent. I couldn't put it down. It really made me realize how rough some kids had it growing up and how lucky I was to grow up in such a loving home.
2,Too confusing to make sense,"Well, I read this book, and the writing style really got to me. Ellen is pretty much just a bigoted kid who won't even lie on the bed of her African-American friend. I have no clue why Oprah chose it to her book club, it's downright impossible to read unless you are in second grade and you are not familiar with quotations. I will be forgetting this one in a while..."
3,Pretty good!,"I was disappointed after reading this. After all the hullabaloo about it on Oprah's show I was expecting some mini mastepiece. Unfortunately it is not that. It's still pretty good though, just not as good as A Virtuous Woman or as good as they say."
5,"Ellen Foster, strong, couragous, loveable, liveable.","Ellen Foster is indeed a short novel, yet ""old Ellen's"" life is forever lingering in my mind. Kaye Gibbons wrote an incredibily lovable novel, one that is sure to steel your heart and give you strength. We all have troubles in our lives, and most of the time we wished we could change ourselves or our situation. I do not recall Ellen Foster ever wishing to be a different person, yet she strives to better her life and condition after her mother passes away. Ellen has given me comfort and strength to look into my own past and gain strength and knowledge from it. Ellen Foster is a book I encourage all who can absorb the love of one's true life of independence and courage."
5,Proves big things comes in small packages!,"I must say for such a ""little"" book, it packs a wallop. It is the story of an 11 year old girl name Ellen Foster. Her location and time the story takes place is never really specified, but it's not needed. This novel is about the heart of a young girl who longs for a nice home, a mother, and a little attention. Ellen Foster tells you of her life after her mother's death to her present time, and all of the trials that she's had to endure. This is not a novel of a pity party. It's a chance to meet a nice, smart, remarkable young woman. Who doesn't look at the world through rose colored glasses and is able to still appreciate life. I'm glad I finally got to meet Miss Ellen, it was indeed a pleasure."
5,A study of a resilient child,"You will fall in love with the title character of Kaye Gibbons's Ellen Foster. Throughout the novel, Ellen's most dominant character trait is self-preservation. From the first page to the last, she reveals and demonstrates the backbone and resilience necessary for a child thrown into challenging circumstances.Gibbons structures the novella around a series of temporal shifts between the present situation of the narrator (the now of the story) and the past situation of the character (the then of the story). The story, in effect, becomes a gradual diminishing of the distance between these two temporal settings.As the story of Ellen Foster's difficult childhood and her remarkable resilience is parceled out to the reader through fifteen chapters, another story--a story about a child's understanding of race and decency--is told as well.Like J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, Ellen Foster is a story for people of all ages."
3,Overrated.,"Ellen Foster carries with it a fairly hefty reputation, but truly this thin work bears the evidence of its grad school origins quite obviously. An exercise in voice, nothing more."
3,"It was okay, enjoyed A Virtuous Woman much better....","I read this in one day, finding it a quick, light read. Unfortunately, I did not really feel taken in by the novel, though Ellen was cute. I think Gibbons' message regarding Starletta's plight nice, rather normal, though. Check out A Virtuous Woman or Hoffman's Here on Earth for a similar, more enjoyable read."
3,"Mediocre, but influential","Despite the overly dense descriptions and some irritating lead characters, this book is worth reading just to see how much it has influenced others."
2,mediocre,"This was a quick, easy read, but I can't say that I enjoyed it particularly. I found the writing style to be distracting. It was a good story that needed to be developed a lot more than it was. Had I have known that it was a movie, I would have watched it and probably would have enjoyed it more. Not a horrible book, but I would recommend it only with caution."
5,Fantastic!,I'm seventeen years old and just read Ellen Foster and I just couldn't put it down. It was sooooo wonderful and it moved me so much that I gave it to my mom to read. This book I would suggest everyone to read!! It does not matter how old you are.....It's excellent!
4,Bone meets Holden Caulfield,"Ellen Foster is a character in the tradition of Dorothy Allison's ""Bastard Out of Carolina"" and Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye."" Kaye Gibbons' approach, to write entirely in the voice of her main character, serves the book's purpose well. Although Ellen's voice sometimes makes her storytelling confusing and vague, especially early in the novel, the book is often beautifully wrought and subtle. It is sometimes humorous, often heartbreaking, and simply written. A nice compliment to Salinger's overwrought prose and Allison's brutal forthrightness. This book ranks right up there with those other two works and in fact is probably better suited for high-school age readers than either. Not perfect, but well worth the read."
4,Love Kaye Gibbons writing style!!,"The Author's writing style was simply suburb. Reading this book with it's 1st person narrative was a delightful experience. The story about Ellen and her tragic but uplifting life ought to be a lesson to all who read this. From the mouth of an eleven year old she told her story simply but eloquently that life needs not be the tragedy it may start out to be. The only thing I can fault the author for is that sometimes Ellen says and thinks things an eleven year old probably never would have. I found more of an adult line of thinking in many instances involving Ellen. But, that aside Kaye Gibbons wrote a wonderful, wonderful story. And, for those who thought Ellen to be a bigoted little girl must not have finished the book or missed the whole ending."
4,Quick but Detailed Read,"At a little over 100 pages, I didn't think this book would have much plot or character development. I was wrong. This is a really good book. It took me a bit to understand Ellen's verbal syntax, but once I got into her rhythm of speech, I understood her more fully, too.Kaye Gibbons created a narrator in Ellen who left me wishing Ellen the best. What will happen to her?! Hopefully, only good things."
1,I can't understand what the hype is all about.,"Getting to the end of a good book is always a little sad to me because I want the experience and the characters to keep going. But when I was reading this book, I kept checking to see how many pages were left for me to struggle through. It was only 126 pages, but it took me over two weeks to force myself to read all the way to the disappointing ending. I found her style of writing to be extremely confusing. A single sentence seemed to ramble on and on and the book would keep switching time and location without giving the reader a clue that it had. The author's choice not to use quotation marks around any direct quotes just added to the confusion. On top of all of this, I was never moved enough to even slightly care what happened to any of the characters. Sorry, Ms. Gibbons, but I found your book a laborious and disappointing read."
2,"Sorry, didn't work for me","This book was given to me by a good friend. The two of us almost always agree about books, and she recommended ELLEN FOSTER highly. She greatly admires Kaye Gibbons' writing. Unfortunately, this book didn't work for me. First of all, I hated the writing. Difficult to interpret, difficult to read, I found myself frowning and too often left wondering what in the world Gibbons meant to say. The story itself is nothing new. I've read others in the same vein that I enjoyed more. And the ending left me frowning again. Huh? was my reaction. Since when did racial injustice have anything to do with this story? I felt as if Gibbons just threw that part in at the end to give the story moral weight, but since the only reference to race was in Ellen's reluctance to eat anything made by Starletta's mother, I just didn't buy it. Different strokes for different folks . . ."
4,Simple but Captivating,"This short, simple but superbly written novel of an unloved and uncared for child pulled at my heartstrings. This child's tale of abuse and neglect, whilst a work of fiction, is probably all too frequent an occurence in reality. But Ellen has an inner strength that many of us might find hard to achieve even in adulthood. This is a story well worth the read."
5,Original and powerful,"You know that there is something different about this book from the time you open it. Ellen's blunt statements and the oddly punctuated text leave an immediate impression on you.The book's heroine is a young, headstrong girl who boldly faces her rough life. From all around her, ideas are thrown at her regarding everything from racism to her own self-worth, and yet Ellen is strong enough to be able to analyze these ideas for herself rather than take them for granted, and that is one of the reasons that she survives the rough journey presented in this book.The book is written from Ellen's perspective and stays true to her at all times. It is sometimes hilarious, but without being demeaning to her at all. You develop a kind of fondness for her, her toughness, her innocence; as well as the other characters.This is an absolutely beautiful story. Some people find it sad but I don't think it is in the least. It is actually rather uplifting."
2,"Either I'm a lazy reader, or this book is misty and tiresome","This is the kind of book they make you read in high school to help you learn about growing up. It's tiresome, repetitive, has a dreamy quality to it that makes the whole thing feel undefined. Sure, our heroine has a few cute quips and has a whimsical resourcefulness. But it doesn't sustain the book as a ""good read"" as far as I'm concerned. Or maybe I'm a lazy reader, considering how acclaimed the book seems to be. In any event, I can't recommend it."
4,The ending was anti-climactic,"I found the end to be rather anti-climactic, however this was a good book...very brief."
2,Ellen Foster was dissappointing.....to say the least...,"Ellen Foster wasn't well written, in my opinion. Not only were Kaye Gibbons' thoughts abstract and random as they were written, but they were disorganized and confusing to read. The subject material and the focus of the story with its many themes was not original (however fine). As another reviewer mentioned, ""there is not a quotation mark to be found"". This I agree with completely. This makes the dialouge hard to follow. Without at least a slight sense of order, the story loses its power, influence, and impact."
1,Yawn,"This might be a great book if I could have gotten into it but it just bored me to sleep. I tried SEVERAL times to get into the book but it was completely forced, and I couldn't do it. If the book description on the back sounds interesting to you, then give it a try, but if someone gives it to you saying you just have to read it, make sure you really want to do it, cause it may be just a big waste of time."
2,SLOW GOING,"I STARTED READING 'ELLEN FOSTER' A FEW DAYS AGO..I THINK IT IS VERY SLOW AND HARD TO KEEP UP WITH...I THOUGHT THAT AS I GOT INTO THE BOOK IT WOULD EVENTUALLY SPEED UP, BUT IT DID NOT..I MAY TRY AGAIN LATER. THIS IS NOT THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN A WHILE...I READ CONSTANTLY"
3,Ellen Foster sweet story,"This was a sweet story, heartfelt and pure. So true to how many children ,regardless of race or creed feel in a home they are not loved ."
5,You need to read this book!,Kaye Gibbons is a gifted writer. She accomplished in Ellen Foster that which Faulkner attempted; easy to follow stream of consciousness writing.
1,Insulting,"I would just like the Amazon website to know that it is verypainful for me to see Peter David being given credit fora Harlequin romance novel he didn't write. I did a search under Peter David and this book is listed under Peter David's name, but Peter David did not write this novel. This is a production of someone named Kay David, not Peter. If you would correct that it'd be great, thanks."
5,Sea Monkeys!!!,"Great product and really fun to have on your desk at work. Come-on, who wouldn't love a beach themed Sea Monkey tank of their own?"
3,Sea Monkeys,Product is much smaller than we realized. Our first batch of sea monkeys did not hatch but retailer shipped out replacements which we hope will hatch...We're hoping they are as fun as most people say they are.
4,Super Cute,"This Sea Monkey World is super cute. It definitely gets the attention it deserves. The scene it just too cute. It is a little bit bigger than most SM tanks, but still great for almost any space. Your guests or co-workers will love it. Kids will love it! Great for all ages. **Buy & Use the ""million bubble aerator"" everyday, for longer SM life!**"
3,Outdated,"I love Lucy Lippard's writings, but this book is hopelessly outdated, detailed primarily the work of Anglo artists playing at Neo-Paganism."
3,"Interesting, but draw your own conclusions","This is a thoroughly researched book at one middle school. Be careful taking the insights as generalizations. It uses good stories and provides lots of information, but makes no judgments or suggestions as to how to help your middle school student or what works with them. It also seems almost dated in reference to technology since it has already progressed to the point where most middle schoolers have cell phones, text messaging, email, etc. On the positive side, the study into relationships between parents and middle schoolers and friends is thought-provoking."
2,Not as I was expecting,"I suppose I was looking for a ""how to deal with it"" from an someone educated in the field. This was more like a ""here's what happened in this school"" book. I was left saying to myself, ""That's what happened in that school then. What about what is happening in schools in other regions of the country (which makes a huge difference), and how does a parent successfully respond to the changes and conflicts that my kid is going through?"" Some of the story lines were interesting, but did not help me at all. I regret buying the book."
3,Not Much...,"I was excited to pick up this book and get to reading. Shortly into it, I found I had trouble keeping track of who was who and was frustrated by the structure of the book. It got in my way of following the characters and holding my interest. With that said, even if you have the same trouble I did following characters, the book does serve as a good reminder of what kids are going through at that age and a bit of an eye opener to what more current topics and issues are.I feel it's view may be a limited one in that it only studies one school in one state. So, in general themes it may be insightful but in more specific terms - not so much. Additionally, I am not sure what all of Perlstein's qualifications are - I know she is an education journalist - what exactly that is, I am not sure. I know she immersed herself in Wilde Lake Middle School for a year... it reads more like a survey than what I was expecting."
1,Choose another book,"This book reads as if she has personal attacks to make on people involved in education, not as if she spent a year in a school. The book says she spend a year ""immersed"" in a school, but then in an interview she say she spent days here and there in the school. That's a lot different, and it's important to read the book from such a perspective, because if you are replying on the information to learn something about middle schoolers, you should know how much research did and did not go into this book."
1,same old stuff!,"If you have experienced being a parent of a child in middle school, you realize this book is just one of many on the subject. However, this one appears to include some really poor information in that it cannot be applied to all kids this age. The author has no idea how stupid this book sounds. Not worth the money!"
4,Good paleographical primer,"This is truly a 'pocket-sized' book, but well-made. It's a good introduction to paleography, and I've found it very useful. I use this in conjunction with online resources, which I appreciate but just aren't the same to me as an actual book. I purchased this one to aid in genealogical research."
4,The Classic Work on Werewolves,"100 years ago, Montague Summers, a Catholic priest in England, penned a five-volume history on the occult that covered vampires, witches, and, here, werewolves. Summers takes both his theology and his historical accounts very seriously. Make no mistake; he absolutely believes that black magic is real, and he is out to convince you. What makes his work so refreshing today is that it is unabashedly erudite and boldly, almost defiantly, orthodox. You don't have to agree with him to learn deeply from his research. People love him or hate him; personally, I can't get enough of the man. Get all five volumes!"
1,Werewolf Dissertation,"This book is written like a thesis paper. It's littered with so many quotes (and all are in the original language) and personal anecdotes by the author that you are left frustrated and utterly lost.I picked up this book because I enjoy the lore and legends behind things that go bump in the night, but this written well above the average readers comprehension level.This book is definitely for those who enjoyed De Litanea Minore.Didn't get that? My point exactly."
5,great overview,great overview from one of teh best rockabilly/roots bands of their time. It's a shame they don't go on. The third album before being cancelled showed promise to bring them to new heights with cuts like I Lie In Bed.
5,A Great Band,"One of the greatest bands out of Tampa Florida! A Family affair with Josh on vocals, his brother Schmokes with the guitar, and their sister Leah tearin up the bass! If that isnt cool in itself wait till you hear them. I really have enjoyed their album for the past several years and still play it regularly."
5,Goodbye smelly diapers!,This is an AWESOME product. We spray it on my 20 month old daughter's dirty diapers before disposing of them and it definitely makes a difference. I keep the large bottle on her dresser in her room and carry the small bottle in our diaper bag which is very nice to have when we're out and about. I specifically looked for a product that is non-toxic and am thrilled to have found one that works that is not dangerous. Will definitely keep buying this spray and please note that although expensive it works well and the bottle lasts a long time.
4,Can help with diaper odor.,"I liked this product overall but gave it 4 stars because we found it annoying to spray on every diaper before putting on my daughter. Plus, she frowned a bit at having a moist diaper put on.We decided to keep it handy for disposing of poopy diapers after the fact. We spray the diaper before folding and putting it in the bin and have found it to work well. We can continue using our Diaper Dekor for all diaper disposals rather than having to carry them out to the garage trash can."
2,Overratted,"I cannot understand all the positive reviews for this product. Not only is this product a bit tedious to use and an extra step to diapering - you have to spray dirty diapers before depositing in the diaper pail, but I don't sense much difference than not using anything at all, after using this for several months.At the price, it makes more sense to just spray diapers with Lysol before depositing. Don't waste your money."
1,Religious nonsense.,"Do not buy this book or any other ""Bibles."" Spend you money on books writen by Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens,and Richard Dawkins. You will be much better off."
5,Parallel Bible,"This Bible was purchased as a Confirmation gift. With so many different translations available, this Bible offers four of the most commonly used in a side by side format. It will give new insight and information as the words are compared. Having just completed a study of the Gospel of Matthew myself, this Bible would have been a valuable tool. The only drawbacks are its weight and size of type, but since this Bible contains both the Old and New Testaments, both are necessary. As usual, Amazon shipped quickly."
5,"Love this book, which you could show what parrallels you want",There should be an option to select the versions you want in a book. It was the closest I could find in a parallel to what I was looking for but the print and context is great. I use it every day to study the Word and learn more about the biblical history.
2,SORRY JOE BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME ....BORING !,"I am a fan of Joe Ely but this cd is boring lack luster no spark with sterile production, stick with love and danger or live at liberty lunch cd's that is the Joe Ely with grit and soul that kick's ass ! J.B."
5,Jo Ely,"I love Americans/country music, and Joe Ely is one of the best interpreters of it. Can never have too many of his cds."
3,Disapointed,I bought this book and was very excited when it arrived. When I started to read the book I became very disapointed. I felt that the book skimmed over the subjects. I thought I got a better explaination from the NICU unit then this book. I frowned at that the book only talked about breastfeeding moms and nothing about formula feeding moms. Overall the best way to describe my thoughts about this book is very disapointed. I hope this will help those moms out there that had a premie born before 34 to 36 weeks.
1,Very poor quality in low light,this camcorder cannot record in low or artificial light environment; the image is so bad that the faces become unrecognizable. Night shot or any other settings are competely useless. Bottom line: this DC100 is piece of junk
1,To me CANON stands for CANNOT,"This camcorder is a disgrace, operation manual is complicated, operation is weak on battery life, and the DVD has PC load issues, a total waste of money collecting dust for several years now because it's too burdensome to use, I'll never buy anything from Canon again, their printers always suck too, the cheap printer i bought makes a loud stripped gear sound and then mangles the paper or doesn't feed and Canon should be ashamed of themselves for price gouging us on short-lived ink cartridges. To me, CANON stands for CANNOT."
1,This is jumk,I bought this camera and got very little use from it. Now the power adaptor is not registered by the camera and will not charge the battery. I bought an external charger and the charged battery runs the camera but will not finalize the disks to be used by another device. Another adaptor that I bought does no better. I contacted Canon and they only have facility to repair at my cost. This is acceptable only if you expect about 12 hours of service before you have to pay to repair. If you want a camera to use for more than a brief time stay away from Canon.
4,Canon DC100 Camcorder,A little difficult to just pick up and start filming. But when reading the first few pages of the manual no problems at all.
4,Top product not so easy to use,"Canon's DC100 DVD Camcorder comes recommended as the top product of it's type and best buy. You can use it straight out of the box on automatic settings but it's a bit more difficult to set up for viewing on TV and computer than one might imagine. Not exactly a plug and play item. It's a hassle in many respects to learn how to use all the functions and to perform ordinary tasks. However for ease of use and convenience in size as far as filming go, I can't imagine there is a better item at a better price."
4,a good read,"i truly enjoyed this offering from ms. small. what i liked about this particular novel was the fact that the heroine, Aidan, was not the usual run-of-the-mill drop dead gorgeous beauty like most of the romance novels out there. she was attractive in her own right, strong willed, level headed and posessed a secret yearning for love. i was also thrillled with the idea of Conn her husband adopting the st. michael surname instead....that was refreshing!Aidan saw an opportunity that she dare not refuse and she grabbed it with outstretched arms willingly. the story travels from europe and crosses the ocean to an exotic land where our heroine is exposed to the tantilising sensual treats of the east.this book was a good read with an easy to follow storyline!"
5,A Love for All Time,"I absolutely loved this book, especially as I had read the two previous books in the Skye O'Malley series. Even though this story can stand alone it has so much more meaning if you have read the Skye O'Malley Saga from the first book. I love the way Bertrice Small interweaves her fictional characters with the real historical people of the time. Just when you think everything in the adventure is over and you are now at ""Happily Ever After"" time, the plot thickens and your are on to more wonderful adventure. It is hard to lay the book down. I am now reading the fourth book in the saga."
5,"Romantic, exciting, endearing!","I really enjoyed this book! It was sweet how Conn and Aidan fell in love with each other right away, and how despite everything they managed to keep their love for each other! The only throwback(unrealistic attitude), was that if her husband loved her so much why did he still continue to consider her plain of face? What made it kind of cruel was that everybody seemed to be throwing it into her face about her plain face. But definitely a good collection to the Skye O'Malley sagas!"
3,A little confusing to me,"Having heard so many women complain how men misuse them and see them only as sex objects it is a little difficult understanding why they so enjoy reading novels in which the heroine is so misued. It's as difficult for me to understand as these UFO fantasies of them being kidnapped by aliens and forcibly used for breeding.Case in point, here we have the heroine abducted and sold into white slavery. Stripped for examination. Debased and degraded and thrown into a harem.Eventually she's rescued but not before she has ejoyed it.Some of the stuff in here, such as the sexual misuse of underage girls turns me off. The twists in it though are facinating."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of the Skye series. This wasn't worthy of that series.Aidan isn't O'Malley, she is as pigheaded as an O'Malley, but hasn't their strength or there intelligence.She survives most of her slavery simply because she wasn't treated as a slave.. Once possessed by the Sultan, she turns suicidal. She literally goes insane.The only value in this book, to the Skye Series, is that it introduces Aidan's daughter. Valentina has her own adventures later."
5,A Love For All Time,"The book is classic Bertrice Small. I have enjoyed every book of hers that I have read, I carry one of her books with me everywhere I go. With my kindle I can pick up and go any time with all of her books, so I dont have to worry about what to read when I finish one."
2,Bummed....,"This review is for people who have already read the first books in this series. This book and it's characters started out very enjoyable; Conn was a very likeable gentleman & Aiden was a sweetheart. They seemed a good match & their romance was true.Unfortunately, as the plot got underway, the book followed the original ""Skye O'Malley"" so closely it became predictable. It was almost boring to read b/c Aiden had endured almost the same journey as Skye. Reading this the second time around wasn't as thrilling or nerve-racking. I know loyal fans are blinded by their love for the author, but this is a skippable story in the series, IMHO."
3,Good,A great comedian with a full length album with a running time that makes you feel as if you get your money's worth. Be warned though it may not be safe for work or children as Oswalt can get vulgar.
5,The Definitive Oswalt,"Of the 3 solo CDs Oswalt has released so far, this is the best. The writing is sharp, the performance is tight, the laughs are many.Oswalt must have thanked the Comedy Gods when he had the presence of mind to dismantle his heckler the way he did on this album. You don't get to hear that every day on an album.Terrific."
5,His best stuff yet.,Patton is just getting better and better. Absurd without being wacky. Smart without being pretentious. Political without being preachy.This is his best album yet. Buy it.Immediately.
5,Absolutely hilarious,"This entire album is absolute gold. The routines are tighter and punchier than the also-good ""Feelin' Kinda Patton"", and you also get to hear Mr. Oswalt dealing with an annoying audience member (bonus!). His humor isn't for everyone, but it's perfect for those that enjoy a little bit of bitterness and oddly specific word choices with their geeky rants.There were times that I had to pause the album because I was laughing so hard. In fact, I was listening to it in a car with some friends and the driver was cracking up so much that we had to switch back to radio, out of fear his shaking laugher would cause us to swerve into another lane and die a fiery, metallic death."
2,Way too abstract for me,"I didn't finish reading it. It was too abstract for me to follow the plot. And the tone is so angry that it's not even really believable. Maybe it would've been believable in the 1960s, perhaps as sort of a companion to The Yellow Wallpaper."
4,"Luna's True Love- or: ""A Better SM S Movie!""","First of all I would like to apologize for my opinion of SuperS 2. Yes, I disliked it, but it is my opinion! I refuse to give every book a 5 just because it is Sailor Moon! Now, on to Book 11. First off, before you open it- this book is seperate from the others. If you have a good understanding of who ALL the scouts are, even if you did not read Books 1-10, this is one of the rare books where you will understand the plot. And for those of you who have not read SuperS 4, that IS Luna on the cover. Now, on to the content. Have you seen the Sailor Moon S movie? (For those of you who read my DVD reviews, you know S is my fave season!)This is the same plot, only in book format and 10 times better! There is not enough space to review the last 1/3 of the book, but it is a short story about Rei. For Mars fans, you will love it. (By the way, I may be only 12, but I know my anime and manga. I have been a SM fan even before its US release.)"
2,disappointing -_-;,"this was a really disappointing one for me. it seemed very short to me, the characters arent introduced well, it's got a very confuzzleing part in it, and if your collecting all of these books to say that you have them, yeah sure go ahead and buy it. but if your looking for a good read, look else where. naoko has done better, ya know!!"
5,Great collection of a wonderful smell.,This collection has so many different items it was a real treat trying them all! Certainly a great buy!
2,Series one Harry Potter minis,"Well, I laughed at this toy when I got it for my Birthday!!!! Sirus and Harrys head popped off, the dementor is not posible at all, and the grim just sits there like a statue. I hated this toy. I just leave it on display on my desk in my room. I recomend that you buy super glue for this. Just in cast a head pops off!"
5,BOSCH LAMINATE BLADES,I USED THE BOSCH BLADES ON MY LAMINATE FLOORING AND THEY CUT THE LAMINATE LIKE BUTTER.
2,Cobraaaa!,"As a G.I. Joe fan and collector since 1986 I even enjoy watching the original series today. As a native German I liked both Joe and Cobras alike. Both factions owned a number of great characters! Some good guys some bad guys but all of them were unique!Though I generally like Manga-Style movies and especilly the female characters look cuter than ever, I don't consider G.I. Joe Sigma 6 a worthy heir to the classic series. Sure, it contains action from the start to the end, but the character of the figures was all but neglected...Afterall I don't think Sigma 6 has much in common with the originals since only the names and the history... so it could well be name in a completly different way and is just an other Anime among others!"
1,Still waiting,I'm still waiting for my product! No news about where it is nor it's actual delivery condition.I'll be glad to review more positively when (if it comes) I get it!!!
5,An Excellent Sally Forth Book,This was an excellent collection! Only complaint is that it's not (and never is) long enough.
5,Where is a new Sally Forth Collection,My version of I Gave at the Office is worn and torn from the use it's had from me and my fellow office folks. We are eagerly looking forward to another collection as good as this one.
5,A much needed title,As a newcomer to Scottish Border history I found the many forces and families influencing events very confusing. George MacDonald Fraser has written a remarkable book in which he creates order and logic from a very complicated period and at the same time has written a book which is etremely readble.It essential reading for anybody interested in border history and will no doubt be quoted extensively by writers who follow.
4,Excellent,"I sought out this book because of genealogical interest in the area (an immigrant ancestor having been born around 1600 in the Carlisle, England area. Although I cannot document an exact locale, I thought this book would give me a feel for the life being lived in this area at that time. I was not disappointed. The book is informative, at times humorous, well-documented, and well-written overall. At times, and especially toward the final 1/4 of the book, it begins to feel repetitive: there's only so many raids, counter-raids, and scalawags that can hold one's interest--too hard to keep them all straight. But that's only a slight complaint. The book more than met my expectations. A good read all-around!"
3,Pure factual? history of my ancestry - probably!,"Not much good in Kindle without the illustrations and photographs, so no real critique possible. Hardcover, Paperback edition essential. Otherwise, drier and duller than I expected (hoped). No great detail of women stolen and cattle raped (no, I didn't get that wrong). My forebears seem to have been really rather cowardly and stupid, not even marginally exciting and/or noble. Life then was indeed rather 'nasty, brutish and short'. It does explain a lot 'though about the current state of English/Scottish relationships - for anyone out there who thinks the Scots are simply English with funny accents, a look at this will help to disabuse you!"
3,Poor Book Design,"It is too bad that the poor design of this book makes it difficult to read. The content is interesting and well-researched, but what with the small type and the problem of the text and maps (!)disappearing into the too-narrow gutter, reading it is a chore. When will publishers learn that while reducing the size of the type and the book itself might save them money, they risk losing readers (customers)?"
3,Ok book,"I suppose the book itself is alright. I didn't see it mentioned here (or I missed it) but this book has flaps. My destructive kids can't read this book because of the flaps. In a few months (hopefully they outgrow this phase), we'll be able to introduce it into circulation. Until then, I wish I'd picked a different book."
3,"Cute, but nothing special","This book rhymes. I like that, and I understand it helps with phonics and verbal development. Unfortunately, the book really goes no where. My daughter is 17 months--she likes it ok, but is pretty bored with it already. She loves to open the flaps though. My next child will probably like it when he is young. I purchased this because I plan to start phonics with my daughter in the next year."
2,disappointed,"I bought this book for my then 15 months old son based on the high percentage of good reviews. But when I received the book I was so disappointed. The pages are thin, the story line is boring (both to my baby and I), and the flaps are too thin and too wide to grab my baby's attention. He looks at it once and almost never picks it up again."
4,"""The Journey to Oneness""","If you are looking for spiritual guidance spend some time with three ""ordinary"" women in this trio of books. Travel with them through the birth of two children and death of one, and see how little ""Grace"" opened them to love, revelation, inner-guidance, and peace. Whereas a life-changing event can be (and in this case, is) a powerful teacher, read about how they share, connect and ""figure out"" how to make what they learn all work on a day-to -day basis. For after all...don't we all have issues that we must deal with daily, and ...some sense of emptiness, questions about why, who are we, etc.? This is powerful, yet simple, compelling, yet understated. I would give it 5 stars, but it is a bit too wordy for my taste...don't let that stop you, in fact, it might not even bother you! I highly recommend it and am ordering several for gifts. (I want to keep my copy--I've highlighted many areas and wish to read it over and over!)"
4,Both guys worked hard.,I enjoy Walter Isaacson’s style as a biographer. He appears to do thorough research and presents his subject in a fair and unbiased light. Not only did I gain a higher appreciation of Mr. Franklin but also a higher appreciation of the work Mr. Isaacson puts into his writing.
5,Excellent!,"After reading Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography twice I was ready to learn more on one of our truly remarkable founding fathers. Comprehensive, easy to read and well researched, Isaacson's book compliments the autobiography very well. The research alone is broad and in-depth, based on the writings of Franklin and those (family and colleagues) who corresponded with him. The book continues, in the conclusion, to contrast the contradictions of the autobiographical/Poor Richard persona publicly displayed to the real actions Ben Franklin took in his life. It is a top book on one on the greatest personalities in the history of America."
3,Mix up between believale and not,"This book, set in the Depression of 1931, is a tale of a mysterious man who has the ability the show people the Self and the Authentic Swing. Young Hardy Jones is shown this power as Bagger Vance unleashes his powers for Hardy and Runnulph Junah. This story is a great story when it is in the present an focasing on the characters. But, when the story goes into the supernatural, it turns into an unrelatable mix up. I do not suggerst this book for the younger readers for they will become lost in this odd tale."
5,Golf and the meaning of life -- grippingly told,"A great golf story on it's own, but it's true impact results from the lessons of Bagger Vance, one of humankind's gifts from God. You must 'play' (similar to the Bible story of using your talents). You can't ""opt out"" of life."
3,Golfers will love it,"This is Pressfield's first book and it is a very readable tale of a great, mythical golf match in Savannah in 1931. If you like Golf you will find this an intriguing book with a few mystical pages that may be confusing or seem pointless but a lot of vivid almost lyric description of the people, the game and the era. It is a fun read but maybe especially so for golfers. It is totally different from his Greek novels and that may be a tribute to the range of his writing skill."
3,Good golf story muddled by poor attempt at mysticism,"This book reminds me of my own golf swing: it starts out promising, straight and true. But as it progresses, it takes a wicked slice and ends up somewhere in the woods, leaving disappointment in its wake. It is the story of an evening's encounter between a wise and experienced doctor/golfer and his young protege. The protege is considering abandoning both his medical career and his attempt to improve his very impressive golf game. The older man, hoping to intervene, begins with a story about a remarkable golf match long ago ... . The tale of the golf match is riveting and fascinating. I won't spoil it for you. But at the end of the match, the writer takes his reader on a detour of mystical proportions, applying golf to life in an impossible way that stretches credulity. This part of the story brings forth the mental image of a punctured balata: under pressure, it doesn't hold up."
1,bagger should be bagged and dumped,What a mistake it was to buy this book. It stank on ice. Instead of being serious and meaningful it was just plain silly and shallow. Do yourself a favor and read the Indian (sub-continent) source material that the author ripped off. I'm not sure I buy into this mystical connection between sports and spiritualism. Buy a good biography instead.
4,A superior lesson but little golf,"Don't get me wrong, I think this book was a great read for all those struggling golfers out there. However, after seeing the movie preview I assumed this book would contain more golf and less of a life lesson. The scenario is a small town gets to add their own champion into a tournament of three, including Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones. As the tournaments passes the mysterious Bagger Vance starts a long lesson in philosophy that at some points is well written and at others overdone. The lessons that Vance teaches seems to be the base of Buddism with various other unrelated view points. The story line of the golf tournament is a thrilling story but then is concluded by a predictable ending after the tournament. Overall I would reccomend this book for those interested in a philosophy or those extremely into the game of golf."
4,Golf is more than a game!,"I agree with the reviewer who reccomends reading this book even if you've seen the movie. This is one of those rare cases where the movie and the book are both very different products but are strengthened by their differences.This book is a must for anyone who plays golf with any amount of passion, especially if you saw and enjoyed the movie, because the two are so different. If you're not a golfer, after reading this book you may find yourself with a newfound appreciation for the game. Personally, after reading this book I can't wait for a chance to go to the driving range, and this would not be true if I had only watched the movie. Thankyou Steven Pressfield for writing this book."
5,Amazing book!!! A must read for anyone who loves the game.,"This book is the best golf book I have ever read. I read this book from cover to cover on a rainy day when I was working as a caddy at a local golf course. The next time I played I shot a personal best. Don't get me wrong, this is not an instructional book. It is simply a wonderful story."
2,I had to force myself to finish this book.,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. While the portion of the book that documents the competition is somewhat interesting, I felt I was reading a recruiting book for the occult."
2,A complete lack of subtlety,"Although my book group had a great discussion about the themes in the book, I can not say I enjoyed reading it in the slightest. First, the golf scenes are long and extremely detailed. You need to have some basic understanding and appreciation for golf in able to digest much of the story. Second, I found the author's use of metaphors extremely heavy handed. The author not only alludes to certain things - he reiterates explicitly that he was in fact referring to those things (I won't say what and ruin the story). At least it was a quick read."
2,Pretentious and Boring,"I bought this book with great anticipation, based on customer reviews and the fact that a major film was being made of it. While part of the novel was entertaining (bringing Hagen and Jones to life in a fictionalized way) the main premise was absurd and not entertaining. This book tries to portray golf as a metaphysical/religious activity instead of the wonderful game that it is. I revere ""Golf in the Kingdom"", with which this novel has been compared, as a classic study of why golf is an intellectually stimulating game. I threw ""Legend of Bagger Vance"" away when I finished it. It's not even worth passing on to a friend."
1,Not what was promised - and no reply to complaint,"The book.... is a great read! Love it.... the company that sent it to me after I purchased it, sent me a book with unevenly cut pages. Did not respond to me email about replacing the item, and I will never buy from them again. Period!"
4,"GEROGE CHAPMAN = THE RIPPER !!! WELL, MAYBE...","TAking a further step following the lead revealed by author Philip Sudgen in THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF JACK THE RIPPER, Gordon works his case upon George Chapman, the poisoner of wives, being Jack the Ripper. Of course he can't say definitely the Chapman was the Ripper, because his name neveer entered the Whitechapel's investigators reports before 1903, when Chapman was executed. Anyway, a very good book."
4,"Terrific characterization, mind-bending style","Fat Skeletons isn't a very big book, so it's appropriate that you seem interested withing five pages or so. And there's a good reason - the style is witty and transfixing. You won't find a capital letter, the word ""and"" written out, or many completed sentences. What reads is something like a confessional poem constricted into paragraphs, creating real intimacy around Mara. Which we barely need considering the vivid specificity of her life. Witness the scene in which she outtalks a sleazebag on a train in six languages - it shows Mara's prickly independent streak while reading like a mournful memoir. Still, it's hard to deny the book loses steam as it goes along. Luckily, its first half is so enticing, you barely notice - there's enough steam left over."
4,Childhood love of horses,This book was one of my favorite as a child and crazy about horses. It is still a good read but much sadder than I remember. The book I received is older and fits right into my bookcase with all my other childhood favorites. It is a book I read again and again and always brings tears to my eyes. (In a good way)
1,Pirated copy?,"While the information in this video is pretty good, it's a pirated copy or at least the quality is terrible. The tone is so monotone that it's difficult to keep listening."
2,Did not do the job,"I purchased this to fill in the lettering on my tires. It did not work. It would lay a white line down initially, then when i tried to go over it the marker tip would more or less whipe that same line off. It might be a better product if you are trying to brighten up the white from the factory on your tires."
5,The best book on New York,If you are going to be in New York City this is a great book to have. It is thorough and covers all of the areas you would want to see. The recommendations for hotels and restaurants are top notch. It includes an excellent subway map and has been useful on countless trips to the city.
2,Adult picture book,"I must say the pictures ARE great. I used this in conjuction with a Frommer's guide on my first trip to NYC this past fall and I hardly opened it once I was there. It gives nice histories and interesting information but next to nothing in the way of practical, useful information, especially for a first trip. If this wasn't listed as a ""travel guide"" I would have rated it higher, but that is not the case. It gives almost no recommendations on what to see, where to stay, where to eat, etc. Once you find yourself somewhere this guide is useful in reading about that particular spot. I think this is more fun to read if you're not actually going there just dreaming about going there. I plan to sell my copy and never use another Eyewitness Guide for a trip, though I might buy one for a place I'd like to ""see"" but never plan to travel to."
2,Not too interesting for the experienced,"The book has a very simple and clear way to describe what 3D design is about. It takes a simple project and teaches how to design it from scratch using basic design elements and explains how to develop it to a 3D animation film touching on cinematography and aesthetics(though very subtle and superficial).It is a great source for beginners and people who are not familiar with design and 3D terminology and elements. However even somewhat little experienced designers involved in 3D or graphic design would see that they already know most of the stuff told in the book. It is like ""3D & Design for Dummies""."
1,What a waste of money !,"This was a totally silent video. No Narrative and shot by a amatuer photographer doing work in Germany post World War 2. If this had been mention in the description of this DVD, I never would have bought it,"
5,Hitlers Reichschancellery,"Yes, this is a good color film about post war Germany if you want to get a good impression. However I think you must be interested in the downfall of the Third Reich. I was happy to see some new material about Hitlers Reichschancellery and bunker near the Wilhelmplatz.MarcelThe Netherlands"
1,Not what it appears,"I should've read further before buying this product. For one thing it's a near duplicate of the DVD title called, ""World War II: Germany Destroyed"" The video is old stock Army handheld camera footage without the benefit of any narration whatsoever. It's very boring and a total waste of money. What a rip-off!!"
4,Voigt tries something new,"Fans of Cynthia Voigt will still be engaged by this book, but it's something new. While her Tillerman stories were propelled by wonderful characters who faced real life dilemmas in ways that were true to life and themselves, and the Jackaroo series took those same skills and blended them with 'fantasy' elements, here Voigt's focus is less with the characters than with artistry of style and retelling an ancient myth believably in a modern setting. She certainly succeeds, and the reversal of the Orpheus and Eurydice male/female parts was a nice touch. That said, this book falls a little short of what Voigt can do with story lines she dreams up herself. I recommend A Solitary Blue or Dicey's Song (both in the Tillerman series)--if you liked this, you should like those as well."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I got to page 35 of this book before putting it down. The author's writing is jerky, abrupt, and the characters are unlovable. I have a hard time getting drawn into a story where the title character projectile vomits as part of her stage performance."
3,Entertaining 80s stuff,"If you're looking for matches that hit 4 stars, you should look elsewhere. On the other hand, there is a cool Rockers/Brainbusters match (with a screwy finish, just to warn you) and a Boss Man/Hogan match notable for a suplex off the top of the cage."
2,mediocre,"I kept checking the top of the page to verify that Barbara Delinsky was indeed listed as the author, because this story doesn't come close to the quality and outstanding style she is known for and fans like me have come to expect from her. Donovan's come-ons were far from subtle and the teasing went way beyond humorous - it was pushy almost to the extent of stalking or forcing himself on Liz. And the painful secret that has Liz scared to death of any sexual intimacy is so obvious to the reader, and it should have been to Donovan too. The first 100-125 pages were a struggle to get through. However, the story did improve by leaps and bounds once Liz revealed her secret to Donovan, and he became patient, tender and understanding. He changed his approach to expressing his love for Liz and getting her to accept that she is worthy/capable of being loved, and to admit that she loves him in return. The ending was redeeming and heartwarming."
2,Pure HQ Romance,"This was a very quick old fashion 1980's HQ book - so don't expect more than it can give you. This novel tells the story Elizabeth public relation expert who had terrible childhood and lack any self-esteem with men. Donovan is successful man who finds Elizabeth unlike anyone else he has ever met. They meet, they fight, and they fall in love."
3,Not Much To It,"This was the first book that I've read by Barbara Delinsky but I wasn't very impressed. If you're looking for a very quick beach read the book is alright, but there isn't much character development provided and the book drags on and on with the same sequence of events. The ""suprise"" at the end has been obvious throughout the novel. It is a simple quick read, but there's not much substance to it and when you're done you are left with close to nothing to consider."
5,"Comfy, but faded quickly","I didn't do anything above regular wear and the color faded on thses shoes. While they are comfy, they begin to look very old very fast"
4,KangaRoos Ruby,"I really like these shoes! I got a size 11, and I usually wear 10 or 10.5. (My feet are 10.5 inches long, btw.) I found the shoes to fit fine, but I prefer to wear a thicker athletic-type sock with them. I wear these shoes to exercise on my elliptical machine at home, going for walks, and just going about town for errands. They are comfy shoes, cushy, and do have some arch support- more than most other shoes on the market today (including Converse). I am thinking about getting another pair in a different style and color (the Lotus looks interesting...)"
5,Finding acapulco,"The sixties are back...Great music, great guitars, awesome...For any music lover, explorer or just for the melancoly of yesterdays is a must."
3,"It does what I need it to, mostly.","I actually got this through another site (refurbished) at a deep discount. The first one I had, had a defect and I had to send it back and get a replacement. The second one that I am using now, has worked fine for me for many months. The only problem that I have had is that it came with an extra A drive. I thought initially ""I will NEVER need this."" then yesterday I did. When I put it in, it made all sorts of groaning, grinding noises so I took it out. Then when I put it in again it refused to work. I tried everything, it just crapped out. So the A drive that I never thought I needed, and did need- now doesn't work. Other than that, I have no other complaints. It is a nice little unit at a nice little price. I don't use it for much more than surfing, blogging and doing my household budgeting- and this is the perfect computer for that. So while it doesn't ""wow"" me it doesn't disappoint either."
5,decoder = great,"this is first decoder I have purchased. It was 'plug and play' simple I removed the shell and plugged the decoder into the socket where I removed the 'blank' pins. I replaced the shell and gave it to my grandson who said ""it runs great""."
5,Atkins seems to have reviewed some of his extreme views,"Having read Dr. Atkins ""New Diet Revolution"" and ""Omega Diet"" I now feel as if Dr. Atkins is taking back, in a sense, some of his extreme views on things. Sure this is a book about a diet to defy age, but he's certainly showing himself considerably more open to eating fruits (the healthy ones of course) and the idea that not all fats are created equal (Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids concept, touched in extensive detail in the book ""Omega Diet""), which happened to be the two things that bothered me the most about the ""New Diet Revolution."" The book also gives a very detailed account about the role played by all antioxidants (natural and supplements) and vitanutrients needed to defy aging. I have made it my reference book when it comes to eating and living healthily."
3,It was good but not much new,"I felt Dr. Atkins book was good, but didn't find too much new information in it. If you have his first book, you'll be set."
5,Ticket to Health and Aging Gracefully & Slowly,"Dr. Atkins (and similar philosophy listed in ""Radiant Health - Beyond the Zone"" by another doctor) deserves a huge amount of credit for exposing the carbohydrate ""poisoning"" America has endured for the past 30 years. Atkins states his case clearly in a very readable book, I immediately bought vitamin E and gingko biloba after reading this. Be good to yourself and buy this book today!"
1,Not what it appears to be...,"The description on the back cover says ""An abridgement of Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution"", which would leave one to believe that it is a condensed version of the book.. but it is not! If you are looking for a taped version of the ""Low Carb Diet"" that is covered in the book.. forget it! My husband is not a reader, and I felt that he would benefit from understanding the diet that he is on by listening to the tapes. I wanted him not only to follow the diet, which DOES work, but also to understand WHY it works. This mainly talks about vitamins, hormones, heart problems, etc. Sorry, no stars from me! BUT the book is excellent, and the diet does work!"
4,"Stick With It, It's Worth The Read!",This book starts out highly technical and hard to understand but as it progresses everything seems to tie together and is very much worth the read. See you at age 100!
5,great for youth workers,"As someone who works with the youth at church, I find that the oddball things are the things that they find the most interesting. This book has many stories to keep the teens interested. Who knew unicorns were mentioned in the Bible? I have won bets since reading that!"
1,"The right title, but the wrong movie!","that was a bad surprise, when I wanted to watch the movie for the first time! I expected my favourite actor Errol Flynn, but the DVD played a film, which I haven't had ordered anyway! I don't know the actors, I suppose it must be a movie of the Thirthies with some ""no- name- actors""! I must warn every other customer of buying this movie! You will have a bad surprise. I am very disappionted, and I am not sure whether I should order another movie, which is released by Artiflix!House of Secrets"
2,Not same quality as other nine west boots,"After wearing this item twice, once to work and once to a dinner party they have many scratches and the ""leather"" is already fading by my toes. I am unhappy with the quality, but love the style and fit."
2,"The digital (USB) output is inconsistent, distorts","I may have gotten a bad unit (Made in China, of course), but after trying it for a few days I decided to return it.The analog output works more or less as expected (the cartridge is definitely ""medium-quality)"", and, I suspectthe preamp (which cannot be bypassed) does the rest to make the output sound ""cheap.""The problem is with the digital output from the USB. It is inconsistent from recording to recording and oftenintroduces extraneous noise and distortion, particularly with the EZ Audio Converter, but also with Audacity, orCD Spin Doctor. I get much better results by playing the records on my old turntable (with a high-grade AudioTechnica cartridge) and using an old inxpensive Onkyo audio-processor to digitize the analog output from my amplifier. I understand that some of the units are not made in China, and have better performance, so good-luck!"
1,Useless so far...waste of time,"After reading all the good reviews I purchased one for my Mac. I hooked it up today and loaded the disc. Nothing I clicked on would load. I kept getting messages about things missing and as a result it couldn't load. So I played it through Roxio and about 3 times in every song it sounds like the record's under water. I tried adjusting the tone arm weight from very light to very heavy and everything in between. No help. Also the manual says to click on ez audio converter.installer.pkg but it isn't on the disc. I only have a file called install.exe that opens adobe image reader but then tells me that parts of files are missing so I can't open it. So I put audacity in my applications, as per the instructions, but I get a message that it also can not be opened. So...I guess I'll call the non 800 number tomorrow since they're already closed today.So far a total waste of time.I'll update this if I ever figure it out. I REALLY wanted this to work."
4,ion turntable,This has become one of my son's favorites as he is having fun converting all his parents' old lps. It does the job. Our only problem is the iTunes program to convert back to CDs. We haven't figure that out yet.
4,Works well.,"Just fine! Came when it should have---does what it says it would. Looks sharp, feels a little cheap though."
4,A GOOD PRODUCT........BUT IT CAN BE TIME INTENSIVE,"Ready to use rite out of the box...I have been recording all my 1500 plus albums to my computer and all is well so far..Play back in my car is just fine..But this thing is VERY time intensive...Having to hit the ""next"" key after EVERY SINGLE TRACK is a pain in the...........But I can now burn any track from any album I have to a CD...After recording one side of an album you must stop and incert Artist name, album name and tracks recorded before recording the other side...I wish it would just ""pause"" so you can have all your music put together from that one album...I have found that the sound quality is good on play back...So I have not needed to download any of the advance recording options. I dont see why its really needed.. After all, I kind of like some of the snap, crackle, pop of those old albums...It just wounld'nt be right to listen to ""The Osmonds Live"" any other way...LOL!!Over all, Im lovin it..."
2,look beyond this one...,"This product is not worth the money. The turntable itself is made of plastic, and it is impossible to have record lay flat on it. The outer edges are always lower than the center. The cartridge and needle are poor.Invest $20-40 more and get a higher quality unit that you will be satisfied with over a longer period of time."
4,WORKED GREAT FOR THE MONEY,"i BOUGHT THIS FOR A PERSON THAT IS NOT THAT USED TO USING COMPUTERS. HE HAS HAD NO PROBLEMS WORKINJG AND RECORDING HIS ALBUMS INTO CD'S. YES, YOU HAVE TO USE AND LOAD ITUNES, BUT NO BIG DEAL."
5,ION iTTUSB05 USB Turntable,"The ION iTTUSB05 USB Turntable is very easy to use. It came with a dust cover, cueing arm, and easy to use software. It was up and running in 10 minutes. We were spinning vynl that had not been spun for 25 to 30 years. We had a great time. Using iTunes burning to a CD was simple and straight forward. There is other software for more advanced users, Audacity, which we have not used yet. Well worth the investment or gift giving."
4,Pleasant to use,"This has been a handy little gadget. It has gotten my vinyl albums out of the garage and onto CDs so I can finally listen to them again. Setup was simple and quick. I didn't use the recording software that came with it so I can't comment on that. All in all, it's very useful to me."
2,usb turntable amature,"This product comes with software that is very difficult to use. Unless you have other a/v capturing software already, you will probably find this difficult to use."
4,Works great!,"Does the trick for me - it plays my vinyls. The arm seems to be weighted right since they don't skip too much. I have to admit that the sound is a little thin. Maybe the stylus can be improved, but that would likely cost more than the turntable!All in all, I'm very happy with it."
2,hi tech nightmare,"I cannot get the albums to separate into tracks and name for saving. I cannot get them to save to any program on my computer, so cannot burn to cd. Which is the whole reason I bought the turntable.I have not given up, but the intructtions seem to be missing so information and you have to call tech support and download other programs. I just haven't had the time. Why does it have to be so hard?I am longing to save the old lps to cd and mp3.Frustrated!"
1,"Didn't work, sent it to the manufacturer.","The belt on the turntable had to be installed, but it still did not work. The motor was not operational. The manufacturer offered to have it picked up. They have but I have yet to receive it back. Hopefully it will work then........."
2,not what i expected,"this was not why i expected. i thought it would be an easy gadget, but it was not. it doesn't even have an on/off button. the turntable never worked. the instructions suggest what u need to do should the turntable not spin. I didn't even try it, just a waste of time. amazon's return policy makes it so easy to return the item back that i have no regrets on getting it as long as it was from Amazon."
4,ION Turntable works fine,"I bought one of these to get music off of rare old records, some dating back to the 1930s. So far I have tried 45s and 33 rpms. It works just fine using the Audacity software. To do 78s, you have to change it using the software once you have recorded. I plan to try that next.At first I had problems because I could not figure out how to start the turntable going round. There is no on button for this turntable. It starts when the tone arm is moved over the record. However, mine would not start turning even then. I had to remove the platter and put the belt into place. I was completely off. Perhaps that happened in shipment or maybe it was never put on during manufacture. Anyway, once the belt was in place, the machine worked perfectly fine. It isn't a robust piece of equipment. But I believe it will do the work that I need just fine, which is taking the music off of old records."
1,Mac Users Beware,"This thing is marketed as Mac-compatible. The product description, the labeling on the install CD and the product manual all refer to an ""EZ Audio Converter"" software for the Mac version. Too bad nothing with that name is actually contained on the software CD! The only thing that installed for me was the advanced ""Audacity"" software (a fitting name), which has left supporting files spread all over my Applications folder, but which includes nothing that actually launches the program when clicked. Is it possible that the CD is faulty, or that if I called the company looking for tech support they'd help me get it up and running? Doubt it, as there doesn't appear to be a 1-800 number included on any of the documentation. If fast, easy set-up is a factor in your decision to purchase this item, DON'T!"
4,ION Turntable,"The ease of hooking up and using this turntable is easy. Once you set up your computers sound card and install the software that comes with your turntable you are good to go. The sound quality is excellent. But if your Vinyl Records are in poor shape, you are gonna have to edit the popping and hissing out. But if you all were like me and took care of your old Vinyls then you won't have that problem. But I do highly recommend this turntable for anyone who wants to rescue their LP's from the Closet of doom."
2,"Okay for 12 inch,","It's O.K. for 12 inch (33) vinyl, But today I tried playing from a 7 inch (45) record and it would skip on the very last 8 seconds. It appears to be something wrong with it's automatic needle/arm return. Beware, I have never had any luck with automatics, only buy semi as they tend to be higher quality."
4,"Works good, does the job well","I have owned this product for about two years and use it once or twice a month to convert old records into mp3 music files. I especially like the dust cover as it keeps the unit clean between it's infrequent use. I use Audacity to record and clean up the music. When I'm done I can't hear any hiss and very little of clicks and pops common to records. It is a great way to preserve old music and clean up the noise generated from dirty records.The only drawback is the physical size, I think it could have been designed on a smaller footprint. It takes up a lot of shelf space. I would rate it 5 stars if it were a bit more compact."
2,Needed repair,"I gave this turntable as a gift and can't give it a thorough review. However, I thought I should tell people about our initial problems.When we first set the unit up, the turntable was loose on it's platform and non-functional. It took an hour of tinkering and finally removing its particle-board base to find that a nut/washer had come loose. Once I found this is was easy to repair and the unit now works as intended.Construction seems pretty delicate and I wonder how long this thing will last. But perhaps you get what you pay for. The audio seems adequate but I'm not a sophisticated judge of these things. I already knew it doesn't do 78 but if anyone is unclear on that... it doesn't do 78.I actually kind of like the tone-arm controls. It operates in a very precise and gentle manner."
2,SADLY DISAPPOINTED,"If you own the Disney Family Fun Crafts book and the Family Fun Parties book, you have seen most of the ideas in this book. I was really excited to get this book but there werent many new ideas. :("
5,Very Pleased,"This book is an awesome resource for make-at-home costumes and decorations. The ideas are so cute, easy to follow, and where else can you find a recipe for slime?"
5,Mellencamp dvd,This DVD gives you a taste of his live concerts in good recordings. Wish they where full concerts as there is little available on DVD
5,"JM DVD..great, by why so brief?","A great opportunity lost here, five songs last about 25 minutes. Where's Paper & Fire' etc...too short but brilliant in spite of..."
1,Flawed product,"I received a DVD which appeared to be new in its original seal wrap. Upon trying to view it, I discovered that it was blank except for an intro line of Freedom Road. I contacted the seller, who graciously accepted the return of the DVD and credit to my account. Too bad it didn't work out."
5,nice,"i bought this coz i have a dr. grip pen that was first given to me by a coworker. i love the pen so much that i didn't want to just dispose it and buy a new one. thankfully, i found this ink refill here in amazon. i will buy again again for sure :)"
1,"The Terrorists are among us, .","""The Terrorists are among us"" he is right and Steve Emerson is one of them because he is lying to create terror from peaceful American Muslims. Many people already know that Israel and the US government are doing most of the terror and the killing around the world (hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians). Sept 11 was not the work of 19 Muslim guys, since several of them are still alive and this has been confirmed. Do your research and you should find the truth, the overwhelming evidence is on the internet. Don't depend on the US News media and the bigots, or so called experts like Steve Emerson for all your information, or you'll be in the dark and you would misinformed."
4,"Great record, great band, deserve better exposure","Ambitious follow-up to 2002's excellent ""Rumbo Submarino"", which covers more o fhte same ground and is not quite as tightly packed with great songs, but even in its weaker moments still delivers intellligent, high quality international pop.I don't know why this group hasn't gotten better exposure. Dani Carbonell is a founding member of Ojos de Brujo and very prominent on their most recent album which is receiving alot of (well-deserved) accolades. You'd think some distributor would pick this group up as well."
3,"Nice looking, good price","I bought this watch as a cheap, reliable timekeeper for somewhat rough international travel. It is a great watch and looks good, particularly for the money, except for one really important thing: It's an alarm watch, and the alarm is so quiet and high-pitched that it's very difficult to hear unless you're in a very quiet room. It's certainly not loud enough to wake any but the lightest sleepers. Thus one of its main functions isn't all that useful. Otherwise, it looks cool, is totally accurate, and the price was right."
3,Not an Alarm watch,"I like the style of this watch. It looks great and fits nice too. The alarm as many others noted is very quiet. I don't rely on it at all. I use my cell phone alarm now instead of the watch.If your looking for a watch to wake you up this is not it. But as good fit, feel and looks go, this watch has all of that going for it."
3,Pulsar Men's PF3293 Alarm Chronograph Watch,"Excellent service from Amazon. Received watch within 7 days. Very nice watch, good price the only negative thing I can say is the strap and casing are of a very poor quality."
3,Decent watch but wouldnt say worth the money,"i received this watch as a gift last year and it looks really nice but the band is something that you have to get used to since it is really uncomfortable. The alarm is really quiet but is something i never use, The one great thing about the watch is the fact that it runs off of motion instead of battery. I still get compliments on it everyday but i wouldn't say its worth the money"
1,Corner Computer Curio,"This product is not the quality product advertised. Finish is scratched and not easy to assemble. When completely assembled, doors are not even. I could have purchased an item of equal quality, already assembled locally at probably less cost. Would not recommend this product to other consumers."
1,Not the Australian Paul Kelly!,Bought this by mistake thinking it was by the Australian singer/songwriter Paul Kelly. D'oh! Don't make the same mistake as me!
5,Darling quilt set,"The quilt was even cuter than described. It is simple and so feminine. I bought it for my little girl who just got her first ""big girl bed"" and she absolutely loves the flowers and just how ""pretty"" it is."
4,Witty wisdom walking San Francisco,"I haven't read very many books about American women in middle management where the heroine actually thinks about her work, thinks about its consequences, thinks about how her work encourages or discourages her own personal growth. Pearl City Control Theory does all that--in an engaging and humorous way. While far from ignoring outside work issues like friendship, sex, and the pleasures of a wonderful walking city like San Francisco. Karen Allen has written a story of a woman waking up to her life, and waking up, and waking up--with help and distractions from a host of three dimensional, fascinating characters. It's a moving book, a funny one, and even an inspiring one. For those looking for popular fiction on the intelligent, distinctive level of an Alice Hoffman--with perhaps more pertinence to the average working woman's life--Pearl City Control Theory's a winner."
2,A disappointment,"This novel has much going for it, most notably good writing and a likable protagonist, Sara. Unfortunately, Sara is surrounded by far less likable characters. It's not clear what she ever saw in Mark, the husband she declines to follow to Washington and soon cuts loose. Aaron, her new love interest, comes across as manipulative and creepy. Sara's sister is so tough and sour that we're relieved when she leaves for Africa with the man she loves -- not because we're happy for her, but simply because we're glad to be rid of her. Sara's superiors at work are little more than caricatures of soulless businessmen. Reading _Pearl City Control Theory_ is like going to a party thrown by someone you really like . . . and then getting stuck all evening talking to one unpleasant guest after another."
5,The Tate Revenge,"Excellent story line. Easy reading. Very creative mystery. Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, clean mystery. A perfect example of a great story without excessive sex and violence or foul language."
3,Somebody needs to proofread,"An adventure novel that just doesn't quite make it -- too little adventure throughout and too much in the last chapter. It would be an OK story but I had to work too hard to get past the numerous, careless typograpical and editing errors."
5,Ive seen whats been goin on..and thought i was goin bonkers,"for awhile now..ife sat back, observed many things, people, the animals, weather..politics, etc...and geez, when i expressed my thoughts, etc..people have literally told me im imagining things..etc..bein negative...and all that.. BUT, by chance i spotted this book, and a few others ,,, read them..and SEE..as well as KNOW.. im not losing my marbels...just seeing/watching, etc..things...most people are to blind/ignorant, and or to self absorbed to take heed , listen..and to take things seriously for a change..instead of so lightly..that its made into a joke.. LOVED the book! scale from 1-10...I rate it a ""10"" sandra dorsey"
1,boring!,"I found this hard to read and quite tedious. Thought it would be full of interesting people, instead it's all about the scientific protocols which could be fascinating if he had included more about the psychics."
5,"Awesome writing, awesome art!","Gilbert Hernandez's ""Fear of Comics"" is a wonderful anthology of comic shorts that serves as an excellent showcase of his first-rate writing and dramatic sensibilities. Ranging in tone from zany to macabre to absurdist each of the dozen or so stories (along with another dozen or so comic-strips) are narrative treats unto themselves. From the paranoia of the sci-fi tale, ""Return of the Tzik,"" to the surreal horrorscapes of ""The Legend of the Crying Woman: La Llorona,"" this book will surely have a story or two of interest to anyone - fans of Hernandez or not.And, it certainly goes without saying that the stark black and white visuals in every panel actually lives up to the quality of writing working hand in hand to enhance the overall quality of the book every step of the way. A quality book not to be missed by any fans of the graphic novel medium."
5,Time Well Spent,"This book flows to the reader with the pleasure of a good novel; yet, it delivers more information than most textbooks. I am a television producer by trade and enjoy a good story well told. I was on a cruise ship this last weekend and looked upon the sea with new understanding and fascination. Information is better retained when logically delivered. This has become a favorite on my bookshelf and now I am purchasing it as gifts for friends. My thanks to the authors."
2,Riddled with mistakes,"Although this is an enjoyable read the book is absolutely riddled with unacceptable mistakes. Carbon dioxide once dissolved in the sea forms the carbonate ion which combines with calcium (not carbonate) to form calcium carbonate (p.12). P.67- the cape of good hope is at the tip of AFrica not South AMerica. And lastly (I have only read to page 80!) the positive charge of the water molecule is on the hydrogen not oxygen (negative on oxygen), and the hydrogens in water don't bind to one another-like charges repel each other , not attract. The hydrogens (+) bind to the oxygens (-) to adjacent molecules!!!!!!!!!! Ugh!!!!!!!!"
4,I've changed my mind,"I have already written a review. I think I may have been sort of mean. Now that I have read the entire book I feel like I should write a new review. I did enjoy the book. The mistakes I refered to in my previous review did not continue throughout the book. I read it to my son at night and he enjoyed it. Overall it was a pretty decent read. So, I've changed my mind."
5,Perfect compact keyboard,"I don't have room on my desk for additional clutter. This is a perfect keyboard for small spaces. Be aware that it is very similar to a typical laptop keyboard, so if one has difficulty using this size, then would not work for you. I have an average hand size, which should also be a consideration. Also like a laptop keyboard, it may not be comfortable if you will be doing hours of typing.Additionally, I love the sleek appearance and the crisp response. I have several keyboards for my collection of PCs...this one is my favorite."
4,beautiful book,"If your taste in architecture runs to chrome and glass, this book is not for you. These houses are in no way traditional, and look like the builders had no knowlege of actual building styles or techniques. These are all homes built by Artists for themselves, using found materials. They are not built by carpenters using standard materials. Some are gorgeous, but all look comfortable and homey. These homes look like they belong in a book of fairy tales, or some hollywood movie set. The photography is beautiful. My only complaint is that the book is too small - both in it's dimentions and length. Don't know how much trouble it would be to get them to pass the building codes, but I would be happy to live in any of them. If you have any appreciation for the arts, or a love for nature, you will enjoy this book."
5,Love Guild Wars,"Nothing else to say. I have been playing this for 7 years. Eye of the North, GW, Factions. Love them all. Now am plaing GW2 even more awesome."
4,Quick game,"Compared to the other Guildwars games, this one has the shortest campaign, and the story was kinda dull. But the assassins and ritualists are fun to play as, so it makes up for it."
3,Factions: Love it or Hate it.,"When I first popped in Factions I was expecting the beautiful, colorful Guildwars world I know and love. This game only brought some of that ""epic adventuring"". Co-op play is still the same, which is good, but I didn't really feel myself getting into the ""gloomier"" world of factions. A must have for Guild Wars fans, but not for those who play the game on the side."
2,Quite simply a weak link in the series,"I've read most of the other reviews, and there is pretty much a concensus that this is the weakest installment of the series. With an expansion announced for this winter and a whole new game, Guildwars 2, announced, the only reason to buy this one is if you find $40 on the street and can't hold on to it until Eye of the North comes out. Longtime players will want it simply to round out skills and for the sake of completeness, but there is no reason the guildwars universe can't be fully enjoyed without ever setting foot in Cantha."
5,Great Game,"This is my first GW game and I am not dissapointed at all. It's extremely fun, theres a ton of quests, and the game-play is great.Pro.s1.Great Gameplay2.Nice People (sure there are a couple of butts... but there is on every online game)3.Tons of quests4.At least for me, theres no lag.5.Great Graphics6.Level cap at 20 (that way there no super people, you can still increase you attributes though)7.Tons of outfits, weapons, ways to change the appearance of yourself (dyes for your clothes and such), tons of people.8.If your a ranger you can have a pet.Cons1.Level cap at 20 (it would be nice if you could show off a really high level guy... but...that would also be kind of scary for newbs.Thats all. And if you play the game, I am ""Pugmo Pugman"" and as of now I'm a lvl.14 Elementalist/Ranger and I have a pet tiger named Nermal."
1,Do NOT buy this game USED!!!!!,"I thought I could save some money buy buying a used game but the access key that must be used to play the game has already been used and is non transferable so I basically got the physical game but I cannot play it because of the used access code. I got my game from Wowhead and I don't understand why they even sell the game used if it's not playable and non transferable. Isn't that illegal to sell it?Just a warning.I'm sure the game itself is great but now I have to keep the game and repurchase another key from online (a whole new game) because my returning this would cost me more than what I paid for the game itself. So, I'll just keep the physical copy of it and reorder a new copy from online. But it did NOT save me money.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME USED FROM ANYONE!!!!!!"
3,Beautiful game with unbalanced power,"The game is beautiful, the graphics, the characters....everything. But the power is absolutely unbalanced. They tried to provide us with more challenge but it's not challenging, it's frustrating trying to beat one quest for an entire day. The are fewer quests but even though they give more exp a character can't level enough to be able to fight the mobs. They are 3-5 levels higher. It is fun but it is more frustrating."
1,Pffft - No Thanks!,"I gave this a one because the graphics are good, but the game itself fell extremely short of my expectations. If you want action without complication, try Runescape ... the game leaves my character stranded and me confused. Sorry to all the GWF lovers but this game blows."
2,Ritualists ruined pvp Random Arena,"The ritualist is one of the new professions that comes with factions. It is the only profession that allows you to create multiple spirits that do damage, blind, interrupt, heal, evade melee, steal health, knock downs and other things. Its an army all it self. So instead of 4v4 in random arena you and up with 4v5 or even 4v6."
4,One of the most interesting technical finance books availabl,"This book is very thought provoking and in my opinion is right-on. Interesting reading for an often dry subject. If only most accounting courses could be this interesting.However, with the amount of bookeeping that is illustrated and the advance of household computers over the past 15 years, I think many a reader would be better served to get an updated version that has some computer programs to supplement the reading material."
5,How to Live Within Your Means and Still Finance Your Dreams,"Good practical ideas about money, a little old school, but nothing wrong with that.A very good buy for a penny!"
3,Stephen King Collection,"The Stephen King Collection is pretty good. Although, it would have been better if they would have used something such as ""Sleepwalkers,"" instead of ""The Dead Zone."""
3,"Pet Sematary and Dead Zone are good, the others are lousy","Pet Sematary and Dead Zone are good, but the others are lousy. Really lousy. Silver Bullet is just stupid."
3,Once Upon A Predictable Book,"This book seemed to flow strangely. The family acted as though it was impossible to stop Queen Olympia in the beginning, but then, all of a sudden, the family fights back. I thought that was weird, and it was strange that Marigold's family risked everything they did for someone they did not know at all, Christian. I could predict all the endings for this book, and I could not stand the ending where huge things occurred in nigh on four pages. The ending was sloppy, predictable and too quick. It was too perfect of an ending, most true fairy tales don't end so perfectly. The one thing about this book that annoyed me the most was how Christian and Marigold, children themselves, fell in love so quickly and acted like spouses. If you want a story that is complex in nature, worth your time, or realistic, you should not read this book."
3,Hi,This was a great book. It was absolutely fantastic. Though it was not my favorite book. That title would be reserved for the Warriors book Into the Wild.
3,Quick little fantasy read,"This book was on my daughter's seventh grade required reading list, which sort of astounds me as it seems way below that reading level. It's a prince and princess fantasy novel that took me only a couple of hours to read. She was bored to tears by it, but this genre isn't really her thing."
4,This book was wonderful,"It was cute, romantic, extremely creative, funny... in a cheesy way of course, contained very likeable characters, and was vivid in detail.Where else can you find glowing crystal caves, castles with walls made of teeth, a forgetful tooth fairy, a silly troll who mixes up modern sayings, and a princess who picks her nose?This is definitely one of my all time favorite books, and although essentially it's for mid-to older teens and females, I truly believe everyone can and will enjoy at least one aspect of the book, if not the entire book."
2,Not worthy for reading,"my friend suggested i read this book, she said it was funny and sweet so i ordered it and began reading it. Take it from me, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK, IT'S NOT WORTH IT. i thought this book was going to be good but i soon found out it was BORING and CORNY. im sorry to say but i did not like this book. The ending was so impossible, everything happened so fast, the author didnt even let us imagine whats going to happen in the future. i truely disliked this book, even the romantic scenes were too much for me. i love romantic books but this was just so retarded. If you're between the ages of 9-11, perhaps u may like it but take it from me, this is NOT WORTHY FOR READING."
2,Predictable and mediocre...,"As someone who enjoys original fairy tales, I had some pretty high hopes for this book. It didn't meet them. Ed, a troll who lives in the woods comes across a young boy who has run away named Christian. Unable to find his family, Ed adopts him. Christian grows and soon tires of his non-existent social life. He yearns to go to the castle across the river, partly because of the excitement, partly because he has a crush on the young Princess Marigold, who he has been spying on with his telescope. Ed reluctantly agrees to let him go, and before he knows it, he befriends Marigold and finds out her secret. Several times I just wanted to flip to the last page and go ""I knew it!"" but I kept reading. I think the best part of the book was the beginning. If you don't like it then don't even bother reading the rest."
4,A mock fairy tale with some odd characters-,"I would definitely recommend this book for those readers out there who would like to read a frothily dreamy, sweetly silly fairy tale. It's a quick read and moves quite quickly after some introduction. Great for a quick summer read~"
5,Once Upon A Marigold,This was the best book i've ever read.It was extreamly exciting. I grade this book an A++! If your looking for a book and havent read Once Upon A Marigold this book is yours.If you read it and don't like it your crazy.Thats because when I read it I couldn't put it down!
4,A great read -- pick it up!,"I got this book at a book fair at school, and wasn't expecting much, as I'm well over the age limit of ""Intermediate"". I happen to be a sucker for fairy tales, which is why I picked it up. I was in for a treat -- this book is great! It's funny, witty, and has a great ending that leaves you spinning with great ideas. It's definitely a great book worth a read, and even more so if you like fairy tales and comedy intertwined. It nails a few comical society problems (without sounding drab one bit), and has the exact amount of tension to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last period. I'll be looking for a sequel to this book, because the end leaves you grinning for more! It's one of the rare books that I've found actually ends complete but leaves room for a sequel, which is one of the qualities that draws readers in. Great work, Ms. Ferris!"
5,"Sweet, fluffy princess story","A princess in a castle, trolls and fairies, and a beautiful crystal cave in the woods make a delightful setting for this story of a young man who has very little experience of the world, but who wants to set out from home to follow his dreams. Christian doesn't know who his parents are. He only knows the forest and Ed, the troll who adopted and raised him. But when he spies on a distant castle through his telescope, he suddenly wants to travel -- and meet the lonely princess he saw.A lovely fairy tale filled with warmth, comedy, and heart, for middle-grade girls who love princess stories. Ages 8-12."
4,What a sweet fairy tale!,I read this several years ago and loved it! I would consider it a children's book or young adult with the characteristics of Ella Enchanted. A very imaginative author!
5,Excellent Book!,Once Upon a Marigold was a terrific book! It is a fairy tale and there are some pretty funny things in this book. This book also has a little bit of romance in it. If you like funny and romance you should read this book! I know I loved it and right now im reading Twice Upon A Marigold. So check that out if you read this one and like it.
3,Once Upon a Marigold,It's about a boy named Christain who lives in a cave with a troll. Then he starts to spy on the royal family with his telescope and falls in love with princess Marigold. Then he starts sending birds with messages and they become pen pals.
1,A real review from a real reader,"I know that many of the ""reviews"" that appear here are propoganda put forth by the authors and the author's friends, but I'm a real parent who has spent the last 4 weeks reading this book to my 9-year-old at bedtime. It began promising enough but it became an annoyance quickly. The author flits from idea to idea and never really follows a cohesive story through. Also, readers beware -- the author has filled the book with a lot of words that most adults never come accross in a book. I found myself reaching for a dictionary quite a bit trying to define the ""oh-so-smart-and-look-how-clever-I-am"" vocabulary. To compare this to Princess Bride does that book a disservice. Bride is cleverly plotted, fresh, intelligent, witty and satirical. This strives desperately to be all of those things and falls flat. Give me my 30 nights back!!!"
4,Pretty good fairy tale,Fans of Patricia Wrede's Dragon series or Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine will probably enjoy this book. The books is in the tradition of movies like Knight's Tale: traditional-ish fairy tale with modern day overtones. Christian and Marigold communicate via p-mail (pigeon mail.)I think this is a book that intermediate and middle school readers will enjoy.
3,A Blooming Book,"I think that Once Upon a Marigold was ok. The beginning was fun and pretty good. The ending was terrible though. In the end everything just happened at once. I recommend this book to kids ages 9-10,but kids that are older than 10 shouldn't read it. I think the characters were developed really well. I enjoyed it just a little."
4,"A funny, silly, sometimes serious fairy tale about an idiomatically ignorant troll, a runaway boy, and the girl of his dreams","Marigold, a bookish, average girl, who also happens to be a princess, is the object of the affection of Christian, who, at the age of six, runs away from his family and ends up in the care of Edric, a dog-loving forest troll and unlikely father-figure, where he spends the next eleven years of his life. He falls in love with the princess after spying her through his telescope and exchanging anonymous p(igeon)-mail, eventually being hired to work at the castle, where he learns of Queen Olympia's plan to marry off Marigold and claim the throne for herself. An original story with a neat plot, which can be enjoyed by both boys and girls."
3,Cute,"This was a pretty cute story. I tripped up on some of the dialog, especially at the beginning, because it didn't always feel realistic (which seems like a funny thing to say about a fantasy, I know). I also got a little confused at the beginning about who was supposed to be the main character because we saw into the thoughts of both the fatherly troll and the lost kid.But I thoroughly enjoyed the love story and how the author brought together various elements at the end to wrap it all up. All in all, I enjoyed it."
2,Whistling Thule 421,"If you have a 05+ Tacoma you should look for a different rack , TracRac is good choice. This rack will NOT go to the full lowered position with the shape of the Tacomas bed. Also if your using this for contractor needs and you add the ""Load Stops"" this rack will whistle like crazy! SO ANNOYING!! People will here you coming from miles away. Thule really dropped the ball on the R/D on this one."
4,Thule Xsporter 421/422,This is a great rack and I am very pleased with it! My only disappointment was it only had two adjustable positions where as other models have five positions. I cut additional slots in the uprights to allow three postions. One thing I did not consider when purchasing this rack is I have a tool box on the back of my truck which forces me to place the rack over the top of my wheel well and does not allow me to lower the rack as much as I would like. It's still a great rack and I recommend it highly! I have no trouble with whistling as some other reviewers wrote. The rack looks good on the truck also!
4,OTC Prybars,"I am a senior tech at an Agricultural dealership. I am replacing my Snap-on prybars with these. These are an excellent quality tool. I will get many years of use out of them, they are well made and with quality steel. Don't hesitate to buy OTC's tools, always a good choice."
3,cheap meterial,"Its a good set for the price, but they use cheap metal that easily bends compared to my snap on pry bars"
5,One of my top-5 favorite Christmas CDs!,I gave this CD as presents for several friends and family - one kept playing it into April because she loved the music so much. Different and gorgeous arrangements of well-known melodies and also more obscure ones are done to perfection. Don't pass this one up!
5,Fantastic,I'll make this a short review. These two symphonies are so exciting to listen to and the performance is flawless.
5,Amazing Playing from a Great Player,"I'm a music teacher and I use this CD to inspire both myself and my students. Mesut taught me guitar a few years ago at UCSC, and I was always amazed at his intensity and attention to detail. His technique on the guitar is impeccable, and his focus and single-mindedness show as he rips off dazzling runs without a single hitch. I remember not really believing my eyes or my ears watching him play. What is amazing really is that something so rooted in discipline could become so moving to listen to. His version of ""La Misionera"" is hot! I play it for my high school students to get their attention toward playing classical music. What happens? Their jaws drop to the floor, and they want to know more. Me? Whenever I'm feeling tired or complacent, I can listen to Mesut and be inspired to press on. I think this disc does him justice."
2,Missing a lot,"I am using this book to bring myself up to speed on a project that combines Velocity with Struts. I'm working with Struts and Velocity modules built by a consulting company. Before the project, I didn't know either one. Now I am in the middle of the project and somewhat familiar with both. Most of the velocity commands I am able to figure out pretty quickly without the book, which is good because every time I try to find something ($link.setAction for example, which is needed to obtain the URL for forwarding) it's not there. Maybe I'm missing something, but if I am, it also is not identified in this book. I'm doing much better by referring to my Struts reference(Programming Jakarta Struts) and searching the web."
3,Made me hungry,"Good story, but I gained 10 pounds from reading it. Main character was always talking about food. Good reading."
4,It is what it is,"Apparently this is music created for Japanese rope bondage shows (the correct title is Music for Bondage Performance), a cultural phenomenon that hasn't quite caught on in America.I think one reason why this works, despite being nihilistic atonal noise, is that the sounds are generally very clear and distinct, and don't degenerate into aural sludge. I wouldn't exactly call it catchy, but it is intriguing, often beautiful and driven by a deliberate aesthetic sensibility. Occasionally even a hint of a melody will appear from deep within the harsh, droning machinery."
2,"Looks great, doesn't last","The plastic portion (below where you tie the hook) broke off on mine after the third cast. It looks great in the water, I wish I had it long enough to catch something though..."
5,The best bait!,This lure catches bass everytime I throw it in the water!! What a great bait! I HIGHLY recommend~~
5,Great British Mystery,"I watched this on PBS and just had to have a copy for myself. P,D. James is a fantastic writer and the acting is simply great."
2,Only one Adam Dalgliesh,"If you seen all of the P.D. James series, there's only one Adam Dalgliesh and that's Roy Marsden. I couldn't get used to Martin Shaw in the role. In addition it was a pretty complex story, but then all of PD James' stories are pretty complex with the guilty party barely noticed. I got to the point, where I could usually figure out the guilty party from the very first few scenes. It was always the one you least suspected, and s/he generally came on at the beginning of the story.I generally enjoy all of the TV James mysteries except the fast spoken language is very hard for an American to catch on to, especially those with a dialect. Cockney, etc. Unfortunately there is no option for sub-titles. That sort of thing doesn't bother a lot of people, but it does bother me."
2,Buyer Beware,"Unlike some other records in this series, the Artie Shaw collection is made up mostly of the original recordingsrereleased on V discs, NOT tracks recorded specifically by Shaw for release on V disc. So unless you don't have Beginthe Beguine, or Stardust or Frenesi as originally recorded, or you have a burning desire to hear them in poor transfers,this album isn't for you. Yes, the version of Summertime is an alternate not found on the Mosaic box set, butvirtually everything else is available elsewhere, with better sound. They even tack on an introduction to The Maidwith the Flaccid Air to make you think you're about to hear some rare aircheck; it isn't.And finally, there is NO discography provided whatsoever-- for obvious reasons Collectors Choice Musicdoesn't want you to know ahead of time that this V disc presentation on CD is just so much smoke & mirrors."
3,fair,"The box was slightly damaged and the sword slightly bent. But it was for my son and he enjoys owning it. So, overall a decent purchase."
4,Surprisingly fun,"Picking this up was done on a whim. I like anime and I've watched/own the anime Sukeban Deka, which was based on the same manga as this movie.However, I have to say that the movie manages to put a lot more heart into the story. Part of that is the artress playing the main character who wears the role of tough streetwise girl well. She looks a bit out of place at times, but that is part of the story and the writers manage to use that to help build the drama and tension.This movie isn't for everyone. By most Japanese standards its almost non-violent. The few deaths are remarkably unbloody and there is little violence in the first half of the movie. Instead the tale builds slowly towards the fights at the end. The fights themselves do have a unreal feel about them, but are still fun to watch.Good fun, and a surprisingly clean action film. Better than many I've seen Hollywood pump out in the past 5 years."
3,yo-yo girl cop,it was very interesting with yo-yo. a demonstration of unique and very strong yo-yo string. but it needed something than a school girl outfit. more of a super hero type of outfit. but it's just okay.
2,I fell asleep for 20 minutes...,"I don't know what I was hoping for when I started this movie, but all I got was disappointment.Horrible acting coupled with treacherous dubbing really did it for me. I tried to save my self with the sub-titles but they were far more heinous than I could have hoped for.I did however like the explosions in the movie. Although very unrealistic it earned them a star.I fell asleep in the middle of the movie for about 20 minutes and when I woke up I knew exactly what was going on. I went back to see what I might have missed and it turns out I was better off just sleeping."
2,Wasting Time,"Punching, kicking, fighting and blowing each other, schoolgirls show no logical sense for their actions at all.It is better watchingAzumionce again."
5,Rika & Aya ROCK!,"I've seen the Japanese version of this with subtitles and it was an AWESOME movie. It's got tons of action, some very humorous moments (such as when Aya nails herself in the head with her own Yo-Yo), and a great story. Not to mention it's got the girls of our favorite J-Pop dynasty, Hello! Project. Aya Matsuura does great as Saki Asamiya and Rika Ishikawa is absolutely gorgeous as the main villainess. I just love that the creators took these very beautiful girls and inserted them into such a wonderful movie. I will have this DVD for sure! The only thing will be that it will be weird hearing other actresses doing the dubbed voices, but hey, it's still something to add to my collection:)"
5,If you make wine this is a must have!!!,Great tips for tweaking your homemade wine. I read each issue cover to cover and learn something with every issue.
3,its o.k....nothing super...,"First of all the point breaks off to easily, second...it looks kind of tacky....my recomendation...mix with a little water when applying it works better"
4,Get this one before it's gone forever,"Joe is steel-guitar fool, and he knows every lick in the book. Sure, ya gotta love the pedal steel to listen to this stuff, but assuming that's true, this one's a treat."
4,Grinning 'n picking,"This record will have you smiling and tapping along to every track. I almost never can stomach Beatle covers, but this album works. It's a great record from begining to end, something that is great for those long Sunday drives. The obvious love of both the music of the Beatles and country hot picking make for strange but very pleasing bed fellows. Give it a listen, I guaratee you'll be grinnin' while Joe Goldmark is pickin'."
2,In my opinion -not the best,"was suppossed to be a gel, but, the product was very runny and made a mess, also the smell is pretty pungent."
2,Not as expected,"This book might be acceptable for a high school or freshman college course. However, it is most certainly not useful for someone in graduate school or a professional. Arguments are elementary and information is limited. It is more concerned with facts or stating the obvious and not as focused on theory or research. I think there are much better books out there - even for high school or freshmen."
2,Sermon wrapped in a counseling session...,"This book is extremely dogmatic to the point of completely lying to reader so the point presented will seem valid. As a christian, and just as critically thinking person, this book is a frustrating read. It does not address some of the key scriptures you feel it should, and has a way of presenting makes you feel like a 6 year old kid starving for acceptance. If you are a believer of ""Once saved, always saved"" I would challenge you to read this from a unbiased perspective. Its interesting to see the lengths people will go to try and convey that they are right"
1,"Those who support Eternal Security, Stay Away.....","Ok,I was raised a BaptistAnd I am just a much as a believer in the doctrine of eternal security than anyone else.But take it from me, folks, for what its worth.This book is shallow, ill-written, and spends 30 percent of its pages on heavenly rewards, not the longevity of salvation.Mr. Stanley's book only weakens the reality behind the true nature of the gospel.Read at your own risk."
1,Poor exegesis,This work is based on some very shaky exegesis. I would not recommend this as a resource on the doctrine of Perseverance of the saints.
1,Not good,I don't smoke in my car. But did like to keep fresh.This is quiet an average product. Not too good as well. It was just a waste of money for me.Mathew.
1,Useless piece of junk,"I bought this on the strength of the many positive reviews. This is completely useless. I took over a lease from an 80 year old lady, so the car smelled a little musty and perfumy. I had the car detailed, only to have the car smell like perfumed shampoo.So I bought this thing, but it made absolutely no difference whatsoever. In the beginning, I had a faint burned smell. Afterwards? No effect at all. It's now going on 3 months."
2,Is this thing on?,"I've been using this thing for a few weeks and I can't tell if it's working or not. I don't have a smelly or smokey car or anything. Buti I have bad allergies. I honestly can't tell if it's working or not. I was hoping it would crisp the air in my car and hopefully help relieve allergies while driving but I'm not seeing a major impact. I really couldn't recommend this or anyone just looking to improve air quailty, specifically someone with allergies. But that's just my experience."
1,I wonder what it does,"It's always plugged in, in my car and I don't see any difference.I wonder what it does.Not worth buying."
1,Didn't work- Caused sore throat,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this product. My new/used car smelled horribly of stale cigarette smoke. In the reviews I read some people had experienced respiratory discomfort from the Ionic Air Purifier. I bought it anyway because I hoped I wouldn't be effected. I ran it first in the car for an hour without being in the car. When I got in and drove home I couldn't detect any difference in the gross smell, but by the time I got home, a 20 minute ride, my throat was sore. I used it a few more times, always with the same effect- the smell remained, my throat got sore. So I got the Dakota Odor Bomb for cars. The bomb works. It leaves a soapy smell that dissipates over a few weeks and then leaves a neutral air ""smell""."
4,Polluted City- Makes a difference,"Short and sweet. I live on the outskirts of a very polluted african city. When i drive down toward the polluted center...i keep the air ""recycled"" in the car. Usually when i arrive the smell inside is not different from the smog outside....After i bought this little purifier, when i reach the office and i open a window , I suddenly noticed a difference....in smell. But its a one hour drive....I am asthmatic...and i bought three of this little bugger coz i believe it does make a difference.Cheers.More than 2 years down..bought my second one and love it...."
2,Ionic Air purifier does not deliver.,This little device does not do much more than serve as a nightlight in my car. I bought this because my husband smokes in my car. I hate having a smoky smelling car but this device does not clear away the smoke smell. When I first put it in I thought it was doing something but it seems that the longer it runs the less it does. It does not seem to powerful enough to purify a whole car and I have a small car (Mitsubishi Lancer) perhaps if you have a car with multiple accessory outlets and you could use two of these device it might work but otherwise I don't believe it is really worth the money.
5,I love it,I have very bad allergy problems. This has helped out tremendously in my car. I would buy another one with hesitating. I highly reccomend it.
2,So... so,I haven't notice any difference. Buy a cabin air filter with odor eliminator in it instead. It has worked better for me than this Ionic Air Purifier.
1,Can't detect a difference,"I have had this unit for nearly a week at this point. After reading all the reviews I had high hopes for something inexpensive that would actually work in my truck. After a week of it running constantly I can not detect a thing. No change in odor, no Ozone smell, nothing, nadda, zip...."
2,Wagan : waste of time,I am a bit of a heavy smoker and bought this product to keep the smoke smell out of my car. Whenever I smoke I keep the car windows down. This product did NOTHING to remove the smoke or freshen the air.I won't be fooled twice!!
1,SORE THROAT REALLY BAD,"This thing gave me a really bad sore throat. It was not until I put ""2 and 2 together"" by reading these reviews, that I figuured out what was causing my sore throat at night. It was very painful and as soon as I unplugged this from my car, the sore throat disappeared the next night. Yikes !!!!"
2,Simple to the point review,I had this plugged in for a week. no change in the smell in my truck. so clearly it doesnt work. im pretty disapointed as i thought this was a really cool idea.
4,Working like a charm...,"This is cool...Its been 2 days and my the smell inside my car is almost goe. Honestly, the smell is still there, but its far better. It will take time, I know.I was really able to distinguish the smell whenever I got into my car and was very much disappointed by that. I was afraid to allow friends into my cars for so long...This i really cool and already started working..."
2,It's ok,"did not work as well as I thought it would and it fell apart pretty quickly, was not easy to clean either"
3,need to be replaced once a year.,"This thing worked pretty well in the beginning. I can detect the ozone while driving very easily. Over time, the ozone effect diminished. Not sure if it's due to me getting used to it or whether it became defective. After further usage, the ozone smell seems to come and go. Until one day, it started to create a loud buzzing noise whenever it was plugged in. Almost sounds like electric arcs.. I emailed Wagan(the manufacture) about this and they replied back with ""This kind of Ionizer, depending on use, usually needs to be replaced every 9-12 months. This probably explains the buzzing..""I had this thing plugged in constantly in my truck so I'm not sure if other people use it the same way. Mine lasted almost a year. At $10 a pop, it seems reasonable. For my next time, I will try to limit its usage to get more life out of it..."
2,Eh...not so great,Worked greast for a couple of weeks then faded little by little...at this rate I'd have to buy two a month. I think I'll just get something bigger and more expensive and leave it in the car over night.
3,Unknown effectiveness,"Bought the Wagan Ionic Air Purifier to try to eliminate a musty odor in my car.Left it ON for a day and a night, with windows closed. It had a nice, blue light (showing it was ON), but I don't know how effective it was at reducing the odor.After several days of airing out the car during the day, and using the Wagan at night, I think I detected the ""ozone odor"" that might have been produced by the device ... but do not know if I prefer the musty odor, the ozone odor, or if I was merely imagining things.No ion detector here, so can't comment on the ion production system.I guess I am giving the Wagan the benefit of the doubt with a ""3"" score, but I wish there were a better way to determine if the thing is actually emitting ions, let alone reducing odors."
3,Works kind of,"The Ionizer clears some odors and smoke from the car, but it does not create a clean, crisp smell. I am searching for a more effective ionizer-air cleaner."
4,Works,I only really have one comment to make. The ionizer works for sure but seems to lose some of its effectiveness over time.
1,Waste of Time and Money,"As soon as I saw the packaging for this product, I was skeptical. The plastic packaging for the product promised to ""help prevent accident."" Poor grammar aside, I don't exactly see a correlation between the air quality in your car and car accidents. I used the product for two days and air quality did not improve. I smelled auto emissions from other vehicles just as I had before using the product. I kept the purifier on for well over two hours during a long drive with no change in air quality. The product promised ""mountain-fresh air"" and failed to even come close to meeting this promise. I returned the purifier today."
3,Waga EL2022 ionic air purifier,My husband smokes when he drives my car. The ionic air purifier decreases the odor a great deal. I recommend this product.
3,not sure it does much,I could not really notice any difference in smell when this is plugged in. I do seem to get a headache when its running though.
3,Wagan Ionic Air Purifier and smoke,"I purchased this because the used truck I bought smells like it has been smoked in. After using the Wagan for a couple of days, it seems like the smell is less than before. I do not drive my truck much in the summer, so I may not have a good reference to make a judgment on this product yet."
3,Amos69er,"This thing does not do anything at all. I have had it in the car for several days and with out my being in the car, and when I did get in and drive, I could not tell there was anything at all working. I have a Lincoln Town car that still has the new smell, so maybe that is the problem. I would return it for a refund, but I do not want to fool with the hassle."
3,Air Purifier,I decided to buy this one too just to make sure one of the two works. I really was not impress with this one. I gave this one to my niece for her car and she like it.
4,My First Reich,"I picked this up on the cheap and am I glad! I love Reich's writing style - so much more mature than the other writers' ""female <detective,coroner,anthropologist>"" characters. Tempe Brennan did miss a bunch of really obvious clues, but I love the writing. She wasn't a weakling woman character. Very enjoyable! I went out and bought two more Reichs novels."
3,Too Much Coincidence this Time,"A nine-year-old-girl is murdered during a crossfire between motorcycle gangs. Tempe gets involved. During the investigation she manages to find a North Carolina/Montreal connection, which was a little coincidental in the last book, too much this time. The blood spatter description was way too long and unlike the forensic descriptions in her last two books, was boring. She fights too much with the cops and makes stupid decisions the Tempe in the first two books never would have made. Her nice guy nephew seems to have gotten all stupid as well. And if all that isn't enough, Reichs went a little over the top in making the bikers so bad.All that said though, I still found this to be a fast and pretty exciting read and am giving it three stars."
2,Deadly After Reading,"Predictable events in this story, with interesting forensic medical detail. Character development had limiting ceilings. Personalities were oil drenched cardboard. The bikers' unrelenting death wishes were devoid of spice and reality, which distracted from the plot. Kathy Reichs needs creative writing tutoring. She writes well, but needs streaks of lightening in dialog and presentation.I'm the author of the action adventure DUBROVNIK, the psychological drama KISSING FREUD and Marilyn Monroe returns in IT'S ALL MAKE BELIEVE, ISN'T IT?. You can preview and purchase my books here on amazon.com or on my secure site at [...]"
2,Implausible Plot,"From the author of ""Deja Dead,"" this is the story of forensic sleuth Tempe Brennan returning to Montreal to track down the killer of a child caught in a crossfire of gang warfare. Sometimes predictable, sometimes boring, but always true to the tired Patricia Cornwell formula."
2,Reads like a textbook,While I really enjoyed the first two Tempe Brennen Novels this was certainly a disappointment. I bought it in hardcover and I wish I had held out for paperback. This story has great potential but is so bogged down with medical jargon it's hard to concentrate on the story. I felt like I was back in science class.I think all the french and english mixed together is getting old to. It's hard to tell because I was so distracted trying to learn my degree in anthropology the story became secondary. I think based on her other 2 books she has great potential but Kathy Reichs needs to remember we're just everyday folk not scientists or anthropologists.I think the best advice she could get would be KEEP IT SIMPLE.
4,Another excellent Tempe Brennan novel,"Once again, Reichs delivers a fantastic Brennan novel. I like the way the characters age and develop as the series progresses. So many characters seem to be stuck in a time warp where they have one adventure after another but never seem to move in time."
2,"Eh, all right","There's nothing particularly wrong with Kathy Reichs' DEADLY DECISIONS, but there's nothing particularly right about it either. The plot, centered around a number of biker gang-related deaths, is serviceable, but I never found myself engrossed in it. I just wasn't that interested in who-done-it. I kept plodding through hoping to get hooked somewhere along the way, but closed the book after the last page thinking ""so what"".Reichs is a decent writer and her descriptions of the types of icky things a forensic pathologist does were interesting enough, I suppose. I won't say I'd never read another of her books, but I surely won't be rushing out to buy a first edition."
2,Good....but....,"I almost enjoyed this. I felt the plot was thin, the characterizations shallow. I think Ms. Reich compensated for the lack of depth in her story by filling the book with long passages involving very detailed descriptions of highly technical subjects. At times I forgot I was reading a novel, it felt more like a text book....a dull text book. I would have preferred more life in the characters and the plot."
3,Enjoyable read but too many motor clubs,"Forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan gets involved in the killings that occur when rivalling motor gangs start killing each other's members in Montreal in order to get hold of the profitable drug trade in the city. She uses all her forensic skills to determine who the victims are and who killed them. Meanwhile her 19 year old nephew Kit is staying at her place and his obsession with Harley Davidsons gets him in contact with some of the most dangerous figures of the gangs.The descriptions of the forensic work are revealing and realistic, which is no wonder when one considers that Kathy Reichs is a forensic anthropologist herself. However, the descriptions of all the rivalling motorclubs and their connections are tedious and every now and then I lost track who was a member of which motor club and which motor club had a feud with which other motor club."
2,"Uninteresting, unconvincing and unsubstantial","Being a bright forensic anthropologist does not mean a succesful crime fiction writerIn light of the author background and loving hard boiling crime fiction I picked this book with great expectation looking for its ""added value"", that is elaborated scientific explanations through the analysis of forensic evidence discovered in circumstances that encircle a well crafted crime fiction plot. Unfortunately I was utterly dissapointed, that was not what I have found, and many times along the chapters was uncertain whether or not to put this book downIn exchange for my ""deadly decision"", I have come upon a bunch of dull cardboard characters, careless writing syle, useless and fluffy house chore details and unevolved portraits of places and situations in a unclear attempt to run an inside story of the underworld of outlaw biker gangs"
4,"A normal, sensitive, feminine girl...","Tempe the forensic anthropologist is cleverly portrayed as insightful and incisive .. but also as quite vulnerable and fallible ... and as a very caring person in all the series so far. She is sensitive and normal, a feminine woman. [I suspect Kathy is, too] (Why do so many girls/women take a feminist stance! -the truly great don't need to!) The shockingly terrible murders take a huge toll on her but she perseveres and prevails. Tempe is a major newcomer to the genre. [This book rates 9 out of ten (that level all the way through!) My final score or 4 out of 5 stars [I am rating the book!] reflects only my reluctance to give 5/5. Can we not have a 4.5 score?] Keep your place on the pedestal, Kay Scarpetta, but make room for Tempe up there."
1,Deadly Dull!!!!!!!,"Liked the first one am so sorry I spent money on this book. Never Never AGAIN. Who wrote it?Plot is slim to none,writing is boring unless you want to know in great detail ( for no apparent reason) all the buzz words of Canada and US forensic's, nothing ties together, half the time she skipped between the two countries till I never did figure out why or where she was. Never wrote a bad review before, but couldn't resist on this one."
4,I Love Kathy Reichs,"Read all of Kathy Reichs' books! ""Deadly Decisions"" is another exciting book from Ms. Reichs. What makes her writing more interesting is Ms. Reichs is a real life forensic anthropologist (hope I spelled it correctly); I wonder if her stores are based on real cases."
1,Who Cares?,"I kept hearing about how great Kathy Reichs was -- ""better than Cornwell"" they told me. Hooey! If this is an example of her exciting books, I'll pass. Like Peggy Lee I kept wondering ""is that all there is?"" Sadly and disappointingly, like Gertrude Stein, I had to conclude: ""There's no there there."" Skip this one for sure."
4,Forensics Intrigue,"An expert in her field of forensic anthropology, Reichs, through her character, Tempe Brennan, educates us on this fascinating but slightly unknown field through her crime-fighting novel. Only personal knowledge and experience can bring the authenticity that is demonstrated in the story.Deadly Decisions is an intricate story with just the right amount of technical information. Reich's characters are real and you can't help but like the heroine. A fast read that will keep you up late turning pages."
3,Not too deep,Typical Temperance Brennan novel. Good for a bus commute read or vacation read when your brain needs a literary break. Still stimulating and entertaining. A little more intriguing than some at first. Quick read.
4,Another good read,"I can't say enough about Kathy Reichs books. This one is as good as the others, as enthralling, and makes me want to go back to school and study forensics!"
2,A FORENSIC TEXTBOOK,"An I the only one who found that this book read more like a forensic textbook that a novel? I have read the two previous books and enjoyed them but this latest is too plodding - and do we really need three pages on the meaning of blood spatters? I pre-ordered this book, couldn't wait for it to be published, and then was very disappointed with it. Sorry."
1,don't bother,"i'm sorry but i don't understand any of the good reviews, this book was the most cliched, unexciting book i've ever finished.I read about a book a week and couldn't wait to have it end. Don't bother wasting your money and time"
2,Pardon My French,"This is the first book by Kathy Reichs that I have read, and it is definitely the last one by Reichs that I will read. It drags slowly for the first half, and never reaches anything approaching fast pace. Scribner needs to do better proofreading also, spelling ""Shallotte"" two different ways, using ""television"" in one paragraph, followed by ""TV"" in the next paragraph. And Reichs using French phrases detracts from the readability of the book - using the English equivalent would not have broken my concentration.Reichs book would be better if she dropped the French, dropped useless Ryan from the plot, and sped up the pace."
3,A good read,"Ahhhh.. Still not as good as her first one, but still a decent crime thriller. Reichs introduces some new twists for her heroine to deal with, and I like the way she handles the very contraversial subject of the book. I learnt a lot reading this book - as much as I was entertained by it!"
3,Not a Harley lover.,"Bikers are scary :) My daughter was in pediatric intensive care one Christmas when some local bikers came by to hand out presents to all of the kids. Nice. They still scared the hell out of me. Why does Tempe never tell anyone where she's going to be? Why doesn't she carry a gun or a knife? She's always getting the crap kicked out of her and never has anything to defend herself with! AND BE NICER TO RYAN!!!! The ""tension"" between those two gets old...really fast.I still enjoyed the book and will continue to buy future additions to the series."
4,GREAT READ,"This is my second Temperance Brennan book. In this one, Tempe tries to unravel a series of murders by outlaw biker gangs. The two that interest her most are the murder of a child in a crossfire and the bones of a sixteen year old girl found partly in Quebec and partly in Myrtle Beach. The novel moves fast, is pretty gory at times, and has a high body count. It definitely kept my interest."
3,Not good shape.,"This book, which is very good, was a fun one to read. My only complaint was that this book was suppose to be in good condition. The pages were all stained dark yellow (from age I'm assuming) and the cover was pretty torn. This was probably just because of where I purchased it from. The ended up returning it and buying a nook, which I love!, and gettign all my books on there. This book was very good. Kathy just keeps getting better as she writes her books. I love this series and am on the 5th book right now."
4,A great forensic thriller.,"This is a great book. It takes you through the inside culture of a biker club. She talks to you in the book so you know what is going on without using a lot of medical terms. I really enjoyed this book, you will too."
2,disappointing descision,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thorougly enjoyed Reich's earlier works and was eager to read Deadly Decisions. However, the story gets bogged down in technical talk...the details on blood spatter analysis and how they put motorcyles together could have been easily eliminated and then more space would have been left for the story!"
2,Ms. Reichs: Keep Your Day Job,"Ms. Reichs is by profession a pathologist. Please don't give that up. This book has a cast as long as your arm, along with many biker clubs & their affiliates. Apparently Ms. Reichs believes bikers are all druggies or murderers. Not a good one in the bunch. Throw in Kit, her very corny nephew and you have the makings for a not so good novel.The story seems not to be able to stay focused. It begins to wander out of control. There are sub-stories to be had which deter the main story even further. The the novel just is not focused at all. 2/3 of the way through, I found I just didn't care how this thing turned out. Please, send Kit back to Texas, stay away from bikers & their clubs, focus on your profession & give us readers a gentle break"
3,"A ""transitional"" mystery","K. Reichs' third Temperence Brennan mystery rewards the loyal reader on only one of two levels. Least rewarding: Temperance's perserverance as a crime fighter are put to the test by the volume of victims, and none to appealing this time around. The deaths by bombing, drive-by shooting, hit man shooting, etc., pretty much become a blur by the book's halfway point. What kept me turning the pages? The mysteries in Brennan's complicated personal life-- a nephew that may be a flaky and danger-prone as Brennan's sister; a lover who is intriguingly (and frustratingly) incommunicado for the bulk of the novel; and a detective who has grudgingly helped Brennan in the past, but may now jeopardize her loved ones. I think fans should view this book much like a plausible and necessary stepping stone to a more fulfilling next book. The sea changes in the relationships set up in this novel, teamed with a more satisfying criminal mystery, could make Reichs' next work a five-star treat."
5,Another Great Book!,Deadly Decisions is another great book by Kathy Reichs. She never lets us down. I have enjoyed every one of her books and this is no exception. The writing is excellent as are her stories. Please try one and you will want all the others. Terrific Books!
1,Do NOT buy a POLAROID DVD PLayer,"I bought a similar portable DVD player from Polaroid and it's amazing how similar my experience is with all the other low scores in these reviews. It seemed to work fine for a few months of very light use. At about 6 months, it just stopped working correctly. It would jerk and freeze up whenever you tried to play a dvd. Polaroid has LOUSY support and wouldn't even respond to my emails. Please check the length of the warranty before buying anything by Polaroid. Mine was for only 3 months and even though it died at 6 months, they don't care. Not worth your money."
3,Check the cord??,"The player works okay but we have had problems with the cord, and had to order a new one. It has been an extra expence, we didn't plan to replace the cord in less than a year. Even with that our girls have been very rough on the player (dropping it, spilling stuff on it...) and it doesn't seem to have any problems. We would buy this item again if we were sure our first cord was just faulty and not something that happens all the time."
1,JUNK,"I bought this DVD player before taking my four year old son on a long train ride (27 hours). I received it from Amazon right before the trip, I did not have time to check to see if it worked, I just charged the battery and packed it in my carry-on. When I tried to play a movie on it, it read the DVD fine, and the sound worked fine, but the screen did not work at all!!I adjusted the contrast and brightness and everything, and I tried different DVD's, and the screen still did not work!! The screen was all black with just shadow's moving across it. I tried it a few more times after reaching my destination and the day before we got back on the train, and it worked once. As soon as I got home, I sent it back to Amazon and I am awaiting a credit for it. I would not recommend this DVD player."
3,REally thick!!!!,"i purchashed this item so i could play my video game consoles on it, and wish i had gave more thought into buying it , although its led and capable of the av in/out switch i really wanted. its small and would have spent a little more money on a portable dvd player that has a bigger screen and more light weight, because it is portable...it needs to be light weight to carry along!! i should have really gave this 2 stars but its my fault for buying a 7""."
1,Terrible!,"Oh but it worked just fine while under warranty - 3 months. Then all I get is black and white. Do you think my 3 kids want to watch black and white movies all the way to Florida? Buy something else. Oh yeah, when I call customer service they basically told me 'too bad, you are out of warranty. only thing we can do is replace it for $90.00' Uh, I don't think so..."
3,You get what you pay for,"and in my case, it was free. Our company gave it to employees for Christmas '04. I only use it on long flights or train rides, about once a month, and it still works just fine. The only problem I've had, aside from the short battery life, is that the battery doesn't seem to fit very securely and I have to be careful when moving the unit while it's playing, or I loose power. I use it with high-quality digital headphones, and the sound is great. I like that its wide screen, since all my movies are in that format for my home TV. I don't use it for CD's because I have an iPod, so I don't know how well, or bad, it plays CD's. But all-in-all, its not a bad DVD player."
3,Too much hero worship.,"In the history of rock music, including all genres, it is difficult to overstate the influence of Metallica. They are constantly growing and developing their art, and trials and tribulations aside, continue to produce excellant music. It is fascinating to read a retrospective of the creative process of the band, song by song, with an emphasis on the lyrics. HOWEVER, the author lays the hero worship too thick at times, and takes away the credibility of the book. It isn't necessary, as they are a great band and a compelling story. It is still good enough to read, and the pictures are great, but spare me the over the top, walk on water attitude."
4,Interesting range of ideas,"This book offers an insightful study of Welle's most accomplished work. It also stands as a testimony to what could have been had the studio RKO not interfered during the editing stage of the film.Perkins apparent love of the filmic medium helps to wrap this book into tightly wrought 74 pages which though brief, covers alot of ground.An excellent companion to the film."
1,wrong item,ordered wrong wanted the novel.too m any words needed to do this surveys...thats why i do not always do it
5,Great story from Cassie,"I have read many of Cassie Edward's books, and this one is my favourites, and the book that made me want to buy more of her books. It is funny, touching and makes you want to read it again and again. However, I must say that her books published in the 2000s are not as good as the books that were published at almost the same time as Savage Heart. Seems like she runs out of ideas...I still love Cassie and hope she will write more great books again, like before..."
2,Eh,"Having read several of these Savage books, I found this one to be lackluster. The four I have already read follow pretty much the same formula - Indian kidnaps white girl, white girl fights at first but then surrenders and falls in love with him, some people (Indians and whites) disapprove of the union but in the end everyone lives happily ever after.Edwards does a nice job of describing colonial or Indian life, so thumbs up for research. Generally, Edwards does a decent job with the lovemaking scenes, but her phrase of 'love cave' to describe a woman's lady parts just made me laugh out loud (it's used a couple of times in this book) Also, she abuses ellipses and uses them way too often, so some... sentences have... like, three... or four... ellipses... and it's really... really annoying...If not for the repetitive storyline and the abuse of ellipses, I'd have given this book a higher rating."
2,Filled with 4-letter words; dull plot,"I found this very disappointing ... It was filled with very crude language, and the plot seemed ridiculously contrived. The character was very interesting, and this could be the beginning of a great series if the language were not so foul, and the plot were a little more believable."
4,I loved Miss Ruby,"When you read Maid in the Shade you'll feel like Ruby is a real person. Her observations, feelings and reactions make perfect sense. There is nothing artificial about this character (including a few mild curse words that are appropriate for the their context) and I can't wait for Jacqueline Turner Banks to write a sequel. More Ruby please!"
5,McNally's Folly,"I've read every Lawrence Sanders book written, and absolutely loved the Archy series. I was devastated when Lawrence Sanders passed away, wondering if I'd ever enjoy Archy's antics again. The last book, and McNally's Folly were both throughly enjoyable. I just can't get enough of Archy, Al Rogoff and all the zany characters in Palm Beach. Mr. Lardo does an excellent job of carrying on a storyline that makes me smile and giggle out loud at Archy's little adventures. If you're a McNally fan you won't be dissappointed with Vincent Lardo keeping Archy alive. P.S. The Hampton Affair by Vincent Lardo is also excellent. I'm looking forward to his new one coming soon, and hopefully some more of Archy McNally."
5,Archy McNally Survives,"I have been hooked on this series from the start. The author although not Lawrence Sanders is excellent in preserving the tone and feel of the characters in the previous novels. The story kept me interested. I remember being skeptical when the James Bond series was continued after Ian Fleming died, but the new author John Gardner, while unlike Lardo was a known writer on his own, kept me reading. I look forward to more McNally volumes."
2,Archy has lost his sparkle,"That inherrent something ""Archy"" about Archy McNally seems to have died with Sanders. While Lombardo seems quite capable, Archy seems to be turning into one of those eccentric bachelor men you just sort of feel sorry for. He used to be mischevious, now he seems more self-centered. I guess (correctly) at who did it (though not the means of delivering the poison); what character was a red herring; and what I thought were some very obvious connections between various agencies. All in all, an easy, pleasant read, but not anything like the earlier books."
4,A late bloomer but still nice.,"Perhaps Lardo has finally found his stride and fallen into step. This novel is a particularly good read. Don't take it seriously and you will do fine. Buy it in paperback if you must have a copy, otherwise check it out of the local library. Enjoy the book for the fun of it then move on."
4,"Close, but no cigar!","Sanders and I go clear back to The First Deadly Sin. His descrptions of food and dress have always been entertaining to me. When Archy first appeared on the scene I felt he was a light weight compared to other characters, but I grew to love him anyway. Lardo has done an amazingly good job in picking up the threads. The plot was obvious, I had it figured out almost from the beginning. You need to work on that Vince. Sanders kept us guessing to the end. Please keep going, I would miss Archy when I need something funny and light."
2,McNally-lite (pretty tough since McNally was already light),"It takes only a few paragraphs to tell that Lawrence Sanders is gone. I never thought that the McNally books were Sanders best work, but now that he's gone, and someone's taken over the series, I realize that Sanders did a better job with this series than I had thought.This book really needed an editor. There are missing transitions, strange references to events we had not read about, and a general lack of attention to detail.Also, I figured the entire story out very early in the game, and that's something I usually don't do. It makes Archy seem stupid, instead of just amusingly casual, in his detecting."
3,Not Lawerence Sanders,"The story is good, and follows the tradition of the MaNally books. But it does not have the same feel, I just didn't get the same impressions from the main character, Archy McNally!"
2,McNalleys Folly,I didn't think this Archie McNally story was up to Lawrence Sanders usual quality. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but the person who has read all his books and needs this one to complete the series.
4,Excellent for the novice ~ it cuts to the chase.,"Doug captures your attention right from the start and keeps it. Soon you are in the heart of things.I would suggest you view this tutorial on a seperate player next to your Vegas software so you can experiment as you go.I am giving this 4.5 stars only because his pointer was hard to detect and follow. It should have been a bold red color or flashing perhaps.In addition to that because I am a ""Novice of the first form"" I was hoping he would tell you how to switch back and forth from a frontal and sideshot view of a speaker on two cameras/tracks and keep the sound in sync.Other than that it was an excellent piece of work for the used purchase price.I am very comfortable with spending $80 to $100 for this set. Over $100 in my opinion is a little pricey."
4,Great Book If You Need Help With Your Homework!,"This book helped me with my homework. It has all of the answers to the odd homework problems that are given from Introductory Statistics by Prem S. Mann sixth edition. This book includes the step by step way to solve the problems to each odd question. It helps when you have no idea how to work a problem, and you do not have anyone to ask for help. This book was passed around my statistics class. People were so addicted to it that I stopped bringing it to class. It will really help you if you use it as a reference for when you are stuck, not for copying every homework assignment. The college actually banned it from the bookstore."
4,Tim Holt Westerns,"I like the old Tim Holt western movies, especially his side kick .FunnyI'v looked a long time for the movies"
3,"This is NOT the Disney Goofy, rather it's other goofy stuff.","This video is a compilation of things that people have done in the past such as being shot out of a cannon at a circus and other such ""goofy"" stuff. It is not about the Walt Disney character, Goofy."
5,Wonderful Music- Americana to the core,"Laura Karpman has managed to create beautiful music here- this music just happens to be a score to ""Taken."" I would urge anyone who is a fan of American classical music (Copland, Berstein, Williams, etc.) to buy this soundtrack. It is very Americana and simply gorgeous, mysterious, longing and joyous all at the same time. I'll admit I'm partially biased because I really liked the mini-series ""Taken,"" but my roommate just walked into the room and listened for a while and said, ""What is that? I really like it,"" and he hasn't even heard of ""Taken,"" much less seen it. My only criticism is that they did not include the 'end credits' music on the album. Either way, it's still wonderful music."
5,Taken Away By The Sound,Taken is exactly what occurs when you become mesmerized by the haunting music score composed by Laura Karpman. The visuals were solidly underscored by the music that eerily and brilliantlycast shadow and light on the drama involved. The music of Taken is a neo classic and will stand the test of time for listeners who appreciate fine music.
5,HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE NEW MUSIC,"The score sounded like a fine symphony to me. The variety of rhythms and moods were very appealing. I liked the recurrence of a main theme, yet that melodic theme did not overwhelm. Sophisticated and very appealing."
1,amateur brainwashing.,"This was the first book I read to aid me in going raw. Unfortunately I was so put off by how idiotic the writers sounded, I returned it and put off going raw for awhile. A plain insult to one's intelligence. I agree with most of the comments here, especially the ""cooked food is poison"" remark, which stirred me up just as much, and the religion remark. Made me wonder if maybe they were missing a few sanity nutrients from cooked food.That was a joke, you rawies can put your heavy artillery away!Thankfully other books have had a better effect and actual facts to support claims, as opposed to, well, cooked food is poison.. cooked food is poison.. cooked food is poison.. cooked food is poison.. cooked food is poison.. cooked food is poison..."
1,Where did they get their information?,"When you write a non-fiction book, you are supposed to include references. This book has very, very few. Some of the so-called ""references"" shouldn't even be included. Here's an example of a reference from Appendix C of the book: ""The reason scientists do experiments on animals is because cooked-food addiction has severely clouded everyone's mind. They cannot think for themselves. They cannot see reality, so they need their proof demonstrated to them by torturing defenseless creatures(p.206)."" The entire book consists of this type of emotionally charged but scientifically unsound propaganda.It's a shame, because I really believe that eating a raw food diet is one of the most healing things you can do for your body. But this book doesn't focus on the positive aspects of eating raw fruits and vegetables nearly as much as it does with statements like ""dead, cooked corpses are the sources of unnatural diseases (p.19)."""
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!,"Could this book be anymore poorly written?! It is basically a collection of the author's passionate opinions. There are no facts or even decent arguements for their views. Throughout the entire book they tell you what they believe and that they are right, no doubt about it. It is so sad that they wasted so much time and energy writing this horrible book. The saddest part is that it has potentially good information in it, but the authors' writing styles ruin it.While reading the book I kept asking myself. ""Hmm, are these guys really horrible authors or is this what happens to your brain when you start eating a raw diet?""Please, don't waste your money!!!"
2,Unscientific arguments are not motivational,"I was already on a 100% raw food diet, and this book was almost offensive enough to convince me to go back to cooked food. Maybe some people find ""cooked food is poison"" repeated approximately 50 times to be a satisfactory argument, but I consider it to be wasted space in which they could have cited the actual science behind raw foodism. Instead, the authors' apparent science phobia leads them to such nonsensical reasoning as ""no scientists have proven that viruses are alive, therefore they probably don't exist."" (In case readers don't understand why this is nonsense, I'll cite an example: I have a computer in front of me. It has not been proven to be alive. Does it exist?) I sincerely hope that these authors consider taking an elementary science course (perhaps biology or chemistry) before writing their next book. They have a wonderful message, but books like this are the reason many people consider raw foodists to be maniacal zealots."
1,Blatantly plagiarized!!!,"""Nature's First Law: The Raw Food Diet"" was blatantly (mostly, word for word) plagiarized from the classic book ""Raw Eating"" by Arshavir Ter Hovannessian. In fact, the trio is the foremost authority on plagiarism in the raw food movement and their website is censored. This involves the deletion of any mention of their acts of plagiarism, which occurred more than once. The classic original has been recently reprinted. Get the original, instead."
1,Turned Off,"I found out that raw foods are a godsend for health and well-being. No thanks to NFL.I found the book to be offensive, fanatical in tone, filled with errors (raw fruit juice as good as mother's milk? Puhleeze.), and, frankly, offensive. Some of the statements made were so erroneous that I found myself yelling at the book while reading! The constant ""cooked food is poison"" diatribe throughout book was irritating.There are many other wonderful books out there on raw food and changing your diet. Because this one was essentially useless and filled with incredible errors (too many to list here!), this is one I can't recommend. Try ""Blatant Raw Food Propoganda."" Or many of the ""cook"" books. You'll be much better served and your senses won't be offended by out-and-out falsehoods. If this was the only book available on raw food eating, I'd be living at Burger King."
2,An in-your-face approach to raw-foodism,"The three authors make it a point in getting across their beliefs on raw-foodism. Yet, their way of doing it is very harsh. They tell it like it is. It's all or nothing for these guys. I wouldn't recommend this as your first raw-food book. My first impression of the book was a bit cult-ish. They end every chapter with the sentence, ""Cooked food is poison"" They want to hammer it into your brain. Start out with ""The Raw Life"" and ""The Sunfood Diet Success System"", then you should be able to handle this book."
1,Not worth your time or money,"This book is filled with nothing but blathering gibberish. There is no information. I am a raw foodist and I am not reviewing the raw food diet, I am reviewing this book and it is a waste of paper."
1,There are better things to do with your money...,"This book is not motivating, is not well written and as someone said, followed no logical pattern.For those ""enthusiastic"" souls who were quite liberal with handing out stars (Where were you when I was in grammar school), I have a sneeking suspicion that the folks at NFL (Nature's First Law)have been stuffing the ballot.In the long run I think a raw food approach to eating has a lot of validity. I have read other books on raw foodism by other authors that were better written and more fluid in their information.I think David Wolfe has quite a bit of potential, I have heard him on CoasttoCoastAM.com and he was very well spoken and informed. I believe he can become a real leader in the world of raw eating.So, buy this at your own risk, and see how you like it."
1,What a rip-off,"This book is a blatant rip-off of Aterhov's ""Raw Eating"". They took Aterhov's work and reworded everything. Sad...Unfortunately Aterhov's is out of print...""Nature's First Law"" is still a good book, but only cuz it's a rip off of a classic."
2,Angry Tone,"I bought this book thinking it will further educate me to the positive effects of eating raw. Continuously, angry adoloscent communication is portrayed throughout the book. I feel the book was written to offend, criticize and judge those who do not hold the belief that the body can heal itself by eating raw food. I was looking for a more mature book from authors like Ann Wigmore;Leslie and Susannah Kenton-Raw Energy; Norman Walker; Harvey and Marilyn Diamond. I wanted actual information on the positive effects that transpire in the body not judgements on those that aren't interested in better health through a raw diet. There are positive important facts given in the back of the book that will open your eyes to our food and our health."
3,"Good, but dogmatic","This book takes no prisoners. The message is clear: ""Eat raw or die, cooked food is poison"". This message is pounded into you with each chapter. I would have like a bit more variety in the topics and considerably more science to back up the claims for raw foodism. I would also like to have some research on raw animal foods, which can certainly supply deficits in the raw vegan diet (i.e. vitamins B12,D). Having adopted a raw diet myself to lose weight, I have to agree with the authors that one can pretty much eat any raw foods as desired and still loose weight. I eat at will including such ""forbidden foods"" as avocado & coconut oil and still lose weight every week, which is something I need to continue doing until I reach a good weight. I feel better than I ever have. This book may sound awfully dogmatic in places, but it will help you if your quest is to eat raw. Read it."
1,don't waist your money,"I am into the raw foods diet, have never felt better in my life, but I think this book is pretty useless. Just babbles on and on, with occational bits of helpful info.. I also don't care for the fanatical style of writing."
1,"Yes, Cooked Food Is Poison, We Get The Point","This book was great. And then you reach the end of every chapter to see the line ""Cooked food is poison."" REALLY ANNOYING! So, I was so annoyed by the repeated ANNOYING ""Cooked food is poison"" that I didn't even read 1/3 of the book."
1,review,"I found this book very negatively written. I was quite disappointed. As a therapist I write many different types of reports. The way this book is written I would call it a ""deficit"" type of report, not the whole picture. The book fosters guilt for those that choose not to adopt a 100% raw food diet. Life is not about absolutes. There are many factors that influence our choices. Acceptance is something that should be practiced by all. This book is about judgement not acceptance. I actually choose to eat most of my food raw and still felt guilty and negative after reading this book. I would definitely not recommend it to someone to read in order to change their diet from cooked to raw."
1,It deserves a zero,"This was one of the first books I bought when starting the raw path, it's embarassing, if you want to use the Bible as reference to what to eat, you'll eat everything, from veggies to fish and bread, I don't like when someone uses a book or a research and cuts out only what agreed with his feelings or ideas or what hi/she's trying to sell, and they've copied Hovanessian's book, that says all about them."
5,Boston Baked Beans,"One of my favorites. I have always liked them, so ordered them when saw them online. Only problem is that number in each box has been reduced. I remember when they were twice the size and the box was full, for only .10 box."
4,Good price and arrived timely :),Definitely a great price (with the free 2 day shipping to boot). The product was well packaged and came in time. I gave these as part of a Christmas package bundle for friends. Great product and tastes great!
1,Just not what I remember,They are like chewing sugar cubes. The nut has no flavor. YukJust not up to my memories standards. I think the ones I had were not smooth but bumpy.
2,My pigs dont like this brand.,My pigs dont like this brand.I think oxbow is better. So I will purchase the oxbow hay next time.
1,Not captivating,"I am a Vietnam War history buff, but I just couldn't get into this book at all. Not because the material isn't good, it is just presented poorly."
3,Misleading and Not What You Think It Is,I am an avid reader of Vietnam War history and was very disappointed in this book. I thought it was about men who stayed behind during the war and it isnt. It is about a few folks who went back after coming home. It is interesting at times and one or two of the characters are worth the read but overall found it to be misleading and uninteresting at best. Only if youre a serious reader of history does this make it interesting.
4,Good book even if you're only casually sporty...,"I am more of a fan of KO's political career, and only have half-hearted knowledge of The World Of Sports(Not to worry, I still enjoy a Dick Trickle joke!) I'm still glad my friend recommended this book. Keith and Dan's humor, passion, and the way they must have worked together really does translate on the page. I can see why Aaron Sorkin was inspired by them. I think there must be at least a chuckle on every page..."
4,Great Easy Read,"I love sports and I love Keith Olbermann, so a book about sports and ESPN written by Keith Olbermann was a triple threat! It's an insider's look at the birth and childhood of ESPN with lots of rye wit from Keith. It's a great read when you just want to relax and have a few laughs."
2,The Big Show was okay but could have been better.,"Keith and Dan are very candid with their remarks, but I really do not rate this book as high as most of the books I have read."
4,"""Gone...""","I just saw a Sport Center segment and I pulled this book out. This was the start of something special. All the sportcasters with irreverent comments and phrases...it began in earnest with these two. This was the golden era of Sport Center...Great insight and I love the phrases. It does read like the stories that those two used to do. The Big Show...Sunday Nights......And surprisingly, it ended with grace...remembering Tom Meese.If you are a fan in any way, shape or form of Sports Center, get this book!"
4,Must Get for any Fan of SportsCenter,"This book was a great and easy read. The only flaw is the lack of humor that the show it's about is so famous for. I especially enjoyed the chapter that focused on how to become a sports broadcaster. Before I read it I had no idea the work you had to put in to become what these two men have become. It definitely made me think twice about what I wanted to do with my life and how I was going to do it. Some of this book is funny, some parts are poignant, but most of it is just biographical. If you enjoy these two men, the show, or are interested in becoming a sports broadcaster read this book."
3,Good not great,I really like TDA. They sound much better in person. The accordian solos are fun to listen to.
5,Widell Lays it down,"Grab your beach towel, throw on your flip flops, and don't forget to put your Todd Widell CD on your ipod (the beach is no place for a CD player). This is the perfect CD to relax to, but don't pass of Widell's music as just laid back beach music. In his debut album he throws out so many things that are strong themes for younger people, struggling with relationships, flourishing in relationships, doing what you want to be doing with your life... These are just some of the many great things that are brought out in Late Night Saturday. Todd plays a little acoustic and a little electric. If you like Bob Schneider, Pete Yorn, Jack Johnson - even a little Ryan Adams then Widell is your man."
3,"Good concept, bad execution","The opening of the book is one of the more intersting openings that I have read. The contrast between the super-popular high school students and those on the outside are confirmed by both teenage culture and adult culture. While this book could have been a great examination of these forces, it ended up being a trite, sterotypical novel. My high rating is given becasue the style was good and was a quick read. This novel would best be read in an airport waiting for a plane, something quick and light that does not require much thinking"
2,Not for the Practical Minded,"This book addresses some basic elements of mindreading (like ascertaining someone's interest in an object from her/his eye direction) but does not substantively address real-world applications (the way that we observe and interpret subtle gestures and vocal intonation to form an idea of other people's thoughts in daily life). Instead, the book includes extensive descriptions of scientific experiments on animals and humans. The author discusses the development of mindreading capabilities in early childhood but does little to link this information to related findings on brain development. The book's focus on mindreading deficiencies in autistic people often seems insensitive and uncompassionate."
3,Not as good as it said,"The book is interesting, but the book is not in an organized format. and it haven't mention too much about the most important thing - mindreading."
3,Kurt just couldn't hack it,"Blue Gold is a book that attempts to be a Dirk Pitt novel with all of the actions and explosions, yet the title characters just don't have the development and attitudes to carry the book through to the end. Possibly, if Cussler attempts to continue the series, this character development will arrive, but if you are interested in a Dirk Pitt book, this is not one, or even like one. Stick to the classic over the top attituedes of Al G. and Dirk."
4,Where are Dirk and Al?,"The style is still there...adventure, but the main characters seem like ""remakes"" of our favorites, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino. The story line is very good and holds your interest throughout the book. I just kept waiting for Dirk and Al. I'll read more of these, of course, because they are always exciting."
4,Exciting Listening,"Listened to this book on a trip to deliver my daugher to college. Cussler is one of my daughter's favorite authors. This is the first book of his that I have ever listened to/read. I really enjoyed it. We enjoyed David Purdham's narration. It was a great way to make the miles fly by. Good fun. I will listen/read more of Cussler's books now. This is also a good choice for teen readers who skip all the good YA books and go staight to ""grown up"" books."
4,Good Second Book,"Again, this is a good book in this series. I could not put it down. Good twisted ending also.I'm not going to rehash the plot.... If you liked the first one... you will like this one also."
2,not up to expectations.,"i have read a few of clive cussler's other books, dirk pitt adventures, and this is really a let down. it has a couple of funny lines, but that is about all. i would suggest ""inca gold"" instead. much better."
4,Not his best but still readable!,The beginning was great I was hooked. the ending let me down though.
2,Tarnished,"Unlike the Dirk Pitt series, the adventures of Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala in ""Blue Gold"" are not only well-worn but highly improbable. Granted, the Dirk Pitt series isn't realistic, but the plot was belted out with such panache and humor that a good read was guaranteed. The same cannot be said, however, for Kurt Austin in Blue Gold.Rarely suspenseful or even exciting, Blue Gold is at best a cure cure for insomnia- definitely not comparable with the sterling Dirk Pitt collection."
1,Blue Gold,Ok guys this one is worse than bad. The writing is sophmoric choppy short sentences with a failure to develop the story line fully. I have read all but three of Cussler's Dirk Pitt books plus Serpent and thoroughly enjoyed them all. Blue Gold does not even come close to an exceptable Cussler standard. I have to ask what Clive Cussler is doing putting his name on such poor quality work.
2,What a let down!,"I have read the entire Cussler series and always wait in great expectation for the next book. This was a major fumble! The story line was typical, predictable and unimaginable. The villians and locations were put together as is they were a ""made for TV movie"" script. The only interesting part involved the discovery of the ""flying wing"" and even that led no where. I think Clive Cussler had little imput in the writing of this novel, and Paul Kemprecos pushed out a book with Cussler's name. Save the time reading this novel and find something a bit more riveting and original."
4,Another Cussler book for my e reader,"Usual Cussler story. Worth reading, not so sure if its worth the price with all of the other books available for DL"
3,BLUE GOLD,"I still hope a good story is in Clive but when Dik Pitt is retired, to new caractors are created they are mirror reproduced and it takes away from the book."
2,not up to par,We love Cusslers books and really enjoyed Serpent. Blue Gold seems to have been written quickly and without much thought for any orginality. Totally predictabl. We are hoping that this is a one time deal.
1,Blue Gold,"This book is a real let-down in the Clive Cussler series of novels from the NUMA files. The book has a contributing co-author(Paul Kemprecos), and it appears if he wrote the whole book. The main character, Kurt Austin, couldn't lick the boots of Dirk Pitt,Cussler's usual main character..The book is filled with unrealistic escapes from dangerous spots, and there are far too many coincedences to get the characters out of tight spots. The book gets maybe 1 star."
1,His Worst Yet!,"The saddest part, after being a loyal Dirk Pitt fan for the last 15 years, is each book is now getting prorgressively worse. The plots are not only completely implausible and just downright stupid, but they are carried out by protagonists that could only exist in ancient Greek mythology. The simple-minded plot 'twists' are written for my nine-year-old to understand, but the problem is my nine-year-old is a smart kid, and he laughed out loud at the silliness when he read this. Cussler has entertained for years, but apparently used an Excel spreadsheet to do a side by side comparison when trying to come up with a new 'hero' for the new millenium. Take some time off, Clive, and go find some sunken ships instead."
2,"Good read, but dissapointing...","This second installment of the novels with Kemprecos is readable but certainly not memorable. I don't particularly think that Cussler was much involved with this novel and it shows, the story line is just too tired. However, I read it and enjoyed it. A quick read, not much in depth and not much in the true 'Cussler tradition'. I would recommend the book, but just don't expect much from it. It is entertaining, but not very detailed. Hopefully, the next DirkPitt adventure will measure up to the other excellent works by Cussler..."
2,Disappointing Cussler Book,"I have read many Cussler books, including NUMA books, this is a book I cannot recommend. I'm surprised Cussler allowed his name to grace this book."
5,Clusser Rocks.,"This is a great book, just what I expected to read from the pen of Clive Cussler. I am looking forward to more of his books."
3,Fans of Cussler will enjoy - but get a better proof-reader,"If you are familiar with Clive Cussler's brand of novels, you will likely enjoy this one. The standard formula exists as exists in almost every other one of the many novels he has written or co-written.I am troubled by the overuse of similes. I think I could teach an entire course of simile use just using one of Cussler's works. Also, some of the writing was just downright sloppy. For example: ""Remembering how a tiny piece of metal had helped track down the source of the TWA jet explosion over Lockerbee, Scotland, Austin figured even the tiniest fragment might be of use."" (P. 146 of the mass market paperback). It was Pan Am flight 103 that exploded over LockerbIE Scotland on 21 December 1988.Cussler has been writing for too long to let that kind of sloppy detail work make it to the final print copy."
4,pretty good,I am a Clive Cussler fan. I thought this was another pretty good story.I read for entertainment and I got that.
2,"My least favorite ""Cussler"" novel so far",I am a huge fan of Cussler novels and all his series but this one was disappointing. I found the premise interesting and enjoyed many parts of the book but there were just too many coincidences and last second escapes to maintain believability. There was also too much of the villain having to spell out her scheme. Blue Gold is not horrible but definitely not up to Cussler's standards. Since later Kurt Austin novels get better I guess Cussler and Paul Kemprecos needed time to get the collaboration fine tuned.
2,Not one of his Better Efforts,"Blue Gold is a really subpar effort by Clive Cussler and his co-writer (or maybe the co-writer is the real author, and Cussler just approved it). At any rate, the story is a confusing jumble of three or four different plot lines stumbling over each other. Let's see, just mix up lost Amazon tribes, white goddesses, evil pharmaceutical company henchmen out to destroy the rain forest, secret flying wing aircraft, and top it off with a plot to control all the world's freshwater. The sum is definitely less than the parts.Very weak writing all the way through. His other NUMA books are better, especially The Plague Ship."
2,blue gold,"Blue Gold was a disappointment. I don't think Cussler wrote a word of this book. His new heroes Austin and Zavala, were only involved in about 10% of the story. The first couple of chapters were o.k. After that it was a very predictable story line. I miss Pitt and Giardino. Although I must say the last couple of Cussler novels have not impressed me that much. I hope Clive Cussler has more to give in the future. Regarding Austin and Zavala. Dump them. I won't buy another Cussler book with those two in it. I want Pitt!"
3,Not what they used to be,"The old world domination theme, but on a credible premise. Sadly the proofreading is not up to snuff. Several grammatical errors and typos slipped through the net, but that's not to detract from a rollicking Cussler yarn."
1,Sorry to See Dirk Pitt and Clive depart,"A sad misrepresentation of a Clive Cussler novel. Gone were the temptations to stay up all night reading of the adventures of Dirk Pitt. Now there seems to be a sad replay of Dirk adventures throught the eyes of ""another"" writer and another bit actor. Quick unexplained actions with little foresight into realism.I am sorry to say that I will not be reading any more Clive Cussler books if this is the shadow that will be forwarded in the next series from the Numa files."
1,where o where is clive cussler,i have read all of the pitt series and have loved everyone of them this new series is a disaster i know cussler can't live forever but better to go out with a successful pitt series than to settle for this new series which lacks all the real numa players
3,Blue Gold- TOO Simplistic,"The story line is good but the manner in which it is written is simplistic and predictable. Where is the suspence that would make this a page turner, and where is the keep them guessing plot twists ? Everything is predictable from the 3rd chapter onward. I have read 5 of these novels and all rate the same review. Will not waste my time on future readings."
4,Look what's back in PRINT!,"I can't give this 5 stars for 1 reason. Only 6 tracks after being shorted on the Road Warrior score too. I too think that ONE OF THE LIVING is a great song; one of my all time favorites. If you recall the video on MTV, Tina ""played"" the electric guitar. The song is nearly an anthem. It's also very sexy. Glad to see they brought this one back."
2,ONE OF THE LIVING SINGLE,"I purchased this album specifically for the song ""One of the Living"". After listening to the track I found that this song on the album differs from the one played in the movie. I was extremely disappointed. The song was flat and slower than the movie version and Tina dosn't hit the high notes as she does in the movie version song. Anyone looking to buy this album just for the track ""One of the Living"" (her greatest recording in my opinion), should not bother if you are looking for the movie version."
5,EXCELLENT THROUGHOUT,"This will be a wonderful addition to your library if you're interested in the classic rockers and pop stars of the 50's and 60's. Great overviews of Chuck Berry, Little Richard and the seminal Rock & Roll giants, with personal asides and valuable context.Also covers some influential pop stars of the 60's you seldom read about, such as Lesley Gore. I'd definitely recommend this one!"
5,Excellent! Loved this book!!,This book is a great book for everyone who wants to learn about sex therapy!
1,JUCA,"These people are brain dead forget them! Jafrum Suck's the big one! They say even though I ordred Premium cow hide it's ok for them to send Buffalo, because they are so busy. They can't tell you if you will get cowhide or Buffalo?"
5,This is the leather you are looking for,"This jacket is everything you want, it is durable,warm and looks great. You will king of the hogs when you got this baby on."
2,Good for the money,Dealing with the company was time consuming and difficult. The jacket is good for the price.
4,good jacket,Good jacket for the price. Seems to be well made to hold up for years of use. Very nice looking. Well worth the money.
4,Just had to have it,"I have always wanted one of these's jackets since my brother came home in one in the late 50. So I bought is as a lark. Wife thinks I am crazy, but it is comfortable and warm. I like it."
1,Motorcycle Jacket,I was dissapointed with this jacket. Jacket is too short and the zippers on the pockets broke with very little use. Do not recommend for any tall people and ones who want to use their pockets.
3,"Good basic jacket, wrong size.",This jacket is basic and good. Be careful when ordering though. I ordered a large and was sent a 4XL!!! It was such a quality jacket though that I wound up giving it to my brother who it kind of fits. All in all good value but wrong size. Perhaps they were out of my size? I dont know.
2,Not usually needed,"This item came without instructions. It took me a while to figure out how to attach it to my Garmin Nuvi, and I had to contact Gilsson to find out how to detach it. After contacting them I realized it's meant to be used on the outside of the vehicle. The Gilsson antenna generally adds bother to using the Garmin, and only in a few instances (driving near skyscrapers) does it add any accuracy (which you can measure for yourself using the satellite location screen on your Nuvi). In that circumstance it is minimally helpful."
5,Wonderful,"Beautiful, perfect.. I do wish the face was a little smaller than the strap, but I love it anyhow! Such a great find."
2,Basic Message,"This book puts forth a wonderful lesson for new believers. If you have truly walked with the Lord for a while it won't teach you anything new. And if you are accustomed to authors like Tozer and E.M. Bounds, this book will disappoint. The depth and writing style of ""Enoch Walked with God"" is very elementary. I would recommend it for new believers and youth, but not for those looking for another book to equal men such as Tozer and Bounds. This book is very short, and would make a good Sunday School lesson."
2,Playing thr Hammered Dulcimer in the Irish Tradition,Not for the absolute beginner (like me). Much more helpful once I got the accompanying tape.
3,deBurgh bride,this book did not hold my intrest the way taming the wolf did. it just seemed very long and very hard to follow.
1,A long walk to a dry well,It was slow paced and kind of depressing. I think maybe he should stick to movies.
1,Drivel,I totally agree with the reviewer who remarked that if he had submitted this ridiculousness to Hyperion they would never have published it.That is exactly what I was thinking.
1,"Don't give up your day job, Steve","Would this ""book"" have ever seen the light of day if its author's name weren't Steve Martin? I think not.The tediously flat characters are mere coat hangers on which to hang slim apercus. But they are works of genius compared to the plot -- a nothing of an idea. There was, however, a truly disturbing element to the book: the author's unwitting cruelty about Mirabelle and his general lack of perception and insight made me wonder what kind of sadistic impulses and inner blankness Mr. Martin could possibly be suffering from.I have nothing against Steve Martin as a comic. His middlebrow brand of humor harkens back to an older, simpler time. It's Ovaltine for the masses. But I do resent paying good money for this extremely pretentious, meritless novella.Anyone who praised this book should try reading more frequently."
1,"Quick read, but don't expect anything wonderful from it","This novella confirms my suspicions that a celebrity should stay away from the literary form. This book should have never received the attention it did--the characters are not likeable at all and represent some of the more pathetic qualities of human nature. The story is filled with the worst cliches imaginable. I was looking for a good romance when I picked it up (not my favorite genre, but once in awhile you get in the mood for it)--I'm embarrassed to say this, but a Harlequin Romance would have been a better choice. Steve is a wonderful actor, comedian, screenwriter, etc.--he should stick with the entertainment industry. I read somewhere today that he is coming out with yet another novella--yippee, can't wait. (!)"
2,Shopgirl,"""Shopgirl"" is written by the very well-known comedian Steve Martin. It is a small story about a wallflower-of-a-girl who sells gloves at Nieman Marcus in LA.Shopgirl is only 130 pages long. I finished it on one leg of a long plane ride - and I read pretty slowly. So it's definitely a quick read, which is a plus.However, the writing itself is not impressive. Steve Martin does not have a good flow to his sentences. Also, the story is also very ""blah"" and uninspiring.The complete 180-degree transformation of Jeremy seems highly unrealistic. This guy goes from 26-year-old slob to GQ-gent nearly overnight.If this book did not have ""by Steve Martin"" on it, it would not have been published. I think people are over-praising it because it's written by a famous comedian, not because it's a great book.So while I applaud Steve Martin for trying new things, he really should stick to what he's best at - making movies."
1,Second Worst Book I Ever Read,"I'm not entirely sure what to make of this book. Dialog was seriously lacking. I found it very tiring and tedious reading a book written from the narrator's perspective. What really get's my goat is that I paid $11.95 for this ""special edition"" (i.e., rip off edition) novelette, while in the same shipment from Amazon I happened on a copy of Joseph Conrad's, ""Heart of Darkness"" which I thoroughly enjoyed for the price of $1.50."
3,An Affair to Remember,"I picked up this book out of pure curiosity of Martin's writing adequacy. He didn't disppointed me much..not super impressive but creditable. A simple yet provoking plot about a glove salegirl ... painter Mirabelle's life or I should say going through vital and changing phases of her life. She have 2 men in her life Ray Porter whom twice her age but very sucessful and rich and Jeremy vice versa.Mirabelle's relationships with them are the key element in this entertaining novella. Through her diary happenings,we are be shown how or what going through Mirabelle's or the other's minds. Set in L.A make it more appealing and the colourful characters provide a stepping stone and it's almost ready for a movie. Martin did showed moments of genius through his depiction with ironic expression and quirky events. However,the precipitate conclusion was rather too forthcoming."
3,Did they ran out of money to finish it up?,"Ok, so the first half was pretty good. A little confusing but I got the idea, but then the ending was just so fast. All the sudden she quit her job then the next thing you know he got her own gallery? And it feels like the movie was mainly focused on steve martin and claire danes while the weird jeremy guy just got left out forgotten. Great acting by Claire Danes however. After all it is just Sad, so the Jeremy guy got her advice of ""just do it"" and became what she called ""successful""? switched from a all banged up volkswagen to a hyundai? because he read some wacky book on some bus?and the fact that the old dude just wanted to sleep with her? scratch that both the old guy and the weirdo Just wanted to sleep with her and, huh?? she's that desperate? it's a little disturbing.... very disturbingthe plot just sucks, but i think the actors did a good job acting i guess."
4,MARTIN'S SECOND BEST,Along with Pure Drivel and Cruel Shoes this ranks as Martin's best work. The economy of worse useage here is astounding. Most authors would've taken this subject matter and plot and turned it into some 500 pg opus. Martin instead churns out a fast read novella.I think Martin is one of the great writers of our time. It's hard to beleive this is the guy who used to perform with an arrow through his cranium.If you enjoy this book check out Pure Drivel for more fun.Pure Drivel
3,Surprise,"I am not sure what I was expecting, but not a story like this from Steve Martin. I think it is very well written. I enjoyed the story. I am glad I read it. It is not the best book I ever read, but I would recommend it. It is a quick read and you see another side of Steve Martin, the author."
2,&#65533;As vacuous as an Easter Island of Barbie Dolls.&#65533;,"Couldn't have said it better myself, Steve. This is a disappointing book from the man who brought us The Man with Two Brains, Dead Men don't Wear Plaid, The Jerk, etc. The characters have no point of view of their own, the narrator's - voiced like the wise-guy from My Blue Heaven - is relentlessly snide and smug.The quality of the writing is further marred by a so-so third person, present tense which would have been better presented as simple third person, past tense. And the dreaded `which' was used to the point of tedium in place of some rephrasing to avoid the problem.There is plenty of good humour in Shopgirl, but at the expense of some in-depth writing to have the book be more than a novelty exercise. I would suggest that Steve Martin go read some Nicholson Baker before he attempts another book of this type."
5,"You Go, Steve!","When I saw this on the best seller's list a while ago, I thought, ""wow...Steve Martin's got a BOOK out?"" I had no idea he was a writer. I kept the title on my ""books to read"" list and finally found a library that had it.I settled in to read what turned out to be a fascinating look into the life of a rather boring girl. Initially, anyway. I just knew Mirabelle was doomed. What a surprise and delight to discover she was not! I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Martin's writing style and his use of the English language, similes and metaphors. I laughed out loud several times. Like some reviewers, I would have liked to have the father piece explored in more depth, but I didn't miss it, really.This might be a good movie, huh?"
5,Shop Girl - BEST book ever!,"Steve Martin amazed me . . . not only is he a great actor but a fabulous writer as well!!! Shop Girl recently became my all time favorite book, moving Go Ask Alice by Annonymus to a close second. Why was shop girl so good you ask? Martin writes with a style that is intriguing and makes you want to read more. The book possesses an overwhelming amount of truth about relationships, sex, love, emotion, life, work, depression, etc. that makes it unique. It was a relief to find an author that was not afraid to tell the story how it would happen in REAL life . . . with all the details and vulgar language. But in doing so, Martin explores the most sensitive of topics and then proceeds to say all the things people think but are afraid to share. Shop Girl is simply brillant and a book that everyone needs to read . . . it make a great gift and is a quick read. Steve Martin gets my vote as an author and I give Shop Girl 5 stars!!!"
4,Wonderfully Surprised...,"I had to slightly chuckle to myself when I first purchased this book, thinking of Steve Martin sitting there writing this from a woman's point of view. As I was reading, and after I finished it, I could not believe that a man wrote this. I am currently in a similar situation and could relate to everything Maribelle was going through. I was wonderfully pleased at how Steve Martin managed to capture the many dimensions of the characters. If you have ever been in a 'May-December relatoinship/romance' or are going through one now, I deffinetely recomend reading this book. It puts so many things in perspective."
4,A Very Warm and Charming Read,"Steve Martin has once agian proved his talent in his latest, Shopgirl:A Novella. This book is is wonderful. 'Shopgirl', better known as 28 year old Mirabelle is bored with work, battling depression, and trying to turn a slopy, irresponsible guy into a well mannered, and sensitive man. But, when a man old enough to be her father named Ray Porter enters her life, her tasks are soon put to an end, fore he like so many others is strangly attracted to her, and can't put his finger on why. He gives her the security that she needs, but somehow, something in the end just doesn't add up. Why? As in so many other relationships, they are both forced to search for an answer to this question, and come to live with it. I highly reccomend this book."
1,best part is the title,"I admit I bought Shopgirl on the basis of Steve Martin's celebrity, because of the brilliance he's shown in some of his comedy. But I started to get restless about ten pages in, then forced myself to read it in one sitting. This book is all description, no plot. It suffers from LA hipness (the plunking down of the ""f"" word often enough to remind those of us who are not from Hollywood that we must read this word and read it often in order to be cool) and it never rises above a one-dimensional treatment of any of its dull, flat characters. This is an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" book: lots of praise because of who the author is, not because of what he's really accomplished here."
1,Lackluster,"This book is written in a detached style, often in a passive voice. You never get inside any characters and get to know or care about them. Steve Martin does way more ""telling"" than ""showing"" and you end up feeling like you are reading a summary of a story, not a story itself."
4,Surprisingly good,"This book completely changed my perception of Steve Martin. I guess I was caught up in the 80s when he was the kinda wacky comedian of cyrano de bergerac or whatever other off the wall comedy he was in during the 80s. Who knew he could write. I heard about the movie first, watched it and feel in love with it. As a woman of that age... I really related and couldn't believe that that wacky comedian was able to write a woman so well, to really understand what we really want from men. I decided to read the book and loved it even more. This book was extremely well written, loved it."
5,Really Good,"I loved this book. It is really fast pace and easy to read. Steve Martin is a great story teller. The book, of course, is much better than the movie because Steve Martin goes into the minds and motiovations of the characters. Highly recommended."
3,A Pleasant Surprise,"This book surprised me a little. It was actually a little more enjoyable for me than a better-regarded novel (The Feast of Love) I recently finished as well. Martin's writing is a sort of large vocabulary minimalism. It's underwritten if anything--a pleasant contrast to Baxter's blatant overwriting. And, while it may not be nearly as polished as Baxter's book, it is far more earnest. You can tell Martin isn't trying to impress anyone; he's just writing. That carries weight with me. That said, I probably won't pick up another book of his on my own, I may try him again if something is strongly recommended."
4,Wonderful short story!!!,"Steve Martin is pretty talented writer.I truly enjoyed this novel I could identify with Mirabelle,the lead character, in so many ways.Her dilemna with Ray Porter and how she felt for Jeremy in the very beginning of the story.I also really enjoyed the L.A. lifestyle background as well it gave me more insight of what living in California maybe like for some people.I feel the story was to short I wish it had been longer.Other than that though I thought it was really well written and I am looking forward to Steve Martin's next book."
4,I found a jewel,"So you think you know Steve Martin? And you think he's silly and ridiculous at times. Get set to change your opinion of his talents as being one dimensional.In Shopgirl, the author takes you on a little shopping trip to Neiman-Marcus where you meet the girl at the glove counter. Not exciting enough for you? Well,this little gem of a book will keep you sitiing in your favorite chair until you get to the last page.Our lovely Shopgirl is most complex and will take you along on a journey that will keep you wondering about her character and her dreams for her life.Steve Martin should write more about Shopgirl...does she become Mangergirl, or Ownergirl?"
4,Steve Martin can write some pretty serious stuff!,"When I picked up this book I assumed it would come with the wit and hilarity that follows Steve Martin, I was wrong. I enjoyed this book. I thought he did a great job of getting into the minds of his characters without drowning us in symbolism. May December romances are very common and I thought this came to the true heart of the matter. Enjoy, I know I did."
4,Shopgirl,"Personally I didn't know Steve Martin could write so well. The book was insightful, relateable, playful. Steve Martin is a man of many talents and I quite hero-worship him now. As for the writing style, I'm not sure how else to describe it other than to say that it's masculine. Almost every sentence in the book is very short, to the point, and matter of fact like it's written from a man's point of view. I found it a bit depressing even though it had a (supposedly) happy ending. Yet I found the characters to be very endearing with all their imperfections. They grew on me. If you liked the movie then the book is a definite must."
2,"Love Steve Martin, Indifferent towards this book","I'm glad that I listened to this book on cassette because only Steve Martin's voice reminded me that this was his ""novella"". I love most of Steve Martin's work, but I couldn't figure out what led him to write this piece. The sex is fairly explicit in a way that serves to interpret the experience from the girl's point of view, and I guess that makes it justified. The author does an admirable job of creating a character, but not one worthy of her own brief novel.The story is nothing particularly original: a girl in LA finds herself in relationships with ""the older professional philanderer"" and ""the immature slacker coming-of-age"".I've followed Steve Martin's work from banjo and stand-up, through The Jerk, to Pure Drivel, and if the name wasn't his, I wouldn't know this book was his either."
3,"Quaint but much like David Gilmour's ""How Boys See Girls""","David Gilmour's ""How Boys See Girls"" (1992) is very much like this work by Mr. Martin (older man, younger woman, love, not love, sex, obsession etc.) but much better.After reading Gilmour there's not much more to get out of ""Shopgirl"" as a man. It's a nice continuation of the study of how men see women. Both put into words what most of us experience in our everyday relationships and the quest for something greater.I give this 3 out of 5 simply because I've read this story before in Gilmour's book, so -2 points on originality. Other than that, it's a nice story to read in a couple of hours while enjoying a tasty mocha at your favorite cafe."
3,Sad but Accurate,"I was impressed with Steve Martin's astute observations about the shallowness of life in Beverly Hills. I found myself fascinated by they way he paints his characters...even though the story itself is not the best book you'll read this year, it's attention to the disfunctional detas of these people's lives will rope you in. A quick, entertaining read."
3,This was a take-it or leave-it book!!!,"Don't get me wrong...I love Steve Martin. ""Shopgirl""...well...I won't say I love it because it would be lying. I found it to be an average read. I'm an avid fiction reader and have spent many worthwhile hours reading tasty tidbits. This wasn't a Hostess Twinkie by any means.....more so a little extra cheese on your burger. Mirabelle was an underdeveloped wallflower and her beau, Ray was a sloth. Jeremy was the only person in this book to spark any interest on my part."
2,Not that great,I picked up this book because I like Steve Martin. I think he is smart and funny. This book is neither. I caught myself praying that Mirabelle's doctor would abandon her and cut off her mood-altering drugs which would lead to her grabbing a gun....--but not before she offed Mr. Ray Porter. I wasn't expecting this to be a wild and crazy book. But I was expecting something interesting.
3,Well written but highly contrived,"I am surprised that none of the other reviewers have dwelled on the extremely ammoral tone to this story. I would have thought that would women readers in particular would have objected to a story that features an older man that thinks it is okay to pick up a young woman and buy her lots of things, sleep with her and then dump her like this is some recipe for 50 something successful men. I think this story is contrived not in the sense that men and women don't behave like this, they do, but in the sense that both of the main characters seem too smart for this kind of simplistic scenario."
2,slashmywristsgirl,"I'm writing this several years after I attempted to read Shopgirl. I put it down about 2/3s into the book. I couldn't drudge through it anymore.Well tonight I went out with a group of friends who all wanted to see it, so I said, ""OK."" Can I just say, it's a much better movie than book. Yes, it is still sad to watch the characters desperately try to connect, but I must say, I can wade through that for a couple of hours in a theatre easily vs. spending several evenings living through the tragedies of Ray, Jeremy, and of course the Shopgirl. There are some beautiful things to take from this story and some points that I think most men and women should ponder; I would just recommend catching the flick with a few friends and then talking it over at your local espresso bar."
2,"There's no ""there"" there","I could hardly get through this long short story. The dry, impersonal narrative didn't engage me at all and made me not give a hoot about the cartoonish characters or the story. There was no build-up, no moving forward. It was clinical, sterile writing. I found no humor in the story. If Martin was trying for any kind of pathos, it eluded me. There seems to be the makings of a beginning of a novel here, one that was aborted and published without being finished. An outline or start of a character study for a better novel, maybe. But in and of itself, a weak and uninteresting try. In my humble opinion, this book would not have received any attention if it weren't written by a well-liked celebrity."
3,It fills a space,"This book was sent to me as a ""must"" read. With high expectations, I opened the book and finished it so quickly, I couldn't believe I had actually read it from cover to cover.The writing is brilliant. It flows--keeps the reader interested. As for the story? Yeah, well, okay. I appreciated the character development and could see these people moving and talking; but, I can't say they were people I wanted to know or people I wanted to spend more time with beyond the last page. Once the book was over, it left me with little more than a fond smile for the talent that is Steve Martin. It surprised me. As a writer, he comes off as much DEEPER than as an actor or stand-up. I love the fact that he is so multi-talented.I think this little book fills a certain space. When you have a couple spare hours to check it out, it's worth it. But don't expect a life changing experience.Respectfully submitted by the author of ""I'm Living Your Dream Life."""
2,Disappointed,I've always admired Steve Martin's willingness to take creative risks. His screenplays in particular are very interesting and thought-provoking. That said I'd have to agree that if anyone else had written this book I don't think it would have been published. It's extremely light-weight writing. The characters are 1-dimensional and there isn't a plot to speak of. If you really want to read this book check it out from your local library. I gave him 1 star for attempting to write a novel and a second star for getting it past an editor and into print. Maybe the next book will be better.
