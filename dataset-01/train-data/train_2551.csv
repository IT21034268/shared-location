1,DO NOT BUY THESE,"These are the worst binoculars ive ever used! Very small field of vision. You know they are bad when you cant tell which way is the correct way to look through them! My little 5 year-old brothers reaction:""These are not good!""Bottom line: Spend more money if you dont want toy binoculars!"
3,Good and bad,"Overall, this book is strictly average. Some chapters are great, some are marginal. A significant amount of the content is duplicated in chapters written by other authors. There are many, many typos and some frank errors. Some of the answers to the review questions are wrong, even when cross checked against the text. If you are using this book to study for the PTxe or Repete, this can be very distressing."
1,Don't waste your money here,"I used to purchase diapers and formula from Amazon, however, they no longer have my business. Pampers size 4 Amazon price $35 - Wal-Mart $21. Formula that same thing. If you check your local Target they have the best prices, I have seen Similac Advanced for as low as $16.99 a can. Sorry Amazon but your prices are driving people like me away."
3,What's UP with the prices?,"I have been a committed buyer of pampers from Amazon for quite some time. I have recommeded them to anyone I know that has the need for diapers. But the prices rescently have been climbing to a crazy level. I realize they were to go up last year. But in the span of 8 months, these have gone from 29.99 to now $36.35? Unless you get in on a $30 back deal.. B&M; stores are cheaper with tax.If you go to Pamapers site, they talk about lowering their prices...???Great Diapers, won;t use anything but them, but will start looking elsewhere."
2,What is up with the prices going up on diapers?,I am only giving them 2 stars because the price is no 35.49 a box. Earlier in a review a lady stated that they are the same prince as walmart. That is true now. 35.49 / 156 = .2275(Amazon) with 92 diapers = $0.227 per diaper(Walmart)
4,Good choice for daytime use,"Pampers Diapers are very good. This economy pack is cheap and very good for babies in the day time. For night use, I think, it is better to use Hugges since you don't have to change diaper at midnight. But if the baby is so old that she/he can sleep very well without natural interrupt(I mean, wake up by her/himself)during the whole night, it is OK to use Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers."
5,Sweet time capsule,Perfect transport back in time with a perfect version of MARY POPPINS -- pristine and great sounding on my turntable.
2,Useless,It's totally useless. Don't buy it. It does not work. Find a better item to spend your money. This is totally worthless.
3,Happy Birth Day,For what I received for the price I paid I'm not impressed. I could have went down to the local party store/craft store and purchased a roll of shinny ribbon for a heck of a lot cheaper then this stuff. Waste of money in my mind.
1,Doesn't work,"As others have noted, it works for a day or two but that's it. Similarly, CDs/DVDs hanging from string don't work, either. (At least for peaches, nectarines and plums.)"
1,Bird Tape,Pretty to watch fly in the wind but useless keeping the birds away! I put this tape up along the fence line only to watch the birds land and poop right beside it.
1,Doesn't Work!,"I put this on my balcony railing - along with the Bird-X ultra sonic device. After a couple weeks, the pigeons just perched directly on the Irri-tape and laughed at me. They started a nest right next to the Bird-X device. Now I'm going to try slinkies across the the railing....."
1,Very Disappointed,"I had high hopes that the Irri-Tape would help me win the battle against the 2-3 dozen robins over my red and black raspberries, apples, grapes and peaches. The description of the product was encouraging, but it doesn't work. The robins aren't deterred by the movement, the noise or reflecting light. Don't waste your money. I have tried everything, and the best solution to birds destroying your precious produce is a Daisy BB gun."
1,Bird-x tape,I bought this tape to scare away the crows from my garbage trailer and it doesn't work. They are still coming and ripping every bag open and spreading garbage everywhere. I guess I'll have to resort to using a tarp. Bummer!
1,Ribbon Does Repell,It didn't work at all! The birds ignored the tape and continued to come into the garage. Foil party streamers work better.
4,Woodpecker is gone...,"We had a woodpecker who pecked 6 holes into my eaves. He would come every time my kid's napped so I was really mad because it would echo throughout the house. I got this through Amazon Prime to try to remedy the problem as soon as possible. Well, it just so happens that the day we received it in the mail, it also rained so putting this on our gutters had to wait. The woodpecker was MIA while it rained but he did come back when it stopped. So we put this up and we haven't seem him since. I don't know for sure whether it was the worsening weather or this tape. Regardless, that pain of a bird is gone and I couldn't feel more relieved."
2,Bird tape,It is very pretty and shiny. Birds really seem to life it... from a distance. It does seem to work better than a fake owl. It is durable and easy to use.
4,This tape solved our woodpecker problem,We have had returning woodpeckers marking our home for the past few years. We have repaired and replaced shingles but nothing seemed to deter them. When they returned this spring we used this irritape and they have not returned. It was a good investment.
2,"It worked the first day, then birds paid no attention to it","After the birds figured out there was no threat, they ignored it. Don't waste your money."
1,Ineffective as a bird deterrent,"I tried putting Irri-tape around the yard to scare away the birds who were feasting on my dog's food. It worked for maybe a day then the birds realized it wasn't a threat and started ignoring it.If you're considering getting this to keep birds away from your pet's food, try getting a Bergen Aut-O-Dine instead. That worked beautifully for me.In my opinion, having this tape hanging all around is not only ineffective as a bird deterrent, it looks trashy."
1,bird tape repellent,"This product did not help me at all. I bought it as a back up incase the Bird-B-gone Hawk didn't work. You need to have a place to hang this stuff where the sun will hit it at least 12 hrs of the day and the way my front door and stairs sit I am lucky to have sun for 3 hrs of the day.The tape seems to be a reflector of light so maybe I can use it for something else at night to reflect headlights if I ever go walking after dark, LOL.Or maybe at Christmas on the tree to reflect off the Christmas lights? That might be cool!"
2,Bird tape review.,This item is placed fairly low in the tree. The objective was to keep birds from pooping on my car underneath. It seems to have little effect on birds above it. However with some of the tape flapping in the wind the rustling noise it makes may have some effect.
2,"Worked, but not for long","It worked for the first week, but I think the birds got smart and just ignored it. I still have 75% of the roll left."
2,Did not work for me,I bought this to scare away woodpeckers along with several other items. This did not scare them away at all.
3,It works..,But doesnt last too long. Fell apart within a week. Maybe Idaho is just too windy for it ha ha
3,Hard Wood?,"Put this in a brand new Bosch router..Bosch PR20EVSK Colt Palm Grip 5.6 Amp 1-Horsepower Fixed-Base Variable-Speed Router with Edge Guide...turned the variable speed up and down, didn't matter...still smoked out on a 1/2 piece of black walnut. It went straight through some birch I had laying around.....(tested to see if the wood was the problem.....and yes.)I have never had a problem with CMT bits before......but this was my first run with a 1/4 inch router. I was hoping I could get more control with the smaller router...Anyway, I'll try again with a Whiteside bit, if that doesn't work I'll put the little router on a shelf somewhere, and go back to doing what I know works....the three stars....well, I work mostly with hardwoods.....and this combo, the bit in particular.....doesn't really.Update: The Whiteside bit(same scenario, exact same piece of wood) went right through...... quickly and precisely.I don't know if I got a bad CMT bit, or what. I am just saying, this is what happened."
3,Watch out,"Very nice bit, however a word of warning. I ruined a very expensive piece of delrin plastic and and a template, because the factory did not tighten the set-screw on the collar above the bearing and I made a cursory check of it before using it. Guess what folks, it's just barely tight and it came loose and I ended up ruining the workpiece, and the template. I just want to give a head's up, check the setscrew it's 3mm, get a allen key and tighten good before using. It was a COSTLY LESSON FOR ME!"
1,Never again,AT&T had the best coverage in Oklahoma that I have ever had in a phone company. That is the only good thing from them. They charged me and extra ten bucks a month for a service I didn't ask for or want. They (and Verizon) are the most expensive plans. Their customer service blows. They are currently trying to get money for a month of service I never had. I had an iphone for over a year. I love my iphone. I love it. I hate AT&T. I will never return to them. If they were a person I would wish their child was born with Downs. I went to t-mobile with my iphone and paid $30 less a month for the roughly same plan without a contract. That is $660 over a two year contract. I found out AT&T was going to buy T-Mobile and I'm now happily on Virgin. I pay $25 a month. I might move up to the $40 plan. That is still less than half what I would have paid AT&T.
3,Rayearth 2 Rocks,"Faster paced then the first series rayearth 2 just keeps on going. This particuler tape has some awesome scenes in it ,and introduces formally the princesses of Chizeta Tarta and Tatra. Along with Aska of Farhen, the gin, and the giant Sanyun. Umi and Fuu get kidnapped by Chizeta and Farhen. Also Umi has a sword fight with Tarta and Fuu has an archery match with Aska who uses the gin for targets. I would not say its really cool but definately the funny tape of the 2 series. Your sides will be aching so bad by the end you will never laugh again. Get it its so worth it."
5,Magic Knights Rayearth,"Magic Knights Rayearth is definetly one of the best anime I've seen. It has everything in it, girls from another world, mecha(robots), swords, magic, and transformations. Rayearth starts out as three girls (who don't know each other) get transported to another world, that world is Cephiro. They are told by a master mage that they are the legendary magic knights who, unless they deafeat a high priest, and save the princess, they can't go back to thier own world.From there on they embark on thier dangerous journey. Rayearth is one of my favorite anime besides Revolutionary Girl Utena, Sailor Moon, Oh My Goddess, X, and The Mysterious Play. It is a very good anime although it doesn't have much romance in it. I strongly recommend it to all anime lovers."
1,Found in the trash,"Was helping a neighbor work on their house when I found this new iron in their trash. They said it worked perfect for a month so they threw away the box and receipt. One month later it died and went in the trash. I took it home and disassembled it and found all connections were good and it lit up but would not heat. The brains of the unit are in the handle and are encapsulated, so even if I knew enough to test all resistors and diodes and such... I can't get to them. Considering what she paid for this model you can imagine how disappointed she was with this purchase. I have noticed other models that have a much higher rating on here and will suggest she always check Amazon customer reviews before buying anything again. I would not suggest this model considering her experience with it."
1,Don't buy Rowenta,"The cord on my very expensive Rowenta gave out in less than a year and I only iron once a week. When I pick up the iron, the power goes off and I have to jiggle the cord to get it back on. If you do buy a Rowenta, be sure to keep the sales receipt. You'll need it. To get my iron serviced, I have to pack it up, with a photocopy of the receipt, and mail it to someplace in Long Island at my expense and wait two to four weeks for a response. Also, be aware, there is a site on-line where folks have reported Rowentas sparking and even bursting into flames at the place where the cord is attached. Clearly, Rowenta has a design problem and I am probably lucky that my iron hasn't sparked or set itself on fire yet. P.S.: The lady who answered the phone at the consumer service desk was totally indifferent."
2,"Perfect, and Perfectly Awful","I thought this would be a great iron. It works really well. Wonderful amounts of steam, makes quick work of my ironing. Until my clothes suddenly have blotches of brown/rusty colored water on them. Sometimes rusty grit comes out as well. This does not ruin my clothes, as the stain comes out in the wash, but it certainly makes life difficult, and I am never sure what will happen. I find that if I just steam iron an old towel within an inch of its life until the staining stops, the iron is usable... Until the next time. I want to just toss the damn thing, but it sure was expensive.This is not a product made in China, BTW, it was assembled in Germany."
5,Love it.,Great iron! I have had many Rowenta irons in the past and this one is the best. New improved freatures make this iron a breeze. Great steam and rapid heat! A Winner!
2,Leaks,I have had my DX-9800 for about 6 years. I have to turn it up to the cotton setting to iron shirts (not cotton ones). If I want to iron cotton I need to use the linen setting. The temp has never worked properly. Now it leaks and spits out little things when I use the steam. It used to work but didn't last long. I have other Rowenta products and have been happy with them butI would not recommend this iron.
1,"The ""not so perfect"" iron","My wife really looked forward to the arrival of this iron (it was on backordered for 3 weeks). Worked great for 3 months, now it won't even get warm. I wouldn't recommend this product at any price."
5,Best iron out there!,"I have tried many irons, most of which I passed on to my kids because they just didn't do the trick, spit water or soleplate got gunky. The Rowenta Perfect DX9800 is fantastic! I like the weight of it, and the steam penetration is the best out there...makes short work of wrinkles. I love it, wouldn't own any thing else! It's worth the extra money to have a quality iron."
1,Bad Iron,Our iron also started leaking after about six months. This seemsto be a common problem with this iron based on other reviews.
1,Rowenta Irons,I've had 4 or 5 Romenta irons in the past few years and haven't had one yet that didn't need repaired within a year. For some reason the steam valves don't work worth a hoot. I'd never buy another one. Roger Miller
1,Works for a short while then has issues,"I was soo disappointed with this iron. I have had 2 in two years. But I have now given up and gotten a different brand.This iron, when working, works beautifully. It really did cut my ironing time in half, great steam, great glide and got nice and hot. But then, my first iron began leaking terribly. Out the holes, on the sole plate. And ethen came the brown stuff everyone else is talking about. :( I was so disappointed but willing to try again since the store offered an exchange.Second one also worked as well for about 8 months. It too began to leak out the holes but also the sides where the plastic met the sole plate. It even cracked the plastic. Then came the brown stuff.Sadly this one went back too and I got a different brand. it's not as hot but works just fine.I was really disappointed in this product."
1,Disappointing iron at a very high price,"This is the second Rowenta iron I've owned. The first one's burst of steam button broke barely a year after purchase. So I went for the Cadillac of the Rowenta line. It irons OK but leaks like crazy, particularly when the water level approaches the refill line. The self cleaning system seems sort of random, occasionally self cleaning a stain on to a shirt I am ironing. I would not buy the brand again. And the customer service people at Rowenta are like, well, imagine a customer service team run by a German lawyer. Not consumer friendly. The low mark is based on the price/quality ratio. For $25 I'd have given it a ""3"". This is one case where a higher price does not get better quality."
1,DON'T DO IT!,"Take a few minutes to read the 1 and 2 STAR ratings...This product has ISSUES! Worked for a few months and now will regularly and unexpectedly shoot brown, chunky substance onto clothing. It actually shot so aggressively that it marked my carpeting with the brown residue. I have never seen anything like it...DON'T DO IT...DON'T be tempted by higher ratings. This product is pure junk!"
1,This iron stinks!,"I read a review in GQ magazine that convinced me to spend the money for this iron. From day one, it leaked all over my ironing and really wasn't even that effective heat and weight wise. I contacted Rowenta and they told me to send it in for repair. Forget it! I will never buy another Rowenta product. My little Sunbeam iron is back in use. It is a lot hotter and never leaks!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I've had this Rowenta for less than 2 months. It worked great at first; now.. No Steam and it causes wrinkles in the fabric. I purchased this through Amazon.com and I'm very dissatisfied with its' performance. Save your money.. buy a less expensive iron; when it stops working you wouldn't feel so bad throwing it out!
2,leaking already,This iron just like the last Rowenta is leaking. I won't buy another one. I thought Rowenta was the brand to get even though higher priced. I am unpleasantly surprised. It is not worth the money.
1,Don't buy this,"This is my first Rowenta. Though it was way too expensive, I bought this thinking that it'll save time. Its not vastly different from the Sunbeams that you get in WalMart or KMart. Worst part is it spews out brown water every now and then. I couldn't quite figure out what's causing that. This morning it spoiled my white shirt. I have heard good things about Rowenta. But this model is certainly not worth it."
5,steam queen,"I've had several Rowenta irons in the past and loved them all, but the DX-9800 is by far the best. Easy glide, nice steam feature, virtually dripless. I'd recommend this iron to anyone who takes pride in the ""look"" of her clothing."
2,very disappointing,"I purchased the rowenta iron because I had heard they were one of the best irons and I was having a hard time finding an iron that I wanted. I was very disappointed!!! From the beginning it never seemed to get hot enough. I ironed everything on the highest setting. I called Rowenta customer service serveral times (they were not much help and not very friendly). Eventually I returned it at my expense, because it started leaking as well. Now it will not heat up at all and it has only been a year and four or five months since I bought it. I will not be buying another one!! I will go back to my dependable Black & Decker, who has great customer relations, as I learned in the past and I have learned to appreciate that. It always helps to have friendly people to help when you have a problem."
2,Steam... Not that great.,"I have used the the DX-9500 many times from a friend and I really like the steam. So I purchased the newer version, DX-9800, and thought it would be a lot better than the DX-9500. Was a little bit dissapointed. Still using the DX-9800 (Perfect) for many months but this iron does not give as much steam as the other. Plus, I experience some leaking even though I still follow water instructions listed."
5,Everything I expected and more,I've had this iron for a couple of weeks now and am very impressed. It really does live up to its claims and dramatically cuts the time it takes to iron things. The price was a little daunting but I'm glad I bought it. There are numerous small details that have been improved upon that make this superior to any other iron I've seen. I recommend it highly.
2,Too bad,"I LOVE this iron when it works, great steam, nice weight, not bad looking, cuts ironing time considerably. After only 3 months however, it's kaput!! Rowenta needs to either redesign or dump the circuit they use for auto shut off. I've had 3 Rowenta irons and all three went belly up because of this feature. The feature they really need is reliability, especially in this price range. It's my personal opinion this iron should last a freakin lifetime. Anyway, so much for brand loyalty, 3 strikes, they're out for me."
3,Disappointed,"Well, I reviewed many comments on many irons and decided to buy the Rowenta DX-9800. The iron was a replacement for a couple of GE and Black & Decker irons that had seen better days. I thought it would be a great upgrade, but my wife and I are disappointed. We have used it for 4 months and have problems.First: It does leak around the fill top. No matter how careful, or what type of water used, the Spring loaded seal drips water. Now the ironing board is getting rusty...and I just bought a new one!Second: The directions clearly suggest not using distilled water. Unfortunately now the iron spits white crystals, even when using bottle water.Wife is very disappointed.Back to the drawing board...... Any good irons out there?"
1,DX-9800 ANYTHING BUT PERFECT,"This is my first review at Amazon, but I felt compelled to write it so no one else gets ripped off.After reading and reading and reading all the reviews of the different irons out there I finally decided to purchase the ultra-expensive Rowenta perfect.DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.I've had the iron for approximately 6 months and from very early on it started to leak. The spring loaded refill button now leaks all the time. I'm constantly clicking it in and out to try to get a better seal so it will stop leaking. If you don't mind constant leaking on your clothes and ironing board then it is a great iron. It is weighted well, comfortable, heats quickly, and has great steam (when it feels like steaming), but the leaking is just unbearable.I read another review that said they couldn't believe Rowenta ever even tested the design before shipping it and I can't agree with that comment more.Spend your hard earned money elsewhere..."
2,FAR Too Much Author Speculation,"This book arrived in a wake of true-crime thrillers, and was moderate on narrative but weak on facts. Much of the story consisted of author speculations about how it would feel to be injected with curare through your IV drip and how the crimes might have been carried out. If you can find the book for nearly free at some second-hand place or a garage sale, go ahead and read it. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,nice,It works well on regular potatoes. Don't try it on sweet potatoes or yams. Makes nice fresh cut french fries (if you have a fryer).
5,"Works as advertised, Big Bang for your Buck!","Works great for an inexpensive product. I immediately opened the box on arrival and sliced some full size Russets.I did not bother with the suction cup, I just held it with my left hand and operated the lever with my right hand. It quickly and easily sliced the potato.Not sure why they call it 'Jumbo', this device is the size everyone needs since it slices whole potatoes. Also, it comes with 2 cutting blades, one for thin quick frying style fries and one that is for larger thicker fries.Though I am a man, I do not see why an average sized woman of ordinary strength couldn't operate this. Once the initial cut is started, it cuts right through like butter. I can see where a huge potato that is extremely dense might be tough but ordinary russets cut easily.We ate a lot of fries last night and one 'feature' that is cool was the ease of 'adding more fries' with a quick whack on another tater!"
3,"Good fry cutter, but not ""Cut Out"" for the long haul","It works great on potatoes, zucchinni, carrots, etc. etc.But...the larger blade didn't last very long. After about 20 uses (I'm estimating - usually on potatoes or softer) the larger blade broke.For the price, it's a good deal and a good cutter. I'm convinced it's a good choice compared to others in this price range. But it could be better."
3,"CRUIZERS ARE NICER, BUT THESE DO THE JOB.","My wife and I prefer the cruizers. They have the stretchy elastic that give a little more play in the waist. They are a little more expensive though. These are fine, but not as convenient. If $ is an issue, then get these, they will do fine. If convenience is, the the cruizers are the better choice."
1,Defective Diapers,"I purchased these diapers for my twin boys. I normally use Huggies but I thought I could give these a try. One of my babies slept in his diaper the entire night. When he woke up for his diaper change, I discovered that the top of the diaper had split open during the night and he was covered from mid-torso to toes in urine-soaked globs and granules of SILICA. I never would have purchased these diapers if I had known that they contained this substance. I can only imagine what would have happened if he had gotten a glob of this in his mouth. It was so sticky and gummy that I had a difficult time cleaning it off of him. I would not purchase these diapers ever again."
3,Doesn't worth the Cruisers,"If you plan to buy pampers diaper go for the Swaddlers, Cruisers and First Step collection. They fit better and they are far more confortable."
1,Good product- flaky pricing,"These were $32 (174 diapers), but now are $36 and marked clearance! I find it shameful to mark something up and label is clearance.NOTE: The product is good. The one star reflects Amazon's marketing to cheat customers."
1,Your service is terrible,I ordered pampers on january 31 2006 and my daughter till this date has still NOT received those pampers yet. This is extremely upsetting to me. It should not take this long for an item to get to someone you sure did not have a problem taking the money out of my account. You should have had those pampers along time ago. However she is still waiting for them and in the meantime I had to order from somewhere else(which I should have done to begin with but I have not had such a terrible experience like this before. Rest assured I will NEVER order from this website again.A very very dissatisfied customer.Robina L. Shadel
2,Too scented-yuck,"These diapers work fine to prevent leaks, but they have a too much perfume. If it had been stated clearly on the box that they were scented, I would not have purchased them. I don't care for the smell and my baby has sensitive skin, so she doesn't need the added chemicals."
5,Good Diapers,"""Pampers"" are good... no matter what they are..I like their products.They are good but Pampers Cruisers are the best."
1,Deceitful Marketing,The pampers diapers are very good and I use it for my twins. But this one star is for Amazon to have increased the price by more than 3 dollars just like that. Also it has been labeled clearance!!! This same diaper is available at SAMS club for 30 dollars!
3,Problem with leaking,These diapers tend to leak for my 8-month-old boy. I never had a problem with Huggies.
2,works but doesnt,cables plug in and work but glitch in and out while u are playing or watching movies great for the price but not when the cut out for a split sec while u are playing a hard game
1,Bad Color Display,"This worked fine at first. Now it will not display the colors correctly. Sometimes there is more green than any thing else. Sometimes it is black and white. I change my settings, unplugged the cable, and everything else I could think of. I'm going back to my AV cables."
4,component Cable,Works just like it's supposed to. It plugs in where it's supposed to and sends all the right signals. It works.
3,Somewhat noticeable difference,"My graphics for Zelda: The Skyward Sword were not very good, so I thought this would help. It did--to a certain extent. First, if you get this, make sure you change your wii settings from standard 480i to hdtv 480p. Everything looks just a little bit better, it is noticeable at first, but it is not going to suddenly make everything look beautiful. It makes SOME texture issues look better, while others are still really bad. For the price, it may be worth it to you. For me, I could take it or leave it."
2,Update - Cable is going bad after only a few months,"Update: After the owning the cable for only a few months, it is starting to break. Now the Wii goes black sometimes. While researching the issue, I found it is caused by a faulty cable. The cable was cheap and I didn't expect it to last forever but only lasting a few months is pretty poor."
5,High Quality HD Cable,"I had the Wii ever since its launch date and always used the supplied video cables. However, since I started playing my Wii more, I decided to upgrade to the HD video cables to go along with my HD TV.The quality is astounding. When I would move the cursor across the screen (when I was using the supplied cord) it left a horrible trail. Now, the trail is not only gone but the cursor appears to have more detail.I don't have a huge TV (mine's 24 inches) so I'm not sure how it looks on them, but for me it's beautiful and crisp. Makes me wish I bought these back when it launched LOL."
1,very unhappy,"You get what you paid for, it was half the price of a symilar cable at Best Buy, unfortunately the only images you can see on the TV are in black and white. I hope to receive my money back, very poor quality to say the least."
3,Need some common sense to distinguish the audio red with Pr (component red),"The cable works perfectly. However, the audio ""Right"" channel and the Video Pr (Red) have identical connectors (red RCA connector).Using common sense, you have to deduce that the connector next to ""White"" is the audio connector."
5,Can now output 480p to HDTV,"I recommend this product.I was using the standard cable that comes with the Wii to output 480i signal to my 47"" HDTV. Upgraded to this cable and was skeptical about whether the image quality would improve noticeably. It has; the 480p signal is cleaner. And for about $5 including shipping, it was worth it to purchase this cable. Works great."
3,Not so great.,"I was hoping for improved graphics on the Wii with this product, but it only seems to make the screen brighter and maybe the colors a little more vivid. It's pretty hard to notice a difference between these cables and the cables that come with the Wii, but for 7 bucks I can't say that I'm hugely dissapointed."
4,length of cable,i would just like to add that this cable is 6 feet long. or 1.3 meters. never measured it correctly but it is only that length and i put it through the wall to the tv and it almost didn't reach. but i got it. so just hope this helps a future buyer.
3,A bit too short,"The description does not specify the cable length. It turned out to be a bit too short for my liking -- I measured it to be between five and a half feet and six feet.If your TV/Wii setup requires a longer cable, you should beware as this cable will not leave you with much flexibility. The quality of the cable is good and well-made, though."
1,BEWARE,"I ordered this video cable and it seemed to work fine the first time. i noticed that the wires were a bit thin, and that the 'gold' plating on the tipe were more likely spray-paint than gold... but I still used it. The second and third time I played wii with this cable i started noticing wierd things on the screen, and when I went back to the regular RCA cable that came with the WII - the wierdness on the screen went away (lines, fuzz, etc).About the 4th time i used the wii with this cable, the video was completely gone. Dead. emailed the seller and they don't warrant this for more than 30 days, so I'm out $10, and you will be too if you order this. They don't care that they're selling a bad piece of equipment and are clearly still selling it.Save yourself the time and headache and hopefully there is a legitimate component cable on amazon - from another seller!"
3,Great price but not the best cables,The cable are not bad for the price. They do the job but I have a short in the red color that turns everything a grayish color. If you wiggle it it works. Kind of annoying though.
1,Junk,This cable is absolute junk. You get what you pay for. The picture was jagged and distorted for the 45 seconds that it worked.
1,DO not buy,"The cables do not work! They make the games look blurry and it is worst than the regular composite cables. May be because this brand is not good, so do not buy this brand. I know technology and trust me on this one. All i can tell you is to go for a better brand. I have a HD TV with progressive scan, and i know how to operate it, so this is really a bad product"
3,Wii HD Pro Component Cable,"The cable is good, but you don't get the full HD like you may think. It does help when the images are moving quickly, but when there isn't much movement on the screen, there are pixelated edges."
1,Cable is bad,The cable has a bad/broken connection. The video blinks or goes out when jiggling the cable. I did various tests to confirm it is indeed this cable. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Wii component cable - is it worth it?,I have a beautiful HDTV that goes up to 1080i...at no point with our current games could I tell any sort of difference between with the cable and without. Perhaps if there are games with better graphics it might make a difference? With the wii play and a few other simple games that we have there was no difference whatsoever.
4,Works well,"I wanted to get a second location for my Wii System. Instead of unplugging all three Wii cables, including moving the sensor bar, I reasoned that I could get a second Sensor Bar, a second Power Adapter and a second component cable.I bought all three from Amazon: The power adapter and sensor bar came from Yoomall, and the component cable from Mycarringcase.I mention all three of them together as they all needed to work for the Wii to work in its new location. I picked these three after reading the reviews on Amazon in December of 2010. I suggest you do the same now, as things may have changed. At that time, these looked the best to me.They all work fine, so far, after about two months of use. If one should fail, I will update the review. As of now, I am a happy camper, and can now bowl from two different locations in my house!"
3,wii component cable,works just fine but didnt notice any real difference between this and the regular video cable that came with the console.
3,Good but Cheap,"When i got mine i put it on my wii, i then notice a difference, its good, but after a while, on mine, the screen will blink black for a quick second, it does this every so often, and sometimes it would do it alot and it would get real annoying, i would recommend getting a better one then this, but if you don't mind the black blinking, then you should be good"
2,Pretty bad purchase,"I was happy with this product for a good amount of time. The picture was great and it looked all right on my HDTV. However, as the product was a third party item, the cable eventually started to fail about six months after the purchase. The screen kept flickering on and off due to the cable, and I had no choice but to throw it out. It was a pretty cheap price but I now know why that is. Going to stick with official Nintendo products from now on."
5,HD Pro Component Cable for Wii,The cable looks well made and it works great for getting 480p wii graphics on my HDTV. The cable has a good length to it so you can place your wii far away from the TV
4,good if you have an HD tv,This is a great way to get better-quality video out of a Nintendo Wii. Picture is significantly better than a RCA or S-Video connection.
5,Works like it should,Makes my wii connect to my HDTV and display properly. Obviously the Wii is on the low end of HD but at least now I can get my display to show up right and the colors look crisp enough. Cable does everything it says it does.
4,Cables hook up very well but did not notice much difference.,Picked up a couple of TV's for Christmas and ended up with an older model HDTV. Picture on this TV is not nearly what the new TV's have so used the old TV for a dedicated hookup to the Wii. These cables were exactly the cables needed but I did not notice any great improvement in the Wii experience.
4,HD Pro Component Cable for Wii,"Colors are good and vibrant. This was at a really good price. Opened the package, hooked it up and was ready to go. Works well so far."
1,Works for 5 Minutes!,"When the component arrives, I inmediatly plug in onto my WII however after 5 minutes of gaming the screen turns black. The cable was never recognized again. Stay away of this product."
2,You do get what you pay for,"I bought this product because I just got a HDTV, and I thought going to 480p would make the Wii look better, well it really didn't. Some reviewers say the colors look better, and I agree, they are brighter and more vibrant, but it makes 3d elements look worse. Some said there were jaggies, there are, it makes the Wii look worse, not better, you'd be better off with the AV cables if you have an HDTV. If you need the RGB, the cable is dirt cheap and worth a shot, just don't expect better image quality."
2,Flawed Design,Unfortunately these are flawed. They have a strong binding neck the prevents the user from pulling back the wires so that the video and audio can be stretched apart. This is a problem since many setups have an audio receiver and a tv input more the just a foot apart.
3,it worked,it was cheap and it worked overall i think it was not necessary but i did it anyways...yeah!vfb fbv ggbr b regrbfre
1,Horrible,"This was an absolute waste of money! Not only is there no difference from the standard component cable but, the picture was actually worse. This cable claims to be HD; up convert your Wii to 480p, NOT! Don't waste your money."
1,Don't Buy This,You get what you pay for with this cable. The audio continually cuts in and out. Video's also cut out on me several times after slightly adjusting the Wii's position. Connection to the Wii is very loose. Steer clear of this one.
3,ok,"It's an ok cable for your wii. i didn't see the clarity and color difference that i noticed with a different component cable on ps2. Looks like the quality of this cable could have been better. It doesn't fit tight on the connectors on my tv, even though the other component cable that i use with ps2 fits perfectly fine. I should have looked around for alternate component cable for wii."
2,No good,"We thought we had hit the jackpot when we found this at this price but, the picture quality is awful so we don't even use it anymore. Maybe we got a bad one or maybe the quality of the product is just low?"
4,"OK, but doesn't really make a noticeable difference","I had read some of the reviews that said it made a slight but noticeable difference, but don't really see it. Some of my games have problems running in HD and switch back to SD. Overall, I'd say not even worth the low price and free shipping with prime. But it does work."
4,"HD-Component Cables worth the price, when cheap...","I got these cables recently. I figured for a few dollars, it was worth it to see the increase in composite to component cables. The increase was worth this price in my opinion, however, I would be upset had I paid $20-$30-$40 for component cables in general to see only a small increase.Pros:Slight visible increase over stock composite cables in my opinion.Cons:These cables are shorter than the stock ones. They appear to be closer to 4ft maybe instead of the 6ft that the stock ones are.Color is dark grey instead of the Wii White.Overall:Definately a recommended buy for this cheap of a price if you are looking for component cables."
4,Works like a champ,"This cable should have been included with the Wii when I bought it, but it works well on my HDTV."
2,Does this work or do I not know how to use it..,I plugged the cables in the correct places but it shows up in black and white on my HDTV... I don't know if this is a defective item or I am not using it correctly... Do i need to change any settings on my tv? if someone can answer this and it works I will give 5 stars until then I'm going with 2 stars..
1,Junk Cables,"Did not work. Do not buy them. Wanted to save money so I paid the 3.99 for these. Plugged them in, nope- very stat-icky picture and sound. Not worth sending back since they were less than the cost of a Happy Meal."
2,"Bad cable, good return process","I received the cable very quickly. When I got around to connecting it, the picture was very faded and there was a very loud humming noise coming from the speakers. I connected my old cable back and the issue was gone. Requested a refund and shipping is prepaid. Bad cable. Good return process"
1,Failed,"I bought this on March 17th 2011 and around Christmas 2011 it had failed. My reason for purchase was that I had bought a new TV that had limited A/V inputs. I had 2 unused component inputs so I thought this would be a good way to connect the Wii without disconnnecting the DVD. The picture is no better than what the A/V cord can handle but that wasn't the reason I bought it. Sometime around Christmas the right audio cable failed and the color turned blue/green. I disconnected the cord, threw it away, and won't buy another. Garbage"
1,Faults: Day 1,"The moment I opened this product and plugged it into the back of my 40"" LCD television, it began transmitting the signal from my Wii in black and white. After gently wiggling the prongs in their sockets (like that was going to help), the signal stopped transmitting entirely.I must admit, after this the cable went immediately into the garbage and I did no further troubleshooting. True, this cable is only the price of a cheap sandwich or milkshake, and I genuinely believe that the 5-star reviewers' cables worked (for a while at least), but is it really worth the risk? You can decide for yourself.I don't want to be the jerk that immediately 1-stars a product that doesn't work right, but in my opinion the fact that it transmitted at all still does not warrant the bump up to a 2-star."
2,"It works, halfway.",It loses some picture quality and it's such a low-quality cable often the part plugged into the back of the wii needs adjusted or you will have a discolored screen and a buzzing noise.I would get a better one of I were you.
3,HD Pro Component Cable for Wii,"The good:_I plugged it in and it worked.The bad:_The cable I received was not the cable pictured, and looked much cheaper and less durable._The cable length is not specified in the product info. Sure, if I looked harder I could have probably located that info, but when buying something that's price is usually linked directly to the length of the product, it should be readily available._You won't notice a big difference in quality. (I use a Samsung LN46D550 1080p 46"" LCD) I would consider myself fairly savvy with HDTV settings and have owned almost every major brand of HDTV and most game consoles since the Sega Genesis, and I just didn't notice a big difference.Overall, I would recommend it simply because any incremental improvement in picture quality is worth $5 to me. What else can you do with $5 these days anyway?"
5,Excellent value,These work great! Don't waste your money on an expensive version of the same thing. Don't be duped into thinking that paying more equals better quality.
5,"Good product, great price","I'm not a huge videophile. The main reason I bought this is because I take my Wii over to friends and family homes all the time and I wanted an extra hookup. So this stays hooked up to my Sharp Aquos and I take the standard AV cord when I travel. Works great, picture looks great. No complaints."
4,A big step up from the original Wii cable on my HD TV,This generic component cable provides a nice upgrade from the original A/V cable the Wii came with at a reasonable price. I know Monster and others make these cables with better quality but I'm not sure they would be 10 or even 25 times better and yet they are that much more expensive. This cable set was definately worth the money!
3,I don't notice a thing - And it stopped working after 1 month,"Very quickly,I got it because i thought it would make a difference. It really doesn't. It stopped working a week ago so i went back to the orginal"
4,Wii HD Cable,"Never used the Wii without HD cable so I can't give a honest comparison, But my picture is crisp and clear."
1,Horrible quality. Buzzing sound,"Very cheap cable and I was hoping that I will not experience the same as other reviewers, but unfortunately the cable I got made an annoying buzzing sound and the picture quality was bad. I got theComponent AV Cable for Nintendo Wii to HDTVfor a couple of more dollars and it worked perfectly and as expected. Despite the bad quality of the cable, Amazon shipment and return for a refund was excellent."
2,It works....A little better..,"Using this on your WII is like fixing up a car.. Your trying to fix it up, because you really want something better... It does help a little bit, but it doesn't change the fact that you bought a WII, when you should have bought something with better graphics and Gameplay, Join the Club!"
1,Worse quality then included cables,"When I plugged in these so-called HD cables, I noticed a DOWNGRADE in picture quality as compared to the origianal cables packaged with the Wii. I reccomend just using the original cables, as there isn't a big diffrence between 480p and 480i, anyways.EDIT: I believe the problem is the lack of anti-alaising."
1,Wrong Item Sent,"Seller ""New Harbor"" sent the wrong item to me. What I got in the package was an ""AC Adapter for the Nintendo Wii"", NOT the ""Nintendo Wii HD Pro Component Cable"" I've ordered. Sent email to seller but, No reply!"
1,do not buy,"This cable is trash. Just spend the extra money and get something good. I read the reviews before I bought and thought I would still try it. Waste of money. When I hooked up the cable it looked really bad and had a hum. I thought maybe I hooked it up wrong, but I checked several times and was correct. Just don't get it."
5,If you have lots of electronic components...,"I have a DVD, Wii, Roku, and DVR hooked up to the family room TV. To watch a DVD, we'd have to unplug the Wii and vice versa. I got really tired of doing this so I went to Amazon to solve my problem and found this product. I'm sooooo glad I did. Now, every electronic has it's own 'component'. No more messing with wires!"
2,Color distortion,Got this to hook our Wii direct to the tv rather than routing through a vcr. The colors are reversed. It was cheap- so lesson learned. Back to the old connection.
1,Does Not Work,"I tried to hook up this accessory the day I got it in the mail, and first I found that the cord was rather short, so you need your Wii set up close to where you will be hooking it up to. After I plugged in everything, one of the video jacks (I believe it was blue) didn't carry a signal at all, and the left audio cable only carried a weak signal. I tried un-plugging/ re-plugging all of the cables from the TV, and un-plugging/ re-plugging the cable in the Wii, but the cord I received was broken. Even if the cord worked, the length is just too short anyway, and the construction of the cord (the jacks esp.) felt cheap. I would recommend buying a first party product at full price rather than this."
3,Didn't see much of a difference in picture quality,I did not see much of an enhancement in the picture quality and the pixels. My TV also showed it as less than HD quality.
5,"Great cable, not a game!","When I clicked to rate this product, Amazon asked how much fun is this game and how do I rate this game.... HUH?!?This cable works great, it allowed me to connect my Wii into one of the HD inputs on my flat-screen. Believe it or not, it made a big difference in the picture quality during play.If you want to go HD with your Wii, this is a great bargain."
5,"Works, better than analog","Works great, and an excellent value. Even on our standard-def TV, we can really see the improvement from the OEM analog cable and this one."
3,"Decent, but not stellar","I've used this cable on two TVs so far, with the only major difference between the two being the refresh rate (60hz vs 240hz). On the 60hz model, I would occasionally lose the picture briefly, which can spell death in most video games. The signal would flicker, the TV would go black take a few seconds to re-establish the connection, and a total of roughly 3 seconds would pass before anything came back up on the screen. This would happen roughly every 30-45mins. With the newer TV (240hz) this doesn't appear to be occurring, but I haven't had the TV for more than a day. My friends with 60hz TVs and the more expensive cables don't have this problem, so I have to assume the cable is to blame.Basically, it does make the Wii's graphics slightly sharper, but you get what you pay for. Not sure I would recommend buying it to other people if you can afford a more expensive version."
3,OK Cable,"There are certainly better cables available, however this one will get the job done if you're on a budget like me."
1,"HORRIBLE QUALITY, Buyer Beware","The connection went out if i so much as breathed on the cables, the ones i got were really sensitive to the slightest touch. Works if left untouched, but seriously how hard is it to make a cable that can handle movement. Just buy the nintendo ones and save yourself the 5 bucks in the long run, because these are seriously garbage."
4,Good quality product,"These cables seem very durable and well-made. Just keep in mind that the Wii only outputs at 480p, and these cables can't improve the video quality above that. However, black tones seem improved and the rest of the color is a minor improvement. Worth the low price - yes (largely because of the black tones). Also, take notice that the audio cables are bundled with the rest of the cables (as shown in the picture) - I didn't think about the fact if you want to run the audio to a stereo receiver, it can be difficult because of the bundling. Just use extension cables for the audio if you need to run them more than 6"" away from the TV."
1,Doesn't Look As Described! (Dont buy!),"i just got the item today, and when i plug in the cord to the wii, the picture looked horrible! (not as described worse than how it looked on standard cable.) no wonder why its only a few dollers."
4,Good item,Item arrived on time and works as described. There is a noticeable difference in the picture quality but not as dramatic as was expected.
2,Not worth it.,"I got this for my 32inch Sceptre TV after getting a Wii. It didn't work and in fact created lines throughout my t which was very distracting. I assumed it might be my tv brand so tried it on my roommate's 52inch Vizio TV, same results.Save your money and just get something that can convert it to hdmi, this will not do that and there is little if any improvement."
1,"Scan lines, everywhere.",I feel like I'm back in the 80s with this product. The product produces scan lines as if there's some invisible antenna I need to adjust and have someone hold in just the right spot as I play. I wouldn't recommend this product to worst enemy.
1,bad quality,you get what you pay for I guesswire stopped working after a monthno rips or tearsgood thing I only paid 4 dollars
1,Didn't work,"Plugged it in...1. Plugging the green cable shows video but it's in black and white2. Plugging the blue cable makes it lose signal and disconnect3. Setting to 480p causes the screen to split in half and see doubleMy screen is HDTV, but this cable was a waste of money."
3,Problematic,The cable I was sent had a short in it and had to move it to certain positions to get it to display all colors correctly. Will be sending it back for a refund. :-(
1,Junk,Cable worked fine for a few weeks then started having intermittent connection issues. Mostly the red colors would be gone. Wiggle the cable and then it's fine for a few minutes then no red colors again. For the headache and such a minor improvement in quality I went back to the Nintendo composite cable that works perfectly.
5,Nice cable for the price....,"I didn't want to pay $20~30 for a cable and I found this for less than $5, including shipping so I took the chance and ordered them. I didn't have problem with the cables that came with Wii, orginally. I just needed this since I have DVD player and VHS player attatched to my TV that I constantly had to unplug one to play another. With this cable, I don't have to unplug anything which was the main reason buying this. However, I did notice slight improvement in the quality of images. Maybe it's just me but I don't see huge/dramatical improvement. But it's definitely worth money. If you are looking for huge improvement in image quality, maybe you should buy a better cable."
4,does what it says it does!,"it made a noticible difference in the sharpness of my picture, well worth the money!"
3,Not as dramatic a difference as I thought it would be,"I have two HDTVs in my house. One is a large old projection screen and the other is an LCD. I know that the composite cables are not designed for HDTVs and most times look worse than on a SDTV. So I found some component cables and the only real difference between this and the standard cable is that the colors are slightly richer and maybe a few less jaggies. It's hard to notice though if you didn't know I switched the cable in the first place though.Unless you're a videophile, these cables won't be entirely necessary. If you do get them however make sure you have the Wii setup to use them properly (setup 16:9 widescreen display as well as 480p)"
4,Great product,This was a life saver since my TV had component inputs and it looks great in HD. The HD pro component cable is definitely a good buy.
2,Not worth it.,This item got here fast but that's the only good thing about it. I plugged it into my Wii and set the resolution to 480p on the Wii like it needed but every game I played look worse than with the regular A/V cables. Whatever I played had jagged edges or the faces looked really pixelated. Like I was playing an old PS1 game. The cable may have only been 3$ but I wouldn't spend it on this cable again.
3,"Yep, it works.","Does what it needs to do. Not a huge difference from S-Video, but worth it for the price. Great price at $5ish dollars. Thanks."
2,"Fast, but poor quality","We received the order as promised and it came fairly quick, even though we ordered it over a holiday weekend (slower mail). However, upon using them, we realized we got just what we paid for. The color is not good...it has a yellow hue to everything, as if you're wearing yellow-tinted sunglasses. The clarity and sound is fine, and we may be able to get used to the color, but I still notice it after using it 6 or 8 times."
1,Poorly build product; Front page reviews on this product are fake,"Avoid this at all costs. Go and spend the money to get something else. I have tested between 3 different cable sets from this company on and 5 different tv's and on 2 different wii's; with all cables requiring rma's as when plugged in provided horrid old scanning lines over top of the picture both in the wii menus and in games. These scanning lines seemed to resemble the same error you would receive from old radio/antenna waves, which will horridly distract you when playing."
1,"Took a chance, cables failed to improve quality","The reviews on these cables were very mixed, but I wanted my Wii to be HD on my new HDTV and I didn't want to spend a lot of money; thus, I bought these cables. When I plugged them in, the video quality became worse, and after I changed the internal Wii video settings up to 480p, the video was intermittent and sometimes turned off completely until I changed the cables back to the originals. When I bought the cables the price had been slashed from 49.99 to 5.XX, which is somewhat suspicious. It seems that this company probably has a bunch of cables, many of which are faulty, and they're just trying to get rid of them. Amazon let me return them at no cost, however, so I don't feel bad for taking the chance. Next time I'll go with a more trusted brand, such as MadCatz or Nintendo."
1,Does not work/ horrible quality,"I have tried this cord on 2 separate Wii consoles. On one console, the visual component would not register at all, although the audio would. On the second, the visual worked, but there was major interference in the signal causing a grainy image. Would not recommend."
1,Short in the wire,"There was a short in my blue connector, everything stayed green unless I wiggled around the blue one. The difference was barely noticeable anyway."
1,Works well (edit: it doesn't),"The cable arrived in great condition. Works well and did improve the picture noticably, though I did not change the wii settings yet. The text is crisper and sharper. Only thing that showed up a bit grainy were the channels in the wii menu. For $3 it is well worth purchasing. It freed space on the back of my tv where I needed to plug in other stuff. I was not using the component stuff until now, so this was the main advantage for me. I have included a photo of the product. Mine did not come in clear plastic bag as another reviewer had noted. Maybe they got a used one?! Anyway, good purchase.Edit: Only two months later and this cable doesn't work any more. Considering we play the wii once in a blue moon, it is not something we have done. It shows the picture grainy and black and white. It deteriorated gradually, firstly the colors were a little bit off,then a lot, and now plain, old-fashioned black and white. Unfortunately, I will have to throw it away."
4,HD pro component cable for Wii,"after hooking up this cable to my 55"" led tv wow what a noticible difference.. for anyone who has a large tv change the basic Wii cable for this one...you wont be sorry"
1,Do not buy this,"The picture and sound qualaty is really bad, collors are all wrong . Would return this item if I could."
2,"Works, but only kind of.","I don't know if this is just an inconsistency problem among the cables produced (some people seem to have had no problems at all), but I just plugged mine in and tried it out, only to find that the red audio cable generates a loud static-y noise, and reds do not display properly in the video (instead showing as a sort of yellow-ish green). I tried swapping cables here and there, checking the settings on my Wii, and nothing fixed these problems. Simply reverting to the composite cables that came with the console worked fine, so I'm left assuming it's a problem with the cable itself. Sorry, but I can't recommend this one."
2,You get what you pay for,"Hooked my Wii up to my new TV with this cable, and the picture instantly became awful on games! Lines running across the screen, buzzing background noise, etc. It is like watching a 1970s TV with rabbit ears for an antenna and all the ""snow"" and static noise. Terrible. I guess I wasted $10 bucks...and now I'll go back to using the standard RCA cables the Wii came with. :( I learned a lesson too, you get what you pay for. Maybe I should play around with it some more and see what I can get it to do before the hassel of returning it."
4,"Good, but subject to interference","The product works as intended. I can definately tell the difference between the 480p and 480i. The only slight problem with this is the cable is not shielded well and thus subject to interference. In my case I get a 1/2 second black screen every time the air conditioner/heater turns on. Not the end of the world, but it is a bit annoying at times."
3,Still 480i... No visible improvement,All this cable really did for me was allow me to use the Wii on a different input. It was not noticeably clearer. It was not HD. It was still 480i.
2,Cable Has Issues,"I bought this cable because it was cheap (although with shipping and handling the cable is really around $10) and you do get what you pay for in terms of quality. The cable worked alright for the most part, but every so often the picture would cut out and I would be left with a black screen for about 2 sec. Very frustrating during an intense game of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It irritated me enough that I went out and had to buy Nintendo's component cables and I haven't had one problem with them. My advice: put the ten dollars you'd spend on these cables towards durable and quality cables like Nintendos."
2,"Feels poor quality, be careful of short length","The length of this item is not properly advertised. It's less then 5 ft so you have to place your WII near your A/V receiver.The overall quality of the cable feels cheap, but I think you get what you pay for. I'd buy a better cable if I have to."
3,"Works, but low quality","The cable works, but the RCA connectors are poor quality. Usually a female RCA connector will fit snugly over its male counterpart, but the fit on these was very loose. They are a solid circle, without the usual split that allows it to be a little small, but expand when connecting. I had to use a pair of pliers to make a little crimp to get them to fit snugly."
4,Great cable,"I just got the cable, It works like a charm.First you should buy this cable. Then save some money and buy the official one. Buy it now."
3,Cable works well,"RCA connectors are a stiff plastic, so they are not as durable as you might be used to. Other than that, the cable works fine."
4,Overall a good buy,"I purchased this item because the component cable that came with the Wii fell apart. I wanted to move the Wii to the family room where our HDTV is however I needed a cable that would improve the quality of the graphics and this component cable fit the need. Not only did this cable work amazingly, it also came at a good price. At other stores such as Gamestop the price for a cable similar to this was more than 3x the price I paid for this item. Overall this product is a good buy and is a reliable purchase."
1,Terrible Results,"I guess you get what you pay for. When I connected this cable to my TV, the colors of the WII were very muted and distorted. The cable did not clearly display the original colors and made the screen look ugly. It looks like you need to pay a little more for the real thing to get the right results."
1,WII component video cable,I was not impressed with the video quality that this cable gave. I have switched back to the original
1,What is one of the most important pieces of info when your buying a cable?,One of the most important pieces of information when your buying a cable is the LENGTH!!! Hello handhelditems and/or Amazon. List the length! Now I have to buy another dang cable because not only was the length not listed I was in to much of hurry to buy a DIFFERENT cable! Had I not been in a hurry I would not have bought it. There is no length listed!!I say to everyone out there don't buy this. When they wonder why there dang cable isn't selling maybe they'll learn to slow down and display the IMPORTANT information!!
2,As advertised,"Product is good quality, easy install but didn't make much difference in picture quality. Buy it if you must but don't expect hd."
1,Makes no difference,"I couldn't see any difference between this and the original cable. I checked it out for both, playing Wii games (RE4) and watching movies via Netflix and I can't tell any difference...complete waste of money vs. the original cable."
2,What? Cables are NOT a Game. Am I reviewing a game?,"Super cheap cables. Super works super great (super) when you plug them in. (Try it; it's fun) Just be sure you know what you're doing, none of them are labeled."
2,Not HDMI,"Don't order this cable if you're looking for a Wii to HDMI cable. It does not have an HDMI connection on it. I found this cable in the search for Wii and HDMI, and the photos were not close up enough to see that it is not HDMI. Might be a good cable, but not if you're looking for an HDMI one."
1,Broke upon first insertion,"While gently doing the initial hookup, the blue cable's metal piece flat out broke off. Embarassing craftsmanship. Avoid at all costs."
5,it works,"takes from 480i to 480p just like it should! not sure if 480p qualifies as HD but it does it's job. connections fit but could be tighter other than that, it is what it is! showed up in time and does it's job."
1,Don't let the price fool you,This cable worked great for about a week and then the picture started to get really buggy. I made sure it wasn't my Wii or TV. Don't let the price fool you here!
4,Wii Component Cable,The Wii component cable worked just fine and I didn't have to spend a lot of unnecessary extra money for an OEM cable. It made a noticible difference on my HDTV when the Wii display settings were set to the HD mode. The cable is a good value and seems to be of good quality.
3,"Works, thats about it.",Works if you absolutely need a component connection for your Wii. I did not notice much of a difference in picture quality.
5,It Works. Period.,Bought a new Samsung 42C450 Plasma from Sears and switched over our regular cables to the HD cables. Works flawlessly.
4,Works like it should.,"Due to my television's problem of only having one r/b/y connection, I had to purchase a component cable. I feared the price attached. Then I surfed Amazon and up popped this 4 dollar wonder. It works and seems well built. I will buy one again if I ever need to."
3,Thin & Cheap,"Not what I thought I was getting, as I wanted a stronger grade, which I found @ Harbor Freight for about the same price I paid here. Oh well, works for light cable managment..."
1,bad language only needed by untalented,"thanks to the reviewer who warned about the language. Otherwise, I might have bought this DVD. I have heard and used the worst of language over the years but have become disgusted with its use. It's for people with no descriptive language skills. I'll shop for something else. Thanks again."
2,RICH NIXON LITTLE,"I ENJOYED THIS DVD BUT ON THING I DID NOT LIKE WAS SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED, I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID NOT CUT THAT OUT, I DID NOT THINK THAT RICH LITTLE WOULD BE IN SOMETHING THAT WOULD USE THAT LANGUAGE."
3,not good with card holder,"the clip streched after the first time i used it, maybe due to cliping a card hold along with it. So, its good if you used stictly for money alone."
4,titanium money clip,it was exactly what i expected it for my husband. it's lightweight and the size is just right to accommodate his messy bills. the inside part of the clip gets easily scratched though when you close the clip without bills in it. other than that i'm happy happy that i bought this for my hubby.
2,EASILY SCRATCHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,NOT WORTH THE MONEY...THE 1ST DAY I HAD IT IN MY POCKET W/ MY PLASTIC CELL PHONE AND THE CLIP WAS SCRATCHED AND LOOKED 10 YEARS OLD....THIS MUST NOT BE TITANIUM IF PLASTIC CAN SCRATCH IT!
1,"Little clip, Bit price.",This clip is very flimsy. For twenty five bucks I was expecting something stronger and thicker.
2,Disappointed as well...,"I like the strength-to-weight ratio of titanium as well as the texture and look of titanium. So after reading a couple of favorable opinions about this product, I decided to purchase this titanium money-clip.After receiving the money-clip in the mail, I was very disappointed as the first reviewer was (Dec. 31, 2005). Considering the price - $25, I really expected better. Right out of the box, it doesn't look or feel like a high quality item.Looking at the Amazon picture, I expected the money-clip to be considerably larger than what it was in real life. The thinness of the metal makes for a flimsy clip... I was careful not to bend it out of shape, but I think that holding anything more than a couple dollar-bills could easily bend it out of shape.Certainly, considering the price, I am returning this item. I wouldn't recommend this item."
1,"Looked good, but I think it's junk","I wish I'd looked at the full listing before clicking; I'd never have bought it. Check the photo of the back. The closure is just a big curled friction pad that rumples up your money as it closes and adds a *lot* of thickness. I tried to clip a stack of five to ten folded bills about twenty times and couldn't get this clip to leave the bills flat. Even if it didn't rumple up your money, the height of the clip mechanism pretty much defeats the purpose. This is hard to get in and out of a pants pocket.Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't give a dollar for it, let alone the twenty it actually cost. You'd have a better money clip by just pulling a binder clip out of your office junk drawer.My bad for not checking the actual listing, and just going on the ""gold box"" photo."
2,Ehhh,"Money clip looks nice online, but wasnt exactly what I expected when it was received. Sort of a dull color, very light so it easily could and has fallen out of my pocket multiple times.. Almost feel as if im better off not using it.. Shipping was regular. Wouldn't recommend this product to anybody but someone looking to loose their money and money clip together.."
2,"Price vs, Quality","The item is very inexpensively made from stamped metal. The finishing of the clip left sharp corners that are uncomfortable against my leg when the clip is carried in my front trouser pocket, The overall dimensions are too small and make it inconvenient to handle. In summary, the price is too much for what I received and the overall finish is unsatisfactory."
3,Nice clip but...,It looks better in the picture than for real. I thought it would be much larger than it actually is.
2,Very Thin,It doesn't hold many bills at all and scratches easily. Titanium make it seem as though it would hold more than $10 in ones.
3,Money Only clip. No Credit Cards,I was looking for a money clip that would handle credit cards as well. This clip is very small. Can only handle a few bills folded.Titanium Money Clip
1,NOT USABLE,"Returning immediately. I cannot close this money clip with only one credit card. If try any harder it will brake it.Terrible design, ripping off money when closing!Please note this is 2 x 0.75 inch, very small. Titanium is not smooth and is much darker than it appears on the pictures."
1,Titanium Money Clip,"Titanium Money ClipUpon receiving my Titanium money clip, it was initially functioning properly. After less than thirty days; however, the Titanium money clip no longer functions. The clamp (which holds together bills of money) is no longer tight. As a result, my bills fall out of the money clip.I rate this product as insufficient. It does not function as it claims it will.I would not recommend this product to others. Intermittently, I have already bought another money clip (from a different manufacturer) and it functions properly. Given the comparison, this Titanium clip is not worth the money."
1,"Loved it, till it broke!","I owned this item for 1 and 1/2 years. It is great in terms of getting throgh the airport quickly. The little tab that I thought was such a clever design snapped off last night. I don't believe I mistreated the clip, and I am having an issue deciding if I would be willing to spend another 30 bucks on someting that will not last.I hope I have better luck with my next one, but it will not be the same design."
1,do not buy,"Amazon collection offers a 90 day warranty on this piece. That's about all the use you'll get out of it. It is poorly designed, fragile, and _will_ break on you, even if you use it gently like I did. I will never buy from Amazon collection again, as they refused to stand behind their shoddy product. Performed like aluminum of the same thickness. Garbage.*Edit to add* I returned the clip and bought another. It broke even more quickly. This clip is a terrible design, and should never be bought by anyone for any reason. Avoid!I since bought the - Slim Clip Money Clip - Money and Credit Card Holder Wallet and it's great. Although not titanium, it's flat, super durable, works great and seems likely to last forever. It's also less than 1/3 the price. Win!"
3,Lasted a year,"The clip worked really well for about a year, but then it became too loose to hold anything but a large sum of money. Despite this, I did really like it (while it worked) and I am ordering another to replace it."
1,money clip,I am surprised that your company would allow a product as sorry as the money clip I purchased. I thought that your company would know what the product was and I would suggest that check this money clip before you have many dissatistied customer.
3,Simple & Light,"I selected this product over others after searching the web and checking several jewelry stores.I had two primary requirements: lightweight and strong gripping mechanism.This model is constructed of titanium; a strong and extremely lightweight metal. Other materials I saw were steel, silver and gold. All were far too heavy.The gripping mechanism is much better than any other I found. It firmly holds three credit cards and ten bills easily without deforming the metal.I recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple, light, and unassuming money clip."
2,scratches very easily....,"I like the light weight of the money clip. However, I was disappointed with the purchase because...... 1. It scratches very easily just carrying it in your pocket with change or other items. After only a couple of days, it looks very worn and unattractive. 2. A few folded bills will spring the clip. You can squeeze it back into shape, but it's a bit of a pain.Overall, I would not recommend the money clip. I am keeping mine, because it is not worth the hassle or time to return. I'll use it for a while. At least until I find something else more durable."
2,Tears my bills.,"I just got the clip today. I was surprised by how light it was but certainly can live with that. My issue is, that the clip area, when it closes, tears the bills. If I take the time to keep everything inline, which I certainly won't do, it scrunches the bills keeping them from laying flat.I am VERY disappointed."
2,Poor quality hinge,"I purchased this money clip because I love titanium and the fact it's a hinge. However, when I received it, it looked so cheap. Extremely light. Even then, I probably would have kept it but the hinge squeaked every time it opened & closed. Very annoying and proof you get what you pay for. Returned it and spend the money on a very good quality one."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I have to say, when I saw the packaging I was expecting something much better than what I recieved...This is money clip is of very poor quality & not practical at all...I am sending it back, save your money & save yourself the trouble of having to return it."
1,Major Dissapointment,I received as a gift for Christmas.The clip is much smaller than I expected.The open and closing action is not very smoothI will try and return if I can
1,I hate this money clip,"This money clip is the cheapest thing I have ever seen in my life. I can't believe it originally cost $42.oo. I wouldn't have paid more than $5.00 for it if I had seen it first. It is definately not worth the money. It doesn't even look nice. To top it off, I tried to return it to amazon, using the 30 day return policy and go figure... amazon has no record of me ordering this worthless thing. Now I am stuck with a piece of junk. I am not happy. I hate this money clip!"
2,Hinge Failure,I bought one of these here. It lasted about half a year. For the $$ that's not bad I guess .. would have been nice if it had lasted longer.Pin failed in hinge.
3,A gift for my brother,"The service from Amazon was fast. But the gift it self had some blemishes. I know that money clips will get some eventually especially shiny ones like this. However, it really should come flawless. So I wasn't completely satisfied. The design of the clip works great though."
3,small!,it's so small so i can't imagine why it costs so much! not very usefull with this size.will not recommend to others.
1,Broke after 5 months,"The Ti screw that holds the two pieces of the clip together failed where the threads meet the shaft after less than five months of use. Since the threads are stuck in the clip, it's not repairable. It was a nice clip up until it broke: light, and with decent, but not great, ability to securely clip varying amounts of cash."
2,"Looks good, functions not so well.","Looks good, close mechanism functions poorly.The closing mechanism drags on the bills scrunching them up together as it closes."
2,Flimsy,"Too flimsy and cheap looking. Holds money too tight that it tears. When you bend it to accomodate money then it won't bend back to tighten. Not worth it, my fiance' still prefers his Mexico vacation vendor special for $1,"
5,Money Clip,I have for years carried my cash in a money clip. The problem is some are heavy and bulky and have trouble with a heavy wad of bills. When I first received this clip I wondered if it was worth the money but I had paid much more for less.The clip has been perfect for me. I holds tightly large and small amounts of cash. It is the best clip I have ever had and will probably buy another as a back up as I sometimes lose things.
4,Not as strong as you'd think,"You occassionaly have to bend it back to be able to hold fewer bills, but it's a solid, lightweight clip at a good price."
3,It was ok. But it leaves you hanging.,"It was a good ending and all but it was getting a little worried for me. It leaves you hanging again and wondering what will happen next. I really don't like anime that does that. It was a ok ending. The first series was ok too but this should had something more. I write my own comics. I've been doing it for 3 years now. I just started putting them on my computer this week, cause I do have work. But anyways it was a good ending but not not as good as a thought it could be."
2,Battling coins,I think the battling coins are ok.The are not much fun as the cards.If I were you I would buy the trading cards!
4,Ankh review,"Good solid Ankh. The stone does come out eventually, but I think I could have avoided that if I had put a dab of super glue on the edges."
1,Not disastrous but intolerable!,"This is probably the worst rice cooker that I've ever used. It looks great, but it didn't do what it is supposed to do. I find the texture of the steamed rice rather unsatisfying and the result quite inconsistent. Also, you need to leave the readily cooked rice for about 15 mins before you can open the lid. Otherwise, you will get a mess of some sort of crust forming at the bottom of the cooker. This is probably due to the sudden change in temperature when the lid is opened immediately. So, if you want to get a good cooker, I'll recommend you to get one from China town. Get a rice cooker with a Japanese or Chinese brand, guaranteed good result everytime!"
1,Lemon of a cooker,Bought cooker and used it three times -- it smelled like something was burning and quit working!!! I have been trying to get Target or Black and Decker to replace or honor warranty--I haven't heard from either. Buy the Sanyo rice cooker from their website! I gave my 10 year old Sanyo rice cooker to my daughter and she is still using it!!! Good luck if you buy the Black and Decker product!!!
1,"DEFINITELY A ""DON'T BUY""","This machine will boil over with a starchy bubbling mess to clean up - even when cooking the smallest quantity of rice. The vent hole on the top will also get clogged - making it dangerous to lift the lid. DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED. It seems a good value, because it has a large capacity & a removable pan to make clean-up easier - and believe me that's because cleaning up after this machine is a mess. The rice is always soggy on top - with a crust on the bottom. You would be better off using instant rice or cooking it on the stove the old fashioned way - it's less trouble then cleaning up after this machine. I gave it ONE STAR - BECAUSE THAT IS LOWEST YOU CAN GIVE - and that is overrating this machine."
1,This one's out the door!,"We received this rice cooker as a wedding gift. My hubby is a pacific islander and white rice is to every meal as tortillas and beans are to my typical mexican dishes, so we thought great, we have a rice cooker, but when we first tried it, we found that it is not nonstick at all! We tried using more water but that just made the rice taste funny, too much water, then I tried spraying a light coat of Pam, but that doesn't work either. We always clean the starch off the rice, that's the way my husband and his family have always done it, so that's not the problem either. Overall, there is no helping this rice cooker, we'll purchase our next one at one of the local oriental stores or at a restaurant supply store instead. I do not recommend this rice cooker at all! Don't buy it."
2,pretty bad all around,"This is probably my third rice cooker. The other ones either wore out after years of use, or were so small they didn't make enough rice to feed a large family. This one does make a lot, but the quality is only OK at best. As someone else said, you really need to ignore the markings on the inside of the container. Also, my husband used a regular serving spoon to scoop out some rice and destroyed the non-stick surface. You MUST use either a wooden spoon or plastic. I too have found it will cause a ""crust"" to form on the bottom of the rice, but that seems to be better if I unplug the machine as soon as it switches to the warming cycle. All in all, not a great machine."
2,Black and Decker Rice cooker,"This cooker was very disapointing. Left unattended for cooking time (45 min.) it spit pasty rice steam all over the counter, toaster and above cupboards which is hard to get off when dry. Did not matter how much water you put in."
1,Not a good product,"I have purchased this rice cooker twice. The first year it burned out, literally. I purchased another one and the same thing happened this morning, almost a year later.Pros: It is extremely easy to use, easy to clean, and is inexpensive.Cons: Do not use this product under cabinetry. It will cause moisture stains/damage, even if the cabinetry is mounted high. Foam will bubble out of the cooker and onto the counter. The life expectancy of this cooker is only 1 year with moderate to heavy use."
1,Hard to believe this is a Black and Decker product,"I bought this because Black and Decker is a good name, but I was really unhappy when the thing stopped working after a dozen uses. There have to be better rice cookers out there!"
1,I threw it away after 1 use,"I have never used a rice cooker before so I followed the instructions and started cooking 2 cups of rice. I checked on the rice about 1/2 hour later and the water was shooting out of the steam hole and all over my kitchen wall. I thought I did something wrong so I went online and found that the majority of the people who used this machine had the same problem. Also, the glass lid was making nises like it was going to break. I found a person on here that the glass actually broke on. This machine is dangerous and should not be left unattended. If I could give it zero stars I would but the lowest you can go is 1 star."
3,Ignore suggested water lines inside the maker,"My family has been using this rice maker for about year -- I'll admit, it took some experimenting to figure out the correct water to dry rice ratio. After about two batches of soggy rice we decided that the lines for water marked inside the maker were useless.Instead, we use the included plastic measuring cup for everything and ignore the pre-marked suggestions. For every measuring cup of rice we add approx. 2 measuring cups of water. The results have been perfect every time."
4,Works fine,"I'm an experienced rice cooker user. The cooking directions are baloney. You MUST wash the rice, drain, then add twice the amount of water as dry rice - 1 cup dry rice to 2 cups water. Let the pot cool completely before removing leftover rice and hand washing. This will extend the nonstick surface."
2,Works well during its short life,"We bought this one two years ago. It's been working fine for us. We used it almost every day, and we always soaked it in water for hours before we cleaned it. After several month, the non-stick interior gradually lost the coating, but the soaking helped a lot to clean it. Recently it suddenly died. I feel it should last longer. I am looking for another brand now."
3,not a bad product for the price...,"The rice cooker worked great for a few years and then just died one day. It is frustrating but we definitely got a lot of use out of it. I would say for a small investment its a pretty good product. Very easy to use, and the non stick coating was easy to wash. This time around I am going to upgrade and get one that is a little better and will last longer."
4,"Much, much cheaper in region 2","For those of you with region-free DVD players (and to the rest of you what in the world are you waiting for) the complete Sharpe series is available on DVD at amazon's UK site for under $100.Really, that's a saving of almost $200 and the Region 2 DVDs of course are in the technically superior PAL format. So pick up a region free DVD player and the complete Sharpe series on Region 2 DVD and you'll still be spending less than on this one USA set. Plus, the Sharpe DVDs are readily available to ship in less than 24 hours from Amazon UK.These series of movies are amazing. I started watching them on ITV in the UK (correction to previous review: this was NOT a BBC production) and then on A&E; here in the US. The production values are great, the stories/plots exciting and the acting compelling.UPDATE: The price on Amazon UK has been increased. The new price (2/21/05) is $129. Still a great deal cheaper than for the US Region 1 release.."
4,Endless enjoyment!,"Though each episode as titled on the DVD does not ""match"" the content of the novel with the same title, it really does not matter. All the relevant events necessary to make Sharpe's story real come to life on the DVD's. We have already enjoyed watching them twice! I do wish, however, that the map included with the set were of Spain and Portugal so we could have followed Sharpe's adventures (it is of Europe with only a sliver of eastern Spain)! And who can't watch hours of Sean Bean!!??"
1,A Major Disappointment,"I hate to be negative, but I feel I really must warn lovers of the Sharp series about this incredibly disappointing effort. I loved the books, but the series just doesn't measure up. The budgets are very low and look like it. The plots are altered in ways that don't help the story. Sean Bean does a fairly good job job as Sharp, but the rest of the supporting group are either miscast, or ineffective. I am being totally honest when I say I found it so bad that it was difficult to sit through. To be fair, maybe if you'd never read the books you might enjoy it more than I did, but I definately do not recommend buying this without having seen it. I strongly urge you to rent or borrow it first. At least now you've been warned that this series might not match your expectations."
3,Not what I expected,"I was hoping that the buckling connections were more flexible, but I was wrong. To adjust, it's too much work. I returned them and just got the rope ones with the right size I need."
2,Cheap Quality,The scroll is more a cheap toy than a decoration scroll. It is a laser print on cheap paper that arrives with some of the ink peeled off due to being rolled into a scroll. It is not worth the money.
3,Wading Through Dr. Chatty's Worldview,"Dr. Elmer Grossman, a now-retired pediatrician from Berkeley, CA. shares his insights, quips, and ""Grossman's Laws"" for the birkenstock and snugli set. Dr. Grossman may have wanted to be a psychiatrist because that seems to be his passion, in addition to anthropology and cultural norms. Some of his observations are insightful, but at times you'll be tempted to scream ""enough already!"" An energetic editor would have been an asset to rein in his tendency to pontificate. If you want straight facts and crisp details this is not the pediatrics book you'd want in an emergency. On the other hand, if you like to ponder family/child issues, dive right in!"
4,i couldn't stop myself,"This is a very nice book. It's light reading, yet it's deceptively addictive. I wanted to spread out the enjoyment, yet I found myself swallowing the book in huge chunks. I reached the end, bloated on Wil's writing, wishing there were more. More brushes with Shatner. More gentle declarations of love for his family. More descriptions of the author's geeky life.I look forward to his upcoming book ""Just a Geek."" A longer, more in-depth piece of Wil to gorge myself on. Mmmmmm . . . geek."
3,"Great stories, too short","I am a fan of Wil Wheaton's Just A Geek. Dancing Barefoot has the same open honesty and writing style that I enjoyed in that book. The stories are great, and the book itself is very enjoyable.However, my primary complaint is that Dancing Barefoot is too short for the price. It felt like an appendix to Just A Geek instead of a full stand alone book.Still, it is worth reading if you are a fan of Wheaton."
4,Wil is a great writer,"This was a great book. Its a few short stories of Wil's experiences. It really lets you know how he feels about critical moments in his life. After reading this book and went out and got his other one, Just a Geek.The stories are especially good if you are a geek, gamer, browncoat, or trekkie."
5,Dancing Barefoot,"I am an avid reader of WWdN and am a fan of ST:TNG. When I saw that Wil had a book out, I ordered it immediately. What an awesome read! I highly recommend this book to everyone. Great, quick read, fun. Buy this book!"
5,"""Dancing Barefoot"" is a short but sweet read","I still remember Wil Wheaton from his days on Star Trek: The Next Generation (something I'm sure he's only heard a zillion times). You hear such horror stories about child stars who grew up in the spotlight and how it ruined their lives. Wil's book, Dancing Barefoot, is not only a glimpse into some of the turmoils that he's gone through, but also an uplifting book in that we see how he came out on the other side, healthy, happy, and a much better person for it. His writing is engaging, his sense of humor is sharp, and his honesty about himself and the personal growth he's gone through is refreshing.As a precursor to the upcoming book, Just A Geek (from which the five stories in Dancing Barefoot were cut from due to length), reading this book has left me more anxious to read the next all the more.- The WheelMan"
4,"Short, but sweet.","When that great box with the Amazon smiley face on the side arrived, I immediately opened it to find a book that's only the thickness of most magazines. I also so how large the print was on all the pages (they were stretching it out), and I was a little disappointed, until I read it (Which didn't take long at all, of course). The content more than makes up for the size. It's a great book, with some very hilarious (as well as sad) parts. I actually laughed out loud a few times, which rarely happens while I'm reading. Pick it up, it's definantly worth the $10. The first 4 stories are each about 5 pages long, and it's the last story that makes up the book being about 80 pages long."
4,Worth a look if you have an open mind.,"Why shouldn't people say a review isn't helpful if it doesn't tell you anything about the book? Wil may be a liberal, but you won't get that from this book. It doesn't force any opinions on anyone or really offer any opinions for that matter. These are 5 stories of varying length about different times in a person's life. The stories are a quick read. I'd say the first 4 are even worth a second look. The fifth and longest, SpongeBob VegasPants is a little less accessible than the others. If you buy the book and don't like it, pass it on to someone else and share the stories. Writing a review attacking the author and claiming you want to burn the book doesn't help anyone."
5,4 real short stories and one longer one that are all great.,"I bought this book at a book signing in Beaverton Oregon. I have been reading his web site for about a year. Most of these stories were taken from his bloggs but they are before I started reading it. As I sat and waited on him to show (I was extremely early, never been to book signing before) I thought I would just look through the book. Was pulled through the book at an alarming rate. I have always been a fast reader but the book needs to be good too. This book was more than good, it was ubergood. I am a year or two younger than Wil and a lot of the experiences in this book reminded me of my own life. It is the simple things that make life interesting and worth living. When he arrived he read some of the book and it was hilarious. The three initials WFS are burned into my brain. I am looking forward to his next book Just a Geek and think that his writing is just getting better and better. I strongly recommend this book."
5,"Thoughtful, introspective, happy, sad....","These stories really touched me. I grabbed my copy of Dancing Barefoot right before O'Reilly picked up Wil's works for publishing. I have since bough an O'Reilly copy just to complete the set. I loved this book so much. Wil's writing is so accessible. It is as though you're reading a letter from a friend. His website contains more of the same.I am in my 30s and the stories of losing the elders in my family, as Wil lost his Great Aunt, ring very true. The hopeful tone to his stories leaves me feeling much better after having read them.All of this gushing and I didn't even really like the Wesley character as they wrote him on Next Generation.....Wil's that good."
4,Another Paulo Coelho home-run,"Veronika Decides to Die somehow reminds me ofXavier Decides To Stop A Killing, especially in terms of the moral dilemmas discussed in the novel. I've always loved Paulo Coelho ever since I laid eyes on the Alchemist. Overall, 'Veronika...' is a great addition to your Coelho collection."
4,Good decal for the price,"I bought this decal over a year ago for my husband, and it is still nicely applied to the back of his truck ;-) It is starting to peel a little, but I think it is due more to the neighborhood kids (who are Colorado Rockies fan) picking at it, than it does to wear and tear."
3,Bernard Horn is too much the adoring disciple,"After having read four of A.B. Yehoshua's novels, I can state with confidence that he is one of the finest writers around today; however, Mr. Yehoshua's political views are nothing if not controversial and Bernard Horn does the reader a disservice by tossing him one cream puff question after another."
4,A first-rate novelist and very poor thinker,"These interviews are with one of the finest Hebrew language writers working today. Yehoshua is an outstanding storyteller and creator of character.However as a thinker he tends to return to a few fixed ideas, ideas which in some cases are based on ignorance. One of these ideas is that the Jews in the Diaspora had no real creative power or identity of their own. The second is that the Jewish state should help create an Arab state within the total land West of the Jordan, and that while withdrawing all Jews from it the state of Israel should support and encourage the development of a large Arab minority within it. In other words Yehoshua is for a Judenrein Arab state, and a Jewish state which is in good part Arab. And for no Diaspora at all.This book does not probe Yehoshua very deeply. He does talk about his own literature with some insight. But the questions could have been deeper and the book a lot better."
1,False Pretenses,"The Hill Wars Of The Korean Conflict: A Dictionary of Hills, Outposts, and Other Sites of Military ActionWhat a disappointment. Thought I would find at least a few maps. Not so, just sketches which born no relationship of the topographical contours. Lots of technical errors.No space for it on my bookshelf. To say something good about it - it does provide a list of the outposts which might be useful to someone."
1,Doesn't work for a Mac Pro,The cables are two inches too short to use in a Mac Pro - and I discovered this too late to return it.
2,... up game,"This game is really ... up!Don't get me wrong though it's a great football game but it always freezes in the middle of a play which is very frustrating.the graphics are jaged and fuzzy but there good enough to see what your doing.I love the gameplay which I give 5 stars,but it's not good enough to waste my time starting and restarting."
3,Madden NFL 2000 needs G3 w/Voodoo card,"The game plays great on fast machines, but anything shy of a hopped up G3 with a 12 meg Voodoo card and plenty of system RAM is not much fun. Bottom line: With the proper machine the game is a blast. Game tests with slower machines were painful at best."
3,"Good, portable seat","This works great for our small storage space as it folds nicely with tools. However, for some reason I thought all the tools shown in the photo came with it. I was wrong. I guess I'm naive and I thought for the price some of the tools would be included and that it would be great to update my gardening tools and have them match. Anyways, it makes for a good working seat and storage while you are out in the yard."
5,looking desperatly for Jack Cole,I am looking for all kind of information about jack Cole (forgive my bas english)can anyone help me finding this book (and any other document)??????
4,A novel which leads to further reading,"During my reading of Mr. Emerson's Wife, I resolved to read more about the real lives of the characters involved:Lidian Emerson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Historical fiction can sometimes be a little dry or heavy because it is stuffed too full of facts. Not the case here! I found Lidian Emerson to be a very sympathetic character. She marries a famous philosopher who promises her an equal and mutually respectful relationship, but especially after she becomes a mother, he turns his back on her and treats her like a servant. Lidian's relationship with Henry David Thoreau is what I am most curious about. The author stirs up a romance, a very believable romance, about which I very much enjoyed reading, but I'd like to know the facts. Probably she took some liberty, but such is the playground of fiction. I did not want this book to end, and have reserved some related reading for myself. An excellent first novel!"
4,Good!,I really enjoyed this book - thought it was a great representation of the time and characters. How encouraging to see what a woman's life was like in the heady days of transendentalism....but how a mind such a Lydians had to take a back seat once she married. An enjoyable read.
2,uh...,Though these pants look nice - they did not look nice on - material is too thin for my liking.
2,Don't waste your time or money on this one!,"This is probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. To say that it wasn't worth the ten bucks is an understatement. I actually fell asleep trying to watch this thing. I've always been a huge Beatles fan, and I generally buy every video I can find, hoping for something I haven't yet seen, so I own several. This is by far the worst. Even the music in the video is not by the Beatles,and the info is just more of the same. Nothing new here. Do yourself a favor...save your money!"
2,Not worth it,"I've seen many, many unauthorised Beatles docs and this is not the worst. I wish I could say more in it's favor but there is not a lot to recommend it."
1,It's A Loser,"You know you are in for a disappointment when the DVD starts with a disclaimer that the music is not played by the Beatles and that ""the Beatles Group"" does not endorse this DVD. It's a random mismash of presumably public-domain film clips of the Beatles and folks connected with the Beatles. Much of it is overdubbed with some Beatles-like cover band(s) who sound more like The Ruttles or early Spinal Tap, but without the humor. My favorite sequence was a minute or more of Paul McCartney being interviewed by a man with a tape recorder while on an airplane, but with no audible voices, just the overdubbed faux Beatles music. Unless you are a lip reader, that was pretty worthless."
4,Clifford at the Circus,"I loved this book it was so cute how Emily and Clifford helped out at the circus because if they didnt the show wouldnt be able to continue. This book would be good for children 4-8. You could have a kid try to read this book to you when their just starting out, I started out on Clifford and Dr. Suess books when I was learning how to read. This book teaches children to help people out and not just do something for themselves. I wish I had a dog just like Clifford!! Cliffords always doing good things for other people even when he doesnt know them!"
5,Fun book,This book is a lot of fun. My son loves to hear about Clifford and Emily Elizabeth helping when the circus comes to town. As always Clifford saves the day. The pictures are bright and engaging and the book describes many different aspects of the circus. Just wait till you see what happens when Clifford eats all the cotton candy and then gets thirsty. I reccommend buying this book to find out.
3,Not a huge fan,My son likes Clifford. I try to. I find the stories a bit dated and reinforcing of stereotypes. This book is just ok.
5,Too True!!!,"I, like the authors, have been subjected to the guilt that comes with being raised Catholic. I attended Catholic schools from age 3 until I was 13. Thank you for such a good laugh and something I can proudly display on my coffee table!"
1,How did they get this book published? You can have mine for free.,"I read the mixed reviews of this book but decided to try it anyway because of the catchy title. Wrong. I give it a 0 stars. The book was almost embarassing to read - the authors try so hard to be funny and witty but they come across as vapid, silly women trying to make a buck by maligning their own religion. It was awkard, like sitting in front of someone telling bad jokes.I am Episcopal so I do not share the indignation that the Catholic reviewers felt. However, this book was boring, the authors tried to hard and did I say boring?Ms. Anderson needs a new occupation. Wonder what her parents think of this book? And,how did it ever get published?"
2,"errrrh, not really for its intendeed audience","I give it two stars because I like the illustrations, but this is not for young women.Bad mind-body problem Catholic-bashing from within the fold (I think they call those wolves?). Not good for your daughter.Good books are:""Dear Newlyweds"" by Pope Pius XII, for older girls;""The Catholic Girl's Guide"" by Rev. F.X. Lasance remains excellent.His ""Young Man's Guide"" is the counterpart for boys.But in our own time:""Theology of the Body""and ""Love and Responsibility."" By Pope John Paul The Great."
1,Go easy on the book's defenders...,"...after all, most were raised in 1960s and post-1960s America, where morality, religion, and God were taken out of dating and marriage. It doesn't surprise me that they just don't ""get it"" and how offended the rest of us who believe in traditional Catholic morality regarding sex are. I'd wager that most of the book's defenders (and the authors themselves) who think sexual relations within dating is ""how it really is"" haven't bothered to give the Pope's LOVE AND RESPONSIBILITY or THEOLOGY OF THE BODY a read at all. How can you come down on one side of the sexual revolution if you haven't fully explored what you're revolting against?Great to see that the Catholic Church and its teachings are the last beneficiaries of the so-called tolerance these apostles of sexual liberation preach."
5,Laughter Is Indeed the Best Therapy,"Simply put, this book is hilarious! Who knew Catholic girls were so screwed up....But seriously, it's a great tool for being open and honest about sex and sexuality."
1,It's really too bad...,"This book will be most humorous for those raised with strong Catholic values and have since fallen away or at the very least pick and choose what they want to believe is moral. The reality, however, is that you will find the greatest sexual fulfillment within the sacrament of marriage, if you choose to follow church teachings. If you don't believe this then I'm sad to say that joke is truly on you. This is being said from the perspective of a 26 year old male."
1,How Sad,Nice to know that authors who pretend to be Catholic can help bring down their own Church. How very sad is their opinion of youth and feminity. This is the first book that I have read in a long time that I wish I hadn't. Too bad they took the trouble to write it in the first place.
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"Much better resources: ""Real Love: Answers to Your Questions on Dating, Marriage and the Real Meaning of Sex"" by Mary Beth Bonacci; ""If You Really Loved Me: 101 Questions on Dating, Relationships and Sexual Purity"" by Jason Evert; ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" by Joshua Harris; and ""Theology of the Body"" and ""Love and Responsibility,"" both penned by JPII.Enough with the Catholic-bashing already."
5,We love Pokemon Yahtzee,"My 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter love playing the Pokemon Yahtzee game that they received for Christmas. It not only teaches addition and matching skills, it promotes family togetherness. Mom and Dad love playing this game too! This game also teaches the value of cheering other players on and how to be a graceful winner. These are important aspects in life! My son takes this game with him everywhere we go. He takes it to the babysitter, my daughters dance class, and to school. We love this game so much that we are going to buy another one so that we can keep one in the car at all times to take with us everywhere. The game has easy to follow directions and rules that young children can follow. It is so much fun that we play it every night!"
2,OK for occasional use,"I bought this blender about 3 years ago. I used it almost exclusively for making smoothies and other ice-containing drinks. I was always worried it might break because it had a cheap feel to it. Sure enough, eventually the blade just jammed. A replacement blade is backordered. I wish I had spent the money on a more well-built blender in the first place. What attracted me to this one is the fact that the pitcher is plastic and would be less likely to crack."
4,"Good design, great price","The design of the pitcher is well thought-out. The wide base makes it very stable, and the thick, slightly-textured handle is easy to hold on to. The triangular three-position lid (open, closed, and strainer) is a good idea.It does a great job on the three things I use it for: ice, fruit smoothies, and finely-chopped vegetables.Minus one star for not being rated dishwasher-safe."
2,Doesn't do as promised,"The blender promised to have ""ice breaking capabilities"" but it fails horribly. I used medium size ice cubes and this blender just scraped the surface of the ice cubes. If you want to make smoothies, I suggest you aim to spend more money around 50 bucks for a decent blender that can actually crush ice. How much you pay is how much you get!"
3,An okay blender,"This blender is okay,but I`d rather spend a little more for an Oster with more power and all-metal drive.I dont think this Hamilton-Beach would last that long because of its plastic drive parts and inferior motor.Go for an Oster instead."
1,Awful Blender,This is a horrible blender; I tried to make a smoothie and the motor burnt out. My entire kitchen smelt like burnt plastic. This was only my fifth or sixth use of the machine. Needless to say I had to throw it out and I&
1,you get what you pay for!,"After breaking my grandmother's 30 year old blender by accident; I needed another quickly. I found this one and thought it would make do. What a piece of junk. It is put together cheaply, the small plastic piece that covers the top already broke; it can only chop one cube of ice at a time. Buy quality appliances, avoid this one!"
2,learned our blender lesson,"this blender works ok, I guess, so long as you are willing to accept a few things. these include a horrible warm-rubber smell, leaking container, and huge chunks of ice in your margarita. oh, and the not working about a month after purchase. I'm so tired of this blender and it's inferiority that I'm splashing out a little more money to replace it with a better model - from another company."
1,Terrible Blender,"This blender was a huge disappointment. I bought it because it promised to have a special ice-crushing feature, so I could make smoothies and frozen drinks. Well, I attempted to make a smoothie, and the ice was not crushed at all. Not even a little bit. This blender cannot blend, either. I will be returning this junky blender and investing in a better one."
1,Dont Ever buy a Hamilton Beach -Blendewr,"I am so mad today. I also am expecting company and all of a sudden my HM blender has broken down on me. this is the 2nd HM blender i have bought in 1 year. This second one was bought only 5 months ago. I swear i will never ever ever buy any HM product. It is just absolutely useless. I will make sure i tell other housewives after our PTA meeting talks.I cant believe i am having to spend again on a new blender. Just like the other poster suggested, its better ot invest in a better blender even if it will cost $50."
2,worked well & then broke,"The motor on this blender stinks, basically. I used mine every day for a month and then it broke. Possibly good for the occasional blended drink and that's it."
2,just ok,"I bought this blender a year ago, and used it periodically for smoothies and to blend stuff. It did the job ok, it took a while to crush, and leaked oil onto the base. After about, i'd say 25 uses in a year the motor blew up. It smoked and ceased to work. I now have to buy another, but NOT THIS ONE! i'm looking at a different brand and higher price point, hopefully it'll last longer now that I'll be using it much more (making baby food!)"
1,Plastic all the way!,"This blender is all plastic, and feels cheap. Quiet frankly I do not expect it to last very long. I too, had trouble with the ice crushing feature. There were other blenders at Target that would have been a better choice. I should have exchanged it for one of those, before I opened the box. But I did not want to spend much money, and I got what I paid for. Oh well."
2,not as advertised,I bought this under the impression - as stated in your copy - that it had no cut-off switch. It does. Not a happy camper.
4,Pak-lites are pretty good,"I settled for the cheapest model because the premium versions were just way too expensive. I really like it though. I carry it every single day in my pocket and use it 12 times a day inspecting brakes and rotors. If i get money for Christmas, maybe I will order one with a colored top. I think this is a really cool light and the battery seems to never run down."
5,Great light for airplane and home,"I have 3 Pak-lite LED Flashlights. I have had them for years. While flying the Quest Kodiak, I had one with Velcro attached on the power quadrant. Used it many times for wing inspection while flying and for pre and post flight. I have one in my survival kit, duck taped to one of my daughters elastic hair bands (dark green) and used it as a head lamp in the wilderness for aircrew survival class and Wilderness First Responder (WFR) training. I had another (more expensive hi/low light version) in my computer bag that used to travel with me everywhere. Unfortunately I left it in a hotel in Wichita (some lucky house cleaner has it no doubt). Finally, I have one on my nightstand next to the bed, use it nearly daily. Needless to say, I believe in this little light, after 3+ years, most are still on the original battery (I change the battery on the survival light yearly)"
5,small powerful flashlight,Seems to be well madeMade in USAGlows in the dark when offPut it on used smoke detector batteries
4,A handy little flashlight.,"I own a few of these Pak-lite flashlights. This one is the basic version that Pak-lite produces. It has only an on/off switch, but it produces enough light to see things that are at least twenty feet away. This little light is compact and easy to hold. One of the better features of this light is that the housing of the light itself is made out of glow in the dark plastic. After using the light for even a few seconds the whole head will glow for a couple of hours, making it easy to find where you may have dropped it or set it down. Pak-lite does make other flashlights that are very similar to the basic model, which I also own, but I find that this model is the best value and I have bought a few of these for friends and family. These flashlights are ideal for those occasions when space is limited and bright light is needed."
3,Thin Rubber Mats,"Basically a thin rubber floor mat. Fits the floor studs but is not snug in them.I wore a hole in the original carpet driver's-side floor mat and wished only to replace that, as the other three mats were fine. Dealer was not an option - had to buy a whole new set of 4 for $100; didn't want to do that. So I will throw away the new passenger-side mat and use this rubber one. You get what you pay for here, do not consider these to be equal to the original, standard mats that came with my '02 beetle. But they'll do. I expect them to last maybe 20-25K miles."
5,Perfect,"Perfect fit for my 02 beetle. I""m so glad that I didn't have to cut it or bunch it up to fit. It fits the two mat holders at the bottom on both and is not in the way of the gas pedal. Fast delivery. Excellent!!!"
4,Right sizing,"These mats were cute for the VW Bug. The little beetle in the mat were there but didn't show up as much as I wanted. I didn't want some bright red bug but thought these would have been grayish but they were black just like the mat itself is. Also, the mats were very thin. Good for everyday useage if you live where there is pavement everywhere, however, we live on dirt roads and the mats wouldn't have collected the gravel the way we needed. Overall an excellent product, it just did not fit our needs due to where we live."
1,dull horror,"a dull horror with a lot of voice over.I got the movie because I am a tina Krause fan but even she couln't save this one.Basically the plot is about a man who kills women to sacrafice to bring a goddess to life.He meets tina,falls in love and must decide if he is going to kill Tina because the goddess needs a personel sacrafice to be brought to life.Nowhere near as exciting as it sounds.There is some nudity,violent deaths and long stretches of voice over."
2,want to buy something from their website?,"although there was some good skincare advice in the book and i am sure Dr. Kunin is very knowledgeable, it read more like an overgrown commercial for everything they sell on their web-store, which makes me a little less likely to trust the advice. my point is: this may possibly be a very helpful book, but it is my opinion that there are plenty of other very helpful books that aren't trying to sell you what they suggest you buy."
4,An informative skincare encyclopedia!,"I can't give it a five, because she does plug her own products. But having a mini-encyclopedia of skin diseases and conditions is a great thing. I wish I had purchased a book like this a long time ago. I have a dermatologist, but she doesn't take the time to really explain, in plain English, what is happening and why. The Dermadoctor does that for the kind of condition that you might seek help for (acne, eczema, hair loss, psoriasis) and also for somethings that we may not immediately seek help for, such as cellulite, cold sores, chapped lips, hives, and dandruff.This isn't a book to read front-to-back, but if you are into healthy skin, I really think this is a great book to have around the house."
4,The book I've been waiting for!,"As a medical journalist I am always on the lookout for great sources of sound, health information I can pass along to my readers. When I found this book - which was actually quite by accident - I knew I struck gold! It covers the most common (and not so common) skin conditions - which include not only things like wrinkles and fine lines, but also rashes and infections and some very serious problems. This is a reference book every woman should have, particularly mothers - kids get all kinds of skin problems growing up and what you will read in this book could be a real help.Unlike the other reviewers I did not find this book commerical at all, but instead helpful and insightful. Pick it up - it will be money well spent!Colette Bouchez -author of ""Your Perfectly Pampered Menopause'and www.YourMenopause.com"
2,Clever Infomercial,"This book was written with the idea of promoting the author's own product line. Sad, because otherwise it is a well written book backed with a good clinical background. If you can get over her commercial intention it is an ok read."
2,Not as pictured,"Item is not as pictured, not nearly as nice. I sent it back and the company said that they had changed suppliers so the item may have changed. Would not recommend buying until they replace the picture so you have a better idea of what you are actually buying. Also did not come with box as advertised. Customer service was helpful but does not make up for the bad situation I was put in just prior to Christmas. Be careful buying from this seller."
4,easy to use => linux,"An unabashed plug for linux on a server! While Microsoft overwhelmingly dominates the desktop market, on the server side, things are far more contentious. Hunt offers us here his vision of how to use a linux machine for many practical server duties.He starts by explaining how to install linux. Then how to set up accounts for users and, very importantly, how to properly set up a mail server. Email was the first killer app of the internet, and configuring a mail server is probably one of your most important duties. A nice thing as shown by the book is that once you have a mail server running, there is relatively little maintenance. (With the notable exception of performing various antispam techniques.)Other sysadmin duties are then explained. If you have already been a sysadmin for Unix machines, then there should be little difficulty here. The difference between linux and any given Unix version is no greater than between that version and another Unix version."
4,Romans Class Study,We are using this book in our Sunday school class. We have completed three units and are finding it very interesting. This book brings up many questions and a lot of discussion.
3,Pretty Good,"During the Spring of 2006 I assisted someone else in leading an evening Bible Study using this book. We had a very good study, although the chapters were a bit long to go over in one hour sessions. We ended up going late every meeting because we became so involved in discussing the Bible passages and commentary from the book. If you have time for months of studying Romans and people who enjoy it, this is a good book for you. If you are looking for something to cover in 6 months of once a week, one hour sessions, you may want to look for something else. The thoughts are very good, though."
5,Powerful and Real,"This album is nothing but passionate worship songs song from a heart that obviously lives it. I am moved to worship Him each time I play the cd, songs like 'Your love is deep' and 'Go and Find a world' are not just songs of worship but songs of action in living out this life in Christ. If you are looking for some fresh worship tunes then this is the cd for you..."
5,It'll bring you to tears,"I have yet to actually own this cd, but Jami was recently at a Christian Convention that I attended. Her band was awesome, her songs were awesome, the lyrics...they were awesome too. I am gonna be buying this cd, because this is one of the best worship cd's I've heard. And Jami's not all about herself...she gives it up to the Lord...she knows this isn't about her...she told us that she wants us to be able to forget that she's even singing so we can worship the Lord alone. So...without further ado...buy the cd...not only will it bring you to tears, it'll bring you closer to the Lord!"
1,Black and Decker Can opener,"Very difficult to use...should be easier. Price was decent but not value. We may sell at a tag sale soon and buy a more efficient, easier to operate can opener."
1,B&D Really Screwed This One Up!,"I came here specifically to write this review so others would not feel the pain I did. Now, only us lazy folks would go looking for an electric can opener, but that's besides the point. The purpose of this device is to open a can faster and easier than a manual can opener. It is so hard to use this darn thing that I inevitably use my manual one to open the can if it takes me more than 3 attempts. Please don't buy this. Buy a good quality manual can opener."
2,"Easy to clean the blade, but shreds the labels","I like the fact that you can remove the blade to clean it easily. The blade has been sharp enough to open every can, but it's sometimes difficult to get the blade to lock onto the can. It consistently shreds the labels. So I usually remove the label to prevent the paper mess. The little chore of removing each can's label negates the time saving benefit of an electric can opener."
2,"It works, but it has some problems!","I bought one of these can openers in 2002, and it's still working. My best guess is that I've opened more than 1000 cans with it -- maybe 2000. But it has problems. First, as several people have noted, it chews up the paper labels on the outside of cans that have them. Lining up the blade with the top of the can is not always easy. And when I use it to open cans that are filled with liquid all the way to the top, a bit of the liquid always spills out during the opening process. So, overall, I'd rate this B&D can opener as follows: DURABILITY: VERY GOOD, EFFECTIVENESS: GOOD, CONVENIENCE: FAIR, TIDINESS OF OPERATION: POOR. I'll buy a different model next time."
2,Not the best,I trust the Black & Decker name but must say that this particular product is a disappointment. It isn't user friendly. It takes several attempts to get the can hooked and opened and by that time it has shredded the paper label in which some pieces always end up in my food. My advice for you would be to make sure can is cleaned before opening so you don't have a problem if any paper falls back into the can.
1,Your dog will go hungry.....,"This can opener is not easy to use -- difficult to line up the can under the opener blade -- and it absolutely would not open 22oz. cans of dog food (which I open several of daily) no matter what I tried. It did shred the label of the cans that I was able to open with it. The company help line was unable to give me any suggestions that worked. I wrote an online inquiry at Black & Decker's website, and a rep called me promptly. According to the company, there are subtle differences in some can tops & this opener doesn't handle them all. They suggest that their model EC1200 should be able to open the dog food cans. I haven't tried that model as yet."
5,Dummies guide to Perfect cookin!,You can do alot with this thing and if you use the right amount of water it is perfect every time. All vegetables and meat get done really fast. I Love the auto cut off. Food stays hot for a good while after shut off. Potatoes cook fast if you dice them. Flavoring the water works really well with rice. Rice is perfect and very good but not that fast. I don't mind the 45 minutes for Uncle Ben since it cuts off for you. You can combine things as well and its fun to experiment with flavors together.I give steamers for Wedding presents and they go over really well.
3,"Good product, but hard to clean","In terms of performance, there is nothing to complain about this steamer. However, it is quite difficult to clean. I would wash this unit thoroughly after I steam broccolis, but the next time I take it out of the shelf it would smell of stale vegetables. I have since switched to a bamboo steamer, which I find much easier to use."
5,Couldn't do without it!,"I bought one of these used at a thrift store 5 years ago. I don't know how old it was when I bought it, but it has been working great these last 5 years and steams great! I love it for when I'm making other stuff that needs my attention, I can just set the steamer and forget it until the bell dings. I would highly recommend if you like steamed vegetables."
3,Mechanical Problems,"I use the machine every night for steaming vegetables. This is the second unit i have purchased, each seems to last a year or so. Two issues that i have noticed:1. The timer stops working - when cooking food the timer gets jammed up, so then it winds up over cooking your food.2. The machine leaks water all over the countertop. It leaks out of the bottom of the machine most of the water that hasnt evaporated.I've decided to try another brand (Oster) and see how their machine holds up."
2,Great while it lasts,"We loved our steamer. Used it at least one a night. For two years. Tonight, after I'd cut up all our vegetables for a stir fry, lo and behold, we discovered the steamer was dead. Completely dead. Doesn't run. And Black & Decker's attitude is: Oh, you got this as a present? So you can't prove how long you've owned it? Tough luck. You have to buy a new one.That would be fine, IF I HADN'T BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR A YEAR. I have no money for a new steamer. Heck, I can't make my mortgage payments. Black & Decker have forced me to write a bad review about a good item because of their attitude towards backing up their products. They DON'T. And they obviously don't care about customer service.I'll steam my rice on the stove in a pot from now on, thank you very much."
5,Super steamer!,"This steamer is the best! I have had mine for more than five years now and it still steams the most perfect vegetables. It's also very versatile in that it does rice and meats (shrimp is particularly good in this unit). This steamer is so easy to use and clean, and it's so much healthier than the microwave, which removes all the vitamins from your food. Overall I love and highly recommend this steamer!"
5,Hooray for broccoli!,"If you like vegetables, especially steamed vegetables, you really must own this contraption. ANY kind of vegetable works great in this steamer. It's easy to use, easy to clean, fast, and CHEAP. What more could you want? No kitchen is complete without one. I'm not kidding, this thing changed my life."
3,not for rice,"After a series of really bad experiences with rice cookers that died after less than 5 uses, I searched Amazon for something well rated. I bought this item because it was cheap, was a steamer supposedly doubling as a rice cooker, and it was highly rated. I just made my first batch of brown rice the other night and it took TWO HOURS. The recommended time for 1.5 cups was 65 minutes, but when I checked at that time, the rice still looked like soup. I set it for 20 minutes three more times, and the liquid was finally absorbed, but the rice still had a few crunchy spots. I would say not to buy this if you're thinking about using it for rice. I haven't tried the other features yet, but I'm sure it works fine as a steamer."
2,The bottom holder has to be improved.,"I bought this steamer a couple of months ago. The bottom holder is really a problem. It is where the water gets heated, and is connected with the power cord. However, the bottom holder has to be washed as the water is contaminated every time I steam. It's so inconvenient to wash it with the cord on it. Also the plastic heating nob in the holder has already begun to crack and break. Terrible. I really think its design should be improved to solve these problems."
2,3 yr old,Well it lasted 3 years.. the knob is broken so i have to use a screw driver to turn in on...I am going to remove the manual timer so it stays on all the time...
5,Black and Decker Food Steamer,"Black & Decker Food SteamerThis item was a replacement purchase for an older model of the same that I had used for years. I'm well pleased with the improved product, especially the more durable food basket. This is a must item in my kitchen. Thank you."
5,Food Steamer,"I really like this steamer. I use it several times a week for steaming veggies, making hard boiled eggs and steaming fish. It is the perfect size for two to four people. Easy cleanup, simple to use."
5,Everyday,I love this steamer. I use it almost daily. It works great for everything from vegetables to fresh fish and hot dogs. The only thing I recommend you not cook in your steamer is chicken. Steaming chicken tends to make it rubbery and it cooks much quicker with any other method.
3,An okay steamer,"The steamer is alright considering it's low price. I find that the container is hard to clean if I steam chicken in it. Little bits of fat drop off (good!) and get stuck in the holes (not good!) and it's hard to take them out. It may be easier in a dishwasher.The guide is not really that detailed regarding cooking times, etc. There is a sticker on the back which lists some time info. I would expect that a premium category steamer might come with a cook book of some sort, which I would have liked.I thought the flavor center was a good idea but so far it hasn't quite had much of an effect - probably need to experiment with more herbs.There's no way to shut the steamer off before the timer is done short of unplugging it. I've not cooked rice or boiled eggs but considering the long times, I'm not sure I have that much patience. I steamed fish and corn on the cob, both of which turned out excellent."
5,GREAT FOOD STEAMER,I would buy this item again. I have use it for steaming veggies and for cooking different kinds of rice. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.
4,Works fine,I used the steamer to sterilize baby bottles. I do not use the white bottom tray because it traps too much water. I just use the large clear plastic basket and its cover. 10 min in timer works great to sterilize things.
5,Love it love it love it!!!,"I bought this over 5 years ago when my son was ready to eat solids. I just loved the facilities, idea and concept. It was convenient in the sense that i could throw in my veges, turn it on and leave the house knowing my food would be ready when i got back with out the trouble of having to switch it off. I used it until the basked fell apart. Only thing I would like is for them to include a lid to the rice bowl so if I want to store left overs, I dont have to transfer the food into something else. Other than that, its perfect. I am going to buy my second one soon. oh and one more thing, when i make rice in it, everyone just complements me on how great the rice is done, plus eat the rice when its steaming hot out of the pot...yummmmooooo"
5,nice steamer,"This is a good product that I would recommend.I typically used it for steaming vegatables, but it is able to do more including steamed rice. It comes with a small booklet that will help you get started.This is a product that is easy enough that a novice can be up and going in very little time.This will help you have a nicer and easier steamed dish or meal with less hassle that you might have doing it on the stove."
2,why the design change?,"I do like the product but why change the design if it works well the way it was? I dont like the new design and i dont like the spout (i guess you can call it)protuding from the side of the steamer. i havent used it yet and i hope steam doesnt come out of the spout because that is very dangerous, ill cross my fingers."
5,Nice and handy,"Our first steamer. Works great, and makes very tasty veggis. Relatively easy to clean."
4,Read the instructions,"I bought this steamer as a replacement for the one I ruined at my brother's house. I put the water in the wrong place and it burned the motor out. My brother and sister-in-law just can't get by without this steamer. They use it to prepare all kinds of vegetables, frozen or fresh. The vegetables turn out beautifully cooked and appetizing. Just make sure you read the instructions on where to put the water. It only took one mistake to ruin the steamer."
5,A Wonderful Addition to Your Kitchen,"This is the second B&D; steamer I have owned. This one is slightly smaller than the one I left to my roommates.If you have a questioned about how much time or water you should use to steam a certain food item all you need to do is look on the back of the steamer. A detailed menu of steamable nutrients wraps the entire backside. It even lists herbs and spices to add to your meal while steaming.The Black & Decker Food Steamer works seamlessly with the rest of your kitchen appliances. It's quick and quiet.If this is your first steamer, you'll love it. These things are great. You'll steam more food than you think you will."
2,LACKS INSTRUCTIONS,"Steams well, but only very limited timing instructions are in small print on theside of the steamer. Also does not say if to use another dishinside and/or the one provided for rice.CAUTION: Managed to burn outside of two fingers rather badly - handleson the lid are at sides and steam may hit fingers when removinglid."
3,Veggie/Rice Steamer,"This is my 3rd B&D; electric steamer and I've been a little disappointed with it. It takes longer to cook the veggies and brown rice (haven't tried white yet with it).The first model I ever owned did a great job and lasted years. The 2nd model did a good job and didn't last as long. This one isn't starting off too well. Also, the booklet is not as informational as the old one and now I'm sorry I threw the old one away since I assumed the booklets would be the same. It has too many languages and not enough info."
5,The Best Wedding Present We Got,"We recieved this as a wedding gift and were, at first, sure we wouldn't use it but kept it anyway. I finally tried it, and have never looked back!! We use it four or five days a week for everything! It is the perfect size for the two of us. It cleans up easily, most parts go right in the dish washer.I now give them to everyone as presents!!!!"
4,"Great, but a little too small for my needs","I purchased this one because of the separate basket. I was hoping to be able to steam rice and veggies at the same time, but it really doesn't work out well. It is a great steamer if you only want to steam one or the other. The flavor screen is fantastic!"
2,OK at best,"I agree that this is a good book for a fishing newcomer to North or South Carolina. But, if not, then save your money for new tackle as this book probably is not going to give you any information you don't already know. This is almost a basic ""how to"" manual for people who don't know what the local fish are or how to fish for them. The photos look like they were taken in the 60's and 70's and probably were. There are numerous books with better details, photos and information than this one."
3,Long quotes in Middle English,"Good book, but the quotes are not in modern English and it is hard to read and there are lots of them and they are often long, like this sentence ;)"
1,What a STUPID ending!,"This has to be one of the w o r s t books I have ever read- I struggled through most of it, hoping it would pick up. Some parts of the story were mildly entertaining, as when the characters imagined their own deaths. But the author never really seemed to pick up any steam with this story as I hoped he might- I kept waiting for it to get ""good"". It read like a bad slasher book and it seemed like he was just trying too hard. Overwritten, and with a totally unbelievable (and completely stupid) ending, even for a fictitious story. the characters were flat, the only one I ended up caring about was the dog! I felt cheated by having spent my time on this one. I don't think I will bother to read anything else by Mr. clark again- he is highly overrated."
2,not what i expected,"once i reached the end of this book i realized the i skimmed through much of it. the really entertaining parts are of course at the end making the reader suffer through whatever it was that took up 200+ pages. Some of the imagery that the author was trying to portray didn't come aross very well, ""house within a house""?, ""promenade""? i don't know. read at your own risk."
4,John,"I loved this book right to the end , the characters becoming people I cared about which leads me to the only critisim I ahve of the book. The Czech seemed to be someone Clark could have developed more instead of killing her off almost at the beginning, I am sure Fisher should have tried harder to find her than he did but overall a good read. Incidentally I come from Clark's part of the world and his atmospheric description of the wild country of Yorkshire the feeling of remotness remarkable in such a small island brings it all back to me."
2,Pretty Minor Effort,"I read this novel with high hopes, given Simon Clark's strong reputation in the horror genre. Unfortunately, this ""haunted house"" novel wasn't particularly original, and the characterization was quite flat. It reminded me a bit of a b-movie on late-night television.THE TOWER wasn't terrible, and it's certainly readable, but when I was finished I felt like it wasn't worth the time and effort I spent on it. There are much better books out there, by writers such as James Newman, Brian Keene, Richard Laymon, and Jack Ketchum. Unless you're a hardcore horror junkie, my advice is to skip this one."
1,not very usefull,I buy it with the idea to have some new possibilities but there's nothing more than this wheel....forget this tool
4,A good book if you like learning about friends (a 2nd grader's review),"it is great . they are wierd. they shard, drank lemonade,ate candy,played with cars. they find a toad and they got mad.they get mad becouse they can't share a toad!-A.O."
4,"Very good read, with some fascinating insights","Lucidly written exposition with stress on concepts rather than notation manipulation. Dollar auctions, Arrow's theorem, Power indices were especially interesting reading. Probably the best place for a layman to get the dope on Arrow's impossibility theorem. Does get a bit tedious in some spots with some numerical permutations, but on the whole, I recommend it highly."
2,Beautiful beginning but blurred endings,"Beginning chapters are lucid with examples - but towards the end of book, things get rather cloudy - and at the fag end it's almost impossible when the author arrives at the Impossibility Theorem of Kenneth Arrow! Looks like somebody hurried up the author to finsh the book and dash it off to the press!"
5,Great product.,This little antenna performs exactly as advertised. We are able to get all our local radio stations and many distant ones. Every station that we wish to listen to is made available on our home theater system.
3,not the best palmer book ever,"While I collect Diana palmer books, I am the first to admit that she is not infallible, and while this is a good book, it is not up to her usual standards. It starts out promisingly enough, but for some reason the characters don't click. There was more emotion felt when the couple popped up briefly in Ms. Palmer's 'Coltrain's proposal'. Still, no palmer book can ever be considered bad, and I bought it simply to complete my collection."
2,Ho-hum!,"Bought the book based on reading other reviews. Have to say that most of the stories weren't that good and/or interesting. There were 1 or 2 that caught my attention enough to finish the storyline and made me think---- but I really would have preferred it if there had been at least 3-4 more.If this were a cookbook and I had browsed through it in the bookstore first, I would never have bought it.The rule I follow is that there has to be at least 5 recipes I can randomly open the book to that I would like to try out for it to be mine.This failed the test."
4,Fictional Humor Makes Big Comeback!,"I recently read the novel ""Escape From the Dead SuperstarReview"" and am estatic that fictional humor is alive and well in the guise of James Vincent Nix, who is not only a great comic, but a wonderful Life teacher as well.This novel not only takes you through a humorous adventure with its interesting characters (not since ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" have I loved this many strange people!), but it teaches you a valuable spiritual lesson as well - without you even realizing it until after the book has been read and digested. Unlike those spiritual books featured on Oprah that hit you over the head with a message, this book allows you to discover one of Life's most important lessons on your own terms. And it does it in such an enjoyable fashion too!If there is any major problem with the book, it is that it ends so quickly. I just wish we could've explored the secondary characters more indepth. Perhaps this can be done in a sequel?"
1,Even if it looks sturdy...,"Don't buy this case.I bought it for my DS Lite. As the person who reviewed this before me stated, the latch felt funny from the start, and it wouldn't close properly unless you twisted it in a damaging manner.Four days after I bought it, the hinge broke, my DS Lite fell out, and the top screen cracked in half.I complained immensely to the company, and they insisted that it was my fault because I didn't close the latch properly. No duh, the design was so bad that it wouldn't close anyway.Don't buy this case."
4,Case for Nintendo DS,"This is a solid case for the nintendo DS. And for someone who drops things a lot, that is a MUST. The only real downside was that the inside of this thing STUNK for about a month. No worries though, it cleared up. Although it has a space for storing some cartridges, it would be nice to have even more room."
3,Limited Scope,"I expected much more. I was very excited that I had located this discontinued book. But my joy faded when I realized that the contents were mainly the limited collection of the author. She has many nice objects but certainly not enough to entitle the book as collectibles of the 50's and 60's. It should have been called ""My Poodle Collection."""
4,Practical and academic,"Lucas' commentary on Daniel covers succinctly and in easy to read fashion the major issues of this important OT book. The text is well-referenced, clearly written, and holds to a high value of Scripture and rigorous scholarship. Explanation of the text without over easy application. Well worth the investment and reading."
2,Wish it had been better,I reviewed this commentary along with 12 others for a seminary class. Lucas did not fare well in the survey because on too many key interpretive issues he did not provide sufficient discussion of the various options or the rationale for his choice. Welcome exceptions to this were his discussions of the identity of Darius the Mede and Belshazzar the King.
1,Awful,"I do not give this commentary low marks simple because it is moderate at best (I would say liberal). The liberal point of view has been expressed in some very good scolary works by Collins and Goldingay. This commentary, however, is not. I will not go into the layout of the book seeing the other review has already done so. The commentary does not have much on introductory matters. The author rides the fence on authorship and date. He claims both to be compatible with inerrancy (and they are not). Deals with the Hebrew and Aramaic with transliterations. He views the seventy weeks a symbolic not literal years. He fails to Jesus in 3:25, 7:13, and 2:45."
3,"Hint!! If you love this band, you will probably also like Leningrad Cowboys","they are a very similar band, (once performed at MTV-awards)"
2,i do like dbz,i do like dbz. it is just that all the legacys are the same. goku fights the evil person and kills him or dies comes back with the dragon balls and kills him or her. the thing is that death is not a big thing in this because it it is like death dosent happen because they come back when the dragon balls come back. and goku is always fighting nothing new ever happens unless you cusitter him going up another level is somthing new.and also why dontthey just get the dragon balls and wish for the person to die like when he fought buu they could hav wished for buu to die or have his powers taken away
1,16:9 to 4:3,"Why does Funimation make it 4:3 when the movie was oringinally 16:9, it was widescreen when i bought the tape from japan. But the movie is good anyway, i like the part when Goku sucks in the sprit bomb and destroy's #13"
4,Funimation Does it Again!!!,"Wow! Another great movie from the famed anime artist, Akira Toriyama. In this movie Dr. Gero built three other androids underground which come out of their capsules just when everyone was having fun in town. This movie was well put together and crafted, many fans should buy it. It has humor and a lot of action. If you want to see a suspenseful movie of Dragonballz, buy Super Android 13 today!!!"
4,cooler than coolers revenge movie,I had the chance to see it before it was in store i ordered the japenese version it was awesome especially the new androids it is a must buy
4,This is Ok,"I rented this at first and loved it. I bought didn't like it as much. It has a good story and fighting, but it seemed alot shorter than the other DBZ movies( This one is only 45 minutes long and most of the other ones are around an hour). This movie is one of the best( up there with Broly and Cooler) but it could of been longer,"
4,its okay....but cooler's revege is way better!,"see it, but unless your not a die hard fan like me and my brother( or a collector) dont bother buying it."
1,DEFECTIVE Blu-Ray Disc,"Noticed that someone else had a problem with this disc. My problem was a bit different however ... the disc menus and programs move fine, however my discs have NO SOUND. You have to turn your volume all the way to the max to even hear the soundtrack faintly. Will try returning this product for another and leave a followup review when the replacement has been received. At least the 'widescreen' picture quality looks to be OK."
1,Discs defective,"I've gone through 2 different discs of this blu-ray and both have been defective. The menus work just fine, but as soon as you start either movie, it slows down to a snail's pace, taking about 30 seconds to get through just 1 second of the movie. I've watched other blu-ray discs on my player, old and new, and no issues, so it's clearly an issue with the discs. Bummer - really looking forward to seeing these classics on blu-ray!"
1,No audio on either movie,"Like another reviewer, I have purchased two copies of this blu ray, one new and one used. Both have the same problem - no audio. I had to turn it all the way up to hear it faintly. It's definitely the way these discs were manufactured. I don't have this problem with any other disc. I would avoid this release until they put out another copy with the bugs fixed."
5,Two Chevy movies in one package = awesome!,"Funny Farm is a classic Chevy movie. Spies Like Us stars Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd as government spies... could it get any funnier? I definitely recommend both of these movies; so, why not buy them in this 2-for-1 deal? Enjoy!"
4,Dated but solid,"The video was filmed in the mid-1980s, but the information seems reasonable and solid. The basic techniques for laying tile are probably the same now as then, and I expect that your local tile store would be happy to inform you of any newer gadgets or techniques for installing tile in your home. Overall, I was pleased with the video."
5,Not all DVDs are the same!,Verbatim and Memorex have proven to be the best for recording off TiVo. All others have errors or don't record at all.
1,After years of reliabiilty...Verbatum flunks,OK. I've been buying Verbatim for years. They've been rock steady reliable and I've never had a problem that wasn't related to something other than the DVD disks themselves.But recently I purchased 150 DVD's in 3 different sets that I am pretty sure are duds.I know because I had about 20 DVD's left from an old batch that ran through my dvd burner perfectly.Only when I opened the new package did I start to get a 50% rejection rate.And I even switched to another DVD burner just to make sure it wasn't a problem with my DVD burner.Same rejection rate...about 50%I know everyone gives Verbatum high marks for reliability...but I have to think that their quality control has gone downVery disappointed.I called the maker of my DVD burner and he suggested trying TAIYO YUDEN brand.I ordered one more set of Verbatum's. If these turn out to be duds...I'm finished with Verbatum
4,Verbatim RW media,Only used 2 discs so far with good results and considering Verbatims reputation I feel I've got a good product.
3,A Good Read,"It is interesting. Serves it's purpose. I don't think I would have bought it, if I would have seen it first."
5,An Excellent Chess Strategy Tutorial,"Unlike many chess books, this book leads you along as if the author is standing over your shoulder.Rather than provide just a set of positions for you in a random fashion, Ault presents each positionalong with a paragraph or two of commentary containing the lesson he is trying to push across. Thepositions proceed along systematic, progressive themes beginning with simple mates, through endgameplay, then strategic considerations such as pawn play, piece play, and attacks. The last section hasa variety of positions with themes randomly chosen from the preceding discussions. An very instructiveand well-organized tutorial on chess strategy, that has certainly improved my chess understanding andactual play!"
3,Overpriced,"I have an older Pilates machine that came with a videotape and wanted a DVD. This is okay, but expensive for what's on it."
1,Not what I thought!,As I had to buy this from the USA I ended up paying 27 for a twenty minute dvd that is more than basic. The disc itself is scratched to bits and took ages to load. Very disappointed and won't buy any more in this series.
3,Low life for this sucker,"Ok, I must admit I was really excited seeing that this little machine picked up this year old dirt from my carpet, but then the freakin battery died! I thought I could plug it into the wall and keep going, guess again. Personally, I'm a cleaning machine myself so I want to clean for more than 5 minutes at a time. This thing works, but does have the battery power or stamina to keep going with me."
1,got a lemon,I used this Item twice and went to use it a third time only to find that the motor burned up.good Idea but made too cheap
1,junk,I used it twice maybe three times and each time it took hours for the floor to dry The next time i tried to use it the motor was shot.
4,Saved my carpet!,"I think this little machine for the money, serves the purpose. It's cleaned up after my dog, sucked up a can of soda. I think it's well worth the money for anyone who needs a carpet cleaner for those little spills and dog accidents."
2,Think twice...,"When you need it...don't count on it. The battery doesn't stay charged and you can't use it plugged in. Big mistake, but a good lesson learned. Don't buy it, until you try it."
3,Not great for pets,"The only thing we have used this for is to clean up ""accidents"" our small Toy Poodle has had. It seems to work ok, the suction could be a bit more powerful, but it is difficult to keep clean."
4,If you have a house pet this is a MUST!!!,"We have two small dogs and a cat. This is ideal for little accidents, hairballs, and spills. It won't clean a huge spill, but I don't think that is what it was meant for. We use ""Kids & Pets"" brand cleaner (get in nat'l chain discount stores)! This is one of the best 40bucks we've ever spent."
1,A Waste of Money,"This product is a waste of money. It does not hold a charge for very long, doesn't clean that well and is extremely noisy. I used it a few times with poor results. I ended up shelving it, and then ultimately throwing it out..."
1,Not worth the effort,"As others said, this machine only runs for about 5 minutes before needing to be charged again. I really don't find it worth getting it out and set up for 5 minutes worth of cleaning. It is easier, and works just as well, to pour cleaner onto the spot and soak it back up with a towel. You might have to scrub some things -- but this machine doesn't scrub for you anyway. The spray nozzle doesn't work well. Sometimes it sprays and sometimes it doesn't. Also, I dropped it once from waist height onto carpet, and the plastic part you put the water into cracked & now leaks everywhere. I wish I had spent a little more money to get a better quality product."
2,dont' waste your money,Battery does not stay charged unless plugged in all the time and then only has five minutes of power.
1,ONLY FRUSTRATION - DON'T BE TEMPTED!,"This unit constantly leaked dirty solution onto the floor, leaving spots all over the carpet. The battery lasted only a few minutes, the solution cup ran out before a larger mess was cleaned. To top it off, the person who later professionally cleaned the carpet told us we ended up setting some stains into the carpet by using the Bissell and he couldn't remove them. It stopped working entirely after 9 months, and we were so disgusted with it by that time we didn't bother looking into a warranty repair."
2,Poorly Engineered,"I have owned two Bissel spot lifters. In both cases, the spray hose became easily blocked so that the spray became uneven. There is no simple means of cleaning the hose. The AC adapters fail easily. This is a problem since the Bissel must remained plugged when not in use; its batteries cannot hold their charge for long periods of time. It's too bad. While it works, its very convenient, especially for those with cats who cough up hairballs."
1,Dont waste your money!,"When fully charged this cleaner only works for 5-7 minutes and you can not use the cord as an adapter, it only works off the battery. Must use cordless! Very inconvenient! Also, the part that collects the soil/water off of the carpet is a very strange shape. When I used this that compartment got very very dirty and due to the strange shape I can not clean out the compartment except for rinsing. Since I could not clean it out well mold grew in there and now the only option I have is to buy a replacement compartment. Please look for another handheld carpet cleaner as this one is very inconvenient!"
2,Would not recommend this product,This product lasted less than a year. The charge would not last long enough to clean a spot of carpet. Started making a terrible noise. Suction power went down. Now in the dustbin. HOWEVER if you believe that something for $30 should last about a year this is a good buy. It worked very well for the first few months. That is why the two start and not less.
2,Short life,"I bought the spotlifter for cleaning cat messes from carpet. It worked pretty well at first, although the power supply was very limited (about 5 minutes of operating time when fully charged). After a couple of uses, the tank began to leak, and the steaming function became less predictable (sometimes water wouldn't come out when trigger was pressed). After about 20 or 30 uses, the machine is now dead--one day it just produced a burning smell and no longer had any power. I only had this thing for about 8 months before throwing it away."
2,Decent but.......,"If you are expecting to clean anything serious or set in it does work well. It pulled up a red wine stain that I have had for three months and have tried almost every other home cleanser to remove. However, it runs hard, after using it for three hours ( a small hall way, and one spot) the engine started running harder and louder. Needless to say I returned it and bought the Power Brush; and it works like a dream and my back is not sore."
2,used it once,"though it has really good suction for the five minutes, after that you have to wait for 12 hours for a recharge, if someone drops a can of soda on the carpet, you will not be able to clean it up in one charge am returning mine & upgrading to the little green machine."
3,use it all the time,"With a three year old and pets this machine comes in handy. It does a pretty good job of picking up small spots and stains. My main complaint is that the battery life is short, very short. I charged it two days befor using it the first time, and now it is always plugged in and the machine lasts for about five minutes. Also, plugging it in while using the machine does not help, so after your five minutes, you have to wait acouple hours to finish. This usually leaves me to scrubbing out stains myself."
3,short battery-life,"It is a handy machine unless you need a deep-down cleaning... perfect for little spots... power does not last long, but works well for things that can be cleaned in 5 minutes or so... If you expect a powerful suction, and a spinning brush, this is not your bet! Go for a big steam-cleaner. If you have a cat like me and need small spot treatments, this one is very handy!"
1,Not worth the $30,"The unit leaked when hung on the wall. The front end cracked and the scrubber broke off within 2 months. Unit only lasted 4-5 minutes, even on full charge."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We bought this product when we got a new kitten who kept having accidents. At first I thought it was the best thing, but after using it twice, I am ready to throw it away and try something else. First of all, you have to charge it for 24 hours, to have 5 minutes of use. Second, the little cup that holds the solution is tiny and doesn't hold enough solution to clean a stain any bigger than my hand. I am constantly refilling the cup, and while that is happening the battery is dying and there's no suction left. When I was reading about this product online, it said it was supposed to come with a scrubbing brush, but mine didn't. It also constantly leaks from everywhere! The solution leaks out, whatever I'm cleaning up leaks out... I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. Trust me, spring for a better one, because this one is just throwing your money away."
3,Kinda Cool,"I bought this little machine for a fair price, I expect it to do a fair job. Well, it cleans just as well as a big model, but it has an awful leak! The dirty water reservoir leaks to the back (toward the working parts) and causes some dirty water to spray out the from exhaust openings. It is fine as long as you do not turn the machine upside down. I use the heck out of mine wiht my two kids, but it would be just as easy to pull out your larger carpet shampooer and clean it up that way. Clean up of the machine makes it not any more convenient than the large machine."
2,Won't Last Long !!!,"I purchased this for spot cleaning and it worked well at 1st. My only complaint was that it only worked for 3-4 minutes before having to be recharged(24 hours). So if you didn't finish , you're out of luck till the next day. After about 6 mos. the nozzle started to get mildew spots on the inside which can't be reached to dry and the unit leaks the cleaning solution out of the plastic when in use or in storage. It makes a mess and can not store the cleaner in it (which you mix with water so you have to dump it and waste it). Would not recommend for long term use."
2,Didn't Clean Very Well,"I bought this cleaner in 2000, and it worked okay for the first few years. I was VERY disappointed that it only worked for 5 minutes and then had to be recharged. For spot cleaning, it worked fine, but for serious stains (mud and wine), it did not work as well as I thought it would. Also, the holding tank would leak, even when I made sure to tighten it. A few months ago, when I would plug it in for recharging, the red ""charge"" light would flicker, or not even come on. I ended up throwing it all away about a month ago. Not bad for $30, and almost 5 years of heavy use, but I give it only two stars because of the small amount of time it can work and that it didn't clean some stains."
3,Pretty powerful little machine,"Charge doesn't last very long, which is ok since I only pull it out for spot cleaning (usually due to my dog having one of his can't hold down the food episodes). With one or two exceptions, it has been able to completely remove the stain before the battery died (even if the stain has been there a few weeks).My major beef is that I lost the power cord and, apparently, the only place I can get a replacement is through Bissell. Once the shipping is added, I can put a few more dollars in and buy a brand new machine (which I'll probably wind up doing through Amazon)."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!This product must be the most poorly designed product in the world! After using this lousy thing multiple times, because we have 2 cats, I am sick and tired of using this piece of junk! 1) It leaks like crazy from the sides when solution is poured in, even when you hold it steady. 2) The battery runs of out of power after a few minutes. 3) You can't just plug it into an AC adapter because it runs entirely on battery power. So if you can't finish cleaning up, you have to recharge it 24 hours before using it again! Don't waste your money on this thing. It causes as many problems as it solves!"
1,Do you want to clean for less than 5 minutes?,"Battery life is only 5 minutes, and then it takes 12 hrs to charge. I know I can't clean spots that quickly. Plus it leaks the dirty water. And just when you notice the leak, the vacuum battery dies. Might as well have just used water and paper towels, it would have saved time, and money."
2,If you're into disposable cleaning tools ...,"This worked well for a couple of years, then the batteries died. Replacement batteries are difficult if not impossible to find and customer service's rude response was that ""You can try to get the battery pack from Radio Shack or any local electronic retail store. We just know it may cost more for a new battery than purchasing a new machine."" The truth of the matter is that the local Radio Shack no longer bothers to carry such batteries. HOWEVER, I was able to purchase the raw materials for an exact replacement battery pack for $7.40, with assembly time of about 15 minutes."
2,Doesn't last very long!,"I have had several of these. The only reason I keep replacing them is that they are rechargeable and I don't have to deal with a cord. However, I've purchased my last one. They quit working or start to fall apart right after the warranty runs out. I lucked up one time and got a warranty replacement, but, for the price, there are others out there I'd be willing to try before buying another. They do a good job, but they are expensive for something that only lasts a year."
1,Not a good at all,I bought this cleaner to clean up after my cat and after about 4 or 5 uses it started to leak all the time...the bissell seems to leak more then it cleans. It is pretty irritating. This machine does clean ok but I would not recomend this to anyone.
2,j.Kehoe,"When I ordered this item, I thought it had a 18' cord. What do I need to do this get this changed. Thank you. J. Kehoe"
3,No Charge Life,"this is a wonderful little tool for those quick spill pick ups, but as far as being able to use it past about five minutes..NO WAY. this thing has no life to it at all! i am in the market to get a new one and i will NOT get this one again ONLY because of the charge life!-traci"
2,**1/2 -wonderful product but short shelf life,"`I totally agree with the lady who wrote about the frequent breakdowns. I loved my spotlifter and it was 49.99!!! It was worth every cent though with 3 dogs, 2 cats, and a husband! However, at about exactly 9 months, it just completely quit working. I have a large bissell steamer and hope I don't have the same short service life. With a name like Bissell, it looks like they could create a more dependable product. I MISS IT! Hopefully they will come up with a solution and maybe **HINT**nice coupon for those of us who lost out but are still dependable Bissell users."
1,Buy paper towels instead,What a waste. It is far better to just use spot cleaner and paper towels than this thing. Makes noise but does little else.
3,Convenient but cheap,"This machine has been a life saver on many occasions as I have three children and a puppy. I could not live without it!However, it is very cheaply made. The plastic just seems to disintegrate. Especially around the opening for the dirty water drain. And it leaks when it is upright on the wall charger. I have had to call the company for replacement parts twice in one year.I keep buying this product (three times) because I can not find a similar one (cordless) of a different brand. My current one is about to be unusable and I am once again trying to find something as great at this one.If I don't find another brand, I will buy this one again because of its convenience, size, and out of neccessity."
2,Get something that doesn't run on batteries!,"It's nice to have something that's small and handy to quickly pick up carpet spills, however...The battery life is way, way, way TOO SHORT; mine runs about 5 minutes tops, then I have to charge it for hours before I can use it again. Get something you can plug in and run until the job is done.The suction is pathetic; only a very small percentage of solution gets sucked back into the reservoir.It's very messy to load with solution, and even messier to dump the used solution.Mine leaks.Conclusion: get something that doesn't run on batteries, and check out how you use the thing before you buy it."
2,Think Twice,"If the primary reason you are getting this is to quickly grab soda and drink spills on the carpet before patting it down with a towel it works well. It is not a ""Deep Cleaner"" by any means. This device will not run for more than 2 or 3 minutes before needing charging again. I have found it handy for a quick clean up option to a towel when something spills however would definately get something else if I had the chance."
1,Give this one a miss...,"This is not a very well-designed product. The water tank tends to leak, and the suction is not great. However, the most annoying feature is that the charge only lasts about 5 minutes. I have a toddler and a cat, and only seldom can I get their messes cleaned up in that little time. I have found that using Resolve carpet cleaner is much more effective."
3,Ok but breaks down,"I think this unit does ok in the job of removing spills that have just happend. It is invaluable in that role.But I also strongly agree with other reviews that complain about short battery life, and especially frequent break downs. I have owned two and both lasted about 9 months. I expect better. I think there is a design flaw where liquid can leak into the power supply and short it out."
1,Will not last,We put this up on the flagpole around July 1 and by the last of August it was coming apart.
4,Great read for daughter,"My daughter will be opening up a bakery and this book is a valuable tool. After just reading a couple of pages she announced, ""this is just what I needed."""
2,Cute entertaining video but not a Sleep Saver,"I heard about this video while watching an old ""Dr. Phil"" episode. It recommended this as an excellent sleep tool for getting your kids relaxed & ready for bed. It worked the first two nights but it made no difference after that. I think he started to tune it out after watching it repetitively for a couple weeks. My son is entertained from watching the animals, though does not want to watch it regularly any longer."
2,Book is a great read-Quality Not What Advertized,"I love reading this book-borrowed it from library long time ago. So I bought it. Since it is a paper back I chose Very Good Quality-received a book with Bent front cover, Very bent as in broken. I will not be ordering used books from this Dealer again if a Very Good Quality book ends up looking like what Other dealers would have listed as Acceptable. a VERY GOOD should Never have a Creased Cover! I will have to fix the cover so it will not be coming apart real soon."
4,"Old Tin Sorrows by Glen Cook (A Garrett, P.I. novel)","Old Tin Sorrows by Glen Cook is a Garrett, P.I. novel. I'm not sure which one in the series this is, but they can be read stand alone without hurting their enjoyment. If you are a fan of Cook you'll enjoy this book. Fans of humorous fantasy noir will also enjoy it. I think it's a great read."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"The beauty of the Kinkade works is impressive as usual. In some portions of the DVD, video clips cycle around too rapidly- not allowing one to study the beauty of the artwork. When I purchased this DVD, I was hoping that vocals would be of restful high choral quality. Soft accompaniment with string instruments would have been preferred, not just a basic church organ hurrying to keep up with the beat of a metronome."
3,disappointed,"I recently saw the Christmas Thomas Kinkade DVD while at a friends Christmas party. It was beautiful instrumental music along with the Kinkade pictures. I asked for the ""33 best loved hymns"" for Christmas - hoping it would be similarly recorded. It is not! This one has vocals on each song. The previous reviewer loved the singing. . .guess it just isn't my type of music."
3,Ninja... hot sexy nude female ninja warrior oh yeah,"Well...it's low budget but looks like a real movie not some amature cam movie.the women are hot, very nude, silly anime like powersninja powers from their ... mmm ... feminin parts and so ona lot of blood and nudity and fun.it's a fun movie to watch and very entertaining"
4,Lovely story,Heidi is a story of love. Children and adults will be moved by the power of young Heidi's gentle spirit and loving nature.
5,Delightful,"What a delightful story! The acting is superb, as is the scenery. This is a movie for the keeping, to watch over and over. It's clean and refreshing compared with so many movies out there. It's great family entertainment, and it teaches some very important lessons about life. Heidi chose to focus on the positive, chose to love and give inspite of being rebuffed by some, even by her own grandfather, who when he saw what a dear child she was, let her into his heart."
2,not so good,"I have to start by saying that the scenery was very pretty in some parts of the movie. However I bought this movie for my eight yr old daughter, and the actors had such an accent that even I couldn't understand what they were saying. The ""actors"" were very poor on acting. Sadness and Joy were only shown through a facial expression. Peter was a grumpy brat who threatened to slap a baby goat. My main complaint though is just the lack of decent acting on the part of the characters. Nobody was very convincing. I would not recomend wasting your money on this feable attempt of a movie"
1,Wrong CD,I received a cartoon version instead of the one that I ordered. I have ordered a lot of things through amazon and this is the first time this has ever happened.I sent the CD that I received back with no problem.
3,They took God out of the story,"The only reason I give this review 3 stars is because it's a decent, conservative, family film about love and nature. The moral of the story, though, as we (my children and I) learned from the book - which we read before watching the movie - is that God answers prayer and forgives us no matter what. This basic foundation of the story that was so carefully included by the original author was completely ignored in this movie. I am so disappointed. I read the reviews before buying to make sure not to buy a ""cinderallafied"" version, and this accomplished that objective, but it's such a shame that they took God out of the story."
2,The arrogance of filmakers,"Yes, the scenery was wonderful, and Max was a good choice for the role of Alm Uncle, even though they change his name to Uncle Alp. But where do the filmakers get license to change the story so? What kind of arrogance might have led them to think that they could improve on the book? How do these changes help anything? Obviously I feel that they don't, and that they should have stuck to the book more closely. Then there are the accents, which are hard to believe in Switzerland. And the grandfather telling her to 'get out!' - yea right. Even the goats got their names changed. Finally, Heidi doesn't look anything like the Heidi described in the book. So, here it is : if you want a good story with a cute little girl in the mountains, it's worth your 100 minutes. But if you're looking for Johanna Spyri's excellent book to come alive, you might be disappointed in the end."
4,WORKS,"This net works and only took 15 minutes to install. Hardest part is determining where to install it, I put mine right in front of where tailgate used to be. Is there a big market in stolen tailgates or something? Anyway I only got the net to barrier my dog in so she won't be tempted to jump out. It's real easy to put on and off, quick release pins. It fit a full size chevy fine. I leave it off unless I need it, you could put a gate or cord lock on it to make it harder for someone to steal if you wanna leave it on. There are two sizes available for small and full size trucks, measure your tailgate first to make sure."
3,Don't take it uptown,"The Turbonet rails are galvanized steel with holes punched in them for a locking pin. The rails sit in plastic inserts that have little holding them in place. The net is stamped vinyl. Overall this unit is a slight step above homemade at a homemade price. Very serviceable, but don't take it up town."
3,What was that?,Nobody mentioned that the lyrics are in Russian! It's not good for belly dancing as this language isn't traditionally associated with that form of music. I'm trying to enjoy it so I don't feel like I purchased yet another belly dancing CD I can't dance to!
2,The Sledders Complete Handbook,"SnowmobilingSnowmobiling : The Sledders Complete HandbookThis book is a good start, but more info. is needed for a starter snowmobile r. The pages are pretty bare containing very little info, but it does contain the basics."
1,Not Worth Buying,"I can usually find some, if not a lot of value in most books I read. But honestly, this book has no redeeming value whatsoever. It's descriptions and advice were so brief and incomplete that I think it could actually be dangerous. I would beg any reader that needed any valuable info on snowmobiles, riding technique, accessories, etc., to look elsewhere. You won't regret it, and it may actually save your life.PS The amount of extreme positive reviews truly amazes me. I can only assume they are somehow tied in by relationship or business to the author."
4,Any firm doing business in Europe should read this,"The subject of antitrust is perenially contentious. Here, we have a European take on it. The authors look at the limitations Europe places on agreements between firms. A nontrivial consideration, especially because in the years since the book came out, EU authorities have discovered and broken various price fixing cartels. Some were in vitamins [!] an in basic chemicals. Firms involved have included huge multinationals; several European-based in fact. Naughty, naughty!Thus, the book is not about academic debating points. The issues involved and the case law discussed may be worth contemplating by a broad spectrum of firms doing business in Europe."
1,It doesn't get much worse than this,"The best thing I can say about this CD is that it is kinda fun to try to figure out what they were trying to play. This ""music"" is worse than a bad high school marching band on a cold night, not because of the style or concept, but just a total lack of ability. The last time I paid to hear music this bad was Blind Melon opening for the Stones. Too bad zero stars is not an option."
5,A delightful book!,"Charmian Carr has written a delightful book about herbeing Liesl in, ""The Sound of Music."" The notes from her fans are very enjoyable to read and heart-warming, how they were so touched by the film. Jean Strauss is also an author of it as well. It's a delightful book, full of interesting letters, and stories. Also it has many lovely photos, of then and now. I highly recommend it. It is great fr anyone, whom really enjoyed the fim, ""The Sound of Music."""
2,Not for Mac users,"I bought this keyboard, because the features looked very nice. Then I tried to connect it to my Mac via USB to take advantage of GarageBand. But, after many, many hours of research I found that there is absolutely no way to get it to work with my computer. Casio need to develop OS X drivers and having contacted Casio it looks like this will never happen."
4,I'm highly satisfied with this machine. It was worth the $200 I paid for it.,"Ok, so I like this machine, a lot. I actually play with it more than I do my Wii, really everyday, which is great because I don't actually know how to read music. That said, I sound pretty good just following the lit keys. It has inspired me to study music more in depth, too.There are some improvements I'd like to see, for instance the LCD is hard to see, it is not back lit, I'd like to be able to break songs down into sections to practice them without going through the whole song, and the TV function seemed a little underwhelming, but I'm highly satisfied that this machine was worth the $200 I paid for it."
2,does not fold properly,"when i saw this i thought it would ""fold n go"" but does not fold in 1/2 like it was designed to. just sort of flops around and 1/2 way closed and 1/2 way open. the velcro on the back doesn't work so well so doesn't stay closed.if i were to buy a diaper changing pad again, i would just get a regular one."
1,Not worth trying,I was annoyed with this product a few days after using. The cover I don't even use anymore because it is a pain to take off and on. Plus the detachable sides are flimsy. Will be getting different one soon.
2,Buy another brand if available,"This changing pad had fallen apart on me, and the company doesn't issue refunds. My son is only 4 months old, I would expect a changing pad to last longer then that.Don't waste your money look for a better made brand."
2,I returned it,"I bought this changing pad but once I opened it up I decided to return it. The side bumpers go half the length of the pad fully attatched and the other half of the bumpers attach by velcro so that the pad can fold in half. However you must remove the cover to detach the two halves of the bumpers which makes it a pain to do and not as easy as it seems (it isn't really that hard but understand the process isn't just grab and go). When the changing pad is laid out flat the bumpers don't line up smoothly and the area where the pad folds is also bumpy. On the plus side it felt sturdy, was covered in vinyl that would be easy to clean and the cover that came with it was soft and fit the pad well. I am not really sure when you would use this product. For most travel the changing pads that you keep in your diaper bag would be fine and this pad doesn't really fold up that small so it would still be bulky to travel with."
1,Too Stinky For Me,"Upon opening this item, the cover gave off such a strong formaldehyde smell that I knew I wouldn't be able to wash it out sufficiently, so I decided to look up Organic covers online. While looking at Organic covers, I came across some Organic pads, which informed me that the vinyl used in pads like this is also not good for my baby.I am only so concerned because I have Multiple Chemical Sensitivities and cannot be around anything that emits fumes, so my baby can't either. If you have a very strong tolerance for new clothing, which ALL contains high levels of formaldehyde (as well as does carpeting, furniture, flooring, cabinetry, kleenex, just about EVERYTHING not labeled as organic) and you like the smell of a new shower curtain, (I used to), then this pad is maybe a great bargain for you!For more advice on the chemical dangers of today's modern world go here: NikNice.comOrganic Changing Pad for those who are sensitive like me:L A Baby Cocoon Organic Changing Pad, Gold, 32"""
2,Book was OK,"The book was OK. It was interesting to hear ""Lumpy"" tell of ""coming of age"" in California in the 50's and early 60's. I wish there had been more behind the scenes about the show though. Who would have thought that ""Lumpy"", (Frank Bank), would be a whiz at investments. It is good to hear how all-or at least most-of the people on the show did turn out to be productive adults despite being on a top rated show and growing up as t.v. kids. However, buy a used copy and not a new one. It's not that good of a book."
1,Don not buy.,Disappointing book! Spent very little time covering the Beaver or New Beaver days. Who gives a dam about his alleged sexual trysts.
3,Hey- Stop giving Lumpy THE BUSINESS!,"After reading quite a few reviews of this book, many of which I agree with, I've decided to give Frank a break. I re-read this recently after about 3 years, and the writing style is interesting in a 'Holden Caulfield' kind of way. It IS about his life, after all, so he cant be blamed that much for not more 'Beaver'. I think he's being rather honest. Plus, he had some significant other credits. Just once I'd like to hear him cry out to Richard Deacon, 'Daddeeee...!'"
2,Could have been better,I was a little let down bt this book.I bought the book expecting to read a lot about life on the leave it to beaver show.but there is very little about beaver in this book. I think Frank could have made this book more interesting if he would of written more about the show and cast. I am now looking forward to reading Jerry Mathers book maybe I will read a little more on the show.
2,not great,"The older edition had a better formate of the context and was much more easier to read, even though colorful pictures are helpful"
4,Anesthesia Careplan Powerbook,This is the book where you can get concise information for your anesthesia care plans. Currently there is not a better one out that which summarizes the operation and the anesthetic plan on a couple of pages.
2,"A basic guide, not an encyclopedia","I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping for a text in which I could look up cases I wasn't already familiar with (I am in 4th year of Residency in Canada), but I found that every time I wasn't familiar with a case, neither was this book; i.e. it didn't have ANY listing of the procedure at all. This kept happening repeatedly, and now I rarely bother to open it. If you are a beginning resident who doesn't know how to do anesthesia for a lap chole, this book would be great. But for Anesthesiologists and senior residents looking for a more encyclopedic reference for outlining not-so-common surgeries, save your money (it's not cheap) and look elsewhere.As a good point, the layout is excellent and very useful for those procedures that are there; I hope the authors intend to expand this book in the future as it has great potential.AJ"
3,"Not bad, but","It doesn't describe all the procedures accurately, and sometimes the descrption of the procedures doesn`t change my anesthetic plan. I think it was written from a surgery point of view, rather than the anesthesiologist"
4,Handy Reference,"A handy resource to have on hand, especially if you know what your cases will be, or what speicalty areas you are in."
2,No better than previous edition,"There was a great deception for me - almost nothing new since previous edition, for example, remifentanyl doesn't existe, no evidence based data for certains anesthetic managements.if you have a previous edition, it doesn't matter to buy this bookit can be good stuff for a junior anesthesiologist.Michael DZIADZKO, MD, PhDBelarus-France"
4,slow at shipping,"ordered the item on 12/8 for a Christmas present, they state it was in stock but failed to ship until 12/21 - too late to arrive before Christmas. I consider this a fatal error on their part & would opt to order elsewhere if needed in a timely manner."
2,Confused in USA,"The incredible noises and colours in this film make it tricky to follow at times to say the least. Yet I do believe that Goddard was sucessful in achieving his goal presuming that it was to combine completely irrational cinematographic sounds and images with relavant political tensions very typical of the era. There is the strong influence coming from French fascination for all that is American. I would recommend this film to those allready accquainted with Goddard's work as without concentration, it would be very hard to follow, if not impossible otherwise."
2,Made in the USA (Born to Ride),"This film features dirt-track (not motocross) riding, Harleys, big bikinis, and annoying ""music"". The crash scenes are interesting but eventually become tedious. It is too long, self-indulgent, and under-whelming. Any of the films from the Brown family (of ""On Any Sunday"" fame) are much better productions of much higher caliber."
2,See the Movie and Call it Done,"I saw the movie first, then started reading the book on a airline flight, thinking it would be different (different character development, more details, more to the imagination, etc.). As it turns out, the movie and the book are about the same. I've stopped reading the book. I didn't think the movie was that good either."
2,Too much talking,"Too much talking with too little action. Not easy to follow, actually skipped pages as the character talked their way through essentially useless garbage. Hope movie is better (have not seen it)."
2,Over-talky,"Over-talky. Good dialogue becomes wearing. Also, could not ""invest"" in any of the characters.Never thought Higgins could be a bore."
2,I can see why its out of print...,"I know its silly to review and out of print book, but I just finished this one and so I thought I'd put it out there...This one follows in the tradition of 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle', but where that one was fresh and engaging, this one is a little overindulgent.The story consists of a lot of run-on dialog of ex-cons telling stories about themselves in crime and in prison. There is a plot about ripping off a local card game and the ensuing pusuit, but you have to get through the repetitive dialog of the participants telling story after story about thier lives.I would get it from the library, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,I could not finish it because of all the talking.,"This is a fictional story about a card game robbery being investigated (to borrow a term) by Jackie Cogan, a mob enforcer.The non-dialogue passages are very descriptive and well written. One can almost smell some of the characters. Or hear the rumble of the cars.To be honest, I stopped at page 76. This as I could not get past the characters' dialogue. Too many times, the characters would go into a monologue either introspective or about the other character in the scene. I just didn't get it.I'm going to go with three stars as I did not make it through. The non-dialogue parts are good. The dialogue parts I can't get. I checked this one out from the library. Perhaps you should too."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing my TR0355 from Target three months ago. The door has never closed tightly and the ""toast"" button stopped functioning this week. There was a time when the Black & Decker name was synonymous with quality. Please save your money and do not buy this product."
1,toaster oven a thumbs down,"We own the TR360 Toaster oven for about a year. After the first 2 months, the toaster button stopped working. Now, a few months later, the whols even doesn't work. I called their customer support, and the best they could do is sell me a new one at a reduced rate, which was double what Amazon was selling it for. The say since I don't have the receipt there is nothing they can do. Very not happy with my unit. (PS- when it worked I liked it, so if you don't get a lemon, then I guess you'll be OK) With this product I say ""good luck!"""
1,Wouldn't recommend,Several burner rods burned out only after a few months of use. The toaster button was always tempermental too.
5,What is all the guff about?,"I only bought this toaster a month ago but I think it is great. It is compact, yet big enough to bake plenty of food in, it warms up quick, and you can mount it under your cabinets to save counter-space. I am glad I did not review the reviews first. I bought it in the store and it was the cheapest one there!I just hope my toggle switch does not break."
1,Faulty Switch,"I received this toaster over for my wedding last May. By January of this year, the toaster flip switch broke. My mother also had the exact same problem with her toaster. We now have to use the broiler switch to operate it. I would not recommend this toaster to anyone!!!"
2,Switch broke,We loved the fact that we could mount this inexpensive toaster under our cabinets. But we had to take one back within the warranty period--it died. And now the toaster switch is broken. So we feel stuck--because we have the mounting hood. I wish there was another product that would fit...
1,Wut kind of idiot would buy this?... oh.... i did.....,"when my family and i purchased this TRO355, it was perfect. A small compact toaster/oven. Didnt take up much space. But still had a fare capacity. But then after 2 weeks of use. the top part of the oven turned brown.. And the paint was boiling.. (really a nasty smell)and we wer just, ""ohwell"" then the start button got stuck... so i hit a it with a hammer and it popped right out... soon... the toaster knob fell of. so we jus glued it bak on. BUT NOW THE DOOR WONT CLOSE!!! my family and i endured the crappy qualtity of this product. And wer did it get us.. no-wer.... Just plz buy a better more xpensive one... dont waste yur cash on dis crap.... unless you plan to use it for a week..."
5,black&decker toast-r-oven,"I have had toaster ovens for many yrs?I would not change from black&decker,very happy with my choice of broiler ovens."
1,"junk, junk, junk","From the outset this toaster oven would soemtimes buzz or vibrate when toasting -- it sounded like a piece of metal was loose somewhere. I was afraid to leave this alone in the kitchen for fear that it would light something else on fire.Now, after less than 6 months of light use (ie mostly toasting, reheating things -- no baking or cooking) the broiler switch has broken off in the on position, which means the oven is constantly on unless unplugged. We are still using this for toast, but as soon as I buy a new one this one is in the garbage.Don't buy this oven!"
1,Black and Decker Quality Going Downhill,"The toast function stopped working after six weeks with this unit. The toast button refuses to stay down. The Black and Decker brand used to be dependable for quality, but no more. My parents have one of these, and their toaster makes funny buzzing and dinging noises while toasting, but at least theirs works so far. I'm never buying another Black and Decker product again."
1,Burned!,"I was the one who got burned when I purchased this piece of trash. From the second week onward, this toaster failed to work properly. The return policy was just too much trouble with which to contend - something Black & Decker counts on, I'm sure. I guess B&D is true to its name: Bondage and Discipline; however, you'll be the one who takes a beating.DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER!"
1,lousey toaster oven,I have bought three of these ovens in the last six months and all have become defective. First one lasted 3 months-had no replacement guarantee so I had to throw it away. Second lasted 21 days. Third one and a half hours. All of them became defective with the toaster button not staying down to make toast.The last one actually sent out sparks when I put the toaster button down. Never buy at Best Buy as they care nothing for customers and any satisfacation. I hope you do. I had an old toaster of yours and it lasted 15 years.
1,Defective product,This oven worked (poorly) for less than a month. It totally shutdown thereafter. Cannot recommend to anyone.
1,Very disappointing...,"We received an older version of this toaster oven six years ago as a wedding present and it worked great for six years. When it finally died we bought another one, brought it home and the button to toast wouldn&#146;t stay pressed. We exchanged it only to find the button didn&#146;t work on the second one (after one day) either. I&#146;m really disappointed because I thought Black and Decker made quality items, but apparently they&#146;ve gone the way so many other companies do these days&#133;making products that are just plain cheap!"
2,Shopping for #3!,"The toaster switch on my 2nd B&D toaster oven (mounted under the cabinet which is very convenient)has quit so I've been ""toasting"" using the broil feature and flipping the toast to do the other side. This means keeping a close eye.....I've ruined a few bagels recently when I forgot to watch. I figure it's not worth sending the thing back to the factory; it's out of warranty anyway. Glad I read the numerous bad reviews; I was going to keep the faith and get my 3rd one! Really did like the mounting feature!"
1,What a piece....,"Alright first off I was considering ordering this toaster oven off of Amazon but I figured I'd just go to Target. When I opened the box, the little rubber feet fell right out from under it. When I opened the door to place the trays in it, The door came off the hinge and refused to go back on. If anyone is even considering buying it, I suggest you completely wipe this out as an option. Yes it is [inexpensive]... but I would rather put a little more cash in to buy something of better quality."
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought this toaster from Target, pulled it out of the box to find that one of the dials was already broken. So, I returned it and bought another one of the same kind.From the first use, it would begin to buzz loudly toward the end of the toasting cycle. (Not an alert of the end of the cycle, just an annoying buzz.) Toasting is controlled by a switch and a dial to control darkness. The switch is poorly aligned, and is not the ""timer"" type where you know how long it will be on. Toasting is inconsistent.It seems like the only ""pro"" with this device is that it's cheap. Yeah, it's just a toaster oven, but our really old one worked much better than this one did until it died. I went against my better judgement and bought the cheapest one and sure enough, got what I paid for. I'll be returning it--again."
2,Bad zener diode is what causes the switch problem with these,"We had one of these for about six months and it ended up having the switch problem listed in other reviews. It turned out to be a 6.2V Zener Diode on the timer board that was causing the problem with the switch. Switch is held by electromagnet which is controlled by a digital timer circuit. Zener is part of power supply for the CD4060 chip in the digital timer. It is an easy fix if you are handy with a soldering iron. The diode itself costs around 25 cents. It is the only glass diode on the circuit board. After replacing the Zener diode, it works like new money again. Zener diode is part number 1N4735A. Hope this helps someone else fix their oven!"
1,piece of junk,"We actually bought a model up from this basic toaster oven. But, much like the entry level model, this one is also a piece of junk. Maybe Target wised up and stopped carrying the model that we purchased. The toast button doesn't work or only works occasionally. I would be better off starting a fire outside and trying to get toast. Not only is Black and Decker quality crap, but their web site is crap. Try finding warranty info, or heaven forbid, a phone number to call and complain. I think I'll just eat the $50 or 60 that we spent on this boat anchor.P.S. I also bought a Black and Decker iron that is going in the trash with the toaster oven. The damn thing shuts off in the middle of ironing. You don't really notice until water starts leaking onto your shirt instead of steam. I replaced this iron with a Panasonic iron. It is a great piece of equipment. No problems."
2,Hate this toaster,"I've been given two of these toasters. The first one lasted for several years, but the toast quality was never very good. The second one died after only 8 months. It toasted better, but as far as I could tell, the bottom no longer opens for cleaning. A pain. I'm not unhappy about its premature death."
1,Don't Buy,I received this toaster as a shower gift. This toaster only lasted two years. The on/off button won't stay down anymore. Also if you are toasting something and it isn't toasted enough and you push the button (when it worked) again it would only toast again for like 30 seconds so you would have to stand there and keep pushing the button. IT STINKS!!
1,Obvious Differences,"I have this toaster, purchased it last year. Takes FOREVER to toast bread. It is pretty obvious from reading the reviews that Black and Decker has handed the actual manufacturing of this product over to someone else. Had I purchased this 10 or so years ago, it probably would be still working wonderfully. However, as mine is one of the new versions, it would be faster to toast bread by rubbing two sticks together."
1,Defective??,This toaster oven won't TOAST!!! Broiler works....but I didn't buy it to broil my toast. It is going back!
1,What a disappointment,"I was also glad to read the other reviews on this since my toaster button stopped working so soon after I purchased it. Sadly, I lost all the warranty registrations and receipt when we moved so I couldn't return it. I know Target would have made good on it if I would have kept my receipt. So, now I'm looking at toaster ovens made by anybody but Black and Decker."
1,Lasted 8 months,"Great concept in toaster ovens. Space saving design. Worked great when it was new, but top heating element burned up after 8 months."
1,the worst of B&D,Poorly made. The parts don't exactly fit together. Toast on switch sparks and is intermittant. Burns toast at any setting. Now Blacker and Decker is closing all the US manufacturing and cutting jobs. See ya Black & Decker.
1,Avoid this one,"This toaster will not stay on, there is a problem with the way the door closes and apparantly the toaster will not stay on if the door is open or the toaster thinks its open. Very aggravating especially early in the morning. I will buy another brand."
1,caveat emptor !,"I would give this product, and the customer service related to it minus stars if I could. I have just read all of the other 74 reviews and concur 100% with all of the negative reports.I just ordered this toaster oven online (NOT from Amazon) and when it arrived the toaster switch did not work at all, and the oven made a very load buzzing noise as soon as it started to heat up.The online co. I ordered it from said I 'd have to contact B&D; for a refund. B&D; said it wasn't their responsibility, and I would have to deal with the online co. I could go around in circles like this indefinitely and it's not worth it ! The toaster oven goes to the dump !I'd just like to know how they can get away with continuing to pawn this piece of junk off on the public !"
2,The old ones were the best.,"The first model I had lasted probably 6 or 7 years. The next about three, then about a year. This one only a few months. Too bad. I really like the undercabinet mounting. (I don't think you can get those mounts any more.) The latest model has a printed circuit board to operate timer, and something in it must have given out. Naturally, I didn't keept the receipt to try to get it replaced under warranty. Even at only $30, I don't think I will go again. Have to find a place on the counter, and go with something else."
1,Unanimous,"Yes, this is indeed the worst appliance I have ever encountered from a (formerly) reputable vendor. The open-door-shut-off does not work on any of the three units I have encountered. The toaster button on mine at home has failed as described in other reviews."
1,Wish I had read consumer reviews before I bought mine,"My black and decker under the hood mount toaster would toast the first slice ok. Second toast onward it would not toast at all. The toast switch would switch off immediately. Recently the switch died and I had to resort to ""baking the toast"". Obviously, there is a problem with the toaster switch. I feel Black and Decker should recall all its toasters and give consumers their money bcak. As pointed out, the only redeeming quality seems to be the mounting feature."
1,Toast Its Demise,What a piece of junk. Our first one of these broke on its first use and the replacement worked for about two months. Based on this whole experience I'm not going to ever buy any black and decker products. They really should have stuck to tools.
2,Heating elements burned out,The element on top burned out and B&D; has stopped making this model. So the oven hanging hood can longer be used. They are replacing the oven and waiving the fee's since I can no longer use the hood.This is the second replacement in less than I year.
4,Toaster oven,I have had my Black & Decker Toaster Oven now for over a year. I have had no problems out of it. The only reason I did not give this a perfect 5 is that the under the counter mount is very hard to find. the only place I have found it other then B&D website is at bed bath and beyond. When you have a small kitchen like myself you need every bit of counterspace you can get.
1,2nd B & D toaster oven a bust,I had my 2nd B & D toaster oven less than a month when the toaster toggle switch stopped working. I had used an earlier model for 10 years and replaced it only because it looked worn. What a disappointment! I love the mountable feature but will not buy another.
2,"cheap, but not the greatest...","I didn't have switch issues like many of the other reviewers, but have found that over time regular cleaning has removed the temperature numbers around the temperature gauge. Now I just have to guess what temperature I'm using! It's okay for the price, but definitely not an appliance you'll have for the long haul."
1,Broken toast switch,"Within four months of usage, the &quot;toast switch&quot; became difficult to hitch into the toast position...within five months, it had broken completely. A toaster oven that doesn't toast is about as useful as a car with no tires or a computer with no monitor. It's pretty handy if you want to fill up your trash barrel come collection night, though."
4,You Gotta GIve it Up...,"for Niqui Stanhope, this book is definitely one of the better Arabesque Novels that I've read. It was worth the money I shelled out for it, and it actually held my interest, unlike some other BET books that I've read.Even though in some parts, near the end, it dragged on a little, but the story of this woman learning to trust and love again, while avoiding someone who obviously wants to hurt her, was definitely worth the wait.A delightful read, if I do say so myself!"
3,Is this an African American Romance !,"The story was ok, but the characters are so nondescript you could just as well have a blonde couple on the cover. I enjoy reading AA Romance novels because they are about black characters. There is usually some connection I can feel with the characters, be it family traditions, physical description or whatever. Tall beautiful and dark eyes could be anybody. Ms. Stanhope, you are a talented writer, but please don't loose sight of who your audience is. If I didn't care who I was reading about I would read Danielle Steel."
5,"True Love Is Like A Circle, Let It Go and It Will Return!","This was not one of Ms Stanhope's normal juicy romantic novels but I truly enjoyed how she captured this plot of dealing with spousal abuse. It is a very heart warming story where you can't help but be like a cheerleader for Racquel as she seeks towards finding some happiness. You never know in life how someone you cared for from your past who moves away can re-enter your life when you least expect. This story is defintely full of surprises and has a twist of suspense that adds a flavor of interest to this book. The only thing missing is the ending seemed to be cut short, as though another chapter or epilogue could have been added."
1,Native New Mexican finds fictional county an unnecessary distraction,"As a native New Mexican, I find the invention of the fictional county of ""San Phillippe"" to be a major, unnecessary distraction. As a result, I couldn't get past the first 50 pages of the novel. As a result I threw the book away rather than passing it along to one of my friends who might have been interested in it."
5,Versatile Product,"I used this on my cat who was urinating blood, and the vet could not figure out why. It did indeed help and she recovered. I know this is an off label use, but it did the job. A while later I started having urinary symptoms myself and began to take it. It also cleared up my issue, so in my opinion, it is a very valuable product to have around, and I plan to keep it on hand. A bonus that it is inexpensive too!!"
5,sweet Moses this is good stuff!,This movie is a kind of beautiful combination of the existential concerns of Kurasawa's Ikiru with his Samurai films. It reminded me of the mission and I was instantly in love with the protagonist's two daughters. This is a drama. The fighting means nothing except in it's contrast with the two daughters. Swords to Plowshares - is there nothing more beautiful than watching children grow?Highly recommended.
5,Twilight Samurai,"This is a very fine example of an actual lifestyle of a Japanese Samurai. Played brillantly by Hiroyuki Sanada, a long time actor and martial artist under Sonny Chiba and the series Kage no Gundan, and his latest role opposite Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai, Hiroyuki-san did an outstanding and emotionally touching skill of bringing out a truthful rendition of life in late Samurai periods. There isn't a lot of sword slashing in this movie, it wasn't neccessary. But it does show what is more believable. Not everything was as rich and clean as in the other movies of an earlier time. Highly rated, and very much enjoyed.David Schleifer: Author of ""Battlecruiser: Prototype."""
3,English subtitled,it is a great movie. just warning that the English subtitle is NOT removable. It is there all the time. It can be annoying for near native viewer.
5,Truly amazing and beautiful in every way.,This is as realistic as it gets for a fictional samurai movie. I've now watched it 3 times in the last week. I then went to watch The Last Samurai with Tom Cruise for the 2nd time to compare but could not bare it.
3,Counter-culture samurai,"The low-ranking samurai has secret fighting skills but loves peace. His tribulations are multitude: he just lost his wife, he has 2 young daughters who he wants to see educated beyond traditional standards, an alzheimers mother -- and too small a stipend. What's a samurai to do. Well... he talks alot. The cover art of the DVD I saw promises action. It's a lie. There's about 2 minutes of very reluctant fighting in a 2 hour movie. Still, it should be mildly interesting for adults. Amusing for philosophers. Obligatory for aging hippies."
2,Twilight in your eyes,"I titled this movie under that name because if by purchasing this film you are thinking that you are buying a samurai sword fighting movie think again. This is a love story with only maybe two fight scenes in the whole film one in the middle and another at the end, now mind you that this is also a fairly long movie. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because I thought I that was buying a fight movie which this isnt."
2,Great Movie - Worst DVD Quality EVER,"Great Movie - 5 Stars. One of the best Samurai films ever made. Refreshingly modern take on the genre.TERRIBLE DVD quality - 0 Stars . Basically it looks like a VHS tapeThe image is poorly colored and drab. The resolution is horrible, the entire image is fuzzy and noisy. The subtitles are huge, and their glued on! You can't turn them off. The image is also Non-anamorphic - which basically means it doesn't fit a widescreen tv.By comparison the recent Criterion re-release of 7 Samurai which was made in 1954 looks better!Please someone (Criterion) remaster this one for the good of mankind!"
3,"Magnificent Film, Poor Transfer","This is a magnificent movie and a truly moving tale of a poor Samurai who yearns to live the life of a farmer, raise his two little girls and live in peace. An accomplished swordsman, however, events will conspire to shatter his vision of domestic bliss. Called upon by the reigning warlord to avenge a blood feud, Seibei Iguchi will find himself once again forced to draw his sword in anger. (Yes, that's the same plot as 1000 other Samurai and Cowboy flicks, but the story-telling really sets this one apart).That said, though the story is 1st rate, the poor video transfer of the U.S. DVD release mars the experience. It is not even a 16:9 Anamorphic transfer, but merely a 4:3 letterbox screening. Show this film on a screen bigger than 13"" and you'll weep. For this reason I can only give it 3 stars."
2,Horrible DVD quality,"You can read the other reviews here to get an idea of the movie, but I have to warn people that the DVD transfer is very poorly done. The video is faded and looks cheaply produced even on a standard TV. The video is non-anamorphic (it's incredible that a NEW movie like this could be encoded this way) so it looks even worse on an HDTV because you'll have to ""zoom"" in on the picture to get rid of the black bars. The subtitles are burned-in to the video so there's no option to switch languages or turn them off. Finally, the audio is stereo (2 channels) instead of 5.1. It's incredible that such a fantastic, recent movie could get such horrible treatment on DVD. Empire Pictures needs to get with the program."
4,don't buy it here,I am thinking of buying this mail box- but not from this site- another site has the same mail box for $50.00. Check around before you buy!!!
1,book i never got,"well i really dont know how i can review this item when i never recieved it as of yet..please send me this item then i can review how i feel it will help,,,thank you very much"
2,Anemic suction/cumbersome to clean...,"You may get sucked in by the cheap price of this hand vac, but there are better ones on the market.Some issues:1) Suction is anemic. Unless you are picking up stuff on a hard surface, you will have little luck. Works best picking up tiny pebbles on rubber mats in cars.2) Cleaning out the gunk is impossible without spraying dust everywhere.3) The charge doesn't last long. After a few minutes, you'll be back to the charger.Unfortunately, with all hand vacs, especially low-priced ones, you have major trade-offs. I've found that the ones that plug into the wall outlets have much better suction, but that can defeat the convenience of a cordless vac, for places such as your car's interior.This gets two stars instead of one because it can fill a need for someone who rarely needs to use a hand vac and simply wants the cheapest one around.Just don't say I didn't warn ya!"
3,"Overall, a pleasant read.","This story is a sweet shonen-ai (not yaoi) with nice insights on Japanese culture like kendo and summer festival events. It's a light story devoid of any weighty plot or angst, with some sweet moments. What I liked about the story is the way the characters remain masculine and don't fall into weak/strong stereotypes.The characters' relationships are low-key, which may lead to some readers feeling their emotions are washed out. Another factor contributing to that impression is that there's nothing more intimate depicted than a kiss or two.The artwork is very nice, in my opinion. Each character is distinctive and easy to tell apart from others. I feel the artist did a nice job with backgrounds, too."
5,onesie for girls,"This is an awesome t-shirt for those sweet baby girls with no hair. Everyone seems to call them ""cute little fellas"" without knowing that they are actually little girls. This shirt stands up for them, and tells them ""I'm not a boy!"" Perfect baby present for your friends! Fits most babies newborn to about 3 months of age."
2,Disappointed.,"The author's lackluster story-telling left me dizzy. There was no glue to hold together what should have been a phenomenal story---especially considering her background. And the attempt at explaining the math, physics, chemistry, and nuclear science was inept at best.A shame."
5,Animal Friendly Enlightenment,"As an active animal advocate always looking for help on animal cruelty awareness, the tips give concrete advice and scripting to those who want to help educate the public. One can begin education within the home then spiral publicly outward. It's never too late to start.As Berkeley Breathed has been quoted in this book, ""Thankfully there are many options to reduce the suffering of our critter friends. Find them within these pages."""
2,Hidden Agenda's,"While all warm and fuzzy and appealing to the humane part of all of us, Ms. Newkirk and her organization does not give full disclosure. They are totally against No-Kill shelters and rescue organizations and totally against feral domesticated cats and their rights to live as best a life as a homeless creature can.Unfortunately the readers of this book will only see what they want to see, albiet through their heart tugging tears. Not the reality for which Ms. Newkirk's organization stands."
5,A Basic Book on Menopause,This book was written by a male AND female doctor without prejudice. The are very conservative about hormone therapy making this book a standout among the others.It allowed me to make all my own choices. I also found it simple to understand and reassuring.
3,Oil pressure,"I was looking for an electric gauge and bought this one. Well, it is a mechanical gauge. No where on the box does it tell if it is electric or mechanical. It went back to Amazon with with their easy return policy."
3,"They Shoulda Been Huge, But......","Oh, the poor Pezband!!! Killer songs, tight playing, great vocals--what happened??? My guess is that being on the Passport/Jem record label, they got zero promotion and with the flood of groups in that 77-79 era got lost in the shuffle. This Cd/Lp, their third, is a bit weaker that Laughing in The Dark (their best) and tied with Pezband (their first). I would recommend it though as a classic example of Power Pop. Plus the live stuff tacked on at the end shows what a killer live act they were. These guys are back playing now and I'll bet they don't disappoint....."
1,I am now dumber for playing this game...,"I give it to you straight. This is the worst game in my collection. The graphics are horrible, not even as good as Master of Magic that was published fiver years earlier. The music isn't good enough for an elevator and the game play couldn't be any worse if it tried.You can't build new cities, you have to pay to bring items with you...The whole game is stale and unimaginitive. The map editor is hard to work with too. They pain, the pain... It just won't stop. I haven't played this ""turkey"" since the first week I bought it six months ago."
2,Decent but nothing to stay up late over,"This game grows boring rather swiftly. The story is near nonexistent, the game play hardly challenging. I was looking for a spiritual successor to the old Master of magic game but this is far less control then that was and just rather dull."
4,The Complete Diabetes Prevention Plan,"If you want to learn the ins and outs about diabetes, this is the book. Great, detailed information presented in laymans terms. The only draw back is that it does not give the sugar content in the recipes."
2,Was a gift...,"I can't exactly say how the book was, since it was given to my mom that is pre-diabetic. She is having a hard time eating healthy food and was not impressed about the book. I did read the reviews and researched it and for those that are interested in changing their eating habits, it seems it would be good."
2,Too much,"This book is supposed to coach you on how to ace job interviews, but the author tries to cover all too many bases and end up being obfuscating rather than helpful."
1,Madonna? Alternative? This book is NOT about alternative rock!,"Since when does an unoriginal who has simply trend hopped and who has spawned more talentless airheads in her own image than one can role call and who has countless top ten hits, qualify as ""alternative?"" Someone at SPIN was obviously trying to kiss madonna's masculine behind because there is absolutely no reason for her to be mentioned in this rambling, misguided attempt at covering the alternative music scene of the late 80's to 90's. Ani diFranco, Courney Love, L7, Bikini Kill and PJ Harvey yes. madonna, a resounding no. This just proves that SPIN was a ""madonna magazine"" largely. No thanks!"
1,Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!,"Zalman says their coolant can accumulate when people don't use distilled water. If this is true, it is by no means the whole truth. Like many others, I used the additive packaged with theZalman LQ1000 case, which is essentially a Zalman Reserator XT pre-packed into a mid-tower case. I was sure to use only distilled water, and I flushed the coolant regularly. Like many others, my flow meter was destroyed.My story has a happy ending: Zalman shipped me a new flow meter, I replaced it without incident, and none of my components were otherwise damaged. However, I will not use this coolant again. Common wisdom suggestsFeser Oneinstead, so I'm running that now. Zalman's otherwise good reputation and support notwithstanding, DO NOT buy this product."
1,Caused build-up in my Zalman,This product gunked up so badly it clogged the pump in my Zalman Reserator XT. I had to junk the system. I would NOT suggest using this product.
4,If you like Lords of Acid - you'll like Crud,"I bought this CD after hearing a couple of Crud's songs on Myspace. I enjoy it very much. My favorite track is ""Girls That Swear""."
3,Ipod video cable,"The day I got it was working fine,the following week cable wasn't working fine any more, had to wiggle it to work. It problably was an defect. I wouldn't buy this again. Everything else,service and sll Greattttttt."
4,Love this wallet!,"The wallet looks great - the quality is very good, there is lots of room, and it will last a long time. The color is a little darker than the picture indicated, but still very nice. Definitely recommend!"
1,Wallet,The wallet was constructed well but arrived with an offensive odor. So bad it was not usable.
5,Lovely wallet-Nice price!,"The quality of this wallet is obvious when you touch it. It is soft, smooth, supple and just ""feels"" expensive. It has plenty of slots for credit cards and ID's.My only problems were that the checkbook was a little snug for my thick checkbook and check register and I had a little trouble inserting my gun license into a slot. It's a little wider than my driver's license. But those are minor things I think.My experience with the seller was hassle-free and only added to my satisfaction."
2,credit card slot too small,"This wallet is okay but the credit card slots are too small. I tore one of the slots trying to get a card in the wallet. What's the problem with making these slots bigger? It doesn't cost, but it makes the wallet unusable for most puposes of keeping cc in the slots. Would not purchase again."
4,Really nice wallet,"I purchased one of these for myself and one for my mother. This wallet is very nice. Appears well made and is set up efficiently, not too many pockets, not too few. So easy to organize my things and move from purse to purse. The leather is soft and supple. Only problem is that it is hard to get my license out of the see through card area but it is really no big deal to me. A product well worth the money. I will be buying more for gifts."
1,Disappointed,"I received this wallet and wasn't that happy with the quality. I thought I'd give it a try anyway. When I tried to put my checks in the checkbook holder I found that it was too small! I had to cut the backing of my checks in order to fit them into the check book. Once I got them in, the checkbook wouldn't close. I've never had this problem before. I guess I'm going to have to go to the trouble of sending it back. My advice is that you pass on this wallet. It was disappointing."
3,Idea great. Quality poor,"I liked the concept of this wallet. Plenty of storage and organizational features. I returned it because a part of the inside was not quality made. The area had ripped away from where it was supposed to be. The company was great in a prompt refund. It may be that the wallet I purchased was just defective, and had I exchanged it for another, it might have been fine. I instead opted for a refund."
4,The recipient was very pleased,I bought this item for my Grandmother for Christmas and she was very pleased with it.
4,Overall a good buy.,"I'm not giving it a full five stars because it's a little less well made than I would like. That said, it's still an bargain for the price."
1,Terrible product,"the zipper ripped after 1 day of use, i used it mainly for my cards, which is about 10, the card section is fine and the zipper was not stiched properly and hence started to tear, without me even filling it. It is poorly made and i would not recommend this to anyone."
2,womens credit card check book cash id wallet MW4575,I was very disappointed in the quality of the leather. It certainly was not of the quality and appearance as advertised online. The leather was of an inferior quality. I bought the burgundy. Would not recommend it unfortunately.
4,"good wallet, good price","This was really a bargain. Very well made, very nice looking. Zips up nicely and holds a lot. When it's full it's maybe 3/4 - 1 inch thick, so it wouldn't be good if you wanted to put it in a little purse. The only minor problem is the credit card slots were a little tight but they'll probably loosen up over time. Also I had some trouble trying to cram my check book register in there but there is a place behind the check book you can put that in if you have to."
1,Very disappointing,"Wow was I surprised when I received this wallet as a gift. I had added it to my wish list after reading all of the great reviews. This wallet is one of the cheapest, poorly made wallets I have ever owned. Granted I usually purchase my wallets at high-end stores, but still have never paid over $25.00 if that. The seams on the edges were ragged and sewn terribly. I have had wallets for over tens years that are in better condition than this wallet. Unfortunately that's one downfall regarding orders online.......you can't actually judge for yourself."
4,Nice!!,"This wallet got a 4 instead of a 5 only because of the lining. I would have preferred a little more substantial interior. It has a silky like fabric. Maybe it will last better than I think, I hope so. The wallet itself is soft, pliable, plenty of room inside. I agree with another evaluation that the checkbook cover doesn't work inside, too narrow---but I took out the cover and just use the purse to put my checkbook and register in the slots that are where the checkbook cover went...works fine!!"
5,Nice women's wallet/organizer.,"This is a nicely organized and well built wallet bought for my wife's birthday. It's a bit smaller than the one it replaced, but she had no problem transferring everything in to it. It looks like the zippers and leather are pretty high quality, but time will tell. Assuming that it lasts, I would definitely re-order."
3,Crinkly and worn- looking,"I was surprised of how crinkly and kind of worn it looked. I know that this is the style for some purses and these types of purses do sell well. I was expecting something a little more attractive and more of a sheen to it, it is matte-d down. Nevertheless, I will keep it because I can find a place for it in my wardrobe."
2,Not What I Expected,Not too excited about this light. I don't feel like it does what is it is advertised to do. I kind of wish I didn't buy it.
5,Great Product,"Does just what it is supposed to do. Makes the winter a little more tolerable.Not much, but a little."
5,Happylight!,"I love the light! It does work. All I have to do is turn it on and sit in front of it while I am having breakfast for at least 30 minutes each day and I have already felt a difference. I hate being SAD in the winter! So, many thanks.Carol V. Mather"
4,Verilux HappyLite Mini Ultra,"Have been using this light as a desk light near my computer - at the 45 degree angle recommended - for about a month. I find the low setting produces plenty of light for reading, writing, browsing, etc and doesn't produce glare - very easy on the eyes. By using it in the morning while I read the newspaper or check e-mail, it is easy to fit the light exposure regimen into my day. I'm happy with this purchase."
4,Bringing Sunshine into My Dark Existence,"I received this as a gift recently and I have to say I'm quite pleased. It fits perfect on my desk in my office and it provides a good amount of light. I like the fact it has two settings. One which is very bright, the other which is a little more mellow. I'm not sure if works for making you happier, but I'm happy with the product I received."
5,happy light works!,"I enjoy my work day as a respite from the impending winters gloom. It does what it's supposed to and has a cool look to it. The two light intensities are nice, I like to amp up and then down again to replicate a summer sun."
2,Verilux Happylite Mini Ultra,"Lamp puts out very good, non-flickering light. However, it is cheaply contructed with the lens cover easily dislogded. For $100, this is unacceptable."
2,Verillux Natural Spectrum HappyLite is a Florescent Light Bulb,"I purchased this item thinking it was a natural light but was disappointed when a lighting specialist told me the item holds an expensive florescent light bulb inside. I cannot use florescent lighting as it irritates my eyes. Disappointed. I purchased two of them and wanted to return one but the store told me they would charge for their shipping original shipment cost plus 20% restocking fee plus my shipping back to them - would cost as much as the product itself. Again, Disappointed."
1,Broke second day,"I was so disappointed. I should have payed more attention to the negative reviews. I'm not the first one this has happened to. The lamp arrived and worked yesterday. Today - nothing. Won't turn on at all. A complete dud.It's such a shame because the lamps looked great and has a nice footprint for my work desk. I did note on the one day that it worked, that there wasn't much difference between the bright and dim settings. But that's irrelevant now that it is busted. Returning for a refund because I can't trust it."
2,nothing to brag about...,This lamp is actually annoying. Its just like a fluorescent light bulb. No noticeable mood change whats so ever.Add on: 9/5/08 (within a year from purchase and only a few hours usage!)CAUTION! Mine flickered a couple of times and then went POOF! I turned around to see what happen and there was smoke coming out of back of it!! A few days later I decided to see if it was the bulb and the light still works but now I am afraid to use it..
2,chintzy,"While the lamp looks OK at a distance for its purpose, it is really not something anyone who cares about style would want around. The bulb is where the true value is in this lamp; the rest of it is just chintzy. I am returning it and instead will put a full spectrum bulb in an attractive, higher quality lamp."
5,Verilux HappyLite creates a Happy light inside,"I received this light about a month ago and it is fabulous. It's very bright for its small size which is what makes it great. I use it in a small bathroom and so I'm close for at least 30 minutes in the morning. It has made a big difference in my mood and attitude. I feel brighter and lighter. I wish I had bought it months ago.The light is lightweight so I can move it around from place to place without any issues. I think if I wanted to use it in a larger room or further away from me, I'd buy the larger light. But, this is perfect for me in the close space in which I use it.It was very easy to put together and even though its a lightweight plastic cover, its very sturdy and durable.Worth every cent it costs."
4,SAD Verilux desk light,"The first item I received was defective, but the company that sells this product shipped a new one out right away. The light works great - much more effective than I had originally thought. Very bright, easy to use and has a sleek look."
2,Glare,"The light is too white for those who are glare - sensitive; same light as in generic Verilux desk and pole lamps, which works fine when hooded, but does not create same effect as protoypical light box."
5,Excellant product,"The Happylite is one of the best values for the money. Although it is a little difficult to get the light cover to snap in place, the lamp is otherwise easy to use. And extremely bright. Seriously, this desk lamp- sized object is, by itself, almost bright enough to illuminate an entire room."
5,Less fatigue; more cheerful in Cubicle world,"I've used this rather unique light for a little over a month now, and am completely pleased with the results. I work in a 9' x 6' cubicle, lit only by the hanging fluorescents, which actually make my work space feel cavernous. The Verilux light immediately makes its presence known, and almost completely cancels out my awareness of the yellowish, sickly cast fluorescents. I do not find myself getting heavy bouts of sleepiness anymore and am generally more alert. Whether or not all of those physiological and emotional changes can be correlated to the Verilux or it is just placebo, the independent virtue of this lamp is in making me temporarily forget about the carcinogenic, pathetically unflattering aesthetic of the ceiling lights."
4,Bright!,"The lamp is nice, but very bright for my wife to use at work in cube world. You're not supposed to use this all day per directions, only for about 1 hour a day and morning is best. So don't plan on using this in place of a desk light."
4,instant sunshine,"Verilux Natural Spectrum HappyLite Mini Ultra, SilverBright light but not harsh. Great way to start the morning. Whether it really works or is just a placebo affect, I feel much less sluggish even after a couple of gloomy weather days if I use this while I eat breakfast."
2,Not worth the money,"First, don't get me wrong... I like this item. It works. I just wish I hadn't bought it. How come? Because when I took it out of the box, I felt ripped-off.It's cheap. It could have been made in China for less than a dollar, based on appearances. It contains a compact florescent lamp worth (perhaps) about $10. All I can say is that Verilux has awesome chutzpah to put the words 'full spectrum' and 'light therapy' on the box, magically transforming it to something worth almost $100.The people who buy this product need help. Verilux is taking advantage of that, and using it to gouge people."
1,Not as pictured.,What I received is not like what is pictured. It is the tiny version. The wink in the hand on the box shows about a half dollar size. The ones I received are smaller than a dime.
3,Not too bad,"This was a fairly nice product. The chips are the same as what I remember from when I was a kid. However, I wish the cup that you flip the Tiddlywinks into was bigger; it's too small for most kids to aim at and they get frustrated when they can never make it in. I'm using a small soup bowl instead so they can still have some fun."
3,Skimpier than Expected.,"I was a bit disappointed by the size and quality...this item is a small cardboard package ( maybe about 8""?). There is no board or mat...note number of discs before ordering...cup pretty small ...rules are in tiny print ...If you like the idea of giving a nostalgia gift, fine...if you want to seriously play Tiddlywinks, there are other sets of better quality."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to playing this with my grand nephew, then I received the very few pieces. The photo of the bag that holds the pieces appears to be full. The description never says how many pieces or sizes. It implies there are four players because there are four large pieces, then eight medium-sized pieces and a dozen very small pieces. This is not enough for four people to play, so I got out my buttons and added them to the group. They work great with the large pieces. So, NOW, more than one or two persons can play at a time, and it should be fun. The plastic pieces appear to be thinner than I recall, but my buttons will complement them nicely.I purchased them through Amazon, and they qualified for special shipping."
3,lack luster,"the old tiddills were fun, and the tiddler was robust and commanding. a little feeble tiddly catcher and anemic projectiles"
3,mixed feelings,It was a nightmare to install the fan in the pre-existing opening. The design is intended for a new construction. The flap is flimsy and it broke off in the process of the installation because the pins holding it in are too weak. The fan works well once installed but it is not a miracle. I have mixed feelings about the design - it is unnecessarily too complicated and also expensive. Had I paid more attention to all the features I would have chosen a different model.
5,"So quiet, never steamy","Granted this is a bit overkill for the size bathroom I have, but I love how quiet it is. I took a boiling lava fountain shower for about 45 minutes, and the room is never all steamed up after. Best part is the auto humidity sensor. I never have to worry about forgetting to turn it on, it just goes on when it needs to. Perfect."
3,Anderson meets Howard,"As with several other authors (De Camp, Carter, Jordan, Carpenter), Poul Anderson takes a retrospective stab at recreating Robert E Howard's Hyborian world and chief hero - Conan the Barbarian. Anderson spins an entertaining yarn with all the elements you would expect in a Fantasy novel. However, Anderson, as with most 'modern' author, softens the barbarians character to be more suitable to contemporary audiences. While this is certainly laudable to remove sexist overtones (remember, Howard was writing in the 20s & 30s), it fails to capture the flavor of the original."
2,not very good,"I was feeling the need to read something different, so as I walked past the new books section at the library I saw a Conan book. I've never read Conan, but one of my friends is a giant fan, so I picked it up.The plot was pretty simple (hero gets even with sworn enemies who have wronged him in many ways, along the way he gets to use a magical weapon and fulfill some prophecy), but it was entertaining enough, especially in the middle. The ending was way too abrupt (he completes all of the above parenthetical accomplishments in 35 pages) and the language was too clunky. I realize its a style thing, but it's like Mr. Anderson sat in front of his typewriter with a thesarous and looked for the more macho version of each verb used to describe Conan's behavior. He never throws anything, he heaves it. He always cleaves skulls, rather than splits them. I got tired of it rather quickly."
2,Can't understand Spanish,I ordered this because I thought it would be very interesting. I'm sure it is except the one I received is in Spanish. I don't speak or understand Spanish so it is of no value to me. Anyone want this in Spanish?
2,i l iked it,Title: Strengthen the Mind Composer:Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Performer:Takato Nishizaki and Malcolm Bilson
5,great music,"CD arrived in excellent condition. The music is very uplifting, soothing and relaxing. Well worth the purchase"
3,Important to remember it's not proven,"It's important to remember that the Mozart effect has not been proven. The behavioural consequences of listening to Mozart is not unique, and can be achieved with any classical music, since the mozart effect has nothing to do with behavioural consequences, but subtle changes in the brain. The pattern of Mozart's music is thought to correspond to a coding mechanism of brain cells that created more dynamic circuits...but remember, it's not proven."
3,A certain nasty charm,"Deadly Little Secrets might not be the best film of all time, or even this year, but you should check it out because it has a certain nasty charm that one rarely finds these days. While most thrillers are just gruesome or just violent, this one was, well, I don't want to say cute, but... You'll know what I mean when you see it."
3,Disappointing and misleading,"Actually, I would rate this book 2 1/2 stars because although this book purports to be a color atlas of oral cancers, in reality, only half the photos in this book are actually of cancers or precancers. The other half (every other page, in fact) are of histology slides of cancerous cells - something that is not clinically helpful, and would be of interest and useful only to a pathologist."
1,Mr.,This battery pack has not held a charge for a reasonable amount of time. All of the recommendations have been followed. I would NOT recommend the purchase of this item.
3,living legends cd,the cd was alright only a hand full of good songs i liked. i would not recomend this to no one. also alot of the tracks were just intros to the next song.
4,another REVENGE masterpiece,The living legends crew has dropped another s(oul)cially conscious cd. Its a little less pure beauty than the Black Sands... but its still just ill. I think the Mystik Journeymen etc are the best rap group today in terms of translating the emotion they drop at live shows to vinyl. Get this plus every other thing related-please!
4,like much.,"Like it. Nice looking. Not flimsy looking like the cheap one we had before. Nice remote. Buttons are easy to use, and thicker than the last one. My only problem with tower fans is that the surface area of the wind-producing part is so narrow. I miss pedestal fans, but I have a kid and do not want her sticking her finger in it."
5,SHE LOVES IT,"Bought this Fan for my Babe! I searched a lot of sites incl. local many stores for a decent looking fan. But, I was out of luck because it was peak season in August out here in LA. Guess what, we're in Sept. & just today we had 102F. So I'm sure this Fan will stay with her for a long time."
1,Worst product I've ever purchased in my life!,"This piece of junk was very wobbly from the get go then it just straight up broke from its bottom base plate. It's so top heavy that the bottom part cannot support it, very terribly constructed design! Idk how this is still available in major retail stores. This is such a sensitive fan, you can't even move it from one position without it eventually falling apart within a few months. It works ok but it's build like crap. Don't buy it, HUGE was of money unless you plan to NEVER TOUCH IT!"
2,Broke after 2 years,"I really liked this fan. It worked great. Suddenly, with no advanced warning, it wouldn't turn on. I have 2 other fans that I have been using for 10 years and are still going with no problems. I expected this to last for more than 2 years! I will not be buying any more Lasko products!"
1,Not worth the price,"There is a great deal of hype surrounding this fan online. I must conclude that all these glowing reviews are posted by shills.This fan does not produce a strong airflow. In fact, it barely runs on the low setting. I bought mine from Walmart and within two weeks I had to lubricate it and I still have to use a butter knife to coax the fan to turn just to get it going. It will not run at all on the low setting.Its cheap engineering and under-powered motor makes this product a rip off at $50.I wouldn't waste time on this."
1,not satisfied at all,"it does not circulate the air at all, just rotates a very small space, we have been trying to contact you to send it back, but the hold time is way to long."
3,Fan,I found that I did not need the product and tried to contact the vendor. The box was unopened. Never heard from them.
4,Nice fan,"After a lot of research, I bought this fan. This is my first fan but its a very good one. Even at slowest speed I have to take blanket at night (Its 75-80 F right now). It has a very elegant look and takes very less space. The only thing that I am not happy about is that its power chord is a little short. But, thats fine. All in all, a very nice fan."
3,Loud Beep,"This fan emits a shrill beep when you plug it in, again when you turn on the power button, each time you make any adjustments to the other settings, and yes, even when you turn it off. I dread pushing any buttons due to the annoying noise, and feel that my hearing will go down a couple of decibels if I had to hear this noise everyday. I have resorted to pulling the plug to turn it off. Great fan otherwise."
1,Broke after a year,"My son bought this fan and after seeing how well it worked, my mother and I decided to buy one for each of us. So, there were three fans. After one year of use, the first broken was mine. The fan didn't work. The second fan broken was my mothers' the fan didn't work either. And the last one with six months of difference was my son's. My son didn't use it as much as we did so probably that's the reason it lasted more. I did my research and found that the fan has a defect in two resistors that overheat and burn out. Definitively WON'T buy from Lasko again."
3,Using in the bedroom and affecting toaster oven in kitchen????,Like this much more than the Vornado Mid size 3 speed air circulator. Its much quieter. I can actually hear the tv on low. (not so with the Vornado). It throws allot of air even on low. In fact I haven't had it any higher than low. My concern is that although I have it in the bedroom it seems to be tripping the adjacent kitchen emergency circuit breaker. Everything on that adjacent wall fails to function till I reset the outlet. My house was built in 1976 so I don't know if the fan is drawing an abnormal amount of electricity or what????
2,Not Great,this was my replacement solution for the old oscillating fan on a stand. not sure if it's this model or this particular unit but:the fan makes a light clicking sound all the timeonly 2 of the 5 remote functions even workthe stand is pretty flimsy but that is less of a problem than the previous two characteristicshopefully there are better ones on the market. if it were not so big and going to be a HUGE hassle i would return it.
3,title,"this item is not at all as quiet as the one a friend of mine has and it is the same product, so I am not at all very happy with this product, but it costs to much to send it back."
5,"OUTSTANDING fan, works great, looks great","I found three of these on a hardware store website in 2008 and they are FANTASTIC, quiet, powerful, good-looking AND they come with remote controls AND the remote control stows in a little docking bay on the back of the fan!DO NOT HESITATE to buy these while they're available! They'd look great in an office, really well-designed and manufactured. There's a simple assembly procedure which should not pose any problems to anyone, just put the fan on the base. There are three settings, an ""Ion"" setting (not sure what it does, but when you select it a blue LED comes on which looks nice), a timer feature and the oscillating feature. Good strong breeze! We've bought a lot of fans over the years (it's hot here) and this model is the best of them all!"
1,not worth the $,This fan stopped working about 1 year after we purchased it. We barely used it for 6 of those months.I've had $30 fans last longer.
3,Nice if you don't want to use the Ionizer,"We just purchased this fan today. It truly cools the air nicely and the oscillator works well, however when the ionizer is turned on the fan shuts down. We've never had an ionizer, however we are fairly certain they are supposed to work in conjunction with the fan. We have to admit that once the ionizer is turned on the fan is extremely quiet, soundless even. Of course, this could be due to the fact that the fan shuts off when we turn on the ionizer.We are exchanging the fan and hopefully will receive a ""non-lemon"" replacement fan."
3,Different than original,The Blue Ray is different than the DVD. The DVD is the music plus the documentary. The Blue Ray is music only and they left out the most awesome young horn players. I know as I am from N.O.
3,new allins' funky good time!,"Great music, great people, and a great time. I learned about the great influence New Orleans had on all types of music, from country to rap. Please rent or buy this DVD if you love a great time! Three Stars!"
5,"Easy shopping, thanks.","Easy deal, product was good quality and speedy delivery. Thank you very much. Would recommend you to anyone looking for the deal to be kept."
5,Great DVD!,"Great DVD full of great music, history, and culture! A must have for fans of New Orleans."
4,Great but for one......,"Good to see the *Kids* again, though embarrassed for the including of The Wild-man Of Borneo......a bit too much. It was funny as a kid, but I did not know any better! All else was great, and cleaned imagery was good too!"
3,Not restored.,"Of course, the content is amazing. No one since has gotten performances out of kids like you'll find on these shorts. Word of warning, they're racist as hell... well as racist as people were in the 20s and 30s, which is... very. Also, until later years, these didn't have much of a plot or story. Mostly some cute kids getting forced into weird situations and filmed with a few slapstick moments.The quality on the other hand... not so good. Audio is sometimes very hard to understand, and I'm not just talking about Buckwheat. Someone said these were taken from the Cabin Fever restorations... that is a lie. I have a few of those on VHS and they're another world of quality. Sadly, they're gone and hard to find. So if you're looking to get the Our Gang comedies for a decent price, I guess this series is pretty good, but it's no ""Cabin Fever"" for cheap."
5,Plus Metered Aerosol Dispenser,These are pretty good. You can put them in your bathrooms and bedrooms. Refill is just every 30 days.
3,"Cute and inexpensive, but not solid brass","3 stars is rather generous for this one.I bought this as a gift for a collector in my family, for whom I have been purchasing hourglasses for the past decade. I value real brass and unique styles, so this seemed to be perfect. However, when the description says ""brass frame,"" they mean Brass-colored thin metal, or at best, VERY cheap brass.The piece arrived with visible splotches of rough discoloration (not to be buffed or polished away - I tried), and was crookedly mounted on a thin wood base. The base is almost too lightweight to support the frame, and seems unsteady.If you are looking for a cheap decor piece that will last a couple years, this one's fine, but if you want a piece that can be passed down to successive collectors, look elsewhere.Amazon, however, did an excellent job with shipping quality and speed. Super saver shipping got here within a week (unheard-of from them), with no issues!"
4,dakine wallet,"this is a good wallet, I bought it to replace a canvas wallet and it is good replacment,only problem maybe that the card pockets are too large, my cards fall out easily, but is not a major issue.I like the outside zipper pocket for spare key storage.plent of room for everything i carry and is not bulky."
1,Bye bye credit cards,"This wallet stinks. The pockets fit nothing and hold nothing in. All my cards fell out of the wallet when I opened it today, including my driving license."
5,FABULOUS!!!,"Fun and wacky, as usual. I have her entire collection and can't wait for the next book. If any of you dykes out there want to find a storybook with strong Latino girl characters (could be dykes when they grow up) check out, DRUM, CHAVI, DRUM!/ TOCA, CHAVI, TOCA! Add this book to your Dykes to Watch out For collection or buy it for the children in your family. The feisty little girl isn't allowed to play Congas in the Miami Cuban Calle Ocho Festival because drumming is for boys! She struts her stuff and won't take ""no"" for an answer... i think this book is a first of its kind with an all Latino cast, written by a Cuban, illustrated by a Cuban and set in a Cuban community. Another super FUN book for all you lesbos out there!Anyhow, I highly recommend the entire collection of DYKES..."
3,Slick Glossy Twaddle,"Interesting anthology, probably worth putting together, verylittle to do with 'Buddhism' per se, though it tries hard to makesome associations, they really arent convincing.The book leaves an empty taste and slight feeling of nausea afterreading of all the dopeheads parading off to Hawaii, the Amazon,or Green Gulch, in search of a 'real teacher' who would validatetheir drug desires. Trungpa's paradoxical positions on intoxication are described from a few viewpoints which make for interesting reading, and comparison with that of Suzuki Roshi's. If you like the vapid slickness of Tricycle's heavy paper and empty pages, you might like this book.Otherwise, your time might be better spent cleaning the toilet or doing the laundry, while enduring the ongoing decline and fall of human civilisation, the horror, the horror."
1,NOT REAL BUDDHISM,"First off, if I could I would rate this book a ZERO. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. This book has absolutely NOTHING to do with Buddhism or religion in general. Drugs and other intoxicants will NOT show you enlightenment. The only thing drugs will show you is what it's like to be on drugs. Real enlightenment comes from within. If you're serious about Zen, get a real book on it. Learn just what it was that Guatama Buddha taught. But if you're just looking for an excuse to do drugs, then by all means buy this book. Just don't make false claims that you're being spiritual. Own up to the fact that you have a drug problem."
5,By nine experienced and knowledgeable contributors,"Collaboratively compiled and edited by educators Pat Rigg (American Language and Literacy, Tucson) and Virginia G. Allen (The Ohio State University), When They Don't All Speak English: Integrating The Esl Student Into The Regular Classroom presents a variety of essays by nine experienced and knowledgeable contributors concerning the practical realities of teaching in a traditional classroom when only some of the students speak English as a first language. Addressing such topics as the language experience approach, using literature to support language acquisition, the cognitive academic language learning approach, helping ESL high school students achieve success, and much more, When They Don't All Speak English is very highly recommended for all teachers who are working with English As A Second Language (ESL) students."
5,Core curriculum for elementary music,"I teach general music in a Marine Corps dependents' elementary school in Okinawa, Japan. I use this songbook and its companion, volume 2 constantly in my curriculum. I consider them to be at the core of my teaching. These are songs that every American should know. They are a part of our common history, our culture, our heritage.These books were first suggested to me by a junior high choir teacher colleague who knew that I was interested in the Core Knowledge series by E.D. Hirsch. Thanks, Karen."
4,Great book from a great scholar,"This is a great overall introduction to the concept of spiritual powers as understood in the NT times. Dr. Arnold's background in early church history and practice makes the book that much more rewarding. I do agree that there are places where Dr. Arnold could have cited more sources for further investigation. All in all, however, he hits the mark in compiling a book that will help Christians (and others) better understand the NT Scriptures."
4,Best on the topic,"Arnold does a very good job of compiling all the biblical data on the topic of spiritual warfare. Very balanced treatment of the subject. I preached on ephesians 6 a couple of weeks ago, and bought this book specifically to help me, and it did."
2,Unhappy,Swanson health foods had the product description saying you get 6 boxes for $3.78. I ordered from them and was only sent 1 box. Since then they have corrected the product description. But in the meantime I only received my refund of $3.78 back from them and was still stuck with paying for shipping and handling charges. I'm a very unhappy customer and I do not like the way they handled the situation.
3,Beware no 1.5v,"I bought this. It does not include 1.5v as described. It switches between 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9 and 12 volts only. It does say it has a lifetime warranty on the package."
5,Maida's Little House Party,"The book was a rare find. It arrived in excellent condition, completing my wife's set of the Maida books and making a great birthday/Christmas present."
5,Zuma Deluxe,I enjoy playing this game very much. It has some many different levels and some are hard to do but it's a lot of fun trying to finish them.
3,It's okay,"Before I bought it, I tought I will like it. After I spent hours on it, I got bored. So it is okay game."
5,I loved this Game.,I had hours of fun with my family trying to beat each others score. I was sad when I couldn't install it on my new laptop. I've missed it terribly. :o(
5,Tight piano trio that swings with the best of them.,"My favorite Ray Bryant album, it swings like crazy, mellows down nicely and all held together by Bryant's incredible piano work. I have gone through two copies on vinyl and was thrilled to see it finally on CD. You may have to wait for it, but it's well worth it. Both jazz fans and non- alike have enjoyed this when I put it on."
5,A great book to get you back on the conception track!,"This book has some great information regarding numerous pregnancy issues. It uses basic terms, so anyone can understand the material. I highly recommend it to anyone who is pregnant, or considering pregnancy. This book really helped me cope with the loss of my 16 week pregnancy."
1,How to prevent miscarriage: lie down and take progesterone,"With one ectopic pregnancy and two miscarriages, I am looking forward to a healthy pregnancy next time. But it won't be thanks to this book. The title is misleading. The main advise is: when you feel or think something is wrong: see your gynecologist, go to bed and try progesterone. After reading te book I can only conclude: there are no ways of preventing a miscarriage. And his so called 97.5% succes rate for bringing healthy babies to term in his high risk pregnancy, is an absolute mysterie to me."
3,"Standard Fair, nothing special if you've used CF before","This book is ok, especialy if you are a newbie to CF programming. My problem with this book is that it reads alot like the CF 4.0-5.0 books that I've seen. The vast majority of the chapters are the same as the books befor this one, which is fine if you haven't used CF before. If you have, save your money, and get the CF MX Developer Cookbook, or The CFMX Bible, which will give you more ""how to"" info. You'll find the same how to create queries, how to create a loop, how to ...etc. type info that the CF 4.0-5.0 books offered. Of course this book includes new info (e.g. using CFC's, new functions. etc), but there's not enough of this to justify the money. Again this book is fine if you're new to CF, but if you've got experience with at least one previous implementation of CF, save your money, and buy one of the other books I mentioned."
2,Gel earplug,"This item was not what I expected. The ear pieces appeared to be made of plastic, and I could hear an annoying ""wrinkling noise"" from the material while I was trying to listen with them. Also, they were not comfortable to wear."
3,Not iPod In Ear But Good Imitation,"These head phones are not the iPod In ear headphones! But good imitation .I use them for my iPod Touch and it works good, sound is great. If you put them in your ear the right way you wont hear any outside noise and there pretty loud. Overall these are good headphones for the price"
1,You know what headphones aren't supposed to do? SHOCK YOUR EAR. Or short out your iPod. These do both.,"Product is inexpensive and arrived on time as promised. Those are the pro's. The con's are that the earphones shock my ear when I wear them, and regularly short out my iPod to where it won't work unless plugged in again.I get that this product is cheap- but not worth the possible ear damage and iPod damage.Ouch."
1,KZL 303....oh no! it's not a personalized tag!,"I have a phobia about public restrooms. and rest stop was like spending 85 in one. this movie isn't work the small paychecks they cut the actors. it all comes together at the end to really make no sense like it's some sort of ""ghost potty"" eeewww creepy. there's a pretty good R-rated sex scene which the movie sort of leads you to believe that this is the reason Jess & Nicole get into this situation. because she's a ""wh0re""...on the dvd there are 3 alternate endings none of which are better than the one they went with. the special features offers you scotty's blog expose for which i'm glad i purchased this dvd.over all the story goes nowhere so if you need a good ""REST"" is 85 mins. long enough??"
1,don't stop to watch this movie,"This film practically made me want to vomit, not for the sick twisted horror, but for the lack of it. I have never seen a movie that was this bad. No plot, no good acting, and more holes than a comedy spoof. It is a rip off of every film that has something to do with seriel victims and driving, these include texas chainsaw massacre, wrong turn, the hills have eyes, so on and so forth. What really got me about the movie is that at any time the girl could just leave the rest area in broad daylight, but instead she watches a porno of herself that was filmed by someone else and stays at the rest area drinking wild turkey. In my opinion she deserved to die for being so dumb"
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I caught it on TV and I am a hard-core horror fan. So I chose to give it a chance, never ever hearing of this movie. Let's just say that I had to turn it off 10 minutes before the end because I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't even care what happened to her and if she survived,that's how bad ths movie is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Just glad I didn't buy it,"I was curious about this movie and almost bought it, but after reading the reviews on amazon I thought I'd wait then my roommate rented it instead. Before passing judgement I must say that no horror movie earns high expectations but this one was way below par. I could get over the exremely cheesy plot and weak acting. But it was so impersonal, you never see the killers face, you never get a past history, and you dont get an ending. This movie is basically was just one of what appeared to be hundreds of murder stories that revolved around this bathroom. This is fiction people, if your not going to have anyone come out on top at the end then whats the point? Its like watching the news or something and not entertaining. This movie had a tad of potential but fell so short."
2,Not A Bad Time Waster,"This film is centered around a rest stop in a deserted part of California where a maniac terrorizes young women. There is not much of a plot to this film and there are some characters who appear and do not seem to have much to do with the story other than to just be freaky. Some of the acting is quite hammy. The gore is mostly fake looking. Still I wanted to keep watching the film to see how things played out. I was not completely bored but there are some slow moments. The main actress was attractive and likeable but everyone else just seemed like serial killer fodder. Overall, I give this movie two stars because it kept my interest and was not really a bad movie. It is not a movie that I want to spend my time watching again though."
1,NOT SCARY.....JUST STUPID AND PREDICTABLE,"THIS MOVIE STARTS OUT SLOW AND GOES NOWHERE. IT HAS SEVERAL FLASHES OF BRUTALITY LIKE HOSTEL DOES OF DRILLS GOING INTO PEOPLES LEGS OR A BOXCUTTER ACROSS THE CHEEK. BUT AT ONE POINT A POLICEMAN IS INVOLVED. HE GETS CRIPPLED AND CANT MOVE ON HIS OWN AS THE STALKER CHARACTER COMES AFTER HIM AND THE CHICK. THEY GO THRU ALL KINDS OF HIDING TECHNIQUES AND WAYS OF TRYING TO GET AWAY BEFORE HE FINALLY SAYS "" USE MY GUN"" !!! HOW STUPID MUST YOU BE( both of you ) TO HAVE A LOADED GUN ON YOUR HIP AND RELY ON IT AS A LAST RESORT??? ITS ONE THING FOR A MOVIE TO BE A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED- BUT THIS IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE AND DUMB. I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT TO AN ENEMY."
3,Not that Great,"It wasn't the fact that the movie had a slow pace starting, or that the acting was somewhat B rated. The effects were good, but what killed the movie was the ending. This movie had good qualities but a bad ending, not only that but we really didn't see much emoiton for the victims. It just seems that with the format of dialog and reactions, I believe the writer could have based a more sturdy emotional reaction for most characters. I really didn't feel sorry for any of the victims in this film because truthfully, they didn't use common sence."

1,UNORIGINAL INCOHERENT AND JUST PLAIN STUPID!,"I certainly wasn't expecting a masterpiece when I sat down to watch this horror film, but I was often confused and found this to be really worthless on any level. Besides being extremely predictable, it also contains many unexplained things - one being a former victim of the killer suddenly disappears, which could be explained as a ghost, but when a cop disappears after being killed, it just makes NO sense at all. This is only part of the problem with this mess of a movie. The actors are unconvincing and they do unnatural things in the situations they're in. The film is very unoriginal and we've seen it all before done so much better, even in bad horror films."
2,"Did not make sense, period.","The movie started off good, but then it went downhill real fast. There were stuff that didn't make any sense at all. People ""disappear""...not the abduction type of disappearing, but literally, disappearing. Then there were her actions that didn't make sense. During the movie, I kept asking, ""Why would she do that at that time???"" and ""Why isn't she doing that?!"" I feel like I wasted my time and $1.50 for the rental."
1,Very Scary... that this made it to market.,"HORROR in the writing !! The Killer could have been killed very quickly by the cop and his gun,... but NOOOO.. they had to DRAG this crappy movie on and on and on... DONT WATCH IT !!"
2,"Could have Been Better, Reminds you of cross between ""Saw and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""","Rest Stop: Dead Ahead is the first in this horror series about a couple of teens that stop at this rest area and find out there is a murdering psychopath living in a bus nearby. The acting is actually not too terrible. Joey Lawerence never said ""Whoa!"" and really doesn't have a purpose to the story. A really irrelevant scene is when the girl gets picked up by a freak show family in an RV. They go around in a circle and drop her back off calling her a ""Whore!"". The girl keeps revisitng the restroom where this evil guy apparently tortured and killed all of these people. Some parts made no sense and by the end you are asking ""What the hell did I just watch"" The alternate scenes are priceless though. Not too bad, but not great."
3,Haunted Bathroom,"I was very frustrated watching this movie as well. Basically, everything in the movie is supernatural. The girl is stuck interacting with ghosts of the past; there is no way she could escape or destroy the killer.This isn't explained and just leaves the viewer very frustrated.The 3 alternate endings ""EACH MORE SHOCKING THAN THE LAST"" is bullshi_. They are each DUMBER THAN THE LAST.The movie did keep my attention throughout, therefore, it gets a 3 out of 5 stars, but, yeah, it was also just annoying to sit through at the same time."
3,recommended to anyone looking for a good time.,"Another decent one from ""Raw Feed."" Aside from its obvious low budget, this is an entertaining little ""Survival"" flick. Decent gore, decent suspense. I wouldnt rank this among my top 20, but i'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good time.6/10"
3,rest stop,i had rented this movie and thought it was;nt to bad . i would not want to pay full price to own it though. it's not the acting it's that it just has slow parts .
3,Worth Checking Out on DVD,"Just in time for the Halloween season, Warner Bros. has released the movie Rest Stop on DVD. The DVD arrived in stores on October 17th. The film is about the terrifying struggle a young woman endures after encouraging her boyfriend to pull over so she can go to the bathroom while they are on a road trip. Nicole goes in the bathroom to relieve herself and when she comes out Jess is nowhere to be found. Where is Jess? On top of that, there is this crazed man driving a yellow truck who keeps trying to run her down. It's the same yellow truck that tried to run Jess and Nicole off the road before they stopped at the rest stop.To say that Nicole encounters some strange people is an understatement. And just where is Jess? She thinks she has found him when she hitches a ride with a strange family but it turns out Jess is not there, and the family is seriously wacked.Rest Stop is kind of a slow starter, but it's an okay flick to catch on DVD for the Halloween season."
5,Creepy Fun,"I'm all for this movie - it's like the reason for the season! My friends and I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel and we were watching through our fingers most of the time. Sometimes we yelled directions at the screen, sometimes we held our stomachs - we had a great time with this flick. The best part about a movie with newcomers like Jaimie Alexander is that you'll never know who's going to get the axe. I mean come on, not only will Michael Meyers never die, but neither will Jamie Lee! I'm purchasing this for my Halloween party... my boyfriend who's afraid of his own shadow, will at the very least appreciate the movie for the bare naked [...].I think most women are a little spooked by rest stop bathrooms, but now thanks to this movie, I'll have to hold me pee for a Burger King bathroom."
3,Rest Stop.,"I will be honest to say that when I ordered this movie I never saw it before. It was on sale for $7, and I'm a fan of scary movies so I bought it. I had a few jumps here and there the first time I watched it, but I was also a little confused. Second time I watched it, things came together and made more sense. Not my favorite horror flick, but I do plan on buying the sequel, Rest Stop: Don't Look Back. (which is supposed to explain everything.)"
3,Joey Lawrence makes a quick stop in an o.k. horror picture.,This is about what you'd expect from the cheesy title and the fact that Joey Lawrence is in it. It's an interesting ride and I even experienced some new feelings of suspense. There are a few surprising and well done gory moments and even a deformed little person. Joey Lawrence and the lead chick do some above average horror acting. Not a bad stop if you need a rest and want some easy horror with a very pretty lead actress and a fair amount of blood.
1,Juvenile,Dialog was unoriginal and juvenile. Plot looked like many others blood and gore movies. I hated this movie!
2,NO REST FOR THE WICKED?,"This gorefest from director John Shiban (TV'S SUPERNATURAL) is illogical and full of plot holes, but star Jaime Alexander is excellent as Nicole, the young girl who finds herself the target of a sadistic killer at a deserted rest stop from hell. Alexander throws herself into the role and carries the movie well; too bad the plot and direction don't live up to her standards. There is no background on the killer's motives, even though he's been at it for almost 40 years; there's no explanation for the bizarre Winnebago family; and it's ending is another one of those ""we can't explain it so just let the audience make up their own explanation."" I relish the days when horror movies' bad guys got their just desserts and the heroes rode off in the sunset; movies like this are indicative of today's pessimistic view on life."
2,So close...,"I came so close to giving this 3 stars, until the ""Twist"" ending that actually made no sense. This was a damn scary, gory horror movie right in line with Saw or Wolf Creek (but similar to ""Joy Ride"" - which is far superior). It's dark, scary and pretty well done for a low budget, straight to dvd movie. The lead, Jamie Alexander is not bad. Her character does make some stupid choices in the move. Yes, there were things that made no sense and it was a little slow at times, but still a good horror movie, until the end, which was not satisfying. Plus, it looked like there was a ton of footage we didn't see in the movie but the only ""deleted"" material are two alternate endings. Almost a hit, but ultimately a miss."
2,More of the same...,"Rest Stop is a pretty bad straight to DVD horror flick. It's the same old ""redneck rampage"" style serial killer flick. But the plot is just in shambles and doesn't make much sense. Only about 20 minutes of this movie is worth seeing. By the way, you know a movie is bad when Joey Lawrence is the best actor in it. I'll give it this much... there are probably two very nasty/awesome gore scenes for the slasher fans out there."
2,Decent generic movie,"This movie wasn't really different from other horror films that have coming out in the hundreds every week. The setting looked like it was a rest stop on the way to the Hewitt House. I swear ive seen the same place in anther movie and surprised that you didnt accidently see anther horror movie being filmed there.As a side note, Im so sick of horror movies that have as a feature an ending that was too scary for theaters. Most of those endings are stupid and this dvd is no different. It looks like it has promise but it fell flat. Also, they have a feature about the people in the RV that looks kind of like a mini sequel. It was an alright movie but nothing id watch again."
2,Allow Me To Save You Some Money...,"Young boyfriend / girlfriend set out on road-trip. They stop at public rest area. Boyfriend disappears w/ sadistic, psycho-hillbilly. Girlfriend spends the night in public toilet, terrorized by psycho-hillbilly. Cop tries to help, ends up dead. Girlfriend runs, screams, etc., etc., etc. THE END..."
5,"Great Reference for Understanding the ""Call"" spiritually to teach","I use this book to instruct teachers on recognizing the call from God. I use it for teachers in the classroom at our bible college, Christian school, and Sunday school."
1,Designer Clothes and Egos,"This is a bad book. I picked this title up with interestbecause I am a sports fan and have a family member in the NFL. What Igot was bad fiction and poor editing. Most of the ""stories"" are loose accounts of make-believe characters based on collections of people. There is more discussion of fashion (Donna Karan hosiery does not slip over you calves) and tales of how cool she thinks she is. If you are a sports fan or want a behind the scenes look do not waste your time with this book. Her excitement for the game is displayed by examples like wanting her husband's team (AFC) to win the Pro Bowl because the $20K will allow her to buy a painting of English dogs for the stairwell. The rest reads like her diary or a trashy novel. You will not glean any insights on the daily life of an NFL wife, the Chicago Bears or the NFL here. If you want a good sports book try ""You're Okay It's Just a Bruise"" by Dr. Huizenga. END"
5,Absolute Must for any Chiapas interest,"I am the author of the ""Adventure Guide to the Yucatan,"" a guidebook to the ruins and sites of Mexico's fascinating peninsula. I have been a fan of Richard Perry and his wife's writing since reading the ""Maya Missions"" book they did on the many ruined colonial missions in the Yucatan. This title is equally worthwhile with vivid descriptions of history and much detail on the colonial remnants of the Spanish church, in seldom-visited Chiapas. And their pen and ink drawings are evocative of the romance and tragedy of the conquest. A great book to make your Chiapas visit even better."
2,Almost but not quite,The size to replace was not right! It I have a three inch in diameter and this just barely covered and slips off! Very aggrevating!
2,Universal it is not,"I purchased this product because of its supposed univeral specs. I have a 3"" cylinder that it does not fit, and I have a 2"" cylinder that it does fit but because of the flange on the cylinder the donut is very difficult to hold in place until it is seated by pressure. I have a 13/4"" cylinder that it fits but then there is no room for except a very small penis which thankfully I don't have.So, it was pretty much a waste of money."
3,Raised the price!!,This used to be $28. I was ready to set up an automatic order every couple weeks but now it is cheaper for me to go to walmart. also emailed cust.serv. about this price raise and no one ever got back to me.Very disapointed
4,Can't beat the price,"Lowest price on these diapers as compared to Babies-R-Us, Walmart, Target. But sometimes delivered can take many weeks depending on inventory. Overall best value, but may have to buy a smaller pack from Target due to delay in shipping."
2,Doesn't fit baby's bottom very well.,"My in-law bought me Huggies diaper before my son was born. Ever since then I just always used Huggies. I've been happy with Huggies but I thought maybe I should try other brands to see if there is a difference. I bought Pampers and I was not happy with it. The back side of the diaper is not as stretchy as Huggies. I would put it on as snug as I could while my son is lying down but as soon as he stands up, there is plenty of room in the backside. It makes it very easy for poop to spill out from the waist.And as my son crawls and sits down, the diaper even once started sliding down dangerously low.The only thing worth 2 stars about it is Pampers is cheaper than Huggies."
4,My personal best,"I would have given the CD a 5 star rating except for ""Secret of my Success."" The rest of the album is well done and I never get tired of listening to it."
4,Don't hate me because I'm beautiful..,"Unquestionably, a most maligned release by Night Ranger [in my opinion, unfairly]. This has been termed over-produced and wimpy, but I disagree. The sound was indeed embellished by the hand of David Foster [keyboard god, westcoast music guy, responsible for early-80s Chicago & Tubes, and probably many other things], but I still hear plenty of energy & distorted, harmonizing guitar-duels between Brad & Jeff, and the passion of the band's youthful angst is still there. There's no argument that for the price at which most retailers are offering this disc, you cannot afford to pass it up.. It's quintessential [in my opinion, at the very least]..'Carry On'.."
2,Could have been better,"This book has some very nice pictures in it, but it is lacking a lot. Its really disorganized into a art deco mismash. The art deco movement was so huge, its hard to place into an entire book, but there are somethings I would have liked to see in here. Some of the buildings in Los Angeles which has some amazing art deco architecture. The author completely skips over designers like Russell Wright and Walter Von Nessen. There there are things that plain just don't fit in here, there are many Moderne buildings, which is close, but not exactly deco, there is a random page on 1930's fashion and a whole section of 1980's art deco reproductions. I don't want to see reproductions, I want to see the real thing! I wish more would have been put in about buildings in America, but I understand this book was published in the UK."
1,frustrating,"I purchased this mainly to get Lean On Me. I viewed the DVD and found it contained Stand and Deliver only. There was only one DVD in the packet, so I thought there might be a main menu to select the movie that I wanted to see. After Stand and Deliver was over, there was a menu, but it was only to view Stand and DEliver again. I tried flipping the DVD over, but it did not work. I notified Amazon about this, and the promptly sent me another copy. It was exactly the same. I ended up having to mail both copies back to Amazon. They refunded me only partially of what I initially paid. I don't understand this, as I did not get the product I thought I was purchasing. It indeed was false advertising."
4,Stand and Deliver with Lean on ME,"This combination DVD is an excellent educational tool that may inspire your students. I suggest having a classroom discussion after students have viewed the film to help them understand how it relates to their school experiences. Even though these films were made a few decades ago, the issues are still relevant today."
4,According to the reviews....,"I see more than one review here saying that this copy is done totally on one disc. That would not be a problem with me as long as both features were on the disc somehow, but the listing says this as a two disc set. If it does not truly have two physical discs, then that is very misleading."
5,review,I love this movie. It got her fast and was very goodThis is a great movie I would recomend it
5,2 great movies 1 low price.,"These were two great inspirational movies, based on true events. Amazon had the best deal on time. At their price you can't go worng."
1,Voces Horrible,Me llamo la atencion este CD para mis hijos pero es de los peores engaños para el publico. No son los cantantes originales sino unos niños que no saben cantar y unos adultos que estan peores que los niños. Los temas que escogieron para esta coleccion no son todos apropiados para niños (ej. La Vida Loca) Mejor comprales un CD de Mozart para niños.
5,Watch out Lorraine Hansberry,"I am a big fan of Lorraine Hansberry and will always have the utmost respect for this strong black woman writer. Yet, after reading Crumbs from the table of Joy, Poof and Mud, Stones and River I fell in love with the words Lynn Nottage pours into her works. Crumbs especially, leaves me with tears evertime I read the last monologue Erinstine delievers. Nottage's has a way of making this world seem so real and making one wanting to reach out and cry or comfort each character. I think she is on her way to the top."
1,"Not bad, for a Beta version","This product has the look of a Beta version released on an unsuspecting public. Any time my wife can not use a product without system failures, the product is not worth recommending. I am an 'puter tech, and her system works fine - Cook'n works poorly. Also, as noted by others, the recipes are not special, the database is underdeveloped, and the images included are essentially useless. Good marketing, bad product (Marketing are misleading, or we could call them lies.)"
5,Just like the picture!,"If you like the picture, you will like these cuff links! They are represented very accurately. They are attractive, simple, modern, and light in weight. Very satisfied. Bought them for my fiance for our wedding. He loved them!"
3,Does not include case,"The product is five star. This three star review relates solely to this Amazon.com listing, which shows the micrometer set in a case. The 124A DOES NOT COME WITH A CASE. To get the case you need to get the 124AZ."
5,Great Korean Drama,"a ""Must Have"" if you are a Jo In-sung fan.He is wonderful in this drama!Though aired in 2002, it's still works today.I enjoyed the story very much.I am Very Happy with my purchase.the english subtitles are excellent."
4,Shoot for the Stars,"I love the three main male characters, they're really very talented in portraying their roles. For the female lead, she's not my type to be the love-life of Jo In Sun, he's so cute."
2,Starting Out? Yeahhh Right.....,"With all do respect to the author, this book is not well written. I got this book to actually learn the Grunfeld. Well It turns out I waisted my money. When I explored the Grunfeld a little more, i found out that it is a worthless opening. I now play the Modern Benoni. The Modern Benoni is excellent for agressive players and if you want to learn the opening I recommend Starting Out: The Modern Benoni. Ive had great success with this opening. Now back to the Grunfeld. The Grunfeld is bad because it lets white get a strong central advantage for no reason at all. Ive also found a few errors in this book. The variations are not well explained so your pretty much on your own the figure them out. So, Please save your money."
2,This book made me cancel my trip to Cameroon,This book describes Cameroon as the armpit of Africa. Seriously. It said that. At least 1/3 of the book is on all the different types of diseases one is sure to catch being there. It says that Cameroon is unique in that there is a type of malaria that will KILL you in 24 hours of the first symptom. This book scared me so much that I went to Egypt alone instead of going with my friends to Cameroon. There arent really any books just on Cameroon. Lonely Planet has one on West Africa which I should have gotten. My friends went and had a wonderful time. The book should have talked about the good things this country has- which as it turns out there are other things there that Malaria! Perhaps if I would of read a different book then I would have not canceled my flight to Cameroon.
5,Great!,Touchy-feely books are great! My son loves them! These are well put together and he loves to go back and forth between pages!
4,Great book,"My 1 year old son loves this book and the different textures. The only thing that could be better are more words or a story. All that the book keeps saying is ""That's not my Dinosaur."" But over all it's worth the money!"
5,Attention Grabber,"My daughter is 10 months old and loves this book. It is the only one she doesn't try to close before the end. Simple, bright colors, nice thick pages and keeps her interest. She loves feeling the different textures on each page. She chooses this book over all her other ones. All the books by this author are very similar but we have two of them anyway."
5,My daughter love the That's Not My... books!,These are great my daughter has loved these since she was 7 months old each page has a different thing to touch and the whole book is just the right size for her. We also play where is the mouse as there is a mouse on each page :)
4,Beautiful book,"Not my daughter's favourite book of the collection but quite a good one, very colourful."
1,not good for the money,Speakers and sound quality are less than desirable. You can not wake to attached music device - only radio. Simply not worth the investment.
2,Not Exactly a Towering Intellect,This guy talks like a moron and goes on insane digressions. He seems like a hillbilly more than anything. He made very few interesting points about Nietzsche. Waste of time.
2,Incomplete !,Graphics are fine but the game play is below average. Needs to be programmed for more convenient play.
2,Hard to follow,This book is somewhat interesting. It is written at a level which seems to skim over everything. The way it is written is also very hard to follow.
4,Handy,"Used this tool on a weekend trip and was glad I had it. I didn't really need all the tools but none the less, a great little tool to have. The hammer worked better than I thought."
3,Nice multi tool,"I bought this on a whim when I had some extra money I didn't need, or thought so at the time anyway, and wanted to get my end of the world, emergency, just in case something bad happens I don't want to be without kit done all at once. This product is ok, not greatly made not entirely useful, but it'll do in a pinch and it's small and light enough to stuff in a bag."
5,Dad thought it was awesome!,"My brother picked this out for my dad for father's day. My dad thought it was great, and my brother was so jealous of the gift he picked out, that I got him one for his birthday! It was a win, win all around!"
2,Poor quality issues,"I purchased two of these ""premium"" hammer tools. Both of which have fallen apart. The first had the wooden handle fall off and the second had the spring that opens the pliers come unglued. Both are very stiff and difficult to operate. The blades are too tight and holding the tool to remove nails/staples can give you a good blister if you don't wear gloves. I guess for the price and considering it's made in China it's acceptable."
5,detoxreview,"I found the book clearly and well written.It does exactly what it says on the cover.I have learnt from the book, I have reviewed over 50health books and this is the only one that I could givefive stars to.Nobody reading this is going to hurt themselves, the advice given is excellent, and has already after ju7st 2 weeks benefitted greatly 3 patients here."
1,Just OK,I am a health major and a lot of the information that is listed in this book is common knowledge. Yeah you shouldn't eat a lot of sugar or caffiene because it will make you feel bad. I read through this book several times and even though the information is useful for living a healthy lifestyle there is not a lot of information regarding what steps should be taken to detox completely. I do think however the food lists about what juices will work for what are interesting and I have tried those but other then that not too much in depth info here. At the end of the chapters there are guidlines for detoxing from substances and a lot of the information is simple stuff that is mentioned in nutritional textbooks as well as the Dietary guidelines for americans. If you want a book that is going to go in more detail about detox I would not recommend this one.
4,Picked this one up on a whim,"I'm a more-or-less fan of Palatini. The stuff of hers I like, I love. The stuff of hers I'm so-so about... well, it's just apathy all around. *shrugs*But this one was just $2, so I picked up a copy and crossed my fingers.It's not my *favorite* of her books (that'd be Lousy Rotten Stinkin' Grapes), but it's sure a good one! This is a funny, punny variation on Chicken Little, with earthquakes instead of acorns and ducks instead of chicks. It *does* have Palatini's standard sarcasm-laden characters, so if you're trying to make every book sweetness and light for your kids, pass this one by. (But if that's the case, do you really want one where a major plot point is that one critter wants to eat the others? Seriously?)Otherwise, I recommend this one highly."
5,Accessory shelf,"This is a great product. However, now I have a tendency to put more and more ""stuff"" on it like ChopSaver, valve oil, slide grease, pencils, eyeglasses. No more having to put a little bag by my chair. Woo hoo!"
2,Interferes with turning pages,"I was disappointed by this item. As mentioned by others it is a cheap plastic extrusion. Not previously mentioned is that it has longitudinal ribs that interfere with turning the pages of one's music book. I ended up moving it from the music stand's bottom lip to the top edge, hanging over the back, where it can still hold pencils (and my Korg tuner) but does not interfere with turning pages. My hope is that it can remain in that position when I acquire a music stand lamp."
2,Doesn't fit on all stands,"This appears to be a useful accessory, but it does not fit on a music stand with a rolled edge. The material is somewhat flexible so I thought I might be able to force it on, but it just pops right off again."
3,Didn't work as well as I had hoped,"This is a nice idea; however, I kept knocking it off the stand. I finally had to remove it. It would take a while to get used to, and maybe in time I would. However, the location of the shelf is where one would often grab the stand. It is made of a hard rubber or plastic type substance rather than metal . . . no big deal, just different than I thought when I purchased it."
5,midwifery and homebirth is a no-brainer after this book,This is one of the books that convinced me of the lack of true science or even logic in obstetrical care and hospital birth. There are lots of studies reviewed and statistics analyzed. Every bit of this book is fascinating and all the references are provided. There are arguments and rebuttals with logic clearly weighing heavily in favor of midwifery and homebirth. It is essential reading for anyone worried about taking the responsibility of the outcome of their birth in their own hands.
2,"Well writen, but silly.","This book, although well writen and incredibly cited, is a joke. The bible was not meant to be taken literally. This book quotes the book that was written by humans and has a whole lot of contradictions. I think you would have to be very dim (or baptist) to admit the bible as your moral foundation. Read about Jerhico. Read Genesis Chapters 1-3. If you still think this is a good book to base your morality on, take an IQ test."
5,GREAT BREYER HORSE!,"I am 14 years old, ........this is a great collectible, I am a breyer collector with over 60 horses, this is one of my most unique, you should get this while you can, this is extreemly hard to find, so BUY IT! but breyer horses should NOT be given to kids under 8 because they are fragile and they are easy to break."
1,rocket mania,"Doesn't work, Window vista, and you can load only on one computer. I have more than one in my home."
3,Save your patience for something better,"I never understood why, of all slow-moving independent films, these three are so prized. They are so self-consciously full of little symbols pointing every which way that they feel more like a filmmaking exercise and less like a work of art. Yes, Kieslowski's skill and expertise are admirable. But in the end, even at the supposedly powerful concluding moment, it all rings somewhat academic and hollow. If you are looking for moving, patient filmmaking in French, try Jean de Florette instead."
2,Too Hard for Beginners,"I have Bonnie Franklin's Let's Tap and, to me, she is a much better teacher than Ginger. Bonnie demonstrates facing you and does the steps totally backwards (her left leg for your right, so it is like looking in a mirror -- quite impressive) and it is so much easier to follow. Ginger initially shows the steps facing away from you so you can't see what her feet are doing. For someone who doesn't know a fl-lap from a shuffle, it is very difficult to figure out what she is doing. When she does turn around for the faster sections, her legs are opposite yours. Also, the music is quite bad. NOT for beginners! An advanced tap dancer might get a lot out of it though."
4,Tap with Ginger,"This is a good DVD for beginners who have had a little instruction already. There is a lot of slow repetition but not much dialogue about how to produce the best sound and it is difficult to hear her taps in the beginner's section. I thought the music could have been mixed up more as it is a slower jazzy big band sound throughout. Overall, The value (beginner through advanced) is there and she puts steps together in practice reviews. The camera shots are close ups from the back so it is easy to see what she is doing and then the reviews are full body from the back. I like the advanced part the best even though my skill level is lower as it was challenging but manageable."
1,"Poor Instruction, Poor Production","It's at best a tap dictionary. The instructor is like a machine - counting, showing and repeating the moves in exactly the same format in all chapters, without identifying challenging parts that needs more explanation. She simply doesn't tell you what to pay attention or what to take special care, which is essential for learners trying to imitate the moves.Production quality wise, sound quality is bad, which makes it even harder to understand the instructor with an accent. The music is boring."
3,Tap with Ginger series,"It's an excellent ""how to video source"", despite of the fact that the music used in the step series usually don't match the step itself."
2,Not Great,"I found this DVD difficult to follow and quickly got left behind in the Beginners segment, even though I have been doing classes for about 6 months. The presenter does not explain what the step involves, she just does them and expects you to be able to copy her. I also think she goes too fast too soon."
3,"Good, but not iphone compatible","Great product, fast shipping, solid build quality. This works great with my 5g iPod, but audio out does not work with the iPhone."
2,Line Out Distorts,"This is a handy little cable but the line out is too powerful and causes distortion, especially with bass. My wife has a Monster cable that essentially does the same thing and it does not cause the distortion (although the Monster cable is not very durable.) I guess I will have to keep looking for a solution."
1,Not what I expected,"I tap danced when I was younger, (I am 22 now) and have recently decided I wanted to get back into dance so I purchased this tape as a refresher course. As soon as I turned it on I realized this tape was not what I expected. I dont feel that the instructor explains the steps enough, she performs them but gives you no direction as to how to do them. In looking at the DVD cover and this performers website (www.ginger-de-paris.com) it looks extremely unprofessional and this look comes across in the DVD also. The performer is standing on a small piece of tapping floor and is definitly not in a studio. The price for this DVD is outrageous and I was expecting much more out of it. I gave it about 10 minutes of play time but couldnt bear to go on from there."
4,A great refresher and new instructional product,"I recommend this product to both first time tap dancers and tap dancers wanting to refresh or continue learning more advanced steps. Ginger goes through each lesson step by step, then with counts, and then once more with music....all of which are very helpful in learning the timing and feel of the moves once the move is learned.The only thing preventing me from rating this product with 5 stars, is the fact that when she is instructing the Shim Sham (Part 1) she says ""shuffle, step, step"" but when she performs the move with music she actually does ""shuffle, ball change"", which are very different actions. So there are times when she is inconsistant with what she says and what she actually does.I think the Zoot CD is a nice added bonus, if you like jazz style music, because it makes you want to get up and dance!"
1,Isn't worth anything,"This game is a major upset.I bought it immediatly when it cameout and played it twice.It was suppose to beat falcon 4.0 but it isn'teven close.Falcon 4.0 is the closest game to real life.When i played f-18 the handleing of the aircraft was inpossible to real life,it moves way to easy.Also the cockpit is a disgrace of a plane,it is so horrible.I just wish i could get my money back because it was a major waste.If your looking for a great flight sim i suggest falcon 4.0 because it is so accurate and graphic,eventhough you need the patches.The game is way ahead of its time. END"
1,DO NOT GET IT,Do not get f/A-18. The views are all stupid. The grapics Are very Bad. IF you want to get a High quality game Get U.S. Air Force better known as USAF
5,Great Naval Aviation Sim,So you want to fly a Navy Jet but you don't have the time... no problem just buy this gameIn this game you fly the F/A 18 E/F superhornet which is s navy jet take off the carrier shoot a few bandits turn back call the ball and land. Sound exiting well if it is from Jane's it's got to be.Sure its not as good as USAF but that was a once in a lifetime game.
1,Not compatable with Window's 7,I was excited to get this game until I loaded it and it wouldn't run properly with my Window's 7 oper system
2,A Step Backwards?,"After playing FA/18, I expected to see an awesome addition to the excellence achieved by USAF. FA/18 doesn't come close. The graphics seem to be equal to some shareware products, compared to USAF, and the game doesn't capture the feeling of realism that USAF did. I guess if it had come out before USAF, it probably would have impressed me more. It appears to be F15 reincarnated, staged in a different theatre. The carrier take offs and landings are ok, but even the older Microprose F14 Fleet defenders' carrier activity appeared more exciting. It's definately not what I expected to take the stage after USAF. I was somewhat of a disappointed to me. If you're just dying to catapult from a carrier, at least wait several months, this way you can pick it up in a clearance bin for $19.99."
3,Jane's Only Short-Coming,"When I read that this awesome new product by Electronic Arts was coming out, I couldn't help but be excited, knowing, that it HAS to be greater than USAF. I was wrong. It installed quickly and disapppointed me even quicker, realizing that I just bought the F15 all over again, just a different plane, different theater. This is fine... ...if it was 1997. The overall graphics are okay and the carriers landings are an improvement over other flight simulations, but the cockpit graphics, flight manual and aircraft handling are upsetting, letting you know that this latest edition to Jane's was a rushed job. My recommendation is to hold off on getting this, look at the number of disappointed flight sim jockeys and wait for Jane's to get their act together before trying to sell us a $40 dessert after a full course meal of an excellent, well-reviewed ""USAF""."
5,Listen! This is the best sim.... period...,"You'll read about poor graphics and slow frame rate. If you have the hardware this is what you should buy... The most realistic sim you will find. You won't get the USAF kind of sim, you will get the real stuff, ok, the graphics are not that good, but the game is really exciting, you will love it... of course it from jane's. Just don't think you will get a novaligic or a USAF secual, this is very diffrent. I recomend you try it, you just need more than 400 mhz. I have an atholon 600 and a banshee and I love the way it runs."
1,a story of self pity,"If you wish to read of Picasso this is not the book for you. It is a story of self pity. It sickened me. I am angry that I spent the money on this poorly written drivel. Let me sum it up for you; ""Poor me poor me poor me. Grandpa ignored me, poor me"" Save your money. Do not buy this book."
2,A bitter bitter memoir,"Although I feel sorry for Marina Picasso, her brother and her life, I think that maybe this memoir should have stayed between herself and her psychiatrist. Not only is the story badly written, the author leaves out large portions of her life. Even though she is a grown woman, the book is written from the perspective of a little girl. Everyone except her and her brother are self centered and not a little bit evil. This book might have done wonders for her psyche, but it should never have been printed."
1,An Ego Trip,I dislike any author that has no integrity. She bleats incessantly about not wanting to belong to the Picasso family but nonetheless cashes in with this book. No matter where we are born with enough intelligence and stamina we can better our lives. I don't like moaners!
2,Not about Pablo Picasso,"If you want to know more about the artist, about his work, about his art... this is not the book you are looking for. The author, is always complainig about the fact that Picasso was not a good grandfather, and that she wanted to have a ""grandpa"". Luckily for her, this guy was Picasso, so this gave her the best excuse to write a book. She says little about him. She speaks too much about her and her fears in life."
1,Shoot me now.,"Ugh! This book is so depressing. All you see are glimpses of Picasso through the bitter eyes of an adult, who feels that is necessary that we all hear about her awful childhood and the monstrous Minotaur that Picasso was. Not to mention the writing is so lacking in depth that the book does not hold your focus. Plus, she is so whiney, that you feel like she is just trying to make money of the name of Picasso. What a disappointment this book was."
2,[...],When I read this book I was 11. I would not say it the grest book in the world. But I think kids who have parents in the navy or army or something like that would proble injoy this book. It was ok book. It is about this girl and her mom is going out to fight in the war. And her mom's boyfriend that she dis likes is take care of her and her baby borther and her mom's boyfriend don't know much about kids. And she mad at her mom for leave her with him. And she regreats she not nicer to her mom when she leaft.
3,Too Easy,"The only good ones were the expert ones, and even they were too easy. If you want a challenge, not something mindless, then get the NY Times Acrostics, or the NY Times Sunday Variety Puzzles, which includes acrostics, diagramless, etc."
2,Too easy,"If you're a nut for acrostics, you know part of the fun is that they're HARD. You worry the puzzle for awhile -- sometimes days -- trying to guess words from letter sequences, seeing a phrase take shape, eventually experiencing that ""Aha!"" moment that lets your pencil or pen fly back and forth from puzzle to clues until the answer emerges.Unless you're very new to acrostics, you'll find this collection much too easy. I could fill in 99% of the clues right away, and there's no challenge in that.It takes an astonishing amount of imagination, artistry and technique to create a good acrostic; too bad the pickings these days are so slim.(Henry Rathvon's acrostics are better than these, but he hasn't published anything new in awhile; Thomas Middleton, the undisputed master of the acrostic, has been gone for years, alas.)"
5,I buy this book for every new parent!,"The Portable Pediatrician is the most neutral, common sense guide and reference to raising children (and I've read them all)!! It gives the basics, from how formulas are different to what to expect of your two year old. It also provides the most comprehensive and understandable outline of illnesses, what they are, why they may or may not be dangerous and HOW TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT of the seriousness of the illness! This is a must have reference book that every parent should own!!"
1,Don't use if child is sick!,This book is full of unnecessary information - No suggestions for basic things like a fever! my child registered 103.7 at midnight - treatment ideas were very limited and lots of paragraphs on temperature taking techniques - and references to heat stroke and potential convulsions. misses the mark on other areas too.
5,Waechtersbach Christmas dishes,We are very happy with the Sugar and Creamer.They were a replacement for ones that were nearly 20 years (the lid on the sugar broke). The color is true to the rest of our Waechtersbach Christmas dish set. The company shipped everything quickly.Thank you
2,Darin 1936-1973,"I was very disappointed with this CD. Only 10 songs and they are nearly all on other albums. Would not buy this were I not an avid BD collector! However, it came promptly and was as represented."
5,A surprising find!,"For the cost of a cab ride from chelsea to the bronx, I was transported away to a Magical Paradise. Thank you Janaan, thank you!"
3,almost stinko,"Here's the deal, Chuckleheads:This DVD-R is just that -- burned off heavens-knows-what print and packed in a smelly DVD case from heavens-knows-where. That's where my problem begins: how can you charge a premium price for an un-premium product? I like the idea of making low-market DVDs available, but do it right, yes?"
1,No Substance,This was another book that I coouldn't finish. It had no substance to it what so ever. Take away the sex and you have nothing. Don't bother with it.
1,"Bad history, I can deal with. Bad sex? Not so much.","This book....look, if you're into pseudo-historical romances with an overt flavor of rape fantasy, this book is for you. I'm all for historical romances, but I'd prefer something where the author put in a bit of effort on re-creating at least the feel of the place and time, and not just 'I saw a Western movie once.'The sex scenes made me actually uncomfortable. I mean, first he strips her against her will, then he physically pushes her down and tells her to try and fight him, and when she actually BITES him, he calls her a bitch and then forces himself into her. And then the author spends two pages describing how much Dee doesn't like the pain. That is NOT sexy, and it's not romantic. It's rapefantasy. And that's just not my kink."
2,Retro male on the rampage,"This book reflects the period in which it was written. (Note: It is set in the old west) In the 70's, women were still confused about how much freedom we wanted, and sometimes escaped into a classic bodice ripper, where men ruled and we didn't have to make choices. This is one of those books, which unfortunately leaves a bad taste in the mouth of thinking women today. The hero is an ass, and the heroine should have shot him in the cojones with his own gun for the way he treats her."
2,My least Favorite Linda Howard story,I usually find myself drawn into the characters & plots that Linda develops but in this case the characters were just not believable or even very likable. I found the subplot characters (Tillie & Kyle) to be far more interesting than the main characters. I hope newcomers to Linda Howard are NOT influenced by this book.... give her another chance because she's MUCH better than this book would indicate.
2,Frustrating Characters,"I usually love Linda Howard, but the female character just drives me crazy in this book. She is extremely stubborn and makes the male character give up all of his dreams based on her fears. No compromise. Sorry, this is not my cup of tea."
2,Angel Creek a bit dried up,"I love Linda Howard. I have read every book of hers in print and it's a happy day when a new one comes out.I bought this one when it first came out, and being a die hard fan, I've even re-read it. But it is far from her best book, and there is a scene at the end, just before the hero, Lucas, realises how wrong he's been, that is down right disturbing.Dee is a good heroine, in that she is tough and smart and hardworking, but Lucas is not as good a hero. I think Howard's contemporaries are better than her Westerns, and that this is her weakest Western.If you absolutely have to have it, then buy it, but otherwise, try another - she's a great writer, but this one sinks..."
5,Good Antenna,This antenna came as advertised. If using this antenna for a GPS 60Csx you will need the MCX to BNC adapter cable.
5,Editorial review from Booklist,"This is an excellent beginner tape for tap enthusiasts. Ginger teaches 15 different basic steps such as Shuffle, Flaps, Cramp Roll, Clap Step, Comic Slide, The famous Shim Sham Routine, Broadway Time Step, Rhythm Time Step, Time Step Slide, Turning Time Step, Basic Roll and Essence.Put your shoes on and have fun learning Tap with this close up and full body from the back shots. Every step is repeated 4 times and then reviewed 3 times with music. The Tap dictionary defining common steps appears at the end of the tape, is an added useful tool as well as reviews after each set of five steps. Highly recommended program for librairies and dance collections."
5,excellent reasonably priced introduction to tap,"Review from Library Journal:"" In this beginner, intermediate &advanced tap dance videos, Tap artist adheres to the concept"" practice makes perfect"". First each step is demonstrated to music, often accompagnied by an explanation of its use or origin. Next, it is shown in close-ups of the feet from the back as Ginger first calls the footwork, then counts the beats. In most cases little rewinding is necessary. Each of the 3 tapes contains 15 steps. A tap dictionary defines common terms appear at the end of each tape. The footwork close-ups are packed with the visual & rhythmic information that can be more difficult to pick up during dance classes. This is an excellent reasonably priced introduction to tap. Highly recommended"""
1,Problem with seller standing behind their product.,"The product was shipped to me in a plastic bag with a mailing label stuck to it. Upon opening the plastic bag, I found the item had been crushed and broken, aparently during shipping.I contacted the seller the next day and was told to send the item back and they would ship me another one. The product was sent back to them, at my expense, one month ago today. I have yet to receive the replacement product."
1,Poorly constructed,"It wouldn't hold my iPhone 3G, which kept sliding off. The spring arm mechanism was broken within 10 minutes. The price was cheap enough, but as they say, you get what you pay for. It went in the trash the first day."
5,"""GTA2"" the best game for computers","Dear customers if you want to buy a good game I would suggest that you get ""GTA2"" it is the best game ever your free you can do what ever you want from jacking cars to runing away from the police to geting into gangs.WHat I want to say is that this is the only game that is a fun and cool game.Also you get to go on the train while the police are chashing you,and run-over peaple and ofvcourse shoot peaple so if you want to get a fun game get this one thank you for your time."
4,Great! One of my favorites!,This game is alsome! I love it.Gameplay 5/5Great! Fun since I bought it!Graphics 1/5Why is it birds eye view?Cars 2/5They should put real cars.overall 4/5Good game! worth [money]
3,I dont think you will like this game,Its fun for the first 5 hours but it gets really boring really fast. The graphics are poor and theres no real plot or storyline to it. Its very annoying to have cops on your tail and its really hard to get the the next level. The entire game is filled with pointless pictures of people pointing guns at you just to fill up space. Its a pretty cheap.
3,PC gamer age 14,"I did not really like this game. I liked it very much the first 2 hours but then it got very boring. The graphics are terrable compared to games of today and there isint much of a storyline behind the game. The law enforcement gets on you for every crime you commit but some NPC can steal a car right in front of the cops and they wouldint care. They are really annoying. You have to use up alot of cash to save a game and I also find that everyone I meet cusses at me which is annoying too. The biggest problem of this game is it is incredibly hard to find your way to the church, automotive repair center, etc. And when your not playing and you're just in the play game, quit, options menu they put up these pictures of people looking at you with guns or something just to take up space its really stupid."
5,JUST READ THIS!,"If you like action, ultra-violence, super-speed and bad language, then this is definetly the game for you. Travel around in a ""living metropolis"" by foot or by car, and carry out jobs for seven different gangs using an array of weapons among other things. Learn to earn the respect of each gang, and jobs will be offered. But be careful, because in the land of GTA 2, enemies are easily made. Throw in the ability to steal any vehicle in the city (over 120 different vehicles), from firetrucks to ice-cream vans, and you've got one of the best damn games on the PC. Not only is GTA 2 fun, but it also has LOADS of replay value, so you'll never be bored! Don't just sit there! GET IT NOW! A copy has your name on it!"
4,Simply Fun as Hell!,"Let me sum this up for ya in 3 Words,FUN AS HELL!This game is very addivcate and very fun (duh).The Graphics are just complety fresh and the gameplay is smooth as a baby's bottom.If your thinking you should buy this,BUY IT you will be not dissapointed.There over 100+ missions for you do to do,and the depth is incredible by itself,over 200 cars to hijack including a TANK from the amry.Watch Gang Warfare before your eyes as they shoot each other.Great AI makes this a very challenging game.Agian another Great and Soild Fun game"
3,GREAT GAME BUT....,This is a great game but it gets old way to fast. It isnt worth the money if it was cheaper i would say buy it because despite how boring it gets it is fun for about the first month. The graphics are descent and the lack of plot doesnt really matter because its fun enough just shooting things and stealing cars. So i say wait for the price to go down then buy it
3,Fun game,"Don't let the three stars fool you, this is a really fun game, like when you go on a crime spree it's fun to shoot everything in sight :). It's just that the game is nowhere close to being as good as GTA 3 or GTA Vice City will be (I just know it) This game is really fun but don't be looking for a GTA 3, this game is worth the 20 bucks it's sold for at most stores... but dont' buy it for anymore"
5,Grand Theft Auto Stole My Eye,"I Played Grand Theft Auto 2 And It Is The Coolest Game Since Pong. The High Definition Levels And The Graphics Make This My Pick Of The Year. The Most Fun Is Getting To Grab Any Car You Want And Getting To Fight For Respect In Gangs. With 3 Levels And 75 Missions, This Game Will Steal You Too."
3,"Ehh.. so so, ok, nominal, moderate, fair","This game is no GTA 3 i tell ya. I grew up on this game so i have a weird bond with it. But if you are going to it looking for something just as good as GTA 3, go else where. Same name, but if you haven't been playing the games from the start, this one is not for you. It must have the coolest intro scene ever. It is live action footage filmed with a guy that looks just like the guy in GTA3. it was filmed in SF. I left GTA 2 for GTA3. And then, there was no going back. I would reccomend this game for true diehard fans, but not very many other people. Yes, it is a classis, just like GTA 3. I say, those people at Rockstar sure know what their doing. The System requirements are so low, i could play it on my 4 year old Fujitsu Lifebook! Its fun, with a good story line. The graphics are so outdated. But after you get into the game, it is a lot of fun. It is a gamble, You will either love it or ya wont"
4,"Fun game, as long as you don't have XP","This is a great game as long as you don't have Windows XP. Aparently this game isn't made for XP, it still works untill you try to go to certain places. Then your computer crashes! If you don't have XP, I recomend this game. But I think it would be okay for kids to play, the graphics aren't good enough to give it ""graphic violence"". So if you don't mind ""birds eye view"", this game is pretty good. You can also play online in tag team matches and stuff. I recomend this game unless you have 50 bucks to get Grand Theft Auto 3 or Vice City. Just for the record, i'm 13, the review form only goes to 12."
2,Utterly disappointing,"After reading the reviews for this book, I was anxious to start reading it right away. Unfortunately,I returned the book the same day I received it. I am in the process of starting a bookkeeping business out of my home and Mr. Lewis's book did not help at all. As I skimmed the book I quickly realized that he prefers tax accounting and a commercial office environment. If you are looking for an overview for setting up shop as a tax accountant, with employees, in an office this book will be perfect.If you want particulars on starting a home based bookkeeping business keep looking."
1,Fundamental,"The book may well apply for beginning many administrative type businesses, not just bookkeeping services. Extremely fundamental in presentation. It is not written for enlightened professional accountants wishing to expand their bookkeeping services."
2,"Somewhat useful, but Dated","This book was somewhat useful, but emphasized taxes and a larger business (with office space) too much. It also seems dated.Michelle L. Long, CPA, MBAAuthor of:Successful QuickBooks Consulting: The Comprehensive Guide to Starting and Growing a QuickBooks Consulting BusinessAdvanced Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisorMember of Intuit's Certified Trainer Network"
2,Expensive shipping not necessary,"Product is okay. I did think their shipping cost was extremely steep for such a tiny product. Its only a tiny .5 oz jar and it arrived in a fairly large square cardboard box, and was costly to ship. Plus it took about a week to get here. I ordered a digital camera the same day from another guy and it was here in two days. The camera cost less to ship than a .5 oz bottle of eye cream. A camera!! So I was not impressed with their service. Not at all."
4,Cute and Funny,"I really liked these four episodes, but I personally think Karinka got a little soft in these episodes. The first one is when Saki becomes a movie star. In the second one, Karinka get's a love letter (awwwwwww!), third one Karumi becomes a women (haha!), and the last one is when a whole group of angels wants to fight Karumi for a kiss from Nakahito! The last one is my personal favorite. Great DVD. I recommend it."
3,nice design. small size. minimal luster.,very nice design. the flaws are inherent with the metal itself. precious (expensive) metal --> have to make it small (which can disappear in your cuff). not much luster.
1,Save your money.,This Item was not as nice as it appeared online. Smaller and lighter in weight than they appeared to be in the ad.
3,"A little too loud, but better than radio","I needed an alarm clock that would wake up my four year old and make her smile. Since she loves Dora, I thought this would be perfect - hearing Dora's voice saying ""Vamonos"" is much better than Mommy saying ""time to get up"". The problem I have with this clock is that the Dora wake up call is very loud - it actually scares my daughter when it goes off! The volume dial only controls the radio, it does not control ""Dora"". We've taped something over the speaker in the back to quiet it down, but it is still very loud."
4,"Upbeat, but pleasant","I'm not the hugest classical afficianado, but this CD is very appealing. I bought the first in the series, Strengthen the Mind, and found mostly the same old crap on it that I had on three other Mozart CDs.Not the case with this one. Very cool, very different. Not the stereotypical, cliche Mozart. Not good for reading to, but very good for chillin' or in the car."
5,A Pair of Red Clogs to be republished!,Purple House Press is reissuing A Pair of Red Clogs in the late fall of 2002! Same great story and pictures in a hardcover edition.
2,I love to Lindy,"I started dancing about 6 months ago. I was really excited about the dance. It is fun and energetic! Well, I had to move and could no longer take the local swing classes I was attending. So, I bought this tape. Just comparing them to the professional swing dancers at a swing camp I went to in California, their knowledge was minimal and sloppy. Overall, I was disappointed with the video. I did though find videos later that the professional at that camps made. They were wonderful. Overall, if your looking for a tape that teaches you a style that is good for dancing to very RETRO music and you are NOT expecting to make swing dancing a long-term hobby, I recommend this video. But, if you want to dance to the good ole big band music and lindy like they did in the 40's, I recommend a different video than this."
4,I give it a B-,Its a good video but only 1/3 is only single step and 2/3 on triple step moves. other than that its worth the money being asked.
2,"Lots of moves, but they forgot to teach them","There's a ton of moves on this video and it seems like you'd get quite a bit out of it - well, actually you could if you were just into mimicking others on the dance floor and you already knew how to Swing. I couldn't believe the speed at which they were going through the moves - one then another then another with virtually no instruction. There was also very little in the way of leading and following. Not a good value if you ask me."
1,Beginner to Advanced????,"This video is longer than the average dance intructional DVD, but the material is almost all trivial--there are no patterns presented that could legitimately be described as above advanced beginner level, and there are only two or so that are as sophisticated as that.I kept waiting as one trivial pattern after another was introduced and demonstrated over and over again--when would the intermediate and advance patterns be presented? The answer turned out to be ""there are none."""
4,Very Good,My husband and I have taken dance lessons and we love this dvd. We have picked up many new moves. They show the man's part and then the women's part and then put them together for you.
1,stupid,to campy for my tastes could not even focus on the dance steps because of the horrible costumes total wast of money for me
1,Pretty but problems,"The valves were in wrong, the oil was missing, and the paint started chipping within a week. Best yet, the sound is horrible. Save your money and buy used."
2,crap,"valves stick, spit valve broke 1st week, paint peeling 2nd week. zipper on case broke first day. spend your money on better product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,incomplete package,"dear friends the package is incomplete only brings a rubber mat wireless electricity to circulate the carpet is just a rubber, do not bring the part where the battery is connected"
1,Didn't work for cat,This did not work for our cat he just was able to step on it between the electrode lines or just jump over it.nso we never used this dummy mat.
4,good,"I have just had the mat for a week or so, and so far I think is working. I wish it was a bit longer, because one of my cats manages to sit next to it."
5,A great tool to block off areas of the house!,"These worked like a charm after the dog had experience with an activated scat mat. We bought these to ""block off"" additional parts of the house. It is extremely rare for her to cross the boundary. We planned to switch one with the activated one if she did cross it but she hasn't even done it enough times to do that. This does not have the lines that the real one does. Seems like they could have at least drawn fake ""wires"" running through it, but she didn't seem to notice. By the way, I have tried just plain thick plastic from the fabric store before and it was not as effective. I guess this looks more like the real shock mat."
3,the top of my fountain was missing when I opened it to use at xmas,"my top part of my fountain was missing when i opened it to use for my xmas, party will please send it."
4,Fountain,Length:: 0:53 MinsWe bought the party fountain...here is a video showing how we liked the product.
1,not happy,"the nostalgia lighted party fountain is not user friendly.there are no serviceable parts, the lights in the bottom compare to Christmas lights,if they burnt out you can not change them. Mine came with one of the lights burnt out. How ever if working right, it could be fun. But for the moneyits basically use and throw away.Rita Soderstrom"
1,You are Not Getting What You See in the Picture,"The product that you see in the picture is nice and elegant looking. TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE THAT IT IS MUCH SMALLER, DIFFERENT DESIGN, USE IN THE BACKYARD FOR A TODDLER PARTY. DO NOT DARE USE IT FOR A FORMAL PARTY."
1,Parts missing,I bought this party fountain for a friend. The box looked new but there were parts missing. They didn't perform a quality check before shipping the product. I was not able to give it to my friend on time as I had to wait for a replacement.
3,lovely and messy,"The first box I received had the 2nd tube missing so I was only able to make a petite fountain.It is true that you cannot use carbonated soda as it stops up the fountain and it doesn't flow over. The motor is a bit loud. It makes quite a mess as the juice spatters around the bowl,but if you need to put a tablecloth or fabric around to pick up the mess.But it is pretty, so great for a girly party or big people gathering, the light makes a nice touch."
4,Clifford the Small Red Puppy,One day Emilys neighbors dog had puppys and wanted to give some away. Emily went over to there house and picked out a little red puppy and the neighbor told Emily that puppy wouldn't live very long but Emily loved that puppy and kept it. One night Emily told her puppy that she wanted it to get bigger an not die. After that Clifford began to grow and he ended up very big and healthy.I would recommend this book to children ages 3-8 its a very nice book for children learning to read.This book teaches you should always beleave in anything like your dreams and keep tryig for your goals.
3,Clifford by Justina,"I feel that Clifford the Small Red Puppy was a good story. Even though Clifford was small, Elizabeth still loved him. So even though you may start off small you are still going to grow, maybe not in the same ways but you will grow."
3,Clifford The Small Red Puppy,Clifford the Small Red Puppy was a book about a puppy that was born a runt becoming a large (Very large) healthy full-grown dog.The story starts out with the Clifford's owner Emily Elizabeth telling a friend the story of how Clifford came to be. The story goes when Emily lived in the city she didn't have a dog but their neighbor's dog had puppies and wanted to give some of them away. Among the puppies was a small red puppy but the owner said that she wouldn't live very long but Emily didn't care she loved that dog. One night she told Clifford that she wanted him to get big and not to die. After that Clifford grew to be extremely big and healthy.I enjoyed this book because it showed no matter what there is always hope. I would recommend this book for the age level of a child just learning how to read.
4,This cd sucks!,"As a fan of Buck o Nine, i expected this cd to be a great followup to their last one. boy, was i ever wrong. most of the songs are extremely boring, and the only cool thing about the disc was the cover. do yourself a great big favor and save the money....buy Pass the Dutchie instead."
4,Great Family Fun,"The whole Bedtime Stories series is well worth looking into. This title, ""My New Neighbors and Rotten Island"" is one of the best because it teaches kids not to judge others and they don't even know they are learning! I have three kids, ages 3, 10, and 11. All of them will watch this over and over. Boys, girls, it makes no difference because the stories, music, and voice overs are perfectly combined. Fun monsters and humorous portrayals make this a must-have edition for any video library."
4,Gave my sister nightmares!,Bought this a gift for my sister to remind her of our childhood. She always felt this book was scary - and reading it as an adult you can see why. It wasn't just her memory playing tricks on her. They don't write them like this anymore! She loved going down memory lane.
2,Too bad.....,"well built player, and feature rich, but unreliable with excessive freezing and locking up. Picture resolution below par."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Overhead Shield seats are terrible and should be illegal. Any car seat tech will tell you not to buy one, to buy a 5-pt harness. The shields are nicknamed ""skull busters"" by some techs because young children have literally hit their heads on them. DO NOT BUY!"
1,"1 yr 3 months - drive died!! Crappy drive, don't waste your money, this is the 2nd WD1200JB,...",drive I had fail shortly after 1 year and there is only a 1 year warranty. BUY SEAGATE DRIVES with the 3 year warranty you won't be disappointed!!!! I am waiting for my 3 other IDE WD drives to fail so I can replace these 3 drives also with Seagate drives... These drives are as bad as Maxtor!
3,Not too shabby,"Had this hard drive already installed in a computer I bought off an acquaintance. I immediately noticed the extremely high pitch loud noise, which turned out to be caused by this hard drive and another Western Digital 60 gb. It has been working great and is actually rather fast while playing games, so it would be very strange if both HDs had a fault that made them this loud, but were working perfectly in every other way. If I had the chance, I'd have gotten a different computer though, because the noise is almost unbearable at times."
1,Died under 2 years...two of them!,"OK, so when I built my machine in Oct, 2004 I bought 2 of these drives and never needed the 2nd one...never even formatted it. So a couple weeks ago my primary just dies with no warning...even Spinrite couldn't do anything with it after 2 weeks of running. So, at least I have the 2nd drive to use right? Wrong, the 2nd drive that was never used died too!!! My bad for installing the 2nd drive before I needed it, but I didn't realize that they spin constantly, whether being used or not. So 2 drives died at the exact same time?!?!? I'll never purchase another WD product."
1,dissatified,"I only ordered one ricochet lost worlds & I was charged for 2 & only sent one I let you know about this & nothing was done , I will not purchace any thing from amazon again"
1,Why sell something that doesn't work?????,"I have played this game online with no trouble. However, the company selling it is uncommuncative and evidently pirated this game. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Truenature Milk Thistle 200 mg 300 softgels,"I just got the container opened. It is one of these push down and turn tops. Even though I bought it a while ago, I could not use it because I had to have someone else open it for me. I will not buy this manufacturer again unless container says, ""easy open""."
2,Terrible Translations,"Finestein's translations are so awful, it is no wonder that few English speakers want to know who Tsvetaeva is. She loses the rhythm, rhyme, literary devices, and everything for which Tsvetaeva's poetry is so loved. The duality of meanings and word play is also completely lost. Try Angela Livingstone's translations - they are excellent."
5,Poems by a reliable witness,"Marina Tsvetaeva was born in Moscow in 1892, published her first poems at 18, and was married with two children when the Russian Revolution began. She endured numerous hardships -- one of her children died of malnutrition -- and a period of exile. She returned to Russia in 1939, but was so beset by her circumstances that she committed suicide in 1941. These passionate and autobiographical poems are deep and important. I don't know Russian, so cannot comment on the translation. From them one learns about Tsvetaeva the artist: her subjects are love and transformation, nature, poetry, love, and her complicated, exasperating country -- and, later, the bleakness which enveloped her. Poetry was serious business in Russia, and this poet was one of the greats."
3,Not impressed,"It's a slick looking external drive but it requires 2 (yes, two) USB ports to run, one for power and one for the connection, so that in and of itself is terrible. And if you connect the power to a hub, it will cause a surge. Should've just gone with one of the WD pocket drives."
3,Need a bit more help,"Having been out of the dating scene for awhile I thought I might pick this up. Ok, so it's been 10 years. I've been wrapped up in alot of things and just didn't have the time. This book is one I picked up just to bring me up to date on whats going on. There is alot of useful information for me but like I said I've been in the dark ages for awhile. It's a good book and one you should read if you've been dateless for some time.Truth is the one I missed on was this whole switch to online dating and let me tell you I was lost. But I picked up a few more books on this subject so I wouldn't get blindsighted out there. I would strongly recommend to any man or woman out there the one that got me off the ground and soring so to speak. "" How to get the Woman of your dreams using the Internet"" and ""How to get the Man of your dreams using the Internet"" What mroe can I say but there is nothing that isn't covered in this book, and when your done you can't keep up with all the responses :)"
1,terrible for CF folks,terrible book for CF . Only had 6 paragraphs about CF and book written in 1993 so it's very negative.
4,Music for concentration and focus,"I first read the research on the positive effects of classical music at 60 beats per minute many years ago. With no commercial options available then, I made my own tape from excerpts of world class recordings I own, largely of Mozart. I rarely tolerate background music while I work because it distracts and diffuses focus. The slow Mozart movements have an astonishingly opposite and positive effect, enhancing concentration and mental clarity. For listening pleasure, I prefer the complete works with all movements, as a prior reviewer noted. However, for calmed focus and concentration, by removing the alternate movements this recording serves that purpose with excellence.There is sufficient variety to avoid monotony, and while the musicianship will not garner critical acclaim it is competent and acceptable for the purpose of this recording. I enjoy it immensely. It is one of the rare pieces I will play in the background while doing work that requires serious focus."
1,Poor Implementation and Support,"I bought this software hoping to run SuSE Linux on top of Windows XP Pro so that I would not have to partition and dual-boot. Unfortunately, the product crashes everytime, during the boot. I called them about this, and they instructed me to wait for version 3.2, that the bug would be fixed. I waited for 3 weeks, and they allowed me to upgrade (since all 3.0 serial numbers work on 3.2). However, the bug is still not fixed, and because of their support policy, I can no longer get support (people rip on MS, but at least they will support their product!). So, now I am stuck with a product that doesn't work, and no one to tell me how to get it to work. I have hacked at this thing for about 30 hours, and still no luck. For all those who want to do cross-platform networking (virtual machining), DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT! They won't support it, and they know it doesn't work. Take it from a guru..."
2,Mediocre at Best,I was really disapointed with this one. The artwork was terrible and the storyline was not anything to write home about. Save yourself the $10 and buy something better.
3,Okay but won't get the other volumes,"Jazz, is in general a Like it or Hate it series. I fall in the, I didn't care much for it but didn't dislike it either category. It started off with a patient falling for his doctor, not too unreasonable. There was some non-con and a lot soul searching, nothing too much out of the Yaoi genre. What irked me was the overly Westernized way of speaking and calling peoples names. ""Doc"" this and ""Doc"" that. They should have just left it in the original Japanese, which may have been sensei. It reminded me of Passion where he kept on saying Sir."
4,Typical yaoi drama (not a bad thing!),"I got this today, finished reading it today, and ordered two more volumes today. I really liked this. Somehow the drama was...enticing. There were a lot of emotions flying around and undertones of romance. Seemed like it could end at just volume 1 like a oneshot, but the art is great and I really want to see how the characters and the story develop because they sure are under-developed in this volume. Yes, some non-consensual physical acts are displayed, but nothing particularly graphic (meaning you can't tell if anything is anatomically correct or not). Maybe someone who is more of a beginner yaoi reader or a boys love reader will want to shy away from this."
5,Books,"Execellent book. Definite page turner, I couldn't put the book down until it was finished. If a volume two comes out, I would purchase it in a heart beat."
4,Nice read,"Good graphics, nice character development, nice little storyline for yaoi. It wasn't a read that I would've stayed up all night reading, but it was a good buy."
2,Bored,"Well I want to give this one a chance so I went ahead and bought it.The drawing is very nice ,pretty guys,the gestures .However the character has no life ,no depth...the story is pretty weak.And if you are a hard core Yaoi fan ,this will bore you ....so dont even bother with this one."
1,do not waste your money,I wish I read the reviews on this book before buying it. It was a sad dissapointment to the very end. There was no character development and the plot just wasn't believable. I would suggest spending the $10 on something like embracing love or level c instead.
4,Nothing to complain about,"Overall a good album. Cadaveria has some of the best vocals i've ever heard from a female. The music overall isn't bad, but it not quite as good as the music from her former band Opera IX. Overall this cd is just missing one element to make it worth giving 5 stars, but not a disappointing purchase"
5,NICE,"Various sorts of metal combined with a woman's voice? Something like Nightwish? NO! Though she does sing clear vocals, but also angry whispering (or something like that) and growls. So her voice is definitly one of the best I`ve ever heard of. The instrumental part is nice and shows a more or less creative own style. Give this CD a listen and you'll find out for yourself"
2,Broken Packaging,The plastic packaging surrounding the car was cracked and open. It looks like it was opened and used prior to selling.
3,maybe a bad batch?,"we just got one too, and if you turned on ANY sound, it just made a horrible squealing noise. we returned it, and haven't decided yet whether to try again, because we really liked the light timer part."
2,"Good lighting functionality, poor sounds / radio (defective piece?)","Bought this with high hopes, I am hoping its just a defective piece - the light works well, but the sound is horribly distorted at pretty much any volume setting."
3,"Could be worse, could be better","I was very excited to try out this lamp because I have a very hard time waking up before the sun comes up. I have similar complaints:1. The high pitched noise at low light levels wakes me up instantly. I tried tightening the light bulb as another review suggested but that didn't work. I was hoping to be gently awakened by gradual light, but instead I wake up to a high pitched noise every day.2. The sound coming on at the same time as the light is just a bad idea. It would be nice to have the light come on and then have the sound kick in 5-10-15 minutes later.3. The soundscapes all seem to have one annoying sound in them.Still, despite its flaws, I do find it to be easier to wake up with this than it is to wake up with a traditional alarm clock and no light.Great idea, but it could use some work. Who tested this thing?"
2,"Nice wake-up, crummy lamp","Waking up to this product's sound and light is delightful. Trying to read, at night, by the ""daylight"" bulb is not delightful. The light is too dim. I've done the things suggested by instructions and other users, to no success. I must agree that, for the price, this product should have better sound and quality. That leaves us with ""Great idea, lousy execution!"""
3,Assumes you're already an expert,"The author coaches the reader through retrosynthetic analysis. He does a good job of explaining why specific bonds are chosen to be broken, giving a solid overall strategy to designing a synthesis. What he assumes is that the reader is an expert in chemical transformations. In other words, if you wanted to create an amino-substituted aromatic, he assumes you know that you could (as well as knowing how to) attach a nitro group and then reduce it. The author makes no attempt, either as a review chapter or appendix, to bring the reader up to speed on such matters. I suspect the book was created as part of the author's teaching duties and that his students were provided information separately that would fill in the gaps.Looking through my organic chemistry text, Organic Chemistry by P. Y. Bruice, the retrosynthetic approaches are in there with information on how to effect the transformations. I should have saved the money and just reviewed the Bruice text."
3,Happy couple gets dropped into a nightmare,"""Detour"" is a fast-moving novel that encompasses several tones and flavors: kidnapping story, political thriller, gritty drug story, domestic drama, and cat & mouse chase thriller among them. A young couple (do we still use the term ""yuppies"" these days?) travel to Colombia to adopt a child, but things get complicated when child and new mother are kidnapped by drug dealers funding local revolutionary efforts. Insurance actuary Paul Breidbart must rise to the occasion to get his new family back, as well as contend with his forced servitude as a drug courier for the kidnappers. ""Detour"" is a bit too busy at times, but it's laced with engaging characters and the story always remains at least moderately involving. Be warned, though: about halfway into the story there's a heck of a torture scene that's definitely not for the squeamish."
3,"Slow out of the gates, strong finisher!","I received this book as a gift. I didn't know much about the author. It took a while to hook me, but in the end it was hard to put down."
3,"Good book, but total ""fiction""","This was a good book and I enjoyed the read but had to write a review to tell you to forget the depiction of Colombia because absolutely none of it is true. Having adopted from Colombia myself, I never felt unsafe. Most Colombian people are extremely friendly and helpful. Colombia is a beautiful country and like any country, there are some dangerous places, too bad this author had to depict Colombia as such a horrible place."
2,not as good as Derailed,"I was disappointed after reading this novel. Derailed was absolutely riveting!! Couldn't put it down. Detour was too one-dimensional. Derailed was exciting and suspensful. This book was almost boring. I couldn't help comparing the two. Detour was just okay. I read the whole thing but when it was over, I was glad."
3,It Kept Me Awake,This novel had a lots of twists and was unpredictible. I looked forward to reading each night. I felt sadness for some of the characters in the story which is a compliment to the author James Siegel. I recommend this book.
5,Excellent,"This book is exactly what it is meant to be, entertaining. A mystery with many plot twists and turns. A great stand alone read. It does not have any returning characters, long courtroom dramas or police procedures to weigh it down. It moves at the speed of light and leaves you satisfied at the end."
4,You'll Be Reading This Way Past Your Bedtime,"James Siegel's newest novel is a page-turner in the truest sense of the word. The story rockets along, propelled by tight narrative, short action pieces, sizzling dialogue, and chapters that are shorter than the hairs on Michael Jordan's head. I found this book to be fun and involving, and though the two big twists at the end weren't surprising, the way the main character reacted to his own surprise made the segments believable.Highly recommended for those who just want to escape for a while."
2,"I expect more from Adobe, particularly on a Mac!","I've been a user of Adobe Acrobat Pro since it came out. I also used the Macromedia products for several years and after they merged, bought the upgrades to their suite of products. When Adobe came out with CS3 Web Premium, I purchased it thinking it would have been completely rewritten for the Leopard interface - not so much. Function and feature are there but this product was not developed with Leopard in mind, I got that directly from Adobe technical support. As I understand it, the later versions are a little better but I'm not a fan of the pervasive installation of Adobe products onto my Mac. I've since found alternate products that meet my needs and will continue to use them because of their significantly lower cost to own value.Not a good product to own in my humble opinion."
5,Best paper towel there is,"These towels live up to their reputation for absorbing more liquid and staying strong. The price is premium (and this is a best seller.) So we wait until they go on sale and stock up. In our house, there is no other paper towel allowed."
5,"Bounty Paper Towels, White, 15 rolls","fast shipping, arrived clean and intact with no perfumes, detergents or bad odors on it which has happened to me numerous times with on line ordering when the Paper Towels, charmin, toothpaste or whatever has been stored next to strong perfumes, detergents, soaps or aftershave. Yea Amazon."
3,THIS CAN'T BE BOUNTY,"When I purchased this product from Amazon, I was thrilled at the price, but when I started to use my paper towels, they went very fast, the roll had very few towels on it; and that I did not like, not at all. I must say the towels absorb very nicely, but there are not enough of them on the roll, you have to continuously get another roll, pretty soon you will go through the whole 15 count!"
1,Paid too much by about twice,I thought it was a reasonable deal but it was pointed out that both Costco and Wal-Mart cost about half as much for better quality Bounty Towels. I should have waited and picked some up at one of these stores.
4,A MUST READ FOR BOSTONIANS,"This is a must read for all people who is interested in the Architecture of famed Charles Bulfinch and history of Boston. Book basically covers one by one each major works of Charles Bulfinch in Boston, New england and other parts of the country. It is combination of History and Architecture. Each building is described and most of the time a picture is provided. The scope is mostly Historical description of the buildings, locations and their style. It is not an Architectural analysis of his works showing details of each component but paralels are given from similar structures in England.If you happen to visit Boston and see buildings designed by Bulfinch you start to see things behind the facade and notice any changes that he did to originial buildings or others did to his buildings."
1,Bumblebee Broke!,"Bumblebee broke today while my son was trying to transform him. He's heartbroken. He wasn't throwing it, he was sitting on an airplane trying to transform it and one piece that holds another snapped in half.Barricade? Too frustrating for words. Just as you are close to getting him back into car mode, pieces will pop out and ""untransform"". This is when adults are trying.Grrrr....."
2,transformer disaster,garbage. they fell apart within a week. toys are made for kids not for the shelf to look at.
4,"Fun, fragile","I am happy with this. I can sit by the side of the pool and swim it around and it looks surprisingly real with a little practice. Only issue with it is that it is somewhat fragile, and could be a little more waterproof. Not for small kids."
2,Only worked once!,"I bought this cool looking remote control shark and a hammerhead shark together by the same manufacturer. This Blue shark worked great out of the box in my pool, but died after that. I would not turn on anymore a couple days later. I replaced the batteries, but it just didn't work anymore. The Orange hammerhead shark also worked great the first time out, but then it just got stuck in reverse. I am trying to return both sharks now. These are great if you want to play with them...Once."
2,Shark died!,"Used it three times in our pool. Always drained and dried it. Now even with new batteries, shark won't turn on... Unbelievable!Went to Swimways site and they don't even sell it any more. Now have to find who is willing to help... Amazon or SW...."
1,"Fun toy, but not durable at all","I normally don't write reviews, but I just wanted to add my 2 cents because this toy completely died on me after a few times of use. I followed all of the care instructions. The shark worked great at first-- fun to control with very realistic motions. After a couple uses, the power button would not keep the shark on unless it was constantly depressed (I used a piece of tape). After that, the power button would not turn on the shark at all. I'm guessing the power-on mechanism is very fragile and not built to last, especially in water environments."
5,Just what I needed!,"Trying to put down the calculator and working each chapter of this book. So far, so good. Plan on using this regularly to stay active with activating the brain cells to compute without a calculator!!!!!"
2,Not good enough,First I would like to say this is my first review and i am writing this because I'm sick of ordering garbage on amazon because of the other good reviews. I started reading and following along with this book about a week ago. I got up to the part about adding fractions well this whole lesson went fine until i got to the mixed numbers and it tells you how to do them if there's no decimals and all the examples have none then all the test questions had decimals and no idea if you need to round them up etc. I gave this book 2 stars 1 because it is required and the second because this book is fair if you don't mind wasting money on a product that you need to get further reading on to understand problems throughout. Thank you ...
4,Most math you'll ever need.,"This book resumes all the math you'll ever need if you work as a janitor or a clerck, that said, it does a good job at explaining the basic mathematics of elementary and secondary school. The weakness of this book: it barely touches geometry, in it you'll only find how to measure the perimeter and area of rectangles, triangles and circles, nothing on volume or angles.It's a well written book, and overall a good one, and with more pages on geometry, it would have been an excellent one. Four stars."
4,Adding up!,This book is fantastic. I have always been hopeless at Math and I never even learned how to perform a long division! Well now I can solve long divisions and many other things besides :-)I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is specifically aimed at the US and therefore not metric (I live in the EU).
4,THE BOOK IS FANTSTIC. I AM STILL USING IT AND LEARNING BY THE SECOND. I RECOMMEND IT!!!,The book is easy to read. I got into it immediately. I recommend the book!!!!
5,What a neat book!,"This book is easy to follow and is very informational. If you're like me and just need to brush up on your basic math skills, this is a good book."
2,change the name to all the math a high school grad needs,"This book is very limited in scope. In my opinion it is written towards a high school grad. It covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, (applied to fractions), solving for X, ratios, big numbers, areas, etc. The explanation is clear, but the examples have little variety. You are not instructed to apply the math to a broad variety of applications or situations. The section on personal finances and business math is so simplified that it is not useful."
3,Too basic,"Unless you learned absolutely nothing in school about math or are highly fearful of math, I suggest purchasing something with more meat in it."
2,Good for reference,"Dr. Slavin does not explain the practice exercises well enough. I had to guess what rule of thumb he was using a lot. The practice exercises were okay, but I didn't feel ready to do all of them when I came to them. The subtitle says, ""A Self-Teaching Guide;"" how is anyone supposed to teach themselves with the rules used left out? I was mainly interested in the fractions and algebra; yes, my weakest areas. I also purchased ""Math Doesn't Suck,"" Danica McKellar; in this book, Ms. McKellar gives the reader enough explanations on the respective topic to be able to perform the related exercises with ease. Conclusion: in order to really refresh your skills in different areas on Mathematics, get more than one book to see how different authors approach the subjects. I have ""Practical Algebra,"" A Self-Teaching Guide, Selby/Slavin, so I'll have another chance to read/practice more of Dr. Slavin's exercises after I finish Ms McKellar's book, which I really like."
5,Best soft crate I've seen,"I'm very happy with this soft crate. It's easy to set up and take down, light weight and sturdy. I love the velcro on the doors so you can roll them up and they will stay up. It's also priced right. I recommend this crate to anyone with a dog that is suitable for a soft crate."
4,Very Nice,"I have gotten a lot of inspiration from this book. My only complaint is that the actual ideograms are somewhat confused by signatures, etc. I'd like it better if there were a word-by-word breakdown, so I could see what actually means what."
1,no better than nothing at all,"The dvd player never worked - not from the moment it was unpacked. And it wasn't one thing either - it was a whole bunch. The door wouldn't open to insert a disc. Then it said there was no disc (when there was). Next it got stuck playing and refused to respond to the remote or the buttons on the player itself....final straw, the door won't open to get the dvd back out.I didn't expect a lot - just a basic player that worked. Apparently that was too much to expect. I never even watched a single movie.Still going back and forth with Coby to resolve. Will update."
4,A typical movie at that time in Japan,"I have seen this move when I was 13, the beautiness of starring MIWA didn't affect to me, sorry, she was so old to me at that time. Now ? ah, I don't deny the beatuiness of her.The movie itself is not amazing level of art at that time, It was great years of Japanese movies."
2,Super Deluxe Renaissance Maiden Costume,The dress arrived in a very slim box and was extremely wrinkled. The top was too small and the skirt was too big. This should come with a warning to anyone not tall and thin and willing to iron much! I ended up remaking the dress so I didn't look so frumpy.
4,The Beaulieu segment on Aging,"Sometimes a person speaks English with a foreign accent and one is charmed by it. Other times, more often I guess, people speak English with a foreign accent and speak so horribly that one has difficulty paying attention to what they say. This interview comes closer to the latter possibility. Beaulieu talks about his research on Aging and answers Charlie Rose on the problem. Beaulieu tells us that half of those children born after two- thousand will live to be a hundred. He does not tell us however how he gets at this figure. Beaulieu says growth hormone can do more damage than good. He says that perhaps in one hundred years we will be able to see we have added twenty years to the average person's life. Beaulieu is polite, sincere, and unpretentious. But he does not really to my mind provide any new insight into the process of aging."
4,25% unforgettable and 75% enjoyable.,"One great track and three excellent back-up's.""Earth Tones"" has one of the most insiduous jazz riffs ever conceived - up there with Horace Silver's ""Song To My Father"", Miles Davis' ""So What"" and Lee Morgan's ""Sidewinder""... what goes on throughout the rest of the track is definitely not in keeping with the lounge music sax playing that Grover Washington is best known for... rather an anticipatory, sometimes rambling build-up that keeps you waiting until ""that riff"" re-appears... brilliant and unforgattable. Worth the price of the album on its own.""Mister Magic"", ""Passion Flower"" and ""Black Frost"" are more standard jazz-funk... perfectly enjoyable and imbued with equally insiduous riffsDon't ask me or my children why... a generation different in musical experience and a world apart in musical preferences but... if you, like we, are into funky jazz then this album hits the ""unforgettable"" button.Buy this, lay back and float upstream."
5,Mister Magic Glover Washington,An Great Classic Jazz Artist!! He left his soul on his sleeve for further Saxophone Artist of today!! One of my favorites!!
4,IT'S GREAT AND FUNNY...WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR!!,"THESE CRAZY CANADIANS REALLY TEAR IT UP ON THIS CD, I MEAN YOU HEAR THIS ALBUM IT WILL HAVE YOU SINGING ALONG AND LAUGHING IN NO TIME. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPIONTED IF YOUR FAN OF MELODIC FAST PUNK ROCK."
2,i don't like 1.5 stars,"uh, no. Thats all i can remember after listening to ""foot in mouth"" and then listening to too late...no friends. its just not the same. the songs are WAY too short and they all sound the same. there isn't really any melody or anything either, and alot of the chorus' sound shouted rather than sung. The song structure isn't too great to. If you like modern pop-punk, stick with Foot in mouth and MAYBE the world according 2 gob..."
4,Gettin to the Dance Floor is chocked full of good stories,"Gettin to the dance floor is a book full of stories which can create inspiration in any golfer. To truly appreciate the game of golf you must know something about its past. This books covers the stories of Bill Spiller, Gene Sarazan, Sam Snead, and much more.... If you are curious about them or the history of golf this is a must have book.."
2,Glamorizes Weekend Warriors in New York City,"This book is written about a boxer's workout, but it does not go into detail about the workouts and it is not presented by a boxer. It is written by a weekend warrior in New York City who glamorizes the sport for his yuppie buddies and defunct gym owners. While there is a mention of the actual workout, there is insufficient detail about the workout and its many variations. I was very disappointed with it, and I work out in New York City."
2,Mediocre at best.,This book is very disorganized and very dated. The abdomen exercises are particularly old fashioned. The parts that deal with punching and blocking are accurate but not well written or very thorough. To any would be boxer out there I would say go to a gym. This book at best will be only a suplement and not a good one at that.
3,a book for the few,"As a working class reader (truck driver). I was a bit annoyed that this book focussed on the white collar gentleman at all times and not on just anyone interested in the sport. this can be off putting and annoying. I persevered with the book though and found it to be an enjoyable read and have applied some useful tips and techniques to my own boxing training and sparring. The big dissapointment for me was the diet section (one of the main reasons for me buying the book). I expected a whole chapter with meal planning, weight loss/gain advice and more, but got barely a page.Overall i think you should get it if you are begining boxing training and wanting to get fit but try to look past the stuff about white collar boxing. the sport is for everyone regardless of class. The author should have written it with everyone in mind."
1,Don't waste your money!,This book seems like a toast to all of the author's boxing buddies! The instructions are old fashioned and the the material is very shallow. It also has the ugliest cover I have ever seen on a book (no wonder they don't display it here on Amazon.com!)
3,A good basic guide for the novice who is interested in the benefits of boxing as a fitness activity.,"I noticed there was a lot of negative criticism on this book. I agree that this is not the best book a person interested in boxing can buy; nevertheless, if an individual is seeking some basic information on fitness boxing, this book can be of some value. I also agree with the critic that pointed out that boxing for fitness is not only for white collar men and women, and that the book should have had a broader scope.For several years I taught a Box aerobics class and had a wide variety of people interested in fitness boxing. In conclusion, this book if used in conjunction with training in a boxing gym or a box aerobics class, will provide some good basic information.Rating: 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Predator Hunter: A Warrior's Memoir)."
3,basic intro to boxing workouts,"I don't understand some of the other reviewers because it does give a basic workout in order to train in boxing. Not like others where boxing is more an ""aerobics"" class than training. It goes over basic punches, combinations, some defense (could be better), and goes over the basic structure of how to train. Does he use his friends in pictures? yes, does he romantically describe the gyms in new york? yes, but I wish they had some where I am because I would love that type of atmosphere while working out... Bottom line, I still refer to it when I am designing a workout."
5,Great Book!,"This book lays it all out for you. How to get started, what equipment you need to buy (if any) and a step by step progression on boxing. It gives you the tools, some strategy, and of course, the ""Boxer's Workout"" which is great.Five stars for this great look at boxing!"
2,Only Peter's friends would enjoy this book,"this book was written to show off the New York City white collar boxing community. It had an okay section on actual movement, defense, and punches, but seemed to focus on his white collar friends. He even used them as models, and refers to them in text. Overall it wasn't worth reading, and as far as conditioning it doesn't tell you enough specifics. Only to run, and shadowbox, not going to far into what else may be beneficial. Overall I'd say this book isn't worth a damn, and I would rather learn a workout from the likes of a Billy Zabka."
5,"Peter, you brought it all back......","Having trained at gleasons gym with Al Gavin and once sparring with the author himself (A 3 round war!!!), this book just brought me back to all the great feelings of that place and those people who were all mentioned. I miss those days very much and this book keeps that memory alive in me always. For all who did not enjoy this book, you had to know those people and live the experience and fear you felt when walking up ""those stairs"". The picture of Peter walking up those stairs reminded me of that feeling I got everytime I walked them myself at 16 years old. Thanks Peter for that picture and this book."
1,THIS SUCKS!!!!!,"DO NOT waste your cash!!! I love Alicia Keys and actually worked on several of her sessions as a studio musician, she's lovely I might add. The use of her name on this DVD is embarrassing!!!! The same still photos (that look like they were photoshoped from tabloid magazines) are flashed OVER and OVER again, and there is ""commentary"" from a bunch of jokers whose titles and credits are never made known...and who surely don't know Alicia or even work in the entertainment business. To make a DVD this bad should be a carnal sin...buy the real deal, ANYTHING WILL BE BETTER THAN THIS!"
1,glad i didn't buy this,"This would've been one for the collection, except it's AWFUL. I'm SO glad I watched this one before ordering. Alicia Keys has so much more to offer than shown here. I didn't even watch the whole thing before packing it up and sending it back. The production was terrible. And who were these people giving commentary? I, too, will wait for the official release."
2,Alicia Keys from start to stardom,This DVD was boring! It made some incorrect statements on the life of Alicia Keys. It's like looking at a magazine full of pictures and listening to someone talk more than anything. It's not worth your hard earned money! Wait for Alicia's Authorized DVD to come out!
1,Total .....!,"Don't waste your money on this trash. I swear it seems as if the friends of the makers were the people giving commentary, not ""insiders"", or experts. These folks couldn't even formulate a proper sentence. This is a total effort to take Alicia's fans for their money. Alicia acknowledged this DVD herself in one of her own Diary entries at her site. It's rubbish."
4,70'S BALLADS AT THEIR BEST!,"This was Diana Ross fourth album release in 1973, is a great example how Diana aproach with great class all the adult contemporary scene, the ballads include in this extremely sophisticated collection are totally relaxing and great to listen when you're just chilling, sadly is not that available anymore, is hard to find, someday they well remastered the album and will rise again in the catalog charts of Motown. None all the songs are bad so you should know what to expect. Great buy. Just as a reminder ""Touch Me In The Morning"" was Diana Ross second #1 single in the HOT 100."
3,And now for the DVD???????????????,"Seems that with the death of Deborah Kerr that there are still a number of her films that have never been transferred to DVd and this would be one at the top of that list. Despite its age, its horrific ending (that tacked on guilt ridden ending should be burnt and let the film end the way the stage play did), there is still some great work here from Deborah and John Kerr (despite looking late 20s at the time which he probably was) I recently transferred my old video off- the -TV print to DVD and whereas it is nice to have it on a DVD format, with a scratchy print, it badly cropped for TV, its like watching half the movie. Other films of Ms Kerr that should also travel quickly to DVD would be ""Chalk Garden""and ""Bonjour Tristesse"""
2,A missed opportunity,"Having recently seen the widescreen laser disc of ""Tea and Sympathy"" I can only say it was a missed opportunity. The homosexuality issue is skirted around; the lead character is quite clearly gay and I have trouble believing he would then have an affair with a woman."
4,"Great taste, less buzz","Chicory gives this coffee its rich taste, dark color and syrupy body -- I guess, although no other chicory-cut coffee I've ever tasted was this good. Although this coffee tastes very strong and robust, I suspect it has less caffeine than the straight stuff; at least, I've been able to drink a lot of it without getting the jitters.I usually buy mine for some ridiculously low price at an Asian market, but lately they've been out of stock. Anyone know why Asian markets carry this product? I wonder if there's an interesting story behind that..."
2,Definitely not for me,"I drank the cafe au lait at he Cafe du Monde years ago and had it with their beignet. Seemed nice to me. But the past few years I have been drinking French Market brand coffee (with chicory) and it is much smoother, chocolaty, with no bitter aftertaste like the Cafe du Monde brand has. I make them in a French Press and the French Market is much better. Otherwise I use Lavazza or Illi brand coffee's in a single cup filter cone or espresso machine. I know coffee's and CdM just doesn't cut it for me."
2,Tried Many - This is not the best,"Prior to visiting New Orleans I drank the usual national-brand, plastic-jug coffee sold in supermarkets across the country. After visiting New Orleans and developing a liking for C&C; (coffee and chicory) I've tried numerous brands of both medium-dark roast and dark roast C&C.;Of the two roasts I found I like the dark roast more (which Cafe du Monde C&C; is). I was excited to try the brew from the coffee stand we visited several times near Jackson Square but was disappointed when I made my first pot of Cafe du Monde C&C.; It has kind of a burnt taste to it (while the French Market City Roast I tried - which is also a dark roast - has kind of a chocolate taste to it).Cafe du Monde may be the preferred brand if you're going to serve your coffee 'au lait' style with 1/2 hot milk (as they do at the actual cafe near Jackson Square) but it's not the best if you're going to have your coffee with just a touch of cream and/or sugar."
5,Love it,Perfect for iced coffee. I use a vietnamese coffee press and enjoy this as a treat. Medium bodied coffee. Smooth and just tastes great !
5,Iced Coffee YUMM,"If you ever order Vietnamese iced coffee, this is what they use 90% of the time at least around here. If you have never tried it, do yourself a favor and try it extra strong, with a little bit of sweetened and condensed milk, then poured over ice. Id say its more addictive than cigarettes LOL!"
5,Coffee hog,"I don't drink just one brand of coffee. I keep several different coffee brands around so I drink coffee by mood. Since I quit smoking, I can taste the differences in coffee. As a kid growing up in the Smokey Mountains, my folks drank coffee with chicory and if you were still sleepy, after one taste of their coffee, you were wide awake. The Cafe Du Monde is much more user friendly and has a very mellow taste. It only takes about a third of the coffee grounds to make a decent cup of coffee. I guess you could use more and get that 'eye opening' experience but I drink coffee for the pure pleasure of it not as an endurance test."
1,Doesn't do the job,"I had high hopes for this nasal dilator, but it did not perform. The magnets that are meant to hold the clip together are too weak to do the job. You'll find yourself waking up every morning wondering whether you've inhaled the device because it comes off within the first thirty minutes of sleep. The design and idea have great potential, but the final product needs to be improved."
1,bad service,"It took almost 2 months to get what i ordered from this web site.Will never order from this place again.Could have credited my account for the problems,no call no email,nothing.Had no problem taking the money out of my account the next day .Did not loose that did ya?"
1,Just doesn't work...at least for me.,"I have used the breathe strips, and they sorta work. This snoreclipse product doesn't do anything for my type of snoring. I don't know the clinical diagnosis, but it is apparently not related to a pinch at the tip of my nose. Money wasted for me..."
4,"I didn't think it would work, but it did.","It sounded like snake oil - with the magnets and all, but apparently they are there to put pressure on the sceptum. This did surprisingly open my passages and I could breath easier.Based on the other reviews, it may not work for all snoring, but it worked for my type.The device is a bit annoying to wear, but i didnt notice it the second night."
3,High sinus pressure,"This item works for me. I have a very loud and heavy snore, and I also have apnea at times. This was so severe that my girlfriend couldnt take it. I got this item and used it and it instantly elliminated completely my snoring.The negative side effect was that, since the device stimulates excessive bloodflow to the sinuses it made them feel over pressurised and it also made my head dizzy when I woke up at night.I believe that having such a high blood pressure in the head is not healthy and I have not been able to find any clinical studies dealing with this problem with this device so I dont know how safe it is in this aspect.Since it works i will use it for now but with causion.It never fell off at night."
2,only worked very first time,"only first time worked, and I could feel my nose very clear, after that went back to my wife hitting my back,"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I had bought a gift package for a dear friend with a snoring problem.The Snoreclipse didn't even stay on, so didn't work at all.Fortunately, I had also bought him the AB Contour pillow which worked well."
4,Great if you don't mind the sound not working,"The toy was easy to put together and my 12 month old daughter already likes it even though it's meant for 18 months +. The only gripe I have is they obviously didn't Quality Control it very well as the sound part in the pony's head does not work. It does only if you hold all the battery connections together, but Hello, you can't do that once you put the head on! I didn't care enough to send it back as I can do without the noise anyway...it was very loud! :0)"
4,the pleasure of study,"This book is not only important, but also attractive. In current oceanography, the classical marine ecosystem image that is based on phytoplankton and crustaceans is not always applicable. When crustaceans cannot perform their role as glazer, gelatinous organisms, like tunicates or jellyfish, can produce their clones rapidly and fill the gap of food chain. But, the facts about tunicates has fined out relatively recently, this book is the only review. And this book explains the history of the science related to these organisms, so we can understand the difficulties and the pleasures of the study."
5,excellent bible,"I just love the fast shipping, it didn't take long to get my bible. It is just like the original one I had, easy to look up the underlined words to get the meaning in Hebrew and Greek."
4,key word study bible,"The book arrived quickly and it was in great condition however it looked different than the book that was shown, it didn't matter much. I would reccomend this book to anyone wanting to the real meaning of words."
4,"For the Christian on the ""MEAT""","Pro's:KJV - Poetic and a literal translationStrong Numbers - so you can study the origianl language and come away with a deeper meaning for God's Word.Comentary - Some very useful comentary and historical in-sights.Con's:Strong Numbers - Incomplete, selective words. Suggest getting a complete Strongs Concordance to go with this study Bible.Price - Kind of expensive. If you already have a KJV Bible, suggest getting a Strongs instead. If you can afford it, buy it.......!"
5,Clarification of NIV/Morning Star,"If you look up the name ""Lucifer"" from the KJV version in the Strong's concordance, it is no. 1966 which means 'morning star' as well as 'Lucifer' and one other meaning. The NIV translators merely chose a different but still accurate definition--probably to help achieve copyright ability. They did not change the meaning of the text or capitalize the words 'morning star' as they do when it applies to Christ in Rev. 22:16. Please do check it for yourself."
1,inconvenient look-up definitions,"I just got this book a few days ago hoping that it would be the ultimate answer for all or most of the key Hebrew/Greek original translation notes that it boasted of, which it indeed does have, but it only has very few explanatory notes on the same page, but many inconvenient look-up definitiion which means you'll be jumping back and forth to the end of the book.Zodhiates does a good job otherwise, extremely light weight (around 2200 pp), easy to read print and handy size, maps, and with the complete dictionary concordance of all rhe words in the bible and other lexical aids. This book is not for just high scholar only, but I think to the layreader also. perhaps the ""Thompson Chain Reference Bible"" is a better choice for many convenient translational footnotes."
5,This Bible will enrich and strengthen your walk with God!,"Ever since I received this Bible as a gift 8 yrs. ago, it has been the only Bible that I have used... in my studies, meditation, and preaching. The Greek & Hebrew Strong's numbers inserted in the text throughout, plus the complete Strong's Concise Dictionary and additional Greek and Hebrew/Chaldee helps, my understanding has grown immensely under the leadership of the Holy Spirit. I recommend this Bible to any serious child of God who would like a decent measure of Greek and Hebrew help in a single-source Bible. The commentaries are useful and it is by far a tremendous resource to aid in your walk with the Lord. As mine is near worn out I plan on purchasing another very soon...in King James only!"
5,"A lot of Bible ""Bang"" for the buck!","I bought this Bible for my wife who was excited about the study helps, notes and Strong's dictionary included. I was impressed that all this was included in this genuine leather Bible for the money we spent. The editor seems to endeavor to give a reasonable explanation of various views before stating his own. The notes may not always ""stroke"" the reader's safely held beliefs if he or she has been carefully weaned on particular doctrinal philosophy. To me this is good. Too much dependence on the positions of editors is to be avoided. We need to search for the meaning of the text, not just a quick explanation. The Hebrew-Greek Key Study Bible has some detailed explanations to be sure, but there are other helpful resources within its pages as well. Buying this Bible will not be a mistake."
2,Boring boring boring,I used this tape only few times while I was pregnant - I couldn't stand to do it more than that because it was so boring and repetative. It did not hold my interest at all and I found it annoying. There are other videos out there that are more interesting and just as relaxing - don't waste your money on this one!
2,Not enough salsa,"I am very active and 29 weeks along in my pregnancy. I exercise at least 5 days a week. Typically I walk, use the eliptical machine,spin and lift weights. I was looking for a workout video i could use on the mornings i didn't make it to the gym. After reading several reviews i thought this was the video for me. I was so excited when it arrived, I made sure i did the video the next morning. This tape turned out to be totally NOT for me. I found the tape to be extremely boring and i did not feel as though i had a good workout when the video was over. The 20 min. of salsa is the best part but just not long enough. I would like the video if the majority of the time was spent doing the salsa. I just feel that the Yoga is too slow and boring. It would have been nice to have a try before you buy on this video, because i would not have bought it."
2,Didn't motivate,I got this for my wife and she really didn't like it.She found it not very motivational. She however was very into exercise before becoming pregnant (ran marathons a couple times a year plus many smaller races - hit the gym daily) so maybe that is why.
5,fun and effective,"fitmama was the perfect dvd 4 me, the moves didnt take alot to learn, but my muscles could feel it, it was ver effective, eve my OB.GYN uses it during her pregnancy and she LOVES it, this is a very fun and effective prenatal video, the perfect tempo and pace to stay active and healthy"
2,Boring!,"This DVD just keeps repeating 3 sequences in the Salsa, as well as, the yoga portion. Not creative. I was bored the first time I used it and haven't been inclined to use it again. Best for those who don't usually exercise and want to make an effort during their pregnancy."
3,OK Workout - not great,"I am in my 5th month of pregnancy and worked out pre-pregnancy and up to this point in my pregnancy. I didn't find this workout to be at all challenging. A person just starting to workout would be very satisfied and appropriately challenged with this workout. The segments seemed very repetitive. The yoga section was very jerky, no movements were held for any length of time. The instructor wasn't annoying nor was the music, I just didn't find this workout to be very good for someone who is used to working out."
3,"Was good, but not great","This is a nice alternative to have when you need to mix things up with your workouts....but- both the salsa dance and yoga fat burn are pretty basic. The yoga portion was a bit disappointing to me, maybe because it was more of a cardio version (breathing and moves are not all typical yoga.. some moves too fast, etc.). Leisa is easy to follow and isn't annoying so it's worth it from that perspective. I gave it 3 starts because I liked it, but I could probably live without it."
2,Gets boring fast,"The workout is repetitive and gets boring very fast especially if you are used to high-paced workouts. Leisa Hart narrates with a too peppy and somewhat condescending tone which gets annoying.The yoga section is not neccessarily yoga and has no calming results.I suggest Prenatal Yoga for an interesting, great workout in any stage of pregnancy!"
4,Lifesaver,"I've had awful sciatica pain that ran through my right buttock off and on for a few months during my pregnancy. Then for a while it got really bad and I had difficulty walking and getting in and out of chairs, especially getting in and out of my car. The stretch that they do on the tape for sciatia pain SAVED me. My pain is barely there now, thank goodness!I only wish that I had bought the DVD instead of the VHS, I didn't realize it came in a DVD format when I bought it.I'm enjoying the breathing exercises a lot, it's very relaxing and helps me get in tune with my body."
5,Repetitious but a good workout,"I get a little bored with the video because we repeat everything a lot, but it is the perfect level of cardio for being pregnant. I am only in my 1st trimester but I am very tired all the time. Somedays I just do the salsa segment and other days I do the whole video depending on how I feel. I really like the Fat Burn Yoga segment. It's not really yoga, but I like the routine. I feel like I get to work my muscles in this video. Leisa also does a great job explaining things and inspiring you to work out more. She looks great pregnant!! I highly recommend this video for women in any trimester. (She does give good modifications for different trimesters)"
4,Not a bad workout,"I like this workout video, because it is different than some of the other ones I have. It sections the workouts, which is good because sometimes you don't have a full hour to workout. It's more upbeat than your regular yoga workshop. It also has a 20 min salsa workout, which is a nice change of pace. They have people working out in each trimester, so no matter what stage you are at, there is someone to follow."
4,"great salsa dancing, yoga not so great","I really enjoy the aerobic salsa dancing part of this workout, it perks you up and you can squeeze it in during naptime. I've practiced yoga for years and take prenatal yoga classes, yet I don't enjoy the fat-burn yoga chapter of the DVD. Its very aerobic and they don't hold the poses long enough to feel a good stretch. In my last pregnancy I did the Shiva Ray yoga workout almost every day and loved it, unfortunately, its not available on DVD yet. I would recommend that one for yoga practice over Leisa Hart's version."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I was super active before I got pregnant & this video was not what I was looking for to help keep me in shape while pregnant. I didn't break a sweat, let alone felt like I got a work out. I felt like I got a better workout going on a brisk 2 mile walk around the subdivision. I would recommend for people who are not active and are looking to start working out while they are pregnant though."
3,Pregnancy workout DVD,Its OK. I was doing P90X prior to pregnancy unfortunately I was not able to do any workouts for my first trimester due to severe migraines. Once my migraines eased up (2nd trimester)I tried this and it just wasn't the right fit for me. I felt that it wasn't really doing anything for me and I got easily bored.
1,Worst Pregnancy Video,"I have been working out for a number of years now and I am pregnant for the second time. For my first pregnancy, I worked out at the gym, solely. For this one, I am preparing to move into a new home and I already have a 2 1/2 yr old so getting to the gym is not as easy as it used to be, but I want to keep in shape with this pregnancy as I did the first. This video is so REPETITIVE it is unbelievable. The yoga portion literally is 3 moves that you repeat for 20 minutes!! After completing the video for the first time, I didn't feel as though I worked out and felt like I still needed to go to the gym. The Kathy Smith video is a much better purchase for someone who has been working out and who likes variety, rather than 3 repetitive moves.This video is only for women who are just starting to work out. It is definitely not for someone who is used to regular aerobic activity and/or weight training."
3,"One of the better prenatal workouts, but a bit boring","I really like Leisa Hart. I think that she is very motivating. However, I think that the workout gets a bit boring after a while. During the aerobics and yoga workouts, the same routine is done over and over and over again. I like the routine, but it just gets boring.I really like the Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout the best. Kathy really varies each aerobics routine. My only complaint with Kathy's Video is that she has this 'rap' song session where you just watch the pregnant moms give a little 'rap'. I just skip this 'cutsie' section."
4,Good Fun workout,"I love the Salsa dance, Stretching and Ease Labor sections. The Yoga Burning part is strange because it doesn't look like a yoga practise to me. These workouts are easy to follow but make me sweat a little. Overall, this is a good prenatal workout."
1,"Hated it. Annoying voice, poor workout.","I dont care for this tape. I find Leisa Hart annoying and hate her breathing on the yoga section. It is so loud its disctracting. I skip the salsa dancing, can't take her talking. I am a hge yoga fan, but cant take her loud breathing and poor form. I actaully gave this DVD to a local charity after about 3 trys."
1,Too Repetative,"It starts out okay, but the film looks really old, and after ten minutes of doing the SAME move over and over I was fast forwarding and finally skipped to Yoga. The sound is awful--you can hear her breathing better than the music. I dislike this video. I would not recommend it. Kathy Smith's is a much better option."
3,Very repetitive!,"Not a huge fan of this video. The salsa dance portion is very repetitive. You do one move for 13 of the 20 minutes with a few other moves thrown in here and there. The yoga fat burn section is a little better, but there is no instruction regarding form and way too much bouncing to be considered proper yoga. The best part was the labor and delivery prep. I did enjoy that part."
3,I like the aerobic aspect,"This workout is OK. I like the aerobic aspect as you don't seem to get too much of that by way of prenatal workouts. It is highly repetitive though. I was a little disappointed in the yoga section- it's not at all what I'd expect from Yoga and again- extremely repetitive. I do like the salsa portion and often use it as a warm up to pair with other shorter workouts like the Erin O'Brien workout. One of my pet peeves with this workout- the way Lisa Hart says ""salza"" over and over, but that has no baring on the workout :) Overall, if you're looking for something different to add to your routine this one is OK."
3,Not for me,"I was really wanting to like this DVD. However, I just can't do it! I purchased it at the beginning of my second trimester and every time I do the salsa portion I get sharp pains in my belly. I am now 31 weeks and still get those pains. The yoga portion is pretty good, but I would not purchase the DVD just for that alone. I was fairly active before getting pregnant and still do cardio and yoga at the gym 3-4 times per week. I love Leisa's energy, but this just isn't the right workout for me."
2,"""Haven't I done this before"" or ""Boring, boring, boring""","I have only done the yoga workout, but it's the same basic moves over and over. By the fourth rotation I was looking for a new challenge, but never got it. For someone who's in pretty good shape, or who is use to a diverse workout this DVD won't keep you going."
2,Repetitive and Boring,I've never done one of Leisa's workout dvds before and she provides good instruction and is upbeat. The only thing is that the whole workout is soooo repetitive. I can't stop glancing at the clock and when she asks you to do the same exercise over and over I want to yell at the TV. I tried it once before and was bored out of my mind and thought I'd give it another try today. I really want to like it. I won't waste my time with this one again.
2,some thoughts about this product,"I was disappointed with the video after reading the great reviews of others. I think the workout is not well-rounded enough and felt it was not challenging at all. For hardcore exercisers, I recommend doing a different video routine. This was boring and too easy."
3,"Okay Video, better than most","I work out on a regular basis, usually yoga, kickboxing, outdoor, outdoor sports. When I got pregnant I wanted to keep up with my routine but also try something that would not put stress on my body. I bought this video because of other's reviews and was pleased the first time I did it. It is a good video, real pregnant women. Yet it is slow and repetitive. I do sweat but only can motivate myself to do the video maybe once a week. I am five months along and still feel that I can handle a more intense workout. I have a friend who is 5 months along and feels worn out when the video is done. So great for those who are not as active, but if you are really looking for a workout, keep looking."
3,A little disappointing,"I purchased this video based on the good reviews it has received. I was disappointed with it because it doesn't have much to keep my interest. The salsa section does get your heart rate up a little, but is just a continious repitition of a few moves. I enjoyed the yoga fat burn section a bit more. It isn't really ""yoga"" but is loosely based on it. It did repeat itself, but I was sore the next few days in my butt and thighs. That was nice. I am 18 weeks pregnant and have started doing the Perfect Pregnancy Workout for now and will return to the less strenous FitMama video as my pregnancy progresses or if the doctor tells me to cool it a bit."
3,A little disappointing,"I bought this DVD because of all the good reviews, but didn't really find it challenging. I actually use my Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout more because it gives me a better cardio workout now that I'm beginning my third trimester. If you have been practicing Yoga, then the Yoga Fat Burn section may be a bit disappointing. It's not really Yoga and it goes through the poses pretty quickly. The rest of the video is ok. A bit too repetitious and causes some boredom for me."
4,Worth your money and time,"I didn't work out much during my first trimester out of fear/anxiety/and fatigue, but have noticed that I need something to do because its just too cold to walk outside. I ordered this DVD and have been doing it over a week and feel so much better. I feel those long lost quad and hamstring muscles as well as the hip flexors. My shoulders feel stronger already and i'm relaxed. I worked out pre-pregnancy using the Firm and this is a nice substitute. If you do the work in the video you'll break a little sweat and feel pretty good. I don't have any experience with Yoga, but her ""yoga"" section is very challenging and i really like it. i would recommend this DVD to any pregnant lady out there. Lauren"
4,Really fun workout!,"Well, after reading the reviews here I decided to buy this, and boy, am I glad I did! I really like Leisa. Usually the too-happy, bubbly instructors irritate me, but I wasn't bugged by her at all; I really felt like she was truly enjoying herself. The salsa dance was fun, although repetetive, but just what I need for my last 11 weeks. I only gave it four stars because during the Kegels segment, she never explains what you're supposed to be doing. I know how to do Kegels, so I was fine, but it is possible that someone would not know. Overall, I think this is a great video."
4,Great for maintaining your fitness level,"This is my first prenatal workout video and I found it to be just the right activity level for me. Before I got pregnant, I was a very active jogger. Now, at 13 weeks, I walk more than run. Fit Mama is a good supplement to that. The 20 min salsa routine is fun and very easy to follow along (no confusing steps and lots of repetition). Most of the cardio comes from constantly lifting your arms above your head; a good way to work up a light sweat. And the 20 min yoga is also very easy; the moves are so simple, I've remembered and used them without having to put the DVD in! The biggest benefit I get from Fit Mama is improved digestion. Like many pregnant women, I've had bouts of indigestion/heartburn, but all the stretching and arm movements of this DVD really helps my stomach feel less bloated."
2,"Repetitive, too easy for regular excercisers","I agree with an earlier reviewer that this video is highly repetitive. I don't do many fitness videos (usually go to a gym or yoga studio) so perhaps it compares well to others (seems to, according to it's high ranking!). Yes, she is sweet and her instructions are clear, but I was bored to tears after one or two uses, especially when I was still fairly fit in early pregnancy. If you're not used to excercising and/or you're in your last trimester, it may be of benefit. I wouldn't spend the money again."
2,Not for me,"I bought this video based on all the reviews but I didn't like it. I am 28 years old who worked out (not an athlete) prior to pregnancy and this was very boring to me. I played it once and shelved it. It basically is a video on how to breathe and would not tone arms, legs, thighs, back, chest or calves. I started out fairly toned and found basic exercises work better than this video."
1,No Idea Why This Video Gets Good Reviews,"BORING! First off, the filming and sound are horrible! Second of all, the workout is terrible. She teaches you three moves and you repeat those three moves for the entire thing! I was so bored, and I wanted something that would challenge me and make me want to move. Add the horrible workout to the poor sound, the bad filming, and the sickly looking people working out with her--no. I would recommend Kathy Smith's pregnancy workout, or the Perfect Pregnancy workout vol 1 (NOT vol 2!). I would even recommend Denise Austin's before I recommend this one--and that's saying something. This is absolutely terrible. Anyone who is accustomed to doing video workouts would desire more than this video has to offer."
2,Third Trimester Essential,"Third Trimester Retraction: I still dislike the salsa. However, the Yoga Fat Burn, Labor and Delivery prep and, prenatal stretch and relax are life savers. With my big prego belly I find the routine to be what I need to relieve tension and give me a sense of confidence about delivery. Note: My rectus muscles did seperate so prelim work will be required in postnatal exercise.First Review (second trimester): I was very excited about this video, especially the salsa section. I was hoping for fun and sexy with the Salsa and focused and challenging for the Yoga. When it came, I was disappointed. The music and routines (Salsa Dance 20 min, Yoga Fat Burn 20 min.)were monotonous and boring."
2,boring and the breathing stinks,"this video is brutal for people who already workout.It's boring and all the breathing techniques really leave you breathless!the salsa is kind of goofy, the only good thing about this video is the end."
2,Disapppointed,"I was very excited about this video, especially the salsa section. I was hoping for fun and sexy with the Salsa and focused and challenging for the Yoga. When it came, I was disappointed. The music was monotonous, and both the Salsa Dance (20 min.) and Yoga Fat Burn (20 min.) routines were very repetitive. I was bored the first day.I couldn't connect with Leisa's style. I really enjoy Denise Austin's style of encouragement and instruction (e.g., her pilates videos) and Richard Simmons energy and fun (e.g., his Sweatin to the Oldies video). I wanted this tape to be a combination of those styles, but it isn't close. If you dislike these types of instructors or tapes, you might like Leisa's style.On the positive side: I do enjoy Leisa's 6 min. Labor and Delivery prep and her 8 min. prenatal stretch and relax. Also, the DVD quality (studio & menu selections) is very good."
4,Not a bad workout,"Its got a bit of everything which is nice. The only portion that is so so is the ""Salsa"", being Latin I expected something a little more upbeat. It was still good buy though."
4,Good Buy,"I have to say, overall, I'm enjoying this product. I ran until my 6th month of pregnancy and then switched to this. The workout is pretty good and by my last trimester, I was in need of something lighter. I did sometimes add light weights (2 lbs) to the arm movements. Also, the salsa dancing is a bit cheesy but you can work up a sweat. The instructor keeps saying things like ""don't you feel sexy/sassy?"" - my response was always ""no!"" I banned my husband from the room when I was doing this tape because you feel weird.I enjoyed the yoga fat burn because it forced me to do squats (something I really needed to do).The fact that the instructor is in her last trimester but looks that good can be a little annoying. However, I recently saw a photo of her not pregnant and, believe it or not, she did gain some weight in her pregnancy. I just wish my arms looked like hers! :o)Overall, it's a good buy."
3,Good pregnancy workout -- at least part of it,"The workout is divided into three sections: salsa dance, yoga fat burn, and stretching/labor and delivery prep. I thought the salsa dance was a lot of fun and a good way to get your heart rate up to a safe level during pregnancy. The yoga fat burn section, as other reviewers have said, is boring. She offers about 5 moves, repeated several times. I had to stop about 75% of the way through because I was bored to tears and tired of doing the same sequence of moves over . . . and over . . . and over again. The stretching section is sufficient, although could be a little longer. The labor and delivery exercises (Kegel exercises and abdominal work) were great.I use this video for the salsa dance and stretching and skip the yoga. I use a separate video for yoga on alternate days."
2,It was ok,I received this as a bundle with Gaiam's prenatal Yoga video. This video goes way too fast and I only used it once. But I guess for next to nothing what would you expect.
4,Its a good workout,"I like this video, I just think it moves a little bit fast for someone who does not exercise that often or this intensely. I am a very uncoordinated person, and I have a visual problem, so I felt like an idiot moving around in all the wrong ways for the first couple of tries. After a whle I did get the hang of it. I do know that the yoga routine moves a bit too fast for what yoga should be. You can burn fat with yoga without it being this intense. Also this video goes without proper discussion on breathing technique. If you like the yoga segment, I highly reccomend rocki's prenatal yoga series. there are three dvd's, the last two focus on labor and delivery which can really help someone who is too busy or impatient for those classes. All in all, if you are looking for a safe burn and healthy exercise in your pregnancy, i would say this one is adequate."
2,Not for Pregnant Beginners,High Impact aerobics. Enough to get a second trimester prego dizzy. Lots of dance steps with lots of arm movements. The seconds part of the video is easier to use and just as beneficial. I would recommend Tracy Mallet yoga for pregnancy as a much better way to go.
4,This video is great!,Liesa Hart realy makes you feel calm and and totaly relaxed. This is a great choise of exercise video. I realy recomend.
4,Good chapter selection and feels good,"I like the choices I have with this DVD. I can marry it well with the other exercising I am doing. If I need something more aerobic, I do the salsa dance, labor prep, and relaxation. If I need more stretching, I do the yoga fat burn, labor prep, and relaxation. Do take her advise and never skip the labor prep and relaxation. I feel great afterwards. Also, I am at the end of my first trimester and I never felt nauseous throughout this routine like I did with Yoga Journal. I attribute this to the pacing and the reminders to ""take my time."""
5,Hard at first but great,"This is a great all around workout. She really encourages you without being overly cheesey. She explains the exercises and tell you what mistakes to look out for. At first some of the moves are a little hard to get if you are as uncoordinated as me but once you do it a few times, you get it. Its not too hard but not too easy either. I hadn't exercised in a long time and I found this to be challenging but not overwhelming. Its broken down into four sections with two cardio workouts to choose from. I would recommend this to all preg moms that want to feel better and perk-up that lost energy."
2,Gets Boring!,"The salsa and the yoga moves are very repetitive, so it gets very boring very quickly. The yoga consists of mainly warrior poses, chair, and cat, which are repeated over and over. I got bored after the second time. Also I think the microphone is too close to her because she breathes very hard and it sound annoying.The stretching section was very brief, and it was at the end of the DVD. Im in my second trimester and I thought it was not challenging enough, although it may be challenging for the 3rd trimester mommies to be."
3,Just okay,"This workout is fine, but it's a bit repetitive - I've only done it twice, and I got really bored both times. Also, you need what is called a 'yoga ball' for the last bit - and I can't really find one the same size she uses anywhere..."
2,Boring,When I first started to do the workout I thought that it was great. Then it got really boring because you continually perform the same moves over and over again. I ended up shutting off the DVD before the workout was over because I was so bored.
3,too much,This looks like a great video and would be good for someone who is able to run around and allowed more aerobic exercise. I found it to be too much for me and a lot of the moves and exercises uncomfortable. The yoga parts and stretching were good.
2,Old Fashioned,"I'm 24, 19 weeks pregnant with baby #3. When I am not pregnant I do workout videos and run. This video is way too old school for me. I need something that actually makes me feel like I'm getting a work out and its worth it. I did break a little sweat doing this but I was just hoping for more. I know its not going to be like my other workout videos that I have for non pregnant people but I just think that in this day in age they could come up with some different techniques then just salsa dancing and doing the mamba...."
2,Old!,"Not a big fan because the video is clearly showing a sign of wear even thought it was ""brand new."" I'm just glad I got it cheep. The only reason I bought this video was for a quick workout on my 6th workout day. I wanted something easy to go along with the yoga I already have for my off day and a good recovery from my really challenging workouts. I have Lindsay Brin and Erin O'Brien which are way better and newer but this was a purchase to just shake things up:)"
3,"Ok, if you don't start your pregnancy already working out...",I thought this video was ok. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more dancing. If you are already working out and are in the early stages of your pregnancy this isn't very challenging. I am going to keep it for when I start showing and having more trouble moving around. It will probably work pretty well for that.
2,"Repetitive, boring, way too long","I personally didn't like this DVD. I found it to be repetitive and way too long. I didn't get a whole lot out of it. I realize weight loss is not my objective while being pregnant, but I thought I would get a little more stretching and strengthening than I did. I got totally confused on the breathing. I would be breathing out when you're supposed to be breathing in, so I ended up a little light-headed at the end. I never got the routine down and was constantly having to look at the TV to see where she was at, thus getting me out of a position I was supposed to be in. I'm not saying it's a bad DVD. It's gotten a lot of good reviews, which is why I bought it. I was just unhappy with the cardio and so-called yoga. I didn't like that ""ab"" workout, where you breath out and contract your ab muscles. It just didn't feel right. I just didn't feel right after doing this workout."
2,Very boring,I have 3 Lotte Berk Method DVDs and they are excellent. I thought those would be too intense for me now that I'm pregnant so I looked for a decent prenatal workout DVD. I found Fitmama very boring especially the breathing exercise. You can practise that anytime when you're not working out. The salsa also is a bit too fast to follow. I guess one has to take a while to get used to it.
4,Good workout!,"I bought this DVD along with Tracey Mallatt's Pregnancy system 3 in 1. I find this DVD a bit vigorous for me even though I've been working out for a few years before I got pregnant. But when u're pregnant, your body kinda slows down a bit and feel less energized. The moves are also a bit fast to follow but overall, I think the workout was pretty good.The salsa section was kinda fun and easy to follow. However, I thought the stretching section a bit too brief as I truly think I can benefit more from more stretching."
1,Too Easy,"I worked out prior to pregnancy, not as regularly as I should have, but a few days a week. And I got this in my first trimester, and it was so simple I couldn't believe it. I tried it twice since the first time and it was so boring and simple that I am now giving it away. I am sticking to my non pregnancy workouts and just skipping the floor parts, they actually work my muscles. Don't waste your money on this-if you want a simple workout, get a non pregnancy one that is basically dancing around, that way you can use it when you aren't pregnant also."
4,good workout-especially the salsa dance,The salsa dance was fun. It had basically 3 or 4 routines done over and over for 20 minutes with stretching of your calves and deep breathing at the end. I didn't care for the yoga portion. The last 2 sessions were way too easy. I recommend highly purchasing the dvd just for the salsa dance because it is fun and a good way to keep cardiovascularly fit during pregnancy without compromising safety and no modifications are necessary during the trimesters and no special equipment is required.
2,Boring and annoying,"I found this video to be both boring and annoying. For someone who wanted to stay physically fit during pregnancy, this video just doesn't cut it. It's not at all challenging, and it doesn't leave me feeling like I exercised at all. I think it would be a better video for someone who is not used to exercising a lot, and who just wants to do *something* while pregnant.I also found Leisa Hart to be very annoying, and my friends and I had to do this video on mute so we didn't have to hear the sound of her breathing. She breathes so loud!!! I know she is trying to remind the viewer to breathe by example, but it drove me crazy.I did the video 2-3 times and now it collects dust."
3,"The dancing is fun, but not challenging","I bought three pregnancy workouts: 1. Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout 2. Leisa Hart's Fit Mama 3. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 1.I have done all three and by far my favorite is Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout. It offers about 20 minutes of cardio, 15 mins of weight training, 5 min cooldown, and a relaxation/lamaze section. Of the three dvds it's the only one that really raised my heart rate and got me sweating a little bit, so I actually felt like I got a decent workout.Leisa Hart's Fit Mama is a fun workout because I enjoy dancing, but it really didn't challenge me. It is good to have on hand for days when your energy level may be low or you just want to dance and have fun!"
2,Okay exercise video,This video is best for beginner or beginner/intermediate exercisers. Intermediate and advanced exercisers will not find it challenging enough
4,salsa,"So, I've learned I don't like exercise video-too cheesy. BUT, when in need this was great. As an outside runner I don't like standing in front of a tv to do anything. However pregnancy and a rough winter have made my exercise of choice a non-option. So, this is great because it's easy and the workouts are pretty fast (20 min ea.). Sometimes I feel like it's not quite enough of a workout but there are ways to get in a bit extra."
3,What a workout,"I really liked the salsa dancing. The rest of the program i could live without. I found the fat burning workout too ""workouty"" and repetitive. Also, the way she breathes really got on my nerves. SHHH-SHHH-SHHHH...very loud. If you can get past that then you will be fine."
2,Not Very Impressed,"Five months pregnant, and finally over morning sickness, I wanted to start getting into shape--because healthy women generally experience better labor.I picked this video up (not from Amazon) and was disappointed in the ""yoga"" and the ""breathing"" exercises. Having done pilates and crunch pilates and some conditioning yoga (mostly Gaia brand), I found the ""exercises"" to be rather jerky, very faintly yoga-ish, and rather boring with few explanations."
2,A Little Boring,"I got this DVD at the same time I got the Buns of Steel DVD and after testing them both, this one has only been done twice. The salsa dancing is just too repetitive and not all that fun. And the yoga is fine, I am just not a yoga fan so it doesn't seem to do much good. It gives me a little bit of a workout, but I prefer Buns of Steel."
5,I really enjoyed this workout!,Leisa Hart's FitMama is a great way to stay in shape throughout your entire pregnancy! I highly recommend this video!
1,Terrible Video,"At first I got a kick out of doing the salsa video, but it actually started to make my lower back hurt more than it did before! The yoga part is NOT actually yoga. If you've ever done yoga before, then this is not for you! Her form is terrible!"
4,Good if you're looking for easy,"If you are used to working out, this video may be too easy for you. It is nice to have on days when you don't feel much like exercising though."
4,Little on the easy side but it works,"This video is a little on the easy side, but it's great for my legs and butt. For me, the workouts in this are better for the days when i don't have as much energy but know i have to workout. And she is very easy to follow along with; i never got lost in any steps."
4,Fast Moving,The DVD itself is great. I like that it is broken up into parts so you don't have to do the whole thing at once. It's very challenging and fast moving. The yoga music could be a little better. I was very disappointed on the delivery time which took over two weeks.
5,Love this Video!,"At 5 1/2 months pregnant, my left leg had really started aching while I sit at my desk at work all day. I propped up my feet and adjusted my chair but nothing seemed to help the pain. I bought this video after reading the reviews and I am so glad that I did. My leg stopped hurting after only one workout and I feel more energized. The salsa part is my favorite but the stretching makes me feel fabulous. The video is upbeat and fun and is not too difficult to follow, even for a beginner. I highly recommend this video."
4,Pretty good!!,"It wasn't what I had expected, but it is good. it got my heart rate up and the teacher was very friendly and outgoing. I had a difficult time with my nasea (since I am only two monthes along) but, that is my bad. I would deffinately tell a friend about this one, though!! Even my daughter has fun working out with me!! (she is only eighteen months old)"
3,Slow and Steady,"I am a very active person (non-pregnant), but found that I wasn't able to do the activities that I love while being pregnant. I saw this video online and it got really good reviews so I decided to try it out. It is a pretty decent video broken into four sections. There is a yoga segment (20 minutes), a salsa dance segment (20 minutes), and two stretching segments (8 to 10 minutes each). The yoga and salsa segments are fun, but they repeat the same moves over and over again. It's good to know that you're doing the right moves and not have to practice too much and also to feel comfortable since this big belly can make you off balance. However, I wish that I felt more of workout after doing the salsa or the yoga. My only complaint is that I am not working up a real sweat. Otherwise, it is a slow and steady workout to help you maintain fitness throughout pregnancy."
3,"Good, BUT. . .","This is not a very challenging workout, although it is fun, upbeat and easy to follow. The salsa dance part of the video made me feel sexy (which my husband enjoyed!) but it barely raised my heart rate, and neither did the yoga fat burn that comes after it. On the plus side, the labor and delivery stretches, which are bonus features, will probably be helpful during labor. The bottom line: if you're brand-new to exercising or need to exercise very gently, this workout would be great. Otherwise, you will most likely get a far better workout with something else."
3,Not GREAT!,"I don't really like this workout tape. I thought I would love it because I love salsa but the salsa section is boring and repetetive. The yoga section is also way to repetetive. The toning and relaxation are ok but could be better. I much prefer my other tapes over this one. I workout most days and only use this about once a week because I feel like I should so that I don't waste my money. I see others like it but for me, I wish I could get my money back."
1,Hated it,"Is this the same dvd that came out in 2003 with bad reviews?? Looks like they just gave it a new cover & publication year but it's still just as crappy! This workout is VERY REPETITIVE -- making you do squats & angle poses for 20 minutes, over & over & over -- too many repetitive squats will make your enlarging hips & thighs even bigger!! We want to TONE, not BUILD our muscles... If I wanted to do moves over & over again, I would get on a stairmaster and have more fun..."
5,BEST TREE WE HAVE EVER HAD FOR CHRISTMAS!,"This beautiful tree came in 4 days and we had it up in 4 hours in our living room. It is really easy to put together, and looks just lovely with all the lights on it. This is an excellent buy and we will enjoy it for years...! Thank you Amazon!"
2,Christmas Tree,"I was very disappointed with the quality of this Christmas Tree. The box was dilapidated and part of the tree was coming through the bottom of the box. When I opened the box, the tree section numbers were all laying in the bottom of the box, so I had to guess which section went where. When I got the tree together, a bulb on one of the lights was broken. I replaced it with one of the extras provided. One section of the lights did not burn, so I replaced the fuse, also provided, to make the lights burn. I have always been pleased with items I have purchased from Amazon, but this one was a real disappointment. I think the quality of the item should have matched the purchase price."
1,Please don't take this seriously...,"I picked up this book basically to have a good laugh.I heard the program ""Coast to Coast"", where a bunch of fringe loonies who have never met a conspiracy they didn't like...like to congregate and convince each other that THEY should be taken seriously.There is NO ""NIBIRU""...It's not ""hidden""...it's not being covered up by NASA scientists, IT DOES NOT EXIST!!!!!!ANYONE who's worked for the government(I have) KNOWS that if more than a few people have knowledge of a big ""secret""...it's not going to be a secret for long. Much of our astronomical knowledge has been gleened from amateur observers and therefore if a body as massive as this were to exist, the effects of it's presence would have been seen DECADES ago.It's all hocus pocus...and they assume you the reader will not/can not uderstand high school physics, and take them at THEIR word.A waste of paper, ink, and time.It should make good charcoal chimney starter though...so there's that!"
1,These Bulbs are Crap,"I bought a pair. They lasted a total of 4 months.Checked the electrical system, everything. Mechanic said they were just crappy bulbs."
4,cute,"I got this for my daughter who is 7. She enjoyed reading the ""story"" about the girl learning manners from her aunt. I think she probably paid more attention to the book's advice than she sometimes pays my advice. A good, basic book of manners."
2,disappointed,"I got what looked like a used book, the gloss on the cover was worn, there was a goober on it & inside was a sticky note for ""thurs- tiffs party friday - b for d"" No wonder they needed a manners book - anyone who reads a book & then sends it back for a refund is obviously clueless & gauche.The pages inside look like brochures sewed together- very cheaply made book. The format is all cramped & busy, cant image a little kid feeling drawn to read it- it repelled me.All in all I'm feeling ripped off- what were those other reviewers looking at? Childrens books are hard to buy, just because it has pictures doesnt mean they'll read it. If you're looking for a manners book then I would suggest looking at one at a book store.*** update: the seller refunded my money with an apology for sending a used rather than new book."
2,Great book - Poor condition,"The content of the book is wonderful. I would highly recommend this book to teach manners if you want your little girls to grow into young ladies. However, I was very disappointed with the condition of the ""like new"" used book that I purchased. I was going to give the book as a gift to my granddaughter but, after receiving the book, I could not. While the cover and pages were in excellent condition, when I opened the book, it was very upsetting when the binding let loose and all of the pages came out. I had to use packing tape on every page to put it all back together. I'm just keeping the book at my house to read to my granddaughters when they come to visit."
5,Love this Book,Love this little book will order again. My granddaughters love it too. I don't have any other words. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
4,Lovely and effective!,"My child went from exhibiting the most atrocious of table manners to conducting herself at table with perfect grace! After reading this book, she was eager for opportunities to practice her new manners on the telephone and at the table. Knowing ""the rules"" made her feel confident. Framing the need to be respectful of grown-ups as an issue of manners rather than power has made her rethink her behavior at school as well. Granted, this book takes an old-fashioned approach to proper behaviors (it is, for example, gender-specific, as the title clearly shows), but it has affected the way my behavior-challenged 6-year-old (though it's geared toward a slightly older audience) thinks about her actions. The illustrations are beautiful, and the prose -- from the perspective of a fictive childhood Emilie Barnes -- engages the socially-conscious child's mind. I only wish there were more, and that boys could be privy to this way of thinking about social interactions as well."
4,The lost art of manners,"I bought this book to read to my daughters, who are 4 and 6, and it's just too wordy for them at the moment. My 6 year old is definitely interested but my 4 year old loses interest a few paragraphs in. I usually find myself summarizing or using the book to give me guidance on teaching them the manners through practice rather than reading. If you are looking for an age reccomendation I'd definitely say 6+, and my 6 year old is very laid back and very interested in manners so even that might be a bit young.That said, it is a good book, it covers almost everything I could think of. Overall, I haven't found a better one and I think it's very important to teach our kids manners, even the ones that seem old-fashioned.I personally didn't care for the fact that it's told as a story, I did like how they broke things down into telephone manners, mealtime manners, ect. It's more personal preference than a flaw with the book."
1,My Least Favorite Angel Book So Far.,"This book is really boring. Nothing happens in this book, except for the last five pages. It's the same conversation over and over again for the 200 something pages. I almost fell asleep reading it. I hope the next one, ""Solitary Man"" is better."
4,Nocturne - not a Coaster in my Books,"CGW just gave this game ""Coaster of the Year"" award. Some of those reasons are obvious - 1. The hardware requirements are extreme. I found the game slowing down on my PII/400-128meg-TNT2 Ultra-full install, at times. The graphics are nothing short of amazing. If you have a system to push it, you wont be sorry on the graphics end. 2. The camera changes are difficult to get used to. It seems the creatures tend to wait until your just about to change views to attack. I would have to disagree with CGW on this one, I found the game very enjoyable. Its been a while (sence DOOM, i think) sence I've had a game scare the bejesus outa be, and Nocturne did that on a number of occasions(be sure to imense youself in the game by turning all the lights off). Though the game really has no end result your trying to acomplish, its still a winner in my books."
2,frustrated,"The game has beautiful graphics and superb sound but very bad player interaction and controls. Some of the sequences are downright scary when played at night and in the dark. However when you realize how hard it is to aim a weapon, see the monsters or direct your motion from the clumsy third person perspective you quickly tire of the game."
3,Great graphics but suffers from lousy controls,First off you need a very fast system to run this game (it runs fine on my PIII 500 but lags on my neighbors PII 400). The story is noteworthy but seems to borrow heavily from the Resident Evil series. The graphics are outstanding and the sounds will scare the socks off you especially if you play the game at night or with all the lights off alone. But from here on out the game takes a turn for the worse as the controls and camera views are sloppy and erratic and at times just plain frustrating. It still is a fun game to play and the goosebumps and chills that I recieved from playing were very much from getting the crap scared out of me. Overall the controls are annoying but the game still has its moments so if you like the scary genre type game it is still well worth purchasing.
3,Very Interesting,"Beautiful graphics, good story, nice voices....unfortunately the control factor shoots this one in the foot. Nocturne takes its control queue from the 3D shooters, the only problem is that it is not a 3D shooter and the gameplay suffers because of this. Still, all in all, it is an interesting play. Worth a buy."
2,Coaster of the year!,"Before I bought this game, I downloaded the demo off theinternet and was completely freaked out. I rushed out and purchasedthe game and was completely freaked out by the money I wasted. Do you love impossible control options, very high system requirements and load times that have you kicking your computer? Then you will love Nocturne! This game had all the perfect elements to become a great game, but it fell short on delivery. However, if you love the Resident Evil genre, then this game is for you, but I warned you. END"
3,Hard plastic,I read the reviews but kept thinking I'd like it better than I did. The hard plastic is a bit of a bummer and the fin you pull back on is a little hard. It's ok. Nothing impressive. Ironically my mom had my daughter at Walmart the other day and she saw a rubber shark and wanted that one-she hasn't even touched this one since.
1,broke within first five minutes,"My son loved this when he received it for Christmas, it lasted five minutes before the jaws no longer snapped open. Don't waste your money. It's a shame it was a great idea but not well made. My son is 8 and he handled it with care, now he has a plastic shark that does nothing.update: My husband unscrewed the shark and was able to fix the problem at least for now. So I changed my rating to three stars. It's a nice toy when it works, if we hadn't had a problem with it, I would have given it 4 stars. Inside the shark the trigger is made of plastic which slipped off the plastic groove, we were able to get it back on and with a little bending of the plastic we could get it to stay on. So, Jaws is biting again!"
1,not worth the money-broke in 10 minutes,"My 8 yr old son wanted this, we purchased it and waited over 2 weeks only to find out that the seller put the wrong address on the package. so 3 weeks after purchase we finally got it. My son was so excited to get the shark played with it for about 10 minutes and my 3 yr old picked it up and barley tossed it across the floor(carpet) and the head fell off.After dealing with a very upset 8 yr old who had waited 3 weeks on this toy, i attempted to put it back together but failed. the shark is now somewhat intact but its not functioning at all. the jaws no longer snap and there is a gap between the head and body. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!! The second a kid dropps this shark it will fall apart and you will have upset kids!!!!"
2,Broken Jaw,This was just what my grandson was looking for except that the motion devise broke the second day that he had it.
2,Sucky,This gun is a piece of crap. It only has 50 rounds and 2 mags. that is horrible for a machine gun. My friend has this gun and he always lost because he ran out of amo. It has no long distance accuracy and it just plain out sucks. It is a good starter gun I guess.And this gun doesnt hurt at all.
4,The Joy Diet Book,"Great book for moving ahead or finding your true goals in your journey through life. It is sometimes intense and helps you soul search, if you are ready for that. I just love it! It has helped me to focus on the important things and I am learning to have a better, happier and balanced life. Thank you!"
5,Faith in your heart,"This book showed me the secret truth my heart already knew...that the key to finding your home is to follow what your heart tells you, come what may. Sensationally insightful book. Highly recommended with an even stronger recommendation for Beck's Following Your Own North Star. Caution: her message is powerfully redemptive but not for the fainthearted."
5,Simple and Fun!,"Self Help for Managing the Symptoms of Borderline Personality DisorderI love how simple and easy to use this book is! Martha is, once again, right on :-)Tami Green[..]"
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good inspirational read. Glad I read it, but not something I re-read parts of like I do the books by Esther & Jerry Hicks."
