1,"A toy, not a camera","Save your money. Poor picture quality, just not enough pixels for a decent image. A flash might make it tolerable for limited web usage, but without its only suitable for outdoor shots, and those won't be good. Light, flimsy plastic, looks and feels like its from the toy dept, not photo.The more your budget is limited, the more research you should do to get the most for your money. Look for something w/ a flash and more pixels. There are many photo review sites to supplement the info here. And pay more attention to the reviews of people who've had the equipment longer - it's easy to have contagious enthusiasm for a brand new toy."
1,Making Money Out Of Sufferring?,You should be ashamed of yourself for making a profit out of the suffering of cancer patients. You call yourself a LICSW? If you really cared you'd be giving it away. I'm a cancer survivor and I'm personally offended by this.
5,"Excellent, excellent Book.","This should be a must read for all! Easy to read, but you will needyour highlighter to re-read some passages that require a little deeper thinking."
4,Consciousness Tools,"Thank you Gregg for helping wake people to the matrix of energy we all share.There is no escaping that ""all is one"". Anyone interested in books that search quantum physics/science for an explanation of the Divine, Spirit, unifying energy of One will enjoy this book. Caryn Colgan, Ancient Pact"
5,The DIVINE MATRIX,"This is a good read on the science/spirit marriage that has finally happened. Via the matrix we are all joined, so it's high time to practice the golden rule and upgrade what we think and feel in our hearts..because we (and all others)get back what we put forth. Mankind today, IS the missing link..we can stop digging! What we can evolve into from here will make modern man look like a spiritual neanderthal!"
3,Some useful key points make it worth reading.,"The first half of the book was enjoyable, and relayed to me some key findings such as how DNA can influence space/matter, the role of emotions, and some experiments that had been done in physics. I don't mind that these aren't mainstream.. the conclusions are logical.However, the second half of the book (related to mirrors) and Gregg's set of ""laws"" and experiences was a little drawn out. I didn't expect new age psychology and counseling stories to be contained in a book about scientific discoveries related to the universe. The style was a little too typical and of the ""here's the story and moral, now we should all act like this.. "" you find in new age books (esp ""Hay House"" publications).Overall, the book is worth a read since it reminds us of the role of emotions and thought in daily life and how this affects the universe, but don't expect anything too earth-shattering or new."
2,"Regurgitated Philosophy, No Real Science","Unfortunately, it is clear to me (a physicist who is an expert on the scientific side of this) that the author does not understand modern physics. This is not in any way a scientific work or argument, and it is filled with problematic reasoning, illogical arguments, and complete fallacies. It does *sound* good, and I can see how someone that was not a scientist could easily fall for this... in fact, psychologically, his theory could be ""fun"" to believe in, and I can see why people would like to believe that this is true, just as children like to believe in Santa Claus. It is an important work though, if for no other reason that it is being read by so many people."
3,"A little hard to follow, but good.","I haven't quite finished this book, but so far, it's sometimes a little beyond my comprehension. But I will continue."
2,"Some interesting ideas, some not on point","Some good ideas and interesting discussion but I think the author is far off on a couple of points.He infers we intentionally (though we don't know it) foul up at times so we can start over and do better, even though our mistakes are costly and hurt others. He also says men are often attracted to women that they just meet because they see things in the women that they wish they had. No proof is offered and his reasoning is thin. Both ideas have no foundation and could result in harm and the hurting of others."
2,Divine Matrix,"I don't know why I should waste my time and write a review. Unless they are extremely flattering and helps you sell the book, you simply delete them. I have written a couple review that don't stay on your board for very long. If you want someone to write flattering reviews, do it yourself. Thank you."
4,"Great, current review of the subject","Gregg Braden did a really good job with this one. It is very up to date and presented in a very organized fashion. I would have given him 5 stars but I gave four because I thought some parts could have been a little better written. Though most of it is written very well, in a very easy to understand manner.To be honest I just came from the store and read more than half of it there! I couldn't put it down. It flowed very well and covered everything that I would have been expected with the given subject material. I am an avid reader on this subject so I should know! Great job Mr. Braden! Already looking forward to reading your next one! keep up the great work :-)"
3,Get you Thinking,"There are some realy interesting items in here, especially on the experiments. I felt the book got a little much towards the end, but I beleive it is worth a read for you to form your opinion."
2,Where's the Proof?,"Saying something exists, and demonstrating it, are light years apart, and there was no Divine Inspiration in this tome to render the Light. I get the idea that we are all connected by the Divine, and therefore will live foreover, etc. etc...But its really all just speculation, unprovable, and not that different from the religious dogma underlying Christianity or Islam. Why some people are impressed, and buy this book (I borrowed it from the local library) is what fuels all religious belief - the need, as Ernest Becker (Denial of Death, 1973) to repress the consciousness of death."
4,The Divine Matrix,This book arrived quickly and in much better condition than I expected. There were only two marks inside the book. I am reading a lot of Gregg Braden's work right now. He is getting very close to the Real Deal. He's just missing a few key things. I admire his research abilities - they are phenomenal.
4,Is it possible?,"Scott Braden states that if merely 8000 inidviduals on the planet achieve peace and project peace from our inner stillnes - aka devine matrix, sometimes called God consciousness, the Gap or nirvana space, we can heal the planet. He backs up this statement with science - quantum theory. Finally spirituality and science come together. Very powerful book. Only odd thing is that the book goes along nicely for several chapters then diverts for several and returns in the final chapter to resolve the first chapters. Regardless, this book provides great hope for humanity and our beloved planet."
5,The stuff that holds IT all together,"Gregg Braden is so refreshing. He is a perfect blend of the scientific, spiritual and he practices the lost art of common sense. This book is a blessing to me. Read it only if you are willing and able to expand your beliefs about this journey we are all on."
5,"Brilliant,scholarly,visionary!","Gregg Braden in his newest and to date finest work,The Divine Matrix, has offered a concise,scholarly,scientific,and visionary perspective on who we are,our undeniable connection to everything,and most importantly our powerful role in our present lives and thus the future of our existence.Braden's extensive experience and background in the hard sciences, his research,and ability to work with experts in related fields gives this book the scholarly backbone and foundation we all can depend on.I not only recommend The Divine Matrix ,I find it to be essential to understanding our relationship to ourselves,each other and the world we live in.Briliant,precise,and an offering of the highest integrity-as always!HBFounder, Future of Health Worldwide"
5,All that exists has a basic vibration; all is connected.,"I expected this to be just a repeat of Braden's other books, as a few are in the past, but I did find some new exciting information, although I was already aware through my personal insight that the Divine Matrix is just simply a primal vibration from which all other vibrations emanate and create. However, this book laid out practical ways to use these connections and hence, gives one a stronger belief in what one can do by using the vibrations that can be sent out by our minds. It gives me hope that perhaps a few people with strong intent and minds can actually change some of the chaos and misery in this world. It is on that premise that I live my life and his book bolsters my belief and actions."
3,Great Promise- Weak Delivery,"Well, first the negative critique. I was disappointed that the book was not meatier. Braden takes forever to make a statement and doesn't really come up with anything new. This book advertises some of his other works a bit too frequently. This book is too tedious, repetitious, and slow to hold most people's interest. If the reader is brand-new to quantum physics and consciousness theory, this book might simply prevent them from further exploration.On the positive side, it is a feel good book. It can be compared with a movie you don't want to rent or own, but will enjoy watching on television on a lazy rainy day. If the reader is brand-new to quantum physics and consciousness theory, this book might be a gentle introduction.Also, the book seems to be a synopsis of Braden's work. You can become acquainted with his entire body of work by reading this one book. That's handy."
5,I like this,Braden really breaks some new ground. The book puts together in a pretty cohesive way what we all know at some level. That we are all connected.
4,An extremely good read!,"This book was a well written description of how powerful emotions, feelings, and beliefs are. Gregg did an excellent job in tying everything together on a scientific level. He gave plenty of examples of scientific experiments that have been conducted that support the Divine Matrix.This book definitely pushes your imagination and ways of thinking to the limits!!! It was amazing to even visualize some of the possiblities that is believed by many to exist within each of us.I was a believer before but now I believe on a whole different level. I loved the first 2 parts of the book, the 3rd was a little slow to me and that is the only reason why I didn't give the book a perfect 5 stars.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind that has the desire to educate themselves on how their mind, beliefs, emotions and science are intertwined!"
2,I forced myself to finish,Like many books of this type the author tries to get quantum mechanics and entanglement to mix with faith healing and psycho-kenitics. I learned nothing new.
5,Let the Walls Fall Down!,"This CD contains a collection of piano music along with a selection of vocal tracks accompanied by the piano. Pianist Joshua Tuburan performs on all tracks, and his arrangements of favorite Christian hymns and praise songs makes for a delightful listening experience. The maturity level heard on this CD may cause some listeners to question that the artist is really only a college graduate. However, Josh Tuburan's talent does indeed far exceed his years as he brings together a powerful presentation of music that will enrich and bless the lives of an audience with varied tastes. The music is classically based, but it does include some jazz and contemporary sounds. Overall, Jericho undoubtedly will provide listeners with many hours of enjoyment."
2,Looks Like a Factory Second,"Mine arrived with several blemishes on the back or ""spine"" of the blade - nothing to effect cutting performance - just enough to make it look cheap and unfinished. I've had a similarly designed knife from a different mfg. that did not have those problems."
1,junk,"this is junk. it should be made of better steel and have a sharp, non-serrated edge.i ground out the serrations which improved the knife somewhat but the steel is so crappythat it doesn't hold the edge very well."
1,sad,i bought with high hopes and it barly works. you cant see a thing threw this camera. i bought a 5 doller one that worked better(not great but better)
2,Don't waste your money.,"This ""batter"" did not cook all the way through, leaving the center doughy and gross. You are better off making it from scratch, it is faster and the end result is better."
1,Churros Mix,"Not to my liking... I was better off finding a recepie and making my own. Doughy flavor, cinnamon and sugar wasnt enough to mask the flavor, hard to cook thoroughly, so thick that it was difficult to dispense from bag provided and tip of bag didn't stay in to dispense properly due to thickness."
3,Unaccurate Instructions,"It brings a pastry bag and a star tip to mold churros as they are, but I must say that the instructions are very unreliable, I had to use almost twice the water, otherwise it would be too hard to pass through the small tip. At the end, we enjoyed sugar dusted churros with a warm cup of chocolate."
3,it was a ok brand of flour,This was a ok brand but think it could have been better for the price Better to just look up a recipe and make your own
1,A re-release of the awful Stuttgart ring?,"It isn't clear from the description, but judging by the conductor, list of players and the fact that it was performed at the Stuttgart Statsoper, I suspect this is a re-release of the 2004 Stuttgart ring (now out of production).Be warned - this is not only an unconventional Ring - it's also a unsuccessful one. The concept was to use a separate director for each opera in the cycle: a bold concept which fails utterly.Feel free to buy a copy out of curiosity, but don't expect much. It typifies the worst of Regietheater."
5,Fram Air Hog,"Filter seems to work just as well as the competition's filter, but at a better price! Great product for performance seeking thrifty buyers!"
3,"Okay, But poor when you compare it to the other six season",The first six seasons were very funny. This season missed the comedy and at times was disappointing. This season was more like a drama and not at all like the first six seasons.
5,Great!,Fried our first turkey this past Thanksgiving and this set was great! Not sure it would have been as easy without this product. The rack was large enough to hold our 16 lb turkey and was easy to use and clean!
4,Bayou classic Accessories,It worked for my outdoor turkey fryer. The flavor injection needle was a little flimsy but did the job enough to get my 20 lb turkey cooked & it would hold up a couple more times for this.
3,It worked for what it is,This item is a little flimsy. The rack is weak but it worked ok for frying a turkey. I think it is more suited for lighter pieces of meat. Next time I will get a different style though.
4,good holder,works great for getting the turkey out of the fryer we put a small can beside the holder and put in some beer to keep the turkey moister
1,Get what you pay for,Bayou classic 0835 Complete Poultry Frying RackOrdered to fry a 12 pound for Thanksgiving. Hanger is very small and requires you to be very close to pot when lowering turkey into pot. Stand is flimsy and bent the first time I tried to set the turkey on it. Thermometer and Injector are ok.I would recommend getting a more heavy duty system.
5,Perfect for frying that turkey,"This is a cool product and allows for flexibility with its adjustable spikes. Good quality materials, easy to use and clean."
4,Works great,Got this for 2012 thanks giving because my other turkey stand broke last year. I used it with a 16# turkey with no problem. This is a good deal for the setup. I have not used the chicken skewers yet but looking forward to it.
2,Rather Poor Reproductions,"An earlier reviewer made some very nice comments about the text of this book--something I'm unqualified to address because I did not read the words. My focus was on the paintings themselves, which are not well reproduced here. I have seen these same paintings in other books, and the paintings are indeed beautiful. Here, however, the colors are washed-out. If you just need a general representation of Monet's paintings, this book might do. But if you want a much truer view of these great works, look elsewhere."
5,Great Book!,"This book is great. I love how it makes this topic easy to read and not extremely boring or painful to get through. The illustrations, while elementary, are very helpful. Would recommend this book!"
1,"Nice bridge, but it listed with the HO scale products","Much too big for my HO layout! Please take ad out of HO. I, with great difficulty, cut it down to size. I changed this to one star. Why? Amazon is not paying attention. It is still with the HO scale products after a month and a half."
3,Train trestle,Inadequate installation instructions. Need to include instructions for gluing parts together and should include glue as well.
5,Brian Overland outdid himself!,"I have read Brian's other book: ""C in Plain english"" as well as ""C++ in Plain English"". Honestly, I think he did a very good job!.He has a good balance between technical details & overview of the big picture. I often find that a lots of C++ books lead their readers into leaves; this book stripped all leaves & show the woods. I recommended this book to be read first before diving into the chasms of C++!"
5,Great Reference Book... It Covers Everything!,"If you are looking for a straight forward bookthat has everything about C++, this is the bookfor you."
4,compared to a college class,"I read this book while taking a class in C and FORTRAN at my university. The class and the recommended texts were of little help to me, and so I had to rely on outside sources of information. Having never learned a programming language in the past, it was extremely beneficial to me to have things explained bluntly without a condescending tone. This author does not assume the reader is an idiot, merely uninformed, and so educates the reader in a couple of days to what could take weeks in a classroom setting."
2,Too much plain english,"Yes, the book explains C++ in plain English. A LOT of plain english. Too much for my liking. There was so much unrelated wordage in there that the on-topic writing got thrown at you without reasonable explanation. There is little reference to how to use a command, only an overdose of why.While reading the book, I attempted to write simple C++ programs based on what was being covered, most of which failed miserably. When I re-read the related material again, I still found no hope of learning what I was doing wrong. Even after typing code exactly as it comes out of the book, it still did not work.If you want to learn C++ don't read this book. It will leave you more confused after reading it than you were before you picked it up."
3,"Not complete, but a good stepping stone.","Why is everyone reviewing this book as if it's for C++? It teaches *C*, and it teaches it pretty well, to beginners. If you find other books abstruse, try this one, and then go back to the abstruse one to complete your C education. Basically, it's a good stepping stone."
3,"Not Specific, But Informative","This book gives a general overview of most areas in C++. This was the first book that I read while I was teaching myself C++. It is a good book to introduce topics, but to really understand the C++ language I would recommend a book such as C++ Primer, by Stanley B. Lippman."
2,Does not cover C++ Library and STL (MAJOR OMISSION),"I was searching for the ideal C++ reference, and was pleased with this book until I went to look up info on iterators and strings. I was horrified to discover that all info on the C++ Standard Template Library was left out!! Imagine that on a 3rd edition book copyrighted in 2001!Its chapter on ""C++ Strings"" talks about *gasp* C-Style strings (ASCIIZ, terminating with '\0') instead of the elegant C++ string class. The ""template"" feature is well covered, but it ignored the fact that there are already wonderful containers for your use.Yes, the book reads well with good style, but is a ""C++ as a better C"" book instead of a ""C++ Language"" reference. The size, price, formatting and usefulness is what other books lack (although I would also nit-pick about creating thumb-tabs for the C-library reference section too). Too bad this book lacks the content of the other books."
3,You might need another book.,"It uses to much C-style syntax(code). I would recommend Practical C++, C++ for Dummies, or maybe even C++ for idiots.The Sams teach yourself are not bad either.But read the book over at a nearby bookstore if your thinking about purchasing it."
4,Good For Jumping From C to C++,"This is really two books in one. The first section is a collection of keywords and functions (for reference). The second part is a quick run-down of C++ (a tutorial). The tutorial is great if you know C and are new to C++. I read it in an evening and it gets you up to speed. The reference is pretty good too. Although, once you've finished the tutorial you kinda want to take it out so you can just have the reference part.The reference part is exactly what it should be. Short descriptions and a quick example. Thorough (for what it covers), quick and easy to use. If only you could separate it from the Tutorial.I like it! Worth the price especially if you're looking for a quick jump from C to C++"
5,loved it!,"I purchased this particular book because I wanted the articles about Grand Forks, North Dakota. When I received it and read those specific ones first, then I went back and started at the beginning...and could barely put it down. Mr. Barry is one of our favorite writers and always has us in stitches about some of the things he comes up with.I wish I had his quick wit and fantastic humor. : )"
4,Re-read this to re-live the year 2000 and all its quirks,"I always trust Dave Barry to provide me with some quality laughs, and this book does not disappoint. He covers the 2000 presidental campaigns and conventions, the Florida election counting debacle, the winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and a bunch of regular weekly columns from that time period.Barry concludes with two amazing columns about September 11th. These are stunning. When I was searching for reading material/commentary in those days immediately post-9/11, I wish I had found these columns. His ability to write to Americans in the face of tragedy proves his true depth and talent as a columnist. (Yes, he actually writes about moore than just boogers.)"
4,"""The Booger Beat"" would be a great name for a rock band!","This latest collection of Dave Barry's humor columns is predictably and uniformly hilarious. Barry has always had the knack of surprising the reader no matter how familiar his formula is. The collection is made all the more valuable with the inclusion of two serious columns about 9/11. These are as sensitive, even elegaic, as anything anybody else wrote about that horrible day. He wisely puts them at the end, for fear of ruining any gags that would follow them. Another top-notch collection from south Florida's funniest (funny on purpose, that is) character."
4,How Do You Read a Book With No Words?,"How do you read a book with no words? The same way you did before you learned how to read - you look at the pictures...What do you see?The sun comes up over the hills on a still winter's morning. It seems we're in New England. The book's protagonist, something of a Yankee babushka, is nestling under her very warm covers. Her pets, a fat feline and a common looking brown hound, are just beginning to stir...The morning ripens with potential as the thought of a tall stack of fluffy pancakes enters the mind of our lady of the house. So begins a quest, and several unexpected obstacles will have to be surmounted before desire ultimately is fulfilled.My eldest daughter, now in college, remembers this book as one of her favorites. I asked her what stands out after all these years. It's the golden blob of butter, centered on the top of each tall stack.For this, a recommendation of four stars certainly seems in order."
5,Story without words,"I ""read"" this wordless picture book to a class of 2nd graders and they loved predicting what would happen next in the story. Tomie dePaola has frame by frame pictures of the pancake making process. Some students didn't get what she was doing at first, but as the storyline progressed, they understood. The kids were so excited to get to the end of the story, they were surprised that they hadn't guessed the ending.This is also a great story to give children/students who have speech problems or problems staying focused on a storyline. It gets them thinking and ""Pancakes for Breakfast"" is made into 'their own little story'."
3,You read the pictures,The story has no words but you can tell what it's about just by the pictures. So it's a book for all people that don't even have to know the English language.
2,Just a picture book,I was disappointed that there was not any words to read to my kid. I wish that the description would have told me that
1,Pancakes for Breakfast,I love this book that is why I bought it. But regretfully I must say it has been a month from when I have ordered it and I have yet to receive it for that I am very disapointed.
4,Just pictures..no words,"Cute, cute book but I was a little surprised that were no words, just illustrations. Since this is the case, my son and I make up our own words which has been quite fun."
3,my knife came dull,I ordered this knife after months of searching for knives I decided to start out with the paring knife I even chose one day shipping I was so excited to get it...well it looks good but my knife came dull as a stick that might not be a problem with most people I imagine you'll just whip out your nifty stones and sharpen away...for me it was a bit of a let down I read so many reviews about people complaining that the knifes are too sharp which sort of makes me giggle but I tried this on an apple and it wouldn't go through so I downgraded to butter and that hardly worked finally I whipped out a strawberry and that worked roughly I ran my finger across the blade and expected at the very least a wee nick but nope nothing so this is going back...it's nothing against global I am ordering another knife from them but I would have liked it to come sharpened.
3,Smells good for awhile,I love the variety of pieces - -large and colorful but the fragrance doesn't last very long. I would have expected several months but got about 3 weeks.
5,For Many Moods,This CD has multiple appeals according to your mood. The music and vocals gives you strength and awareness that everything is part of a process.
4,Magic pencils...,"Funny, my son and I liked it. Bear goes to town with a magic pencil, makes friends with Cat, saves cat and a variety of other animals from a guarded camp (Animal Control? funny place to find cows, though), and draws an idyllic hillside for these animals to occupy. The illustrations are quirky and unexpected, while the tone of the book is calm, almost somnabulistic. It does seem to have an underlying theme about harm to animals, but it is deeply placed, and my child was much more concerned with the clear ""good and evil"" parameters he's familiar with from fairy tales."
1,Dark and disturbing,"My 5 and 3 year olds didn't seem to be too troubled by this book, but I found it dark and disturbing. What starts out as a seemingly typical children's story takes a sudden and scary turn. I have to think that the only reason they weren't more scared is that they are too young to know anything about World War II and the death camps. But even without that metaphor, the illustrations are disturbing in themselves. Skulls, razor wire, dark figures... it's just not what I consider appropriate for a children's book. The ""magic pencil"" story could easily have been told with less threatening villians and more age-appropriate illustrations. I found myself searching the book's dust jacket for why on earth the author would choose to create a book like this for young children."
1,I found this book quite curious- and frankly very disturbing,After reading this to my daughter I was intriqued to search for more information concerning the author's intent and message. Animals getting harmed and going to a prison camp don't seem to be the kind of story I want to read to my 17 month old.
3,Wrong Color,"I ordered THIS one. The gray one. The picture is deceptive. The actual color is dark gray almost black and not white as the picture leads you to believe. Other then that, it's ok. Do you really need 2600 Joule protection?"
4,Great For Your Do-It-YourSelfer,"This is the book you need if you want to install or refinish your harwood floor. And the author even covers his views on water based finishes.In addition, I recommend only using a continuous belt sander. The author mentions the benifits, but the sheet fed causes chatter marks. GO WITH THE BELT! The belt sanders can be harder to find, but look for it."
2,"Adequate, not too exciting","Compared to the reams of information that is readily available on the interent, this book was a bit of a disappointment. The author clearly knows his craft, but the approach is perhaps a bit dated and less useful to the adventursome DIY'r than what I found on a few instricutional WWW-sites (they're easy to find with most any search engine)."
5,CANT GO WRONG FOR THE PRICE.,"I purchased this to learn how to install hardwood floors in my home. I believe i paid about 15 dollars total with shipping. The book wont make you a hardwood pro, but will give more than a sufficient foundation to install flooring. Its an older book but the techniques being used today are still the same. I found it very helpful especially for determining the starting points, and how to measure and or come up with a starting point. I had a hallway, stair bull nosing and a living room on my install with no breaks between. Overall its a good book and it is a good purchase to learn and tackle hardwood flooring."
3,"Hardwood Floors: Laying, Sanding and Finishing","An informative book, but I merely learned how to install hardwood flooring in the author's house after reading it and watching the DVD (extra $). Really important topics, such as initial measuring and layout, were skimmed over.I wound up hiring a professional to install my flooring instead. ugh!"
5,Helped me Successfully Install my Hardwood Floor,"Very practical and useful guide to installing a hardwood floor. I would not have had as great a result without it. If you are installing or thinking about installing a hardwwod floor, get this book. It gives you all of the tips and tricks to do the job properly. Well worth the price."
3,a little dated.,I purchased this book hoping to find information about refinishing my hardwood floors. This book will be helpful in getting an overall view of hardwood floors and refinishing. It does seem to be a bit dated. My understanding is that most DIY'ers use a random orbital sander. The book refers mostly to a drum sander which can easily cause damage to floors when used by amateurs like me.
3,Book provided some help but found more information on you tube. I read it but already knew most information.,Book provided some help but found more information on you tube. I read it but already knew most information supplied from the floor provider.
2,flooring project,The book was outdated.Wrote in 1990.I got very little info from it.There is more info on the web..
1,not worth it.,"You can find the information on the internet or from any place that sell hardwood. I thought the book would show you to do special thing, but ... nothing useful."
4,An Important Read,"This overview of Michael Oakeshott's work is an important addition to 20th century philosophy's wardrobe of characters. Oakeshott is critical to the understanding of integrationalist thinking, and this work presents a very balanced critique of his life and work.If you're a student of the history of philosophy, or curious about the philosophers who seem lost in the maze of major names...this biographical survey of Oakeshott's work will be a refreshing read for you."
1,Financial farce!,"Sure, Deaton has the key to financial freedom: Write a nonsensical book in a preacher's tone and give it a provocative title. Unfortuantely, it is the unsuspecting financial novice who ends up on the short end of the deal. Any words of wisdom that Deaton has to share are lost in his sermon about the acquirement and accumulation. His quest to be funny feels more like an insult."
2,Zorro gone bad!,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this costume, however my grand-children loved it. They were very excited to wear the get-up and upset thay it has not lasted through their playing.I love doing business with Amazon and will continue to buy products thur them."
2,Struggled to finish,"After reading ""When Bruce ment Cyn"" I was looking foward to reading ""The Secret Life of Bryan"" by Lori Foster. Byant has switch places with his twin brother Bruce when Bruce is beaten up for trying to help former ladies of the night Shay Sommer has called by press the ""Crown Princess"" for all the good works that she does. When Bryan mistakes Shay for a hooker, she decides to stay to try to help others. Bryan wants Shay, but he can't believe he wants her and his confuse by this.I really wanted to like ""The Secret of Bryan"" but I found that is was a struggled to finish it. This book just didn't see like a Lori Foster book, it lacked the romance of other book by Ms. Foster, I sorry that I spent the money I did for this book."
3,"For a real ""fairy tale""...","Call me crazy but I like the type of chick lit that also seems somewhat believable. This is not it. I rolled my eye more than anything while reading this. Although it is well written and somewhat entertaining (really only near the end.) I may pick up this author again as others have said this is not quite like her normal work. If you are looking for something that is fun... romantic yet funny and entertaining (and maybe even believable), check out Janet Evanovich, Whitney Gaskell, or Beth Kendrick."
1,"Didn't finish, Don't Want to...","It seemed an interesting idea, a man posing as his brother who is a minister. A woman posing as a prostitute in order to help them. What I didn't get is why Shay wants to help the prostitutes (very little background into something that is supposed to be her passion), why she thinks that no one will accept the help that she is willing to offer, and why oh why would a woman would so boldly try and seduce a preacher when it could put both of them in compromising positions. I got about half way through the book before I realized that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters and was more than happy to leave my questions unanswered."
1,secret life of bryan,"I couldn't finish this book , love lori foster but this was the most boring book i have purchased. Sorry but to me who was able to read over 1,000 books last year alone this was a waste of my time and money. I read everything i can so i it wasnt just the author but the whole wanting to keep skipping pages to find anything interesting that got me deleting it without finishing.."
4,I probably would not have liked this book so much without,"watching Secret Millionare on TV. This kind of had the same feel to it. Shay has money and wants to do the right thing with it. Bryan, posing as his brother Bruce, mistakes her for a hooker. Personal growth follows. The story would have been better without the visit to Visitation; I thought that was unnecessary but overall I liked it. I do admit that I may not have felt the same about it had I read it back in 2004."
5,Powered Up,"I thought my cordless Makita stapler was broken, but all it needed was a new battery. After a few hours' charge, my stapler was back in operation with this new battery. Great product delivered promptly. I'm happy."
2,A lot more noise than suction,"I was a bit disappointed in the usability of this Dirt Devil. I tried it in various settings: car, fireplace mantle, hardwood floor, carpeted steps, etc. The suction is not that great and I found it bulky and unwieldy. It is certainly not ""Extreme Power"". I have never been a big fan of handhelds and I thought this one would change my mind, but alas, it did not."
5,good rechargeable vac,We have had several rechargeable vacs and this one does the best job. It's powerful and effective. I would recommend buying it.
3,"Not Great, Not Bad Either","Maybe I'm wrong, but I assumed with all that horse power it could swoop up a few frozen peas that fell out of the package on my kitchen floor. Eventually it did, but it took time for the machine to take up the peas. The second time it was used was to pick up stray pieces of wheatgrass after it had been cut, and again, you had to work at it. So, it's not as good as described, but perhaps it would do better on something else. What, I'm not sure."
3,Somewhat Satisfied,"The inlet opening is small, compared to my previous B&D dust buster, and the placement of the brush, which is always somewhat active (even in the retract mode), sometimes gets in the way of some jobs. The device clogs easily if you have dog hair. I tried to pick up one wet spot in the carpet and wasn't too thrilled with the job it did. Suction generally is decent for dry materials."
2,Not as practical as its brandmates,"This ""wet/dry"" handvac is a mixed blessing. It has a charging dock that fits so tightly that it requires more effort than expected to disengage. Its suction, for the voltage, is less than other similar products. In its ""wet"" application, it does not beat a towel, etc. Reassembly after use is a challenge. As a ""dry"" vac, it can not keep up with its red dry-only counterpart."
5,Works great,"This was a gift to a new Mom. I think they use it more than they expected and so I think it was a great gift. The ""wet"" feature is handy to have and comes in handy"
2,Not satisfied,"I am not satisfied with this product, it cleans very well but... lot of micro dust is coming out from the air exit vent. I am planning to return this product."
3,Extreme Power ???,"Hello-ooo.Is this false advertising or merely stupidity?Volts are not power! Amps are not power!Watts are power. One horsepower is 746 watts.Think about the engine in your automobile, whichis measured in horsepower.Dirt Devil Extreme Power Wet/Dry Cordless Hand Cleaner - M0944"
1,THE most aggravating machine EVER!,"Dirt Devil Extreme Power Wet/Dry Cordless Hand Cleaner - M0944This is a JOKE! DO not buy it! The opening is so tiny it clogs in less than 2 minutes. Then when you empty it the pieces take forever to fit together again -- and if you don't get it exactly right-- it falls apart and everything you just vacuumed will be all over the floor.Oh, and if you vacuum up anything wet-- it will be unable to suck anything else up until all the parts inside dry (and it's never the same again)"
2,Very Small Suction Hole - Sucks Up a Bit of Coffee Grounds-That's about it!,"The suction opening of this vac is really small. It took quite a bit of time to suck up some spilled wet coffee grounds off the floor and a lot of sweeping back and forth to pick up the grounds over a fairly small area because the hole is so small. It was very frustrating. It's only about the third time I've used the vac in the year that I have owned it. I had thought it would be handy to pick up some dry loose dust and dirt too, but it takes too much time, and you have to be sure to get the small opening right on top of the dust or dirt in order to suck it up. It is handy to have a portable wet/dry vac for wet spills, but I'd like one that could suck up more stuff at once so I could use it for more things."
3,"Okay, but not the bomb.","I read a lot of reviews and this had high marks. It works, but not in any awesome way. Is it good? Yes, and for the money I suppose it's great. But if you're like me and want Dyson quality suction in your vacuums, this isn't what you're looking for. It has a coffee make like filter that fills up fast, and the tip is an angled blunt hole the detracts from it's effectiveness. You'll find yourself using the tubular extension to get good suction, but then having a hard time picking up larger pieces."
3,works fine,only problem was trying to hang the unit verical. The hanger cut outs are opposite from what it should be
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this vac based on mainly positive reviews. However, after just a few uses, and always being on the charger when not in use, mine loses power noticably after less than one minute. For this reason, I cannot recommend this product."
5,Texas Love Story is the real deal,"This film is a must have for any REAL barbecue finatic! Will make any Texan homesick, and gives the rest of us a great snap shoot of what Authentic Barbecue is all about. It's more than just the food, it's a history, a culture, a frame of mind, as well as a form of cooking. Barbecue: Texas Love Story is a well made wimsecal tour of the bbq joints in Texas. It will leave you hungry for more!"
4,A Helpful Perspective,"The sociological research in part 1 about the impact of parents on the faith of their children is extremely helpful. At times the examples of conversations between parents and children came across to me as too contrived, but they still provided needed examples of opportunities to iniate family conversations about faith."
5,"Great DVD Set, Great Price",Picked this up as a Christmas gift for our daughter who loves Pocoyo. Awesome DVDs and an awesome price. Many many hours of Pocoyo on these DVDs. Great for long trips.
5,Wonderful Videos for Every Toddler to Enjoy,"I love the show. Our toddler loves the show. Only drawback is the inclusion of what appear to be endless and continuous commercials in the middle of the CD (almost a dozen or so) before further Pocoyo episodes are shown. You can skip them manually, but it is a major annoyance."
4,Love it!,The kids love Pocoyo and I find it very entertaining. It is simple animation and keeps it short perfect for toddlers attention span. The only thing I don't like of the DVD is that for each 7 minute long episode it plays the Pocoyo introduction. Wish they would of set it up so it goes straight into the episode. I do love that it comes in Spanish since we are raising our children bi-lingual.
1,Kinking hose,"This hose promised to be commercial grade and never have a problem with kinking. It is a nightmare. It kinks constantly, in numerous places. We are disappointed to have paid extra to have a product perform so poorly. If it weren't so difficult to mail back, we would not have kept this item. The only thing heavy-duty about this hose is the weight."
3,Silver Bells,"I've looked everywhere for a karaoke version of Silver Bells. While this one isn't perfect, it IS Silver Bells. There is a lot of background singing even on the karaoke version and even more on the one with Bing Crosby singing."
4,Heh heh heh. Hey Butthead! Check it out!,"There's not much more to say. Beevis and Butthead, the Cheech and Chong of the 90's. Although the comics can't do the TV show justice (no funny noises or anything) they still are pretty cool. If you're a B&B fan I suggest you pick these up."
5,Why I chose this product,This product is useful in weeding out noxious plants from around the farm. It has a long enough handle that you do not have to bend over to cut the weed at the base.
1,For some other garden,"I just cant seem to get the right leverage with this one. You cant dig into the ground, to get the roots.Maybe it would work in soft tilled earth with wimpy weeds, but I have found it useless in my adobe soil, on thistles, broom, and mustard."
3,Very Durable. Very uncomfortable.,"PROS: The most durable boots I own, and I mean durable. These will last forever.Not just waterproof, but very waterproof.You know when you wear these, nothing will get through.CONS: They are very expensive.They are very heavy.They are uncomfortable.They take forever to breakinThese are not tactical or quiet."
5,"Wow, wow, wow!!","Never heard Steve's first CD, but if it's anything like this latest, I'll be RUNNING, not walking, to buy it! Funky, jazzy, with a taste of sweet Latin rhythms and melodies, he's got it all! And the guy can PLAY!"
1,I'm amazed that anyone liked this book,"Similar to the first few reviewers of this book, I was gravely disappointed with Liner Notes, from beginning to end. This flat writing describes the ""relationships"" of the main character, who is annoying, self-centered, and shallow. Not only could I not relate to Laney, but I actually began to dislike the character more and more as I read. In addition to a less-than-appealing Laney, the story lacks any type of interesting or compelling storyline.If you're looking for a read that will leave a bad taste in your mouth, this is your book. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
1,"Warning: Two Bands, Same Name","This is a skate-rock album by a San Francisco band, and NOT the original Free Beer that did Country-Rock on RCA in the seventies. I am not passing judgment, just pointing out that this is not what I thought I ordered."
4,Unknown singer makes household name for himself,"Michael Bolotin was 23 when he recorded the tracks in Toronto, Canada for ""Every Day of My Life"". Produced by Jack Richardson, the album showcases the singer's immense lung power. There are some differences from his self-titled debut (1975) -- here are more disco rhythms to keep with the times, and the horn sections get a bit repetitive...but there are some winners with his beautiful ballad ""You Mean More to Me"" and, arguably the best Walsh cover around, his throaty rendition of ""Rocky Mountain Way"". All in all, this is a great effort by a virtually unknown singer who would, years later, rise to fame with a new sound and a slight change of name."
4,Prison Camp,"British diplomats are taken prisoner in 1917 and forced to walk to a Soviet Siberian prison camp. Initially they assume it's all a mistake and that their diplomat status will rescue them, but soon they realize they're on their own."
5,that voice!,"If you were sad when Wet Wet Wet broke up, put a smile back on your face because Marti is back. This album just gets better every time I play it. He has still got music in his voice. I can only hope that this will not be his only solo album and I don't have to wait too long before we get another album. He can adapt his voice to all types of music and that is the sheer brilliance of Mr Pellow's talent. Do yourself a favour and buy this album NOW!"
2,Great voice burt wrong music,"I adore Marti Pellow. When I saw him last in London, he was performing a concert and I felt like stealing all his posters back to Brazil with me.I bought this CD 2 weeks ago but stop listening to it 13 days ago. His voice is always impressive but his music is so irritating now. It's not a good idea for him to write all the songs because some of them are really out of tune and some are so boring and crude!I prefer the music of him with Wet Wet Wet. Can't he bring that magic back? Hope he could do better in the next album because I'm quite disappointed with this one(so pity it's his first one)."
2,Not my favorite Usborne book,I love all of the Usborne books so far but have some reservations about this one. That's not my Truck uses made-up words like ridgy in describing the trucks. Is that a word? Not my favorite Usborne.
3,Repeat Textures,"I like these books in general as a tool for kids to learn textures and start to enjoy reading, but this particular book repeats the ridge texture, which is annoying for such a short book."
5,My students love this book!,"I bought several books like this one and my students love this book. They can feel each texture in the book and learn to 'read' without the words. They all think the little mouse in the book is very cute. On each page they say, Oh he didn't fall out yet and on the last page he falls out of the tipper truck. My students are up to three and a half and they each love all the books like this one."
5,A great one in the series,"I had no idea what to expect with this title, though I have a few other books in the ""It's Not My..."" series. Each page has a great, large, section of texture for my kids to touch - from squishy to bumpy to scratchy. This is a good buy."
4,Excellent...,"This is my first time to buy jewelery online, and it turns out pretty well, will shop again..."
1,As exciting as watching corn grow,"The header pretty much explains it all. If you don't want to take the time to travel to a small town cafe to listen to farmers tell stories about how ""it used to be,"" watch this movie. Unless you're direct kin of the family, I can't imagine anyone else in the world being interested."
4,"An even handed, jaunty, intelligent work","If you're looking for a reasonable, unbiased look at the impact of Wilsonian sociobiology on ethics, check out this book. Too many philosophers, I think, are too quick to write off Wilson, et al; their work lacks philosophical rigor, admittedly, and professional philosophers simply won't tolerate that. Murphy rises above this bias (which, perhaps, is based largely on lingo anyway) to examine Wilson fairly. I recommend this book."
5,I loved this film.,This film was one of the most imaginative films I've seen recently. The animation and cinematography were beautiful. Thought provoking themes and powerful acting.
5,A Blast from the Past!,"Good storytelling through historical events of the not so distance past. Taken from our National Archives, each episode gives a compelling and interesting story that you may have never heard before. At the end is a tie in to the bible & paints the paralels in our lives today. I like all four but my favorite was the tornado-proof house. If you like Nostalgia, you will love this series. It's got something for all ages."
3,Not as good as it's for-runner,"The audio cassette, like the book it is derived from, is very interesting. It picks up William's story from precisely the point at which you leave it in ""The Road to Nab End"".The early part of the story I found interesting, it certainly demonstrates that poverty in the early 20th century England was a nation wide issue, amongst the working classes; you could mistakenly believe it just effected the north had you only read the first book. William's journey through education and on to Oxford University, delighted me. But the book is politics heavy and if the history of the Labour movement is not your cup of tea, then you might find you lose your way a touch with this book. Keep on though, it is worth it, it just lacks the evocative magic of it's for runner for the most part. It does cleverly highlight pre-WW2 politics. Some of the early stories capture the old magic, particualry William's cyclehunt for his lost love in driving snow!"
5,This is not a childrens book,"It is to my great sorrow to see this excellent book listed under the Childrens Section. I read it cover to cover slowly and carefully. It covered the selected writers in depth, so that one was not left wanting for more. The photographs filled in the gaps. Each one is an expressive portrait. I do hope that high school students will include this in their reading, but I also think this is an important book for adults who want to fill in their knowledge on the holocaust."
2,Where was the romance?,"The characters were - blah! I didn't understand him at all. He was just mean. Didn't explain why until late in the book. She was vapid. She spends one night with him, knows nothing about him,exchanges a handleful of conversations with him(in which he is mean to her) and FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM! Please, I know the hero's are supposed to be mean, rakish and not care about anyone's feelings, but he wasn't even present half of the book. It was all about her and how she loved him. So how could this be a romance? They were never together. It was disappointing after all the good reviews."
5,Cold night warm stranger,I love the way in which i received the book. It was on time and i would gladly buy other books from the seller again.
1,Am I reading the same book?,"Obviously reviewers haven't read steamy, heartfelt romance novels b/c this was not one of them.This book is blah at best. I'm 3/4 of the way finished with it and I'm struggling. It's not a good sign when you leave the book on your nightstand for more than a few nights without any desire to pick it up and see what happens.Nothing about this book held my interest. Not the plot, not the characters, not the writing....zilch."
1,Quick Disconnect is Proprietary!,"If you have a Cisco 7921 or 7920, you *only* need this if you want to use a Plantronics headset with ""Quick Disconnect"" otherwise you can use any (cough) ""standard"" Nokia headset, per the Cisco documents:Q. What types of headsets are supported on the Cisco Unified Wireless IP Phone 7921G?A. This phone has a 2.5-mm (four-conductor tri-band) connector that can accommodate a Nokia-compatible headset. Please refer to [...] for a list of headsets that are supported"
4,Fantastic Guide To Hiking in Hong Kong,This is an indispensable guide to trails in and around Hong Kong island. Stokes exposes the reader to aspects of Hong Kong that are overlooked by most tourist. The reader soon realizes that there is a treasure of wild places on this relatively small island. I was inspired to explore all the trails he suggested.
5,Desserts for Angels and Gods,"If you love, not like desserts, then this is the book for you. I just got the book and have made the Clemintine Cake. This dessert is truly for Gods and Angels. The cake was a real show stopper.The recipe was easy and the results were divine. I would encourage anyone that loves desserts to buy this book.Enjoy and savor each recipe.John Ellis"
3,B-29 Pilot's Flight Operations Manual,"This manual would be especially attractive to a pilot, retired or active. As a retired pilot I expected to find just what the name of the manual inferred, Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions.Although I found the manual to be interesting, it sorely lacked information originally contained in these manuals, such a airplane flight characteristics, take off and landing procedures,and performance information, i.e., airplane and engine limitations, take off and landing distances, including climb, cruise and range data.Had I have known of these deficient areas of information prior to ordering the manual, I would have by-passed the opportunity to purchase it."
4,B-29 Bomber Pilot's Flight Operating Manual,"The manual is very informative and I'm very glad to have it as a research tool. I was disappointed, however, that the flight performance data (speeds, rate of climb, etc.) were not included in the manual, but were rather referenced to a subsequent publication.It would be nice to include this as an insert or supplement for future purchasers. I will probably never fly a B-29, but would like to know landing speed (flaps up, flaps down), stall speeds, best rate of climb speed, and weight and balance data as well as other technical performance data. I have tried searching the web and have not found any such data that is complete enough for reference."
3,Fast shipping. Great product concept but...,"I rarely use needle ""protectors"" like these, but thought i'd try them. They're good in concept, but they are easily lost unless you are very disciplined about putting them someplace safe when you take them off the needles (which I'm not). I think i'll stick to using rubber bands around my needle points when i have ""stuffed needles"". Otherwise, I have no complaints - the product is top quality, as always with Clover products - it just doesn't suit my style."
3,Decent Country-Rock Debut,"Florence Dore's ""Perfect City"" is the kind of debut album that leaves you somewhat hungry, but salivating in anticipation of what the artist might do next. At her best she is very good, as she particularly shows on the haunting ""Christmas,"" a song unlikely to be featured on any holiday specials any time soon. Dore has a decent voice and is backed by a capable twangy rock band. Other standouts on the album include ""Early World"" and ""No Nashville."" On the downside, the production is murky at times and the CD booklet contains only a few scant pages of information. Given the occasional lack of vocal clarity, a lyrics sheet would have been a big help.Overall, an intriguing debut by an artist who seems capable of bigger and better things."
5,Hidden Treasure,"I became aware of this artist while listening to a public radio station out of New York. I liked the title track and read positive reviews so I bought the CD. What a pleasant discovery. I smile every time I put on this CD. I can't find one disappointing song on the album. It's good from start to finish. The last time I happened upon an artist I knew so little about and liked so much was when I bought ""In My Tribe"" by 10,000 Maniacs. I hope more people find out about this talented woman."
2,\m/,"This band is awful. If they are going to make a record, they should learn enlgish and take music lessons first. But all in all, it's pretty funny."
2,Dull,"This was a very dull movie about five kids who have to deal with various issues, like divorce, the death of a parent, and parents being constantly absent. They go around saying deep psychological things that kids would never say, and the story takes place in their suburban neighborhood and in the fields around the house, so visually, it's nothing exciting.There IS some drama in the movie when you get these black-and-white clips of a guy with a sword and a cape running through fields and forest, and this is always followed by an attack on the five kids by a ""Dark Spirit,"" which causes one of the girls to have an asthma attack, and some of the kids have to fight it off with shining yellow swords. That is the extent of drama in the film, and it is very good, but there is only a little of it. Otherwise, the acting is not too good, and the movie is very bad. I was hoping there would be more fantasy in it, which is what the cover of the DVD made it look like there would be."
1,Too much 'personal development' not enough information,I was disappointed to find that much of the book is dedicated to building artistic confidence (huh). Who buys a how-to book to give them tools to 'soothe their inner critic'? I was hoping for more information on different techniques and patterns.
1,"""Queen of Trash""","I am an artist with first & second level awards nationwide, so when I purchased this ""creative"" book, I expected ""treasures"" of information. Instead, all I saw was ""trash"", I'm sorry to say.I found no beauty in any of the illustrated, uh..... embellishments? NOT!Every color illustration looked like a messy menagerie of beads, all clumped together. I had to squint, turn the page sideways or upside-down to make out any sense of form or design.....of which I found none.I do not recommend this book for anyone and if I could, I would give it a rating of NO stars."
3,Good but a little outdated,I listened to this book a little too much. It was slightly outdated and overly conservative. I have found better sources for Chinese cultural information and business.
1,Very limited range. Unsafe.,"I will ignore that fact that this product looks like it was designed and built in 1980. The interface to program the device is very difficult, much like programming your 1980's VCR. I could live with those issues. The real problem is the range. Don't have a medical emergency more than 15 feet from the base unit, because chances are it won't work. I am not exaggerating a bit here. This was tested in a house with 15-20 feet line of site from the base station, nothing but air in between. If you add an obstruction like a wall, the working distance is less.I would not recommend this to anybody.If you do buy this, and I can't stress this enough, test it thoroughly in the home were it is installed. For a product that is intended to be used in an emergency I can only describe this as an extremely dangerous product."
5,Party Music,If you love to dance the night away or rock and roll or just want to shake your groove thang and you love to P-A-R-T-Y! Then this album is for you.
4,Happy with dance,This is a good Cd if you are a teacher and need a good CD for gym or want to teach some simple dances to your kids. The music is done well and it's fun.
2,Hmm.,"These songs are definately for younger kids,but not even six year olds,younger. I do like ""Achy Breaky Heart""Okay and I like""Hands Up"" Alot,but most of it is for young kids. Good-bye."
1,Who is this singing anyway?,"This CD was a big disappointment. I was hoping for the REAL renditions for my child's birthday party, and BOY, while these are the real words, and sung in tune by adults, they are not the songs I remember listening to. (At least they are sung in tune, although there is not a drop of passion in it.)Perhaps I can get my money's worth out by hanging it outside to scare the crows away."
1,disappointment,perlman at his best! great sound! but the picture is of a very poor quality!!! like an old used videosorry
5,Company stands behind their products,"We own what I believe to be the same shovel, which was previously marketed under the ""Lady Gardener"" brand by Union Tools.My wife and I used it for several years and found the small blade size very handy, especially for planting flower bulbs and for digging in tight spots.This fall the blade tore apart. The label on our shovel said it had a lifetime warranty, so I called Union Tools. After verifying our shovel, the customer service rep offered to send a new shovel without hesitation.We got a lot of use out of our first shovel and we're very pleased to find a company that stands behind its products. Union Tools will be at the top of our list the next time we need gardening equipment."
5,Love this shovel,"My mother gardens, and had been looking for an easier-to-handle version of the clunky hardware store shovels for years.We've only had this one for a few weeks, but so far, she's loved the shape and weight of this shovel for her usual needs: burying compost and planting flowers/small trees/vegetables.Haven't put it on a scale to check, but it definitely feels like it weighs merely 2.5 lb.Love it, thank you, Union!"
2,Weak,"This brews a very weak tea. I prefer Tazo or Bigelow brands. I bought this tea on Amazon, but will not buy it again."
2,Half with licorice flavoring ruins it for me,"I hate licorice flavor. Half the teas in this pack include licorice powder in them, which ruins it for me. Why would you add it to the otherwise lovely, fruity flavors of blueberry, mango or raspberry tea? I'm surprised others find these teas to be weak. As one reviewer pointed out, maybe they were diluting it with too much water. I love ginger in cooking, and I even like eating pieces of it in dried form. But in a tea, you expect a hint of it's flavor, not the full strength of the spice. The ginger tea was just too overpowering to the point of being unpleasant. Although I like the other teas in this box without licorice flavoring, I would not bother buying this sampler box again to get them."
5,Lots of tea!,We'll be drinking herbal tea for a long time with 108 bags. Lots of variety for all! Thanks for this wonderful option!
5,An adventure of the body and the spirit,"A young man, Sam, follows the call to adventure given him by a Delaware Indian sitting by a mighty river. During his journey Sam learns love, fighting, the ways of Indians and the songs of mountains and rivers. But more than this, Sam learns his own heart, his strengths, his hopes and his fears. SO WILD A DREAM is a real page-turner packed with adventure. It's also a beautiful and poetic story of a spiritual adventure learned through trials and triumphs. Win Blevins once again creates a rich world with all the juicy stuff of living. A must read."
4,another good book in a series,Part of a series of 5 books about the western expansion. I enjoyed the whole series. I think they ae a little better if read in order.
1,So Wild A Dream,I thought the mixture of the mixture of well known characters with the fictional characters was outstanding. The story moved along repidly and the excitement was outstanding. Looking forward to the rest of the seris.
3,A Seasoned Mellow Pop Singer-songwriter,"David Pomeranz has been around for a long time, writing songs for pop icons like Barry Manilow, Bette Midler, Kenny Rogers... since the 70's, a very impress resume indeed. Apparently, he is more popular in the Phillipines and in Europe as record companies there have released his albums primarily. Also, the first song ""On This Day"" on this album would be a fantastic song for wedding, I don't understand why it is not sung or used more frequently in weddings here in the United States.If you like mellow pop, this album will not be disappointing: solid writing, good accompaniment, memorable melodies..."
1,Don't Buy from This Company,"It was bad enough that they pawned off ""something"" as a camera - I can understand - everyone makes mistakes. But - when they DID NOT have any way to contact them other than e-mail, I question their integrity. Of course, they never replied to any of my e-mails about the situation."
1,I took one picture and the lens broke.,"I really can't review much about this camera because I didn't really have a chance to use it before it broke. The lens wouldn't retract and I get the message ""zoom error."" ...Packed it up and sent it back. Still waiting for my refund. Will not be buying this camera again."
1,Good Camera for 1st users (Tweens),The camera is easy to use. I received this camera for my birthday from my girlfriend. I love taking pictures. The bad thing is there is no sound with the mini movies. The batteries don't last long no matter what kind of batteries you buy. I've taken very good care of this camera & have never dropped it or left it in the heat or cold weather. This camera quit working after only owning it for 2 years. Don't buy it for the amount of money you spend on it.
4,Good camera,"At 4.0 megapixels and with a bit of a delay in snapping a picture, this is hardly the best camera on the market, but it takes a decent picture, and at the less than forty dollars I paid for it, it was a fantastic deal."
3,MCAT physics,useful to give a view of the topics and testing your knowledge. wide variety of questions given in the book
2,"Past the scope of the book, no passages","Again, this book was no exception towards my dislike for the EK 1001 series.What I didn't like:1) Goes past the scope of the book. I felt as if the questions could've been more representative of what I was reading.2) The biggie.. this entire book is full of nothing but discretes. No passages. Zero.If you want to study _any_ section on the MCAT sufficiently, you have to do practice passages. This delivers none."
4,Hits the Basics and manipulation of the Physics Formulas,"This is a good book to help you memorize and manipulate/show the relations between the concepts of almost all the physic formulas involved in the Mcat. I highly recommend it if you need to polish up on some. It helped me memorize formulas. The only downside was that it did not have deep emphasis on the pendulum concept. I know that appears on the mcat. This book consists of very brief questions of each concept but no passages. It's very basic. If your looking for challenging questions involving passages, you probably won't like this book.I still recommend this book."
2,At first it seemed promising.,"At first I thought that this book was good. It seems like a good idea to practice 1001 questions. However, the questions are confusing and not reflective of real MCAT questions. I've had my physics instructor, who used to teach MCAT prep courses, look at the book and he also thought that many questions were not worded well. They say that they are trying to make it more challenging so that you will know what to expect on the MCAT. I don't like that approach and wish I hadn't spent my money on this. BTW I'm getting 10's and 11's, usually only missing two or three physics questions, on my practice sections, so I don't feel like it's because I don't understand physics."
4,"Hard ones, Easy ones.","The style of the questions get you thinking conceptually. For each topic the difficulty ranges from easy to extremely difficult. The difficult ones can be intimidating if you don't realize that they won't likely be that hard on the real thing. The explanations are concise, and often reveal when an overly difficult question is out of the MCAT league."
3,Omni-Directional Antenna,"I ordered this product to get a quicker speed and better internet service for my computer, all it did was got from very low to low... I'm not impressed with this product...It does okay with the internet, not as good as I expected it would."
3,Concise Collection of Familiar Ideas,"There's nothing really new or insightful in this book for anyone who has had some training in Christian relational and marital dynamics. Wright here offers a good definition of Christian marriage, pointers on communication, and a lengthy explanation of personality types. He concludes his work by providing some advice on anger and how to resolve conflict. This book isn't bad, but I've read far better and much more stimulating titles."
4,"Interesting,clever,educational,easy to follow","Red Cloud:Warrioir Statesman of the Lakota Souix is a really excellent biography. Larson does a great job of presenting all the informaton in an understandable and captivating way that really makes me want to learn more about Native American history. There is even a map/picture section in the middle of the biography that helps clarify any questions you may have while reading, as all the different battles and tribes might confuse you. Other than that temporary confusion, good job Mr. Larson"
3,A exciting adventure,"The book the Red Cloud is a really good book about the native american period. It talks about the history of one leader, Red Cloud. It talks about his life and his effect on the land and his people. He was a strong and couragous person. He stood up for what he believed in. He was kinda of like the the person in between, that is the person between the government and the tribes. Red Cloud did not favored the separation of people. He believed that we can coexist together. Red Cloud lived a long time for someone back then. This is a good book for educational purposes. It is a great tool for learning about the history of Native Americans. Even though this is an biography, it can still be a great learning experience for all."
3,Won't work as FAT switch,"I bought this hoping it would function as an LED footswitch for the FAT boost on my Fender Blues Junior III. No dice. I know, I know - it's advertised as a channel switch, but I assumed it would toggle FAT on and off too. It does work fine on my old practice Fender Champion 30 as an LED channel switch between clean and gain, and it's built very sturdy (newest version doesn't look like the picture above anymore) so at least I can use it with that amp. I know I can get the Fender one-button footswitch designed to activate FAT on the Blues Junior, but I really want one with a light and it doesn't appear that Fender makes one. The Marshall Footswitch One-Button with LED works on the Mustang I but not on the Blues Junior III. Read my review on the Boss latched unit - that one does the job for BJ3."
2,The doctors first two books were GREAT ! This one is well..,I devoured DR. Weil's first book. It was full of usefull information. The second book was interesting. This book is just like all the other optium health books on the market. I am dissapointed. However there were some good recipies and ideas to ponder
5,Practical and Informative,"Dr. Weil's methodology of introducing concepts a week at a time, along with specific tasks and lifestyle changes, breaks his program into reasonable pieces. I don't believe in diets or diet books, and I've read plenty about stress, so I wasn't prepared to like this book. It's not too New Age-y, or over the top. Dr. Weil trained as an allopathic (traditional) physician, and weaves in alternative and mainstream advice. It seems balanced, and it changed my life."
4,a great book for healthy living,"Dr.Weil's book takes into account the whole person-constituted of physical,spiritual and psychologicalelements - when it deals with the healthy living.I myself have put into practice some of his insightsand I found that it really works... This book isa great contribution to holistic health.The book is interesting , useful, and very practical."
5,It has put me back on track again !!! Thank you.,"I saw Dr. Weil for the first time on 20/20 a few weeks back and it started me thinking. Then a week later he was on PBS in the San Francisco Bay area doing a fund raising. Boy, was, it powerful. I quickly ordered the book and was able to get it at discount. I started Dr. Weil's program and am on the end of the second week. So far, I feel better, with more energy and optimistic about whats to come. Thank you"
4,Great Start... but Be Careful!,"I listened to this book several times and started doing most of his recommendations. It is a great kick start to getting healthy.Although... he suggested purchasing several ""tonics"" or herbs from a health food store and start taking them to boost your immune system. I purchased astragalus and took 1 pill and spent the entire night throwing up. Apparently I was allergic... who knew?My favorite recommendations that I have stuck to are to get rid of all products containing ""Hydrogenated oils"" of any kind. (All cookies, crackers, most chips and 90% of boxed food.) Eating more meals with soy. I actually went Vegetarian after seeing the DVD ""Eating"" shortly after starting his program. Bringing more plants and flowers into the house. Walking and a few breathing exercises.Final synopsis: Its a great start to getting healthy but don't follow all his recommendations to a ""T"". Choose what you feel comfortable with."
2,A strange author,"I believe in the power of the mind in healing. That said, I fear people who are in real trouble and riddled with fear will read this book and not seek medical care. A healthy lifestyle and a positive attitude will have a very strong influence on your health and the outcome or course of any disease process. That said, until we are able to unlock the secrets of the brain that control self-healing, your doctor is your best bet. Hiding your head in the sand and shopping health food stores for ""magic"" potions is very dangerous. Not only can you miss an opportuinity for early intervention in a disease process, but you may poison yourself with ""herbs"", etc. from health food stores that are lethal in combination or inappropriate doses. In a few words----""Proceed With Caution"" and don't believe everything you read---an M.D. behind someone's name does not guarantee good or accurate advice."
1,Why the rehash of the obvious?,"I have been consultant for the translation of dr. Weil`s excellent five-star book ""Spontaneous healing"", and for this cash-in-on-a-success follow-up volume. All information in this book has been stated in a better, more precise way in its predecessor.The only news in this book is that is not unhealthy to take walks, be good to yourself, follow a healthy diet, get enough sleep, think postively. The most revolutionary piece of advice is, on the other hand, a real breakthrough: Buy yourself flowers once in a while. This will guarantee optimum health in 8 weeks, at least to anyone who buys the book. Come on, dr. Weil, how stupid do you think we are?"
1,Save your money.,"The information is neither new, comprehensive or factually relevant. Buy Pizzorno and Marray's 'Enclopedia of Natural Medicine' instead."
2,Disapointing,"After intriguing first volume, the second volume of Gravitation was a big disappointment. Sweet and puppy-like Shuichi continues to pursue cool and distant Yuki, but the older man completely takes advantage of the boy. After claiming time after time that he isn't interested in men Yuki blatantly rapes the Shuichi even though the boy pleads with him that he's afraid and hurting. Afterwards Yuki is his cold self and brushes off the whole incident. I know rape is a common theme in BL, but this was just disgusting. There was no consequence either for the rapist or the victim, and the whole incident was promptly forgotten. It's also worth noting that it's true the manga is more explicit than the anime, but there are no ""naughty bits"" here if that's what you're scared of (or looking for).In addition, I really don't like Murakami's style in her older work - it's smudgy and uneven, and I have difficulties in differentiating between different characters."
5,what's not to like?,"J-rock stars, bishounen's, humor...what's not to like? This is an awsome story of Shindou-san's first love...that is, next to music ^_^"
1,collecting dust,I bought this book a while back for help understanding my teens and tweens. It seemed more like results of a clinical study than leisurely reading.
3,wiggles too much,The bench looks great. I'm 250 pounds however and will not sit on it. It already wiggles a bit for my 130 pound wife. Just not as stable as I would have hoped. It is easily adjustible and shows no sign of breaking. But the wobble is worrying. We'll see how long it lasts.
3,great for the price,Looks great. Needs a little more padding if you plan to play for any length of time.
5,K Drama,"Great Korean drama. This final volume is a must see.The special features at the end are great. I enjoyed the ending theme song as the final credits rolled. Also, the interview with cast and director was very good."
4,Good thing I persisted,"After reading the first dozen pages, I was rather disappointed. I kept telling myself, ""Oh, well, at least I bought it used,"" but even so I was tempted to bawl out the reviewer from ""Analog"", I think, who'd gushed about the book. And then it clicked. And after that I was almost wholly happy. The gags, the one-liners, the action scenes - they all work nicely, even if the mushroom men make strangely low-powered enemies (I mean, falling apart because of shotgun recoil? Hardly brilliant...).All in all, a nice fast read with a good premise and decent writing. Hopefully, if there are sequels, they would improve on this."
2,Hem came undone,"I love the look of this apron and the fact that the tie is one long piece of fabric so it's super-adjustable--I'm short and the neck strap on aprons are always too long, so I appreciate being able to adjust it on this one. Unfortunately I've only worn it once, as the hem on the frills on the bottom came undone the first time I washed it. Once I get some help with sewing it I'm sure it will be fine, but I was still disappointed that the quality was so poor."
3,"Nice reference book, but not good enough to use in class",This book is supposed to be the textbook for a class like 'Detection and Estimation'. To serve this purpose it is too lengthy and incomplete. Practice shows it is impossible to cover the whole book within one semester. It is not much easier to attract people to take the continuation of the course another semester once they know the same book will be used.Statistics is supposed to be a fairly mathematical discipline. You may hide it on a lecture but students immediately realize it when they start doing a homework. For a mathematical text this book lacks a lot of details. Thngs often fall out of nowhere and it is very hard for students to follow how equations are derived.If you want to use this book in class prepare to do a lot of additional explanation in class or reserve a couple of days for the office hours.
3,"Interesting, well organized, but...","The book is well-organized in terms of content and layout, but the mathematics is very poorly presented. Some things just fall out of mid-air. It could use some rigorous presentation.Examples and applications are mostly from communications and Radar processing, a wider base applied to maybe medical diagnosis, speech processing may be helpful."
4,An extremely good choice for the money.,These are very good knives for every day use at an excellent price.
5,none,"so, with no title and no track listing who the hell is gonna buy this thing...i know i'll love it, i love all mfatgg's stuff, but I'm not gonna shell over a bunch of loot so i can maybe get something i'd like. Couldn't get some info on this if they're gonna sell it?"
1,not recommended,"I purchased this bike the last September to commute to school and the break pads wore down in a few months. Both front and rear breaks do not work now. In addition to non stoping performance, the right pedal came off. So I went to the bike shop, hoping to get repaired. However, the guy at the bike shop told me that I was the 3rd customer with the same problem. The replacement for the bike pedal attachment part has to be imported from China and there is nowhere that makes the same part in America. Now the right pedal is useless and nonfixable in America, I cannot use the bike and I have no choice but to throw away. ""Kawasaki"" is just a sticker that was put on the body.Please do not waste your money on this cheaper bike. I would recommend that anyone should invest in a nicer bike.Kawasaki KX26 Women's 26-Inch Mountain Bike"
1,Don't buy it.,"I got this bike for my wife and this turned out to be the worst item I've purchased online.(period) The break system was already broken out of the box, seems like it was any way a below par product anyway. the rest of the bike if definitely not good and you'll be disappointed with it. and its not safe since every part seems to be prone to breakage ...."
3,there's a huge difference between the Heaven songs,"i can totally tell the difference between eyra gail and dj sammy & yanou feat.do's heaven.do is a better singer and eyra gail can sing, but mushes up the words a bit when she sings. i don't know why both heaven versions came out at the same time and have the same exact tune sounds in the backround. they're both good songs but dj sammy's verison is still better."
4,Great variety,Usually when you purchase CD singles the various mixes can sometimes be very similar to the last. Not with this CD single. Each mix has its own style and sound unlike the previous mix before. There are a total of 8 mixes on this CD single making it a great value. If you like diversity in remixes...this is it! Erya Gail has what it takes to make it as a dancefloor diva! Keep your eye on this gal.
4,"If you've read their books, skip this DVD","I read The Monks of New Skete, The Art of Raising a Puppy and let me say I think that book was amazing, thorough, was the best of the half dozen puppy books I've read. But about this video, I feel this video doesn't add any additional training info that wasn't already in the book. There are 2 DVDs, the first one is essentially about the Monk's philosophical approach to raising dogs. The second DVD continues this philosophy and then finally, finally in the very last section there is some actual training demonstrations that lasts about 20 minutes. But is is the SAME training material that is covered in the book as well.I gave the video 4 stars because if you haven't read The Monks of New Skete, The Art of Raising a Puppy book, getting this DVD is a good idea. If you've read the book, my advice is to skip this DVD."
5,A great program for training your dog,"I initially read the book, and finally purchased the DVD to train our JRT. Yes, the monks share a lot of teaching philosophy; they encourage you to be a benevolent leader, among other things. But, these guys are professionals. What should you expect? The training DVD is easy to follow. You'll be able to make your dog heel in 5 minutes! No, I'm only joking; it's not that easy....but, honestly, I've worked with a trainer before purchasing this DVD. The basic philosophy presented in this DVD is pretty much the same method used by the trainer. If you're really serious about wanting to have a well-mannered animal companion, then you might want to give this one a try. But it will require effort, patience, and love on your part."
1,Weak on training info,"This dvd was a huge let down. It also took several weeks to get it from the Monks web site. If you know a little about training a dog, then do not get this video. It is made for the person who knows nothing about dogs at all. However, if you are having problems sleeping at night, I highly recommend this video. Everytime I put it in my DVD player, I am bored me to sleep.Raising Your Dog with the Monks of New Skete"
1,Does not charge Cannon SD200,"This charger is being advertised for the Cannon SD200, and does not work. The slot is for a much larger battery. I would have returned, but the cost would've been twice what I payed for it initially."
3,Inexpensive Charger,This is an inexpensive replacement for a battery charger. This charger has a car adapter so I can charge on the road
4,2nd replacement battery charger,"Charger works as well as I expected. However, the one pictured is not the one that I received."
4,Hardcore Dance Music,"With the exception of the first four house tracks,this cd is just great.The main reason is because I cant stand most house,and I would like it if he had made the entire album trancey.The progressiveness and heart pounding beats make this cd a favorite of mine.This is a killer mix from San Francisco's best house/trance dj.What I wanna know is where is this guy now?...I want more...Enough said,If you like dance you want this album"
5,Great if short collection,"Don't be fooled by the title. There's some top notch artists in this elevator:Track listing1. Harlem Nocturne - Esquivel2. Moon Is Blue, The - Sauter-Finnegan3. Moonlight In Vermont - Hugh Winterhalter4. Night Train - Buddy Morrow5. Stars Fell On Alabama - The Three Suns6. Teach Me Tonight - Ann-Margret7. Blue Moon - Melachrino Strings8. Some Enchanted Evening - Ralph Flanagan9. That Old Black Magic - Marty Gold & Orchestra (CD only)10. Three O'Clock In The Morning - Hugo & Luigi Chorus (CD only)"
2,Almost impossible to assemble,"This bench looks good and is comfortable, however the legs wereextremely difficult to attach to the bench itself.I had to remove the rubber pads at the top of each leg and even then they wouldn't fit.With a lot of wrestling, banging, and finessing I eventually forced them into positionbut it took ages and my hands and arms ached the whole next day."
3,"Pretty, but....",These beads are pretty but they are strung a little tight so they don't lay as evenly as I would like.
2,Not what I expected,"I must be EXTREMELY out of shape. I could barely keep up with the instructor during the warm up, let alone the actual workout. I thought since it was for ""dummies"" that it would start out a little slower. The warm up in my opinion was almost a full blown workout."
3,not pleased,"This CD is more confusing than anything. I was not able to burn fat.I bought a CD with Jillian Michaels ""Kickbox fastfix"" and that really works. In less than a month I look like those girls in the CD."
1,Too easy!,"I bought this because of FITNESS magazine's recommendation: The magazine claims that it would burn 700 calories for the workout. Not so. I probably burned 50. I was looking for a DVD that gave me a little more cardio, and thought this might do the trick. I didnt even break a sweat!I am extremely dissapointed in how easy the DVD is. There is nothing exciting or challenging about it!If you are a TRUE beginner, this may be for you, but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone with even a moderate amount of physical activity. How can FITNESS Magazine call this one of the Top 10 DVD's out there?"
1,Much too fast,These may be basic moves but the pace is much too fast. I had chest pains after doing this workout. I would only recommend it to someone who is at an advanced fitness level and does high-impact cardio on a regular basis.
2,Only for Beginners,It's a nice DVD for beginners .. definitely teaches you the basics well. But I have been to several Kickboxing classes at my gym ... and so this wasn't intense for me at all. I hardly broke a sweat.
2,"Yes, For ""Dummies""","The DVD is what is markets itself to be, a Kick-boxing workout for Dummies.It is very basic and moves slowly. When it is done, you are left asking, ""Is that it?""This is NOT a dvd for serious Kickboxing lovers. This is a good START though.One thing I didn't like was that the workout is void of excitement. There are no people in the background to amp up the energy and the woman leading tries to be exciting, but she is drole and plain.If my review is too harsh, I have to say in all fairness, it is ""Fat-burning Kickboxing Workout for 'Dummies.'"" Perhaps I didn't really know what that meant.I did feel a little burn in the morning so perhaps the ""fat-burning"" part is the real gold."
1,Waste of Money,"I am very disappointed w/this DVD. I just tried it this morning and it was way too slow. I think she spent more time explaining every detail of each movement, than doing it."
3,Fun workout,"I'd say this was a fun workout. It's a good change if you want to mix up your workouts a bit, but I didn't find it as tiring as a typical workout for some reason, and I'm a kickboxing novice. I certainly don't think I burned 700 calories, as one of the reviewers suggested they were burning. As a beginner I found the rapid moves a little challenging and required concentration, but it's easy to catch on if you stick with it."
4,To clear up any misconceptions...,"...this IS, in fact, a video for beginners. In case anyone was wondering.That said, although I AM a beginning kickboxer, I am not mentally or physically deficient, so I found the mind-numbing repetition of this video to be somewhat off-putting. However, it is an excellent resource for those attempting to teach themselves kickboxing. While I wouldn't make it my daily (or weekly, or even monthly) workout, I will go to the Top Ten segment to refresh my back kick ever so often. I say this with a note of caution: even beginners get bored.However, I love Keli Roberts, and her personality and style (not to mention the fact that she's actually DOING the workouts) make me smile every time I watch one of her videos. I would definitely suggest this to anyone looking for a reference for kickboxing form."
2,eh,"Eh, it's okay. It is very slow for my taste but does explain the moves in detail so for a beginner it would be okay."
1,so disappointed,"This video was so highly rated, but I was really let down. Really let down. I wish I could send it back."
1,"No Challenge, Boring, Terrible workout!","Total waste of money. MIght be good for a very beginning exerciser. Other than that, it was terrible. So easy, that I didn't even breathe heavily even when adding power moves to her routine. Way too easy. I didn't even feel like I worked out. I just wasted 30 minutes and had to do another workout. Not recommended for intermediate or advanced exercisers."
3,It was ok.,"This dvd was ok. I thought it was harder than any other kickboxing dvd I have used,mainly because it was annoying with all the notes and instructions on the side. That's just me though,somebody else may like it just fine."
3,Kick my arse,"Just got it and will stick with it, but the combinations can be difficult to follow. I am coordinated, but seem like I have extra feet while doing this. Hopefully it will help me to lose this post-pregnancy weight."
4,Great Starter to Kickboxing,"This is a great DVD for beginners that haven't become ""couch potatos"". It has plenty of variety for the newbie. Eight years ago I was able to keep up with Billy Blanks, but at 58 and having slacked off a bit, this was enough to get me going again without ""scaring me off"". I do workout to all 3 Fat Burning sessions at one time on the days I don't do resistance or weight training. It's great for adding variety to your walking or step aerobic training. If you're very active you may need to bump it up a notch."
1,Fat-Burning Kickboxing Workout for Dummies IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS,Before purchasing this product I looked at the reviews on this item and the reviews stated it was a good dvd for beginners. For the last 6 months I had been wanting to purchase a kickboxing workout for beginners and I was excited to find one. After receiving this DVD I tried the workout for several weeks and found out this DVD is very fast paced and the instruction and cueing of move changes is poorly done by Keli Roberts. The only thing I found good about this DVD is that I only paid $8.00 for it. I was very disappointed in this product.
4,"Great instructional video for technique and form. Not a cardio workout, unless you a new to exercise.","The video is broken up into a short warm up, three 10 minute active sections and cool down. The total time is a little over 40 minutes, easy to fit into the day."
2,"Um,so maybe she needs dummies for dummies","I am not the most coordinated person in the world so I thought this would be a good buy for me. However, the way it's put together...you have to be on your game. I am pretty sure after a week I am still not doing the movements correctly. Mostly I just sweat to keep up with how fast she changes from one thing to the next."
5,LOVE THIS,I love this video. They say it burns about 600 calories. 900 if you really put all of your effort into it and do the tutorial video. It works out my whole body and it great to alternate with yoga. It keeps you going. I try to do it about twice a month. She says to do it 3 times a week but this is a killer workout and so upbeat!
3,Photos don't do work justice,I found the photos to take away from the words. Also parts of the poem were placed in bold face and made them stand out in the wrong way; it simplified Ehrmann's ideas too much. I was very disappointed in how it changed the over all feel. I would think these words are better left alone without other artists visual interpretation attached. Just my thoughts.
2,"Tries, fails.","Max Ehrmann and Marc Tauss, Desiderata: Words for Life (Scholastic, 2009)Photographer Tauss takes poet Ehrmann's painfully waterlogged chestnut, which I have to admit I'd never read all the way through, and pairs pieces of it with different photographs. There are times when Tauss is dead-on here, and I have to admit that when I saw the first photograph (an early-morning street scene; no moving cars, but parking spaces at the sides of the road are choked with parked, empty cars) I had high hopes for this one. They were quickly readjusted, though, as the next few pictures were the expected smarmy crap that goes with Ehrmann's saccharine, unsubtle words. While there were a couple more pleasant surprises to be had here, the quality isn't consistent enough to recommend the book unless you're already a huge fan of the poem. **"
3,so so,would have like the photos to be more colorful. But the words are meaningful. Good pick me up when the day is stressful.
4,My way of living,This poem has been my life plan. The Kindle format is by verse and the flow is not as smooth but I wanted a copy to just read and it works.
3,Title page dedicated,"Did not realize the title page had been dedicated. Wanted to give as a gift, but could not. Otherwise in great shape."
1,Waste of money,"I had a Desiderata poster on my bedroom wall when I was 16 yo. I shared the Desiderata with my 19 yo son and he liked it well enough to request a poster for HIS bedroom wall.We were quite disappointed with the book. It has only a few lines per page and lacks the kind of flow which allows enjoyment. Maybe personal preference.I easily found a printable copy online and used Best Quality and printed it on nice paper. Quick and easy. Not as nice as a poster size, but fine nonetheless.I could have saved some money."
1,Make sure you get the right book,I read the reviews and the comments on the photos. I ordered the $10 paperback version. I am very disappointed to find no photos in this version. One page- one sentence. No photos. I am very disappointed. My advice- stay away from the paperback version.
1,Desiderata,I was very disappointed that someone would create a book in such a manner. This beautiful piece could be printed on a single page. To print one sentence per page was something a child would do and could not get away with.
2,Horrible writing,"I grabbed this book because I'm fascinated with Mayan history.I was sorry I spent the time on it. Although the historical information was quite good, the mystery was awful: cardboard characters, an obvious villian, unbelievable dialog, overuse of the same adjectives over and over. The author even interrupts the climax to explain the theme to us poor, brain-dead readers.This book only deserves two stars (rather than one) for its excellent historical research, which is well presented. As a mystery, it's horrid. I play to say far away from Lyn Hamilton in the future. However, if anyone would like to read a good Mayan-history based book, Pat Murphy's ""The Falling Woman"" (Tor) is a fantastic book. It's not a mystery, rather a fantasy or magical-realism book, but it's quite wonderful and has all the element that this book lacks."
2,Unbeievable Ending,"I really wanted to like this book because I love mysteries and have always been fascinated with Mexico and its history (and the research of the book seems flawless, at least to this non-expert). And the writing is swift, clean, almost humorous sometimes. In fact, I'd call it 3/4 of a good (not great) book. But it nosedives into implausibility and oversimplification. A quick ""readable"" disappointment."
2,Disconnect,"I was excited to read this book, I love both archaeology and mysteries, however, I was disappointed with the read. I never felt any connection with the main charactor. Just spewing forth about a charactors obstacles in her life does not connect a reader to her, nor does it round out her charactor. More is needed to prevent her (the charactor) from seeming distant.The parts of the book that should have been exciting were not. I was actually bored with the action. The Mayan history was good. It could have been used better to bring the plot along...instead of presented in a lecture type manner.Perhaps this is just a first novel and the author improves with future books. I will give another a try, simply because I love the possibilies of the themes."
1,Dull Writing,"The basic idea of the story was good. The execution was bad. The author discusses what the main character had for breakfast in the same tone as she discusses finding a dead body. ""I had huevos rancheros and strong coffee. Then I found a body under the pile of rubble."" Blah, blah, blah. There was NO tension, NO excitement in the writing. She skipped over the most potentially exciting scenes in the book with a few sentences and dwelled on the main character's dislike of her husband and obsession with food."
4,Satisfying!,"This was truly one of the most satisfying reads I've had in a while, especially from a mystery. The integration of Mexican and Mayan history throughout the narrative was both informative and entertaining and supported the story, rather than detracting from it. I also loved the evolution of the heroine, Lara, from a self-pitying in the beginning to stronger and more confident in the end. While I was perturbed by the rather obvious choice of villain, I do think that the way the reveal was handled both supported the plot of the book and the personal development of its lead character."
3,Just so-so...,"This book was a good enough read, but seemed lacking in excitement. It kept my interest, but it wasn't a book that you just couldn't put down."
5,"Sturhling Targo Pro ""Good Word""","This is my first Stuhrling watch, but it will not be my last. It is a beautifully crafted time piece."
3,"Good, but pity about his Electronic Gizmo on 3 Tracks.","Rusty turns in a generally fine performance on these six tracks, with fine support from the accompanying musicians. My one reservation is his use of a Conn/Multidivider on 3 tracks, that neutralises his tone, Lessening my enjoyment of his playing. Nevertheless he is a good Groovy performer who deserves to be better known!"
4,"Good smell, Not as durable as I'd like",These smell good. The smell doesn't quite last 10 dryer times. The bags are flimsy and not as durable as I'd like.
3,Nice,"These are great for the dryer, but I didn't think it lasted as long as described. Also for more full loads I needed to use 2. I would purchase these again, but only use them on specific items."
2,"Bags smell great, Laundry doesn't","These bags smell wonderful, real lavender... but my sheets do not smell even remotely like lavender after taking them out of the dryer. I'll use them for drawer scented satchels."
4,Short But Sweet,"Exceptional performances from Miles Davis and John Coltrane.Sound quality was very good. I was particularly impressed with the reproduction of the muted horns on the first track.I suspect that this was originally a mono recording, since the stereo separation was narrower than more modern recordings. But still,a very good remastering job.My only disappointment,... listening time is just under 35 minutes."
3,This SACD is Stereo Only not Multi-ch,While the music on this SACD is 5 Stars the SACD has only Stereo Channels and not Multi-ChannelsAmazon: Please find a way of marking such SACD's on you web page.
4,Enchanting,"I first picked up Enchantress because the book took place in medieval times. I am a sucker for books written in that time period. I traditional stay away from romance novels, I find them all them the same. This particular book intrigued me. I felt that the author laid out the sex scene in such a way that the scenes went with the book. This book is not just another book about sex with some plot about it. It captured me. The beginning of this book was slow, and hard to get into, but most good books are. If you are a sucker for books with the medieval setting, you will love this book too."
2,Review of Domhoff's Dreams,"This is an incredibly dry, uninspiring work of scientific literature. It does an effective job of present new developments in dream science since the activation-synthesis, including those of Solms and Foulkes. However, the majority of this work is bogged down with precise discussion of experiments and the author's favored dream-content analysis method. Compared with Hobson's 'The Dreaming Brain,' this work feels like a very weak response."
3,"Not for novices, and oh my so dry","My area of interest is REM sleep and dreaming and I have read many books and scientific journal articles on the subject. This book is full of statistics and data and is so dry I became dehydrated reading it. It is a good resource for someone who is conducting research on the cognitive aspects of dreams and their content. It is not a good book to get if you are new to the subject. Please read my ""So you want to...learn about sleep and dreams"" for some great recommendations on the subject."
5,Has Steven Spielberg Read Exhortation?,"Couldn't put the Book down for a moment! There were so many twists and turns with these characters, it appeared like I was reading 'Raiders of The Lost Ark'! When is the movie coming out? Has Steven Spielberg read Exhortation?"
4,Light cool glove,"I live in southern Az. so a light ventilated glove is a must. These are a good basic knitted glove that fasten securely . I've not had them long so don't know how well they'll hold up to use and washing. The main issue I had was getting gloves that fit. I wear a size 9 in all other gloves I've gotten. In this glove, I had to order a 10 to get a proper fit-the 10 fit perfectly."
5,Gloves,I bought for my wife for Christmas. She specified the SSG gloves and they fit perfect. Shipped as promised. Will order the same when these wear out.
5,This book is superb!,"If you love shoes as much as me, and that would be a whole lot considering the fact that I have an whole walk in closit full of shoes, then you would love this book. This book explains all about shoes from all over the world! I enjoyed it so much because I enjoy learning about shoes. This is amazing because I usually hate reading!"
3,Wanted better pics,"Good writing & an interesting take on R Chandler, but the pics are from the 70's - should have been from the 30's-40's."
3,Great Sound,The dinner bell is big and has a loud distinctive sound which is what we were looking for. Assembling the dinner bell was easy if you are creative as there were not any instructions. Our only disappointment was the bell does not move smoothly as the swivel points are rough and will need grinding and sanding. Good value for the price but expect to do some work.
3,Good as a Secondary weapon,This is a great gun for first time players or for use as a secondary weapon. It is really small but that is great becasue i use it for cqb as i am a sniper. could be more powerful but modding it is unadvused. Just get a new gun when its time to upgrade. i love it for now
2,DONT GET,"Please dont get this gun! I bought this thinking it was full size, but was 3:4 scale. I can hardly shoot 40 feet with this thing, and youd be luck to hit anywhere near your target. stock is flimsy, mine snapped with minimal use, and BBs are SLOW!! i can outrun them, and im fat! do youself a favor and get a spring version, its a little work cocking it after every shot, but most are fast and acurate."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"this gun suck!! the second i got it the battery cover broke!!! this gun is a peice of crap!!!!! dont buy it u will regret it!!! and the gun only shots like 2 feet with full battery life.... do me a favore and dont buy it...pros: shots fastcons: brakes really easy, really hard to reload,doesnt even shot far,just a horrible gun..."
1,do not buy this gun,"i bought it and on the first day the battery stopped working no matter how long i charged it. the instruction manual didnt even tell you how long you should charge it. it wasn't accurate with .12 or .2g bbs even in semi auto mode. breaks easily and i didn't even use it except for target shooting. clip sucks you have to shake the gun to get rounds from the reservoir into the clip. DON""T BUY THIS GUN! its the worstAEG ive ever seen."
1,DON'T GET THIS GUN!,"I got this gun a couple of weeks ago, and already it stopped firing. The orange tip comes off easily, and the mag only holds 15 rounds! This guns sucks!"
2,Confusing,"After reading this book, which reads more like a piece of propaganda work, I'm not sure whether these poor women were actual brides or ""comfort women"" (no disrespect intended... I'm trying to be skeptical)."
4,A bold new political idea,"Robertson makez an excellent case for smaller, ethnically homogeneous states to replace the strife-ridden imperial states like the modern United States. Although Robertson will undoubtably be vilified as ""Nazi"" or ""fascist"" by liberal bigots, he is in fact advocating a more democratic state that is actually responsive to its citizens, not to international corporations and special interests. The ideas are sound, but there isn't too much on how we might actually implement his ideas."
1,False description - only covers 1 bike!,"I purchased this cover to use over 2 Trek bikes with small handlebars. No matter how I oriented the cover, it would not zipper over the two bikes. It barely fit over one, for that matter, when it was on my bike carrier. I returned this item for a refund and would not recommend it."
2,"Newer but not better. You want ""The Best of Meco""","Probably, anyone looking at this is expecting the mega-hit Star Wars Meco single, from over twenty years ago. This ain't it. This is an album of new material, with weak rapping over Star Wars sampling, and tepid songs about Star Wars topics, like the Force and fate, and destiny.You should instead look for the ""The Best of Meco"" which DOES include the fantastic Star Wars disco single, the Empire Strikes Back follow-up song, as well as the lesser known Close Encounters disco single. That's the groovy disco flash back that we all knew and loved, not this ""Star Wars Party."" The party is over on the OTHER album!"
5,"""STAR WARS PARTY BY MECO""","Wow! I just listened to Meco's Star Wars Party and it is smoking!! None of those old-fashioned instrumentals here. All ten songs are either vocals or characters rapping to the beat. My favorites are ""I Am Your Father"" in which Vader tells Luke the awful truth about himself - ""Live Your Life"" where we are told that if we live our lives like a Jedi, then the Force will be with us! - and how could you not love those Wookiees bogeying on down with Chewie making it funky on ""Boogie Wookiee""? Five stars!!!"
2,Need new Voice Actors!! Ones that sound like the Movie Actors!,"I was expecting so much more... its not bad for what i paid for it.. Which i think was a total of 6 bucks? The funniest thing is they have people dub in the actors and use their sayings... They dont even sound like the original actors saying the lines in the movie. Not sure why they didnt just use that, Wookies sound real."
3,This album recommended only if you are a die hard Star Wars fan,"Favorite tracks were #5 ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and #8 ""Lapti Nek"" for they had the feel of his earlier work which I still prefer. Like the CD: The Best of Meco. Wouldn't it be awesome if Meco came out with another compilation album that included many other Sci-Fi themes in addition to Star Wars?!"
5,Foxtrot at its best!,This is a collection of some of the books of Foxtrot with the great bonus of a better arrangment of the strips to better appreciation of the artistic work. And the work is great.
5,Shania Twain--Ultimate Tribute.,Very nice and relaxing instrumental tribute to Shania. A must for Shania fans. You will like this CD.
4,A special book we'll use year after year,"_Christmas for 10_ is a new Christmas tradition at our house. The simple rhymes tend to get lost as we're reading the book, but it's because we're enjoying the pictures and concepts so much.The family in the book prepares for Christmas, and we count as they prepare. Each picture is very beautifully done and makes a great starting point for a discussion of families, working together, and Christmas, just to name a few. The book places the emphasis of Christmas on the family spending time together, not on receiving gifts. Three generations enjoy the preparations, ending with my 2.5yo son's favorite page where ""ten joyful folks wish peace for all!""This is a truly special book. I'm already looking forward to next Christmas."
5,Christmas for 10,"I received the book in a timely m manner, was a great book for the holidays and also learning the numbers 1 - 10. I am a preschool teacher and the children enjoyed this book very much."
1,Dosages too large!,"I tried Mindell's remedy for headaches (page 221). One part of his remedy called for taking 200 mg of b-complex per day. When I told a health care professional that I was taking 200 mg of b-complex per day he said that it was too much. I got a second opinion and he said the same thing. I cut back the dosage from 200 mg to 150 mg per day and I developed anemia, my toe nails started to turn black and fall out. I developed hypoacidity as well as liver problems and my hair started to turn gray. I had never had these problems in the past. Bottom line...in some cases the dosages that Mindell is advocating are too large."
4,"Lots of good information, though hard to find","Since my wife & I found this book, it has been THE reference source for vitamins and minerals. The organization isn't the greatest at times; it's not easy, for example, to look up ""potassium"" and find everything you want to know in one spot. However, the comprehensive index will make up for that. I've already ordered the ""21st Century"" update edition."
4,Soul + Punk = Greatness,"This is my favourite GP album. Although it does not have the rock & roll grandeur of ""Squeezing Out Sparks"", this album clearly ranks as one of the best albums of the 1970's."
2,Short Stories That Hit & Miss,"The stories were too short. Some were really good some not so good. Half the stories I liked. There were a few stories I just thought they missed the mark or I just wasn't into it. There were several stories with same sex partners. There was one story about a woman having sex with the wind. Plus, one story about an imaginary non-existant lover. Don't get me wrong I have a very vivid imagination, but those two stories and a few more were too out there for me. Needless to say I will pass when I see this authors books in the future. But, I will say if you are into fetishs ex. hair, daddy or mommy complex, beastyality and into lesbian erotic stories this book is for you. It was more miss than hit for me."
1,Disappointed,I love erotica and have yet to read a book I did not like in any way...until now. I find the author very educated with an excellent use of those vocabulary words which are rarely used by most. (Get out your dictionary). I don't know French so the multiple French phrases were annoying. If you can get beyond that then the stories are o.k.
3,"Some of the stories excellent, some not so much....","Well, my title pretty much sums it up. There are a few stories in this book that make it worth purchasing, but then there are some that you want to skip. Thus, three stars."
3,Good!,I've read a few of the stories and they are good. Looks like the book has a variety of stories and techniques.
3,Keeps my thighs from burning,"I'm not sure that it helps with actually keeping my computer any cooler--but my laptop tends to sit on my thighs and this buffer between the computer and my thighs is much needed. Yes, this really is a non-slip heatshield--wouldn't say cooler, but the other statements are fair. I'm glad that I purchased the product and it is very light and compact. Good for a traveler like myself."
1,disappointed!!! cheap foam covered in cheap plastic,it did not make any difference laptop continued to overheat complete waste of money DONT BUT THIS!!!
5,Original X-Pad a Great Addition to My Laptop,"I've had lots of time to work with the original X-Pad. This accessory provides not only great cooling and ventilation qualities, but also a stable, slightly elevated work surface which greatly facilitates extended work sessions. Quality is outstanding and downright first class. I'm very happy I purchased this X-Pad."
2,Not-cool,"I didn't have extremely high expectations of this product. I just wanted something to keep my lap cool. I didn't expect an active cooler with fans and all. If your laptop is getting so hot that it needs the fan driven cooler to operate properly, then something's wrong with your laptop. Seemed like a good design idea, light weight, good size, good airflow to help cool things and shield heat. My lap still gets very hot from laptop heat. Additionally the bottom of this feels like it's made of a poorly snapped in very light and cheap plastic, which has sharp bottom edges. A better cushioning bottom and insulation would have made this product much better."
4,Works for me.,It has been beneficial in keeping my computer cooler. It does not drain battery like fan models. Overall pleased!
1,not impressed with this product....it needs a fan,"I have had this product for almost 2 months now. I have a 17 inch as well as a 14 inch that i use on this, and while it does provide ventilation, it doesn't do enough to cool down the temperature when it gets high. For the price i paid for it, i expected it to be much more efficient at cooling. I've had to lift my laptop off of the pad on occasion, and literally use a magazine as a fan to cool down the temperature. This product definitely needs a fan built in. Furthermore, the rubber covering the vents has peeled off in various spots from the weight of my 17 inch laptop, while holding it at an angle. I would have expected the rubber to hold up much longer and withstand the friction of heavier laptops. I wouldn't buy this product again. I felt ripped after being able to use it this long."
5,Perfect product,"As with most laptops, the fan on mine is located on the bottom, which is a poor design. This product solves that issue and simply allows more exposed surface area. This alone cools down the computer enough, my fan rarely even kicks in. (It only turns on when the CPU reaches a high enough temperature) Although the specs of my computer are not phenomenal, I can still play games that have a high demand for power since the X Pad always keeps it cool enough to operate as though it has just been restarted."
5,Beats the Heat,"I have had one of these for 4 years. I bought it because of the exceptional review it got on c-net's testing for reducing heat. We own a Dell and it has lasted for quite a while longer than some of oue friend's Dells. It is a bother to have to carry around two seperate pieces from room to room, but that is going to happen with any cooler pad. Initially, it seemed bulky and akward, but no more than any other pad, and you get used to it. Now it is second nature to just grab them together and carry it like they were on unit. Like the title says ""it beats the heat"" which is all I really care about."
5,"Slim, Simple, Effective","The Xpad's construction is simple but functional and effective. There are no fans to crap out-no moving parts to fail. My 15"" MacBook Pro generates a lot of heat on the left bottom of the laptop, making it uncomfortable to place it on your lap for more that brief periods. With the Xpad in use, the heat is allowed to escape via the Xpad so that the bottom of the Xpad that lays on your lap is cool and comfortable. The Xpad rubber pads keep your laptop from sliding or skidding away. I've been very pleased-particularly since I didn't buy an alternative product that required a fan to be plugged into a USB port for power.The magic of the Xpad is it's simplicity, which achieves functionality without a lot of bell and whistles!"
5,"Simple, clever design and excellent functionality.","The Xpad is extremely simple and functional. It thankfully requires no USB connection that would use energy and occupy a valuable USB port. It works just by increasing airflow to the computer for better circulation and also by absorbing the heat itself. It keeps you and your computer cool, it's lightweight, and it's small enough to fit in a laptop bag (although I don't have one, I imagine the Xpad slim is even more amenable to transport).After a year or so, when the Xpad is exposed to prolonged use (3+ hours of constant computer time), it will become warm enough to cause discomfort. That would probably be a good time to take a time out. The only other problem with the original Xpad is that the fabric on the underside of the pad will become worn with age.I really can't fault the designers for my occasionally absurd computer habits, though, so I give the product a 5-star rating for everything but durability."
2,Xpad (Non-slip Laptop Cooler and Heatshield),I would not purchase this item again. It is non-slip but it doesn't cool Laptop as it says it does. I have better luck just using a wedge at the back of my computer to lift it up. I use it on a table most of the time. It keeps the right side of my computer cool but the middle and left side heats up as bad as ever. I purchased this item from Amazon.com
2,Low quality but effective,I don't really know how long it will last because it feels flimsy and low-quality. But the design idea is a good one and it is effective. It definitely does the job. I wouldn't complain if it was 10 bucks.
3,Xpad vs. Chopping board,"I've had the Xpad for a few months now, and I have to admit that I don't use my macbook without it, and I don't get my legs fried anymore (they still get warm though). It's light to carry around, non slippery at all, and I like that I don't have to plug it to a USB port.However, my first impression was that it looks and feels cheap and crappy. It looked way better online. Don't expect miracles in benchmarks for your CPU's temperature. To compare, I put the Xpad away and started using a plastic chopping board instead for like 20 minutes and I got similar results temperature wise. I would have given the board 1 star cause it would look weird in public; because I think the Xpad does block the heat a little bit better, and because the laptop keeps sliding around. On the board's defense, it wasn't designed for this ;)"
2,Don't expect too much,"This is just a basic piece of hard plastic with a padded cloth bottom. I expected a little better construction and better heat desipitation. It does okay, again, for basic plastic that just helps elevate the laptop for better ventilation. Should be cheaper too. May consider a fan one next time instead."
1,This vendor's customer service does not exist,"I ordered this prouct on 5/10 and of course my charge card was hit with the cost that same day. The order was confirmed and shown to be ""in stock"". By 5/21 I had still not received, so emailed the vendor direct. I was then told it was backordered, they were to receive on 5/28, and it would definitely ship to me on 5/29. Got an email that said it had shipped Priority Mail on 6/1. By 6/7 had STILL not received so contacted Amazon.com and was eventually refunded. Thank you Amazon.com for standing behind your sales, but ""Buyer Beware"" ... stay away from Edova Innovations!!"
2,Meh,"I read a review saying that this cooled all heating problems for the Alienware 7700 laptop. Tis a lie, they must mean the 15"" version cause it made my 17"" 7700 heating problem worse. I put it on, and my computer instantly began to reheat. It was a waste."
1,Not the same model as in the picture,"The product I received in the mail is not the same as the one listed above. I sold it off to a friend with a netbook since the thing was far too tiny for my 17"" laptop.. I havent heard any complaints from her so far. but it felt very flimsy and cheap to me. I have purchased another item which i enjoy far more.."
4,Good Stuff.,This is all I need to insolate my lap top from my desk which surface is made of wood that conserves too much warm by it self and this is not good for electronics components.
2,Xpad is disappointing,"I eagerly awaited what I thought to be the find of the new century!Alas, I've been very disappointed. The product doesn't seem to absorb any heat at all, instead, it holds the heat in the rubber padding, thuskeeping my laptop hot. I kept it anyway, I don't know why."
2,It's Plastic,"First, be aware this unit is plastic. Plastics are generally not a good conductor of heat and this seems like a cheap plastic. So it is painted grey to make it look like the Macbook's aluminum unibody. The biggest problem is the bottom edge is rather sharp for the lap. It can become very uncomfortable while wearing shorts. And the price is too high for what you get."
2,"No slip true, Heat protection not exactly!","Well the non slip part is true. However the heat protection is only partial. the computer still gets warm and the heat seeps through to the bottom, and on to your lap. So it is only partially fulfilling its description."
1,worst customer service ever,"took a month to get the product. they said they had too many orders to satisfy, but took 3 emails for them to even tell me that. they said they would credit my account $5 for waiting a month, and 2 weeks after they have said that, still no credit. do not buy from these people."
2,KEEPS THINGS COOL - BUT NOT FOR LONG,"This laptop heat shield does work - for a while. However, if you plan on using your laptop for more than say 45 minutes then this product will not adequately insulate you from the increasing heat of your machine. I even used 2 pads stacked on top of each other and the majority of heat still transferred. I wish the laptop makers could find a way to make their machines run cooler."
2,All depends,"One of the rubber feet falls right under my processor and fan, so my laptop runs hotter on the pad than without. If I tilt the laptop so the fan is clear of the foot, it works fine, but its very awkward. Look at the bottom of your laptop, and see how its going to work out.If the feet fall in a good position for you, this would be a good pad. The laptop does not slip, and the pad is durable and light."
3,Good solution,"Great solution, works well. Nevertheless, the metal edges are a little bit uncomfortable on the legs."
3,keeps heat away; bad designed bottom makes it uncomfortable,"The product does keep away the heat and helps my laptop stay cool. However, the bottom of the lap desk is badly designed and has sharp metal edges that stick out further than the pad on the bottom that can be quite uncomfortable on the legs."
2,20 plus 6 dollars shipping = I paid way too much,"this isn't a BAD product, but it is still a rip-off There simply isn't enough materials/workmanship that went into this to justify the cost - it's a square of plastic with rubber pads on top - that's it, no more, no less. I trusted the scores of positive reviews here on Amazon, and I got burned. If it cost what it should, $12.99 all told, it'd be worth it."
4,Simple and effective,"I'm very pleased with the Xpad. I ordered this because my Lenovo X61t gets extremely hot, especially when playing games or using graphics-intensive programs. I primarily use my notebook away from a desk or table, so it's either on my lap or being held.This is hands down the best *lap* notebook cooler I've seen so far. Even after several hours of use, I had no heat from the computer on the underside of the xpad. The underside of the xpad is covered with a slightly rough fabric that works comfortably on clothes or bare skin.Pros:* no moving parts, so nothing to mysteriously break in a few weeks* works on lap or table* very light* fits in many laptop bags* design accommodates a wide variety of laptop sizes, intake, and fan configurations* stiff design won't block air intakes on bottom of laptopCons:* plastic case is slightly deeper than the foam pad; could dig into bare skin, depending on position of of pad."
5,Xpad (Non-slip Laptop Cooler & Heatshield),"This product is awesome! It's lightweight and does the job! It keeps my lap cool and also keeps the laptop, itself, cooler. One of the things that attracted me to this item, is that unlike many others, this one does not use any electricity! Many similar items needed to be powered by a usb connection. This one is a very impressive design! No power needed... and works great!!"
5,Inexpensive solution to a big problem,"I use my laptop all day long and rarely at my desk (where I have my larger desktop computer). Whether I'm sitting on the patio or riding in the car, this very lightweight piece of gear is a lap saver! It easily fits in my laptop carrying case and weighs next to nothing. It's a practical solution that really works! And at the price you can't beat it. I've bought two - one for my brother-in-law and one for myself. It was a great gift - my bro-in-law uses his just as much as I use mine."
5,"A durable, comfortable essential for my MacBook!","I've owned the original X-Pad for over three years now, and I still use it every day, all day with my laptop. I even bought several for friends and family members to use. It does a great job dissipating the heat, it's comfortable and lightweight, and obviously it's durable given the length of time I've used it (and the abuse it's taken). It's travelled well with me on numerous trips for both business and pleasure.One odd thing I noticed on the negative review voted most helpful on this site is the reference to sharp edges. Perhaps the model that reviewer owned was older than the one I bought several years ago, but I have my XPad on my lap as I type this, and there are NO sharp edges anywhere.The XPad is far more unobtrusive than the products you'll find at most office supply or department stores for laptop cooling, and I wouldn't trade mine for any other product. For a small investment, you'll reap the benefits many times over!"
5,Works as promised!,"I ordered this heatshield while traveling last year after the active shield I packed got tweaked while in use and broke the fan (grrr). After looking around for a replacement, I saw this product and gave it a try.My 15"" HP laptop has an unusually hot processor and was impossible to use without a desk or table before I tried this XPad. Since it doesn't need its own power supply, there are no cords to pack, lose or fail. I have the original model from last summer and it is a bit thicker than I would like as my laptop bag is small with the cords packed in, but this is my only complaint! If I needed a new one, I would opt for the thinner redesign, but don't feel I need to toss the one I have been using for a year.It is very lightweight and nonslip and I never use the laptop without it, even at home. Overall, a great purchase that hasn't landed in the heap of unused peripherals in my office closet."
4,x-pad excells!,"I've had the original x-pad for almost five years now; initially using it for my pc laptop and currently with my 17"" macbook pro this past year. I like that it keeps the heat off the lap and seems to keep the computer cooler. Since getting my macbook pro, I've added some rubber feet to the x-pad (placed on top of the black rubber) in order to elevate the computer higher and keep it cooler ( I did this once I noticed the macbook pro heating up more than I thought reasonable, and it seems to work!). Under the x-pad, I use a belkin cushtop notebook stand, and find the combination effective and pleasing--yes, even with a 17"" macbook pro!"
5,A must have item,"Well worth while - a must have bargain. I have used one of these constantly for four years. Stops heat reaching my lap from my Sony Vaio. No problems with it or laptop slipping due to rubber pads. I always take the X-pad when travelling. It is light and slim. Apart from some wear of the colour on the corners it is still as good as new. Particularly useful in hot climates. I visit India regularly. A really well designed bargain. My son, duaghter-in-law and niece have also have X-pads and are equally pleased with them.An essential item for me until computer manufacturers build such heat shields into their laptops and avoid airvents on the underside."
5,xpad laptop cooler,"Works very well. Fits my Dell Vostro 1500 15"" inch laptop fine.It has raised rubber pads (in X shape) that your laptop sits on. All it does is elevates your laptop to allow air flow.Most laptops have a built in fan under it, so placing a laptop on a desk restricts the air and can overheat it.This works great and I can feel the hot air blowing out when I place my hand on the left-side of my elevated laptop."
5,Chill out!,"I LOVE my Xpad. I have a 15.5"" Mac Book Pro. The X Pad keeps it cool. It is so slim that I even use it when I travel. It's wonderful.We also bought one to put under our PlayStation 2.I highly recommend this product."
4,Works Great,"I bought this for a laptop that was too hot to hold (turned out to be a heat-sink problem on the CPU). This product, without requiring power and with no moving parts, kept my laptop from over-heating and comfortable enough on my lap so I could still use it. Even after the heat-sink problem was fixed, and now that I have a different laptop, I still use this. It's slim enough that I can carry it in my laptop bag, but leaves enough space under the laptop for plenty of cooling. It's also more comfortable in my lap than holding the actual laptop because of the cushioned bottom and distributed weight. There's only one thing I would change: the edges along the bottom are squared, hard plastic that dig a little into the skin on my legs. But that's a very minor complaint, and not a problem unless I'm wearing shorts."
3,Xpad Size,"My compliments to a good design job--but with one big caveat: they state it works for laptops up to 17"". it does not. the pad is too small for a 17"" and thus one leg of the ""X"" covers the fan. it still attempts to dissipate heat but appears to do a barely adequate job."
5,Great Product - Worse Seller Ever,Product works.Do N O T buy from EDOVA Innovations LLC!!! If they're only place you can buy this then don't by it.
3,A simple plate but nothing more,It's just a lift-up plate for your laptop to allow room for your laptop fan to work. Over-priced for its value.
2,"Not built for 17"" laptop","Their site states that it will fit a 17"" laptop, because the rubber feet just have to touch the pads on the Xpad. The problem is that the rubber feet do not all touch the pads on the Xpad. My laptop wound up producing even more heat than it did while it was on my lap. Since they require signature confirmation to return the item, it cost me more to ship it back. By the time I was done paying all the fees, I wound up paying for half the cost of the Xpad. I found the perfect lapdesk by Sharper Image. It fits a 17"" laptop, has risers to lift the laptop up, has a mouse pad that attaches to the side, and it has built in wrist supports. I love it. I am sure this would have been ok had I had a smaller laptop. I just trusted them when they said it would fit a 17' laptop."
4,"XPAD, great product",I bought the XPAD for a few reasons but the main one was to ensure my MAC was able to remain cool whilst in use. The product works extremely well and I bought another one so they can be used my all the family. The only down side which I think has been resolved in the latest model is the cloth on the bottom eventually came off.
5,Works Great!,"Although, it took a month to get this item, it was worth the wait. This laptop cooler & heatshield really works. I spend hours on my laptop lying down because of a bad back and prior to getting the xpad, I would have to put my laptop down and shut it down, as the laptop heat was not only very hot on my lap, but also, my entire body. I should have bought it a long time ago."
1,"Disappointed, you get what you pay for","After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to give this product a try. Unfortunately, I tried using if for a week and my Toshiba laptop still remains hot, actually it feels as if it got even hotter when I use the Xpad. At least, it was only a $20 loss, I'll probably try to sell the product on eBay."
5,Great product for a great price,"The XPad for Laptop (original version) is a simple product that does a very important job: it helps keep your laptop from overheating. It has no moving parts, and requires no electricity to run. The design is simple and rather elegant, providing an extra bit of airspace under your laptop to allow for circulation. It also protects your work surface (desk, table, your legs, etc.) from the heat that today's laptops can generate. The bottom is padded, making it fairly comfortable to use on your lap for an extended period.I have been using my XPad for several years now, and it is hardly the worse for wear. I have a 15"" MacBook Pro from 2007, which fits on the XPad with a small amount of overhang; my wife's 13"" MacBook fits better.I even purchased a few more for laptops at the office."
5,Xpad functions well,"When I first obtained my laptop my research informed me that the #1 cause of laptop failure was overheating. I was uncomfortable with pads with built-in fans. I discovered the Xpad. I purchased one and have had it and my laptop for 3 years with no overheating. It, the Xpad, has done what it said it would do. Unusual in this day of hyperbole and deception. I recommend it."
5,you need this protection,"this cooler effectively ensures ventilation under my laptop, slows down some but not all heat radiation into my lap. I installed velcro adhesive strips at all four corners of my laptop to the cooler so I can keep together or remove at will. I am very pleased with this setup, even though it adds additional bulk and weight overall. My laptop now runs cooler and I have no concerns with overheating. The cooler is lightweight, strong, and very well made. I would never run my unit without it."
4,I like it,"This is really helpgul, it doesnt cool your laptop as much as you expect, but it is less heat for the battery, and you can take it everywhere."
3,great cooler if your laptop isn't huge,"This is a great product that works well under laptops that are not to big. My new laptop is a 17"" widescreen with a fullsize keyboard and no matter how I maneuver it none of the feet sit on the pads. The pad literally fits between all four of the laptops feet with at least an 1/8 inch gap on one side. My laptopp is a cyberpower so either the feet are placed too widely apart on this particular brand of laptop or new laptops are just being made too wide for the xpad. It still seems to offer some cooling but I doubt it is working optimally. The size issues are the only reason for my giving the product 3 stars because I bought one for my old alienware and it works great with that plus I got one for my sister in law and she loves hers. Incidentally my sister in laws dell is also a widescreen laptop and she did not have the issues with it fitting that I had."
5,Sometimes all you need is a basic,"I received the Xpad as a gift 2 months ago and I was skeptical. It was a gift so I gave it a try. It is perfect, I use it everyday, evreywhere. My laptop doesn't slide off, no matter what angle I use it in. And it doesn't use any of your battery power like the ones that have fans! It goes wherever my laptop goes. I have a Dell E1405 Widescreen, but I think that it will work with most laptops. I am buying one as a Christmas gift for someone. Sometimes the simplest item is best!"
3,Decent cooling without power,"I personally think a non-powered cooling pad is a nice idea for laptops with less accessible USB slots or mobile laptops, so this is worth considering. However I have to say it didn't cool as much as I would like.I haven't had issues yet with the pad's ""hard edges"" (as in other reviews) but maybe it's me -- it's true the padding doesn't extend on the bottom like others may want. The top may be no-slip, but the bottom is not.In addition, it seems like 20-25 bucks is a bit expensive for foam mounted on plastic. The product is still high quality, but it may be worth trying your own X shaped foam pad before spending the money for this."
5,"""Cooler than Cool""","Just got my Xpad today...love it! My legs are no longer ""french fries"". You save $$$ & time, no battery drain or use of electricity. It is very comfortable in my lap and laptop doesn't slide around as the alternative use of my pillow. During the summer heat it's a dream come true. Staying COOL in Bothell, WA!!"
2,Not really non-slip,"Got it today. So far so good. Except for one thing: I'm on my recliner with legs elevated 10 to 20 degrees. I'm using an IBM T43 with the pad, and the laptop keeps slipping towards me.The ""feet"" on the laptop are rubber, but the rubber on the ""X"" is slippery, and that's right out of the box. It's like someone put butter on the X-Pad. I'll try to wash it and see.It's so NOT non-slip, that I can push the laptop back, and it just slides on top of the X-Pad. Normally you'd expect that rubbing one rubber against another will create friction."
1,do not buy this.,"do not buy this. all it does is keep the heat off your lap and is a raised platform for when placing on your bed, or something."
4,cool cooler,I have been using my XPAD daily for several years. It's very comfortable on my lap. The non-skid pads work. It cools well and does not have to be pluged in.The only problem that I have is that I wore out the cloth pad that rests on your lab.I just ordered a new one.
1,"Bad, doesnt help at all","Sure it fits, and if you put it under your laptop while its on your lap, it protects you from feeling the heat. But it does not cool one bit, I was very disappointed."
5,The Xpad works great!,"I've had the Xpad for over a year now, and it's still like new. I use it just about every day. Since I was so pleased with it, I bought another one for my granddaughter, when she got a laptop. She uses it all the time also. It's great being able to use my laptop on my lap for hours, without getting uncomfortable from the heat. I don't know what I'd do without it. I really like the fact that that it is a simple reliable design with no active components to fail. I don't think you can go wrong with the Xpad."
5,This is a great book!,"A workbook for life! Since about half of our brain power is in the unconsicious brain, any thing that promotes concious thinking and concious change by building new habits to replace the unwanted habits (that are not all that easy to stop) is a wonderful tool. ""A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity"" tells it all. Be prepared to change and find youself doing those things you have dreamed of doing, but doubted that you had what it takes!"
4,learn about yourself,The Artist's Way is a helpful guide to learning about who you are. There are activities for you to develop your creativity inside and out. While absorbing the ideas and teachings of the author I realized I was not alone in how I experienced the world around me. It led me to read another of Julia Cameron's books so I could continue my spiritual journey. This book will allow the reader to develop the creativity within.
2,Utter Disappointment,"A member of our art league suggestd we offer this reading to our members and form a discussion group. Well, I joined not knowing how dissappointed I would be. One, there seemed to be some frustration between those who are die hard Christins and those of us who believe, but not necessarily of one particular faith. A lot of religious overtones.Also, I was aghast that all we seemed to be doing was digging up the past and lingering on frustrations and disappointments. Most of us have overcome those issues and moved on. Why rehash it?All in all, I completed my commitiment to finish the book and be part of the discussion group, but caution that this is a book that I would not recommend to just anyone."
2,Art book or psychology book?,"Sorry, but by the time I got to the part about ""crazymakers"",I stopped reading. This book is loaded with pop psychologyand starts with the point of view that the reader is loadedwith psychological baggage that inhibits creativity. If that'swhere you are, fine. I was looking for something more along thelines of ""Drawing on the Right Side of Your Brain"", I guess."
3,"It's good, but it is ABRIDGED.","This is not an unabridged reading of the Artist's Way Book. It is an author read abridgement and Julia Cameron herself opens the audiobook discussing the abridgement process she and her friends went through to boil the book down for this audiobook.The material covered here is good and insightful, and that's why it still merits three stars. It's worth listening to, but you deserve to know what you're getting."
5,The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,The author of this book has designed an excellent resources for individuals looking to connect or reconnect with their personal creativity! The course is well-designed and quite impactful!
5,"If you want to grow as an artist, read Artist's Way","Julia Cameron is one of my all-time favorite authors, and this has to be my all-time favorite book. Easy to read and filled with practical advice, this book encourages people to commit to themselves in an effort to grow creatively. From Artist's Dates to Morning Pages, I have incorporated Cameron's suggestions into my daily life; since then, my work has become more daring and I have published several short stories. I honestly don't believe that I would have had the success of growing as an artist, if not for this book."
1,The Artists Detour,"This is one of those rare books that just tries to adress everything; creativity, spiritualty, pop psychology, twelve step program views, and the kitchen sink. It is about everything and ultimately about nothing. It reders the reader at odds with himself rather than provide a ""path."" It is actually counterproductive.A truly ghastly book."
2,Preferred the original unabridged version,I bought the version of this she published years ago on cassette tape and have worn the one last cassette I have of the original 2 cassette set to a thin memory. She did that version live and the energy from having an audience enhanced her delivery. This aspect was missing in this CD version which I'd hoped to buy as a replacement so I returned the CDs to Amazon. The return was problem free.
2,Item is just as described.,"Remember that if you buy this book, you are looking for ways to increase Higher ""spiritual creativity"" and do some things that will augment this process. I got this book because it was required reading for one of my Psychology classes."
5,A True Masterpiece,"It is hard to put into words just how important I find this book to be. I have owned at least five copies of it, giving each one away to a friend who I thought could benefit from it as much as I have.The most important tool I learned from this book is writing in a journal, every day, without fail. Since the year 2000, I have diligently tried to follow this guideline, and have completed nearly thirteen full journals.The transformation has been enormous and uncalculable.In addition to the journal writing recommendation made by this book, there are volumes of insights in this book made by the author. I am thoroughly, completely, and profoundly grateful by the sheer wisdom I have gleemed from this material. The author is a true gift on this planet. Her words, magnificient."
3,Julie Cameron offers a new way to deal with writer's block,"Writer Cameron knows what it's like to get writer's block. She tells readers that by journaling their feelings every day, they can open up their expression channel to their commercial writing and the words will flow more easily. I have tried her methods, although I have been journaling for years, and they work. By writing down your thoughts every day in a notebook, you can help get the creative juices going. She, also, discusses taking walks outdoors in the fresh air to encourage one's thoughts to flow. That definitely works for me, also. I've taken walks for years before sitting down to write. Nothing like being, alone, in fresh air, and, preferably, in a park, for getting them going. Barbara Fifield"
1,A bit dated - better books out there,"A lot of people rave about this book. I don't really get it. It feels a little bit like the 12-step program, and the author's thoughts are a little bit disorganized. It was written in a different era and it shows. Even if this book was pioneer we live in different times. I feel there are better books today on the subject. For general information about creativity, I prefer ""A Whole New Mind"" by Daniel Pink. And for a more practical how-to book on reinvention and creativity in today's world:reDESIGN: reCREATE: Reinvent Yourself and Thrive in the New Economy"
4,Useful,"I found this to be a useful book. I don't usually like book which are going to require me to do ""homework"" and often just read through ""that crap."" But, I decided to do a lot of the writing exercises in this book. I feel I learned a lot about myself. It wasn't this book as much as what I myself wrote that made a difference to me. But, this was a catalyst. And, it was a good catalyst when I decided to let it be."
5,the Artist Way Julia Cameron,"The Artist's WayThe Artist's Way WorkbookThis is an excellent guide for freeing your artist within. If you follow the suggested 12 week program it is astounding what will happen. It would be helpful for anyone, artist or not, who wanted to access their own potential."
3,Doesn't Work For Me,"Although this is a well written book that has helped many people who are blocked creatively, I couldn't get past a pivotal hurdle. This is that each day you have to write extensive journal pages called ""Morning Pages."" I tried getting on listservs to get myself motivated to make it through but I discovered that other people had the same problem I did doing those pages. However, these materials were really intended for those experiencing total creative block which I was not experiencing at the time I tried it. A friend, who was experiencing creative block, found this book much more useful than I did. If you are actually experiencing a creative block in any creative activity, you may want to try this book and/or take the accompanying course work which goes with it. This book also can be used for writers with creative block, which the title does not make clear."
2,To be honest,"Ms.Cameron has some good ideas, however the idea of the morning pages and various others are NOT HERS. They belong to a writer named Brenda Ueland, whose book ""If You Want To Write"" was published in 1938. IT was the first book in popular reading lists to deal with writer's block. Despite the real help she has provided for some people, I think it is rather shameful that Ms. Cameron didn't give credit where credit was due. You can still get Brenda Ueland's book."
5,This book truly changed my outlook on life and my creativity,"I completed the twelve weeks this summer and thoroughly enjoyed the process. Reading the book and working through the exercises each week put me back in touch with myself and my creativity. I shall continue to write my morning pages and to keep my artist dates, even though I have finished the program. I would highly recommend this to creative people in any field who have let work and ""responsibilities"" take over their entire lives."
1,not much content,"This book may impress many people because of its psycho-lingo, its New Age palaver, and its abundance of second person pronouns. There is a 12-week program to follow, but that is probably for the author's desire to become a cult leader and the readers' desire to become cult followers.But if you want to learn something you don't already know, you might be disappointed. The message of the book, in fifty words or less, is to resist any friends, relatives, or guilty feelings which tell you that creative pursuit is a waste of time.That is nothing new. A Transactional Analyst might say the same thing, using the terms Parent and Child. A Freudian might say the same thing, using the terms superego and id."
1,Disappointed,"I actually wanted a Christian book and was encouraged by those that complained about that element. The author actually says god can be whatever you want to call it and gives a variety of examples. That aside, it is really just common sense suggestions such as setting aside time to meditate daily through writing as well as setting aside time weekly to practice your craft whether it is writing, painting or acting. Good suggestions but nothing new."
5,Exactly as described and timely,"The item when received was exactly as described, in perfect condition and it arrived quickly. I was very pleased with my experience."
5,Gentle push to take creative chances,"I am currently working my way through this book, and it's amazing to me. Cameron seems to know what I'll be thinking next, and helping me through it on the path to creative freedom. I find myself looking forward to the time I'll spend on the exercises each day, and feeling more optimistic about my life as a creative person. I'm starting to believe that this is not a temporary boost that will last until the final page, but a life-long shift in attitude towards creating and living. Okay, this sounds really starry-eyed, but I believe anyone who approaches this book with an open mind will be changed for the better and happier."
5,Take a journey into creative recovery or self discovery...,"This book is a GREAT tool to fill your creative well. In the process you will discover joys you had pushed aside. The main tools in this twelve week workbook are the morning pages and the artist's date. Each day you journal three pages and each week you make a date with yourself. It is about nurturing and caring for yourself.Often times we beat ourselves up after the world gives us the message that we are not good enough, smart enough, etc. This book peels back the layers to your true self.WARNING! This book takes work. However it is fun. If you find a group to work with you will find synergy within the group and great insights through sharing. I facilitate groups using this book and the Vein of Gold and the results are amazing."
2,Not for professional artists,"I agree with some of the naysayers of this book. I was told to read this ages ago and couldn't get through it. I write, draw, make films and have been involved and music and dance as well. This book is only for beginners who don't have a grasp of their creative spark, or who aren't artists at all. As someone who has always been creative, it's like going back to kindergarten. The idea that this is the best way to make art is preposterous ... there are as many ways as there are artists."
3,Helps to have a support group,"Got this book for an Artist's Way course and I'm glad I'm in the weekly course or I wouldn't do the projects. For me, I need to not only be held accountable but also to hear what others are doing as they open their path. It also helps to have a facilitator who is open and offers suggestions. The book is rather dated and doesn't take into account the time we spend on the internet and how that needs to be balanced."
1,Just follow your dreams.,"You don't need Ms. Cameron's book to inspire creativity. It was a waste of my time to do daily pages. I got to where I just sat and stared at the blank page before me. My time was better spent practicing my drawing and music. If you're blocked - a walk in the park will do more for you than the daily pages and exercises. Ms. Cameron suggests an artist's date - time you spend by yourself doing something you want to do....a picnic in the park, a visit to an art museum, etc. You don't need a book to tell you this."
2,The Artist's Way,The book had the highest intentions...but there is no alert regarding the author's wish to include the religiousaspect of creation.
1,The Book Might be Good--The Audio Tapes are Unlistenable!,"I really don't know if the book ""The Artist's Way"" by Julia Cameron is good or not. I have never read it--but I was handed the AUDIO TAPES READ BY THE AUTHOR, and I could barely get through side one of the first tape. I ended up shutting it off a few minutes into the second side of tape one. The reason isn't because of the content of the tape but the way the information is presented: in boring monotone sentences that end in question marks. ""What I want you to do? Is to find a notebook? And every morning? I want you to do your morning pages?"" It was VERY difficult to listen to and I don't recommend it for that reason. Now I believe the SAME tape is offered through Amazon.com read by Natalie Goldberg--THAT might be a good bet, but the tape by the author leaves a lot to be desired."
5,This is a genuine classic. No exaggeration!,"I have found this book enormously helpful for connecting with my creative self, as well as my deepest feelings and longings. It is practical as well as wise. Granted, it is not easy at all to find the time to write three pages every day. This book was written before the addiction to the screen (iPhone, iPad, computer, facebook, etc.) took hold of us all. For me it has seemed like an eternity to sit and focus on one thing, writing longhand (longhand! can you imagine?!!) on nothing at all in particular. I guess that is just as much an argument for doing it as for not doing it, right? Whatever the case, it does what it promises to do: get the creative juices going. Which of us would not benefit from that?"
4,A good workbook,"If you are prepared to put in the time and do the work, this book is worthwhile. It gives you clear guidelines to follow, which makes the process that much easier. However, you do need to commit to the process if you want to get the best from it. I enjoyed the process, and will return to it in the future."
3,Time-Consuming,"I was initially inspired and as excited as all the other reviewers below, and even found that my creative juices were flowing once again.Unfortunately, it just took up too much of my time. The morning pages alone usually took me almost an hour to write (maybe I needed a larger ruled notebook?) It's all great if you're a professional freelance writer, but tougher if you're in the more likely situation of needing to hold down your 9-5 (or 9-7).I found that the exercises cut into the already sparse time I had left in my week to concentrate on my music. My morning pages were full of discovery, but I had little time left to take care of my art or my body (even Ms. Cameron advises to stay healthy).It's all wonderful stuff, but just doesn't take real world time constraints into account. Be ready for that."
5,Kudos to Cameron,"A challenging, but ultimately very rewarding exploration of one's creativity. I cannot recommend this book enough."
1,Not as good as you might think,"I bought this book following the advise on these pages. But as soon as I started reading it, I perceived that it wasn't the thing I thought it would be.For example, from the first very pages, the author starts dealing with the notion of God. What can an atheist like myself feel with that? Evidently the book has a perspective that I don't share: Why do you have to believe in the existence of ""creative forces"" in a trascendental way?It might work for certain people. For others, it may feel like a problem rather than a solution."
1,worthless new age drivel,"This book is typical of the self-help genre. It's long on feel-good pop psychology and very short on real advice. The author's main advice is to write the ""morning pages"" which is nothing more than two full pages of random thoughts every morning. I see that she now sells a blank ""workbook"" to help you do that in case you aren't creative enough to buy a notebook. The morning pages might be an okay idea but she doesn't really go beyond that.As for the author, she claims she can help you get unblocked if you're a writer but she only lists one real writing credit, a screenplay for a movie that no one has heard of..."
5,it almost new.,"I like it, i get it a good price and it looks like a new one, and I got it very soon, pretty good!"
3,"live to read, read to live","Hello!I am not finished yet reading the book The Artist's Way, but I already found out thatthe recommendations and lines given in the workshop to de-block helped me a lot tostart again with a new poem. However, it is not only the reading of that book thathelps. Walking in nature and claming your inner voice is very important.Regards,Astrid Dewancker"
4,I liked it so much I read it twice,"I must have felt a bit creative when i picked up this book because it is not the kind I normally look for in a book store. Once I started reading however, I was hooked. I liked the fact that the Morning Pages was at the begining of the book, which I immediately started to practice. You do not know relief untill you write three pages of any and everything that is on your mind in the morning. I was worried that I would not stick to it but, I can say that I am now addicted and look forward to writing every morning. That is the immediate reason I was drawn back in. If I got this much value from a single thing out out of this book, imagine what you would get. I can confidently recommend it."
5,Enormously helpful,"This book is amazing! It's full of ways to get not only your creative ideas in order, but also your life. Get it. Now."
4,Good.,"Julia Cameron's Artist's Way is a classic book. It is better than many humanistic psychology texts, simply becauseof the significant changes it brings into your life. Also, Julia is a poet, so just reading her nonfiction prosemakes you feel better.I have not done all the exercises Julia suggests in her book, but I have done the morning pages and the time to myselfexercises (What Julia calls Artist Dates). Do not leave your journal writing lying around. Look at it and then rip it up,even though Julia might not agree."
5,The Artist's Way,"Excellent exercises to stimulate creativity, clear subtle blocks and live a centered life. This is a reference book in my library. Periodically, I take myself through the book, revealing deeper treasures within. I recommend this book wholeheartedly.[...]"
2,Twelve-step lingo is a turnoff,"I find this book disappointing because it's steeped in Recovery/AA/12-Step vocabulary. Personally I find 12-stepping a turn-off, and so this book doesn't do it for me. I can see how it might help other people who might have less confidence in their abilities and pay too much attention to what authority figures or friends or family say to them. And I do think that writing a journal, whether it's a morning book or something geared more to your own circadian rhythms, is not a bad idea to loosen the creative flow. But as a writer, I found more useful stuff to try out in Natalie Goldberg's books."
3,Helpful..,The artist way is a spiritual approach that guides you to tapping into the Artist within. The material is creative and intuitive. Good job!
5,The Gift Of Julia,Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity introduced me back to myself and changed my life. It is a journey for anyone interested in personal insight and individual growth that will have a lasting effect on how you live and embrace your life. I am very grateful to a friend for recommending it to me.The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity [10th Anniversary Edition]
5,For your creative side!!,"Whether you have neglected your creative side or not, this guided journal will be helpful and fullfilling. It guides your path and has great ideas. You will be changed. Very worthwhile reading.Get in touch with things that have color and fragerance, texture, and sound. Give your senses a vacation. You will love the mood it creates.Dr. Kathy Seifert, Author ofRelax...Your Life Depends on It: a Journey of Discovery with the Wise Old Woman"
4,Insightful book -- best when done with a small group,"My group of three is just completing The Artist's Way and it's interesting to note that we are all taking away something different from the experience. A dying marriage has been resurrected, career clarity came to another, and I'm simply feeling empowered to be WHOLE/HOLY. Although we just spent three months on the process, I plan to start over again immediately by myself, taking time to complete every task. If you're looking for direction and are WILLING TO WORK at it (no pat answers here...) this is the book for you."
5,This book will Change Your LIFE!!!,"I was skeptical of what this book may do for me when I began, however, I am in week 5 and it has been Life Changing! If you truly follow the tasks and are honest with yourself in your ""morning pages"" then everything in your life will begin to fall in place. It won't be as easy journey, there are definitely ups and downs, good weeks ans bad, but if you just keep on going, it will change you as a person. I recommend this book to everyone willing to open their mind and take a chance at life...GOOD LUCK! You will not regret this one. Remember though, you will get out of it what you put in to it. Take the journey and prepare to be amazed at the bittersweet moments that will fill your new life and the NEW YOU!! :)"
4,Worth the Work,"I have yet to make it through this book after a couple of years of trying, but it is well worth the effort to get your inner artist unblocked. Even unfinished it has helped me make great creative strides. Worth the investment. Worth the work."
5,"if you don't want change in your life, avoid this book","Loosely based on a 12-step program, Cameron's 12-week workbook program for unleashing creativity is a dynamic tool for life change, whether the participant-reader is in THE ""change of life"" or A change of life. Each week's work includes beautifully written, thought-provoking text, as well as a series of exercises to bring home the point of the week's ""lesson."" Cameron designed the program for blocked artists, but anyone who will take the time to follow her text and work through a sampling of the weekly tasks will benefit, even those who protest they are not ""creative."" Without writing a poem or painting a canvas--or any of the other activities commonly considered creative--we are nonetheless the creators of our own lives. Anyone determined to avoid change should, at all cost, avoid this book."
5,An Amazing experience,"I cannot find enough adjectives to describe my experience with this book. I have been writing the morning pages for three weeks and have had an amazing experience. After not writing anything for a year and a half, I have been freed to write several songs and begin a book. The exercises have taken me on both a spiritual and psychological journey. Truly life changing."
5,Still Creating,"I found this book several years ago and recommended it to a friend, a struggling artist who couldn't seem to find the color yellow. She got to chapter eight before the elusive color found her, and she went on to create beautiful murals and ceilings for celebreties and football players(Jim Kelly, for one.) She got sick, and asked me if I knew who she could speak to, as Doctors didn't seem to know what was wrong. I suggested a woman I had heard of through the grapevine, but P.K. never got to see her. My lesson was that I had known of the book, and of the woman for years, but never thought about others being interested, or of helping them find it. This book is for anyone who wants to get in touch with the the divine gift of creativity in any form. P.K., I have learned. And for those who want to know who the woman was who probably would have saved P.K.'s life, read, ""Forget The Cures, Find The Case,"" by Rayna Gangi"
3,Getting Connected,"I cannot give a complete review due to the fact that I have not read the book all the way through yet. I first began reading this book in 1993 as part of a course I took in college. I felt something strong towards it almost from the very beginning, but did not complete the reading or the morning pages.Due to many changes I have experienced in my life lately I decided to pick up the book again. I think the book is great, but I have not gotten to the great stuff yet, if that makes sense. I am about half way through the book, I am doing the morning pages, have not started the artist dates yet, but I have some questions and would like to know if there is an email address to contact the author.Sincerely,Dawn Dewar"
1,Filled with deception and leads into demonic involvement.,"Extremely Pagan and New Age. Extremely offensive to those who are Born again Christian who are NOT Religious - like me. The ""spiritual path"" leads onto the darkness of deception, The ""Great Creator"" is some false god not Jehovah who created the universe.I recommend :Drawing on the Right Side of the Brainby Betty EdwardsThere's no pagan mumbo jumbo stuff in it."
4,recommended for your first time around,"If this is your first time going through the Artists Way program, then I would recommend using this workbook. Each chapter has a little synopses of what is in the book for that week. There are an exact number of pages needed for each week which is helpful to stay on track and make sure you write enough each day/week."
1,A real waste of time,Amazing how bad so many old Hollywood veterans can be when they have a rotten script and lame directing. Everyone involved in this mess should feel ashamed. One of the worst movies ever. Any wonder used copies sell for one penny?
2,Cooli-oolio!,"Oh dear. Another previews-in-16:9, feature-in-letterbox release. Fitzy (Peter Falk), his crazy crossed-eye, and his four buddies (Rip Torn, George Segal, Bill Cobbs, Billy Burke) make a cross-country road trip, from Florida to Las Vegas, in order to stop his daughter Elizabeth from marrying some French dude. She's only known him 3 months, and is marrying him for citizenship. Turns out he's a ""gerbiler."" I won't explain. Anyway, the guys charter a private bus with their gay driver Antoine, who they wind up ditching with his lover Chris, after they discover them in a compromising position. Antoine and Chris go all Thelma & Louise, and Fitzy & gang are wanted for the disappearance of the bus driver. If you're into golf and/or rap, maybe you'd enjoy this more than I did."
4,Actually Pretty Good,"I bought this film because I'm on a Billy Burke kick and I had to have it. It turned out to be really funny and kind of cute. I was pleasantly surprised. Even my husband liked it. A bunch of spunky old guys and a slacker 30-something headed to Vegas with the police in tow, what's not to like?"
1,Boring/Not a real Workout,"If you're a beginner or very overweight and don't want to just do walking workouts, this might be something to try. However, it's super boring, very easy (step guide definitely not needed), slow and without sweat."
3,Great for beginners or easy day for non-dancers,"This dvd is definitely geared for the beginner. The moves are done at 1/2 pace & are a bit modified or vanilla so they are easy to follow. Half of the dance portion is mixed jazzy/common moves & half latin. The latin seemed at least was somewhat normal speed since real latin dancing is VERY fast. The last 10 min is a mat reclined common ab exercises.Those of you who have any dance training, decent natural talent, or have several dance workout dvds will find this too easy & mediocre. Those who workout more then once a week on average will find the pace too easy unless for a light day. All others who feel they have two left feet, are new to dance workouts or fitness will love this.You can see a preview on collagevideo, totalfitnessdvds & youtube."
3,Not my thing,"I love Marie Forleo, but I guess the Dance thing just doesn't work for me. I love jazz dance and ballroom dance, but dancing in front of the tv just doesn't work for me, I feel silly. I have no problem with just cardio routines, but the dance party thing did not turn out the way I hoped. My idea was to have a fun workout on days when I didn't want to get the weights out, but I'd rather use my other dvds."
3,"Tummy Tone Party Zone--a little sculpting, not aerobic","This one doesn't show Marie at her best; she's demonstrating the moves with other women who've done their own videos, like Michelle and Stella, and she seems a little ill at ease. I don't think the workout is strenuous enough to provide much benefit for most exercisers either."
1,Overuses of one word!,"Dance Off the Inches: Tummy Tone Party ZoneI got really tired of the word ""funky."" I hope she can expand her vocabulary to match her ability to dance."
5,Dance off the inches: Tummy Tone Party Zone!,This dvd is a great workout AND its FUN! I definitely recommend this for anyone who finds it hard to keep motivated with all those boring workouts and annoying trainers. I don't foresee this ever to be boring or anything but fun and leaving you with loads of energy.
1,Tummy Tone,This product took longer than the estimated time to arrive. It seemed fun when I poped it into the DVD player. I really enjoyed doing the moves for 5 min. Then the DVD began skipping. I skipped through the jumping areas then it froze. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase!
3,Fun but not challenging,"Recently, I bought this DVD. Most evenings, I work out to a Tae Bo DVD four or five times a week. I thought I'd give this one a try for the other nights. Although it was fun to dance, I didn't find the workout challenging enough for me. I didn't really break a sweat. This DVD seems to be geared more towards beginners."
3,"Written for teenagers, not for adults",Not much new information can be found in this book you can't currently find on the internet.
4,Suunto compass,Quality compass and once use to it works very well. The instuction sheet is useless. Takes a couple of trips to the field to get used to the rotation depending on style of compass you currently use. Mapping tools are Ok but do not replace grid cards for detail work.
1,Horrendous Quality Control,"The concept of integrating DirecTV twin tuners with digital recording capabilities is brilliant, and the user friendliness of these machines is quite good considering the sophisticated technology. But I've only been able to experience it for about six hours before the units fail. Hard drives malfunction, tuners go out; I'm waiting for my third unit. My father has had three bad Philips DSR 7000 before giving up & buying a Hughes unit that has functioned for some time now. The warranty is terrible; 90 days and you have to pay the shipping. Philips should not have put their name on these machines, which all appear identical (RCA, Hughes, Philips) from the same joynt mfr. in Mexico. Mine came from the Philips Employee Store & I'm loyal, but this is pathetic."
1,Huh?,"I also got ""Worship Under the Stars"" - religious concert in Georgia instead of ""Lubbock Lights."" This goes beyond being disappointing."
1,Wasted my $$$,"I am not a resident or native of Lubbock but I have always liked the area. I bought this DVD thinking for the rather high price I had to pay for a no name DVD it would actually show something about Lubbock and some of the truly good and successful musicians that have come from that area. Instead it appears to be made by the High School Senior Class' drama department and has only two references to people I have ever heard of (besides Stubb's). A three word dedication to Waylon (no more) and a statement that Buddy Holly was not as important to Lubbock music as this other Kinky Freedman wanna be that I have never heard of! Who are these people?? At least the price has come down since I bought my copy. No wonder! Look for my once used copy of ""Lubbock's Lightweights"" when I list it. It will be ""bargain"" priced!"
4,Great Book For The Real Estate Novice,"This book is well-written and I found it easy to understand. It is well-organized and contains loads of information essential to selling real estate in New York. The questions at the end of each chapter are in my opinion, more difficult than those on the state exam. Don't expect these same questions on your state test. Also, I purchased two other books to use as study guides for the state exam because this book doesn't quite fully prepare you, especially if some time has passed since you finished your course hours and when your state exam appointment is scheduled."
3,Handy guide,"This book is a nice, basic reference for fishing Lake Taneycomo. The layout is kind of confusing, but once you figure out that the maps and illustrations that are referenced in the text are located in the back half of the book, it becomes easier to figure out. There is no earth shattering revelations to be found here, just a lot of good, solid information presented in a basic and easy to understand manner. I enjoyed it and it will be part of my reference library for a long time!"
5,Solid Rock,"This is a great album featuring a best of format. Harry Vanda and George Young are of course extremely gifted musicians and this album typifies 80s style rock. The musicians history goes way back to the fabulous sixties and the Easy Beats. George Young is of course Angus and Malcolm's (of ACDC fame) older brother. Media man, Money Don't Lie, Down Amongst The Dead Men and the foot tapping Ayla are all great tracks which will keep any party going."
5,Down-To-Earth Advice,"In Publishing Without Borders, Michael Ross has skillfully managed to distil many years' experience of international publishing into a concise and highly practical manual which will prove immensely valuable to those whose publishing activities are taking on an international dimension.Alongside down-to-earth advice on a broad range of topics from the mechanics of deal making to the editorial considerations necessary to get books `right' for the co-edition market, he offers useful insights into the process - why is it worthwhile for publishers to acquire rights from other publishers? Why is the decision making process often so tortuous? Most importantly for me, he captures the essence of international publishing - long-term relationship building rather than short-term gain.I wish this book had been around when I was starting out!Roberta BaileyManaging DirectorArcturus School and Library Division"
5,Seasoned Veteran Shares Experience,"Michael Ross is an expert in International Licensing. In this book he gives you the benefit of decades of experience. It is clear. It is concise. It is filled with information upon which you can build new business from existing intellectual property. If you are already engaged in international licensing, find out if you can increase your share. If you have just started looking at the international market, benefit from the insights of this seasoned veteran.Bill EvansPresidentEvan-Moor Educational Publishers"
3,Pretty good book,"This was a good book, but I don't think it was as good as the other Steen books. There always seems to be something left out and questions that are still unanswered. But, it was OK."
1,"Small Strawbale: Natural Homes, Projects & Designs","I am extremely disappointed in this offering. There are few home designs offered, even though the title would suggest otherwise.The poorly photographed completed homes appear to belong hippie wannabes. A small home can just as easily project charm as a large one. These, however, seem to have been selected for reasons other than their ""good looks"". The unfortunate choices of dwellings can dissuade many curious, potential strawbale builders from considering this material. Selection of these offerings by the authors; homes, sheds and walls, would be valid only if they wanted to undermine the progress of strawbales being considered as worthwhile construction materials."
1,Interested in Straw Bale Homes? Buy a different book.,This book has a handful of straw bale homes that the vast majority of people would never want to live in. There is also no real technical or design information.It is basically a storybook of a few people that decided to embrace a very minimal lifestyle. It may work for a few that would have lived in a commune or co-op in the sixties.
2,Another coffee table book for the Eco-Chic crowd,"Smaller is good, when it comes to building homes. Showing readers that some people can live just fine with less, is good. However, there will be many people who will believe that this volume will provide instruction in building a proper long-lasting strawbale building, but they would be wrong. This book is really another pretty coffee table book for the Eco-chic crowd. It has lots of color pictures, however, in many of the pictures shown, they don't give me a feel for the shape or essence of the building. I would have liked to see for each house shown a more inclusive description of the entire building methods employed, including all materials used and foundation details.Maybe the subtitle should have been ""Natural Homes Ideas Book""."
1,Doesn't discuss conflicts with American values,"Islam is a triumphalist theocratic tradition. The American Constitution provides for a secular state where government and religion are separate. The Koran endorses wife beating which is illegal in the United State. The Koran also endorses polygamy, similarly illegal in the United States. Traditional Islam called for the separation of the sexes based on the hadith in which Mohammed states that ""when a man and a woman are alone together, the third person present is the Devil""Question, how can a believing Muslim agree to support the Constitution of the United States when the Islam requires theocracy. Question how can a believing Muslim live among non-believers who are considered unclean?Food for thought."
2,Wrong Book- Pretentious Signers,"There was nothing wrong with the book when I purchased it, except for I need the workbook on units 1-6, not just unit 1. However the actors who sign on the DVD really bothered me. This is supposed to be a level one ASL workbook, and they were signing rather quickly and this DVD did not come with the repeat option, as the larger workbook does. If you blink you miss something and have to start over completely. I understand that it is supposed to get you used to interacting with ""natural signers"", but it is too much to take in on your first day."
1,This book is outdated...,"This is outdated, difficult to follow and way too much money. If it wasn't required for my ASL class I wouldn't have wasted my money. I don't like it at all. I haven't found it helpful or useful, I rely on online sources or other books."
2,It's alright,"The book works when you're in a class that requires the book. The instructor will show how to sign the words and variations of it. However, on its own, the book will not work for self study. The words are not labelled, and the movements look a little confusing. In addition, the book is a little old so some signs have not been updated.Regardless, as long as you have someone to instruct you and you have the DVD (which I did not get because I did not know this order will not include the DVD), the book will be good for looking things up after you learned the words.As I just mentioned, my order did not include the DVD, which does not seem very bad, however there are a lot of activities that require you to use the DVD- almost every page says to look at the DVD, and since I don't have it, I'm not so sure what I'm missing."
4,Signing Naturally Workbook,"This is the book that was required for my beginner's to sign language class. I liked the layout of the book as it is categorized quite appropriately. It also has some history and other information regarding the deaf culture and ASL. But the only drawback is that this book is a lot older so there were many signs that already have evolved throughout the years. I'm just glad that my instructor was able to revise a few of the signs that were in the workbook. The video that also comes with this book would only be helpful if you have someone explaining to you what the characters in the video are signing because I would find it difficult to understand what they're saying since this is my first time learning sign language. But other than that, I liked the book a lot. It was helpful :-D"
3,SIGNING NATURALLY: STUDENT WORKBOOK LEVEL 1,"Carter C. Kemp explained this book in excellent detail. What he has written is EXACTLY RIGHT, because it is easy for students' to become confused and misunderstood by others. NOT GOOD IN THE NON HEARING COMMUNITY! I can't add any more information to his review. Otherwise, a good beginning sighing book in a CLASSROOM with an experienced educator."
1,signing naturally,"to me the book doesn't explain much....as well as the class....for beginning sign language, i thought it would be something that would explain things a little more as well as having the words to let you know just what it is that you are saying...I really didn't like the cd....i dropped the class because the teacher was just as bad as the book....maybe i will find someone who can give a little more clarity about sign language"
3,It's an okay book,I'd have liked more descriptive pictures since I can't access the DVD everyplace I take the book.
5,signing book,this item is great for my class this year. i saved money and love it. i will tell people about this.
2,MISSING CD,"I AM SO UPSET BECAUSE THE BOOK SHOULD HAVE CAME WITH THE CD BUT DID NOT. I DID NOT NOTICE IT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT BECAUSE I HAD RECEIVED MANY OTHER BOOKS AND OVERLOOKED IT. BUT TODAY I STARTED THE NEW SEMESTER AND MY INSTRUCTOR SAID TO MAKE SURE ANY BOOK ONE ORDERS SHOULD HAVE CD. I LOOKED AND IT WAS NOT IN THE BOOK. IN MY ORDER IT SAYS IT WAS INCLUDED, BUT WAS NOT. IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE CLASS STARTED AND I HAVE NO TIME TO SEND IT BACK AND TRY TO GET REFUND, TOO BAD."
3,A Little Out Of Date,The book is useful but the cultural info is a little out of date. It says not to tap someone's shoulder and now that is considered acceptable. I think it is a great supplement to ASL learning.
3,Who the hell produced this mess?,"Internal Suffering really caught my ear with the release of Choronzonic Force Domination. I was really looking forward to see how they would progress, and I must say that Awakening of the Rebel left me disapointed. The best way to describe this album is like this: Imagine Kataklym's album Sorcery, and then imagine it about 50 times faster. Awakening of the Rebel has almost ridiculous sounding drums - this guy NEVER stops blasting. The overall sound of the album also is a let-down, as it just seems rather hollow. The vocals style is also all over the place, and I just wish that they would have stuck with the low-end, brutal death metal style that was on their previous albums."
2,Dated and eccentric overview of aviation markings,"I would like to have called Aircraft Markings of the World, 1912-1967 by Bruce Robertson an esoteric work. Instead it is an collection of data on markings by country for the first 55 years of powered heavier than flight. Thus, it is dated which makes it content even more eccentric. An interesting read but of fvalue only to the modeler of period aircraft."
5,Great Shoes!!,"I bought these on a whim, and am very glad I did. They fit great, broke in quickly, and look as good as the picture. They even come with a spare pair of khaki colored laces for an alternate look. I paid $90 for 'em, and would gladly do it again!"
5,Excellent essays,"I purchased this book for the essay by Rita Nakashima Brock and Rebecca Ann Parker. I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Brock at a retreat in which her lectures focused on she and Parker's book ""Saving Paradise."" It was the most exciting lecture on Christian origins that I have heard in years-perhaps ever. The essay here fleshes out a comment of Dr. Brock's regarding the origin of John's gospel. The idea that it is a ""Samaritan"" gospel is a very interesting one which supports viewing John's anti-Judaism as having its origins in the division between Samaritans and Judeans. I have been unable to discover other exegetes who have given the idea consideration including the R.E. Brown magnum Opus for the Anchor Bible. I recommend Brock and Parker to anyone interested in a ""new"" perspective on the formation of the church and its scripture. ""Saving Paradise"", is also I think a must read.If others have additional references I would be interested in knowing them."
3,review of the Suuto Arrow,"Has a good response time, points correctly. The major problem to an otherwise fine compass is the black paint on the graticules wears very quickly making them hard to read."
4,It's a compass,"The name is what this is about ""Suunto"" and it does just whats it's supposed to do! It's for my dad who is into Orienteering and is one of the top rated in his class and age. This is his choice. He is 66 years old and needs the mag. in it.My family of 10 is the testing grounds and we give the real world exam!"
4,Book Of Poems,"Life's Journey is a collection of poetry that has a bit of everything. You will find a poetry for everything, and there is sure to be at least one poem you can relate to, from airplanes and alarm clocks, to special days and nature. Each poem is unique from each other but still bear the mark of the author. This rising poet has a cadence of his own, but once you find it you will love his poetry.Reviewed by Sara PriceAuthor of Sign of the Calla Lily and Rise of the Wizards."
5,Squishy Ball,"So much fun! Definitely not an educational toy, but a great stress reliever. Makes me giggle playing with it."
4,"A portrait of a young man, his family, his love","Grodstein's debut novel opens with a scene in which 28-year-old Joel's girlfriend Lisa is taking a pregnancy test. At first glance, the book appears to be about the upcoming life decisions Lisa and Joel (who aren't exactly excited about marriage) are going to have to make. Grodstein quickly whisks the reader away, however, into Joel's past, into the history of this man and the relationships that shaped him so that he arrived at this scene on a weekend afternoon fretting about pregnancy.As we learn about Joel's past, we're introduced to his parents, Bay and Stan, and to the amazing but permanently scarring Blair Carter. The more I read about the rich fabric from which Joel's being was woven, I hoped this book would not be about his upcoming parenthood with the unavailable, bland, broken-legged Lisa. I'll leave the reader to find out what it is about in their mind, but it was a quick and delicious read for me."
3,I was a New Yorker for a long time...,"but like a lot of NY-centered books, think a lot of flavor will be lost to non-NY'rs.Writing is OK but not terribly memorable. In fact I was about ready to put it down because of the constant narrative being interrupted with backstory. Learned to get over the device, but not the rather shallow characters. Could be the writer really wanted to ""get into the way a guy really thinks"""" and I am just too impatient with the character's maturity to become interested enough to really care.I got the book in one of the Amazon special-$5 deals and I don't regret it. I read A LOT and usually select from prize-winning books by running through Border's and picking up what I have listed from reviews and what I find on the shelves that seem likely to interest me. (almost everything, it seems.) Don't think I would have picked this up. Just too young for me, altho it did make me homesick for the daily life in the city."
3,"Well-written, just a downer",This author's writing style and characterization is well-done and enjoyable. My main complaint is that I thought the book would be more light-hearted than it was. About halfway through I started feeling bogged down and wishing it would just end for all of these slightly pathetic people.
5,Baby Boutique,"This is a Hooray for Amazon opinion. I searched everywhere for thisbook, I had one, but I loaned , can't remember to who?, Again a friendsaid , ""Try Amazon"" and there is was...I needed the book , my new great grandbabywas on the way and it is the best book in the world for making crib sheets, etc.Thank you , Amazon. The price was incredible, shipment was prompt. and I gotthe items made in time...Again, thank you Amazon"
5,Excellent for beginning college students,"Moody's conversation between 3 bright students is short (96 pages, 8 chapters), fair (no one ""wins""), comprehensive (most of the classic issues are present), provocative (a well-versed discussion leader should be delighted), accessible (almost none of the traditional jargon), and rigorous (the arguments, though brief, require careful attention). This is not a ""teach yourself"" book. Though any reasonably intelligent reader can profit from it, the careful treatment it deserves calls for guidance from someone knowledgeable in the philosophy of religion. The opportunities for such an instructor to segue from the book into additional topics are abundant and are aided by an excellent annotated reading list."
2,Characters aren't 'real',"Interesting, even thought provoking arguments--however, the dialogue between the characters is so one dimensional and flat that I was quickly turned off. People just don't talk this way. I couldn't get past the poor writing long enough to consider the subject matter."
4,"great for ""big picture""","I used this for my med school pharm class. After checking it out repeatedly from the library, I decided to buy it. I liked this more than the Lange pharm chart. If you like charts, this is a great book..very easy to read. I give it 4 stars because it's old (there hasn't been a new version in quite sometime) and also because it's a bit too general for med school class (our class covers much more detail, more drugs that may not be in this book, more effects/side-effects, etc, so i use this book as a starting point to make my own charts). Still, I love this book because it makes it easy to see patterns in a family of drugs. I'd recommend using another book for detail (I like Katzung's Pharmacology Exam & Board Review) and filling in this book as you take the class. I haven't taken boards yet but imagine this will be a good refresher for board prep."
5,great alternative to latex gloves,These gloves are comfortable and easy to put on and use. They are a great alternative to latex or vinyl disposable gloves.
5,A message of hope and forgiveness,"This is the autobiographical account of a woman's painful journey through the darkness of depression and the grief of rejecting her unborn child. It is only when she 'throws away her crutches' that she allows herself to find a deeper relationship with God. It is a tender and moving story told with a lightness of voice and a lack of self-pity that makes it a surprisingly easy book to read. It is a book that will appeal to so many people who are searching for meaning in their lives. It has particular resonance for anyone who has suffered an abortion, and for anyone who has suffered from depression. Finally, it is a tale of hope, reconciliation, forgiveness and peace. I recommend this book unreservedly."
1,Says its 1 hour and 15 minutes long. It's actually only 20 minutes.,"I have now downloaded this file twice. The first time, I thought I made a mistake or that something was wrong with my computer because when I burned it to a CD, it only lasted 20 minutes. However, after downloading the file a second time, on a different computer, I see that the file is still only 20 minutes long. The information says the track is 1 hour and 15 minutes long. Is it Amazon's fault or ""Ambient Sleep Tunes for Kids?"" I don't know."
3,"""...Turning 50"" Review","Great book, my friend loved it. The only issue was that it stated it was a hardcover edition, but what I recieved was a paperback version."
5,i love it,"this sholder holster is great,it is easy to set up,it feels good,&it WILL hold the judge.after you get it adjusted,take some tape & tape the ends of the straps down. the padded sholders are a very big plus."
3,Blast from the past!,"WOW--haven't heard this since I lost the album decades ago; does anyone remember how the dial of a phone sounded? Well. Buy this CD and you won't be disappointed. The second half is quite dated, but Imus was a funny guy in the day, and not the exceptionally unhappy jerk he seems to be now."
5,Dare me to the Desert,"We have the original hardback of this book. Murray is a real character. Alpine Club member. RGS Award, etc.His stories are inspirational and have taken us to remote parts of Egypt to find mountains he visited, Gebel Sila'i, the Rock Bridge of the Farayids, Jebel Shayib etc. For anyone interested in desert travel, desert people and mountains it's a great read. Fully recommended."
5,This music makes me smile.,"I had this CD years ago and lost it, when I saw it on Amazon I grabbed it. This music is performed with such passion and I love the instruments."
4,Good balance of moisturizers,"Combination skin still needs moisturizers. This provides a great balance of moisturizers without leaving any oily residue. Mary Kay foundation glides over the moisturizer very smoothly, and you can even use less foundation because it doesn't soak into your dry skin."
2,A Mary Kay disappointment,"Do not like this new moisturizer; much preferred the one in the white bottle with pink lid. When I use this moisturizer, ten minutes later my face feels dry and tight. Put more on, in about half an hour my face feels dry and tight, etc. Cannot keep apply the stuff all day long. Will not order again."
4,"just what I expected, and fast!","The product arrived within 4 days and was exactly as it was advertised and what I expected. simple, easy and fast"
3,Extra material,"While anything with Dolphy is worth having in my opinion, this CD contains a couple of extra songs that were left off the Live at the Five Spot sessions. The rhythm section is very prominent in the 2 longs songs. CD only about 30 to 35 minutes. Would have been much better if these were packaged with one of the original CDs, which weren't overly song."
3,A bit of history,"I had the privilege of seeing Artur Rubinstien play Chopin at Fairfield Halls in Croydon, England, at about the time of the Moscow concert - an experience I shall never forget. As you can imagine, I was looking forward to seeing and hearing the Moscow concert. Visually, it was difficult to fault, given the level of technology at the time and the actual recital looked as good, if not better than I had hoped, although the encore section of the DVD was not as good. The audio was, unfortunately, variable and overall not very good and only gave glimpses of the superb variations in tone and mood that Rubinstein was capable of. Again, the actual recital was much better than the encore section. Overall, I was delighted to be reminded in such a vivid way of the superb virtuosity of Artur Rubinstein and I am very glad to have bought the DVD."
4,nice but short,"This shirt is verry cute, just too short for my taste. The length goes just above my hips and I like my shirts a bit longer. I didn't find that the shirt ran small, The medium fit me just as good as any other medium."
2,Not as I remembered,"I used to think that this game was terrific ... I purchased it for my kids, thinking that they'd love it. But they haven't thought much of it. So, it's a tough call whether someone will enjoy it or not."
4,"Heavy, but beautiful and accurate",What a beautiful watch. It's a bit heavier than the non-auto-winding type but so far is keeping perfect time! The styling is classic. The clasp is easy to adjust.
1,"A horibble watch, it goes 1 - 2 minutes faster a day!","I purchased this watch for my wife as a gift. It looks pretty nice and beautiful. However, its accuracy is bad. My wife wears it for only three days, it runs 5 minutes faster! What a hell this watch is! I have returned it to Amazon. Don't buy this watch."
1,Terrible watch,"I bought this watch 2 years ago. This is the worst watch ever! It stops sometimes for no reason. When it does work, it goes about 2-3minutes slower everyday! I have to adjust it every other day to keep up! The calendar function is a hit or miss as well. Do not buy it."
4,very good price for $19.99 a pair of shoe,"this is very good working shoes but only have have my brother size 7 1/2,too bad not my size 9 1/2."
4,perro e rancho,estos zapatos son mas fieles ke perro e rancho se los recomiendo.. son medio federikos pero son mas duraderos ke el carajo
3,The good and the bad,"The bad guy is played wisely by a good actor; the good is played by an imitation of an actor. I don't think the capture of Eichmann in '61 was a party. Howard plays like it was one. Could have been Dean Martin instead, result would have been the same. Otherwise, interesting tv movie. Not more than that."
1,booooring,"The story ofthe capture of Eichmann, is extremely simple. It can be described in 2 sentences. And that happens to be the content of the movie. So to fill an hour and a half the director had to fluff up the movie with very very very long conversations. After a while these conversations get so boring that you can't help pressing the fast forward button. Which brings you right to the end of the movie."
5,Clarins Extra Comfort Cleansing Cream 200ml/7oz,Been using this product for years and love it! Amazing smelling cleasing cream and makes my face feel extremely clean - I use it twice daily!
5,SOOTHING TO THE SOUL,I THOUGHT I HAD ALREADY WRITTEN MY REVIEW BUT EVIDENTLY NOT..I PURCHASED THE CD AND LISTENED TO IT AND FOUND IT TO BE VERY SOOTHING TO THE SOUL.YOU WON'T GO WRONG BY PURCHASING THIS CD NOR ANY MUSIC BY THE LATE JIM REEVES..I HAVE LISTENED TO IT DURING THE DAY BUT ALSO AT NIGHT..I RECOMMEND THIS CD...
4,Almost As Good As It Gets,"The recording is excellent. Many of the songs I have heard before but there are some good ones that I haven't. I would recommend this to any Jim Reeves fan. I rated it 4 stars because I have the ""Essential Jim Reeves"" and I feel it deserves the 5 stars. This one isn't quite as good."
5,A Gospel Great,"This is a wonderful CD. If you want a soft, pleasant voice with beautiful gospel songs that you will actually know the word too, then this is it. Classic."
3,"Well, it's not plastic","At least it's all metal. The hilt is poorly crafted in every aspect. The only good thing was that mine happened to have a straight and balanced blade, which was remarkable considering it was glued in place. I put it on my wall just the same. The engraving is kind of nice."
4,seems fine,"Husband is using it and it seems just fine. He has had one like it--or the same--for 20+ years, and it was gross (!). Was happy to find this replacement. :-)"
4,cute wallet great price,Got this for my son (4). Can't beat it for the price. Actually looks better than I expected. I don't know how well it would hold up for am adult who would need to carry a more full wallet but for a kid with a few dollars and maybe a gift card this will be great.
2,no container for coins,"This is a nice wallet but there is no container for coins - that is, the ""wallet"" is completely open so only suitable for notes. I would have expected (and wanted) a zipper so that coins could be carried too, especially since it seems to be for kids. It should make that clear."
2,Dollar bill compartment lacking,"This was a replacement for a nylon wallet that I had had for over a decade, and that was a hand-me-down from my brother. These things are very durable.What I don't like about this wallet is that the dollar bill compartment is secured only on two sides, the right and the bottom sides. If I had know this I wouldn't have bought this wallet. I have since glued the left side to make the compartment more secure. I need the sides secure, because I keep papers and receipts on both sides of the compartment.On the plus side, the compartment behind the right vertical pocket has a velcro enclosure, allowing me to securely put change or keys in there. I did not have this feature on my last wallet."
5,Perfect wallet for a 10 year old,"This was part of a Christmas present for my 10 year old grandson. It was perfect! He loved the camouflage and, of course, the money contained inside. The wallet was well made and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas."
5,Camouflage Nylon Commando Wallet,"I bought this wallet from Amazon.com10630 CAMOUFLAGE NYLON COMMANDO WALLETfor my boyfriend for Christmas he likes camouflage items, It was easy to order and arrived quickly. It was exactly like the picture showed, and my boyfriend likes that it has compartments for his credit cards and things, and easy access to get to your money. He also likes the fact that it's nylon and not leather, and it fits comfortably in his pants pocket. It was a good purchase at a reasonable price."
5,My Son secret,"My son loves his wallet, it is just what a young boy needs. the quality is good and it looks good too. Perfect for a boy first wallet"
3,Rothco wallet. Very basic product.,"OK, but I'm not impressed. Just a basic, cheap-looking wallet. I'm not even using it, since it does not not have enough pockets/slots for my credit cards."
5,Great book,"I'm a fairly new programmer in vb.net(finished vb.net II) and I found this book to be VERY good. Yes it is very theory intensive but the examples it gives are fairly straight forward and if you aren't the world's best programmer they show you how to make controls to make some really slick looking programs.There are a few .net 1.0 examples that will not work in the new 1.1 (notably the xp theme visualizations) but this book is well worth it if you are interested in making some ""professional"" looking forms for your application."
1,Horrible transfer.,"I got teary eyed watching this one. No, it wasn't because of the story line. Rather the transfer was abominable."
1,Not a good product,This product could not be downloaded on any of my computers. I am very unhappy with it. I just purchasedsomething that I cannot not use. I will never purchase any CD's or DVD's again.The talking dictionary is inoperable. i would not recommend it to anyone. It is useless.
2,I received The American Heritage Talking Dictionary !2/3/10.It was no good.,"I got a used copy of The American Heritage Talking Dictionary from bearyniceday.They said the copy was in good condition. I tried to install it in my computer and it NEVER worked. I am returning it to bearyniceday,for another copy."
2,Don't buy this one! Very bad software!,"I bought this software after I read the review from Geoff Walker. The product is nothing like he said. I could't even find some commonly use words. And, I have to put the CD to make it run . In Geoff's review, he recommanded us to use virtual CD but I could't find the free one , it will cost us more than $30 to buy that software .There is one talking dictionary from Merriam-Webster and which is far better than this one."
3,I followed the advice of other reviewers,Please withdraw my review submitted last week with the above title and do not substitute this one. Thank you.
5,Great for the Visual Learner.,"A great resource for a unit on Native Americans. 32 pgs of coloring sheets with captions that teach about each picture. Covers homes, people, occupations, clothing, food, transportation, and their crafts. This resource can be used in a classroom or in a multi-level homeschool setting with children in PreK-5th+"
1,Horrible,"This book is the worst. The drawings are so POORLY detailed you cant make out the pattern. Dont waste your money, get either McCain's or Metz's glass books. This is a really, really poorly done book, I would rate this a negative 10 stars!"
3,Adapter Cable,"This cable CSTD-01 will not fit your BlackBerry or Apple iphone. You need the GSM-ADP-CBB01 that has the 3.5mm plug that will fit the Apple iphone and the BlackBerry. I found mine at CDW Direct. [...] It cost me $53.99 plus shipping, over half as much as the cc550 headset cost. I could not locate this cable anywhere else for a cheeper price. Way to much for just a adapter cable."
2,This product ignores RJ 11 connectivity standards,"I have a Sennheiser binaural headset model SH 250. Finding a RJ11 adapter for it is a nightmare. In order to keep a captive market for their expensive bottom cables, Sennheiser has customized its connecting gables for specific makes of phones. You never know in advance if the cable is going to work with your phones unless you query the Sennheiser website to determine the proper cable. Do not buy these cables thinking that the appearance of the RJ11 plug assures usability. I am fed up running around looking for the right cable for the right phone. They need to go back to the standard RJ11 and its wiring. I am returning my Sennheiser headset to R&J; Computer, who is totally cluelessSennheiser SH250 Binaural Headset with Microphoneabout at they are selling."
1,Buyer Beware,"This album does not contain the original recordings but music from a live performance. The actual title of this album is ""Memory Lane"" not ""Memory Land."""
4,live Fats in stereo,"Amazon samples suggest to this Reviewer that we are listening to a late '70s era Fats concert.No surprises here, as to repertoire and arrangements. But let's call it, *pleasant* no surprises, as the ol' cliche goes. Fats and his band are affably tuned up with solid senders of ""My Girl Josephine"", ""Jambalaya (On The Bayou) and several others.Another set that Fats and fans can be proud of."
5,Who needs sopranos when you've got these guys?,"Jonas Kaufmann may not be a household name yet, but if he keeps this up, he will be soon. This is an incredible album that every Strauss lover and many of the unconverted need to hear. Gorgeous singing, with extraordinarily sensitive accompaniment from Deutsch. They work here as truly collaborative partners. A match made in heaven, to borrow a cliché.Listen to their ""Morgen!"" and you may never need to hear a soprano or the orchestrated version of that lied again!"
1,unbelieveably bad,"Anyone who raves about this awful CD has no taste or knowledge of lieder. All Kaufmann does is belt out these songs with no sense of feeling or sensitivity whatsoever. The first track will show what I mean. Definitely ""can belto."" This CD wasn't released, it escaped."
1,Not quite what I expected,Not quite what I expected really. this was kinda disappointing I think the description of the item didn't match what I got.
2,reliable but the audio is very muffled,"It triggers reliably and survived a few small tumbles, but unfortunately, the audio is very muffled: the high frequencies are missing, so many words can't be understood. I have very good hearing, too. Pushbuttons are just a little dodgy, but not too bad. This thing would be worth twice the price if they could just sharpen the audio a bit."
2,recoding quality is low,I was dissapointed in the sound quality of the recording. It is in places hard to understand all the words. I assumed it would be clear and easy to understand.The nightlight feature (motion detects the light) is not practical -- the light isn't enough to be useful.
5,The Railroaders,"This is one of the finest books written on the people who worked for the American and Canadian railroads during the golden era of that industry. The text goes beyond the usual ""fan"" type material, and the photographs by Lawson Little are excellent portraits of these wonderful people. It is an excellent departure from the usual fare available that dwells on locomotives and track plans!!"
3,Didn't Like it,"What can I say: I didn't like it and returned it. It had a poor finish - very sharp, unfinished edges. Stick with Crown products. Better quality than Footprint and the same price."
3,"File under ""eclectic""","Okay, warning, this thing is just plain weird. It's an instrumental album, jangly folk type music, with a dozen (or so) Japanese musicians lead by one Rocket Matsu, playing about a thousand instruments, ranging from horns to string instruments, whistle pipes, bells, synths, saws, squeeze boxes, and all manner of various things being beat upon. Sometimes it sounds like Men Without Hats and sometimes it sounds like a Three Stooges soundtrack. Some of it is listenable and some (like the title track, half McCarthur's Park and half noise) just isn't at all. I don't know how you rate something like this, or even how you classify it. Make up your own mind, but do not expect it to sound rational. This is their third CD. Jeez, you have to wonder what the first two sounded like.By the way, Amazon, the name of the album is ""Dodesukaden"", not ""er""."
5,"Beautiful, funny, sad and RIVETING!","I loved this book. The writing is smart and gorgeous. The storytelling is equal parts sad, funny, insightful, and surprising. I was inspired by this book and also riveted. In it we get the story not only of Elena--the daring, hilarious, kind-hearted Peace Corps worker--but also that of the many women Elena came to know during her years in Guatemala. It's a bold approach, to tell the story of women so different from her, but it works wonderfully and I was as deeply engaged with each of these women as I was with Elena herself. I found myself thinking about each of these women in the hours throughout the day when I wasn't reading their stories, anxious to get back to the book to see what happened next. I highly recommend When I Was Elena."
5,Unforgettable!,"This is one of those books whose characters you can't stop thinking about. Ellen Urbani masterfully weaves her own story with some of the most amazing women I've ever had the privilege of reading about. Long after I closed the book, the images and voices of all these women, stayed with me and inevitably, changed me."
4,Great stories from a brave Peace Corps worker,"I thought this was a very interesting book, full of funny, poignant, and scary stories of a beautiful young woman trying to make a difference in a foreign country at war. She could have taken a number of approaches to sharing her stories. I liked that she chose her relationships with the women she met and telling the stories from her own and from their perspectives. Very clever approach. Her perspective as an older adult looking back at her youthful adventures held good wisdom. I highly recommend it."
1,A Book of Mis-Shappened Facts,"Written by what appears to be an older Independent Baptist, there is nothing but distortion and foolish in this work. I do not know where the author received a doctorate, perhaps at a mail order or perhaps at Bob Jones U.However, if you want to know what the author believes read it, the arguments can each be turned to the true Light and you can see it for what it is."
3,"Same DVD, Different",Its the same matches as the ones on Best of CM Punk in FIPScene IndexBefore They Were Wrestling Stars: CM Punk3. CM Punk Vs. Vordell Walker [18:50]4. Highlights: AJ Styles Vs. Homicide [3:08]5. Homicide Vs. Joshua Masters w/ CM Punk [3:01]6. CM Punk Vs. Justin Credible [13:44]7. Cm Punk Vs. Rainman [18:36]8. CM Punk Vs. Homicide [14:02]9. Highlights: Azrieal w/ CM Punk Vs.

2,bummer,"To start off I am a big CM Punk fan. I have been living the straight edge life style before it was even called that. So I instantly got hooked on him. When I saw this dvd I was thrilled. But after seeing it I was disappointed, the matches were ok but just not what I was expecting."
4,Great introduction to cetology!,"I first recieved this book for X-mas in the early 80's. I was 10 and in love with whales (I still am). Great book with many details of all the species. The paintings/illustrations are very good, although may be out of date in portraying the true profile of whales.I've the 1st edition hardback (1982) and since that time the knowledge has greatly grown about whales. However; Ellis goes into great detail with the historic (whaling era)/ scietific literature of the day.For what it's worth - this is a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in whales. There is also the Book of Dolphins and Porpoises which is equally as fine as the Book of Whales."
4,Children of older ages,"As far as the content of the book goes, it unfortunately is not appropriate for small children and there are limited pictures of whales. As a matter of fact there are no photographs of whales at all, only drawings. I was not aware of this at the time of purchase. I am sure the content will be more interesting when said child grows old enough to enjoy the numerous pages of information about various whales, I only hope he is still interested in them. The drawings are beautiful and descriptive though."
5,Totally Enjoyable,"This is one of a series of books from the ""Consumer Guide."" But it is not a consumer guide in any sense of the word.It is, instead, a loving tribute to American cars. The authors start with a historical sketch of the entire decade, and then write one chapter for each year of the decade. Within the chapter, all American automakers have a major section, with breakdowns for individual makes. So, for example, General Motors has a major section, then a subsection for Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and other marques.You have to wonder where they got the pictures. There are vivid, period-evoking pictures and art, much in full color, which bring the era's hope and promise back to life for the reader. You can spend hours leafing through this, enjoying a trip back in time...But also enjoying the hype and hope. American automakers promised us success, sex, power and happiness with every ad, every line, every rev. It's great fun to experience this again..."
1,Belt pully problem.,Harbor freight is well aware of this problem. If you want a new belt don't order one...go for a few dozen. The fix is that one of the pulleys has a sharp edge on it and cuts the belt. Notice they are always torn on the diagonal when they break. I have heard Harbor will fix it or come up with a new machine for you with the right alignment. Good LuckJerry
1,Belt brakes,I bought mine directly from Harbor freight and the belt broke within 24 hours. I exchanged it and got another that lasted for 18 hours. I'm going to try and locate a replacement through a regular industrial supplier.
5,Your best backcontry companion!,"Even with some professional first aid training under my belt, this book gave me the confidence to trust in my abilities (in all types of situations). A must have on any backcountry trip!"
3,Too much for my needs,"I bought this book expecting it to be the book I'd take with me into the wilderness. It proved to be more (or maybe less) than what I needed.The book probably has much of the first aid advice that users of wild places need, but I found its content to be overwhelming and not well suited to my particular requirements. If you're looking for a medical guide to carry with you, A Comprehensive Guide to Wilderness & Travel Medicine (Adventure Medical Kits) might be a better choice."
1,ZZzzzzzZZZZZZzzzzZZZZzzzz,"Quite possibly THE most boring book ever written. I love history, particularly the middle ages, but this book droned on about topics for up to thirty pages that easily could have been summed up in a page or two. This book is terrible, do not buy it - especially if you are a teacher - Forcing someone to read this book is cruel and unusual punishment."
4,Unique perspective on medieval history,"Ask history professors about medieval Europe and they will likely highlight its philosphical achievements and political and theogical conflict. Rarely will they talk about the technological achievements and their effects on society.This books fill in that gap. For anyone interested in technological history you will find this book very interesting. From the machinery of mills to advancements of building technology to the necessity for unions, this books shows how we are not all that unlike medieval Europe. It even speaks of events that we do not think about; i.e. medieval Europe was much warmer and drier then it is today. Medieval Europe was not technologically stagnant, but made many advancements that lead the way for modern advanced society. Great book!"
4,A great read for pre-teens (and adults too)!,"It's too bad that Michael Swartz wasn't writing about Neil Everheart when I was a youngster. I likely would have become an avid reader earlier in my life. Thankfully, I have referred my own pre-teens to this engaging mystery where Neil, Marcus and Jun are the teenage sleuths who foil bullies and bad guys in greater DC. Excellent character development, picture perfect description of Greenbelt and real life drama. I look forward to the next in the Everheart series."
4,Make sure to get the correct model!,"Received as gift for 4 yr old. The card reader didn't work, nor the touchkeys on the left after selecting the ""department"". Exchanged at national toy store and realized that they replaced it with a different model. There was no scanner/scale on the left, the touch keys on the left didn't work at all, and no light on the hand scanner, the worst was the drawer that wouldn't shut when the coins were placed inside. So once again, returned it and found the original register that she received, no problems now-and everthing fit within. It really is a great toy. The larger cards help with pictures until she can read. I can't imagine the register without the touchpad function on the left side. It also has a touch key for gift card, and a play key for the on/off. I'm surprised the other models are selling for the same price. I would have returned it if not having found their last model like the one received."
2,Disappointing design,"Although my daughter loves this toy, especially the microphone, I am disappointed with the quality. The ""locking"" cash drawer will not close at all when the change is inside and it is difficult to open when it is closed. I would not recommend this toy. I am considering returning it for a better designed cash register, if I can find one."
3,Nice Register,"My daughter loved this cash register, it has tons of cards to scan, savings cards, credit cards and money. Each card has a word and a picture until she is able to read the cards.I have two complaint, the coins gets stuck in the cash drawer. Secondly the register randomly gives you a price for an item and if you scan that same item again, it will give you another price for the exact same item."
3,angmomof3,"I got this for my daughter at christmas and before I got it I got an email from the company saying that they no longer carried this product there was a newer version, so i took the newer version plus a 10 dollar credit but it wasnt worth it at all. My daughter didnt even like the newer one and its not near as good as the one that was pictured, so needless to say I am going to have to purchase another one this year!!"
1,Design is flawed -- Drawer will not close with change inside,"I ordered this Barbie cash register for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. She immediately loved it and played with it for about 30 minutes. When she was cleaning up and putting everything back together, we noticed that the cash drawer would not close completely with the change inserted. I tried several ways to make it close but nothing worked other than removing the change. Everything else worked fine except for this. I did return it b/c in my opinion it was not functional. I only gave it one star b/c it is flawed and does not function properly. I do not recommend purchasing this product.Barbie ""Shopping Time"" Cash register"
5,Hahahahahahahaha!,"If you like Roz Chast, you will love this funny collection of her hilarious takes on parenting and childhood. It makes a great extra with a baby shower gift, too."
2,--Not so good-- Quality Merchandise,"My wife and I just recently upgraded our cell phones to the LG1400. I saw this package deal and thought 'What a good price for a case, charger, and hands free set'.BUT it all goes back to the old saying: '...you get what you pay for...'The hands free accessory did not work. We could not hear people nor could they hear us.The car charger worked at first but then the charger head became loose and would work 50% of the time.The cases fit our phones but the belt clip is really tight and does not clip on to my belt or my wife's purse without pulling and adjusting it forcefully.Buyer beware - cheap made products @ cheap prices."
1,Does not work for Samsung X427m,"Could not get it to work for samsung. Noice initially, call disconnects in 2 secs. Did not work, had to buy another one from plantronics for $21. Part of it could be a problem with the samsung aswell. since the jabra one for $9 did not work either."
5,Excellent prepartory material for the Praxis Economics Test,"I highly recommend this study guide. I first purchase Barron's AP Economics by mistake-- I read the reviews and one of the reviewer's suggested Kaplan. The reviewer was right. Barron was not what I needed; therefore, I purchased Kaplan. It was exactly what I needed for my situation. I am a special education teacher who has never taken an economics class before, but I wanted to take the Praxis economics test to teach a secondary regular education class. I am so thankful --- I passed!!!"
2,Cute but not durable,Perhaps it was our fault but we put most of our bibs through the washing machine (not the dryer). This one essentially melted.
3,interesante,"No creo que sea tan bueno como dice la otra cabra pero yo si se lo recomiendo a todos los que quieran leer algo un poco distinto de lo normal. Es una novela realista, por lo cual se incluye un monton de detalles innecesarios, pero leanlo igual, es algo para esas largas vacaciones..."
5,FANTASTIC,This is a very good recording of the Concerto's. I think one of the best out there. He uses so much emotion that you can clearly hear. another recording you should look for of the concertos is rubinstein's it's also quite good...
3,Why compromise! Turn your head around...,First of all this is a very good recording. Zimerman is a fantastic pianist. What I don't understand is why he hand-picked each musician! I don't find it obvious at all when I hear the result. It sounds just like any other Chopin recording. I find the orchestra too heavy and their sonority is hardly appropriate for the vital and brilliant music of Chopin. I would instead strongly recommend the recording with Emanuel Ax and the Orc. of the Age of Enlighment. Played brilliantly on an Erard piano it shines high above the Zimerman recording. And the orchestra brings out the music clear and beautiful. Even though the musicians haven't been chosen one by one!
3,Quite disappointing performance,"This CD contains 2 concerti by Frederick Chopin.Zimerman did a nice try in this CD with many rubatos of piano and orchestra which is very nice.However, Zimerman's solo performance here is rather disappointing. His tone colour seldom changes and almost played the whole piece with one atmosphere. The Orchestra did helped a lot with this. The passionate performance of young age has passed. Chopin composed these two concerti when he was rather young, full of teenager's imagination. Zimerman did rather more mature but can't achieve a higher state.Overall, the sound quality is ok and the performance is worth a listen for the integration of orchestra and solo which is quite difficult to achieve."
5,"Concerto 1, opus 11",Chopin in his concerto is inspiring and passionate. So much soul and life in this piece. What more is there to say!
3,"Different, yes.","I bought this because it was supposed to be different, and it is. Different means slower. While Josef Hofmann buzzes through #1 in 34 minutes and Rubinstein (far and away my favorite in both works) opts for a leisurely 40 minutes, Zimerman stretches it out to 46 minutes. In fact, the two concertos take 2 (!) CD's. Many people seem to love these performances, but they're not for me."
5,Excellent for Relaxation,"Listening to this disc was a pure joy. While not a classical music expert, I would highly recommend this disk to anyone interested in beautiful and rewarding classical piano listening."
2,"Nice details, no unity","I have nothing against slow tempi, but the problem here is that K.Zimerman concentrates so much on each an every detail that he seems to forget the whole picture. As a result, there is no unity, therefore the whole makes little sense at all.While I listened to this recording, I couldn't help thinkng about Pogorelich. Each detail is beautiful, but the whole seems to be rather ""incidental"" than built up. The fact that Zimerman picked up his musicians one by one may be a sign that of his painstaking attention to details. That is good, but it must not break the momentum of the whole picture, which is unfortunately the case here."
3,Not what I had hoped,"I was quite disappointed in this novel. Although Ms. Buchanan writes well, the [book] has very little depth. I was hoping for an interesting, not self-absorbed and ""glossed-over"" assessment of motherhood.I personally got tired of hearing how adorable her baby is. Doesn't EVERY mother feel that way about her child? I mean, she doesn't really seem to have much to say in this book, except that obviously she feels that how she mothers her child is very special. Perhaps a more suitable title for this book is ""supermom?"""
1,"Anne Lamott's ""Operating Instructions"" is much better.","I read a lot of books about motherhood before I had my son, while I was trying to figure out whether it would be really worth it. (ie., Is it as great as mothers always say it is, or are they just trying to bring happy motherless women into the baby pit with them?) I am still interested in reading about motherhood even though I have taken the plunge because I am still interested in finding words that describe the experience accurately. (It really IS wonderful but it sort of consumes you too.) Reviews seemed to indicate that this book had a revealing confessional honesty but I didn't find anything new here and it wasn't particulary well written. Anne Lamott's ""Operating Instructions - Diary of My Son's First Year"" contains many more ""Yes! So true."" moments and is more funny, and touching and beautifully written. To put it more succinctly, I laughed and bawled several times while reading ""Operating Instructions"" but this was kind of a bore."
5,Fabulous,"I personally thought this book was great and it seems very honest, although I wouldn't know, I don't have kids yet.But I gave it to a pregnant friend who said the tone was really quite depressing and she might prefer to read it AFTER the baby was born.Another friend who'd had a baby said she couldn't relate, and that she'd coped quite well with her baby - maybe she was just lucky.All in all, yes, some of the book was depressing, but I'm kind of expecting the first few months of having a baby to be both depressing and fabulous, so good on her for being honest and telling it ALL..not just the Hallmark moments!"
4,This is NOT a cookbook.,"""Looney Tombs"" brings a very light humour to a subject most of us see as quite dark: a funeral home. Dave Goulet grew up in a funeral home, and his wonderfully told tales of life in the parlor had me grinning in spite of myself.I'm not sure why he chose the word ""confessions"" for the subtitle, as most of the tales read as slightly funny, all-to-realistic romps through what could only happen in a family of four and some resident corpses. Though I'm suddenly wondering if I want to ever be put on display in a funeral parlor (there's an interesting story about bugs and a few cans of Raid I think I could have done without raiding), Dave Goulet's overall tone is certainly respectful.This makes a great gift for someone who has a bent sense of humour, and certainly served as a conversation starter when I had it on my living room table at home."
4,Nice product,"This item is everything that was advertised. I am able to bake bread, roasts, chicken, and many baked goods. Highly recommend for a low cost convection/toaster oven. The only negative i could say would be the convection oven itelf is not as good as the higher priced ovens, but very reasonable for the cost."
1,This movie does not star Pedro Infante,Although his picture and name are on the cover... This movie does not star Pedro Infante. He's actually only in one scene.
5,Beautiful watch!,"I needed a new watch for work/everyday wear; this fit the bill perfectly! Larger size for easy viewing (important for me as I work in a hospital), gorgeous mother-of-pearl dial. Nice heft, feels like it will hold up to the abuse I give my watches (has performed flawlessly so far!). Very happy with this purchase."
3,"Well made, attractive but date has never worked properly.",Bought watch as a gift for my wife. She loves it. Comes in a really attractive box and broadcasts the design and value of the watch very well. Only issue with the watch: have never been able to get the date function to work correctly.
5,A Must Have,The pray and Play Bible has a great lessons for preschool age children. All of these lessons can be used in whole or in part. Great resource for anyone in christian education.
4,Gottlob Frick LIVE!!,"I realize that the Wynn Morris 10th is the big attraction here, but the Eduard Flipse live performance of the 8th Symphony from the 1954 Holland festival should not be ignored; or should not HAVE BEEN ignored, since it looks like this set is a goner.The Flipse set was available for many years on the EPIC lable; the rather dim-sounding recording is a curio, since it was one of the very earliest Mahler 8ths in the catalogue (the 1951 Scherchen recording is also very scarce). The performance itself is not particularly noteworthy, save for the fact that the great basso Gottlob Frick is heard in the role of Pater Profundis in Part II---and he's really good.Now that this CD version has been deleted and the ""collectible"" price has gone through the roof, it looks like I'll have to stay with my old Epic vinyl set."
4,Great gift,Looks like a wonderful gift for a Wisconsin relative who loves the outdoors. Thought it would help with future adventures
3,worth checking out,Sister Sledge is a tight group very talented.i enjoy there music.it's a live recording of there material plus a Chic Cover.it only makes sense since Bernard Edwards&Nile ROdgers Produced the Bulk of there work.not as strong as the Album Versions but still worth a listen.
3,Not that great.,"The three spaces for the glasses aren't as big and deep as I would have liked. Most of my sunglasses were too big to fit in the holes and I was too scared to squish them in and break my sunglasses. I could only fit my small eyeglasses, which is disappointing because I wanted to use this multi-purposely. Also, the felt material on the inside provided nice cushion but attracts dust and was really difficult to clean and kind of a pain in the butt. The color and details of the product were exactly as shown though, which is the only positive thing I can really highlight. It does look cute and funky on my dresserboard but I wouldn't really recommend this to people who want to use it for slightly medium - large glasses/sunglasses because they simply wont fit!"
4,Probably their best album and well worth getting,The song that really sticks out on this album is Don't Go for those that know what the Eurovision is will remember a great performance by the Flowers and the finale was this. O'Maolai puts some great songs together I'm Sorry and Love Don't work this way are songs that will get stuck in your head and keep you singing all day. An excellent album well worth having.
3,"Decent story, but a few equipment flaws....","... (e.g. British didn't use 88mm guns in Africa) detract from a real war movie nut's enjoyment.My haiku review:It's about water.Not all right equipment shown.Tough go, losing side."
2,A travesty of history,"As this is an Italian movie that shows El Alamein from an Italian viewpoint, it is obviously biased in their favour, but it is patently ridiculous to portray the Italian soldiers as being heroic to the point of fighting to the last man, and throwing rocks at the enemy rather than surrender. The historical reality was the opposite of this. When the Italians first attacked British forces in North Africa, the British only had 36,000 available troops against 236,000 Italians. But despite being heavily outnumbered, the British routed the Italians, who surrendered by the battalion. In fact, it was only the intervention of Rommel's Afrika Corps that prevented the Italians from being totally kicked out of North Africa. Movies are notorious for taking liberties with historical accuracy, but this one stretches reality to the point of turning it into fantasy."
5,Stackpole returns as good as ever,"When I heard Michael Stackpole wrote another book in the X-Wing series, I rushed to my nearest book store to get it. His first four books were outstanding and his most recent thriller is just as good, if not better. I hope another of his books will be coming out soon."
3,"A nice addition, but not quite top notch","While I enjoyed this book, I have to say that the story as a whole seemed rather overworked. The plot made a few twists and turns, but nothing I found surprising.My major complaint is the same one I have always had with Mr. Stackpole's X-Wing novels (with the possible exception of _Rogue Squadron_). Every character has a story. With a cast this large it should be easy to develop a new prespective, but Mr. Stackpole insists on staying with Corran and Wedge. Some of the Rogues are nothing more than a name and a call sign. I find this limiting as a reader, espically after Mr. Allston's tour of duty. On a positive note, I must compliment the use of the droids point of view. I was wondering when someone would do that!If I sound a bit critical, it is because after 4 very good novels in this series I have come to expect more from an author that demonstrates as much talent as Mr. Stackpole."
4,A Great addition to the Xwing Saga,"A great book, this is on par with the first 4. It did a wonderful job of staying consistent with Zahn's trilogy. There were plenty of twists to keep things interesting, but I found myself missing Aaron Allston's humor that was so prevalent in Iron Fist and Solo Command. For anyone wondering if the series will continue, I know that X-wing book 9: Starfighters of Adumar by Aaron Allston is due out in August 1999. I look forward to returning the focus to Wraith Squadron."
5,YES!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am so excited that this book is coming out. I am desperate for a Star Wars fix. I am glad that the Wraith Squadrons section is finally up and I can go back to reading about my favorite character, Corran Horn. Until this book comes out I will have to consol myself by rereading ""Vision for the Future"" a hundred more times."
4,One of the best Star Wars series.,"Even though I have not read this book yet, I am very excited about its release. This is one of the best series out. Don't try to read this book without reading the other books in this series first. The authors make little suggestions in the books to earlier sections of the series. You wouldn't get the jokes, but if you read them you will be laughing up a storm. The authors of the series write about dog fights in space so clearly that you feel as if you are in the cockpit of the X-wing, A-wing, and even Tie intersepters."
5,Book! Book! Book!,Finally Ysards Revenge is almost out.It is a good thing to because I am going crazy I most have read I Jedi ten times. I need fresh Rogue Sqaudron reading material! The X-wing books are my favorite in the star wars universe. I know this book is going to be awsome. Besides I am counting on it to tide me over until the prequel!
5,Excellent!,"Full of everything I look for in a book. Action, adventure, exciting plot twists and, of course, plenty of Corran. Great way to bring Isard back, full marks for creativity. This book was equal in almost every respect to the rest of the series . Great job Mr. Stackpole!!!"
4,GREAT STORY!,"This book would have gotten 5 stars, except that nothing can beat Stackpole's last Rogue Squadron's books, but he comes very close with this one. Isard once again returns as everyone's favorite villian, along with enough cast from the comics to make those sad over its cancellation will be pleased. The only reasons you need for this book are ROGUE SQUADRON and MICHAEL STACKPOLE."
5,Finally the series continues,"after finishing book 7 i waited for the next to come, and now i find out that it is so close to finally arriving. I need this book to keep me occupied until the prequel comes out. THIS BOOK IS GOING TO ROCK."
2,Slow until the end,"Going from one of Allston books in this series back to Stackpole is like trading in your Porsche Boxster for a Fort Escort......It really slows down and the ride is a lot less fun. The first 3/4 of this book is filled with meaningless conversations between various characters, plotting and planning secessions, and various political maneuvering.........boring. The book doesn't get going until the last 1/4 and then as in other of Stackpole's books the story is just too weird and unbelievable to keep you interested."
4,Grand closure for an excellent adventure.,"Isard's Revenge is a quick read, but savory. For a SW fan it's like eating that wonderous dessert after the meal and realizing that you're down to the last bite so you had better enjoy every crumb. The SW universe is a great playroom, and this novel provides some great imagination blocks."
4,Star Wars,"This is a good series of books. Even though it is not centered around the major movie characters it is still interesting. There are a few known characters that have major roles in this series too. For example, Wedge Antilles and Corran Horn."
5,Great,"I think this book was the thing the X-wing series needed , a proper ending to Isard , I knew geting shoot up while during to get away was just not the way she had to go. The book had one thing i didn't like that much was that Michel didn't expand the charcters very much , like it was all just around 4 or so main charcters (I wanted it to have a bit of myn donos in it)he could have done want Allston did by spreading the story out more. I hope the Colonel's defender wings are in the next book becasue i liked to idea of the new imperial ships (better than anyhing else). Also Rogue squadron should be in it as well (and Myn and the lara/gara/kirney thing) Great book"
1,the worst star wars novel than slave ship,slave ship is better thasn isard revenge michael stackpole should write more better star wars novel than isard revenge
4,Another great x-wing book.,I liked this book. Stackpole returns to write another x-wing adventure and does well. It is not the best of the series but better than most Star Wars books written between the Thrawn trilogy and the New Jedi Order. The thing that bothered me was the summary on the back cover had little or nothing to do with the story. This book is worth the time to read and it will be enjoyable.
3,It 's getting old...,"Star Wars is getting old...Maichael A. Stackpole is a good author, don't get me wrong. I just think he needs to drop the whole x-wing deal, this is what? His fifth book and after every one I feel like I have earned less and less out of reading the book. For instance, in this book, he had no major enemy to deal with (cause he got 'em all in the other books) so he just up and created a warlord (how fitting), then to top it off he joins the warlord up with a cloned previous enemy, (Well, what'd you know, where have we heard that before.) and he books become increainlgly more soapy because of lack of material.In my opinion, try Wriath Squadron for a little humor, then ditch them completely and try something like Isaac Assimov's Foundation Trilogy."
3,"Seems to reuse ideas, a little slow.","I really can't understand why Stackpole wrote another X-Wing book. Why do we need to have another story about the Rogues? The Bacta War was a good enough ending, and this book just seemed to be a rehash of previous plots.I had a few problems with this book. The plot is really thin, low on character development, and reuses ideas we've already read about. How often does Mirax need to think that Corran is dead? Plus, the addition of Ysanne Isard's clone was just terrible. It seems like Stackpole decided at the last minute to write another X-Wing book, and couldn't come up with any new ideas. It's disappointing, because his other 4 books were great. He also can't seem to decide if he wants Iella and Wedge to get together. Slow, and uneventful. I loved the ending, however.If you've read all the other X-Wing books to this point, go ahead and read this one, if you must. I would reccommend borrowing it from the library, as it's not good enough to spend six dollars on."
2,the worst book than the heir to the empire,I found this book to slow micheal stackopole was trying to get backin form i did not like how guy died at rogues party from a drug this is not Tekwar this Star Wars. it is very interest to see isard back from dead. don't buy it just borrow it from the library heir to the empire is the Best Star Wars Book i have read.
4,"Very good, but not his best","I think Mike is better than Aaron, no offense. I think this book was one of the weaker ones. As others have said he used Isard again. That was a bit strange since in Aaron's previous book, solo command, the rouges were dealing with Zinsj (sorry if I misspelled that) and they didn't quite finish him off yet. But Isard is brought back in cleverly. I think the ending was weak since, without giving too much away, all the dead people started to come back to life again. One of the strange thing about Mike's books is that his pilots hardly ever die. And bringing back dead ones that he probably won't use again is a bit silly. I also regret that Wedge gets promoted. So all in all a good read, i recomend it if you've read the others and if you haven't, buy it anyway.PS if anyone knows if there will be anymore books in the series tell me. guns_galore64@yahoo.com"
4,What I hoped for,"The item came to me when I was promised that it would. when I flipped through the book, its condition was good, not just satisfactory."
5,German I: Pimsleur Comprehensive,I found this to be a great program and I would recommend it to anyone who desires to begin learning a new language. I have the abridged Intermediate course also and when I get through that I'll be getting the Pimsleur Comprehensive German II series. I also purchased an abridged Spanish course for a friend to try out and I am confident he will get the entire set.
5,Ten Star Rating!,"This is the best language program I have ever used...it really deserves a 10 star rating. If you want to learn German thoroughly and quickly, you've got to use this program. It's so good, I have even caught myself thinking in German after only a few weeks of study."
4,Live In Tokyo,"This CD reissue features Eddie Gomez on bass, Marty Morrell on drums and of course, Bill Evans on piano. The set represented here is of the highest calibre. Highlights include ""Gloria's Step"" and a swinging ""On Green Dolphin Street"". Also present is one of Evans most favoured standards, ""My Romance"" however the tune is let down by a poor bass solo by Gomez. Overall, this disc represents Bill Evans at his finist during 1969. Highly Recommended."
5,the best!,"This live album is a MUST have for fans of Bill Evans, but jazz fans in general.Not only is Bill on top of his game here, the drumming of Morrell and bass playing of Gomez, you could say, almost steal the show.A terrific collection of songs and a great recording as well.Buy it!"
4,Little Missing,"Mario is Missing, and it's up to you and Luigi to find him. Play the game as Luigi and friends, venturing through Italy's Colosseum, Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel, and more in this educational game from THE SOFTWARE TOOLWORKS.I believe that it is very important for children of ALL ages to learn about history, and I believe that this game does just that. You travel to many historic places around the world, attempting to find clues as to where Mario has been taken by the Koopa King himself, Bowser.Though the graphics are minimal, I think that they are right for the game. They do not distract you from the plot and storyline.. thus perfect for kids of 7+, all the way to adults. It is perfect for these ages because you can change different aspects of the game based on your age and comprehension level.I would recommend this game to anyone with children."
3,Horrible!,I do not recomend this game I played it on the internet and all you do is walk around jumping in pipes. Almost no action you just rarely see Koopas. I gave it 2 stars because it has cool original graphics. The crazy thing is you START in Bowser`s Castle and go to the city when mario is most likely to be Bowser`s Castle.
5,Great pump for a reasonable price,"I bought this pump for my Nissan 720 pickup when the pump that was on it failed. The install was a breeze and I had a reliable running vehicle afterwards. These are great quality pumps for a more than reasonable price and if you're looking for an OE replacement don't skimp out and get the cheaper ones because you'll be replacing them frequently. Spend a little bit more to get this pump and you won't be disappointed... or worse, left stranded."
4,Taming a Bear,"Melinda Oliver asks John Medwin to help her, after waking up in a hotel room with him in the other bed.Melinda needs to marry to keep her niece and nephew. Solitary author joins forces with author Melinda to keep the kid's wicked step-grandmother out of their lives.John buys off the wicked woman and peace reigns in their house.Alone with love. In Delaware.This is my first Elizabeth August book I've read. It was really good."
5,Back again!,"This is another movie I watched long ago. It stopped being shown for some reason and I tried to find it for years. Once I saw that it was out, I couldn't wait to add it to my collection and get a copy to send to my brother so he could enjoy it again too!"
3,Good prequel to Mad Monster Party?,"This cartoon feature wil only be appreciated by fans of 1970s Saturday morning tv and fans of the rankin-Bass film, Mad Monster Party? I loved the madcap speed of the film and the funny antics of the main characters."
4,From a much more innocent time,"Having purchased this title because of my love for Mad Monster Party, i was surprised at how well i loved the extra feature Jack-O-Lantern.Watching these old cartoons i wonder if today's younger ones would appreciate this show, i hope they would!Much appreciation to Vivendi, for remembering us older buyers and releasing these great classics from our childhood!"
4,how this book helped me,"I read ""fate worse than death"" during wait for outcome of my husband's heart surgery in Indianapolis hospital. Husband was 42 years old, kids were 11, 9, and 4--failed heart valve, very unexpected. Fate Worse than Death talked about literature as western meditation, versus eastern ""uhmmn."" Literature as suspension of belief, relief from everyday care. Worked for me. I read, calm as could be--essays from Vonnegut's life. When I finished the book, I started pacing and worrying. Started over to stay calm. Thanks to Kurt for compelling prose to last thru hours valve replacement!.Conclusion--this man is a hoosier. You may move to New York, but you are always home. Thanks--you pulled a thorn from my paw. I owe you. Jen"
1,Shallow,"This is good only for those who either prefer the biblical historicity approach, or would like to see how such a bland method leads away fro m appreciation of The Song of Songs."
1,"Classic that all high schoolers are to read, but why???","This is one of the most boring books ever, but they keep wanting students to read it. It has absolutely no value and is boring as can be."
2,Just read the real book!,"First of all, if you're too shiftless to read ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" you should probably quit now. Second of all, The book is awesome! You'd be missing out. I'm sure this is a good summary, but C'mon!"
1,To Catch or not to Catch,"As a freshman in highschool and an avid reader, it took me no time to aquire a copy of J.D. Salingers ""a Catcher in the Rye"". It blew my mind. There is no book of which I have turned pages to find a solution that has captured me and found me laughing or various other strong emotions along side that of Holden Caulfield. Then I discovered there were cliffnotes. Cliffnotes for such a timeless classic and not so hard of a read are superflous and only for those who are the laziest and most sad of all ignorant saps. Turn from this road in which you are about to embark and spend your money on a nice-warm copy of Catcher... and then pat yourself on the back."
1,Makes me want to cry.,"I think it's a travesty that they can make Cliffnotes on a book like ""Catcher in the Rye."" You can not possibly get anything out of the book from reading a chapter to chapter summary. Besides, the only people who use Cliffnotes are high school students who are too lazy to actually read the book, and every high school student should read CitR for their own benefit anyway."
3,Not the brush I wanted,I do not paricularly like this brush as it is too soft for my hair. i need something a little more reinforced.
4,HAVE TO GIVE IT SOME TIME,"This fits great in the hand. It's a good size; not too big, not too small. Feels good on the head and excellent for the beard, too. I do have to agree with one of the other reviewers in that the bristles do fall out while brushing...so far. It could just be that it's new and those bristles that are stragglers from installation will fall away, and that will be the end of it. If it continues much past a few weeks usage, it will go into the annals of useless Chinese trash, and I won't use 'Diane' products again. As the old adage goes: you get what you pay for. In this case, I'll just have to give it some time and either leave my review at 4 stars, or edit it accordingly.UPDATE 3/9/2012: My previous review will stand as is. My main concern was some of the bristle falling out. Now, several days later, all is well with this great product, and I can highly recommend it to you, the reader."
3,adequate brush,this is at best an ok brush to just leave in the car. the bristles are just a bit too soft for my liking and they stink. I love the spacing on the bristles which keep the brush from getting too dirty and if it does; it's very easy to clean. when the bristles get wet they have a unpleasant odor. it's actually difficult to find a descent brush that has the perfect firmness to it. this brush constantly leaves bristles in my hairPROS:smallnice black finishno handleperfect for a touch up brush to be left in the carperfectly spaced bristlesCONS:bristles have foul odor when wetbristles often fall out while brushingnot quite firm enoughOVERALL:i will likely order a few more just for leaving one in each of my cars. It's kinda too soft but that's better than too hard i guess
5,satisfied customer,very happy with the price as well as the packing & quality of brush. would not hesitate to purchase again.
1,Got on the wrong plane,"Hey, buy this book!Mister KEYES needs a job. Need to pay the AIR FARE back to Maryland from Illinois. The Negroes of Illinois were not impressed with this OLD TIME NEGRO recently imported into the state by the Republican Party and voted instead for Barack Obama who does not shout so much about EVIL people and does not inquire about your REPRODUCTIVE PRACTICES all the time. The same proved true for other Illinoisans who already have a STEADY JOB in the state. Mr. Keyes is thinking about a job in the rejuvenated BUSH REGIME, perhaps playing the soldier in some part of the world which he CANNOT FIND ON THE MAP but in the meantime he DID NOT GET THE JOB HE SOUGHT as he was OBSTREPEROUS AND OFFENSIVE TO HIS PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS. SO, please buy this book - you do not have to READ EVERY WORD."
3,Could be great,"This book takes a long time to get to the point or method of quitting nailbiting. The first half of the book involves a lot of repetition which could be summed up in one chapter. However, the method itself costs nothing, is very simple to implement and may in fact just work. I have only completed one day so far so I cannot say as yet whether or not it was successful for me, but I'm being optimistic."
3,Not completely convinced....,"It's a simplistic concept however the information behind it is useful to an extent. Depending on the individual's willingness, for me the information was slightly useful but nothing more. If you want to recognize when this particular habit is most evident in your life and its most probable causes I'd recommend it. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Surprisingly helpful,"I've been a habitual nailbiter since I was probably around three or four, from what my mom tells me. I've tried everything from creams to bandaids to false nails to powders. NOTHING worked. I stumbled upon this listing while browsing on amazon, and the word ""permanently"" caught my eye. I bought it, thinking I'd have another ""cure"" on my hands, but that it was better than doing nothing. I read through it, got to the ""treatment"" chapter, and my first thought was this: ""You've GOT to be kidding me. I just spent $14 on a book so some guy could tell me to snap a RUBBER BAND on my arm??? That's insane!""But... misgivings aside, I tried it, and it took right away. Within the first few hours I was more aware of my inspecting and picking and nibbling, and by the end of the first day, I hadn't put my fingers in my mouth at all!Still, a little expensive for the old rubber band trick (which I hadn't previously thought to try)."
5,Rubber band solution,"I owned this book and loved the solutions it offered. However, it only worked for me when in public. I find it much easier to just wear a clear custom-fitted mouth guard on my lower teeth, the ones you get at the dentist for weekly teeth whitening. Especially useful during my most vulnerable nail-biting moments (lap-top use). Otherwise, just a simple white sports mouth-guard works; however, this is more bothersome due to the bulk, and it noticable in public. Otherwise, buy soft cotton gloves when at home, or even finger cots (aka finger condoms. Only problem with cots is that they aren't easily re-usable and they can be too tight... All are inexpensive solutions that you can use. The clear mouth-guard works best for me, though.All the best to knocking this terrible habit."
4,"Great technique, but too long","The technique described in this book is GREAT--the day I started using it, I quit biting my nails (about a month ago). However, much of the book is just the same thing repeated over and over. This could have made a good pamphlet."
4,Slightly Disappointing,"Overall, this is another good album by the Loussier Trio. (I don't think this trio knows how to make a bad CD.) However, I think the original ""Play Bach"" CD is better.The original ""Play Bach"" was good because it is jazzy, yet the mood of the various works matched the original work by J. S. Bach. However, in this recording, that's not the case. The Brandenburg, for example, in it's cool jazz style lacks the warmth and joy of the original, and is rather much more restrained, sounding more like ""Bach's Brandenberg in the style of Eric Satie""This was still a good listen, though I doubt that I'll reach for this CD as I do with ""Play Bach"" and ""Take Bach""."
3,Don't Start Here,"And yet - that's exactly what I did. This is the album that got me hooked on the amazing music of Jacques Loussier and the trio. However, now that I have listened to sooooo many complete albums, this collection of Bach moments is not nearly as enjoyable as listening to sequential pieces that belong together. Does this seem like a negative review? I hope not. I hope you get a chance to enjoy this delicious, funky, classijazz hybrid. The Bach is amazing. The Satie is to die for !!"
1,Three Babes In the Woods,"Terrible! Awful! Poorly written. No editing for mistakes in grammar and punctuation. Luckily this book was purchased at a thrift store, so I paid pennies for it. The only reason it has one star is because without a star I can't get the review to be accepted."
3,disapointing after being built up by reviews,"THE NIKON 2100 IS THE EASIEST TO USE I'VE EVER USED, MY WIFE AND I HAVE 4 DIGITAL CAMERAS TOGETHER.WE BOUGHT THE NIKON FOR A DISNEY TRIP FOR THE COMPACT SIZE.THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES(SHARPNESS AND DETAIL) WERE DISAPOINTING,BUT CONSIDERING WE PAID $150.00 AT COSTCO I SUPPOSE IT WAS A GOOD BUY.I JUST WISH I HAD SAID SCREW THE SIZE AND CARRIED MY CANON G3 OR MY OLDER OLYMPUS D-460, BOTH SURPASE THE NIKON FOR PIC QUALITY."
4,A great camera at an unbeatable price!,This little camera is perfect for the amateur photographer. It is easy to use and creates excellent photos of remarkable quality. The addition of the optical zoom to a 2 megapixel camera allows for a great deal of flexibility without compromising on the definition of the final pictures. It is small (it slips easily into a pocket) but the control buttons are readily accessible and just the right size for the average finger. The softwear for downloading to a PC is also very user - friendly.And best of all - the unbelievable price! This is the best value-for-money deal to be found anywhere on the net.
4,Great little camera for beginners,"I received this camera as a christmas present and the setup was so easy that about 2 minutes after I opened the box, I was taking pictures. Lots of modes allow for beginners to have the help they need with correct flash and shutter speed for nearly every situation. Pictures are so easy to transfer to the computer, and it's amazing how big they are. And if not perfect, the programs that come with the camera are so easy to use that nearly every shot will look like you had taken it perfectly.The only bad thing is the battery. The original lasted about a week after continuously taking pictures, after which I got a NiMH recharger and set of batteries. Those don't seem to last too long in the camera so far, but perhaps after longer periods of recharging that will change.Otherwise, a wonderful camera. 4/5"
4,Competent beginner's camera.,"There is nothing wrong with the 2100 except for the very noticeable delay between pics. The camera's digital processor takes about 5 seconds after a photo is snapped to ready itself for the next one.Otherwise, the optics, the 3X optical zoom and the 2 megapixel resolution are fine for anything from Internet apps to 8"" x 10"" print enlarging.It is competent, not spectacular, but it gets the job done at an agreeable price point."
4,Good digital for the casual photographer.,"There is nothing wrong with the 2100 except for the very noticeable delay between pics. The camera's digital processor takes about 5 seconds after a photo is snapped to ready itself for the next one.Otherwise, the optics, the 3X optical zoom and the 2 megapixel resolution are fine for anything from Internet apps to 8"" x 10"" print enlarging.It is competent, not spectacular, but it gets the job done at an agreeable price point."
3,"Nikon Coolpix 2100 - Great Camera, Lousy software","Received this camera as a Christmas gift and really enjoyed using it. It's light, small, easy to use (throw the manual away - that's just too confusing)Great pictures and video but no sound? If there is I haven't found it yet.BIG problem is the flaky connection to a PC and the even flakier Nikon View software. I still can't get either to work reliably so I am going to return it tomorrow, Shame really, but Nikon should think about shipping some decent quality goods if they want quality reviews."
2,A great camera for anyone new to digital photography,This was my first digital camera and I have to say that when I first got it I loved it. However it has it's share of problems. It is almost impossible for one to shoot anything without a flash using this camera--when you try it is usually blurred. The focus is also a bit dodgy--the background of many of my photographs are very smudged looking. My recommendation is to invest a little bit more money and look into a camera with higher mp.
4,Good party camera!,"I really offer this for someone who wants to buy a party-recording device, or a tiny automatic machine. No manual focus, no manual aperture, but easy-to-use, handy machine. There are some good pre-programmed modes available also. 40-50 pictures can be made with well charged batteries. Good and user-friendly sw also included."
2,Very SLOW camera,"I bought the Nikon Coolpix about six months ago. It takes nice outdoor pictures, but it is so slow that you have to warn your subjects to hold still and wait for it to flash. I frequently get blurry pictures indoors or in low light. Forget candid photos because by the time the camera goes off, the moment has been missed. Also, the camera goes to sleep after a few seconds and then it takes about another 30 seconds to come back on. By the time you get the family posed, the camera has shut off, and by the time the camera comes back on Aunt Ida has already disappeared.Also, AA batteries (even the high-power-camera ones) do not work well in the Coolpix."
2,Problems with Refurbished Unit,"I bought a ""factory refurbished."" It came without the compact flash card which was supposed to be included. Repeated messages to the seller have been ignored.Also, I'm using recharageable NiMH AA batteries. After taking about 20 shots the camera shuts off and says ""low battery."" Recharging the battery shows that it's only about 20% drained. I'm not sure if this is normal or due to a defect with this unit."
2,poor reliability,"I bought this in December 2003. By January 2004, it was out of order (no power). I brought it in for warranty repair which took more than 2 weeks. The dealer only said that electronic power boards are sensitive. Nikon had no feedback inspite of my email complaint. Poor reliability, poor service. I used to be a Nikon fan, but I have changed to Canon now. I will not buy Nikon products anymore."
5,Firelight,"Loved this collection....ture insite into who the author is as a person, his thoughts and views on life in general."
2,Not the usual Waller,I finished reading this book but was not satisfied with it. Waller used his pen to express his dis-satisfaction with the way the environment is now and how it should have stayed the way he remembered it. I think that an author should write stories that entertain rather to than use his talent as vehicle to express his views. I've enjoyed his books and will probably read him more but I wouldn't advise anyone to read this book first but to save it for the last.
2,no wonder it's discounted,"when you put the back cover on, it makes it very hard to push up the phone to get to the number pad. the only way to keep it easy to push the phone up is to leave a crack of space open instead of pushing the phone back down. covers alright for the price"
1,Its a rip off piece of S***!!!,This thing sucks--its bulky and makes the phone look cheap--i threw away my money on this item. Dont do it!
5,Exactly as Advertised,Not much to say other than it is the Cutler Hammer product it is supposed to be. It was as cheap as anywhere at this website.
3,Storyline is wearing thin at this point...,"While I read this entire series when it was originally published, I had a chance to reflect on the work when looking at a friend's TPD collection, and I realized that this series went on too long. By the time the reader gets to vol 9 (of what should have been at 6 or 7 volume series) it's too much. All Ennis is looking to do is inject shock value elements to this story, which was wonderful in it's first three or four years.Sure, get this volume to get to the end of the story, but don't expect the excellence that was there before."
5,An epic end to an epic tale,"As engrossingly blasphemous as the preacher series was, this one caps it off with the subtly of a mushroom cloud. Without spoiling to much, I'll say the following happens: 1. A suprisingly one-sided battle between two former best buds. 2. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. 3. A...shall we say genitalia-impaired chrome dome exacts his revenge. 4. An extremely disfigured, yet refreshingly optimstic, boy finds salvation. 5. Heaven is ravaged beyond belief. 6. A Creator answers to His Creation. 7. A series ends a hell of a lot better than Seinfeld did. That's about all I can say except, buy this book and get a small facet of closure in your life. It's worth it. Oh, and never ever show this to your parents if they aren't extremly open-minded."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The end of the story, as Jesse gets to point out a few cold hard truths to various people, human and otherwise. Jesse gets to point out to God why he is such a big fat, loser. Cassidy gets a second chance at things again, even if perhaps he does not deserve it. Yes, Alamo is the end, and the last stand all rolled into one."
4,the end.......BANG!,"the cool lines,the action,the gore,the blasphemy,the eye patch and the (suggested for mature readers)tag on the back of this book,makes it simply, irresistable.this is the conclusion,here you'll learn what will happen,to the runaway zeus like deity,his cowboy angel of death,the antichrist lookalike crusader,the irish vampire and the eyepached preacher's quest for vengeance.and not forgeting arseface.all in a hell of a twister cult storyif you are a church goer -or a mosque goer in my case-and marilyn manson doesn't offend you,but makes you laugh sometimes,then buy this book.if he does offend you ,you better look away.some reader complain about the ending ,well ,as arseface said""WUHL..BUGUHZ CUHND BUH CHUZUHZ!"""
2,"Cute, but there's not much here.","This is a cute storybook with photos of a little white rabbit who lives with Sarah and her family. Buttercup the bunny grows up and has bunnies of her own, and Sarah gives them away to her friends, so they can have rabbits, too.Truthfully, I didn't see much story or lesson here. I also found it disturbing that the animal was received as an Easter gift, like a chocolate marshmallow. (Is there anyone who does not know that this is wildly inappropriate?)The photographs are cute, but not spectacular. I recommend passing on this one, because there is far better to be had elsewhere that is more appealing and educational. (Sorry, Sarah, you really are cute!)"
2,Save your money...,"Unfortunately, this book reinforces every negative stereotype regarding rabbit ownership possible... the only way I could use it was by playing ""True or False"" since there was no way to read it with a straight face."
3,good read,"This book has pictures from what looks like the 1970s and so that's a little off-putting, but my kids did enjoy it overall. We got the puppy one and the pig one in the series from the library but they didn't like those as much. While this is in the Before Five in a Row series, it was not one of my kids favorites. They enjoy the occassional movie/show that's not animated but the books w/pictures seems more of a boring medium to them and doesn't hold their attention as well....especially b/c this book is longer than some of the other ones in the series of BFIAR"
5,"God Satisfies, Sustains, and Secures Us","This book was recommended to me by my counselor. It has helped me to ""know"" that God is all I need. He created us to have relationships with other humans, however, He is our ultimate provider. Pastor Stowell delivered in a way that is easy to comprehend. I actually felt myself growing closer to God as I read it. The book is a keeper -- to be referred to over and over again."
2,Not helpful,Too repetitive. They need to be more concise. They tell what the problems are but it does not go into productive ways to alleviate them.
5,Just what the doctor ordered,This book comes highly recommended by my doctor and is living up to its reputation!
3,Definitely for older children,"I bought this for my four year old grandson who enjoyed it to a point (he loves books where you look for things) but this was not age appropriate for a four year old even a very bright one. As one reviewer said, the pages are very dark and it was difficult to see and find the images. I don't think my son and daughter-in-law were too thrilled with it but we did have fun doing it together as a family. There were a few items none of us ever found. It is definitely a book for older children and I am sure they would really enjoy it."
3,Hard to find some things but the kids love it anyway,"This is the third book in this series that I've purchased. In some ways it's better than the others and in some ways it's not. The production values, i.e. the photographs are the best I've seen yet but it's often difficult to find what the book asks you to find. This doesn't really bother me that much because I just look for my own things and ask my 7 and 4 year old to find that, or vice-versa, but I figured I'd give other shoppers a heads-up."
5,Tricky treat,One of the trickiest in the I spy series. That will keep you occupied for hours. Some of the best pictures are in this book
4,Enjoyable,"We are enjoying the book. Sorry can't find the third spring. Only found one. In fact we would like help on a few pages. We can't find the third acorn on page 10. The two birdies of brass on page 14. That's all for now. Does anyone know of a website where people give helps for finding things in the I Spy books? By the way, on the Scholastic web site there are lots of great games with I Spy. One has the library page and you find lots more cool things. You might be able to find the spring."
5,great halloween table book,i liked it so much... i bought 5-6 and gave them as gifts..... then i found they had a christmas book...... then the little books for baby's.... can't wait for the little baby christmas and numbers..... i have spent so much on marzollo & wick books.... i should buy stock
1,recycled previously released live versions.,"As much as I love Tom Jones, the songs on this CD have been released on numerous CD's prior to the release of this CD, nothing new. Instead Time Life should release volume 3 of his TV show of the late 60's early 70's."
1,I hate this chair!!!!,"This high chair was terrible! I really liked other Peg Perrego items and I liked the look of the high chair, but it is terrible! The food tray will not move close enough to your baby so every ounce of food falls in there lap! It is a pain to use! After only a year of use it looks terrible!! I have never sat a child in a worse high chair! My mother, sister, and sister-in-law all have high chairs that work much better and costed much less!!! They also hate my high chair. I will be putting it out on the curb for the garbage men and buying something else for my next baby!!!!! Worst investment I ever made!!Signed Alison from Las Vegas"
2,not as nice as it appears on the Internet,"I initially registered for this high chair because I thought it was supposed to be one of the best and also because it did not appear to be tacky like all the other plastic high chairs did (well in person it is). What a waste - I returned it and used my BRU money for other things. If you are looking for a functional, stylish high chair go with the Svan (not sold at BRU) - it is worth every penny and can eventually be converted to a toddler chair. When it all came down to it the Prima Pappa was still plastic and tacky and plus it is HUGE - one of the biggest high chairs out there."
3,Bells and whistles not worth the price,"Had I not received this as a gift, I wouldn't have purchased something with so many gadgets I'll never use. I've seen lots of nice looking high chairs way less that this. Besides, most people use a high chair for feeding baby in, not for playing music or rocking in. It was initially quite a feat to set up. I never used the optional small tray and so far we've only been on solids for 1.5 months but it does seem to get a bit sticky in places. I do like the rollers - great on wooden floors. It looked so super snazzy when we set it up in our kitchen while I was pregnant, but having a baby has made a more practical person out of me!!!"
1,Dondelino Prima Pappa,"I have to admit I thought this was going to be a great chair because of the rocking feature and the music.... VERY CHEESY. The rocking feature was disappointing as the chair could not be in the reclined position while using that feature. Minus the music and the rocking, I knew the Prima Pappa was a good chair as I have seen, read, and have friends who love it. I thought this would be a step up. I sent it back after having checking the extra features out. I reorder the Prima Pappa model and am VERY happy with it. They missed the boat on adding these features to the chair. My advise... don't spend the extra $ on the new features.. not worth it at all."
2,Don't bother - get a simple/cheaper chair,"SO not worth the price! The chair is impossible to clean without having to take off layers of padding. No matter how careful I was to keep it clean, after taking off the pads, I was horrified at how much food had accumulated. The rocking motion was very unsettling to my son, who is not ever fazed by anything. I even have the next model up, that plays music, which is actually only annoying. Also, the chair is HUGE, and takes up way too much room in our kitchen. I wish we had kept the other, simple chair we had been given instead of this gift. Aside from it looking kind of cool and being apparently comfortable for our son, I would never choose to buy this."
2,No good for smaller than average children,"We bought this highchair a few months ago when our now 10-month old son started eating. He is small for his age, and we have hardly used it because the tray was too high and far away from him to reach. We ended up buying a 30 dollar booster seat for him which we use until he, hopefully, grows into being able to use the seat. I do think it is well constructed, but it is not good for smaller children."
3,"Good quality, but has its drawbacks","I have this chair in the non-rocking version. Although this is a very durable, stable, nice looking, and relatively easy to clean chair, it does have its drawbacks.1. The tray does not slide in close enough to my son's belly, so lots of food always ends up in the seat and on his pants. Good thing my dogs like to clean up all the crumbs afterwards! This is probably the biggest problem because now, at 20 months old, he can wriggle out of the harness and stand up in his chair even when the tray is on.2. The removable tray is nice, but it is disappointing that it cannot fit in the dishwasher. I end up using the main tray and having to wash both items more often. Perhaps an additional tray would be ideal.3. No toys (at least I didn't know of any). I will have to look to see if I can get some. It would be nice if they were included with such a high price tag."
2,pretty but useless,"This is a beutiful high chair, it looks nice with the rest of the dinning room, but it is TO LOW. The tray is very high, and when you move it up or down the tray moves with the chair. My 11 month baby has such a hard time reaching for her food, and I love babies to self-feed themselves.The two stars are because the design is nice, it is easy to recline, move up or down and it has an extra tray to use a second one for playing or dessert.Overall, I wouldn't buy it again."
4,mixed,"I'm a beatles fanatic. I even play in a tribute band here in Texas. Anyway, I like to pick up any Beatles related stuff I can find. I'd have to give Beatles Tribute: Number One Again mixed reviews. Excellent guitar work, solid bass, keys, etc, but uneven vocals. Some of the singers are good, some not. Hit and miss"
5,As Moving A Movie As Any Ever Created,"I saw this movie but once many years ago when it was first released. It is a difficult movie to find, and I wonder what mystery surrounds the movie itself as to why it is a rare find. I say for those of us whom have the chance to get it do so as it may become one of the rarest movies to ever be found in the future. I know there are some controversial subjects within the movie that may have made it an ""undesirable"" movie to market,.....such as sterilization (castration) at asylums for young orphan boys. Whatever the reason, the movie was well acted by Mark Harmon and his supporting cast. This movie will leave you touched deeply and probably like myself and others; will not escape your memory any time soon. Brilliant and Touching, this is one that should be kept locked up and preserved indefinately."
4,Let the Balling Begin!,"Just as one viewer said, the last time I saw this movie I was about 13 years old. I cried my eyes out. I could not believe how touching this movie was. I saw it once and out of all the movies I've seen in my life time, (probably close to a million since I'm a movie buff)this is one of the few movies that I will always remember. I didn't know it was a true story which makes it even more profound. I would love to see the movie again I'm sure it will be just as good as the first time if not better. I love a good cry!"
5,A Movie About a Father's Love for his Sons,When I seen this movie on TV I just cried. I fell in love withit! It's a movie that shows what a loving dedicated fatherwould do to get his sons back. It's a very powerful movie withgreat actors in it - including the boys who play his sons. Irecommend this movie. A real tear jerker I guarantee!!
1,Broke on Second Use,"Mine broke on the second use. The part of the handle that screws into the claw bent at a weird angle, and I wasn't even lifting a particularly large log, either. What's worse is that I spent about twenty minutes on hold at the seller, left a message finally, and never heard from them again."
2,"Flimsy, didn't last long","I bought this about 2 years ago and it has seen little use. It has always seemed flimsy and I always had the feeling that it wouldn't hold up. The other day I was using it to lift a paper birch that was at most 6""-8"" around and the cant snapped. I would try to find a better model."
4,pretty handy,very simple but effective tool which is what makes it so useful. feels solidly built but only time will tell if that holds true. Ive gone out and put it to the test for about 4 hours the other day and it worked much better than jamming a log under the piece that i was cutting. I wish it wasnt made in china but thats pretty much impossible to avoid now.....UPDATE!>>>>Nearly 2 years later and this thing is still holding up just fine. I've cleared a sizeable amount of my lot by hand (and chainsaw) and my woodstove is still hungry for more!
2,Timberjack,"The tool for the intended purpose is excellent, however the point on the pivoting hook is so blunt that it does not penetrate the timebr you are trying to lift."
3,Not what I was looking for.,"Okay book on how it works and what you need, but it wasn't what I was looking for."
3,Lacking,This book had a lot of good ideas. But it lacked any practice or implementation of the ideas
5,Very Interesting!,"In ""Turning Toward the Mystery"" Stephen Levine shares his own spiritual journey - from heroin ""junkie"" to ardent spiritual seeker - it's quite a journey indeed!I found Mr. Levine's writings to be very poetic - sometimes flowing, sometimes disjointed, but always leading the reader to another insight. And, although there were times when I wasn't quite sure what he was saying, I had the feeling that his words were simply planting a seed, and the greater awareness of their meaning will come in time.Overall, I found this book to be a truly interesting, enjoyable, & insightful read. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in spirituality and/or Buddhist concepts. It has a lot to offer!"
3,misleading,"There are 480 gloves, not 480 pairs, but they are still a good buy. I'm pretty amazed that these are still represented that way."
5,great bargain,I needed lots of gloves cheap for my middle school forensics class. These are perfect.
2,One size NEVER fits all......,"I have large hands and expected to have a snug fit but these gloves are in the ""Small"" range. Labeling them ""One Size Fits All"" is irresponsible and misleading. One would assume that the gloves would at least be a Medium size. Also I have to note that the box is an odd size. If you have glove dispensers you may find these boxes are not going to fit. So sadly, these gloves won't serve my needs as much as I wanted them to. The subscription would have been nice but..."
5,Could not put it down!,"As with the others commenting here, it was difficult to put down. Had to eat so it was but highly recommend this story. I hope Joe (Or Floyd) will continue with his life in the CIA and to date, with another book.Hugh"
5,Excellent Start into Literature,"All of the pocket classics are an excellent way for parents to introduce their children to the best literature. This book in particular opens a window onto the works of Mark Twain, and from this one small book, the little people in your life can leap into the days of yore through Twain's words and the marvelous illustrations."
3,Nice hat..but waaay to big,The beanie is nice and looks just like its advertised. Only problem is it is way too big. I have a large head and it is still too big for me. Makes the beanie pretty much unwearable so beware.
5,An essential book,"""Art at the Turn of the Millennium"" is an essential book for browsing the work of the best artists of recent decades. The book provides an indispensable taster of many contemporary artists with large color pictures and succinct text.Certainly many great contemporary artists are missing (such as the still active significant ""architectural artists"" as Siah Armajani and Alice Aycock). However, no book can do justice to all major artists in the current wide contemporary field, and in light of the outstanding collection, any omissions are forgiven. (Indeed many of the work are 3d or video, as reflects the art climate of the last fifteen years. Nevertheless, most revered and noteworthy art in recent years has been 3d artwork and/or video.)An updated version of this book, ""Art Now"", by the same editors also is also obligatory reading for contemporary art lovers."
2,Focuses mainly on three-dimensional art,"I was disappointed with this book becasue almost all of the artists work is sculpture or installations. In my opinion 'art' should include painting, printmaking and all media. The book's title should have been Three-dimensional Art at the Turn of the Millennium. The format and images in the book are very nicely displyed though."
1,"Fine presentation, poor content.... almost nothing to see...","The publication and print quality are fine. What I wonder is how does the authors decided and qualified that kind of ""art"" as the art at the turn of the millenium. Certainly, this is one of the disadvantages of buying through the Internet. I would never buy book of this kind if I first see it on shelve."
5,A Fun CD,I thoroughly enjoy this CD. While it is not long and contains basically one song it is enjoyable and fun to hear again and again.
5,Absolutely wonderful,Michelle Lewis has a style of folk music that is nothing short of amazing. Her music is very easy on the ears and quite pleasant to listen to. Her voice is absolutely enchanting and could sooth the most savage of beasts. I've had the distinct pleasure of meeting her twice and she is an absolute joy to talk to. I strongly encourage everyone to give this album a listen to. You'll be most please with this purchase.
2,Another poor book on Rebirthing.,"This is a little better than Ms. Ray's first book ""Rebirthing in the New Age"". And the only reason it is better is because of the Appendix, which includes chapters written by other Rebirthers such as Jim Leonard and Eve Jones.There is really not much substance in this book about Rebirthing. It will not teach you at all how to do it. And this is one of the biggest problems with almost all books on Rebirthing. None of them really teaches or encourages you to do them on your own. All say that you should get sessions from a Rebirthing Professional, 10 from a female and 10 from a male trainer. Even after that, when you can do them on your own, you should still regularly get others to Rebirth you. (This can be quite expensive.)I was really disappointed with her book, especially considering that Ms. Sondra Ray is supposed to be one of the original founders and a current leader in the Rebirthing field."
1,Mixer quit after 2 loads,After two loads (2 bags of quikrete each) the mixer just quit.Made the rest of the job fun.Basically I paid $500 to hand mix half a yard of concrete in a wheelbarrow.
5,I love it,There is only one version of one song that I couldn't place - you know all the rest of them.
4,"Not a cutting contest, but a fine west coast album","You might get the impression from the cover photo that this is a cutting contest between Conte and Lee, but that's not the case. They only play together on two numbers on the album; and the rest of the tunes feature one of the two. That's not to say there isn't some great playing from each of them--there is. This is a first-rate, laid-back, west coast album which also includes some great blowing from Rosolino, Golson, and Cooper. Candoli and Morgan are each in great shape and neither sounds as if he is intimidated by the other, nor are they trying to one-up the other with pyrotechnics. Highly recommended."
1,Icky... Chocolate Peanutbutter....,"These were probably the worst tasting bars I've ever had. I don't know if they were stale, in which case it would be the venders fault, or if they just taste bad. Either way, I don't recommend them."
3,"Good, but there are better","Not bad. Over all quality is there, but I am not impressed with the slight artificial sugar aftertaste. To me standard sugar alcohol based chocolates are better."
5,Atkins Advantage Bar- Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,"Atkins has a winner here! They've provided the sweet chew and portion satisfaction in this fudgy bar with none of the guilt. With a treat like this, it's easy to stay within the carb limits."
3,"Taste pretty good, WAY to hard to bite.","This review is for the Atkins Advantage Dark Chocolate Almond Coconut Crunch bars:These had a nice flavor, but beware of the stiffness of this bar if you have TMJ or any amount of dental work that may get seriously tested when attempting to eat this. It feels like it is stale, but the date says it is fresh, so I assume they are all like this. I like the Atkins bars on the whole, but I will not be buying any more of these tooth chippers. I will be sticking to the softer centers since the granola-crunch style need some reworking.The coconut almond delight are great, so are the caramel chocolate peanut nougat ones."
3,not what I expected,"These looked soooo good.....coconut and dark chocolate ummm. However, they are so hard I thought I broke a tooth. I had to dip it in my coffee to eat it. Doesn't taste bad. Won't buy this one again."
2,"Cardboard flavor, but nutritious","I'm pretty sure that these might be made out of recycled cardboard boxes, and despite the chocolatey bottom, there's no chocolate flavor or texture at all. They are absolutely effective for a no-carb shock diet like the Ideal Protein, but I have a very hard time eating one of these compared to other bars. I'd rather just eat eggs, meat, and protein shakes if this was all there was, but Atkins does have more tasty bars. Watch out: They're very high fiber and usually get you going within an hour or less. Now that I'm way past no-carb and only do low-carb about half the time, I'll be glad to leave these bars behind once I finish the last few."
2,"Great taste, horrible aftermath","I was really excited when I tried these bars. They have low carbs and great taste. Too good to be true? For me, yes. I had some of the worst stomach cramps of my life after eating these. I wasn't sure whether the bars were to blame, so I experimented over the span of a week and sure enough, whenever I ate a bar I had terrible stomach cramping afterwards. I've read that the sweetner can have that effect, and boy did it ever on me. Hopefully others will be lucky enough to eat these tasty bars without the bad side effects. Just be informed that if you get bad cramping after eating these, you probably can't tolerate the sweetner."
3,not for me,"I'm sure these would be great for someone else but for me it caused GI distress, a result of the sugar alcohol maltitol, which is a main ingredient be careful before buying in bulk. i had to give this away to friends."
2,be careful,Item arrived stale and had to be thrown out.I dont recommend ordering this..Was a wasteof time and money...
4,Quite good,"My cheif complaint is the side effects I get when I eat this bar. As many have stated the sugar alchohol used as an ingredient can cause (and sure does for me!) loose stools, gas, and stomach ache. That being said they are indeed tasty, and lots of folks can eat this with no issue. As for me, it's like xlax with peanut butter."
3,Just OK,The bar is really sticky and hard to chew. I was afraid I would pull out a filling while eating them.I won't buy them again.
2,More sticky than crunchy,This bar is much too chewy. Difficult to bite through then it sticks to your teeth.kind of like taffy. It does not soften for several moments. Taste is OK but I am not reordering it.
2,Very blah,"Better choices out there and here why:Poor consistency (mine kept falling into tiny pieces)Chocolate tasted very bitter and chalkyGranola part was essentially tastelessSugar alcohols - potentially bad for your tummy and impacts actual net carb countIf you're desperate for a granola type thing and you're on a low carb diet, I guess go for it, but there protein / low carb bars that are a lot better."
3,not what i was would have expcted,the flavor is good but the cream on the top of the bar is chewy and sticky not creamy at all. it was good but could have been better. this is from someone who loves atkins bars and flows the diet!
1,Hard and Sticky bars,"These Dark Chocolate Almond Coconut Crunch bars are TERRIBLE...like they are stale. I thought maybe I got a bad batch, but the second box I received were just as bad. I am afraid of breaking my teeth on them. I will NOT be reordering these, and we've thrown away uneaten bars. I LOVE the Caramel Nut Chew Bars the best!"
1,Not Atkins' best bar,"These looked like they would be great. The artificial sweetener taste is too strong. They are also very hard as someone else had mentioned. The Atkins Chocolate Coconut Endulge Bars are my favorite, I don't notice any ""diet"" taste in them."
2,Dark Choc. Almond Coconut Crunch Bars only,"I have tried many flavors. This particular one I will not buy again. Maybe it was stale?? It was hard, tough to chew, not crunchy in the slightest, and a strong coconut flavor. Waste of money, when there are delish bars like Chocolate Hazelnut out there for a cheaper price on Amazon. And BTW, all you who say it is cheaper at Walmart? They are $4.50 each here for a 2 pack. At Walmart they start at $5.67 up to over $7. :("
2,Maltitol syrup is not for everyone,"I was just looking for an interesting snack, and almonds+coconut+chocolate seemed to fit the bill, but I guess I just didn't know what ""Atkins Bar"" meant...?I really think any product containing artificial sweeteners needs to have that information available in its listing, which seems to be missing for this product, as of this writing. I had hoped this would be an Amazon policy, and there seemed to be some effort in that direction in the past, but a lack of product information seems to be a disappointingly increasing trend.Contains: MALTITOL SYRUP and SUCRALOSE."
4,Very tasty,"It actually is more caramel-y than I expected. Really good! A little like the Double Chocolate Crunch flavor, but a darker chocolate, as advertised. Little less crispy, more fudgey."
3,Not my favorite.,"This is by far my least favorite flavor of Atkins bars. I feel like the bar has a funny, almost chemical like taste.I could forgive the taste, but these bars seem to not make me feel full like some of the other varieties.Still, the nutrition is decent and the texture is almost identical to a traditional granola bar."
5,Great book on American Art,"This book is extremely well written, well rounded, and well researched. A great book for a art history student or someone who is just curious because it examines the subject matter from several points of view - not just the standard white male version of history. Folks that are normally breezed by in other texts are discussed here in length - finally! I loved reading this book and gaining insights into the history of what makes American Art unique in it's vision. I am a college art teacher and will be recommending this book for my next semester. Thank you to Frances Pohl!"
4,Pretty good textbook,I used this for a 100 level intro to art history class and it helped me very much. The pictures really helped break up the text for easier reading
2,Missing pictures,I would like to say good but I can't because pictures have been cut out of book. I needed some of these images to review for class. The book should have been checked first.
2,Overall a dissapointment,Having read the entire Book of Lists/People's Almananc series since I was a kid I was eagerly anticipating this newest version. I have to admit to being dissapointed in what is at best a rehash of some of the prior lists.I would estimate that somewhere between 40-60% of this book is nothing more then repeates from previous books. While the original content is as fascinating as ever all of the warmed over lists really hurt this books experience for me. Having read the books by the folks at Mental Floss and the Bathroom Readers it would seem that the torch is being passed to a new generation.
2,book is bunk,"I first read this book in the '80's. This new book of lists is practically the same book. No new information, and much of it is just re-stated, if you have read the original Book of Lists, don't bother with this one."
2,"Hardly the ""new"" Book of Lists","I'm not sure why they call this The New Book of Lists, because there's very little that's ""new"" about it. Having read the previous books in this series (which were from the 80s) I was disappointed that most of the lists here were taken from those earlier books.If you are new to The Book of Lists series and looking for a ""greatest hits"" collection, then maybe this book would be fine. But if you have all the other books, don't bother. Too bad this book had such a misleading title, or else I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Book of Lists,"I got this book as a gift for my sister-in-law. She is very quirky and outgoing, but it is hard to figure out what gifts she might like. We haven't given it to her yet as her birthday is in a month, but we flipped through and it seems like a great gift. It is a little more in depth than I thought it would be too - instead of lists like the top ten things to do in an elevator, and jokes like that, it includes actual facts and the reasons they are in the list - such as lucille ball's top 10 favorite tv shows. It spans everything from politics to pop culture and is almost three inches thick! wow!"
4,almost as good as the original,"This was a lovely book, but it doesn't measure up to the 70's version, which was written in very small print and seemed to have twice the information The New Book of Lists does. Entertaining, though, and fun for a short while."
1,There's no track listing here,"Can't expect people to buy it if they don't know what's on it. C'mon, guys, get it together."
2,Not entertaining. Actually not much of anything...,"This DVD set doesn't look professional. Cheap camera work combined with ok (at best) music make this DVD a mildly entertaining 40 (x3) minutes. The sequencing is ok, each DVD starts with a visual tour of each city accompanied by music. There are maybe a total of 20 girls dancing in this DVD set (some of which are far from attractive). Some of the girls are on two different DVD's, which is kind of weird since it's supposed to be a different city on each DVD. I bought it so I could play it in the background on mute when I spin at parties, but this is not the right DVD for that. The music in this DVD doesn't match the dancing, and since the girls aren't professionals, the dancing itself is pretty awful. If you want to see girls dancing to techno music, go to a club. The last ten minutes of one of the DVDs are a lame interview with some unknown DJ, which is totally pointless."
5,fear review,The Fear inside is a really good movie christine lahit plays a women who is agorophbic. dylan mcdermott and jennifer rubin play sleazy characters. its strange seeing dylan mcdermott play a character like this because he usually plays good guys. i would reccommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller movies.
5,Discover The Art of Hiding Data,"Not knowing much other than the definition of steganography before opening this book I found it very easy to read and very informative.Eric Cole has a background in working with hidden data and his experience is translated into a book that even users new to the concepts of covert communication can understand. The fictionalized stories of actual events help the reader to understand how these tools are used every day by both the good guys and the bad guys.The book covers a basic history and background of cryptography and digital watermarking as well as steganography and then gets into more detail about the techniques and concepts of ""stego"". It does provide source code, but may not be ""meaty"" enough for steganography experts.(...)"
3,Silly editing mistakes and empty information.,"Call me silly for expecting more from this. This book rollercoasters from the wildly vague overview to the distractingly specific detail and back again. The author shows promise in writing style but the editing needs some work. Typos and silly mistakes like the majority of the second half of the book's images appear taken from a Word document (or similar) while selected (border, drag handles overlayed) and LOTS of white space.And how useful is 80 pages of printed source code? The CD is included, just save the trees and my shelf space please.The author is a seemingly public figure (TV show appearances, etc) so I guess you can only expect so much.If you're looking for meat on the topic, don't bother. If you want a basic overview in a weekend read, go for it."
3,It's okay,I bought it mostly because it was the only place I could find Dale Gonyea. He was funnier when I saw him. That's all I really watched. Howie Mandell was very corny.
5,Infernal Violins,"This music is fantastic. Because the violin she uses is a Stradovarius, the music pours like liquid velvet out of it. The choices of compositions are fantastic also. I think her interpretation of them along with the violin and her back-up group are what make this album so outstanding."
5,Excellent find,"My second purchase of an Angele Dubeau cd, and I can honestly say I am glad I found it! I listen while driving, and the sounds are so compellingly beautiful. I think this would be a good cd to start someone on the classical genre. Definitely keeping it in mind for gifting."
1,"For a ""harder than maple"" board, it sure isn't as sturdy!","I am so disappointed in this cutting board. The first one I got, looked like it had been gouged and used. I got a replacement easily enough, but this one cracked all the way down the middle the first time I used it and washed it. I hand washed with a mild soap and water immediately after I used it and even rubbed it with mineral oil. When I took it out to use again, I discovered it had a crack in it. Very disappointing and what a waste of my Christmas gift certificate. Don't buy this, it is junk!"
2,"Weird book for ""required reading""",Sorry I can't give a better score but I think this book wasn't the best but that's not the fault of the Supplier but I thought we would have had the book sooner than it arrived. :(
1,An uninteresting book,"The book was very dull it had better use as a textbook than a pleasure-reading book. Trying to connect to the characters would be like trying to teach an ameba to roll over, no character was given enough screen-time, or page-time to be correct, to get to know them. The book started telling how Elizabeth's story, which influenced modern Cinderella stories, then you suddenly are reading about how many people believe in witches today, after that about how Marther helped a family in need, ect... After awhile you begun to think, ""Who is the main character!!!!' I would suggest this book to no one it is the worst book I have ever read. All in all if you want to read a good book don't read this one."
5,Excellent Source of Information,"I loved this book. I ordered it for an informational book evaluation I was writing for my Youth Literature class, and I read it in, like, two days. It's easy to understand, thought provoking, and of course, just the right amount of creepy to be entertaining as well as informative."
2,-,"Not much on neural nets. A good overview of a signals and systems textbook for those who want to learn about filters without all the math. I was disappointed that there wasn't a results section for the NPREDICT tool, just a bunch of flags and parameter garbage to tweak."
1,Just get to the point!!!,"Having an Engineering degree and having read many many technical books, I found the level of explanation and content including examples to be very poor. I bought the book on the belief (Aus$100) that I could learn something from it after having read the synopsis on amazons site. Please Amazon be more accurate with the content analsys of the books you are selling.I know I have been ripped and there is not much I can do about that! I am just warning other people to be wary about purchasing books that they do not know the content of. Trial and error can be so expensive if you live in Australia!"
1,No idea for whom it was written,Do not buy this book unless you already read it in a library and just like it to be on the shelf. All ideas are very well known and code is almost useless.I found much better sources for free on the web.
1,QAF - The Book,"Interesting for the back-stories on episodes. Great pictures, fun to read and browse through, especially after re-watching a season or an episode."
3,The Making of Marchioness,It was almost a did not finish. Way too wordy for me. Story was good but slow. Needed more sensible dialogue.
4,no title,Quite delightful little novella - written about 1884 or somewhere in those Victorian times. A woman's romance from start to rather abrupt finish.
2,Weak characters,"I had to force myself to finish the book. The premise was interesting, but the character development was weak and the plot line predictable once the action started. There was little depth in the exploration of the differences between a good, professional artist and the products of the old masters (like Leonardo). The evil characters were one dimensional and the romantic connection in the book was awkwardly portrayed. There was little suspense, and no surprises. At the end, a decision is made that could easily lead to a sequel, but I will be sure to not order it. For a fascinating art mystery read Michael Gruber's ""The Forgery of Venus"". It is complex with lots of revelations about the art world and insights into what makes some paintings (and painters) exceptional. The prose is a joy to read and the story is never predictable."
4,"Careful, this is not a Quick Start guide","The book you probably want is: iMovie HD and iDVD 5 for Mac OS X : Visual QuickStart Guide. This is the Quick Project guide. The total content of this book would fit on 3 pieces of paper. So why did I give it four stars? It's beautiful, not very expensive, and it does provide the key information you need to actually produce a decent DVD.It's simply that it's rather sparse. I ordered it by mistake; I thought I was getting the Visual QuickStart guide. I didn't bother returning it because:1. it's not a bad book, I'll give it to a friend2. it's not worth the hassle to return.All the same, be sure you don't really want the QuickStart guide instead -- that series has much more material in it."
1,What a major disappointment!,I am a long-time fan and bought this because I loved the show. This CD grates on the nerves; it is merely a selection of songs from the guest spots on the show -- they didn't even try to remove the guest introductions at the beginning. Hence the jangled nerves. It gets tiresome hearing the same introduction over and over again. I have also been informed by the fan club that this is not authorized by Tom or his manager and they are discouraging its sale.
3,"Fun, limited","3 1/2Electronic snippet grooves make for flashy background, but as a concentrated listening experience, exerts only so much after repeated listens, as would be the norm with this type of well intentioned but ultimately disposable hip-tronica sub-genre graced by the likes of Prefuse 73 and Blockhead. The difference must be in the details, since a few of these tracks swim so well that future success behind the boards for this artist seems absolute, but still at least half sinks from underdeveloped inclinations."
4,Not Really a Ghost Story,I picked up this book largely because of the cover--and I liked the idea of a cat ghost. The ghost cats don't show up until the very end of the novel. Still... I loved it. What a wonderful young narrator. And I disagree with the other reviewer. I didn't think it was sad. Just very real... about a difficult time in a young person's life.
3,bad acting,When the older sister is having an attack it is a terrible job of acting. it didn't fool me or my 7th grade class. other then that it is fine.
2,Flimsy construction...,"Pack-a-Stand trumpet standI've been playing trumpet since 1962 and have used or seen virtually every trumpet stand there is.Several years ago, I bought a Pack-A-Stand, sight unseen. After using it for short while, I threw it out. It was very light weight, which was nice, but it was also flimsy and weak. All plastic with a few metal parts to latch the legs open. Made me nervous to leave a trumpet on it. I play in four bands and know dozens of trumpet/cornet players. None of them use this stand.The customer reviewer that prefers this stand over the K&M; must be referring to the THREE legged K&M;, which can easily tip over with your trumpet on it.The five leg K&M; trumpet stand is, in my opinion, the only ""store-in-the-bell"" stand worth buying. It is stable and strong, and even though it weighs more, it's well worth the few extra dollars over this inferior stand. Search Amazon on K&M; trumpet stand."
5,Free your energy!,"This album with the 100 percent masculine artist from Venezuela makes you want to live your life wrapped in latin music. There are some wonderful soothing love songs on it, but the rest is pure energy and they will make you move your hips, move your body and dance all the night away. I have done that a number of times, so take my word for it. You should even try to get hold of another album of his: ""You nací para querer"", it's just as energizing."
5,Great cd,"I recommend this cd to anyone who likes David Bisbal, Yahir, Ricky Martin, Juio jr, Enrique, etc... It is especially similar to David Bisbal and Yahir."
5,fits the budget,this shed is pretty sturdy once assembled. We bought wood for the flooring and anchored it all down. It did not come with any kind of latch or lock for the door
3,My Contractor Assembled It,"I asked my contractor to assemble this shed, and I'm glad I did. MANY holes did not align properly, and the center brace along the back wall was about 4 inches too short. He was able to jury-rig a replacement brace, and figured out how to drill new holes where necessary and make the whole thing work. I like the end product, but I would never have been able to do this myself, and because it took over 8 hours of contractor time--with about 4 hours of my help--I probably paid as much to assemble this shed as I paid for the shed itself. On the oher hand, it was the only shed that seemed to fit where it needed to fit on our deck, so we didn't have much choice. If you need a shed this size and get lucky (or can wait for the right parts or work around the problems), the end result is acceptable."
4,You get what you pay for,"The shed looks good and isn't hard to assemble. I assembled it with my neighbor in about 3 hours. The most important thing is the foundation. You must have a level foundation or the door will not close right and some of the roofing pieces will not lock in right. Start with a solid level foundation and everything else will be easy.One thing that I dislike is the door height. The doors are rather low and directly on the inside of the door is a beam. I am 5'10"" and have banged my head on the beam at least 5 times since I've purchased it."
4,Fairly Cut,"What is a plus in this music book is that it includes additional artwork previously unreleased, or just released on the LP edition of The Final Cut. Also showing some stills from the fairly rare VHS that was released at the time, to be more precise, from the ""Not Now John"" music video. The music is very well transcribed for vocals, keyboards and accoustic guitar, but still, no Guitar Tablature Edition is available on the market , which might not be suitable for Dave Gilmour's die hard ""Solo"" fans. Mind you that some of the rare artwork in the book was released on the Remastered Edition of The Final Cut CD."
5,Kept Promises and Social Change,"Promises to Keep: How Jackie Robinson Changed AmericaIn this wonderful biography,Sharon Robinson shares her father with us as a daughter who held her father in high regard not only for his achievements in breaking the color barrier in baseball, but also for his hard won victories in politics, busines, civil rights and as a family man. Through love letters to his wife Rachel, photos from the family's archive and Sharon's deft writing hand, readers get to spend time with Jackie Robinson and come to understand how he navigated his way through the treachery of racism to become an integral part of creating another important chapter in the social contract with America.As the Vice President of Educational Programming for Major League Baseball and an author, Sharon Robinson continues to preserve her father's legacy--well."
5,A Daughter Remembers Her Father,"This is a wonderful book written by a daughter about her father. The father happens to be Jackie Robinson, an important man in baseball and in African-American history. She remains down to Earth and describes the life the family led and how her father affected the family and history. Jackie Robinson was a giant among men and knew what he was doing. It is a credit to Robinson that he was able to make himself above reproach and acceptable to the white public. It had to be very stressful to him and his family to try to be perfect but somehow he was able to make it. A very moving story, simply told by a loving daughter."
4,Great for the price,"Over all, I'm impressed by this little player. The screen gives very descent video quality, the built-in speaker is loud and clear, and the video conversion software is simple and easy to use. The provided instruction manual is absolutely useless, it's a series of seemingly random words in what I can only assume is supposed to be English; but the menus and navigation are very simple and loading files onto the player is also very simple. Over all: two gigs of easy video and music playback for a great price."
3,Looks Good........From a distance!,"Very cheaply made, pressed cardboard type material (not even particle board)and held together with wire brads. It was of course broken upon arrival, the drawer had come apart. Easier to glue and clamp it back together than to send it back. Great DYI project. The merchant did well, fast shipping and all that. I just bought cheap instead of good."
1,Big disappointment!,"This measures only 28 X 15.75 inches, not the. 33 x 19 advertised. I knew it was a cheep piece of knock down furniture but I never would have expected this."
1,Bad,Got my Item broken. It looked like it had been thrown from a plane. They did return my money but ruined my daughters Christmas gift.
4,How My heart Sings,"I'v been listening to Bill Evans for about eight years now and I must say I'm a fanatic. I started my Bill collection with The Village Vanguard albums. I originally bought those albums to hear Scott LaFaro, but I was blown away by Bill's piano playing. Since then I have increased my collection to 23 albums. How My Heart Sings is in my opinon a transitinal record for his then new trio with Chuck Isreals on bass. Never the less the music is very good. I wouldn't say it is my favorite bill album but it has some great moments,especially the reworking of Gerswin's Summertime built around Isreal's bass ostinato. This version in my opinon is the must original and fresh version of this classic. Another good thing is the presence of Bill's originals. I also enjoy the title track by Earl Zindars. The bottom line is that this album is worth it."
2,What the hell was this?,"I thought this book was going to be pretty good, because I read ""Love Undercover"" and I enjoyed that one a lot. But then I bought this book ""A Royal Vow"", and I couldn't help but laugh. It was so stupid. I mean one minute they were all enjoying dinner and the next she's kidnapped. Her best friend Chris was forgotten. I guess their friendship ended when she didn't go with her in the car. Than when she gets kidnapped and the two love bugs end up on some island, the people thinks she's this ""Ab-bee"" princess from 2000 years ago, and the warrior man,who wants fight Davis (the guy in the book), over Abbie, he gets mad they go at it, and then when the fight begins, Abbie says ""STOP"", and the fights over. WHHHAAAATTTT!Oh my Lord, it was just so stupid, I couldn't wait for it to end. I went on and read it cause I just had to find out how it ended, and of course, it didn't end right. Please don't waste your money on this one folks. It's not very good at all."
4,Reestablishes thefolk/rock/blues genre in the Bay Area,"The Naked Barbies are a cultural fixure in the Berkeley area for many years now, and this first album of theirs finally allows their rabid fans to enjoy a bit of their energy outside of the nightclub. For those unfamiliar with their music, the melodious layers of folk, rock and blues will seduce you into their audio dreamland throughout this disc. Listen attentively for the lead singers exceptional voice and the roads it can take the listener musically and lyrically. Especially powerful is the work of their drummer, which will remind those of us over 30 of Ringo Starrs younger, more aggressive days with the Beetles. An exceptional album from a rookie band who has since produced two more discs, and promises fans that there are more on the way!"
2,Change the name or get a clue,"Does the name 'Naked Barbies' conjure up thoughts of a COUNTRY band? A very competent country-pop band with a talented female vocalist, but not a glimmer of punk attitude, nor any kind of an offbeat, skewed sensibility. In today's mainstream country music arena, songs like ""Good One"" or ""Best of Me"" would be perfectly acceptable garden-variety radio fodder. The most unusual thing on this CD is a version of ""On the Street Where You Live"" that scraps the original melody entirely but still manages to be...inoffensive. Kind of a marketing nightmare, since the Mary-Chapin Carpenter fans who might enjoy this CD won't buy it because it's by a band called Naked Barbies."
3,"Disjointed, but good.","Although there's an interesting ensemble cast and the background of ancient and modern Rome, I found the story a bit disjointed, in part because you have Italians written by an Englishman, sounding like Americans. But there is good suspense and several very good twists."
1,Get ready....to vomit...,...purge this poison from your mind. I've banished Barney from our house and I'm reloading for the Wiggles. This is like candy corn for the mind. They make the Elmo merchandising machine look like a lemonade stand-how can you not be cynical about the array of Wiggles crap out there? Not to mention the ticket prices they charge for their appearances.That Henry the Octopus has driven me to drink. Utter stupidity.
2,Watch out!!!,Hi: Being a house full of Wiggles fans we saw this coming and were excited. A chance meeting at Target over this past weekend we saw this one the shelf. Flipped it over..its ALL THE SAME SONGS!!! If you have all the tapes steer clear..it appears to be a rehash. I can't give it a real rating..but come on..NEW MATERIAL PLEASE.
3,"Ok Video, Other Wiggles Videos are better","My son loves the wiggles and has manny of their videos. However, this one is not continuous music and he finds it boring. I would suggest getting the Big Red Car Video. He loves that the best.Have fun Wiggling1"
4,Peek at the TV show we don't get to see in the US,"I bought this take knowing full well that most, if not all, the songs were repeats from other tapes. But a Wiggles fan has got to have a complete collection. My 3 year old son enjoys this tape a lot. He thinks the skits are funny. From what I've heard, this tape is really 3 episodes of the TV show that we can't get in the US. The TV show has educational value in addition to entertainiment value. In the episode on the tape, they teach about caring for you friends and family and about growing up."
2,disappointing,"My 16 month old and I really love Wiggle Time. It is fun and she likes the music and tries to do the motions, so when I came across this at a great price I grabbed it up. So far we have only watched it once and may never watch it again. There is a LOT of talking in between the songs and the stories don't intro the songs--they are just random. I would recommend trying one of the other movies."
4,Great for a 2 Year Old!,"We have a two year old daughter who ADORES the Wiggles. Although the material on this video is from various TV episodes of their show, I have to say that this DVD is magical. When we can't watch The Wiggles on TV (they're not on or we don't have any episodes left on our DVR), this is a GREAT fallback when Wiggles are requested! It's also proven itself on long car rides- pop it into the DVD player and voila! A happy two year old who requests it over and over again! I think one of the reasons this is such a popular video with kids is because it's just like the TV show. Some folks seem upset that this video is comprised of their TV episodes-- but that's why kids like it. Forget what YOU think-- how does your child react?"
4,Acid Techno?,"Trance on steroids. This album might not take your mind on a never ending journey like most trance discs but it sure will make you feel like jumping up and testing the output on your hi-fi, in fact that's the only way to appreciate these relentless rythms and wacked out synths. While the discs have diversity in pace and style which is cool, you find yourself occasionaly wondering why the music sounds like dubious house music, dont let that put you off! There are some undeniable techno classics-to-be waiting for you right here."
1,did not work,"we tried several systems and this did not work in any of them it was a faulty memory stick. I have to contacted them to work it out, just to annoying to do that."
4,Things That Need to be Said,"This book was a revelation for me. It opened up avenues for research and exploration that I was not yet ready to open on my own.Did you ever have an intuition that everything was not as simple and rosey as some would have you believe? Did you ever think that there was more to the story than was being revealed? If so, then this book is an excellent resource for you for topics such as misogyny, celibacy, sexuality, family planning and morality.I am a Roman Catholic and a religious educator, but far from finding the book to be shocking or full of ""dirty words,"" I found it to be an insightful challenge to the church to return again to the central teaching of Jesus and to turn away from its obsession with genitalia and what people do with them. There is more to faith than that. And only by embracing the truth of our past can we grow beyond it."
3,So-so tees,"When I was ordering I was looking for a tee that had smaller arm openings. These have larger openings. Also, I must say the sizes run a little small. This needs to taken into consideration when ordering."
5,Great Burner,"I'm using one under Windows 2000 and another on a machine with Windows 98se. It is awesome! Super-fast burns and no incompatibilies with anything that I've ever used. Nero is a great piece of software, and I've also tried Roxio CD Creator 5 and they both work like a charm (but don't install both at the same time, they will fight with one another). I highly recommend it!"
5,Easy,"CD-RW drives should be a commodity by now, but there seem to be lots of problems surrounding them still. This drive is easy to set up and use; I haven't had any problems with it, the advertised speeds seem to be easily achievable, and there haven't been any glitches yet.The box is full of software for both Windows and Mac, I happened to be setting it up on Linux, so I didn't need this, but everything needed to install and use the drive was there, including a sample disk, labels, a label positioner, and all of the cables and screws you need.Great value for the price."
2,Do NOT buy it if you use WinNT only,"Yamaha clearly indicated on the box this drive runs under Win95/98/ME/NT/2000 and the SUPPLIED SOFTWARE RUNS UNDER NT. However the included packet writing software Nero InCD does not support NT 4.0. The Yamaha tech support was not helpful and said it was Nero's problem.It IS Yamaha's problem. Do NOT pretend the SUPPLIED SOFTWARE runs under NT when it does not, at least now."
1,There's a reason it went straight to DVD,"I love zombie movies for some reason. The remake of Dawn of the Dead is one of the better zombie movies to have come out in quite a while, so I had high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately this is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. There is no script whatsoever, the zombies are pretty much super human (run 30 mph, scale walls, run on the ceiling, etc.) but when the main characters need to get away somehow the zombies become slow, dim-witted morons again. The dialog is terrible; the whole movie is just plain awful. Avoid this movie like the plague; it is flat out terrible."
5,"Not a remake, but a great movie","If you love scary movies and horror films like me, i advise you to see this film! Get over your feelings that it's a Romero remake... The zombies are scary as hell, running all over the place. This film builds onto ""The Dead"" collection and should definitely be given a chance. Mariah gave Nick Cannon a chance and look how well that's doing!"
2,Why was it called Day of the Dead?,"Really didn't like this. I thought that with Romero's name attached to it, that it would be of higher quality, but it had nothing to do with the original. Hopefully it will be forgotten about.The only reason that I gave this movie 2 stars is because there was a couple of brief scenes that I really liked. A couple of shots in the beginning of the hospital scene were cool. They lasted maybe a couple of second, but I really thought they showed some great zombie carnage. Note that these parts didn't have any zombies crawling on walls or jumping like the raptors in Jurassic Park. Too bad these were the only things noteworthy in this movie."
2,Pretty Bad,"I watched this movie despite the bad reviews it got and it was so-so at best and god awful at worst.The writing and acting was pretty much Dawson creek. None of the characters were believable. The computerized special effects were very badly done. The regular special effects were decent.Ok, so the movie did try to add new dimension with the disease aspect, the vegan zombie and the smart zombie. Not done well enough to justify breaking the 'zombie rules'.The only part of the movie that I did enjoy and added to the 'zombie takeover mythology' was the massacre scenes at the hospital. It was nice to see the 'first hour' attacks on a lot of unsuspecting people. Other films hinted at it and the Dawn of the Dead remake had a small amount of it, although not like this--with tons of panicked people in close proximity to the zombies who are taking them down and feasting on their bodies right and left.See this movie if you are a die hard zombie fan, but certainly don't pay money for it."
3,A Superior Sequel to a Overrated Original,"3 1/2 stars = Very GoodUnless you're a hardcore George Romero fan, & a fan of the original ""Day of the Dead,"" this 2008 remake is a much better film in every way, though the original's Tom Savini make up was incredible! To bad everything else was dangling dead rotted Zombie testicles. Of course, testicles are not much use to Zombies, unless their Zombies from ""Dead Alive, LOL!"
2,dissapointed,"I am a huge zombie fan and was excited when I saw this movie at my local entertainment store. I regret buying it. The acting is horrible and so is the dialogue. There's a scene where the sick mother is at the hospital talking to one of the soldiers about her daughter..... she refers to her daughter as being ""hot""......????? Seriously what mother in this world tries to pimp out their daughter like that?! Another thing I hate about this movie is all the sexual content.....horror movies aren't freaking pornos! ughhghghghgh"
4,If You Like Fast Zombies...,"I liked this video enough to pay $5 for it. I found it entertaining because I ignored the title and enjoyed it for what it was without comparing it to the Romero flick which wasn't very good anyway.It is a self contained story that does not follow the Romero Trilogy in any way.I love fast zombies so it was not hard for me to get in to this movie. Dont believe all the scathing reviews. If you like zombie horror, give it a chance. If you liked the yawn inducing ""classic"" from 1985, which shares its title, then you probably needn't bother."
3,What happened Ving?,"Let me start by saying that usually I love anything that has to do with Zombies.That being said, this was a pretty crappy Zombie movie.I was kinda excited when I saw it at the video store, and Ving Rhames is in it so I was like ""Sweet!"". That is, until I watched it. You can tell its gonna suck by the first couple minutes. I'm not sure what Zombie formula they were going by, but it was a little like ""Clive Barker's The Plague"". They get some kind of cold, a nose bleed and then BAM! they wanna eat your face off. They're Zombie-ish, but not really reanimated walking dead.I'm giving it 3 stars cause I have a weakness for Zombies, and there is SOME decent gore. But the over all movie/story line is eh, so so.I'm not gonna go into this really deep, so I'll sum it up with this.If you want to see this movie, RENT it before you buy it."
2,Day of The Dead,"It's an okay follow up to the Ving Raines ""Dawn of The Dead"" but this time his character gets killed off half way through. Originally he was supposed to be the brother of the cop in the earlier film...I still have a problem with zombies who can run a marathon. The special effects were good but see the original by George Romero also"
1,Whatever You Do--Do Not Get a Nosebleed...,"This 2008 remake--it really isn't a remake at all; more of a retake--of George Romero's vastly underrated film, at least tries to be different. The germ causing all the commotion becomes airborne, and if you start coughing and then have a nosebleed--WATCH OUT!The movies takes place in Leadville, Colorado--so did ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown""--(the original was in Florida), and I do wish that someone would explain that having lead characters who have the acting presence of a turnip will hurt your movie. I need to care something about someone. The only original spin shown here is that if you're a vegetarian while alive when you turn into a zombie, you won't eat people because you don't like meat.Lots of exploding and lopped off heads, this movie missed its marked by a wide range. Ving Rhames role was a total throwaway and I thought director Steve Miner knew better.Rated R the movie lasts 87 minutes."
3,Not a true remake but still fun,"First off this is not a true remake of the George Romero classic Day of The Dead. It's really a remake in name only. There are a few things similar but even those things are done completely differently.Now with that being said, I thought it was an alright movie. It's gory with people running for there lives and getting eaten. I really saw it as a mix between Day of the Dead and Return of the living dead (both great movies). An though it lives up to neither of them, it was still worth watching. Also the zombies are much faster and more brutal!So in closing if you like violent, gross, high speed zombie movies then you really should find this movie at least entertaining. Just remember this is not George Romero's classic Day of the Dead."
2,A tiny bit amusing,"Yes well, lets make it clear they include ""the need to feed"" in the title, because this isn't in any way shape or form related to Day of the Dead. I'm not a Romero homer, I enjoy Romero but don't whine that Dawn wasn't true to his vision...the Dawn remake rocked it! This one, not so much.I gave this film the two stars for sheer cheek, I mean, in what other zombie movie is a director going to be ballsy enough to give zombies spiderman-like agility & ceiling clinging abilities?!?! Haha it's so ludicrous that I couldn't help but laugh.Script gives the characters no, well, character. The Director seems to have accepted a movie outside of his comfort zone. It's sad to see the sexy Mina Suvari so down in these dredges..."
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A terrible low-budget ""remake"" that has almost nothing in common with George A. Romero's 1985 classic aside from one or two character names and a zombie/military theme, this version of Day of the Dead has absolutely nothing to recommend it aside from the short running time, which ensures your misery will at least be brief."
2,It bites!,I was in the mood for some undead chills but I should have just re-readZombie Factory: 27 Tales of Bizarre Comix Madness from Beyond the Tombinstead of wasting my time with this mess.
3,I'm surprised at these reviews,"I'm honestly surprised at these reviews, because the movie is not that bad. I watched it months ago with some friends and we pretty much enjoyed it. I mean it's not The Dawn of the Dead or anything, but it's still a good watch. I personally liked it because the zombies weren't the run of the mill granny-slow walking zombies. They actually run and keep you jumping. I think this is one of those that you have to see for yourself and not really trust the reviews. Honestly, it's not THAT bad!!!"
4,day of the dead.,Don't care what anyone said. Love this movie has lots of shoot em up and nick cannonade a comical character is real funny.
1,Awful,What a waste of 87 minutes! This remake has to be one of the worst movies in the genre. Do not rent or buy! Ever!!!!!
1,Horrible,"This piece of **** is an insult to the original. George Romero should sue! See the originals ignore all ""remakes"" Romero's originals are dark edgy social commentaries. This and the Night of the Living Dead remake with Sid Haig are just ""cash-in"" product."
4,a Curmudgeon review,"This Day of the Dead version was better than I expected.The make-up was first rate. The plot was good, the movie flowed well,and the actors worked well together.The only problem I had was the zombies. They are very, very fast.Humans have very little edge on these monstors. I am surprised anybodycould survive. It had one of those ""what the!"" endings. Enjoy."
3,Great Acting,"This was an okay movie, typical zombie movie, the acting was good, if you are an avid horror movie person who likes really scarey movies than this is on the average scale. Not too bad."
1,No es una versión fiel,"La película es mala, pobre en efectos y con un guión mediocre que no semeja en nada la historia en la que se supone se inspira. Que decepción para los amantes del cine de Romero, no la recomiendo para nada."
1,Not a Romero movie!,"This remake of Day of the Dead was horrible start to finish.I rented it (glad I didn't buy it) and was aghast at how stupid it was; that feeling peaked when I saw a ""zombie"" leap onto the ceiling and crawl around on the ceiling. WTH?! That's supposed to be a corpse, why can it walk on the ceiling all of a sudden???They shouldn't have been able to call this movie, 'Day of the Dead' it was a horrible knock-off right from the start. The Bub-zombie in the original Day of the Dead is replaced by a dorky Bud-zombie who was some pathetic half wit to begin with.Do yourself a favor, buy the original Day of the Dead. Romero did it best."
1,Even @ $1.00 Redbox rental.. I AM OFFENDED!!,Total low budget garbage. WE ALL SHOULD BE ASHAMED AT A RAPE OF THE ORIGINAL.. WHICH WAS PURE ART!
1,Same action as the box cover,"The movie made me want to vomit, I couldn't watch more than half an hour. Bad acting, bad movie - do not buy this!"
2,So Cheesy....It's....,"Ok, it's just cheesy.I like Ving Rhames, but to say he is wasted here would be an understatement. Mena Suvari isn't all that bad, again...wasted. Even Nick Cannon has his moments at times, but here..nothing.The gore was over the top, which takes away from the movie. If a movie is going for that over the top gore, ok...but I don't think this movie was trying to do that. From everything I have read Steve Miner, the director, was hoping to make a decent remake of Romero's classic, so why the excessiveness? Everything was over the top...the gore, the reactions, the forced dialogue.....And the biggest mistake, wasthing talented actors.IF you are bored, and NOTHING else is on TV you might do worse, but don't waste your time or money on this."
1,"If ""Stupid"" & 28 Days later had twin babies this is the stillborn one...","If ""Stupid"" & 28 Days later had twin babies this is the stillborn one...This is not so bad it's good, it's just pitiful.I won't waste words on this poo-fest. but, quickly: bullet dodging zombies, wall crawling zombies, super powered zombies & vegetarian zombies...does that cover it?Avoid this, it's two hours of yyour life you won't get back. The movie is only an hour & a half but I included 30 minutes in the two hours so you can curl into a fetal position & cry it out..."
1,"Anytime someone asks me if this movie was good, i tell them: ""A zombie flips upside down and crawls on the cieling."" Enough Said","Horrible. These people should be executed for using the title ""Day of the Dead""Anytime someone asks me if this movie was good, i tell them: ""A zombie flips upside down and crawls on the cieling."" Thats really enough said.This film is probably one of the highest budgeted STV films ever made, And the reason is, It was such a horrible movie, It could not get theatrical distribution.Not only is this a piss-poor representation of the ""Of the Dead"" series, It's also one of the worst zombie movies ever made. Considering the sheer volume of low budget zombie flicks that come out during any given year, thats quite an accomplishment.Avoid like the plague.-1/10"
5,5 Star Worthy,"I have no idea what movie you people that rate this movie under 4 were watching, but it couldn't have been this one!!!!!!!!!!! The acting in this movie is fantastic, the picute is nice and crisp and clear. The title is not meant to be a remake of Day Of The Dead, clearly it has a subtitle ""Day Of The Dead - The Need To Feed"" The story of this movie is good and it came together well. As for the special effects, I thought they were very good and not low budget. All you people that rated it under 4 were watching this movie looking for it to be a remake of George Romero's film and that is why you rated it so low. You have to watch this movie as if it were just another zombie movie and you will like it. I watched it twice the day I bought it."
1,A bloody waste of film.,"I can't begin writing this review claiming to be a fan of the original film which I liked, not loved. But I can honestly say the most revolting portion of this film was the time I wasted watching it. Nothing happens until twenty-four minutes into the film.You die, suddenly you look like you've just risen after a ten year slumber. Batman can't climb on ceilings, but you can as a zombie. The Flash can barely keep up with a zombie. Bodies are stashed in closets by ingenious zombies. All in all, Dean Cane's zombie soldier movie sucked but rivaled this monstrousity."
3,Ok Film,"Even though, its not a great remake of Day of the Dead, i am however, very surprised since it wasn't that bad..I've seen worse than this. However, it tends to copy the Dawn of the Dead remake and it fails..now, i can see why it went straight to DVD. The acting is a tad ""so-so"" and the story line seems to be every where in the beginning and the middle part of the movie, however, almost towards the end after watching parts of it trying to ""fit"" (which was too little too late) it all started to fit together for the film. However, i'm glad that this will be the last of NOLD movie remakes for some time. If you have nothing better to do, this would be an OK rental at best."
1,Remake Day should DIE....................,"A friend of mine give me this movie to watch. When the movie had finelly finished, I felt my time was wasted. Bad effects, bad acting, and horrible story. I guest George Romero don't care who remark his films. The original Day of the dead was a classic. I hate it when horror films get directed with a don't care attude. Steve Miner you suck for making this garbage. Georgie! NEXT TIME TELL THIS GUY DO A GOOD ON YOUR TITLES!"
2,This is NOT George Romero's Day of the Dead,"This is not a remake, but a completely different (and way inferior) zombie move. Stick with Romero's original. It's much better, even though it is older and somewhat dated."
3,it wasn't that bad,"As a zombie fan i enjoy this movie,it have nothing to do with the original,just the title and some names like Sarah,Dr Logan Captain Rhodes that in a way is stupid but after all the terrible reviews i thought it was really a disaster but is not. Dawn remake is better but not that much better. In this movie you find spider zombies and in Dawn remake there are sprinters zombies but what can you expect from a remake,there is no way to compared them with the original,just enjoy them for what they are remakes and enjoy the zombie action in honor of the old classics and the master George Romero."
2,Zombie Film,"Based on the Romero classic, a virus infects a Colorado town and the military is brought in to stop it. These walking dead crave human flesh. The few survivors must battle zombies, trying to make it out alive. It's not bad, but not a classic either."
4,Preety spry 4A dead guy,"This is a great little gem of a Z'flick. Miss titled since most of the Z'action happens at night. Not bad editing either. I liked this one because all the basics were covered. Small town, unknown sickness( not 2us the veiwer LOL), and people with issues ya can identfy with. Yet, unlike other Z'flicks these are some really tough zombies. Faster, smarter, and flamable. Yahoo. This one would get my $1 recom. from a local dvd box thing i e redbox, Prime member, ect. I hope ya like it. I watch it once by myself and played it again for friends later in the same week for backgroud noise. My mistake because everybody watch the flick insted of planning the office x-mas party,lol ;-)"
3,ok..,"Movie wasn't as bad as a lot of reviews suggested. I'm watching zombie movies almost exclusively now and believe me, this one is ok."
3,Action packed!,"Ok! So, it's not a remake, and that's a good thing! For me it was entertaining from beginning to end! Everyone has an opinion and they are entitled to it. This is not the worse zombie film ever made and if you want to talk about real bad consider Zombie Diaries which was terrible beyond belief!The bluray of this film is outstanding in terms of picture and sound."
3,Good for Researching Early Lutheran Churches in America,"I found this book helpful for some research I was doing on Colonial Pennsylvania. I would not recommend it for general reading, unless you have an interest in the organization of the Lutheran church. It was short and spoke to early church leaders in America, as well as church organization."
4,"Not his best, but a must have for the completest.","That being said, the worst of Voltaire's work easily makes a mockery of what passes for the best of today's music - processed talentless, thoughtless, crap. He's pure genius. Definitely check out his older work as well; it's the cream of his career, and you'll be addicted."
3,Somewhat bored........,"I adore Voltaire and his overly genius sense of humor. I first got hooked when I bought Devil's Bris and from there I had to have more. When I got Boo Hoo my admiration slowed. He droned on incessantly with a alot songs almost slipping me into a coma. I do however love his cover of Bjork's ""Bachelorette"" and Tori's ""Caught a Lite Sneeze"". Overall this CD for me is only good on bleak days."
4,"Amusing at Points, not his best","This album has a few highlights on it, but generally is not as strong as Devil's Bris or Almost Human. I think of it as more of a transition album, because it holds some satirical songs like DB and AH, but also some downright silly ones like ""BRAINS!"" and ""Vampire Club"". And don't forget the Tori Amos cover of ""Caught a Lite Sneeze"". It's a bit shorter than the original, but I like Voltaire's version better."
1,Not actual records,"The coasters I received were imitation records. They had cheesy names like ""Tea Time"". They were not ""Cut from the center of recycled classic vinyl record labels. Hand-made from recycled vinyl records,"" as advertised."
3,A little misleading...,"I ordered the vintage vinyl coasters as a housewarming gift for my friend's new condo. I like the novelty idea of them being vintage vinyl records, but the artists they sent were no-namers -- or at least nobody popular that I knew. I thought they were going to be standard with record labels as shown on the picture, but they were hand picked albums of manufacturers choice. One of the coasters even had hand writing of a grammar school child on it marked with a name. I guess that's what makes it so ""vintage""? Regardless, I ended up choosing this product over the others because I didn't want random artist names who we didn't care about and thought this would be a more generic approach. I was wrong. Lesson learned."
1,Not for babies,"We sent this to our daughter for her 7 month old 20# baby boy, and she wrote this: ""So the bucket swing is, it turns out, meant for toddlers, not babies. We put him in, and he leaned forward, and was instantly horizontal! I tried facing him the other way, which worked for awhile, but then sure enough he flipped forward and almost over before I caught him. I went online, and it says its for kids 3-5, which is the MOST ridiculous thing I've ever heard of, because by 3 they are transitioning OUT of the bucket swings!!! I look at big sister (5) and looked at that swing and thought, wow, that's just dumb. I even looked at their full bucket, but its the same dimensions, which is basically that the link to attach the chain/rope to on the side is too small, and the edge of the bucket too low.""I'm very careful checking things out before ordering, and could find NO mention in the Amazon blurb of this being for kids 3-5. Instead, it does say 'Swing Baby Toddler' as a descriptor. Not true."
1,VERY VERY Bad - Dont Buy,Watch stopped working after 10 days. Tried to change the time and the thing just came apart. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.....VERY VERY BAD QUALITY. Only the looks are ok rest everything about this item is USELESS.
1,Stopped working after a week,I purchased this watch and after a week it stopped working. Extremely disappointed and a waste of my money.
5,Celtic Harp,I have enjoyed all of her music from the first time I heard her play. This album is beautiful. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enoys Celtic or harp music.
5,A huge step up from onboard video,"A local bestbuy store had these on sale.First I upgraded an eMachine, which had only onboard video.Wow, amazing what I had been missing .Next, I upgraded a homebuilt Gigabyte w/ built-in video, with this pci-e card.Finally I upgraded an intel D916GUX mobo with this video card and there wasagain, much joy thru out the household !"
2,reliable dealer,"the video card came in 6 days. I took a week to try it, but it was defective. I had a refund the day after i emailed them about the card."
3,"Broad coverage, seems accurate, but poorly organized.","This book superficially covers the operations of the commerce destroyers of the Confederate State Navy during the American Civil War. For an historical work, this book is poorly organized. It bounces all over the place when it should have maintained chronological order. Moreover, the events discussed appear to have occurred in limbo. There is very little attempt to place them in context with other events of the period. Coverage seems accurate, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more depth. Sources are first rate and the the work is well documented."
2,"Good overall coverage, not clear on details","Take this as a personal opinion: I needed this book for a project. It explains quite well the infrastructure, but when it comes to implementation you'll only need the source code that's online and your beloved MSDN CDs. I was expecting a clearer explanation on details, such as creating custom designers(which is a must if you're developing your own controls). The source code examples might be worth the price, therefore I don't regret this purchase... but I would have waited for some good Wrox title on this matter if I had to choose."
2,"Not very useful, unless you are new to Windows Forms","The book is for absolute novices. I haven't found anything of use for intermediate (and above) windows developers.Maybe my expectations were wrong, but I was looking for more of a best practices book."
3,user interfaces without richTextbox control?,"i still can't believe it--that anyone would write a comprehensive book on windows user interfaces and forget to mention the RichTextBox control. The author devoted 3 pages to the Textbox control, but said virtually nothing about one of the the most powerful text display controls.As said by another reviwer, there is nothing here on threading either. This book deserves 3 stars but no more because it is incomplete.That said, I still must commend the author for a well written book that flows from one chapter to the next.If you must get this book, bear in mind that you will have to look elsewhere to cover the omitted areas."
5,Good Stuff Maynard,"If you are following the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, this product is a staple. I have gone through a 5 pound bag of this almond flour each month for the past 3 months. I am thinking of ordering two bags at a time because it can be stored in the freezer. I find it works best in recipes when I sift it through a collander."
1,Broken bag! Terrible!,"I received this product today. I opened the box, and almond flour spilled out. The bag was already open! It's probably a health hazard to even use the flour. I am completely dissatisfied. I thought I was getting a good deal, but that ended up being $40 wasted."
5,excellent product,this helped me get over my fear of flying I would recommend it to anyone who is afraid to fly.
1,Horrible,"I had such high expectations for this ""Flightkit"" and it was the most awful remedy for fear of flying that I have heard. I would not recommend this to anyone trying to conquer their fear of flying! Give this kit a definite miss and try something else."
3,OK for dollhouse doll technique - but get some refinement,"I bought this book in the 80's and used the techniques to make dollhouse dolls for my daughters. Joanne McCracken's techniques are good for sculpting, and then reproducing, polymer clay miniature dolls, and on that basis I recommend the book.However - 20 years later I have re-opened the book, and I find the dolls shown not very refined in facial features. I still think it's a great book to get the dollhouse dollmaker on the path, but do get Maureen Carlson's excellent books and really learn to sculpt a face and figure in polymer clay if you need to start at the very beginning. Then combine the information in both authors' works for some great dollhouse people."
2,previous reviewer is accurate (but over zealous),"This is ""white noise"" static. You can get the same thing by tuning an off-air channel and recording the static. there is an occasional ""ting, ting...., ting"" like a wayward drop of water in the background to give it some illusion of rain but seems to be more like just static. Still it is long and can be put on a loop to drown out Hotel noises to sleep or as the other reviewer said airplane/airport noises. I had $2 it amazon credit to kill and this effectively killed it."
4,pop does have some talent,"i just bought the dulce beat live cd/dvdthe music and lyrics are good and creative, sound is good as welli think the singer needs some diafragm workand excercise to strengthen and perfect her great voice,as for stage presence they are getting their feet wetthere are some awkward moments of silence and dullnesbetween songs they need to learn how to reve up the publicsome more, and be more interactive with invited artistsbut all in all this is the begining of a great band they arefor real and most of the songs are sure hits this is not paulinapop, this band is a jem among alot of trash i recomend it if you likegood music"
1,very disturbing,"I awaited this book with much anticipation...and after reading it i felt like i needed a bath. It clearly shows what a minupulating person Paula Yates was. To have to sit and read the most intimate details of their relationship was to much, and with Paulas track record of lying, whats to say that any of this stuff was true. This book truly tarnishes the memory of Michael Hutchence, i wish i had never read it and i feel bad for Michaels family to have this trash out there. Unfortunately when you live your life in the public eye and you are no longer around to defend yourself, this is what happens...dont waste your money."
1,System Buster,This is absolute drivel. The book should qualify for the Guinness Book of records for the use of the word 'system'. Redundant to the max. Do not waste your money!
2,not impressive,"I found most of the songs on this album pretty dull, and standard '80's rock. But I *love* ""Smiling Islands"" and I am very glad to have in my CD library."
4,nice ring,this is the second one i bought for my boyfriend its a nice ring but still did not fit will have to try to buy him a bigger size but hey ill have the same ring now too because the first one i ordered did not fit him but it does me :)
4,"Good Milstein, mediocre accompaniment","Milstein sounds great for the most part, but not quite as good as some of his other recordings. The orchestras on the other hand go from mediocre to downright awful in some cases. I would recommend buying more famous recordings than these."
5,Best computer bag I could find,"I looked for a computer bag that could carry lots of papers and other necessities (I'm a college professor), along with my large notebook computer. I found exactly what I was looking for and more in High Sierra's AT147 computer case. In addition to the usual shoulder strap it has the capability to become a backpack, and along with the (many, many, many!) pockets, it has a padded computer insert with handles, which means that if I need more space I can carry the computer separately! The only feature it doesn't have which I'd like to see is an expansion zip, but then I'd probably overload it!If I could give this item 6 stars I would!"
3,"Creepy, but slow.","I didn't manage to finish this...it was just too slow. That said, I really enjoy Henry James use of language, his careful description, and the way he steps into the protagonists. At times, I very much felt the creepy that he intended.However--get to the point. Dan Brown isn't a fabulous writer, but he could teach James a few lessons about pacing."
4,Get Jazzed - Nice picks if you like smaller Tortex picks,Black Tortex picks with silver lettering.The Jazz picks are about 25% smaller than standard Tortex picks and have a more pronounced point.
5,Really Excellent...,"This is a very fine performance, recording of a great transcription by old papa Brahms. The whole four-handed series by Matthies & Kohn is highly recommended.The two works featured here seem to me to work very well as 4-handed transcriptions because of the nature of their original forms of string quintet & piano quartet. I have a few reservations about Brahms' 4-hand setting of his string quartets, because of the essential timbral nature of the string quartet form: it works so well for his quartets, that I'm afraid that something is lost in transcripton to piano 4-hands. Nevertheless, these two pieces work very well.Recorded sound is excellent."
4,A portrait of spiritual life in Taiwan,"I read this book in its unedited form, so it may have changed a bit since then, but I loved it. The picture it paints of life in Taiwan is moving and explicit, and the language and situations range from compassionate to humorous. The topic is academic but the langauge isn't, so it's appropriate for the general public as well as academians. I especially loved the section on the noodle vendor who ran an appeasement sideline. I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest, however passing, in Asian culture."
5,good book,this book really opened my eyes to the strange beliefs of some Taiwanese women. This book was a fun read and I recommend it to anybody who wants to learn more about Taiwan and the people there.
4,Another Gem from BBE's Hip Hop Producers series...,"First there was Jay Dee's ""Welcome to Detroit"", which had relatively played thug lyrics that were trashed by the masses. Yes, they weren't the best rhymes, but there were moments of multi-syllabic street-ness in them. With Pete Rock's ""Petestrumentals"" there are barely any vocals, most of this is simply Pete's beats. Jazzy stuff for the crate digging masses out there, this is great stuff to put on whether you're sitting back with a blunt after a hard day at work, or even to freestyle over. The MC's that do lay their vocals down on this are the collective known as the UN, and while there could have been more of them on this album, this is still a great look into Pete Rock's work, and what's even better is that it whets our appetites for the next full length solo from Pete. Well done, BBE, so far you're 2 for 2!"
4,It's the Soul Brother #1,"Pete Rock comes through on this vibey instrumental project for BBE's Beat Generation series. He lives up to his AKA as the Soul Brother because the material he presents here is soaked in soulful grooves and jazzy undertones. Only two tracks contain vocals but the rest of the album is immersed in Pete's aural treats. Some notable tracks are ""Hip Hopcrisy"" and ""the Boss"", but the choice cut here is ""Pete's Jazz"". Check the funk-laced, neck snapping bassline layered with a jazzy backdrop, it's fly. Cop it if you haven't already."
4,# 1 SOUL BROTHA,"My first taste of ""The Beat Generation"" was the Jay Dee - Welcome to Detriot release. Now my second taste is from ""THE #1 Soul Brotha"" Pete Rock. (I'm writing this as ""for the people"" plays in the background) You can't complete an alltime top 100 hip-hop list with out mentioning this kat. Besides making phat beats, Pete Rock makes tight music. Offering deep crate diggin jazz samples, this CD gives it to ya in raw, beats galore form. Some tracks can pretty much set the mood for anything, anywhere. Pete Rock is a GOD in the hip-hop underground world, on the levels of DJ Premiere of GangStarr and much respected too. Everytrack is banging and will put you in a head nodding hypnosis.Hip-Hop is still struggling in my opinion for real talent to show the true meaning of MC'ing. But until then, I'm cool with just listening to phat beats from kats like PeteRock, JayDEE, DjKrush, K&D and countless others. Besides, 95% of MC's ain't saying jack' anyway.Cop This CD....oNe"
4,GREAT disc of instrumentals to groove to,"People who can't recognize a groove bother me. They sit there and go, ""So uh, where's the melody."" JUST GROOVE, DAMMIT!! But I digress...""Petestrumentals"" is a great disc of mellow tracks to just throw on and sway to. A lot of underground producers lessen the impact of otherwise superb production by allowing subpar MCs to have mic time. Soul Brother #1 has been blessed by some of the nicest mic-rockers in hip-hop (Exhibit A: ""Soul Survivor""). I, however, am personally glad he gave them the day off. The result is a nice blend of beats, with a couple tracks laced by a group called the UN, I believe. They're alright, and they don't drag the tracks down.But this is Pete's show. And it's well worth the price of admission."
5,Exact Replacement For Factory,"Exact replacement for my broken factory units. Very easy to install. Price is amazingly low. I haven't placed a screw in the top cover yet, but I think I will soon. Cap snaps on but it seems like it would come off quite easily."
5,"Ventline V2049-01 White Plastic Plumbing Vent for 1-1/2"" Pipes","They should make these in a way (perhaps: bigger diameter) that allows you to slide them down over the base pedestal of the one you're replacing, leaving all of the old caulking intact. I'm hesitant to remove 'any' caulking from the roof, generally speaking, so, for now, this one has had its lower flange removed, and is glued to the remains of the old pedestal. None the less, it does what its advertised to do, hence the 5-star rating."
1,This is a bootleg,"Get the album Que Viva Mingus instead, on Dreyfus records, which is what I assume this is a copy of."
3,run-of-the-mill microwave,"It's hard to get excited about a microwave oven. Mine came with the apartment (new) and stopped functioning after 3 years. Because it's built into the cabinet, I have to buy the exact same one again, so that it'll fit the space. This model has a large turntable which is convenient for accomodating large plates. The sensor is not sensitive, so it is best to rely more on the timed cooking functions than on the sensor. Sometimes, using the sensor can cause your food to be too hot."
4,Crazy but effective!,"Staging a medieval fairy tale like ""Rusalka"" in modern dress is one of the craziest things I ever heard of. As Tolkien says, ""A fairy tale is not an allegory, it must be taken on its own terms."" Thanks to inspired to performances by a stellar cast, making this fairy tale into a modern allegory of betrayed innocence works. Fleming and Larin sing and act beautifully. Franz Hawalata's brilliant performance as the grumpy water goblin (Rusalka's father) is the glue that makes the performance hold together as a dramatic unity."
2,YES for Fleming - No for bizarre production!,"Another Eurotrash-production ruining a perfectly beautiful opera. With Renee Fleming today's most glorious Rusalka was filmed, sadly not even she can undo what the director did to this beautiful fairy tale."
4,"5 stars for singing, -1 for production","The singing is top drawer and the production is just not very interesting to me. Years ago, I saw Renee in a beautiful traditional production in San Diego and I kept wishing that this was a film of that production with these wonderful singers. I just ""didn't get"" the production at all. The acting and singing are certainly worth the price of this DVD, however, and I do recommend it if only for the performances. Renee is wonderful, but I have heard her sing her signature aria with more meaning at other times not to fault this rendering. The music is just gorgeous and diction not really understandable per my friend who speaks fluent Czeh but since I don't, it didn't bother me one bit. Subtitles are available. I recommend it for the music and the singing which is what opera is all about anyway! James Conlon can do no wrong in my little play book!"
4,Love this opera!,"I love this opera, though I am not certain that I love the modern interpretation. The voices they chose for this production are excellent, of course. I could listen to Reneé Fleming sing the moon song all day (and I may have done so at least once or twice). The sound is not the HD sound that I would like to hear, but it's not bad."
3,"Singing-5 stars,production-1 star","To be brief, this DVD is still worth buying for the great singing and sound quality. The production is terrible----- another example of cheap modern eurotrash.The whole ambience is cold, unlike the magical fantasy of the Met/ Vienna production which should be taped instead.It is cheaper than to buy the full CD set anyway. So just turn off the TV screen and enjoy !"
1,Ridiculous production,"I am a Professor of Music, who teaches an Introduction to Opera course. I recently saw the absolutely fabulous Met production of Rusalka with Renee Fleming--it was pure gold, as was she. This DVD, on the other hand, even her glorious singing cannot redeem. The production makes no sense whatever and destroys the magic of this beautiful fairy-tale opera. The only way to experience this DVD is with eyes closed--or, better still, not at all."
4,Grown up strawberry Bubblicious,"When I was a kid I loved Bubblicious gum, especially strawberry and watermelon flavors. So I was delighted when I found this gum. It gets 90% of the taste, but with no sugar. It's a no brainer for me.The trouble is, it's getting more and more difficult to find at retail. I get the impression Trident does not have much faith in it any more. Nonetheless, as long as Amazon keeps carrying it, it's all good."
3,INTERESTING READING BUT...,"The good point about this book is that it gives practical hints (although many are quite obvious) on organization issues, and therefore not only theoritical but for sure a practical approach on the topic for those needing so. However, I do agree with some other reviewer that points out the book is too much focused on CEO practices only (i.e., meaning you have assistants to delegate tasks)"
3,Interesting Themes But Lacks Originality,"Not having read any of Winston's books before I did not now what to expect. What I got was a book on how to handle my inbox, both physical and electronic and a guide to MBWA (Management By Wandering Around).Winston has some interesting methodologies for handling your daily task lists, a few were of value, but many were quite obvious and things that I had discovered in my own day-to-day work. Several concepts I had read or heard about from other sources, such as TRAF (Toss, Refer, Act, File for managing paperwork)Thematically I found the book interesting. Winston continually cites a CEO's focused attention and drive to handling requests immediately, as well as the power of the ""Gotta Second?"" encounter. I also did gain some insight as to why top management acts they was they do.If you are looking for a guide to managing your day-to-day tasks this may be a good fit. If you are looking for a more in depth study of the CEO psyche look elsewhere."
5,The Master!,"Stephanie proves once again, she's the master of her craft. More than helpful strategies, she also lets us peek inside the surprising world of the top executives, which was informative, surprising and fascinating.5 Thumbs Up for Ms. Winston!M. Macauley"
2,More of the same,"I am not even sure how I came to need this book so maybe I need an assistant...more of the same, hire some help and everyone has their own way of doing things so discover yours...thanks, I could have figured that out on my own. What is with all the self help books? I think the only people being helped are those that write and publish self help books. Are we really in this bad of shape as a society???"
3,Decidedly Ordinary,"You'll find no groundbreaking material in this book, though the initial premise is promising. On the positive side, the author provides a plentitude of real-world examples, by various named CEO's, of how they organize their tasks, their schedules, and their think-tank time. On the other hand, and perhaps this is inevitable in a study of this nature, a significant portion of the suggestions are what any ordinary study on time management would cite. The jacket cover refers to this book as a ""groundbreaking guide,"" but, alas, the groundbreaking has not yielded a sufficient number of nuggets for this reader to consider the expedition time well spent.The book is well organized, implying that the reader might pick this up as a library book and skim for suggestions relevant to the reader's particular need. Unfortunately, I highly doubt that any reader would return to this book for a refresher on what are mostly well known and often suggested techniques."
1,Pass this one by...,"This is a grossly simplistic look at TBI rehab. Just compare it to Mark Ylvisaker's ""Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation"" and you will realize that Clikeman's book was a completely wasted effort. Three years after a fairly comprehensive work is published, here we have someone wasting trees with a superficial treatment of the identical material."
5,i cant stop farting,i really like this song in particular. it really explains my whole life! i never thought that someone could bring it out like that. i would highly recomend this cd to anyone who has gas problems.
4,Research Paper,I needed to research the Smith-Hughes Act and this book covered it well. I got an A and a Bachelors Degree so it worked out well.
5,Understanding Grandchildren,"It is insightful to find out we can tell personalities in babies. And knowing your own personality and how to interact with other personalities makes it so much easier to raise great grandchildren. Wish I knew this when my own children were growing up. It makes a big difference in the level of self confidence and self esteem as one raises children, especially during the formative years of birth to age 3."
2,Not very satisfied,The item has scratch marks all over the place...I think they sent me the used one...I also did not like the cover...The Iron board seems like bouncing when I put pressure to iron something...
5,"""Game"" Goes to the Highest Level","I loved this book and couldn't put it down. Brenda Webster 's modern take on the fable of Gawain and the Green Knight creates a contemporary world just as intense, dangerous, and exhilarating as any medieval swashbuckler. The characters are well-drawn and their relationships believable.Like Ren and Jack, many gay couples even today struggle with how ""out"" one is compared to the other. ""The Beheading Game"" explores this personal issue with sensitivity and insight, and it plays out just as heart-wrenchingly as it did in ""Brokeback Mountain."" But Webster also dramatically weaves in bigger issues that both men have to battle individually, and more importantly, together. The theatre and hospital scenes are some of the most compelling literature I have ever read."
2,Gary Who?,"Alrighty then.Mr Barlow and co. have finally seen the light, the tail lights of Robbies train. ""OI!,"" Gary said ""I should round up the boys and we could make some lucre off this Robbie bloke!""How sad MR. Barlow, how f&*(#$g sad.I have heard most of this album and think that it sounds great, for a new Robbie Williams cd. Didn't like Rudebox? Well Gary and the boys are here for ya.If this CD does make it in America, it will be because Mr. Williams has primed the market for some two-bit hacks to step in and steal his spotlight.TAKE THAT!"
2,The Sominex Album,"Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing that stands out. Go to Starbucks and get a Grande so you can stay awake when you listen to this album. I have tickets to AKUS current tour and I hope there are not many cuts from this album in their concert."
3,Frustrated again,Another sweet recording from one of the most talented individuals anywhere. Will someone please show the door to the musicians who continue to ruin the beautiful and trancendant nature of Ms. Krauss' gorgeous work with what can only be referred to as hillbilly hoedown tracks. I will not buy another album that exhibits such a dramatic dual personality. Unfortunately it has become the norm from Ms. Krauss and one must assume she has artistic control of albums bearing her name.
2,repeat of the same,"Ever since Jerry Douglas has returned to the group, AKUS has had the same repetitive sound of music to go to sleep by. Someone needs to light a fire under Douglas' and Krauss' bottom, and get things shaking again!Dont waste your time and money on this one ....there are alot better Bluegrass CDs to hear and enjoy."
4,"Great, relaxing music","Lonely Runs Both Ways is now one of my favorite new cds to listen to. It's so relaxing, and Alison Krauss's voice is almost haunting, it's so pure. I love this cd!"
5,Great Album,"I bought this album for my boyfriend for Christmas because part of his gift was a ticket to see her in concert on the ""Lonely Runs Both Ways"" tour. I am a huge fan of her Live CD and wanted to be familiar with the new music we were going to hear. i listened to it some before the show but after attending her show on Jan. 21 I love this album even more. She has amazing talent and along with a miraculous bunch of musicians they sound like a dream. This album to me is just as good as all others. It is somewhat slower than some past numbers but the quality is no less. Anyone AK fan would be silly not to purchase this album."
4,Classic Krauss and Union Sta.,Her haunting voice always pleases and does not fail here. I enjoy her style and that of Union Sation but sometimes I am mystified that the two sometimes seem so different on the same album.
4,A Gathering Of Talents,"This offering from AKUS again displays an incredible combination of expert musicianship and flawless vocals. Excellent deep and moody production on, ""If I Didn't Know Any Better"". The distinctive sound of Jerry Douglas's dobro sometimes begins to overwhelm the mix and distract from the vocal songs, but shines masterfully on instrumentals like, ""Unionhouse Branch""."
4,Smooth listening,"This album showcases the pure musicianship of Allison Krauss and Union Station. Unionhouse Branch is an instrumental tune which displays this musicianship. Although there are some bluegrass inspired tunes, this album has some easy feeling tunes that any appreciator of fine music would love.As you enjoy this album, you will listen to the musical storytelling of Dan Tyminski on songs such as Pastures of Plenty and to the jaunty tune I Don't Have to Live This Way"", sung by Ron Block. Most of the songs are sung by Allison Krauss. Restless has been played on CMT, but the next to the last song on the album, If I Didn't Know Any Better, is in my opinion the most beautiful song here.The only drawback I have with this album is that the lyrics are printed in the liner notes. For me, that is one of the best parts of enjoying this music. Perhaps they will return to printing the lyrics in future albums.I would recommend this album to anyone wanting to experience some fine country music."
4,music,Allison Krauss is so easy to listen to. Union Station band is very talented. Perfect pitch and perfect harmony. Recommended.
5,Need more stars..,"I need ten stars for this one,not only five. Stellar. Listening to it day and night for weeks now. Still not tired of it. Buy it."
4,Gets better every time you hear it,"First time I heard it I thought it was kinda average except for the more upbeat bluegrass tunes and the instrumental ""Unionhouse Branch"" which so far is my favorite piece on this album. But each time I listen, I enjoy the whole album more and more. On the songs that Alison sings, you have to listen for the all the subtleties...all the ""colors"" in the music. Pretty soon you've got yourself a rainbow. To appreciate this album your ears need to really drink it all in....over and over."
3,Boring. Difficult to understand words,"The songs are all flawlessly performed with the typical Union Station sound anyone familiar with Alison Krauss would recognize. But the songs seem uninspired;they are irrelevant to my life, well written, but irrelevant. Worst, it is really difficult to understand the words; I had to read the lyrics as she sang. I hope she does not go the Emmylou Harris route of intentionally mumbling. There seems to be a lot of dobro."
3,A step down,"Maybe it's because AKUS had no chance of topping New Favorite or their Live album, but Lonely didn't hit the mark. Restless is a very powerful and wonderful song, as is a Living Prayer. The rest seem like filler. I will give full marks for their musical quality, using violas in place of fiddles on song tracks. That was innovative. I also feel Dan and Ron weren't allowed to let loose on this album. The Guthrie cover was average, as was I Don't Have to Live This Way. Maybe they need Adam Steffey back (best mandolin player in the world)."
5,"I don't care what anyone says, Alison is wonderful!","Her voice is like honey and I never get tired of listening to Alison and her talented band. There are some great songs on this album, I can't think of anyone who has a better voice than Alison Krauss."
2,Sadly disappointed,"From all the reviews, I expected that this was going to knock me off my feet. But instead, it bored me. Unlike the So Long, So Wrong CD (which did) this one lacked the WOW factor for me. It just didn't move me at all."
5,Incredible Talent,"I have often thought that the reason music recorded 30 even 40 years ago remains so popular is because there is so little talent in the recording industry today. Alison Krauss and Union Station are the exception to my opinion. This CD contains some of the best (if not the best) talent in the entertainment industry. AKUS doesn't need to depend on computers or voice enhancements to make their music sound so incredible. They aren't flashy - they are just incredibly talented singers, songwriters and musicians. If you are tired of ""corporate music"" in the world of pop,rock and country, AKUS will be a breath of fresh air. Krauss especially shows her talent in song #15 - A Living Prayer. When you hear it you will know what I mean. I first heard AKUS when traveling in a U-Haul through the western part of Virginia and immediately fell in love with their sound - this CD is one of their best."
5,Lonely runs both ways,"Great C.D.! Union Station has very talented musicians and Alison Krauss, as usual, is flawless."
3,Good CD....but not the best one they have done.,"I love the band, Dan, Ron, and Barry...they are all great musicians! Alisons voice is angelic. I really liked it when Alison sang bluegrass though. All of the vocals that she sings are sweet, breathy songs. The rest of the CD is hard driving Bluegrass. Hardly goes together. Just my humble opinion."
4,Another Winner,"Many years ago after a band gig an audience member gave me a cassette and told me to ""check this gal out, you'll like her"". Turned out to be a copy of her first album and I've been a big fan ever since.This is a good CD. Lots of breathy beautiful vocals, and a great treatment of Del McCoury's ""Rain Go Away"". Their version is a virtual textbook of how to play a hard core bluegrass number.Another cool thing is the way Alison does the backbeat chops usually done by the mandolin, on the fiddle. Sounds perfect.My main criteria in evaluating a song is if it makes me smile. I did a lot of smiling while I listened to this album.Terence KennedyAlexandria Minnesota"
5,I LOVE this record!,"I love this record, and I love the fact that Alison and the guys know where there talent lies. They never pretend to be something they're not. Any record of theirs is going to be your favorite. There is not a song on this record that I don't like. If you like this one, try their new one ""A Hundred Miles or More"". Same goes for that one. Very few singers in my experience are as good as Alison, so if you want to listen to music at it's purist, this is the record for you."
4,Love it,"I love Alison Krauss and the Union Station but hadn't picked up anything from her recently. I was not disappointed. If you are in to her music, buy this."
4,Son Loves It!!!,I purchased this for my son who has a grandma that raises chickens. He loves being around them and this was a perfect replacement to have at home. Very durable plush and would certainly buy again in a heart beat.
1,not as shown in picture- dont be taken in...,"very disappointed with this product when it arrived as nothing like the picture. it was bright orange, very flimsy and only had 6 small grips on the bottom as opposed to the 10 on the pictured item. also the sizing stated on the packaging i received leads me to believe the small and extra large i had purchased as suitable for most shoes (between them) would not have actually worked. i wont find out because they are going back tomorrow!not like Amazon to give such miseading info"
1,Not as pictured!!!,"We received an bright orange last decade model with only 6 spikes in a much different formation. We ordered small, maybe the XL is black?"
1,do not buy,"I have the Grip ons and have only worn them 3 times, each time I have slipped on the ice. I do not feel secure at all walking on icy sidewalks. Also in that time they seem to have worn down and I lost a spike already. I walk on sidewalks for those that wonder. I also have Get a grip spikes which is much better."
3,These gripons are made for walking,"Don't attempt to run in these because they can fail to provide traction at high speed, but otherwise they are an easy way to walk on ice. They don't snag carpet and they are fairly easy to drive in. I've worn them for a few weeks and they aren't showing any signs of wear yet. Muddy snow can be messy if it gets stuck between the gripon and the shoe though."
1,These broke,"I tried to use them and the first time I put them on, one of them broke when trying to put it on. It was worthless. I do not recommend buying these."
5,one legged protection,Bought these for a family member that recently had a prosthetic leg. He had a slip and fall in the driveway.Now he doesn't slip or fall. He loves them.Great investment for peace of mind.
5,Exceeds your expectation,I live in Ohio with a very steep driveway so I was looking for something easy to put on/take off and that had great traction - this is a great and low cost product. I highly recommend it.
2,Not good for running,"The product does not stay centered on your shoe while running. The forefoot traction pad migrates to the inside or outside of the foot, which causes an improper foot strike, resulting in stress to the knee, ankle, shin, or other tendons. I don't recommend them for running, but they probably work well for walking. After one run, I returned the product. Amazon graciously accepted the return."
4,They seem to be working,"I wasn't expecting these to be great but so far I'm satisfied. I bought and liked the Stabilicers Lites, they had great grip, but they suffer from same problem as Yak Traks; they won't stay on the shoe and come off on crust or trails. I think manufacturers want you to lose foot grips the way most are designed. That's why I'm giving a thumbs up to the DryGuy GripOns, they actually stay on because they have an over the toe design and the rear straps rides high onto the shoe. I'm wearing these on some Acton Canadian Snow boots and so far so good. The rubber material is wide and flat and I think this is part of the reason they are staying on. I believe these were actually less expensive than the Stabilicers that I won't buy again."
5,GripOns,The DryGuy GripOns were for friends in Ukraine. They were thrilled. They work well on snow and ice. Very economical. I ended up buying several more pairs for their friends.
3,Seem to work pretty well.,I have only had the chance to use these once but I feel they did a good job. The only problem I had was getting them on and off of my shoes. I solved the problem by putting them on one pair of shoes and leaving them on that pair. I took another pair of shoes to work with me to change into. So I only have to change shoes and not have to struggle with the GripOns.
1,Now What,"My husband bought these in late feb 2010. Put them on a dedicated pair of shoes but never got to use them remainder of winter. While organizing closet i noticed the rubber had broken in half at the heel location on 1 of the shoes. Pourous maybe? Can't return, can't use...Now What. 1st time not satisfied with an Amazon product..."
4,Stayed on for an HOUR!,"Grips are great for walking, not hiking. If you need great hikers, buy Yaktrax."
5,"A great book, will challenge views on marriage and divorce","Craig investigates the history of divorce and remarriage theology, and talks about the current divorce crisis of today. He argues that our ""contract"" perspective on marriage (if you don't fulfill your part of the bargain, I can leave) is in opposition to God's model of covenant (no matter what you do, I'm committed for life)."
1,Not worth it....,"Bought this online due to the price and the manufacturer. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well. Lots of smearing, blurring, and ghosting of the picture when you go to higher resolutions. Apparently didn't shield it very well. Anyway, get the Microsoft one. It worked fine."
1,BAD CABLE,"Unfortunately my gaming buddy informed me that there is no difference in cables so I bought the MAD CATZ VGA cable to save some money....IT COST ME DEARLY....THE SHADOWING IS UNGODLY!!!! It makes my Samsung 226BW 22inch LCD look like a blue light special. CB,if you are reading this...a subsidy is in order...I WANT THE MS version!!!! Buyer Beware...they are 15 bucks for a reason."
4,Mingus without Mingus,"This is a recording made after Mingus was already sick and unable to play his instrument. I once borrowed the vinyl copy from a library and copied it on a cassette. As I remember the liner notes, Mingus was present at the recording sessions, but was only able to offer the most minimal of directions or advice. Still this is presented as his recording.Nevertheless, the music is terrific. It features an extended big band made up of a large number of Mingus alumni, and the music alternates between solo excursions for almost everyone, and ensemble free blowing interludes.It's terrific music."
3,Pilgrim's review,"This CD was ok, The CD's with Coltrane and Hartman and Live in Tokyo should be purchased first."
2,"hamster escaped, seller wasn't origianly willing to accept return","Arrived quickly. It was a pain in the you know what to put together. Hamster escaped 2 times in 5minutes. Seller said since it was ""used"" wouldn't accept a return. Took about a week and numorous attempts on my part to at least get the 30% back or whatever was offered in their return policy list."
3,Hamster Cage,"Received item as described. The tubes are a little difficult to assemble, but not impossible. Our two hamsters love it."
5,Taste GREAT,"Usually buy these from a local merchant, but getting enough to make several holiday gifts is expensive, so we wanted to order in bulk. These arrived on time and tasted great!"
5,The best foodstuff you'll ever find!!!!!,"My wife and I fell in love with chocolate covered gummi bears about 5 years ago. We used to buy them from the local candy store but then we wanted to have them as part of the treat boxes on the tables at our wedding a year ago. At the local candy store price, that was a bit expensive. So we ordered bulk of these well before the wedding so we could make sure the quality was similar... we ended up having to order more before the wedding because the quality was the best so we ate too many ourselves!"
5,Gummy Bears!,"I decided to try these because I came across them in a local candy store, which they can be a little expensive... These taste just as great! Came very fast and in great shape! They're deicious and I have no complaints about the product itself! Good buy."
3,TheRealTruth,"It's kinda pricey but it's a gift for one of my sisters and I don't know why chocolate covered gummy bears are always kinda pricey. Anyways, there is plenty of chocolate covering the bears. I think they came looking a little on the white side... meaning I'm thinking they were old or melted at one point but the flavor was still good. I'd buy it again if it went on sale or something."
5,everything you ever wanted to know about Mexico and didn't ask before,"Julie Preston and Samuel Dillon have written a wonderfully researched and thorough look at Mexico's politics that anyone could read, understand, and learn from. They have used the stories of real people to bring to life the complex problems of the country and at the same time described the sweeping changes that the country has undergone. I read this book as preparation for moving to Merida in the Yucatan peninsula. I feel that I can appreciate the current political discussions and events much better thanks to the background that the book provided."
2,Not hypoallergenic,These gloves are made of Nyplex which may be hypoallergenic but the lining is what makes your hands itch.
5,Why aren't my favorite cleaning gloves available??,"Mr. Clean Nyplex Latex Free Household Gloves are THE BEST cleaning ""buddies"" EVER! (My glove size is Medium and I would like to purchase a pack of six pair) They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time due to their soft lining and the fit and grip of the glove is excellent ~ above average. I used to be able to purchase them at local grocery stores, Walmart, Lowe's, etc. Lately, the only thing available is the cheap latex gloves that stink and irritate my hands. I have searched on line and the product comes up, but states that it is sold out, unavailable or may not be available. I want to know why AND if this product is no longer being made in Thailand, is there a similar glove made in the USA.If not...why not, Mr. Clean!!! MsHub"
5,salad serving set on stand,"Great product, especially if you entertain ! Well made and attractive and it frees up space on the table or sideboard buffet for other dishes. The bowl is quite large and the wooden finish is beautiful. I bought 3 of these. One for myself and 2 others as gifts."
4,Great Book,Great Book! Very informative for a new church nursery. Everything is in there you need and some you have not even thought of. Easy reading and understandable. Must have for any church nursery.
3,Printer,every printer needs two things to work. Paper and INK (four if you count having a connection to a computer and power)
1,Cartridge was defective,"I purchased this through Amazon. It did not work when I installed it. I tried everything on my printer - cleaning the heads, etc. Finally decided it was defective and bought another one at Target and it worked fine. I sent this one back and Amazon gave me a full refund. It was a very easy process to return it."
1,"Good product, bad price",This is a great product the the price here is more than twice what you can find it for elsewhere. My advice is to keep looking.
3,it was ok,"it arrived late and didnt really know when it was going to get here, but it did get here about 5 days late"
3,A bit outdated,"When we received the cartridge is was outdated almost a year, but it still worked good, better than the Cartridge World refills that we bought that would not work in the HP printer."
5,This atlas is worth considering....,"Just as said - the type is much larger and therefore very readable. Also, the detail is great and the price was extremely reasonable."
5,No More in-Car Arguments!,"I won't claim that this atlas saved my marriage, but it sure cut down on fights in the car. He's the driver, I'm the navigator, and now that I have a map that I can actually read, we get to where we're going in peace. Sort of."
1,hard to get a good overview of a trip,"This atlas shows very few states on a single spread, so you have to constantly flip between different pages when trying to plan a route. I found this very infuriating during a recent road trip in New England. It was always a hassle when we had to pull the map out because there was so much page turning."
1,narcissistic ramblings,I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello but not of his new album.The first thing that bugs me is how he just keeps using the vibrato in his voice. It's as if he thinks the more he usesit the more feeling he's emoting. It work the opposite with me....if the songs had any substance he wouldn't have to try to dress them up with the endless vibrato he uses.Another thing is that the songs are virtually indistinguishable from each other.....apparantly he has found a new love in his life but it might have just as well been he was diagnosed with some bad disease.....there is no joy here. His chord changes on many of the songs seem forced and disingenuous...like he's tryingto do something artistic. As I mentioned I think he is a tremendous artist but I feel I wasted my money on this disc...if I had sampled it first I never would've purchased it.....
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz.....,"(2 & 1/2 stars) After Elvis Costello got romantically involved with Diana Krall (sending males around the planet into despondency), he's apparently gone all soft and mushy. The songs on North are very slow and boring, completely devoid of any of the zest he showed on his last ""rock"" CD. I had a premonition of trouble when I saw that this disc is on the distinguished CLASSICAL label Deutsche Grammophon. That also prompted negative flashbacks to EC's equally dull disc with the Brodsky Quartet a decade ago. The arrangements on these songs are classy and well played by the musicians, especially Stieve Nieve on piano, but the songs themselves are nearly all just lifeless. About the only exception is ""Still,"" which would only be an average song on one of his better CDs. I could act all superior and pretend I like North, but instead I'm gonna be honest and suggest you avoid it unless you're having trouble sleeping."
3,Bitter is Better,"It's Elvis, so I can't bring myself to go below three stars. Fact of the matter is Elvis is much more interesting when he's angry and bitter. There's nothing memorable here, but the good news is you can now pick up a copy of the re-released ""Get Happy""."
2,Selfish promotion of new love and loss of old one,"Some of the songs speak of love but Elvis is a big boy so I hope he is really sincere. The songs are okay-some are childish at bestIf I were the present object of Costello's affections I probably would be extremely flattered by his songs devoted to his love for me but I would also question if I were in the music biz myself if the nameless, faceless expression of love in North was partly promotion to sell music."
2,Go Bananas instead!,"I just bought Elvis' latest album North, along with Deep Purple's latest album, Bananas (import) and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience.Two of my favorite artists seem to be going in different directions and I'm not talking musical. I can't believe how awful North is, the music lacks spark and the songs simply aren't that good or memorable. The arrangements are typical been there done that and Elvis just doesn't sound like he`s having fun! When the disc ended I knew I wouldn't be in a hurry to play it again any time soon.On the contrary, Deep Purple's new album is everything Elvis' isn't. Great songs, unbelievable performances and the band sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the running order of the album is just outstanding. I've played Bananas10 times as much as North.It's safe to say this is not Costello's finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple's.Two stars: NorthFive stars: Bananas"
4,I concur...,"...with the reviewer who said that if there were anything that could possibly improve this terrific CD, it would be that a few arrangements were a bit livelier. Otherwise it's perfect as is.""Let me tell you about her"" (which I've been humming around the house.) and ""Fallen"" are among my favorites. I hear the next CD will be a rocker. This sort of musical variety should be encouraged and supported. Elvis Costello is a musical treasure. I'd like to see more diversity on one CD."
2,Ronf Ronf Ronf,"in italian ronf-ronf stands for the sleeping snore. That is what I felt the first time I listened to this CD. I'm s huge Costello's fan and I appreciate the Elvis versatility and also the bravery to afford a music so sophisticated like Carmichael or other, but I prefer him with his Gretche guitar. Good packaging and words. Maybe the more I listened to it the more I could appreciate, maybe."
3,elvis in love,"If you liked ""The Juliette Letters and ""Painted with Memories"" and various tracks off of different albums when elvis is in heavy ballad mode you will enjoy this record. It suffers from a sameness of melody or mood a few uptempo or moderate tempo tunes would have balanced out the slow droning flavor of the lp. If you listen closely elvis does come close to the masters he emulates lyrically .For elvis lp fans only"
4,Elvis sings his life to the world,"Elvis continues to mature as a performer and song writer. His songs continue to show his life in full view. My heart breaks for him in the opening songs and then you feel the turn and viola, he's in love and he is his sentimental self again. Lovely ballads, awesome lyrics, and fantastic vocals. Can we have some more rock in the future??"
4,give it time....,"....and you'll love it. i'm a huge EC fan, but this album kind of annoyed me at first. just too mellow. the only tunes that jumped out at me initially were ""still"" (an absolute stunner) and ""someone took the words away"" (even better), and i had to send out search parties to find the melody in (seemingly) dirge-like numbers like ""when did i stop dreaming"" or ""fallen"". but, after about a week or so of listening, the intricate beauty -- and, yes, sturdy melodies -- of these fragile songs bloomed into full flower. head ""north"", folks -- it's a great trip."
5,Someone Took The Words Away,Let's hope no one every takes the words away (Someone Took The Words Away) from Elvis Costello. The world is a much better place with albums like this one. The music says it all. Thanks Mr. Costello for another great release.
4,just keeps makin solid songs,"As always, Elvis Costello proves to be a brilliant song writer and musician. Whatever song you want, soft and mellow or rocking and up beat, Elvis has it. This cd adds to his mellow collection but at the same time its very powerful. And...as an added bonus, when you buy the cd you get a PIN code to get an extra song - the title track, North."
5,Honest Tenderness,"I've listened to this album probably fifty times now. And I can't wait to listen again. What is it about Elvis? Why aren't there more artists like him?Okay, the review part. Best song: Can you be True? Low point: When Green Eyes Turn Blue (so far, I just can't get into this one . . .)The album: Sounds kind of like jazzy standards (think . . . ahem . . . Diana Krall?), but with a decidedly Elvis touch. The lyrics are great, his voice is pure, and for the most part the arrangements are wonderfully economical - when flourishes do appear they seem to detract from the intimacy that characterizes this album. Great transistions from minor to major, no guitars - 'though Elvis plays piano on a few songs. The album isn't perfect - some songs get a bit too 'cabaret' - but all in all, five stars."
4,Stands up to teenage boy,"My son plays trumpet in his high school marching band. He's not the most delicate creature when it comes to handling his possessions. He announced last year that he was required to have this gizmo for holding the music on his trumpet. I was concerned because it looked like fragile plastic, assuming I would be replacing it every month or so. He used it through the heaviest performance season of last year and has begun this new school year with it still intact. I'm impressed! I would recommend this product and would make the same purchase again."
5,Great Item,Wonderful Seller. Received the item on time and just what I ordered. It works great. My middle schooler has it on her trumpet holds her music prefectly and at the correct height so she can see it with no problems.
5,The Grave Yard Shift,"This book has so much great information and history. It is sad to read as it tells how so many bodies were move from 1 cemetery to another and then maybe another. We loose track of where a relative is buried, but the book has great resources."
4,Comprehensive Resource,"Terrific, comprehensive resource for the genealogist in the NY/NJ area.Well written text includes addresses and phone numbers, years of use, and informative history of the local cemeteries."
1,I sent it back.,"Amazon has a very good, reliable return system. I needed it for this book. It is as dry as bones! This book is only for people who actually want to see graves in New York City and who are actually there. There are no illustrations or descriptions at all."
4,Adult Coloring Book,Great coloring book. I bought it for an adult friend of mine who enjoys coloring and she loved it!
2,Coloring Book,"Not what I expected, I love butterflies and only one was included, but nevertheless, I love to color it relaxes my mind and relieves stress..."
4,A real page turner!,"Not being a fan of romance novels, I hesitated purchasing this book. But wanting to support a fellow ""hometown author"" who had supported my writing endeavors (God's Noggin Nudgers - Those Times God Has To Slap Us Upside The Head To Get Our Attention), I opted to expand my horizons and open my mind to a potential adventure. What an adventure it was! I couldn't wait to see what for perdicament the lead character would find herself in next. This book went beyond the typical love story between a man and a woman. It also showed how love can be expressed between a parent and child, a co-worker, a teacher and student, and a land-lady that most would view as more than slightly annoying. The even more important quality of the book was how the author put God at the center of each of these relationships and how those relationships took on a whole new level as a result. Nothing more that I can say but - Good Stuff!!"
5,Gift,Bought this item especially for my daughter-in-law after the first child was born. It has been an added need for her to give the children the best care.
2,not what was expected,Book came in decent shape was a little more wore then other books with the same condition description. It was not the book that it is raved about to be so it sits on the shelf.
4,A Great Study into the trial of Jesus,"A fascinating sight-seeing tour of all the facts known about the trial of Jesus of Nazareth. The book is intended to be a guide for individual and group studies, and to be helpfil to all wanting to know more about the trial of Jesus. Written by a Harvard-trained attorney.A"
4,TRACK LISTING IN ERROR AND LACKING INFORMATION:,"I have this cd single with the UPC of 0602498108987 and when I enter it into the search engine on Amazon, I get this page. The track listing is missing information pertaining to what type of version they are or any guest artists. Finally, the track listing does not mention that there is a video track as well.Here is the track listing with guest artist and remix information plus the missing track:1. Love @ 1st Sight (f/ Method Man)2. Love @ 1st Sight (Richi Rich Vocal Remix)3. Your Child (Remix f/ Ghostface)4. Love @ 1st Sight (Video)"
4,Mountain of Truth,"""Paradise Hotel"" is a good disc. Mark Hallman, who has produced some excellent music such asOne Thing Rightby Matt the Electrician, guides this project. My favorites come about two-thirds through the set. ""Is It Like Today"" has a haunting melody and lyric with Rich Brotherton's mandolin providing instrumental depth, ""He says how could it come to this; I'm really worried about my creation."" Eliza's ""Think About You"" has Mark on harmony vocals with a wistful soft melody, ""I'm a sucker for the fountain of youth til I bang my head on a mountain of truth."" The set concludes with a strong track, ""When You Walk On,"" a positive embrace of the ups & downs of life, ""You may grasp at the illusion, the confusion of your mind, but soon you will remember to surrender one more time."" Other tracks like the political ""Man of God,"" ""Jedidiah 1777"" and the Spanish track ""Bellarosa"" are all beautiful. This is a strong disc. Enjoy!"
4,Man of God.,"The record would deserve five stars, but ""Man of God"" is only a political rant with no base upon reality. The U.S.A. is in a war that Ms. Gilkyson may not like, but at least from our part it is not religious."
1,Thank heavens I only borrowed it from the library!,"I had great hopes for this book, but was very disappointed. The reviews are for the most mixed bag of movies I have ever seen. Non-fiction mixed with fiction. Very old, unrelated movies (such as The Court Jester with Danny Kaye) panned and mixed in with new releases for no reason. The parent/child review format would seem to make sense, but the comments of ""wouldn't want to see it again"" or ""enjoyed it"" were not very helpful. Disturbing to me was the list of recommended movies for teens. I have a hard time putting ""Something About Mary"" on a recommended list for my soon-to-be 13 year old daughter. The author seemed to be a fan of certain actors and included their movies, not caring about a movie's individual merit. This is not a book to be put on the family bookshelf. Try Nell Minow's."
1,Horrible! Skip it!,"This has to be the lousiest Rheingold on dvd! Do not waste your time! It took me two weeks to get through it, and even then I put it on the computer as I answer emails, but when I couldn't take much more, I would take a break.The singing is OKAY but that's it. No stand outs. Still I would rate it higher if I just judged the singing. The production is the pits! One set for the entire thing, and it is an ugly set. Nothing makes sense. Alberich holds a mirror and that's supposed to mean he's invisible and then he holds up his arms to become the dragon and tears a stuffed bunny in half.I am not against postmodern productions, but this one was a director sticking the middle finger at the audience. No ideas or dumb ideas. If you want a postmodern Rheingold, get the Copenhagen one. That is much better than this."
5,Funny as Hell,"I read this book with my grrlfriend and we found oursleves laughing so much that we would have to stop reading to control ourselves. This book tackles every stereotype out there and makes it funny, from that ever so popular 'pasty vegan' color to the road signs in the back. I recommend buying at least two copies of this book, one for yrself, and one for yr closest friend, they will love you forever."
4,Very entertaining,This book was way worth the money. My friend and I both read it and many times laughed out loud at the clever remarks and anecdotes. This was recommended to me from someone else and I'm so glad I bought the book. Very funny discussion of the Far Right Christian worriers.
2,"Sometimes funny, but...","This book is funny sometimes, especially the flow chart and the ads, and it begins humorously enough. The hair thing, though somewhat recycled, made me chuckle.The thing is, it becomes a very Negative book, and left me feeling disenchanted and sad at the end. The author seems to have a very set ideal of what people should act, seem, and look like, and ends up abandoning most of the reader base that picked it up to read it to begin with.I don't recommend buying this book at full price. I'd suggest a Very inexpensive, used copy."
4,excellent,Excellent but advanced and highly technical. I would not recommend it for recently graduated practicians.
3,"Fun, but Funny? Not really.","Shannon's book is basically a glorified screen play. Several reviews called it funny (I did not laugh much). I enjoyed the characters and the story--even it is all a bit absurd. It plays out like a decent action thriller and some the hits it puts on the movie making business are solid. The characters are not very deep and the end, while satisyfing, is not particularly surprising. Fun, but not much depth--could acutally make a better movie than book...go believe."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See book summary above.It seems everyone gets their due in this novel. The bad guys and the reader. A highly satisfying read. I'm highly curious who Ray Shannon really is (it's a pseudonym), because I'm willing to bet he/she is a well known author.This was a fast moving entertaining ride. If there was a little more humor thrown in it would definitely rate a five.Highly recommended."
3,"fascinating topic, only adequate coverage","Scotland's miserable failure to establish a colony in Panama in the 1690's should make a gripping story, but Prebble can't manage any narrative flow, or track his many characters coherently. There is too little time spent on the colony itself, and too much time spent on political and financial machinations in Edinburgh and London. The book begins with a hanging in 1705 and then backtracks, so that the whole book is a flashback, which is a tired old mechanism anyway, and at the end of the book it is revealed that the hanging episode had almost no connection to the Darien story. The story could have been told much more fluidly."
3,Dry but informative history,"Ultimately, this is a well done history of the little known Scottish endeavor to colonize Panama during the late 17th and early 18th centuries and the trials and tribulations that eventually lead to the abject failure and the personalities involved. The hardcover includes multiple inset glossy images or portraits and a few maps to help the reader identify with the personalities and locale.While I found this to be dry leaning toward arid at times and punctuated with brief areas of interest, the overall story was well worth the read. If you have a national interest in Scotland or a thirst for the history of the colonial efforts in the western hemisphere this is an interesting bit of history. Most will find it to be a slow read and require perseverance to finish though. P-)"
5,I Capuleti e it Metechhi/Larmore,"Jennifer Larmore's magnificent, dusky mezzo-soprano voice is an instrument of perfection, as always, and Hei Kyung Hong, with whom Larmore often collaborates, is excellent. A real treat!!"
1,This Should Have Been Really A Lot Better!,"How did this book get published? I really do wonder. The author's picks of the H.P. Lovecraft movies he writes in depth on is often really off the wall -- WITCH-HUNT? THE TROLLENBERG TERROR?? CTHULHU MANSION??? He seems to think mentioning ""Arkham"" or the ""Necronomicon"" makes a movie Lovecraftian, while ignoring other movies which really use HPL's ""cosmic horror"".Also there are dumb claims such as saying THE RELIC's ""Kothoga"" creature (a human turned into a combination of mammalian, reptilian and insect monster by a plant) was somehow based on August Derleth's ""Cthugha"" (a fire elemental that appears as a large ball of flames). I mean, really!Somehow this really too expensive book is summed up for me by the author's having used a amateurish drawing by his wife for the book's frontpiece. That this book seems intended for academics is beyond my understanding. Man, if they read only this, they are really going to be misinformed!"
3,Nice paperweight,"This was the text for my introductory composition course. The authors discuss methods for inventing and improving arguments with rhetoric, grammar, and other points of style. They write well and with authority on the subject. However, that material totals about 100 pages; the bulk of this 864 page brick is filler, primarily essays pulled from other publications and some student essays (their addition being the main apparent addition over the first edition) that weren't worth being published in the first place. For instructors' purposes, the text offers numerous activities and MLA/APA guides, but nothing that couldn't be found in shorter and more detailed books."
3,Great book until it fell apart...,"So far this term we've just been in the beginning chapters, as soon as we moved to the back of the book the pages fell out. They weren't torn out, they hadn't even been bound into the book."
3,Dry guy boot cover size & durabilty,"Product is very effective in use but sizing is very small leading to excessive stretching and consequent damage, suggest buy a size larger than specified for your ski boots."
5,exelent,"good product, good price and good service.It was the same as it was in the image.Motorcraft RH43 Thermostat Housing"
2,all the same,this video just shows all the same old gripe that has gone on for years. its a good view for hard core fans other wise not much new in this tale of whoa.
2,Whatever happened?,"What kind of title is 'Whatever Happened to Pink Floyd'? We're not talking about some one hit wonder band that the world has completely forgotten about, we're talking about one of the greatest, most relevant bands in history. A band whose members still create and perform new music, as well as keeping the older Floyd songs in the spotlight through brilliant live performances. Waters has been packing the house with his Wall tour, and Gilmour put out a fantastic new album a few years ago, followed by an incredible tour. We know every bit of what these guys are doing now as we did in the 70's. The Wall at MSG, On An Island at Radio City, and The Allmans at the Beacon are by far the best shows I've seen in the past 5 years. Here's another good title for ya, 'Whatever Happened to the Allman Brothers Band'? Answer: they're alive and well and better than ever, just like Waters and Gilmour.Oh, and for the record, I haven't seen this DVD. I just dislike the title that much."
5,"A darn good, fast read","I enjoyed this, and stayed up all night. It was like I didn't want to look, but I had to look: an atrocity exhibition. Hemmingson keeps you turning the pages because you don't know what's going to happen next, and that's a gift. I'm curious what Hemmingson's next noir novel will be like -- just as fast paced? Just as exciting and surprising? We'll find out."
5,AMAZING stairs,"Bought these steps in an attempt to make my rat terrier stop begging to be picked up every time she wanted up on the bed. I read the reviews and figured that i should put a mat under them considering i have wood floors. This is correct they tend to slide without one, but this is so easily fixed i don't consider it a draw back especially considering the hassle they have spared me. Not only does my rat terrier use it every time she goes up or down, but my lab also uses them even though she can easily jump up and down with ease. It cracks me up every time i see the pups using the tiny stairs up and down from the bed!! lol i think this is one of the best $30 purchases i have ever made."
5,perfect pet steps,Perfect pet steps. Easy to fold up when not in use. Easy to clean. Light weight but sturdy.
2,Not for dogs of 20 or more lbs,"I was pretty dissapointed when I set this thing up and had my 22 lb Shiba Inu run up and down it, mainly because it shakes slightly and is unstable which prevents my dog from wanting to use it. Because of the design (fold down support, no side support, relatively high, light weight), a medium size dog doing anything but slowly walking up will most likely cause the steps to slightly jerk back and forth which is very scarry for dogs.I'll continue to train my Shiba, but the more I think about, the more I realize this wil lprobably never happen unless I modify the design to provide more side support and weight. I probably shouldn't have gone w/ the least expensive, but I have no idea why these things cost so much in the first place?!? I think i might just stop at home depot and build my own out of wood for $15"
4,Good Product,Very good solid product. Love it! Only thing is it could use better grippers on the bottom. They fall off easily.
2,my dog won't use these,"I have a 6 lb poodle that jumps on my bed, but is getting older. Bought these hoping he would use them. His nails scratch on the edges and it freaks him out. I wish it was all carpet. He's not used to stairs either. May be a good buy for someone else, just not my dog."
2,Kinda flimsy,The steps are pretty narrow and my 15 lb dog had trouble stepping down. Her paws would slip on the plastic so I had to put a towel on it to give her grip.
2,Solvit PupStep,This item came cracked in both corners on the top. It could have been the way it was shipped. It is too steep and my little dog didn't t want anything to do with it. I recommend one that is a few inches longer in length like the one I already have. She loves that one!
5,Solved our problem.,Excellent product! Exactly as described. Helped our little Milie get on the bed. Cute to watch her run up and down the stairs.Folding feature makes for easy storage. Highly recommend.
4,Great for the price.,"Great steps. Only problem was with the plastic pads for the bottom, which didn't stay in place at all. In fact, one ended up on the bottom of one of my shoes. Fortunately there are other alternatives if the plastic pads won't stay."
5,Dachshund Grand-dogs love the independance.,2 grand-dog Dachshunds are so happy to rule the house. They can join us when they wish to do so. They are comfortable using the stairs because the stairs feel sturdy to them. The purchase was smooth and efficient.
5,Great Value,"Extremely fast shipping and the pet stairs are exactly like the picture. AND it was ""Made in the USA""--kudos to Amazon-we need more items like this. Our Puggle learned to use the stairs in three tries with the treat method recommended in the instruction/suggestion sheet provided with the stairs. This item is the best value on the internet for your aging pup. Thanks Amazon."
5,Could be better,"Ordered these for my 14yo Pomeranian who was having trouble getting on/off the couch. These steps work great for her without any problems so far, they are sturdy and strong, but I do not think they would support a 120 pound dog as stated by the manufacturer.Now for the ""Could be better"" part:These steps are steep and the steps should/could have been deeper."
4,Good product for small dogs,"The review title pretty much says it all. Purchased this because my girlfriend brings her 100 year old dachshund over with her and he's too stiff to jump off and on the bed. Was also hoping my three-legged dog would use it also so she could get comfortable with it before she gets too old to jump.Here's the problem: while this is well built and well thought out (love the folding capability) I don't think it's wide enough for a dog bigger than say 35 pounds to feel comfortable going up and down. There are no side rails so if they slip off, down they go.While this will certainly support the weight of a larger dog none of mine seem comfortable using it because they are nervous about slipping and falling off.Moral of the story I guess is if you have a bigger dog, you're going to have to spend more money and get something wider with side rails of some kind. Who knows, could just be my dogs but they seem comfortable climbing up on everything else that I don't want them to!"
5,My dog loves this!,"My pet stairs arrived quickly and there's no assembly required. These stairs are much better (and better looking) than the bulky, block of carpeted stairs that you usually see in pet stores. These stairs are also less expensive here on Amazon compared to Petco. My dog was reluctant to use them at first but now it's the only way she""ll get on my bed. My dog weighs 17lbs and these steps are than sturdy enough to hold her weight as she RUNS up and down them.P.S. I recently got a kitten and she too loves these steps!"
3,"My pup said ""what the...""","Unfortunately, my pug didn't like these steps no matter how many times we practiced and enticed her with treats. I think if she was totally incapable of jumping up on the sofa, we would have been able to get her to use it. May have to try again in the future. The stairs are somewhat flimsy, and needs to be pushed up against the sofa, bed, etc., and somehow anchored in place, otherwise, it will slip about. Not a bad product for the price."
4,"Good, but could be more sturdy.","I use these stairs for my dog, the cutest Golden Retriever in the world (YES, even cuter than your cute dog), to go in/out of my car. He is 90 pounds and this product is just a tad bit unstable/wobbly when he goes down the stairs so I use my foot to brace the stairs against the car as he steps down them. If the plastic was another millimeter or two thicker, that would probably make it strong enough. I would also prefer that the stair tread (the part your pooch steps on) was a bit wider.The product is light and relatively easily folds to the closed position. The height perfectly aligns with the level of the rear seat in my 4-door sedan. Overall, I recommend this product so long as your furry friend is not over 100 pounds."
5,Pet Steps can hold some weigth!,"I researched several different types of pet steps and for various reasons, I decided on Solvit Pet Stairs. I needed pet steps that are heavy duty to hold the weight of twenty pound cats. Even though I'm buying it for my three senior cats, I knew that all the cats will end up using it. So far the steps have held up to three twenty pounds cats going up and down them, has stood up to cats racing on them, cat fights and it's even been used as a scratching post. This step has worked so well that I brought two more and one for my daughter's senior cat."
2,GOOD PRICE BUT NOT BUILT GOOD,"I HAVE HAD THE PET STAIRS FOR 2 MONTHS AND THE PLUG THAT WORKS LIKE A HINGE IS BROKEN... UP UNTIL THEN THE STAIRS WORKED GREAT..IT'S BEEN TO LONG TO RETURN THE STAIRS SO UNLESS I CAN FIND THE PART THAT IS BROKEN OR MAKE SOMETHING OF MY OWN TO WORK LIKE THE PLUG, THE STAIRS ARE WORTHLESS......"
4,Perfect Solution!,This was the perfect solution for my arthritic 16-year old kitty. It was easy to set up and has been sturdy enough for him to use with no problems. I would definitely recommend this!
4,climbing up,I got this so my dog could see out the window. She doesn't use it much but it's there if she needs it ~
5,A big help!!!,"My 9 yr old dog, Duke, can now get up on the bed without me having to pick him up. It only took a couple of dog goodies to teach him how to use the stairs. He & I both love the stairs;they have made both our lives easier and pain free."
3,Flimsy but okay for the price,"These steps are plastic everything, so don't expect a sturdy, solid piece of ""furniture"". My Papillion puppy will go up them to our bed, but not back down them--I put her on the top step and she bails over the side. Once she gets used to them, I think they will serve her fine. What I really like about them is that I can lean over the side of the bed (when I'm in it) and drag them out when I want her to come up...then I can close them and slide them back underneath when I don't want her to have access. Our bedroom is small, so this was definitely a space saver!8-14-2010 Update:Puppy has now gotten used to using the steps and runs up & down them without hesitation. These make me feel so much better about her safety when it comes to getting down from the bed!"
4,Works great,"We bought this to use so our dog can get up onto our bed. The color is great- matches our bedroom perfectly, and I love that it folds up and stores very well right under the bed. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because sometimes when my 30lb beagle runs up or down on the stairs very quickly, the stairs move slightly. Probably becasue of the lightweight design. But other than that, its great."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!,"It is NOT sturdy at all. If your dog is 5 pounds or less it might be ok, but my dog is 12 pounds and she won't even go up it because it moves when she tries to."
1,Not For Large Dogs,"Product description is inaccurate because it claims it will support a 120 pound dog. The steps are much too small to support any normal dog that would weigh 120lb, the steps are too narrow and risers too close together. 75lb standard poodle could/would not use this product as it was too small and wobbly. May be suitable for very small dog or a cat. EntirelyPets after delay eventually refunded full purchase price after negative review on this site but it cost me $12 to ship back which they did not refund."
5,Problem Solver!,This is one of the best purchases I've made for my puppy. She is a 5 pound Min Pin. It took her about two days to get used to walking up and down the stairs. I trained her by placing treats up each row of stairs and using lots of encouragement - now she's an old pro and can get up and down on her own from high places around the house. Awesome solution to what was a huge problem for us.Highly recommended!
4,Puppy steps,These steps are perfect for my little dog. They enable him to get up and down from the bed. The only think that isn't great is the locking system doesn't lock strong enough and it is easily unlocked with just a bump.
5,Perfect product for my pup,These steps are the perfect height for my 5 lb pooch to reach the bed. Many other steps advertised are not tall enough even though they have the same number of steps. They worked so well I bought a second set for the guest bedroom. Sturdy and light weight. Compact and fold up easily to store under the bed. Great price too.
3,Slippery Steps,I had to put a different non slip surface on each step because the stick on ones that came with it wasn't all that great and my dog's feet would slip on them.
5,Great buy,"Fast shipping and great stairs. My dog is only 12 pounds so there's no problem at all. Plus, when he's playing with our big dog he can hide underneath the stairs."
4,If your dog has trouble learning at first...,"My dog, Stevie, went up the stairs just fine if there was a treat waiting at the top...however, using them on her own was a different story. She would sniff at them and seemed to be scared of them. My sister had just purchased similar stairs, and I asked her for training tips. She suggested draping something soft, like a towel or blaket, over the entire staircase, and also putting bits of dog foot on each step. It worked like a charm! I think that Stevie didn't like the little patches of ""carpet"" that come with the stairs; either that or she didn't like the plastic parts. Now she is using them all the time! Great purchase, considering how inexpensive and convenient the product is."
2,Need to start when dogs are young,I purchased this for 'older dogs' who have trouble getting up on beds and sofas. They don't readily understand how to use it. I may yet get them trained but it is a struggle. This is a good product but will have more success with a young dog being trained.
3,No assembly required,"We use the steps for our pet Chihuahua to climb up and down to our bed. However, the steps are too small and too narrow. We would have preferred perhaps three steps instead of four. We are in the process of training our eleven year old Chihuahua to climb them. She is very hesitant about the narrow steps but has no problem climbing our normal stairs both up & down two flights. Other than the size of the steps, we like the fact that it has rubber feet and stair threads to prevent slipping. We would reccomend this for small dogs who can be trained.The steps do not reach the top of our bed, but the design of our bed allows for an additional step for our ""Chalupa"""
4,"Excellent, very light but sturdy",I have 2 dogs that weigh 15 to 20 lbs and these are great. The 10 year old is still learning to go up them. They are very light and can be moved when cleaning.
5,Great Product,"Product arrived quickly and was exactly what was ordered. I love the new steps, great price for the product!"
3,Great customer service,"Unfortunately my steps came in cracked (they were made of plastic). I contacted the Company and not only did they tell me to keep the steps, but they immediately credited my account.Very, very responsive and I would certainly buy again."
4,PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,"The PupSTEP is light but study. Our cat, who has never jump up on anything, loves the fact he can now get on the bed and sleep all day. I would purchase another one should I need another one."
3,"I love it, my doggies not so much","If I were the one using these steps, I would give it 5 stars. My dogs will use the steps, but only if I am there to 'help' them up, defeating the purpose of their crying to get on their favorite 'look out the window' chair.I am sure if your dogs are 'regular' and not spoiled beyond repair, they would love the steps. The price point is very fair, and the steps are sleek and clean looking."
3,"Nice stairs, but NO grip",My pug used to have a hard time jumping on the bed. So I got these stairs. They seem to work. Im suprised if anything that he actually uses them. But Ive noticed he slips. Im going to buy some carpet to line the stairs with.
2,Cheaper isn't always better,"I bought this for my bichon he has short little legs and has problems getting on and off our beds. We bought a more expensive doggie steps from Amazon and they were perfect. We needed another doggie step for another bedroom, so I decided to save a little money and go with this one, my dog wouldn't even go near it, he just went right around them and wanted to be picked up to be put on the bed. I will say we have hardwood floors so that is one of the problems b/c since it is plastic they don't stay in place, they might work better if you have carpet. But overall I don't recommend, I returned them."
3,to steep,"This item is for a specific size dog. A very small and light weight dog would be ok, but any dog weighting over 20 pounds has a hard time with the shallow steep steps."
3,Works for Cats but not dog,"My elderly cats think it's the bees knees. The dog simply cannot get enough room for her feet to manage it. AND it's the tallest one I could find, but still really too short for modern furniture, sofas/beds. The photo used for the product is very misleading."
5,Worth every penny,I bought this for my yorkie. At the time he was about 8 pounds and he is now 11 pounds. We used cardboard boxes as pet stairs for several months because I figured we could pick him up to put him on the bed as needed and he could use the boxes when ever we didnt pick him up. That quickly became annoying and he started ripping up the cardboard! I took a few minutes to teach him to walk up and down the stairs. When he is excited he bounds up the stairs skipping several with no problem. When he is tired/sleepy he walks up each stair with no problem. I haven't had any problem with the sturdiness but i do wish it were taller!
2,Not effective for a larger cat,"I'm giving this product two stars because it arrived on time, and in good condition. I think it would have worked well for a smaller cat, or a very small dog, like the one pictured in the product photo, but the description does promise to support more weight than that. Unfortunately, weight is not the only issue to consider: My cat is large at 20 lbs--not really fat, just a big breed--and the steps were very out of proportion to his natural stride. I tried coaxing him up and down a few times, but it was clear that his legs and paws were too big for the scale of these steps. In addition to the size of the steps, the plastic construction meant that the whole thing moved a little when my cat put his weight on it. Cat's really don't like feeling unsteady ground beneath them, and this movement scared him. I ended up buying a much more expensive carpeted, wood-construction ramp for the foot of our bed, and he has had no trouble using that."
3,"Good for small dogs or puppies, not so much for mid size","I have a fully grown corgi that have problems getting down these steps. The problem isn't the stairs height, so much as it's width. So unless my dog goes down the steps perfectly down the middle, the stairs tend to lift a bit to whatever side he's more close to which freaks him out."
5,Pet stairs,"I ordered this for my 19 yr old 3 legged cat. He has a rough time getting up in the chair or on sofa. The product was fantastic, well made, fast shipping. The problem was I didn't realize he could not go down these stairs as they were too narrow. He places his 1 front paw down and needs to get rear legs on same step so he needed wider /deeper steps. He had no problem going up the stairs. If looking for stairs for your pet, you need to stop and think if they could go up and down them."
5,Stair Carpet Adhesive,"GREAT product, exactly what my cat needed, but this product arrived with two out of four steps carpeted. The other two carpet segments, with semi-sticky adhesive, were in the bottom of the shipping box (having dislodged themselves?) and don't stick well to the steps. There seems to be no way to contact the seller to report this, so I'll be trying doublebacked tape soon. This is my only complaint; the product is more than satisfactory."
2,Pet Stairs,I think these pet stairs are a little slippery for our small dog. We have another type with a lamb wool type cover on the stairs that is not slippery. Thats my only complaint--------Johan
2,Perhaps nice for small dogs...,"...but did not work well for my 12 year old, 40 lb. mixed terrier. She was too afraid to use the steps because of the instability and slippery footing under her feet. These stairs do come with adhesive pads to place on the steps, but they do not seem to add to the comfort of the steps or aid in decreasing the possibility of skidding. When I did try to coax (force) her to use the steps, they jostled around so much that they frightened her even more. I will keep these steps, in case we ever get a smaller dog or another dog in the family needs them, however they do not seem like they would work for a medium-sized dog. I did like the ability to fold the steps, which makes for easy storage."
4,"Very sturdy, folds down for storage - great for price",These are great little pet steps! They are surprisingly sturdy and also fold down for easy storage which is great. I have a 12 pound chihuahua/terrier mix and after some coaxing (and treats) she is using them on her own to get up on our high beds. Great tool to save their little legs from injury and I can see it will help as she ages as well.Highly recommend this!
3,Little steep,"Bought this for a small dog with bad back leg. I need to get another, as the steps aren't very wide,and also it is too steep. However little chihuahua can run up it, so is a good product for the agility type dog with no hip problems. I would recommend it in that case.Got it promptly,I can always rely on Amazon to get the product to me as promised."
3,Just So So,"Our Bichon puppy did use these steps after training him with treats, but he stumbles because the step depth is way too narrow, and it has too many stairs to navigate. Maybe they would be suitable for a teacup or a chihuahua. Our puppy's gait skipped steps and he fell off the sides once. Our other Bichon Frise, who was ill, really had a hard time using the stairs. I give this product 3 stars because it works, just not very well. So we decided to replace the Pup Solve it stairs with the Pet Gear Easy Step I Pet Stairs, 2 Step, which is pretty much perfect for $25, and we are very happy with them."
