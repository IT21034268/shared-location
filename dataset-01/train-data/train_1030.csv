3,Good insights but Turabian is better for the mechanics,"Barzun and Graff offer a guide to writing and research that is much more than a nuts and bolts how-to guide, which is a good thing because Turabian eclipses them on the technical aspects of scholarly writing. What they offer is concise, useful direction on how to effectively research, analyze and write about a topic. Warnings against bias, misinformation and fallacies are given in the first part of the work, Principles and Methods of Research, which is the better half of the book. In general, they instruct the researcher what to look out for and pitfalls to avoid. The second half of the book is concerned with the presentation of your research. Particularly useful is the section on jargon and cliches as well as their emphasis on clarity and liveliness in writing. As has been mentioned, the sections on footnotes, bibliography, manuscript prep, etc. are less helpful. Overall, the work, when taken in its entirety, is full of wisdom and insight."
1,rode hard and put away wet,"The book is what I ordered, a book for a class. The only problem was it was wet when I got it; the packaging was fine so it wasn't in shipping. I was apparently PACKED that way! Now, I got it cheap, so its excusable; and its not a book that will mean something to me for very long, just a book for a class for writing my Masters' thesis. It's just the thought that someone would really knowing pack a wet book and send it. Strange.Modern Researcher - Fifth Edition"
5,The Modern Researcher,This book is a very useful tool for the researcher. It gives you all the insight necessary to conduct an investigation. The narratives is written in a very easy to understand language. Highly recommended.
4,"Awesome pictures, but really a coffee table book","This book is really more of a coffe table book if it were not for the great full colored photos and list of references in the back. The text gives a good general overview of anthropology and human evolution, but still it seems like a coffee table book. The pictures are invaluable however."
4,A great book to own. Excellent photography.,"Contemporary Paleoanthroplogy needed this book. David Brill's expert photographs of most of the major hominid fossils invite hours of study in themselves. The text is a tad on the elementary side for those with a serious interest in the field, yet Dr. Johanson has a gift for making powerful arguments out of plain words... But the lifesize photography is the centerpiece. The book's physical dimensions are as they are to accomodate full scale skull photos. To see fossils like Mrs. Ples, Zinj and the Black Skull staring back at you almost as equals is alone worth the purchase price."
1,Bad body oxidation.,"This is a very nice router. Works well, very nice soft start, a bit unusual fine adjustment, but it does work. Unfortunately over the last three years the body has oxidized so badly that the motor is now stuck in the base making the router completely useless. If Amazon allowed negative stars, I would put -10 stars for this router. The oxidation is so bad that even using a rubber hammer, removing the lock completely, the motor can not be moved in the base. It is going out in the trash on Monday. Update: Tried WD-40, with overnight soaking, the motor became removable from the base. Wire bushed the oxidation away. Now to decide upon something like wax to keep the oxidation at bay! Will be keeping router."
2,Body Oxidation makes this router unusable for me,"I bought the 1618EVS at the Chantilly VA tool show in March of 2003, and had problems with the router motor sticking in the base from the very first usage. Even with the clamp completely loose, the grey/white oxidation on the motor casing causes so much friction that installing/raising/lowering the router is a painful experience. Nothing I've tried so far removes the oxidation. I will be trying to return this, soon. Too, bad, because I love my other Bosch tools. (1619 router is awesome, as is 1587 jigsaw)"
4,very nice -- but could improve,"i was using this router for almost a yr now and it is quite nice, smooth, quite etc., as claimed by the salesmanship.here are some (small) things to improve:1. the locking botton in the D-handle is hard to operate because it is recessed too deep.2. there is no locking mechanism for the shaft, so you need to use two wrenches.3. a little light-bulb right next to the collet could be useful4. there is too much play in the depth adjustment mechanism, sothe scale reading is useless.i have a cheap craftmen router which solved the first 3 problemsand cost about a 1/3 of this router, so they should have solved these problems with this router.but overall, it is a good router and is worth the money."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"From the poor ergonmics on both switches, to the RFID tag IN THE HANDLE that comes lose and shorts across the power connections (and almost starts a fire), to the sloppy fitting baseplate that bosch wants you to buy a plastic ""tool"" to recenter the plate over the collet, to the ridiculous ""double-clutch"" collet that is an absolute PITA, to the user unfriendly design of the d-handle mounting and inter=connecting cord, to the incredibly soft magnesium cast body, and finally to the most laughable and useless depth adjustment mechanism (not even worthy of a cheap chinese machine tool), this has to be one of the most poorly designed routers I have ever encountered in my life. I've tried to live with this POS for a year, and now I'm going back to a Sears model!!"
5,Super Router!,"This is by far the best router that I have used. It is incredibly powerful, quiet, and lite. The D-handle is the way to go. It makes me a better woodworker. I have been testing the new Makita and this router from a fellow woodworker for about three months, and after using both, I had to buy this one. The Makita isn't bad, but the 2 1/4 horsepower is not correct. Never judge a router by the horsepower...manufacturers lie to sway you. Always go by the amps. This is the first Bosch tool I've purchased, and after using it, it will not be the last. Tip: The D-handle may have to be removed if you plan on using the router in a table. My mounting plate is 9"" by 12"", and I must remove the D-handle if I choose this router for the table. Not a big deal, it is still well worth getting the D-handle without question."
2,Disappointing,"I sat through this last night on network TV. Wish I could have that hour and a half back. This movie shouldn't really be called Western. It's more like a strange, dysfunctional parody that isn't funny. The dialogue is so trite that it distracts from good scraps of acting. The cast could and should have been impressive. Gene Hackman reprises his typecast role as the resident control freak. Sharon Stone is the absurdly beautiful victim seeking vengeance. The ending fizzles. If you enjoy graphic violence and not much else, this is the movie for you. If you would rather have characterization, plot and maybe even a life lesson, consider the other Quick And The Dead movie that stars Sam Elliott."
2,A Leo Movie,"Yes Leonardo DiCaprio again. Movie was watchable but you have to appreciate it for what it is, A Spaghetti Western. I got a few laughs and it was good to see Russell Crowe acting too. This movie was nothing spectacular but I would watch it again sometime, if only to see a younger Leo acting."
3,A Violent Treat,"It's entertaining at times. Gene Hackman shouts very well, as usual. Sharon Stone is good, too. It's a treat for lovers of violence and fans of the stars. Leonardo DiCaprio looks impetuous in this film."
2,Now I remember why this film isn't remembered.,"I went to movies once this film came out so many years ago. I've use to chase Gene Hackman's films, on that moment nor Crowe even less Dicaprio were reconognized actors. Once I saw the Blu Ray's movie version I thought ""What an awesome casting for this movie!"", so I get it. I am still thinking it is a some great performances on the movie, but I think it has a really bad director. I have to say that this movie's director could not took advantage of a great casting. What a pitty!"
2,Worse than your Average Western,"I've seen this movie twice and I only watched it a second time because I wanted to be extra fair in forming an opinion about it. The story is pretty simple: Bloodsport with revolvers. The actors are mostly there to pick up their paychecks (except for Russell, he does a decent job but that is far from enough to save the movie), and the screenwriter is 4. In a previous review someone mentioned that Hackman gave a good performance...that is not true as far as I can tell. He is in his default ""yelling old dude"" mode and it isn't all that interesting. He didn't want to do Westerns anymore...even to the point that when Eastwood approached him with Unforgiven he refused...multiple times. His lack of enthusiasm shows. If you're feeling the need for some good Western action then check out Unforgiven, High Noon, Stagecoach, The Searchers, The Wild Bunch, Shane, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, or any number of other quality Westerns. Put this one low on your list."
3,Hmmmm.... So So (3.5 stars),"I give it three stars because it's not too bad. It gets another half star for all the cool gunfighting...Gene Hackman is believable as an over the hill gun fighter. He controls a small town by force. He has a contest to find the best and fastest gunfighter. ""Single-Elimination""... :) Lose the gunfight and you are out.The bartender uses a big chalk board to keep track of the standings.Some of the lowlifes and scoundrels that come for a piece of the action are pretty funny to watch. The indian who can't shoot straight and won't die. Leonardo DiCaprio as the young kid that really cocky and fast. Sharon Stone with a mysterious past and a need for revenge. Yes, she is one of the gunfighters. Russle Crowe is another mystery in this film... Not entirely sure what his story is... A preacher with a gun?Anyway, this one is ok. Worth a look. When I see it on TV as I am flicking channels, I usually stop for a few minutes. There's always something going on...."
4,Liked the film more than I expected,I did like the film more than I expected. Russell did his usual great job. Was glad to have the film letterboxed. Wish Sharon could have kept her clothes on.
5,Great Gift,"I bought this for my Father who is into all the old western, war time movies. He looked all over the place for this movie and could not find it, so I looked on Amazon and tah-dah! I ordered it and recieved it within three days, my Father didn't know I had found it. He was so happy, he's watched it at least four times, and now his DVD collection is at around 250 movies. If I need to find something, I know where to go from now on. It's quick and easy."
3,cut?,Entertaining movie. I really enjoyed it but what happened to the love scene between Sharon Stone and Preacher? Cut????? Is the American version different from the French version????hmmmm interesting
4,Not much Difference.,"This movie was great on DVD, but had very little change on Blue-ray. I imagine the special effects would sound great on a home theater system with say 7.1 surround sound, but this i don't have. so i can give very little input on the sound quality, as for the picture i just did not see a difference. I hope this in some way helps one decide whether or not to buy this movie. Thank you."
4,A very good western.,A great western with an all-star cast.Well directed by Sam Raimi with a very good blu-ray transfer.Pull the trigger. You will like it.
1,horrible,Anyone ANYONE who liked this movie has zero appreciation for a good western.this is one of the worst movies ever! western or any genre!!!!
1,Garbage,"The real premise of this movie is: only women have any remorse over murder (but they can get over it), and only good dental hygiene stands a chance of keeping you from violent death. A thoughtless, gratuitously violent movie that unsuccessfully recycles Hackman's great turn in Unforgiven and leaves DiCaprio's undeniable charm and brightness flapping in the void of Sharon Stone's vapid presence. Fans of this film: raise your standards!"
1,Terrible,I watch this movie and it was terrible. Leonardo character was always trying to please his dad. And Sharon Stone; I don't know what her charater was all about. she was suppose to be big and bad. This movie was plain stupid. Don't buy it or rent unless you are desperate to be bored.
1,Sharon Stone as tough cowgirl ? hmm.... yeah !,This is yet more evidence that Stone never outdid her performance in Casino. She is totally miscast in this role and the plot is very weak.
2,Ugh!,"What was this guy thinking while he was directing? I love a good western and I love Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman and Russell Crowe. But as I sat through this video I kept hoping I'd see something good. There was some good action at times, but I was still left hangin' because this movie could have been better. The background of Stone's character was ugly enough to make her hard, cold attitude understandable. But everything else was weak. Maybe with a different director or writer it would have been better. I don't know. But I say ""thumbs way down"" on this one."
4,As fun as a western can get,"Leave it to Sam Raimi to bring this much of a colorful cast of heroes/ heroines, villian, drifters, scum, and young cockey gunglingers all together for an unbelievably good time! Sure, the plot is thin, sure its ripped straight from westerns that came before it. Sam wanted to entertain and that he does. He uses all his usual stylings: cameral angles, over-the-top characters, and unusual special effects; nothing is held back here. Sharon Stone is an amazingly strong female lead: my hats off to her for such a wonderful performance. My favorite though in all these was Lance Henricksen who plays Ace: the man-in-black, mysterious drifter who comes to town for the shootout. Even though Im not a Leonardo fan, he does a really neat job as they young smart alec shootist. Its just a good time and worth watching more than once. Highly recommended!"
3,Entertaining...,"An entertaining movie with plenty of star power but no subtlety or depth. Good guys and bad guys and of course one really bad guy. But gene hackman in this film is like a caricature of his little bill character from unforgiven.Look at the guy(ace) who walks into the bar right after sharon stone early on. It's comedic, the guy isn't scary or intimidating just stupid looking. Later we see a guy with a babe on each arm proclaiming his desire to be in the tournament for the state of texas. Right away instead of gun fights and life and death it is more like real life cartoons.The story is decent, the acting is decent and i think dicaprio outshines them all including hackman! Sharon stone looks hotter in this film than ever if that means anything.It's not that this is a bad film just that there are 100 westerns that are better you can own and this film has been all over television for free. Charles bronson alone made 7-8 better westerns."
3,Western Bloodsport,"As someone has already noticed, ""The Quick and The Dead"" is something of a western version of ""Bloodsport."" Not only is the plot taken from the realm of martial arts movies, but the director also shamelessly hijacked entire scenes from far superior westerns such as ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West.""However, despite the unoriginality and thinness of the plot and its rip-offs (homages?) of classic westerns, ""The Quick and The Dead"" is a fairly entertaining movie. It's not meant to be taken seriously, and some parts border on sheer camp. It's just a fun movie with a pretty good cast and some neat camera tricks."
4,"A Visually Amazing, Gun's a Blazing Original.","Being that this film stars Russell Crown AND Leonardo de Caprio in their Pre-Megastar days, I feel that this film deserves another look from it's critics, maybe now you'll see it for what it is.. A Revisionist Setting his sights on the west, much like Sergio Leone and Robert Rodriguez, only their visions fared better Critically and at the Box Office.It is a Daring Film from a Daring Film maker, The Acting is Top Drawer, with the 2 actors mentioned about as standouts. If you still haven't seen it, see it now, if you saw it and were displeased, give it another go."
3,Female Gunslinger Movie,Sharon Stone is excellent in this movie. Stone seeks revenge against Hackman for his part in her father's death. She has been preparing for that moment most of her life. Stone enters a contest of gunslingers...will she have her vengeance? Is she good enough? Check it out!
5,Awesome movie! ! !,"This is only one of a handful of movies I have watch multiple times, however, this is the first time I have seen any version other than the ""TV"" version. The DVD version was much more intense, more detailed, more exciting - - - Only regret is that I had not ordered it much earlier. The Quick and the Dead is still a movie I can watch again and again."
2,Aw C'mon,"Well, if you want a film with lots of violence, good guys and bad guys, and happily fulfilled vengence - I am not giving anything away unless you can believe this might be a trajedy - yet don't care that it lacks a soul, this is your film. However, if you hope to find good drama, better-than-formulaic acting, and quiky surprises, forget this. In my view, there is nothing to this whatsoever that makes it any better than a waste of time. And not a good waste of time at that.Not recommended. It is nothing but stereotypes, indifferenct acting, and utterly predicatable."
1,Good grief...,"How corny can you get? Seeing sunlight through a man after he's been shot? Come on, wouldn't there be blood? Seeing a bullet hole through a man's head? Still corny because you have no blood, no brains, and th guys stands there for a while. But someone gets shot in the eye and they do flips? Dicrapio *****, Stone is a wanna-be Clint ""the man"" Eastwood, and Hackman is unbelivable. The preacher, Cort, is played by Russel Crowe of LA confidential fame. Is he good in this movie? Yes and no. LA Confidential he is more belivable. All in all, don't see it. See the Unforgiven"
4,The Quick and the Dead is the Bomb,Fantastic movie with a star studded cast. I like Russell Crowe's performance he actually outperformed sharon Stone and Gene Hackman despite him not having many lines in the script.Great storyline as well based on Sharon Stone's character seeking revenge for her father's death at the hands of Hackman's character. Russell Crowe's character in a battle to put his former life as an outlaw behind him and trying to life of a christian.Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!
5,Classic must have western collection,This movie must be one of the greatest western made movies. The casting and the shooting action make this one of the best western films I have ever seen.
4,"""Terrific Western!""","Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe and LeonardoDiCaprio star in Sam Raimi's 1995 western. A female gunslingerenters a quick-draw contest to get revenge on a sadistic mayor.Sharon is great in this and Gene is also a great villain as usual.This dvd has nice picture and sound, but only the trailer. Getthis terrific western."
4,Raimi's vision of the west,"It took me many years to finally decide to watch The Quick and the Dead. It didn't look that interesting, and I thought had the potential to be a bad film. But Sam Raimi did direct it, so I knew there was potential for it to be good. And it is. Raimi is the man who directed the Evil Dead series, Spider-Man, Darkman, and The Gift, and helped to bring us Xena and Brisco County. So this western has the Raimi flair. It's a straightforward story of redemption and revenge, told with Raimi's stylistic flair. Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe give good performances, and Gene Hackman does a great job as the main baddie (no surprise there). Even Sharon Stone does a good job of portraying Ellen with the right amount of anger, fear, and uncertainty. But Stone's performance isn't quite as convincing as the other actors'. There's something missing from her performance. But it is a solid movie. The dvd contains no extras."
4,Great western for Today,"This movie is very entertaining and I loved the photography tricks. Stone, Hackman and Russell Crowe give good performances. Dicaprio is entertaining as well as suited for this part. I enjoyed it! One of the best westerns made in this era that I've seen."
5,"A stylish , visually incredible modern western.","Sam Raimi's films is a very stylish take on western movies as his innovatively flamboyant visuals and creative direction make this one of the best western movies ever made. man and Stone give riveting performances as well as Dicaprio who although having a small role proves his presence. Being attacked as an unoriginal pastiche of Leoni's spaghetti western is a huge misjudgement as indeed Raimi borrows a bit from old westerns , but his film is a unique stylishly made wetsern that stands on its own."
3,The excellence is in the details,"Never mind the ordinary revenge plot and the stupid dialogue (full of 20th-century phrases like, ""You have a problem with me?"")--just sit back enjoy the other aspects of the film, which are all excellent: snappy direction, great sets and set dressing, beautiful costumes and props, etc. Particularly noteworthy is the superb sound track with its sonorous gunshots, boots on the boardwalk, creaking wood and leather, and jangling spurs. Also very fine is Alan Silvestri's effective score. The cast is tops, for the most part, and the actors all appear to be having fun with their colorful characters and little bits of stage business (Lance Henriksen trimming his moustache, Keith David smoking his Meerschaum pipe). In short, the movie has a rich texture and is very well-crafted. Too bad the story and dialogue aren't anything special."
1,Bluffer's stuff,"I ordered the TANTUS BEGINNER PENIS RING, 2 inches size.Well, BEGINNER inwhat sense?? I would say the size is for extra large endowments. The product is ok (the quality) but the size is for porn stars..I'm experienced in cockrings, just didn't know the size, but this is a kind of turn down for beginners."
3,A great CD set if you're proficient in German,"Fine performances on this 4-CD set of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, the first half (i.e., Parts 1-3) only, sung (as usual) in German. The 160 minutes of spoken introductions are in German. It's too bad that this set isn't available with the same introductions, but spoken in English, and with the text of Parts 1-3 printed in a booklet in both German and English."
4,"Exquisite music, but not the best recording","I bought this disc on the strength of the Penguin Guide's 3-star review. I am sorry to say that this was one of the rare instances where I could not agree with the Penguin's assessment. To be sure, the accoustic's great, and if you are a fan of the great English choral tradition you'll probably love this disc.However, if you want a recording (especially of the locus iste) that has heart and presence, get the Jochum on Deutsche Grammophon. This Naxos was just too sterile for my taste."
2,Poor performance of Great music,"Listening to Bruckner's motets can be very enjoyable. I purchased this CD with high anticipation. Unfortunately, the choir's performance left much to be desired. Poor tuning, strained voices, and a lack of attention to sonority and nuance encouraged me to shelve this CD and look for a replacement."
2,Should have bought the book,"This tape is difficult to listen to. The presentation just isn't good. The information seems valuable, but was hard to follow while listening in the car."
3,A few pearls of wisdom amidst the chaff,"Judging by the number of editions available, Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"" is more popular and relevant than ever. Like many classic books of ideas, however, it is somewhat disappointing to read ""in the flesh"". Yes it contains a few pearls of wisdom but to get to them you have to wade through (a) 2000 year old advice on things such as how many chariots a general needs (quaint but not useful), and (b) lots of mystical mumbo-jumbo. The introduction by John Minford is excellent describing the context in which The ""Art of War"" was written."
2,Basics of warfare for 12 year olds,"Sun Tzu's the art of war is one of the most overrated books in terms of content. It is not that the writer is wrong about most subjects (though a lot is hopelessly outdated). The problem is that any 12 year old who has played with toy soldiers enough, could have written this book, without the fancy words or synonyms.Don't attack when outnumbered, with the sun in your face etc etc. The very basics of battles, not even of warfare. True warfare, now and then, relies more on logistics with the battles being just a small part of war.So if you are completely ignorant of battles and war and simple logic you can read this book and be satisfied. However if you are truely interested in the ""art of war"" then read the book with that same name from Machiavelli."
5,A book full of interesting ideas of war,"This book is a masterpiece of strategies and principles of war. They show you winning and losing tactics and show you definitions of a good warrior and a bad warrior. The rationales are more easily understood if you are interested in war and fighting strategies and like most important writings, it can take a while to absorb and understand what is written by Sun-Tzu. I have read the book in parts and keep flicking through it for wisdoms and they do not always stay in my head but they are interesting and cover many fields of warfare. It is a well written book, simple and elegant in its way. It is clear in words but needs some study to be an expert on the the work of Sun-Tzu and his book 'The Art of War'."
3,This version favors Poetry over Faithful Translation,"Having so many versions of ""The Art of War"" in print, I wanted a chance to check this book out at the book store. After flipping through the other books first, it was startling the way the John Minford translation phrases Sun-Zhu's words--it's more like poetry with visual stylistic charm, where Minford has taken the tranlation directive of curtness of phrases (think E.E. Cummings) and stylistic ""beauty"" over what I believe is the real strategy-led-tactics teachings behind ""The Art of War"". As a result the book reads fun, but really is at the expense of what I feel is important--the message of Sun-Zhu. The front flap of the cover itself attest to this philosophy of translation, and even uses the word ""chilling"" and ""poetry"".Summary:4 stars--for poetry1 star --for fidelity of translation."
2,Sun Tzu for those with A.D.D.,"I must first admit, I had bought into the hype over how The Art of War is the greatest strategic document ever produced. I was expecting some fantastic insight and in reality, the Art is, like most brilliant strategies, very simple and basic steps to follow. The trick is to not overlook the basics and keeping the discipline to always follow them.The book itself was set up into a very long and rambling prologue, then quotes from Sun Tzu followed by quotes from other Chinese leaders and/or philosophers. There is no discussion about the meaning or intent of Sun Tzu beyond the quotes from the supporting cast. In short, the book is written with quotes supported by other quotes without any context. If you read books to get the full story and context behind a subject, go elsewhere. If you are content with sound bytes and 10 second clips, this book is for you."
3,long introduction,The book is very interesting but I thought the translator's introduction was too long (more than a quarter of the whole book).
5,Good Read,"This is a good read with many proverbs and sayings that are still applicable to modern times. Sun Tzu is vague, and it for that very reason that this book is ever-lasting.Also recommended: The 36 strategies, The book of five rings (Go Rin No Sho), and the Hagakure."
4,Good but there are better translations,"I agree with fellow reviewers that this is aclassic for any situation or need... However,given Cleary's history of mistranslations (suchas The Book of the Five Rings) I believe thata translation from a modern author of Chinese origin (maybe even another westerner- but I doubt it) who is fluent in both English and Chinese would fare better with readers. (I've seen one - unfortunately I forgot the author's name)"
2,Childrens book,"Sun Tzu and his famous work The Art of War have been whittled down to a simple children's book in this particular copy. The content of his original work pertains to military strategy, yet in this copy I feel like a 3 year old when I read it. You would think a book called The Art of War, read by military and business leaders from around the world, would look more impressive. It is a small book with glossy pages, nothing authentic. Each page has about one sentence, like reading a children's book, with simple commentary below to help nudge you along. I am unimpressed with this and have returned it, opting instead for this book --> 1934255122 (copy/paste in Amazon search bar) which is separated into original Chinese text, English translation, and English translation with commentary. When Sun Tzu says you must understand or examine something, YOU must do it. Only then is it satisfying.Venting complete.Have a nice day."
3,Abridged to Death,"This was a well-spoken, well read and nicely translated version of Sun-Tzu's master piece. It also is too short. I felt that since it was so cheap it probably was a good value, but I also have to convey my sense of disappointment in its length and depth. Would I buy this had I heard it once? No. But now that I do own it, I will listen to it many, many times."
5,got wood?,"The Bosh jig saw and blades are at this point nothing new, as they have been around for 20 years or so. This is what you should have if you are a pro; and even for the handy person. This is the finest saw and blade type in the world."
2,Broke after 1 year,"I was really enjoying my massager. I wish it had a massage to go under the foot (it would just vibrate), but with such bad feet as I have, this was giving me a lot of relief.Then, it broke. The vibration still works, but it seems the motor froze up on me. I think it occurred just before the warranty expired, but I did not notice until just after it expired (but 10 days after it expired). I emailed the company and they said it would cost $125 to get it fixed.Really? Yes, the warranty is for one year, but this is a big ticket item (at least for me).If you make a product, there should NOT be an issue with freezing motors after 1 year.I wish I could still use this, but am NOT laying out almost half the cost it originally was bought for to have it work for 1 more year."
3,ok but poor delivery service,product is good but the delivery service made me feel like as why did i order this product.....
2,Beware the inevitable product failure!,Bought this for my wife 5 months ago. Worked great the first 4 months. But power cord into back went bad. Seems to be both a cord and connection problem. Bigger problem -- No Warranty! And No way to contact QLive. Beware this product! I wish I'd spent more for the Brookstone version - at least I could get that fixed.
1,bad service,Be aware of worst service!My massager broke after 3 months of using.It was working pretty good in the beginning but the squeezing modestopped working after awhile.According to the seller the item has a 1yr warranty but hewouldn't pay for the shipping. I just went to the UPS store andit would cost me about $77+packing about $103 and I called the seller to see if he can help me out with the shipping and his answer was flat NO with lots of screaming. He just wouldn't hear my comments and complaints.Worst customer service experience ever!!! and of course poorly madeproduct!!
1,Avoid this company,"I purchased this unit 4 months ago. It suddenly stopped working. Although it has a 1 year warranty, the caveat is you must pay for shipping to California. In my case that represents a significant percentage of the unit's cost. Reputable companies I have dealt with in the past cover the return cost for defective merchandise. This concept is lost on Magic Wholesale. My advice is to spend a few dollars more and deal with a company that stands behind its' products and offers good customer service. Magic Whole is NOT one of those companies. Avoid this product."
4,A massager that works!,Half the price of Brookestone Massager and same quality massage.My legs and feet no longer ache.
2,Don't trust this product!,"I bought the leg massager for my parents in early October and it malfunctioned in a month. I called Mega Wholesales for information about my options and the guy kept yelling at me to just return it for repair. They are based in California and I am 3000 miles away. Not only was he completely unprofessional, he said I only get 30 days after purchase to return it- like he was doing me some kind of favor. I thought the warranty was one year, but it's hard to tell because warranty info was not included in the packaging. This completely sucks.I still love Amazon though!"
1,Stopped working!,I loved it for the 5 months that it worked... The power cord isn't working and I cannot find a replacement! I have tried contacting Qlive and searching for the model number of the power cord. It is very disappointing...
4,Good product,"This foot and calf massager is great for those who are NOT ticklish! I love the kneading option, but cannot stand the vibration setting. However, my boyfriend loves it, especially after a good game of basketball!"
5,Foot/Calf massager,"This product is great and works as well or better than the much more expensive Brookstone model. Neither have much product support but my last Brookstone lasted for 2 years exactly. You get hooked on these things as NOTHING else makes your feet and calfs feel so good. But if you have chubby to fat calfs, don't get it as it will feel like the jaws of death. At half the price of the Brookstone I can only say BUY it and see if it doesn't do what it advertises to do. I love it!"
1,"very bad service from the seller, defective item received","""I received a defective foot massager for which I had paid a heavy price of 250 dollars. Seller does not respond my calls. Foot massager is very heavy and will cost a lot to ship it back. I am still following up with both Amazon and Seller to see if my return shipping will be re-imbursed. Overall a very bad service. I am completely dissatisfied to receive a defective item and the hassles of return"""
5,Wonderful Massager,"From all the massagers and relaxing gadgets out there, this has been the one that I found most functional and effective. I've suffered lately of pain on my feet either from stress or just long walks, this massager has proved to be a good solution.I've used it for 15 minutes either at night or morning and have felt my feet rejuvenated, the pressure points this massager applies increases my blood flow beautifly, eradicating most of my pain and leaves my feet feeling rested.The only thing I'd add to this item is more pressure points on the arch, but I don't count it as a flaw since I'd consider that a plus"
3,"The best of heavy metal, but still stranded there","Despite the black metal voices and aggressive musicianship, this is neoclassical heavy metal of the previous generation done up in a newer style. While sweetly dissonant and churning emotion in its scenery of changing moods, this release is ultimately unsatisfying to the mind while the body is sated. A better band in this style would be At the Gates or Sacramentum."
3,CHECK MY PICS. It's OK. Doesn't fit 15+ knives of different sizes,"This knife case is not what I expected. A lot of my knives have wider blades (i.e. wider handles) and there wasn't enough elastic to accompany all of them. If you have a bunch of small knives like kershaw leeks, butterfly knives, etc--this would be perfect for that. But when I was putting in my SOG Vulcan VL-03, Benchmade Barrage and Spyderco knives, the elastic just wouldn't stretch anymore. It's not like each knife has it's own little band of elastic. For 4 knives, it's the same 2 strips (side by side) of elastic, so if you put in a large knife, it's going to pull the other 3 slots of elastic tighter. I hope that makes sense, it's hard to describe. For the price, it's not that bad, but is definately room for improvement.**I posted pictures as well to show what I'm talking about"
3,Good case for small knives,"The case is nice for the money but the space between the elastic is tiny. It would be great for thin bladed/ handled knives. If you are planning on keeping anything much larger than a kershaw leek or similar you might want to look elsewhere. Even small thicker bladed knives like spyderco dragonfly max out the elastic.So basically, it's a nice cheap case if you have a lot of small knives but won't hold more than 7 or 8 of what I would consider ""average/medium"" knives."
4,Good case,Looks just like the pictures. Great for keeping all pocket knives together so they don't get misplaced. No problem with shipping. Glad I made this purchase.
2,How Not to Play Bach,"This CD should have been called ""How Not to Play Bach"". Mr. Rübsam continually disrupts the natural flow of the music with overly ""romanticized"" hesitations, at times purposely causing the counterpoint to sound out of sync, and substituting his own rhythms which undermine the architectural unity of the music. The stuff he does with trills at times just sounds wierd. Bach infused all his music with an air of sacred contemplation (even his secular works like the inventions), so it's often easy to tell wether a performer is trying to communicate Bach's intentions or their own. Rübsam sounds as though he simply doesn't get it. At least he has good technique."
1,Makes me dizzy,"Now don't get me wrong, I am not against rubato in Baroque music and am not a purist who wants the Inventions played in a ""correct"", textbook fashion, but Rubsam really murders these pieces. Ok, use some rubato in the slower ones, but in #8? This is the liveliest of the set and to hear rubato and beats stretched out in every measure makes me seasick. It's not just in #8, but all of them! Rubsam has a nice sound, but also a terrible rubato habit that becomes so predictable that it's a farce. Also, #15 is so slow it's ridiculous."
2,Offbeat Performance,"If you enjoy Bach served up like something from a 20th Century French impressionist, then you might like this.I tried to keep an open mind, but couldn't stomach the wild variations in tempo, the liberties from steady rhythm, the ad lib flourishes. I am all for bringing out the lyricism in baroque music, but this goes too far.The slower pieces were too sweet and syrupy; those in minor key were overly melodramatic. Ultimately the impression is of a performer trying to transform the music into something far beyond what was written. So instead of harmony and counterpoint, we get sturm and schmaltz.While listening to the #8 invention in F major, that warhorse imposed on generations of piano students, I thought I could hear the moaning and displeasure of my piano teacher in the background, pleading, ""Stick to the music!"" But unfortunately, these performances don't."
2,Alien performances of Bach study pieces.,"Even for a budget label, this recording just does not cut it. Wolfgang Rubsam's interpretations of the Two-Part and Three-Part Inventions are very slow and very--surprisingly--rubato for a set of Baroque compositions. The joy goes out of Invention no. 8, the fun goes out of no. 13, and the trills are strangely performed like crescendos in no. 4. Even though this is one of the few albums that has both versions of the Two-Part Invention no. 1, which makes the number of pieces played thirty-one, Bach's Inventions when played should not require more sixty-six minutes of playing time. The slow interpretations plus the horrible ten- to fifteen-second pauses in between each track make this CD something one can do without."
5,One of the best compendiums in the subject,"Peter Ludlow has also edited a volume on the Philosophy of Mind, and has written a book on Semantics. In this volume, he offers perhaps the best single volume compendium on this difficult subject. Note that this is for serious students and is hardly a beginner's introduction to the field. However, as a companion to a course on philosophy of language, or for more serious students, it should be quite valuable.The analytic philosophical approach could be complemented by more material from continental schools of thought on language. If you are interested in that, I would suggest looking elsewhere for some supplementary material."
2,It must be really easy to please some people,I found nothing hilarious about this movie at all. I think there were only two times during the whole thing where I even let out a giggle. And how many strip clubs does one movie need? Come on! I gave it two stars instead of one because at least Cusacks character does realize that Thornton and the stripper were going to kill him. What worthless characters throughout the whole movie. And I really wish someone would have killed Cusacks constantly drunk and lewd friend.
1,What Happened???,"If you don't think it's possible for a movie with the talents of John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Oliver Platt and Randy Quaid to be downright awful, think again. I actually bought this DVD instead of renting it. It had all of my favorite actors in it, a promising plot.. What could go wrong? Well, for starters, I pushed PLAY!!! Oliver Platt's performance would have to be considered the best and considering the rest, that's a sad statement. This movie was SLOW. I wanted to jump up and down on the fast forward button to make it go faster. It was depressing and I don't mean that in a tearjerker/feel good kind of way. It just flat out sucked."
1,How could Cusack and Billy Bob be in such a bad movie?,The Ice Harvest is neither a suspense thriller nor a dark comedy. It's just a poorly done movie. It has big enough stars that I expected better than this tripe.Stay away. Don't waste your time or money. Watch John Cusack or Billy Bob Thornton in other movies. They both reached a new low with this and probably wish they could burn all the copies of this wretched mess.
1,dry Ice is more like it,"John Cusack seemed like he would have a thriving acting career. in truth his name should be mentioned with Edward Norton&Robert Downey Jr in terms of pulling off certain type of roles&making them work,but this Film is a clunker. John Cusack in this role feels like he got a Left-Over ROle intended for John Travolta which He wouldn't have any parts of&rightfully so. something about Cusack in this role makes me think of one of Travolta's 90's action type films.Billy Bob Thornton is just kinda there in this film. this film never clicks at all.very dry&bland."
1,The Cinematheque of Babylon,"Watching this movie and wondering why it was made and for whom. I cannot escape the thought that perhaps since all the plots have been exhausted and all the movies were made, all that Hollywood has to offer is this. For a while, I was watching thinking that perhaps at some point it will add up to something, but in the end there's nothing, just the waste of brain cells so graphically depicted in what is perhaps the only 'memorable' scene. I may be exagerating a bit, I just remembered there were also a couple of vomit scenes."
4,Definitely entertaining with good special features,"Gruesomely funny film noir is not my favorite genre (though I enjoy Jim Thompson, to whose novels this story owes a lot); but I am a John Cusack fan, which prompted me to see this. Pleasantly surprised, I not only watched the whole film with full attention and the occasional laugh-out-loud, but also watched both alternative endings and all the other special features. Director Harold Ramis has some interesting things to say about independent films and directing in general. As Billy Bob Thornton says in one of the special features, this film isn't about to change anyone's life; it's about entertainment. And it accomplishes that objective with plenty of existential anti-holiday angst to spare."
5,a wonderful little neo-noir existential black comedy from Egon,"saying ""this film didn't know what it wanted to be"" would be like saying the same thing about Shaun of the Dead. both films totally knew what they were going for, and achieved it perfectly.everyone in the cast turns out spectacular performances..from Cusack to Platt, to the lesser seen Randy Quaid and Mike Starr.i can totally understand all the negative reviews. a bleak film is supposed to leave people asking questions, longing for seemingly loose ends to be tied up.but, in the film's defense, that's noir, and to some degree, that's what existentialism is all about...it just happens."
2,How BB Thornton stole Xmas Again..,"For the 2nd time in as many years scrooge Billy Bob Thornton spoils a Christmas movie. This one is thoroughy unoriginal and pointless, about 2 mobsters who rip off their boss on Christmas Eve, and spend the night playing cat and mouse with the boss (Randy Quaid) and his hitman. All the humor is about sex, drunkenness, and violence, mostly dark. John Cusack and Oliver Platt carry the movie for a while, Platt playing a drunk entertainingly, but it's all been done before. If you want something more meaningful for Christmas than topless dancers and trite violence, check out ""The Kid and I"" instead."
3,Worth Watching,"I think the screenplay used for this movie was pretty dark for a comedy, but overall it was an okay movie. I enjoyed the scenery and acting in the film, but there was a lot more sarcasm, nudity, and violence in this movie than I expected. It was a little funny at points, but it had too many depressing elements and character conversations to be entertaining to watch a second time. I think if they cut out a few really depressing scenes and altered the script, it would have been a lot better. It was also a little predictable at points, and the movie's tone was so off-color throughout the film that I am wondering if the nudity or extensive violence is supposed to make up for the sense of hopelessness experienced by many of the characters throughout the movie. Despite the movie's problems, its unique direction and story made it interesting for me to see once."
4,Quirky fun,Solid performances in this offbeat holiday film. Dark Christmas eve tale with surprises. Cusack and Thornton are as fun to watch as ever. Recommending it to friends.
3,Good acting,"Ever since ""High Fidelity"" came out, I've been a big John Cusak fan. Before ""High Fidelity"" I had never really heard of him (I can be a bit out of it sometimes), but after ""High Fidelity"", he has been one of two actors whose face on the box alone can be enough to make me rent a movie. (Kevin Spacey being the other one).Of course that can be a dangerous policy because John Cusak has been in as many stinkers as successes, but fortunately this time around ""The Ice Harvest"" is highly watchable. It's a suspense about a mob lawyer who tries to steal money from his boss, and then finds he can't trust a lot of his friends as well. A lot of dark comedy is thrown in as well. The dark humor aspect of it reminded me slightly of ""Things to do in Denver when you're Dead."" And Billy Bob Thornton is pretty good in this movie also.Not anything I would recommend you go out of your way to see, but if you're looking for a video on a slow Wednesday night, you could do a lot worse."
4,Just missed being great!!,"I felt the movie was a bit slow at times and perhaps this kept it from being a 5 star. The cast was exceptional, as was the director and plot, which incoporated black comedy, with suspense and a good ending. Oliver Platt was terrific. Worth the viewing."
3,Potential That Gets Frozen Somewhere Along The Way,"This movie has genuine moments where you realize this could have been a great movie, or at least a really good one. As it is its decent but little more. John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are inspired casting but even that yields only a few moments of worthwhile screentime. Some funny moments get lost in predictable and usual plot twists. If you like the actors it won't be a total loss for you but this is not going to be a repeat viewing for too many people, watch Grosse Pointe Blank instead if you haven't already."
2,Not very enjoyable... at all,"First off if you like watching John Cusack be charming and funny and basically what his roles usually consist of, you won't like him in this movie. I found his performance hard to watch. Billy bob Thorton was the funniest person in this movie. But not in his typical way, he wasn't the drunk dirty SOB that he usually is, John Cusack was the DRUNK and unfunny guy. There's a lot of drinking and driving which I found was overkill and not really looked at in a laughing manner. The first 45 minutes of this movie were really really hard to watch. It's slow, and boring. The last 10 minutes were the most thrilling part of the movie and that's not what you want to see when watching a movie you want a build up, climax, and conclusion. This movie had a good concept of robbery and moral struggles but it fell flat on its face."
2,*Yawn*,"Certainly you can't go wrong with a movie that starts with guys stealing over 2 million in cash from their boss, right? Wrong! This movie is slow and tedious with completely unremarkable characters. I expected much more from Harold Ramos. This isn't a sleeper hit....just a sleeper."
4,cool,Good movie. Writing is good and actors are spot on.Saw this about five years ago on TV and liked it so I decided to get it on DVD.This is one you could watch once a year and still appreciate it.
2,Grosse Pointe Blank'ish...Not,"I am a huge fan of both Cusack and Billy Bob, however Analyze this and that writer/director Ramis had a pretty shallow script to work with. The movie is entertaining, so it is rentable, but if I were to have seen it at the theaters, I would of come out dissapointed. Cusack and Thorntan play pretty much their regular characters in their movies, Cusack, charming, warm and whitty, whereas Thorntan pretty out there and a little more ecentric. There is a twist at the end, I really didn't see it coming, because it really did not make any real sense. There were no clues that the character involved in the twist had any real relationship until a kind of flashback sequence at the end. I would recommend renting, but I'm not going to buy which is saying a lot because I have a pretty extensive DVD library and again big fans of both lead actors. Their chemistry was much better in Pushing Tin and Cusack tried to pull off a Grosse Pointe Blank (great movie), which didn't work here."
3,Kept me interested that is about it.,The story itself was trying to be a comedy but it was more like a moderate volient gangster drama to me.I don't really like the actors in this film but they did play well.Still there were many turns and unexpected details in the novie which keeps you going. It is good for a look.
2,PLOTLINES & SURPRISES EXPOSED on Menu page!,"This movie isn't awful, could have even been an average, entertaining evening of dark, nasty comedy. However, somebody designed this dvd to GIVE AWAY MOST OF THE SURPRISES AND PLOT TWISTS by showing a 30 second abridgement of the film- including the ending!- before giving the viewer a chance to press PLAY! How STUPID is that?Even if the movie were better and didn't rob it's viewers of any possible element of suspense of surprise, I'd still have to recommend you to the source novel by Scott Phillips. ICE HARVEST is a great read, and excellent period piece that is thrillingly nasty, horrifically violent and dangerously funny if you're bent that way. This film doesnt even come close."
2,Over The Top,"This wickedly black comedy is too violent and dark for my tastes.The only thing I can recommend on the dvd is a hilariousoutake where Billy Bob Thornton goes into his ""Karl"" characterfrom ""Slingblade""in a scene with John Cusack,that will have you in stitches of laughter."
3,another mediocre film teaming cusack and thornton,"the first movie teaming cusack and thornton was pushing tin that i thought was mediocre.with this film,i guess a black comedy, i went in thinking that it was going to be more of a comedy.maybe i just didn't think that most of the moments that were supposed to be funny were.it tries to be sort of a mystery but by the time that i realized it was supposed to be that i didn't care.the movie itself is scuzzy and maybe that was the films intention since it's about lawyers and strippers.as a fan of cusack i found him to be good in it but only really liked one scene of thorntons.oliver platt really is the best thing about this.randy quaid,eventhough he's billed as one of the main stars,is sadly underused,since i know that quaid has it in himself to be more than just some dumb redneck and could be a good character actor.but not here unfortunately.overall it has it's moments but i suggest waiting for cable."
3,"Good, not Great Movie","I'm a John Cusak fan, but I'd never even heard of this movie. The movie is actually pretty good, despite dragging a bit at times. As much as I love Oliver Platt, his role feels unnecessary for the overall storyline of the film. Billy Bob Thornton portrays his character so over the top sneaky and conniving that you know to watch for the proverbial knife in the back somewhere along the way. Not an edge of your seat thriller, but okay for a nothing on T.V. rainy afternoon."
5,Second Sunday in May,"This story had me misty eyed, the emotions and characters leapt from the page. All of the stories in this anthology will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. And Heaven knows, we can all use a little warm and fuzzy in our lives."
4,Great for Ohio history buffs!,"Being an Ohio Mason and a history buff, I found this book fascinating. The book clearly delineates the Masonic tradition (Grand Lodge of Ohio - 1803) and Ohio statehood (1803) and the early relationships between the two from early days for both. The book clearly tracks Masonic progress and issues and not political developments into the 20th century. Although I've not re-read the book in 2 years, I recommend it."
2,DVD Does Not Play,"I bought this book from Amazon, got it and believe strongly that the data is vital to learn, but the $49 price is a cheat if you expect the DVD to work.I will keep the book and study, but the people who thought they could help Garbourgh, author, are cheating her memory and technology.Yes I bought this book from Amazon, have never had a chance to review it formally, trying this"
1,like to have the whole stuff,"I am really sorry, but that's up to now the only way to contact you. I think you don't preview delivery problems, because I couldn't find a rubric to expose my following, from my point of view, simple problem:You sent me the book: the secret of the ring muscles and you charged me the price for the book AND FOR A VIDEO THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TOGETHER. bUT IT DID NOT ARRIVE. SO PLEASE, WHEN DO I GET MY VIDEO TAPE. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE CONTACTED NOT JUST BY A PREFABRICATED COMPUTER ANSWER.With not very high respect, Peter"
5,Boat leather cleaner,We have bought a 1998 jet boat. She's been around awhile. The seats and custions showed it. This cleaner not only cleaned it but softened some of the dryed out spots. Did need to use one of those scrubby sponges to get tough scuff marks out. All in all very pleased.
2,Average,"The product barley does any cleaning on the vinyl, but smells nice. Does NO restoration whatsoever. If you're getting this to make you boat cushions look relatively new again, then don't waste your time or money."
1,Dyson Vacuum hose replacement,"This item did not fit my Dyson vacuum cleaner, even though it was advertised as a suitable replacement part. The release buttons for the vacuum wand were too small to operate properly, and I plan on returning it to the vendor."
4,Great value,"This item is well worth the $15.00, rather than $40.00 thru Dyson. Dyson replaced my original hose for free. Their replacement was all grey (not a real Dyson hose), did not stretch as far as the original, and lasted less than 1 year. I figured for $15.00 this was worth a try. As stated in other reviews, it is tight fitting, especially the first time you install it. Once you've used it & stretched it out a few times,it gets easier to take off and put back on. I would buy this item again."
2,Cheap plastic,"Pros: The hose was cheaper than the genuine Dyson one. It seems to slip easier on and off the wand when you extend it.Cons: CHEAP plastic. One time my Dyson tipped over and the hook which holds the electric cord broke off. Now I have nowhere to wrap the cord! Also, it's not the same yellow color, but that is just a cosmetic issue."
2,Buy only the original Dyson,I have tried 2 generics and both will not stay attached at the bottom. Also the hose does not slide on and off as well have the original dyson.
1,CHEAP PIECE OF CHIT,"It failed after 60 days. The yellow connector fails, and will not stay in so you cannot use your vacuum. Do not EVEN waste your time or money. Go to the Dyson web site and get the real one."
1,Spend the money for real thing!,"This hose does not work on my DC14. The hose slides out of the wand because the spring ring is too weak and will not engage the groove of the wand. Also, the top of the hose will not stay in the handle!!"
1,Does Not Fit!,"This was supposed to fit my DYSON DC-07 but did not latch into the Vacuum body. The connector is Yellow, while my old hose connector was a different color."
4,Liked it; Loved the Okinawa Longevity Plan,"I really wanted to give this 4.5 half stars and the only reason that i'm not giving it five is that I think that the Willcoxs' first book The Okinawa Longevity Plan is better. It covers total mind body giving a more complete picture of the contributing factors that lead to a longer healthier life. Also included in the longebity plan is what the authors call ""east-west fusion"" recipes that are more palatable to western tastes.Now that aside I did like the recipes and half tried almost 2/3 of those. My favorite is the red curry. So often when i'm looking for a curry recipe it calls for coconut milk. I was very pleased to find a curry recipe based on tomatoes. I also like the sweet-sour mustard baked tofu. Talk about Fast! wow! The recipes do really taste good, but I did find that some of the ingrediants were had to find locally in Michigan, but there are very good interet stores that will ship.So give it a try. I really think that you'll enjoy it."
3,Just another diet book,"This is a fair diet book, but seems to be a lot of words to say what needs to be said. More that anything it's a money maker for the author."
1,Pseudo Science,"What a morass of conflicting data! First it's this much soy, then that much. Then the 100 year olds are still in their prime because of an oil that was only invented in Canada 20 years ago.What a sorry state that this book could even get printed much less reach popular status. Kaayla Daniel, author of THE WHOLE SOY STORY has written an excellent summary of the problems with this book here on Amazon as well as of THE CHINA STUDY, another sorry attempt to push a dietary agenda by ""cooking statistics."" While it's certainly good to eat your vegetables, be cautious about switching to a high soy diet based on pseudo scientific claims."
5,Excellent!,"Prompt delivery, in excellent condition for low price. Cant beat it! I ordered 2 similar books and they came a day apart.My research is on foods of various countries and the longevity of there people. Kawasaki is an island off of Japanin which the elders live longer than on the mainland, and longer than those in the rest of the world. They eat mostly fish and sea vegetables."
4,Interesting book if you're into nutrition,"This is a very good book with good recipes. I think you need to be interested in nutrition and diet to find it a good read. However, considering the average American diet, perhaps it should be a required text in all high schools. Some of the recipes call for ingredients that are difficult to find unless you live in an area with a large Japanese population."
5,"Ballad of the Irish Horse, Music CD, The Chieftains","This is an excellent music CD. One can actually ""hear"" the horses prancing in the music."
1,Not received,"This item not received. What more can I say, but you say I must say so many words. Ah, I made it."
5,Personal tribute to Henri Fabre,"Since I was a student in the late 1940s Henri Fabre has been one of my heroes. I have had his book of collected observations on the intimate lives of insects since that time. The book was so over used that it badly needed replacing,and I was very pleased to see that it is still in print. It was my pleasure, in 1983, to visit Fabre's House and property in Provence, now a small museum. The museum retains atmosphere of a private place - I and my wife were the only visitors at the time; his desk, microscope and the big black hat remain in the room where he did many of his observations; as do, in a large glass case, the very large collection of natural objects (unrelated to insects) that he amassed in the course of his long life. In a lower floor are exhibited the many letters he received from admiring scientists, including Darwin."
2,NO ILLUSTRATIONS!!!,"Warning, there is not one picture in this book save a crappy watercolored cricket on the cover. There was an earlier edition with exquisite illustrations, so I thought I'd take a chance with this one. *sound of gameshow buzzer* I'm sorry, no pictures. Anyway it is a good book, I enjoyed it. It's not a scientific description of insects and their habits, it's a regular guy's observations of and adventures with the insect world throughout his life and it's pretty interesting. It was Surrealist director Luis Bunuel's favorite book, although his copy had illustrations!!!"
3,Useful to clear up cultural confusions,"Although it wasn't exactly what I expected, this dictionary is pretty good when it comes to defining cultural terms and names. I use it to decipher lyrics to classical music, and it gives pretty good depth to the concept behind the word. The biggest difficulty is being able to spell and pronounce the word, since transliterating hindi and sanskrit lexicon can be done in many ways. I guess this is the best it can get, though, since it is your only option. In a nutshell: It's useful but sometimes tedious."
1,tripe,"Be aware. This book is dealing with an important topic but in a very conservative fashion. If you like writers like Diane Ravitch, Michael Gurian (Wondor of Boys) and ED Hirsch (Cultural Literacy) you might like this book. If you have any progressive ideas at all and like writers like Theodore Sizer (Horace's Compromise), Alfie Kohn (The Schools Our Children Deserve) or God forbid, Rousseau!, be aware that she is not only blasting feminists in her book but progressive thinkers throughout history. She even goes so far as to blame my old friend John Tinker (Tinker vs. Des Moines School District) for ""the beginning of the end of effective school discipline.""If you want a better understanding of boys growing up today, I would stick with William Pollack's ""Real Boys"" or Kindlon & Thompson's ""Raising Cain"". If you want conservative, reactionary tripe, go with Sommers.(FYI -I have been an educator for nearly 30 years and have never written a book review until this book made me mad enough to do so.)"
5,Good job as far as it goes,"As a black man, I find that the trepidations from a white female dominated education system are hardest felt by our young black males. The truth of the matter is that the educational system has little input from any males let alone a black male. The female perspective is important but should not be a monopoly today any more than the male viewpoint once dominated."
5,This is what I call Speaking Truth to Power,"Sommers will get nothing but trouble from the dominant media culture for daring to expose the war against boys (and against truth, facts, and reason) certain hyperfeminists waged throughout the nineties. We need more courageous voices like Sommers' in this Country if we are ever going to expose the endlessly perpetuated lies of the left, and the real harm their policies continue to cause."
4,Well researched + well written = A very good book,"This is a book that is both scholarly engaging and accessible to the general public. Arguments are clear, as is her criticism of the gendered feminist standpoint."
3,"In total agreement...with the statistics, not the sniping","I love the point behind this book. I truely believe that the feminist movement in this country is, in many ways, way out of control (perhaps this is a good place to mention that I am female!). However, I had issues with the fact that the author seemed as concerned with making her arch-nemisis, Gilligan, look like an inept, deceptive fool as she was about debunking the arguments. Also, she's pretty repetitive in her arguments in places. I wonder if she was being paid by the word? All in all, good ideas, only so-so follow through. I would suggest readers try Warren Farrell's ""The Myth of Male Power"" first."
5,The War Against Boys,A must read book for EVERYONE with boys. Find out how the gender feminists are causing boys to fail. Equality is not their goal!!
4,"Boy's mother""s must","If you are a mother of boys, then this a must. It is well written and easy to follow. It is helpful guide as young men face the world of feminism and how as mothers we can help."
4,Very informative,"As a mother of 2 girls and 1 boy I was looking for answers. This book provided insight and analysis I found very enlightening.Easy to follow dispite the deeper analysis and the statistics are explained in detail.This has to be one of the better ""sociology"" type books i've read this year."
5,Only a woman could write this,"No man could get away with telling this truth. Much like racial issues, the pendulem in America has swung too far. The results of this make it hard on boys and girls alike. Boys punished by the system for being masculine, and girls criticized by their peers for being too feminine. This book also ties in well with the Rise and Fall of the American Teenager and the Unreality Industry."
1,Poorly researched using half-truths and misleading data,"As a proud, married American male, I find this female author's book insulting to men (and women). The mere thought that we can blame issues such as child abandonment (by Fathers) on feminism is stupid. Women through the centuries who have had the nerve to stand up for their equal rights are not to blame ...We as REAL MEN need to face up to OUR shortcomings and fix them. Being a strong man & having a strong woman as your lifepartner (or friend, or sister, or mother) is a sign of your comfort with your masculinity --not a weakness. The kind of thinking that went into this book gives wifebeaters and the like the weapon they need to further insult & hold down our sisters, wives and daughters. This book is a JOKE!"
1,Misguided book,"Christina attempts to make a variety of points, many with some merit. The problem is that she overlooks the basic components of feminism: the quest for equality. Sure, more women go to college and do their homework... why are women getting lower standardized test scores? Her arguments jump from point A to C without concidering point B as a factor.And feminism does acknowledge the problems that are facing the boys in this country. The culture of violence and machoism is one of the things that causes men to die (on average) younger than women. That is something that true feminists address. Fix the violence and sexism and we'll all be smarter and live longer."
1,this book is garbage,"For anyone that cares about achieving true gender equality, read this book only to learn more about what you're up against. The author pretends to be presenting revolutionary ideas but instead is reinforcing the same old patriarchal, mysoginist, anti-progressive ways that women and men alike have fought so hard to reconstruct. Don't be fooled!"
1,Psychological fascism,"Sommers fails to take responsibility for her baseline models of gendered ""normality""; thus, her book is yet another reactionary defense of the societal status quo -- pure level-headed formalism without an idea in its head, emotional wreckage be damned. If we want things to get better for our boys *and* girls, we'll need the courage and intelligence to resist such attractive but utterly vapid ""thought."""
1,lets move on,"this book just reifies the old boy/girl dichotomy. we have to move on from finger pointing to some real issues. are we really to believe that boys are being harmed by feminism? poor things... is there really anything inherent in being a boy or girl. We know that there is not, so how can people still be making these passe and inflamatory arguments. Give me a break."
4,Cogently argued,"It can take many decades for an ill in society to be recognised, accepted and corrected. The position of women in modern America is one such ill. Notwithstanding the fact that there is still much to be done it must also be remembered that parts of the problem can be 'over-corrected'.In this book Sommers demonstrates that the solution to gender discrimination is not just to help one sex, both sexes have their own (as well as shared) problems and both need to be addressed equally and appropriately if the progress that has been made in the past is to be continued in the future.The book is cogently argued and the key assertions back up by solid research. For those who are interested in the position of males in society this is a excellent and well balanced work; a refreshing antidote to the many reactionary or anti-feminist tomes that have appeared in the last couple of years."
3,Doesn't have DREAM ON by Aerosmith,"Although this sound track does have ""The Reaper"" by Blue Oyster Cult, which is a good song. The best song in the movie was at the end when the U.S. wins the gold and they play Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" but ""Dream On"" isn't on this CD!!! :("
1,The Power is Missing,"A great movie, with great music, and great script. Casting was superb.I watch this with my 8 year old grandson who is empowered by its magic and miracle.I just jumped on net to order soundtrack and found that Dream On is missing. What a tradegy to cheat the public of such a song that was the eternal identifier and the guts of the movie.Somebody screwed up. Where are they working now?Bill"
2,Redeemed by the last track ............................,"Track 4 seems to borrow from Chris Spheeris a bit too much (who, for all I know, may have borrowed from someone else). But whereas Chris Spheeris is consistently tasteful, most of Omar's tunes are made a little too grandiose. This is probably caused by not having an experienced producer.Sensitivity is the missing ingredient on this cd, except on the title track, a nice melody with a nice rhythm, which is definitely worth buying."
5,"GREAT MUSIC, LOVED IT!",This is a great album. Omar is one of the greatest pianist out there! I am recommending him to all my friends.
5,Continued Excellence,"This is the first recording of Shostakovich's string quartets I've ever heard, and it remains one of my favorites. The quality of the music and the performances were enough that it immediately drew me into this music I knew nothing about, enough to make it seem familiar. Even though I've heard no other recording of these quartets, it's not hard to determine that these are first rate, with flawless performances doubled by their strong conviction that occasionally takes away the breath."
5,Great string quartets,"If you like chamber music and Shostakovich or you dont know his music, the quartets are great-melodic, rhythmic not hard to listen to.The price was right and delivery very fast."
4,Old/New,"Background orchestration supports and doesn't overwhelm the vocals, which range from modern pop to old-style Haitian.It's this blend of old and new which gives Emeline Michel an unexpectedly contemporary style - hard to pin down to a single trend, yet compelling."
1,MUNDANE READING,"Nothing interesting here at all. Very mundane, predicatble monologues. No interesting stories at all. Even the Dan Quayle stories fall flat. As boring as a Midwestern landscape."
2,"Good Acting, But Story Got a Bit Ridiculous","James Earl Jones is great as always. But the plot stumbles after the boat crashes into the dock. The story veers into contrived and, by the end, absurd plot developments (the final scene inexplicably has James Earl Jones walking on water). I think the makers of this movie tried too hard to jam too many liberal dogmas about race relations into one movie. James Earl Jones walked on water, I suppose, because black people are Jesus-like saviors of white people. Curiously, Jones is a light-skinned black, but the part seemed to call for a dark-skinned black -- the flashback scenes draw viewers' attention to this discrepancy."
5,End to a great story arc,"Much anticipated end to a great story arc. I was one of probably the few people who was upset when Kikyo was killed, but I thought it was a bold and needed addition to the story. The Band of Seven had some great and memorable characters who also showed some depth. This entire arc showed some true progression of character developement and story. It was a truly satisfying disc."
1,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,"REPETITIVE REPETITIVE... After the first 26 volumes or so, it gets kind of BOORRINNG!!!!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY."
2,A Hard Ride - Careful,This particular blade cuts on the push stroke and is terrible to work with. Buy the regular ones that cut on the pull and the cuts will be smooth and clean.
4,Great reading especially if you're SCA,"This book was very interesting. I was present for many of the events described and I know many of the people, both those listed by name and those who the author leaves anonymous. For me that was what made the story that much more interesting; to see his viewpoint made my own memories clearer. This book holds valuable lessons for any who aspire to peerage. I also found his brief overview of the other reenactment groups to be very educational. -- Hersker (Master) Danr Bjornsson, currently of Atlantia & formerly of Midrealm, mka Don Willadsen"
5,"Required Reading For ""New or Wannabe's""","I should have written a looong time ago. I've added an extra copyto our Canton 'Library"" just to loan out to new people or topeople who wonder ""what are you DOING""! Some things are differentfrom Kingdom to Kingdom but as a whole the ""Dream"" is the same allover. Buy it...read it!"
5,buy this. now.,"Every now and then, I stumble across a new band that changes my life. I bought the latest Reckless Kelly album, and amazon thoughtfully suggested I buy some Cross Canadian Ragweed as well . . . I did, and I've since bought everything they've done, seen them live, and become a much happier person. I cannot even begin to tell you how good this band is, and I am NOT a country music fan. This is what country music SHOULD sound like. While I love every single song they've done, this album is probably the best first album to get. Anyone who doesn't like this album doesn't really like music. A warning, however: don't buy this one unless you're also prepared to buy all their others. Because you will want to."
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"This album is great, it's Country music with Attitude and Big Brass Ones!!!! I would recommend this album to anyone who loves thier Country music delivered with a punch."
1,X3D TV Transformer is a joke,"This product is a joke. I tried for a few hours to see 3D images,it just blurred the image of my TV. The remote also does not workunless you are very close to the X3D box. The manufacturer claimsit can transform the HD in 3D HD. The box doesn't even have acomponent or DVI input to process the HD signal."
1,Come on Amazon,"I'm really annoyed because the 3rd suite does not load. The titles load but the Scythian Suite is instead played twice, the first time under the Cinderella titles and then again under the proper titles. I bought this recording specifically for the complete suites.UGH!"
5,deluxe router case,"I was very happy with everything about my new Bosch 1617EVS router except the fact that it didn't come with a case. (My workshop doubles as my garage, so everything has to get put away every so often, so my wife can park her car in the ""garage."") Originally, I wasn't happy about having to pay extra for this case, but when the item arrived, I got over the initial sticker shock.The case is very solidly built and wide enough that it won't tip over if you hit it with something. (That's a problem with a lot of the other plastic tool cases I have.) Inside, it has space for the router as well as collet wrenches and a number of 1/2"" and 1/4"" bits.Interestingly, the case holds the router upside down -- but since that's how my routers spend most of their time when they're not in the cases, I guess they're used to it.If you have a 1617 or 1618 router and need to transport it or just want to keep it out of harm's way, you can't do better than this attractive, sturdy, and functional case."
3,"Good case, could be improved","I ordered the Bosch 1618EVS D-handle router and wanted a case to store it and miscellaneous accessories in. The case is solid and sturdy, but it would be better if the designer simply thought about what came with the router and how can the case accommodate the storage for that gear. The router came with the wrenches, 1/2"" and 1/4"" collet, extra base plate screws, template guide adapter, and manual.The case was designed perfectly for the router and the wrenches, but no designated space for the extra collet, screws, template guide adapter and manual. I would also like to see storage for Bosch templates. For me, the space for the router bits is a waste as I keep those in a separate box. I do like the space for the edge guide, but you almost have to disassemble it to fit it into the case.Again it is a good solid case that will protect your router, but it could of been designed better."
3,Do I really need it?,"The Case came as part of the package. I do like to keep things together so planned to keep it in the Case. I quickly learned that putting every thing back in the case was a bit of a project. I don't take tools out of my shop and I found that it was impractical for me to use the case. For the person going from job to job, it is tough, protects the router and accessories for set up very well. I wound up getting rid of my case because I was not using it and it took up shop space."
4,Big on storage,"The case I ordered for my second router does the job....I was surprised to see that it's thicker then the case for the combo (same router with a 2nd plunge base), but it has more options to store extra bits as well. Not much to say except I like to keep my tools protected when not in use and well organized...this one works the way it should.Bosch...keep up the good work....I wish they had storage cases for all their products.Don"
5,I liked this game quite a bit,They should make a sequel because the plot is not finished.I liked this game quite a bit.
3,Poor technical quality,"The transfer is poor, with lots of noise and blemishes. It is ""wide screen"" but not anamorphic, rather it is letterboxed.The subtitles, in Chinese and English, are not the normal DVD style but are hard-coded in the image. They are hard to read, being low-resolution and coming with the video transfer, rather than being fit for the digital format. Worse, they are always white with no shadow, regardless of the image background, so sometimes they cannot be seen against the picture. Also, they are poorly translated and unproofed, so even when I can read them they often don't make any sense."
1,The Chinese Feast movie dvd,The dvd arrived damaged and not playable. We returned it to Amazon and still have not received charge card credit. Can you check into the credit situation for us. A replacement copy may have been the better option if we had known the slow credit processing. Kind response from Amazon would be much appreciated.William Chang
1,POOR,THIS IS ALL REGIONS DVD BUT IT DOESNT PLAY ON MY ALL REGIONS. A LITTLE THAT I COULD WATCHT DIDNT MAKE SENCE. POOR ACTING.
4,EMER Kenny Strikes gold with her Alt Harp music.,"Here is the heart of modern Celtic: with the folk swayings of the homeland, the techno soft popping beat of instruments blending in with harp, and the fusion of old and new style Celtic. If you are thinking: 'putting me to sleep' harp,' then you will be vastly disappointed: while ethereal and dreamily asethic, Emer has the ability to fuse softly flowing jazz rhythms with classical guitar, backed by multi-tracked angelic sounding vocals."
4,hypnotic irish female trance love music,"i first heard emer kenny while at my massage therapists. perfect for massage and sex! great use of vocals, trancelike beats and unique instruments- if you go for cocteau twins, vanessa dau and ambient sounds, this will be one you won't regret purchasing!!! listen to the samples- i was hooked."
3,Average and overpriced,"This book offers a good intro for someone just entering the field of digital video transport; however, for a well exposed individual operating in this space, it is weak. As my background is in digital signal processing and comm systems, I have read and seen better materials, because of this I have to consider it as extremely overpriced. Its worth in my opinion is at most $80.00."
3,Dated,"Dated, Dated, Dated, if you need to repair your 20 year ol TV or cassette player than buy it otherwise just toss your aging electronics and buy a Ipad or laptop"
1,Don't Buy this book,I'll try to be short. Don't buy this book. I have knowledge in electronics and he just states some plain wrong facts as to testing components in circuits. The writing is terrible. I don't know who calls this guy an expert ( and he may be) but he does not know how to explain things. Buy this book if you want to remain clueless in repairing electronics. DO NOT BUY!!!! I would have rated it 0 but it wouldn't let me.
2,"Disappointing, old info, Not very helpful","I do have this book and it is a disappointment. It list some problems you may have and some steps to try. But if your problem is not listed in the examples your kind of stuck. Trying to list the problems and steps to take that can come up with the millions of consumer electronics devices is not going to work. I don't know what is, but this book doesn't really do what the title says. I have some other H.Davidson books and they are not that helpful. There seems to be a bag of tricks you can try when repairing things. i.e. ESR meter, flowcharts, curve tracer, overheating chip, call the manufacture, etc. But when those don't work I think you have to study how the circuit works and understand what is happening and what happens when certain parts fail. This can take a long time. Maybe there is a better system, but it is not in this book."
5,Mysteries: Ancient & Modern,This was a very informative and fun book to read. Lots of facts I did not know and a new way of looking at a lot of ideas I was already aware of.
3,It's alright,"Papo hits, and misses on their figures, and this one was a miss at least for me.The detail isn't as sharp as many of the other animals they make, and even with the nice paint job the lack of detail shows through.I gave this one away so not to have to look at it anymore."
5,da bears,The bear is a great addition to my collection of chicago bears collectibles.It will be perfect next to my devin hester thropy case.
4,Rasta No Fool!,"I could't believe no one had reviewed this album! I just bought this disc a few weeks ago and can't stop playing it. If you are a lover of classic dubstyle-roots-reggae, GET THIS! Not only does it contain a lost classic album from one of the premier harmony trios of Jamacia but it also contains the only kind of bonus tracks real reggae fans care about:DUBS!! Yes this set gives you a killer dub of the title track but they also give you some tracks from another classic out of print album from the 70's called Night Food and the dub versions. Long live The Heptones!!!!"
2,Got the OS X Part,"This package is a lot like that ice cream you get at the super market that looks great in the case and then you eat like half the carton before you realize you are being tantalized by something that has been ruthlessly pumped full of air. There are many things in this book that offensively wrong (like encouraging people to use System.out.println). On the whole, this is aimed squarely at the santa's elves market of would-be Java VBers."
3,Flawed but still interesting,"While by no means the best Bava movie(my vote is for Black Sabbath) nor the worst(Lisa and the Devil) Hachet for the Honeymoon is an essential purchase or at least viewing for fans of his. Its about a wealthy fashion designer who feels he must commit murder to regain a supressed memory of who killed his mother on her wedding night. Bava also bings some style into the mix(the 1st murder, the victim's face reflected in the hatchet blade, and the persistant ghost). However, being that Hatchet is baddly dated, a predictable ending, and slow first half really mar interest for one of Bava's more underrated works. Gore hounds should look elsewhere as well because Hatchet is PG rated. The dvd transfer is average and not very special."
3,Flawed but still interesting,"While by no means the best Bava movie(my vote is for Black Sabbath) nor the worst(Lisa and the Devil) Hachet for the Honeymoon is an essential purchase or at least viewing for fans of his. Its about a wealthy fashion designer who feels he must commit murder to regain a supressed memory of who killed his mother on her wedding night. Bava shows his black-as-night sense of humor(""How sad, another bride killed, sad. But fortunately, she paid for her wedding dress in advance."") and also bings some style into the mix(the 1st murder, the victim's face reflected in the hatchet blade, and the persistant ghost). However, being that Hatchet is baddly dated, a predictable ending, and slow first half really mar interest for one of Bava's more underrated works. Gore hounds should look elsewhere as well because Hatchet is PG rated. The dvd transfer is average and not very special."
4,Don't bury the Hatchet,"From the mind of the Italian master Mario Bava comes another fantastic of madness and murder. One could enjoy this movie for his direction alone. The sharp edits and distortions against his fluid camera style enspire new depths of fear in this film. Needless to say, character depth (aside from the crazed mind of the main character) is not his movies strong point. But you're sure to enjoy the surprises and twists as you watch the clever inspector try and figure out who is behind the murder spree. Some may find it a little light on gore (especially if you're a Fulci fanatic ;), but Bava doesn't disapoint in this twisted story where a psychotic's only relief comes from hacking up virginal brides (et al.)"
2,Not worth it,"I returned this book. If you are familiar with Struts don't waste your time on this book. If you are learning Struts I recommend you try other works. As to the other technologies, such as OJB, this book does not cover them in enough depth to warrant a purchase."
4,Good start for Struts beginners,This book summarizes Struts and some other technologies related. It can bring you to lot of save times in your beginnigs because It exposes a professional point of view front the use of these technologies and patterns. Not Struts beginners don't purcharse it.
2,May be good for England....,"I purchased this book as I'm planning a trip to Scotland this summer. However, I was sorely disappointed in the disproportion of the areas of bed and breakfasts referenced. The book is almost 400 pages long; nearly 300 of these pages are for England, but only 20 pages are for Scotland and another 20 are for Wales. In total there are only 60 B&Bs listed for Scotland; many regions aren't represented at all, and the major cities have only a few listed (Glasgow, the largest city in the country, only has one listing!). I'm highly disappointed that a broader sample of B&Bs couldn't be listed, and will not be taking this book with me on vacation. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one was because of the large number of entries for England, which may be helpful to others."
5,A Childhood Favorite!,"Although I am biased about the author, because he was the Prinbcipal of my Elementary School, I have to say this was one of my favorite stories when I was a little girl!It is very engaging, exciting and mysterious... just scarey enough to keep young boys (& girls) interest, without being too much. Now that I work at a small private school, I am ordering several copies for my 3rd and 4th graders classroom libraries.I can't wait to have a group discussion with these kids after they read the book!"
3,Trapped in Death Cave,"I enjoyed reading Trapped in Death Cave. It is a mystery book and I like mysteries. Gary, Brian and Mrs. Becker get trapped in the cave by Odie Wilson, who wants the gold hidden there all to himself. Everyone thinks Mrs. Becker is a witch but when she ends up saving the lives of two boys they have a party for her. Then they close off the cave so no one will go back.I would recommend this book to kids under the age 12."
3,Scary with a Simple Plot,"This was one of the first books I read outside of school. The cover art and title made me curious and I read it when I was 9 or 10 years old. For a child's book it accomplishes everything an English teacher would want except the characters are one dimensional, but that cannot be helped due to its small size.The plot and story are good involving some grandkids that were visiting their grandparents when their grandpa has died. Next one of the grandkids is kidnapped and the plot thickens."
3,trapped,a boys grandpa dies on a boat and everyone believes it was a acident but he finds a note saying they are gold in a cave and the boy goes to find it to prove he was killed and they are a woman living in the cave.
3,"Two friends, buried treasure, evil sheriff, etc...","I remember reading this book when I was a young lad. It was well written, but I remember thinking that it was very boring, and I was quite a bookworm! Not a bad pickup for three bucks, but there is probably a lot more out there."
1,Obvious,"Gary's Grampa recently died. Everyone thinks it was a fishing accident, but Gary is sure he was murdered, by someone who wants to claim the gold Grampa was on the verge of finding. He left behind a note for Gary and a map showing the places he'd already searched.Gary enlists his best friend Brian to help him search both for the gold and for his Grampa's killer.The first time you meet him, it is clear who the villain in this story is. The description is so heavy-handed, it is impossible to be surprised by his identity. The ending of this book is a bit too neat, too, with everyone ending up so satisfied. There was no room for suspense or surprise in this story."
5,Sweet...,"Ah... I love using this saw. It is so well balanced, quiet, precision made, and will cut through just about anything without flinching. It's a piece of cake to change blades, although it sounds like the blade removal handle is going to break when you tighten in the blade [it makes a loud ""click""]. The orbital cutting action will move the saw through thick stock extraordinarily fast. It is definitely a nice tool to use. I highly recommend it."
4,Like a flat-blade screwdriver,"This is probably the most universal tool I own. Ever ripped a 2x6x8 with a jigsaw by eyeball? I did and will still be amazed for months to come. This is a fine tool for those who need a quick grab and go saw. The progresser blades are evil and will cut through almost anything. Choose a T101DP blade for a smoother cut though. Bosch sold me on their products with this saw. I have yet to find another tool by any manufacturer to impress me as much. I gave it a 4 because of the locking handle makes me feel like I'm doing damage on every blade change. And although it is a good saw and probably worth the $, it's still an expensive jigsaw."
5,Super Saw,"After putting it off for newarly fifteen years, I purchased this saw about a year ago. It exceeded my expectations--and my expectations were rather lofty. With the Bosch blades, and the variable speed, this saw is a real go-getter. There are reviews on it in some of the wood working and handyman magazines and they verify my experience."
5,What can I add?,"I bought this saw because of all the reviews written here--and have not been disappointed. It is a great tool, and I'm headed out to the lumber yard today to buy some wood to build sutff with my hot new Bosch. My only gripe is that the kit comes with ten or so blades, but with no explanation about what material they are designed to cut. The manual's full instruction about how to choose speed, cut type, and blade amounts to, ""you'll figure it out."" I sure would appreciate more ""how to cut"" advice, as I have so far been unable to get a square cut with curves on a treated pine 2 X 6. I expect it's my technique, not the saw. But still, I'd like to know more about how to really master this wonderful piece of equipment."
5,Top notch,"You can't buy a better jigsaw without buying an industrial grade tool. Even then, I would have my doubts that you would be getting a better saw. The average working Joe will not live long enough or use it often enough to wear this puppy out."
5,Cuts great!,"This saw is the best you can get. It has a lot of power, and the quick change blade clamp is easy to use. It also cuts very accurately. However, it gets warm pretty easily."
5,Great Buy for the Money,"Just bought this jigsaw last week, my old craftsman wasn't ""cutting"" it any more. What a difference between the two. The quick blade change system takes a little getting use to, the blades are expensive but worth it. The case provided holds everything together including extra blades. Hands down, this is one sweet saw. Every professional I've talked to, states that if you're going to buy a jigsaw, get a Bosch. They were right. Most of my other tools are either Delta or PC, but this Bosch Jigsaw was definitely worth the money. No question, if I had to buy a second jigsaw, it would be a Bosch."
4,Good saw,"A good saw to work with, blows the saw dust away. Get the one with the metal case. It takes a little practice to change the blades; but after you have changed a few, then no problem......"
1,"Fine saw, if you can stand the blade-change system","The saw functions fine once you get a blade in, so I won't talk about that. The blade changing system is very awkward. Every other jig saw made (even cheap ones) have much more convenient ways to get a blade in and out. This saw requires you to pull up on the black thing on top of the handle, turn it three times CCW, insert the blade sideways, rotate the blade straight, turn handle three times CW until is snaps (it sounds like it's broken). Now even this might be tolerable, except that the black thing on the handle does not snap down good and spins around while you'r trying to use the saw. It also is prone to just breaking off (seen several). Go somewhere else for a saw. This one is not worth the trouble."
2,Bosch has a trigger switch problem in my opinion,I really liked my bosch jigsaw quiet smooth strong but!!!!! between putting new triger switches in it and my bosses bosch drills a fellow could go to the poor house when i first bought the jigsaw trigger went bad in first month boss has jig saws and drills all have had trigger switch problems bosch charges a hefty price for repair no more bosch tools in our shop back to dewalt always dependable
3,Blade change - it's a pain!,"I've bought this saw based entirely on... reviews. Five stars! Cool! But after I received 1587 I encountered the annoying problem with blade change. And after I visited Tool Forum at Bosch's web site and searched for ""1587"", I found that this problem is typical for this model. (I did it in the mid of June 2001; with time content of the forum may change). Now I'm thinking about return of the tool. On the other hand, if you eventually lock a blade (it may take minutes of rotating the knob on saw's handle) the sawing goes pretty well."
5,Fast and accurate jig saw,"The difference between this jig saw and a 30 year old jig saw I had been using is dramatic. The Bosch cuts very fast and smooth with almost no vibration. I don't have a tapered blade so cutting a small arc or circle was not as easy but very fast with the blade I was using. It has good dust control, adjustable, to keep the dust off the cut line. Worked very good in plastic with no chipping. The one thing I did have problems with was the plastic handle for tightening the blade. If you pull it up briskly it will come off in your hand. It seemed to go back in when forced and still works so I guess I didn't break anything, but be careful when pulling it up to change blades."
1,No tone or bass controls,"This is at best an inconvenient system to use and at worst it is unmanagable. I should have investigated this system more closely prior to purchase, but for the price I assumed it would have bass and treble controls. It has none and the bass is often times overwhelming. The display is inadequate and to see ""normal"" info (track, time, etc) displayed you need to have your TV on.It also has major input/output deficiences. For example the only other audio output is the headphone jack which silences the rest of the system.This is my first Samsung product and I am extremely disappointed."
3,Out of Copyright - NOT a bootleg,"Despite what the previous reviewer said, this is NOT a ""bootleg"" copy. The original copyright for this book was 1922. According to US copyright law, any book published BEFORE 1923 is now out of copyright, in the public domain and ANYONE can reprint it if they wish. After that the copyright laws are a bit more complicated ~ but before 1923 is definitely out of copyright. (Copyright does not last forever :-))Disclaimer - I do not have a copy of this reprint, have any opinion on its quality, or have anything to do with its publishing."
5,Smooth cutting. Sawdust stays off your line.,"I'm even cutting curves confidently with these Bosch blades in my saw. I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve. It hardly even needed sanding. I run my saw about mid speed with these. Once they start biting, it's silky smooth. Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk. Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that. I'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades. The handsaw stays in the closet much more. With the blades I used to ""try"" to use, the cutting line was always covered in sawdust. Impossible to work that way. These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line, the way its supposed to be."
5,superior cuts,"Sometimes you just have to pay more for the best! I wish I could get these cheaper, but at least I know that I am going to get clean, accurate, splinter-free cuts in hard- or soft-woods. Never a cut-quality problem with any of Bosch's jig saw blades, and no complaints about durability either. I don't even buy other brands at clearance prices anymore."
2,Not so Super,"Some good advice unfortunately offset by some questionable instructions, e.g. suppositories if you are too lazy to wait for your dog to relieve itself, dragging the leash as a means of training, flea collars so toxic that they should be taken off in confined areas. On balance, this book probably does as much harm as good."
4,Great puppy starter book,"Good book for starting out, gives you all the ins and outs of choosing the right puppy for you and what is expected of you as a pet owner. Lots of helpful tips on training correctly the first time. Wish I had this book before I made my mistakes, now I am looking for a book that helps me correct the bad habits I have instilled in my little one. I highly recommend buying this book prior to getting your puppy so you can do it right the first time and not have to figure out how to fix the bad habits you taught your new puppy. Two thumbs up!!!!!"
5,Best reference book for raising a puppy,"Daniel Pinkwater's brilliant humorous prose has been a favorite of mine for years, but this book is also incredibly sound and practical. I have now known three puppies to be raised into excellent, loving, well-behaved dogs using this as a reference. Highly recommended."
2,Nice and Easy?,"There really is no ""nice and easy"" approach to learning this language. It's difficult to learn without hearing it and being around it every day. Some of their consonants are so slurred, you almost have to see a person saying it to grasp it. This book isn't awful or anything, but there are much better products out there for attempting quick conversational Portuguese."
1,disconnect your woofers before listening,rumble (not subway sounds) make 1st whole segment unlistenable without disconnecting subwoofers or filtering--not exactly why you buy an sacd
1,Trite and immature and wholly uninteresting characters.,"The one star goes to the first novella which at least built toward something. The second novella is so bad and the characters are so thin, it's no wonder every thought that enters the female character's head is followed by an exclamation point! Characters address each other by first names all the time ( apet peeve of mine), as if they've got severe mental lapses and need to say the name over and over again. There's not a serious intimate thought in this book! And the way she butchered the setting! How anyone can make Paris boring is beyond me, but Kudos to Prose for doing such! Kudos!!!"
1,Complete disappointment,"Having eclectic tastes in music, I often will pick up something about which I know nothing. This usually involves ethnic styles from the world community. After learning the ""Csardas"" was a Hungarian folk style, I found this item on Amazon.com and bought it on spec, so to speak. To my horror, I found the lead violin to be lackluster at best, and the accompanying orchestration to be chaotically cacophonous. After listening to this CD twice - very attentively, I did something that I had never done before. I threw it in the trash. Considering that I have purchased around 300 CDs, mostly from Amazon.com, over the past decade or so, I would consider that an adequate expression of my revulsion. I think I'll try Turkish folk music next...."
3,czardas,Hello there. Some body can help me please. I am looking the cd named GYPSY. It's hungarian music by Werner Muller and his orchest. Thanks. My email sambahe@hotmail.com. Thanks again.
1,can you say cacophony?,"Let me preface this review with the disclaimer that I *almost* know nothing about hungarian gypsy music - BUT I purchased this cd based upon the positive customer reviews found here. Don't believe any of it - this cd completely lacks ANY depth or richness expected of traditional gypsy music - most songs are fully overwhelmed by a single instrument of extremely annoying high-pitched screeching clearly produced by some solo egomaniacal musician not interested in texture but inducing suicidal tendencies in the listener, not unlike being subjected to a full hour of screaming cats in heat in the alley. Luckily you can just throw the cd in your garbage instead of having to hurl garbage at stray cats to shut the gawdawful noise up."
3,Mixed bag,"My grandfather listen to alot of this music as I was growing up and I was hoping this cd would be like revisiting a stay at his house. On some levels it was, the basic sound was there, and some of the songs sounded right but there was not that fevered pitch that I was used to in Hungarian Gypsy Music. Some of the songs sounded totatly different from what I expected, there was one that broke down into this atonal, disjuncted fiddle and horns combo that I had never incountered before.Not what I was expecting and wanting but still brings back fond memories."
3,Good choices of Gypsy Music,Good choices of Hungarian gypsy music. The quality of the orchestra and CD were mediocre at best. A very tinny sound.
5,When You Put Your Mind To It...,"A cargo plane carrying workers accross the Libyan desert is brought down by one of the sand storms that the region is famous for.For the survivors the struggle of life and death will soon make them all aware of the value of human life and the determination of one man who will not take defeat. He is determined to survive and make it home and soon comes up with an amazing idea, that, if he can convince his fellow survivors to help, will get them all home safely.- They can jury-rig a crude areoplane out of the well preserved remains of the cargo plane that has become their unbearable home."
1,Distorted,"The author has a hard time understanding Islam due to her agenda being feminism. That's as much as you there is to it. The book contains one mistake after the other regarding Islam and it is driven not by fact, but by her feelings towards her (probable) poor experience with men in Islam.This book seems reactionary more than educational."
1,Exactly,"Exactly the title for this book ""A feminist Interpretation""If you are a feminist in the real stretch of the word and you want to sell something to make money from that has no value other than to a bunch of other feminists with nothing more to do that try to create a problem where 'normal' women can find none, then it's the book for you.If you are a woman who cherishes her belief in God then this is not the book for you. It does nothing more than question your virtues and love so the so-called feminists can feel better about trying to become like men.This book reeks of belittling another's beliefs in order to get everyone to accept the writers. If there were any truth in these pages, we don't find it anywhere."
4,Good book,It was a good book just don't like how it jumps so fast weeks or months ahead left me wondering what happened in between
5,LOVED IT!,"The author had me hooked from the first chapter. I literally laughed, cried, and had some OH HELL NAW moments while reading this! I didn't want it to end. I happy to know that there are several more parts to this great story!"
4,Good Read,This book was a good read. This book is a page turner. I'm going to be reading to whole series. The Kindle price is good too.
5,The Whole Dollar,"This story to me was real deep my mind went to another level and I simply enjoyed it. In the book Portia and Jay had a love for each other that was genuine and I could feel the chemistry as I was reading, I felt the pain and the joy of it all. McGill writing skill was off the hook she captured their sense of stlye very well it was like I knew them from the hood. I tought I knew what was going to happen at the end just like most books but not this one I mean it was really mind blowing. You got get this book! She only had some 15 cent when she started but ended up with the Whole Dollar."
5,Excellent novel debut,"If it ain't broke don't fix it. Well, somebody needs to tell that to Portia because she definitely had her tools ready. I enjoyed this novel page by page."
4,Pretty good for a non-rolex swiss watch,"You can't beat the price. If you order the watch from Webjeweller.com, it comes from Canada, and at least 100 dollars US less than anywhere else I looked.I had some problems receiving the watch. UPS lost it, but Webjeweller promptly sent out another one. After I got it, it was running too fast. I took it to an authorized service repair center (near me) and they fixed it at no cost. This is the first year of this model (automatic wind) and I expected some problems. It will only get more expensive if you wait. The watch itself is simply beautiful, without being gawdy, and the 3 year warranty is excellent for this class."
4,Interesting....,"Fans of Katatonia's last three records may have some difficulty disgesting this, as there is no clear singing and an abundance of growling. Reminiscent of early Opeth, except slower, more melancholy and less technical. The lyrics are pretty cheesy, but who listens to death metal for the lyrics anyway? Songs are well written, memorable and very doom-laden. Listen before you buy however, its probably not what you're expecting."
4,Lots of ideas to consider,"The do-ahead tips really help when trying to pull of a big party or event while keeping the last minute ""to do"" list as short as possible. There is quite a variety of recipes inside, almost anything you could think of - maybe almost too overwhelming if you don't have anything in mind."
5,Perfect Party Food,"Long my idea of the perfect recipe - make ahead - now amassed in a fabulous collection. But, Ms Phillips goes so much further with guides for every aspect of your party. Honestly, you'll feel empowered just thumbing the pages."
5,Best cookbook ever!!,"My daughter gave me this book several years ago and I thought - ""another cookbook to add to my collection.""Well, I tried a few recipes and was delighted with them. Now it's my go-to cookbook which I use all the time.So I decided to give each of my duaghters and daughters-in-law a copy this Christmas. Hope they like it asmuch as I do for it's make ahead recipes for large numbers. Makes entertaining much easier!!"
5,Perfect Party Food,"I bought this book just before hosting a patio party for over a dozen people, and found it invaluable. I always panic before I host a party; this time my anxiety dipped to quite manageable levels, due to the make-ahead tips. This book is definitely a keeper, since I do love to entertain. The recipes are simple and delicious and broken down into make-ahead pieces."
4,Very helpful,This is my go-to cookbook when I need make-ahead recipes. They are all doable and all can be made at least partially ahead of time. I used it extensively for a lunch for 30 I hosted the day after my son's wedding. I bought a copy for my VERY busy daughter who loves to entertain but has very little time.
2,"Entertaining - but as fiction, not fact","This book is well written and entertaining, but so erroneous it's almost fiction. It would be impossible to note all the historical errors here, but just a few examples: The author tells us the Roman festival of Feralia was celebrated in October (it was celebrated in February); that Pope Gregory added All Souls' Day to the calendar (he died more than 200 years before the first celebration of All Souls' Day); and of course that Samhain was dedicated to the ""Celtic Lord of the Dead"" (the Celts had no such god). The mistakes just go on and on. If you're buying this for decorating tips or sheer fun, it's fine - but if you want real history this isn't the book."
4,Good Source,"I read this book cover to cover and to be honest, I don't think I learned anything new. In fact there is surprisingly little time devoted to actually how/what to eat! It seems like most of the book is devoted to the idea that how you eat during pregnancy will affect your child's health later in life. So if you need motivation to reach for the veggies everyday, this would be a great book to read. But overall it's the same tips about what to avoid, eat from the food pyramid, etc. Having said that, I gave it four stars because even though the information isn't new, it feels good to get it from a reputable source since half the stuff you read, it's hard to tell if you can trust it. Additionally, there are some wonderful, easy, healthy recipes at the end of the book!"
2,Too thick!,"This product is so thick, I can't even get it out of the bottle! Not sure if it's dried up or what's wrong with it, but not usable."
2,Dried Up After A Few Months,"This gesso started out thick, but worked well the first time I used it. A few months later it had dried up to the point of being unusable. I had closed the container and stored it properly, but it still dried up. Would not buy this again."
3,"""Thick"" is an Understatement","Can't say how ""good"" this stuff is for the long term, but using it was difficult. Be prepared with a palette or putty knife and a container to water it down in. You'll need it. A brush won't be enough. I couldn't get the lumps out without a knife. Also, someone tell Amazon that this stuff is not a toy. That is, unless it's meant to be a prank."
2,Not what I expected...,"This is a compilation of Luis Miguel's presentations not really his musical videos for these songs. I was expecting to see them, since in ""LUIS MIGUEL Grandes Exitos(2005)"" DVD they were missing. I am talking about ""Decidete"", ""No me puedes dejar asi"", ""Palabra de Honor"" and others. I have watched these excellent videos some time ago and, let me tell you, they don't have to do anything with these bored presentations of his earlier songs. Hope some day, I will get them for real...P.D. Anyway, 2 or 3 videos of this DVD are worth to watch as ""Me Gustas tal como eres"" which was always presented in a ""live presentation"", not in musical video."
2,Celebridades,"I bought this for my mother, who is loves Luis. I was looking for a current DVD for her. I must say we were a little disappointed that this is a compilation of videos of Luis as a young teenager. Had I known that, I would not have purchased it. He was amazing as a teen, no doubt."
3,beating bug,This game is really addicting I recommend it. This one part I am stuck on. How do you beat the Giant Flea robot thing? I hope someone can answer me.
2,Don't waste your money,"This is a poorly designed game, especially if you are playing with multiple people. My 9 year son really wanted it, but after playing he said it was dumb and switched bakc to another game. Luckily we only rented it."
1,Nicktoons went downhill,"Im not impresed with this game or battle for volcanno Island. The game has the worst graphics ever and Nicktoons just went downhill (espcilly Spongebob). I thought the sequal would be better but it was worse. I really think this game needs someone to work on it and create a better version of the game and stop making these Nicktoon games that comeout every 2 months. Luckily I have a Playstation 3 and a Wii and I have a lot better games for them. I reccomend Sonic The Hedgehog (PS3), Warioware Smothmoves (Wii."
2,Nicktoons ununited,This game is really not that good. I rented it and the chracters do not have there same morals. There powers are incredbiley dumb and the game is way to easy. Luckley I only rented it so I didn't waste the 35$. The other thing that bothers me is that the game barley as any sound except driping noises and backround sounds. Nicktoons should make another game so the chracters arn't so stupid and there is actully a point to the game insteed of runing around being stupid.
5,Great Product- Exactly as Described,"This is one of the classiest bulletin boards I have ever seen. The size is just right for me, and it works equally well with either pushpins or magnets. The little mightie magnets are fantastic with it. The perfect product for getting the small clutter off my desk and having it where I can find it."
3,It's just okay,"I got 2 of these. The product looks cool, and it came with push-pins and strong magnets. However, each one has at least 2 corners that were either dented, pushed-in, or warped. I don't think it's the shipping as the corners were well protected with foam. Too much of a pain to return, that's too bad, I expected more from Umbra."
2,Mediocre Quality,I bought this for my office because I had one of these Umbra boards at home I had bought many years ago. This one is cheaply built and wasn't what I was expecting. The old one has a nice lacquered finish in a deep grey color while this new one has a finish that appears to be from a rattle can.
5,Best find for my needs,This Umbra bulletin board arrived quick and without any issues. I love that it comes with 8 pushpins and 8 magnets. Looks stylish and modern. Would definitely recommend to others seeking a bulletin board.
5,"Perfect bulletin board, best of both worlds","This bulletin board is perfect for the person tired of the typical cork board or for someone who wants the best of both worlds--a board you can use pushpins or magnets with. Would be nice if it came with about 10 more magnetic pushpins and, stylish/modern as the silver finish is, if you could get it in other colors or a stylized pattern. The small magnets are pretty sturdy--I can use one magnet to 'tack' up to several pieces without the magnet falling off or pages. Worth the price, and plan on ordering a few more."
5,Great product for small organizing space,"This board works very well for small organizational needs. It will not replace a large white board, not will it substitute for a large cork board. I have it in my office for the employee phone list, my daily todo, and quick notes. That's all it has room for. My white board covers the heavy note taking."
5,Awesome,"I wanted a place to put all the ""stuff"" we normally put on the refrigerator and this Bulletin Board is perfect! We hung it on the back of the pantry door so it's accessible but we don't see the clutter. We use both the magnets (stronger than they look) & the pushpins. The board is very attractive too - Thank you!"
5,Very moving Scottish folk music,"Andy Stewart of Silly Wizard fame is just incredible on this CD, and Manus Lunny sounds wonderful when he sings in Gaelic (though he doesn't sound quite as good in English!). There are some great songs! Listen to the Fire In The Glen sample. It's one of the best songs on the CD. If you are looking for something a little more down to earth than a lot of ""new age"" Celtic music, then this is for you. These guys sing about the things that still burn in the hearts of their countrymen, like the destruction of their farms and their slaughter in WWI. There is just nothing like it."
5,ALL OF SIZZLA'S SONGS ARE A TRUE INSPERATION,"FROM THE FIRST TIME I HEARD SIZZLA HIS MUSIC JUST TOUCHED MY SOUL. ALL HIS LYRICS ARE ABOUT CONSCIENCENESS AND LIFE AND HE JUST HAS A GREAT WAY OF PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER. I ALSO LIKE THAT HE WRITES ALL OF HIS SONGS SO YOU CAN SEE THAT HE ACTUALLY FEELS THE VIBES OF WHAT HE'S SING ABOUT. JUST LISTENING TO HIM BRIGHTENS MY DAY. SOME OF MY FAVORITES ARE TRUE HEART'S, WHAT DOES IT WORTH AND LOVELY MORNING."
2,"Brilliant artist, garbage albums lately","Wow, Sizzla, kick the ""man"" to the side and go back to your roots. Nothing worse than listening to an album where It's obvious you're reading lyrics off a page and have never rehearsed the music before. Love you man, stop with the JA rewind, rewind, rewind, retardation. Ruined the Reggae on the River experience for thousands."
3,Didn't Come Together,"I waited a long time to read this book, so maybe I just built up too much anticipation, but I was quite disappointed. I admit that I expected more of a traditional ghost story, which this is not, but all expectations aside, the story just didn't seem to follow a clear and cohesive path. I felt a sense of vagueness all throughout the book, and never really felt immersed or completely invested in the characters. I also did not feel there was much of a payoff at the end, as the book did build up suspense and a desire to know what was behind all the mystery. My response to this work is lukewarm at best, but I still might check out some of the author's other works. Maybe it's just this book that doesn't speak to me."
5,Something to Shout About,"I picked this CD not because I had any idea who Kim Criswell isbut because I love the songs. I wasn't prepared for how wonderfulMs Criswell's voice is able to master the incredible and sadlyunder-recorded Irving Berlin songs from ""Call Me Madam."" This CD isa must for those who simply want to hear great songs sung bysomeone who knows great material and has a voice that will leaveyou cheering for more"
3,"Overdone Arrangements, some good vocals","For the variety of Irving Berlin songs this is a great CD, however much of the arrangements are overdone and ruin perfectly wonderful songs. A good example is ""Blue Skies"" the first half of the song is a wonderful Jazz rendition of the classic, but after the interlude for some reason it goes into a full broadway belt number, which just ruins the piece.Kim is a belt legit that is for sure and she can mimic Merman perfectly, which she does in ""Your Just In Love"" perhaps a little too well.Where she knocks it out of the park is Mr. Monotony great tune and done exceptionally well in all aspects.This is a good CD for those who like pure broadway, but if you are expecting a more jazzy soulful sound ala Ella you will be disappointed."
1,"jazz fans, look away","If you are considering buying this album based on Jeff Beal's other more jazz-oriented work, prepare for a huge disappointment. The Gathering is more along the lines of Beal's film score work (Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion, for example), which may be plenty appropriate in that context, but as a stand-alone album, it's just nauseating. This album is full of cheesy production (lots of obnoxious synth pads pretty much drown what little else there is to be heard), quasi-exoticism and new age-y shlock. Not to say this album hasn't got its positive qualities, in fact some of the tunes are okay, and Joan Beal's singing isn't bad; at times her voice achieves a Norma Winstone-esque tone. To be fair, I would likely have given this a two-star rating, if it hadn't already gotten an exuberant five. If, like myself, you enjoyed albums like Alternate Route and Three Graces, don't get your hopes up for this one. If you get off on albums by Enya or John Tesh, there might be something for you here."
1,Not for young kids,I was very disappointed the description and age guideline for this book did not match the contents. I bought this book for a 3.5 year old child and it has NO PICTURES! The stories are short but are not written in language a child would understand.
4,Beautiful performances of fine music,"The Eder Quartet presents these quartets--as well as the others in their Naxos series--with an emphasis on the beauty of the music. While not lacking vigor or drive, they slightly soften the edge that often characterizes performances of Shostakovich's quartets. Both the 4th and 6th quartets have very beautiful slow movements. The slow movement of the 4th reminds me of the adagio of the composer's 5th symphony. The 4th, which is said to be a protest against Nazi treatment of the Jews, features, in addition to the marvelous slow movement, a striking opening, a swirling third and a dance-filled final movement of some intensity. The 6th quartet carries no weighty message, but seems to be simply good music. The 7th is a concise gem. These performances are very attractive, but I would prefer a bit more tension in the 4th quartet. All in all, I'd say that the CD merits the high praise given it by the Penguin reviewer."
5,Some great chamber music,"I liked all 3 string quartets on this album.=Numbers 4, 6 and 7., Number 4 has Jewish themes. The three quartet are all melodic and easy to listen to. The sound was quite good even though the recording was more than 10 years old.."
1,lolz,"Creationism roflcopter up, up, and away! To infinity and beyond! All hail Cthulhu! And his Son, the Flying Spaghetti Monster. And his magical spirit sperm, Russel's Teapot!"
1,This is not science. This is creationism.,"This is same old garbage, creationism, posing as science. If you want your kids to learn modern science, this shouldn't be your choice.If you wonder why creationism isn't science, read about Dover trials:<..>"
1,"Fake junk ""science""","This isn't science, science is based on reality and facts and not made up crap. This sort of junk science does a disservice to real science and scientists."
1,NOT SCIENCE,"ATTN PARENTS: This is not science, this is creationism trying to masquerade as science. Catastrophism was debunked centuries ago, see wikipedia. Do not buy this thinking its ""awesome science"", as it is not. Repeat this is NOT SCIENCE, this is creationism trying to masquerade as science. This was created by the Creation Institute people, they are liars and frauds."
5,Great Black Hair Magazine,"I buy this magazine every month and have been since I was 16, it just now dawned on me to buy a subscription. If you like to look at multiple different hairstyles including those that might be at a hair show you would really like it. For the people that said the hairstyles are not for everyday, its because some of them are meant for an artsy effect. This magazine has multiple celebrity articles also along with a few tips and tricks. One of my favorite bits in this magazine is the fashion police type article in which they give ""tickets"" for horrible hair fashion crimes. They illustrate the people as cartoons and it is very funny. Yes, it has ALOT of ads, but in today's world print isn't really doing well so they have to get their money some how. They are mostly weave ads. In all you can go to wallmart,cvs,walgreens, really any store that sells magazines and try it first. I you like sophisticate's black hair magazine, you will like this."
1,Order not received,I would not recommend this magazine as the it has failed to ship as indicated and provides you with no information for follow up. It is terribly frustrating.
5,Largo,"Largo is a 1994 Naxos recording featuring famous largos by the likes of Handel, Telemann and Bach to mention a few. Naxos has done a great job with the selection and the sound quality is quite stupendous. Cris Possiac has written the music notes. A very fine compilation of famous largos by world famous composers. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
1,"Largo / bought from Zoverstocks as ""used like new"" had several skips",CD bought from Zoverstocks Black & White House is basically unplayable due to many skips. I was very disappointed and will not order from them again.
4,Very Nice Bouncy Seat,"This seat is great. My 5 week old son loves the vibrations and the music, the nature sounds particularly. The only reason why I didn't give it 2 stars is because when you have the vibration on the toys vibrate against the metal part of the chair and it gets quite annoying. Also I don't think the handle on it is sutible for carrying...other than that it's a very nice chair."
3,pleased...for awhile,"I chose to get the ""soothing massage bouncer"" just for that reason, the massage component as well as the vibrations. My daughter didn't seem to enjoy the massage much. She loved the vibrations and the music and sounds really were wonderful to her. But, I began to dislike the un-removable canopy as she got older and wanted to look around more, it really blocked her view from side to side. The positioning of the toys seemed to be akward for baby to look toward or reach. I also didn't care for the pastel type colors and read that after baby began to see color, bright primary colors helped them developmentally. I really liked that the batteries last a long time and the music and other sounds were quite soothing. I ended up buying a Linkadoos bouncer, it was cheap and baby loves the toy bar. She also sees more around her and seems happier in the new bouncer."
5,We love this chair!,"We recieved this bouncer as a shower gift and we are thrilled with it. Our one month old has a problem with acid reflux so we often let him nap in the chair after feedings in order to keep him upright. It has worked wonders. He loves both massage features- but I especially like the vibration massage since it stays on continuously. I thought the rattle was in an odd place at first, but it is directly in his eyeline when I shake it and really seems to enjoy it. The songs and nature sounds are also a great feature."
3,Good for small babies,"We loved this when my daughter was a newborn. It was great because she sat more upright in it than in another bouncer that someone gave us so she could see more of what was going on. She didn't pay much attention to the music but I know others love this feature it just didn't do much for her. It was great because she somtimes needed the vibration as well as being bounced to get her to sleep, at those times it was a life saver. The problem that we had was with the straps. It seems like she outgrew them quickly, by about 4 months. She is in the 90% on the growth charts but it seems like they should have been adjustable or something. At 7 months she could still use the other bouncer. I would never have thought to pay any attention to the adjustability of the straps before this so hope this helps someone else."
3,Dissappointing,"We loved this bouncer when we first got it. It was the only thing my son would sleep in as a newborn. After several weeks, we noticed the bouncer seat was sliding off the tracks. Also, the back massager only worked once in a while. We tried changing the batteries, but is still didn't help. I also, used the handle to carry him from room to room, and the bouncer almost fell apart. Fearing for his saftey we bought him a different bouncer from a different company. I didn't seem safe."
5,A DEFINITE MUST HAVE!!!,"I absolutely love this chair as does my son, Joey. Since day one home from the hospital he has sat in it and loved it! I can put him in it and actually do my housework. This chair goes everywhere we go, grandma's house, aunt's house, everywhere. He loves the vibration and the massager on his back. He can sit in it, fall asleep and be comfortable. Though mine only has two places for toys to attach, it's still amazing. He loved to look at them and now he's 4 months old and able to play with the toys on the sides. I haven't had any problems with the plastic box on the bottom bothering him. I would highly recommend this product to any parent or expecting parent."
4,Wonderful product!,"This is the first item that we bought for our son when I found out I was pregnant, and it was one of the best things we bought him. When things like a swing or rocking him didn't work, the bouncer always seemed to do the trick. He immediately would calm down, and it most cases fall asleep. He doesn't really care for the toys that are on the side of the bouncer though. All in all, it was a great buy!"
4,most secure and comfortable,Nothing beats a massage from a REAL preson...but this is the next best thing. I like that the canapy is permanent and can't be moved. I have had others that just flop around. The sides are nice and high as to keep your babies head from rolling too much. My 2 1/2 year old son has decided that he likes to sit in it as well. If this can withstand his beatings it is very durable. Don't worry about the silly toys that come with all the bouncers out there ..likely that your baby will not even give a hoot about them. Hope this helps.
5,Great for a preemie!,"I tried the linkadoos bouncer first ($15 cheaper) but it wasn't very easy to carry around the house. So I decided to look at other bouncers, saw this one and wondered how I missed it. It's got handles and vibrates, which was all I was looking for. My preemie was on an oscillating ventilator which vibrates their chest so I thought the vibration would be soothing for him when he got home. Turns out he also likes the massager and the different music options. The first day home from the hospital I put him in it and he fell asleep! I'll add my cautionary note to the others - IT'S SO QUIET YOU'LL FORGET THE VIBRATOR OR MASSAGER ARE ON AND RUN OUT OF BATTERIES! I like that it's quiet, but there is that particular drawback."
2,"Loved it, but...","As much as I loved this FP bouncy seat, unfortunately the screws KEPT falling out, within the first week of owning the product! I really wish the construction was better on this product, because it offered the perfect amount of cradling for my baby, unlike the other bouncy seats where the babies can LUNGE fwd., which did happen w/the Kids II bouncy seat. Too bad, I would've replaced the original one in a heartbeat, but I just don't trust the construction."
3,It's an Alright Bouncer But...,"It would be better if it served as an entertainment toy as well. My son had the one with the adjustable bar as a new born he slept in it and when he was older he played with the toys on the bar. Another feature I miss is the retractable umbrella, this one is always covered and it limits the baby's curiosity viewing. it eats up 4D batteries because of the massager and the ok sounds that probably are not necessary. I say stick to the basic models."
1,Dangerous as a carrier,"When my son was four months old, the back of the bouncer flipped foward and he fell face first on the carpet. If you use this as a bouncer that is not carried around, it is fine. Do not recommend carrying baby around in it although it is advertised for that use."
4,Very comfy bouncer!,"My daughter loves the bouncer, especially the vibration feature. At two months, she does not enjoy the massager or the music yet. One of the toys in particular has caught her attention and she also likes to be bounced and sung to sleep in the bouncer. The handle and non-skid feet are great and I always feel that it is very sturdy. The fabric seat is washable and did not shrink at all. The only complaint that I have is that the vibrator seems to have become weaker than it was initially and seems a bit rattly, so I may call Fisher Price. I've only changed the batteries once after a month and a half of frequent use, so I don't think that's too bad. I would definitely recommend this bouncer!"
2,not entertaining enough,My daughter has never liked this seat. I just thought it was because of her age. She is now 3.5 months old and still won't sit in it for more than 10 minutes. She needs toys right in front of her. The toys it came with are too far away and not made for little hands to grab. I wish I could take it back and get the aquarium bouncer. I also didn't like the music. It is way too quiet. I can barely hear the best one...the water.
5,Great Bouncy Seat,"This bouncy seat has worked well for us. I like to snug, enclosed feel that the canopy provides, as well as the 4 locations where toys can be attached. The music modes are pleasant and not too loud. I like the fact that the music turns off automatically after awhile, otherwise I would forget and run through allot of batteries. The vibration mode, however, keeps running until you turn it off and is a great soother when the baby is fussy. One note of caution is that the wire frame legs extend out a bit from the seat itself. This makes the seat very stable, but also makes it easy to hit your toes on it. Or maybe it's just me. All-in-all, we love this bouncy seat."
5,wonderful bouncer!,"I love this bouncer!! It was very easy to put together. It creates such a comfort zone for baby. The pressure on the massager is gentle, and the music and nature sounds are so calming. I like that the bouncer has a handle on the top to make it easy to carry from room to room. Great job Fisher price!!!"
1,not worth the money,I registered for this bouncer because I thought even a baby would love a massage but my baby didn't really like being in it and I wish I would have registered for a bouncer that had the toys sitting in front of it instead of on the sides. I think my baby wouldn't have minded being in it if she had something to look at and play with straight in front of her.
3,"Somewhat soothing, Not at all playful...","My mom was really the one that fell in love with the concept of this bouncer, so she purchased it for my son 2 years ago. He used it forever to sleep in, but never really to play. Now, we're having the same problem with using it for our daughter, who is 9 weeks old. At this age, babies are starting to notice things more, and it would be wonderful if this could keep her amused more. She's really in love with her swing, but when I need to take a shower, I put her in the bouncer, and unless it's a lightening speed shower, there really isn't enough going on with the bouncer to keep her amused. There are 2 toys, monochomatic, which are not only out of reach for babies, but also out of their line of sight. What good is that!?! Also, whenever I run the massage up and down her back, it really kind of freaks her out. But as far as comfort, bouncing and vibrating, it really does serve its purpose."
2,not very useful,"This bouncer was really only useful to me until my daughter was about 2 mo. old. The toy's placement makes it very difficult for her to reach and bat her toys- which frustrates her to the point I don't bother putting her in it any longer. I also had a difficult time lifting her out of it once she got a bit longer- the canopy doesn't fold back, so you have to swing your child out from under it, which can be difficult- especially when they are asleep. This is my first child, and I had planned on keeping her equipment for the next one, but I will definitely be replacing this bouncer."
2,:,"This is the best bouncer/chair out there. I'm a mother of 5. This chair really helps, it cradles my newborn son."

5,Everyday Heroes by Sherry Bennett Warshauer,"This is a great book and everyone should read it. It is heartwarming and if you love dogs or animals in general, you will love this book. The stories in it are short (1-3 pages) and truly inspirational."
2,Must buy additional software to download to PC,"Bought this specifically to be able to download to our computer, but when I received it, we learned that you had to buy additional expensive software to be able to do that. We decided to return it, so we never tried out the functionality of the unit itself, but I was disappointed that the description was not clear about the software."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this item thinking I could track my stats (which is what the product description said it could do). I got the unit and find out that it USED to be able to do this -- if you have a PC running an obsolete version of Windows and you must have a Serial Port!! Plus, if you try to buy the optional package that has the software/cable -- it isn't available. So you have this 'thing' that keeps all this data, but you can't do anything with it. I haven't tried it as just a stroke counter, but that's what it is -- if that works! Save your money."
3,Old Technology,"Very disappointed, attempted go to product web site only to find company is no longer in existance and peripherals and support are not available. Device is complicated, difficult to use and archaic."
1,bad storage i suppose,"i recieved this as a gift for my mother in law who is an avid golfer. i should have checked it more closely. When she tried to use it, it didnt work... no problem we thought, we will just get some new batteries.. no big deal... well, yes, actually - BIG deal since everything on the inside of the machine is corroded and doesnt work with the new batteries either"
1,Beware,"Beware of this product if it is your intention to operate any garage doors other than Genie! I talked to their tech department only to learn that even though it has three buttons, ALL must be programmed to only a Genie product. I have two garage doors, only one is Genie, and live in a gated community with a non Genie gate. So, I still must carry THREE different remotes. Anyone want my GPT90-3?"
4,Yendi,When I ordered this I wasn't sure if this was the same perfume. So I ordered a small or mini Yendi just to make sure it was the correct perfume for a gift. Turned out that it was. So I will be back to order the larger bottle of perfume to make up for the small one i gave
4,Builds,"This is a very good disc that just got pegged as unremarkable because there are so many jazz releases . I'd first heard (pianist) Andy Laverne on his LIGUID SILVER recording for DMP ? i think it was (many years ago now) . I own that disc and love it . When i was looking for reasonably priced authentic jazz cd's i saw this one . I wanted to see what Andy and his quartet sounded like circa 1997 . You know this is an above average disc just by the folks involved ; Al Foster (drums) , George Mraz (bass) and Randy Brecker (trumpet and flugelhorn) . The time fill is very generous . 1. when you wish upon a star 8:25 , 2. Summertime 4:47 , 3. maiden voyage 8:17 , 4. someday my prince will come 7:29 , 5. song for my father 6:37 , 6. all blues 7:37 , 7. mr. syms 7:55 , 8. cantaloupe island , 7:21 , 9. round midnight 4.25 and 10. on green dolphin street 6:41 . The song selections are great and the playing is often wonderful . A good buy ."
2,Obsolete book,"Part 1 (6 chapters) - Absolutely a waste of time, not worth a read. And the code examples are not related to JWSDP.Part 2 (6 chapters) - Discusses on SOAP, UDDI and WSDL. The code discusses using a Older version of Apache SOAP and Apache Axis. The code needs a complete rewrite.Part 3 - Discusses on JAXP, JAXB, JAXR, JAXM and JAXRPC. Good introductions but the JAXB chapter is based on DTD (which is obsoleted in the latest specs). JAXM and JAXRPC chapters just reproduces the Sun JWSDP tutorial...not much value addition.Part 4 - Security, WSFL, WSIF (based on IBM Specs) currently these specs are obsolete no further releases.It might've been a good book during 2002. The code and content needs an update to the latest specs and SOAP implementations."
1,This is a major FAIL!,"I attached this to my router and first noticed that it was in the way of my fixture. It sits really low. But worst is, it didn't work well at all. Most of the debris was left on the work piece. And I had it hooked directly to a 5HP shop vac! It also makes it very difficult to change bits as you can't lay the router down on its side."
5,Brilliant whistle playing,Mary Bergin is one of the best whistle players of all times. This CD is a classic and it's a must have for all those who like Irish traditional music.
5,Fun interactive toy,Both my 6 and 7 year olds love these Tamagotchi toys. They enjoy having them connect and interact and I enjoy that it teaches them some responsibility for a future pet! :)
5,Home Depot In N Miami is Crazy!,"Home Depot In N Miami is Crazy! This product is amazing. I've used it to glue art glass on two countertops and it performed better than grout and a host of other ""most powerful"" adhesives out in the market. I wish I could find it locally again. Also, if anyone reading this review needs a household adhesive, you will be disappointed by anything else. Find it! Buy it!!!"
4,"Very good book, clear, concise and realistic!","This is a one those books I would recommend to any MBA student. I am sure the benefit derived from it will greatly complement the technical skill learned in the classroom.Unfortunately many organizations are pathologically political and one must learn how to survive, but also how to win in an environment polluted with political sharks.I highly recommend it."
3,It's okay,"The colors are nice, the depth is good, but with today's tortilla sizes, this warmer is barely able to cut it. We mostly buy ""Mission"" burrito sized tortillas and it is a snug fit to get them into the dish with the lid on. If it were only an inch bigger, it would be perfect."
5,Great tortilla warmer,This is a great size. We use 8 inch tortillas and the terra cotta ones I found were not big enough. It is pretty too!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This tortilla warmer says it's for 10 inch tortillas, but 10 INCH TORTILLAS DO NOT FIT IN IT!! I had to return it and pay to ship it back. I was very unsatisfied."
3,"Valuable concept, dated presentation","The original copyright on this book is 1982. The writing style is even older and highly academic, making it difficult to extract much of the wisdom the book has to impart.I appreciated the book's insistence that accenting the downbeat tends to produce non-musical playing, and I learned from his discussion of the musical importance of the ""arsis"" within the thesis-arsis construction of any phrase. But it seems to me that, beyond these contributions, the note-grouping method is subject to a basic problem. It is billed in the book's subtitle as ""A Method for Achieving Expression and Style in Musical Performance,"" yet unless you already possess a basic intuition for expression and style in musical performance, it is not clear how you will know what grouping of the notes is called for."
4,Useful foundation to an approach to phrasing.,"This may be an interesting read for a musician who is looking for some concepts to improve their phrasing. It is a pretty dry and objective approach that deals mostly with how to create movement in phrasing by grouping upbeat notes(arsis) to the downbeats (thesis). I don't think this approach will have all the answers in all cases, but it is an important foundation. Will help to lead the student toward a more intelligent reading of the music."
3,Female martial art actress of near-recent times,"This movie is from the mid-1990's and unknown to me, so bought the recently released DVD out of curiosity, pretty sure it would be enjoyable. Though it wasn't that outstanding a film frankly, still enjoyed it because the agile Maria Ford stars in it. I'd not seen her before. She knocked me for six dishing it out to the bad guys drilling plenty with lead (if she ain't karate-chopping them - at one stage near-naked - great stuff!). Her well-executed action scenes alone made it worth watching, and there are quite a few. She looks great in a policewoman-type blue shirt too. (UK customer)."
5,Best jig saw you will ever own,"Bosch is the standard by which all other jig saw makers judge themselves. This in itself pretty much says it all. Once you use this tool, you will understand what that means.I prefer the barrel grip b/c it is easier for me to control. However, the handle model has all the same features, just a different grip configuration, so the choice is purely a personal one.This saw cuts through almost anything like butter. There is very little vibration. These features pair up to make your control over the tool excellent, and that is what you get a jig saw for!Changing blades is quick and easy. Changing the base angle is a snap.If you are looking for a jig saw you are going to have for a long time, then this is the tool to get."
2,As good as it gets,"I have used portable jigsaws and sabersaws for most of my forty years as a general contractor. Last year my Bosch barrel handled jig saw of some 15 years service was stolen, along with $1500 worth of other tools, from my truck toolbox. I tried other jigsaws and also the Bosch D handle jigsaw but was very dissapointed with their performances. I was reluctant to spend the extra money on another Bosch barrel handled jigsaw at first, but I am very happy to have popped the extra few dollars for the control the Bosch jigsaw gives me. In addition, the tool-less blade change that was missing on my old Bosch jigsaw makes the purchase of the new one even more satisfying.Kudos to Bosch on a great tool for anyone who is using a jigsaw for any task requiring the extra control the barrel handle gives the user."
2,best one made,I have one of these saws i bought it in 1982 and the olny thing i have repaired on it was put a new cord on it and i use it almost every day on the consturtion site
2,"Made in China, should be $10","Where is the savings? Pay a premium for an item made in China at a huge discount. That sounds like a good deal (no jobs left and no savings - sign me up for that program). I will return this ""discounted"" item asap; or better yet, use it as a hammer.My quest begins for tools made in this country - such as Milwaukee orbital sawzall: good price, excellent tool, would have paid much more. I do not care if a tool(made here) costs three times as much as one made in China and I have to spend three weeks locating it! Tell that to your economics professor."
5,Easy because of balance,"Feels like a dream in your hand, cuts like a champ..If you can spend a little extra buy this saw, it's well worth it for the handling.."
5,My Favorite Power Tool!,"Bought the Bosch 1584AVSK from Amazon, mostly based on reviews seen here. I must agree with all the very positive comments on it here--this is not like those junky old Craftsman and Skil saws all of us remember from the old days! Like everyone says, the barrel grip really gives you fine control, and there is plenty of power with very low vibration. NOTE: I recently discovered that to get the neatest and most accurate cuts when cutting 3/4"" materials and larger, make sure to use the Bosch PROGRESSOR T234X3 blades--these are longer and thicker than regular blades, and they virtually eliminate any waviness in your cuts. If you are careful and use a fence, you can get rip cuts with the Bosch and this blade on plywood and MDF that match those of a circular saw and fence. This is a very sweet tool, and has now become my go-to tool for most projects. Highly recommended!"
5,"If you need to read this book, I'm so sorry","Oh my! This is ABSOLUTELY the most comforting book I have ever read. My ""forever dog"", Molson, died of leukemia, and we read this book together on a daily basis until I had the strength to release him. No books, no websites; no friends, no other could have helped us transition more then this book. I now keep at least three copies available at home to give to others who experience the absolute, inconsolable loss of a dear friend and companion. Like everything, it can't obliterate the hurt, but it can SURELY raise the hope. BRAVO! and Thank You!"
5,A wonderful gift for a friend grieving the loss of a pet.,"My veterinarian sent me this book after the loss of my beloved Deerhound, Isolt, to lymphoma. It made me cry and still does a year and a half later. Nevertheless, it's a good cry because it's a reminder that my lovely girl will always be with me."
5,For Every Dog An Angel,"If you have someone who has lost a dog, this book is just the right book to send those who have lost their dog. If you read it first you may have to keep a Kleenex box nearby. This is a beautiful story and is a book you or they will keep forever."
5,Validated my feelings,"We had to put our beloved Bassett Hound of 12 years to sleep. My two children, especially my 8 year old, had a hard time processing it. Someone recommended this book, along with Dog Heaven as a resource. Although this book is fine for children, I took great comfort in the way it spoke to me. That my ""forever friend"" is happy and her ""angel"" helped her to cross over and that she would want us to eventually share our love with another dog, that it would make her happy. When your pet dies, the grief is real, and this validated my feelings and helped me (and my children) process it."
5,For Every Dog an Angel,"My 2 grandsons, ages 5 and 3, lost 2 dogs in the same year and this book was very helpful. It was also helpful to my dog loving adult daughter. A sad time for all."
3,more for a child than an adult,"I was looking for more of an adult book but it was a quick and easy read. If you have a child who is dealing with the death of a pet, this would be a nice and comforting book for them."
5,For anyone who has loved a dog,For anyone who has loved a dog and lost that dog. This is a heart felt book to help ease the loss when you lose your pet. Great for kids too!
5,For Animal Lovers,This is a charming book which explains the sweet relationship that enriches the lives of people who are pet owners. It also can ease the pain when the relations ends in death.
4,A Book for every person owned by a dog.,This book is for every person who has ever been owned by a dog and had to say goodbye. It is a book for those of us who have lost dogs and those who have dogs. It is a wonderful book to help children as well as adults with bereavement over a lost pet. A book that gives you hope.
3,Cats love these toys,"I purchased a pack of these wool cat toys as my cats loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee them. Within a day, two of them were destroyed and my cats are not ""destroyers"" normally. Think that they are not sewn real tight, but the cats love them and they are very affordable."
4,"""Azalia"", An unexpected Arturo de Cordova's love in a wild selvatic place...","This interesting film was shoted in 1947. The same year, that Arturo de Cordova filmed another monster production called: ""La Diosa Arrodillada"" with Maria Felix. The reason for what I'm reminding this film it's because against ""La Diosa..."", ""Algo Flota Sobre el Agua"" shows the kind of films where Arturo always interpreted the starring rolls between wild selvatic landscapes: Veracruz is the scenary in this picture, where Manuel (Arturo de Cordova) married with Carmina; fell in love with a precious young girl called ""Azalia"" (Elsa Aguirre), who intented suicide in the river near Manuel's house... The play roll shows the regular problems and circumstances of a group of fishers that tried to make an independent living without the rules of the owner. The film has an approximated running time of 120 minutes. Maybe too long for that decade... Good Luck!"
2,Mixed Bag,"It's okay if you're only going to use it once or twice. The downside is that the cap turned rusty and fell off, breaking the chain...."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,I bought this album before amazon was a company and I still find it to be one of the best acoustic guitar albums I have. Such wizardlike mastery of the wooden instrument he has. Progressive jazz in a real organic matrix. Must have!!!!!
2,not worth the money,"Some things about this product I really like. I like that I can work on it at home with my kids (11 and 14) and they can use it independently for fairly long stretches.However, there are more things I don't like:-Two of the CD ROMS are not Mac OS X compatible, even though the product description specifically said it was.-There are errors in the French, especially the written.-The workbook and CDs do not work together as seamlessly as we would like. It feels like we're always piecing things together ourselves.Thankfully I am fluent in French and able both to correct the errors and help coordinate the CDs and workbook, but I would definitely not recommend this product for someone with no French experience who was trying to learn on their own."
1,Language Lab French CD,"Not pleased as I prefer the English word spoken first....then the French version. This has the French word spoken first, then the English."
3,The ending will blow you away,"This was really an interesting and intense story of illicit love during the turn of the century in China. The camera work and colors were spellbinding. As with most chinese films with english subtitles, you must view it at least 2-3 times to really appreciate it. I guess I really liked this film because not only did it seem historically accurate but also the characters were really believable. The fireworks competition at the end was as suspenseful as a gunfight. And the ending is not your everyday hollywood sugar coated junk."
2,Confusion reigns..,"The best aspect of this movie is the location and the scenery. Beautiful filming but a plot with too many blanks and questions. I won't give away the ending but it was stupid and by that time I didn't care what happened to the hero. I usually love Chinese dramas but this one missed with its plot of unrequited love being dragged out too long, and not making much sense."
1,red firecracker shows red hot passion,"I loved this movie even the third time, my wife found it too intense and realistic and refuses to see it again for it haunts her. This is not your typical Hollywood fluff film but an insiteful look at China of the past (and maybe still today). Marrying below your station was almost as ilicit as un-wed love. The consequences of both can be very harsh. If you like a movie where you never stop to say ""it's just a movie"" this historically immaculate, painfully touching and often amusing tale is for you. DPG"
3,Comfortable but ...,"This seat is a very comfortable seat for babies, especially newborns. It does provide another place for them to sleep. The only downfall is once they start to move (like kick their legs) this seat is stationary and does not move like a bouncer. Carter's makes a seat with the same comforts as this papasan but also bounces and I would recommend it over this one."
3,Not all that great+baby had trouble sitting comfortably,"My baby never fit well into this seat. She weighed 7lbs at birth and is now 11 lbs and she seems to slide down the seat (if not strapped in she'd slide right out of the chair). Also, the vibrations don't seem to be enought to sooth her. If the seat also had the bouncing ability that most bouncers have, she would have liked this a lot more."
4,Great for newborns!,I received this item as a shower gift. I really enjoyed using the Papasan when my little guy was a newborn. I later moved him into a bouncy seat. The Papasan worked wonderfully with the padding to help hold the baby. There is no way a newborn can be in a bouncy seat without falling over. The Papsan worked wonders when I needed to shower or cook dinner. I would recommend this item. My guy did outgrow it at about 2 1/2 months but I am still glad I had this item.
5,Totally Awesome!!!,"This was somewhat of an indulgent purchase for me for our second child but what an awesome item. Our baby from the moment we took him home has absolutely loved this papasan. He has eaten, slept in and just about anything else in it! It is so soft and snugly and supports your baby's body and head beautifully. Also, it folds up so easily for travel. I would recommend this to everyone who is about to have a baby. You'll love this item!"
3,Baby Papisan,"I used this item when first bringing my newborn home from the hospital. She weighed 7lbs 6oz and was 20 inches long.I used the Papasan every day for a month. The baby slept in it comfortably and the vibration option on the Papisan was a big hit, until it stopped functioning 2 weeks later. (Yes, the batteries were changed).After four weeks my infant outgrew the Papisan. She would slide down even after being harnessed and her legs outgrew the length of the seat, often causing the blanket to fall off her.I think this product was a waste of money considering the usage of the item was not long."
3,Needs more bells and whistles,"I bought this item for my newborn because he didn't like sleeping in his bassinet. He liked it at first, but now at 3 weeks old doesn't like to stay in it for a long time when he is awake. He sometimes uses it to sleep in, which is good. This needs something else to attract a baby's attention because it doesn't bounce and has nothing for the baby to see. I am returning it and looking for something else."
1,Horrible Support,This papasan has the worst support for babies. When you put the baby in the papasan it sinks down and makes the baby's head go down to their chest. I had to put another pillow underneath her butt just so her head wouldn't hang. The fabric is great and soft just not enough support. Also where the head goes you cannot adjust the height. So my baby's head sat down alot lower then where it was suppost to go.
2,No Bounce,"My baby did not like this, you are not able to bounce this manually . All it does is vibrate and that is not enough sometimes for the newborn who enjoys bouncing movements."
3,Nice if you have the money to be extravagant!,"This was given to me as a gift when my baby was about 6 weeks old. This is nice for sleeping or just sitting I used when taking a shower in the first couple of months. But it doesn't have toys w/it at all and really no place to clip them. So by the time my guy was 4 months it was not much help anymore. The music and vibrating were nice but weren't any big help for us. I think it would be better to have one w/ a toy bar. And the cover thing just got kicked off too. I think you could buy something else for the same price that would last longer. It is probably more attractive to you, but not to baby =)! Oh I agree w/other baby slides down easily if not buckled and buckling is not that easy. And can't use it once they are sitting up. Spend your money on something else!"
5,Okay I LOVE THIS,"My six month old son loves this. When he was born he'd just snuggle up in it. I have a freind who's baby girl had reflux and she slept in this for the first couple months (at least), instead of her hard, uncomfortable carseat.My baby won't sit in anything too long now, but he loves to snuggle up in this before his nap.I am not a kid. Amazon requires a credit card to give reviews."
2,a little over rated!!!,"I,like most parents,went by the look of this seat. I recieved this as a gift when my son was almost 2 months old, he was a big baby weighing 9 lbs. 6 oz. when he was born, so therfore this seat did not last long at all. The pillow, which is not removeable, was in the wrong place, it made my son's head lean forward. After all was said and done my son enjoyed the simple bouncy seat with the fish and lights. I guess if you have a very small infant, and you use it right away, you MAY get your monies worth. My son out grew it before he was 3 months old and he was 2 months when I got it."
1,Cute but not practical,"I registered for this product because it looked comfy and wasn't as tacky as the other bright-colored, busy bouncers. This is a stationary seat, so there's no bouncing--but it does vibrate. There are no lights of course and nothing for your baby to look at---so it's pretty boring. I thought it would be great for a new born, but it was more work to put him in it b/c I had to entertain him even when I put him down. I put him in his cousin's bouncy seat (Kick and Play) and he loved it. We now have a real bouncy seat, with toys and lights---and I wish I had gotten that to begin with b/c now he's getting too big for it but he likes it. As for the papasan, it holds blankets or sits in our trunk just to use in emergencies when we are some where and I need a place to put the baby. Go with the tacky, wild colored bouncers that won't match your home decor but will definitely entertain and stimulate your little one."
1,Looks are all it's got,"This chair was awful, the nice cooshy pillow on top was not in the right spot and you can't remove it or even move it out of the way. It made my son snore when he was breathing because it pushed his chin to his chest. To tell you the truth I brought it to my sister in law's house and he used it maybe a handfull of times then I left it there. He liked the 15 dollar kids II chair we got for my parents house better. I loved the looks of this too but it is really for bigger babies I think and by the time they fit comfortably they would be too old."
3,odd restraint system,"while the seat itself is very attractive i found the belt system to be really weird. the crotch part is nice and wide but super long and elastic which allowed my wiggly son to slide down so far that his ankles were hanging off the edge. i suppose its designed for chubbier babies than my own. on the up side, the vibration and music combo was a big hit me. it folds completely flat and doesnt turn itself off for nearly 20 minutes."
5,Please Let Me Sleep,This was the only thing my daughter would sleep in for the first month and a half of her life. We had tried every thing. After way to many sleepless nights I thought I was going to go out of my mind and I put her in turn the music on and she was out and slept for four hours. It was great!!!!!
2,"Comfy, not for active babies","The Baby Papasan seat seems to be a very comfortable seat for small babies, but once the babies get beyond the newborn stage, they seem to be too long for it. It is also a very calm seat, nothing to entertain the baby. My daughter only used hers a few times, was very bored with it. The music is very loud, I put tape over the speaker."
3,Doesn't Bounce- not adjustable either...,"This is a good chair for baby when he/she is older but not great for newborns. It is too big and they slide down in the seat too easily. The chair angle is not adjustable either so you are stuck with the angle it comes at. The head rest is not adjustable either so when baby slips down in the seat, the head rest is above his or her head. The vibration feature is good but it quits too soon, and you have to restart it. The music is nice. The cushion is good in this chair but it doesn't bounce at all- just vibrates and needs to be more adjustable so that babies can use it from birth on. Is a nice sturdy chair but not good enough for the money. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,CUTE BUT NOT GREAT,"This is very pretty but very plain, comfy for the small infant but once they get a few months old...It's boring! The music & vibration only amuse a 4 month old for so long. I did purchase the matching swing - I love that! My baby slept in that until almost 3 months old. I just bought a bright colored bouncy seat & my baby girl loves it. She stares at the colors & loves to bounce."
2,I returned it,"I registered for this because I liked the comfy fabric and everyone said you need a bouncy seat. Unfortunately, the seat is too upright and the vibrations were so mild that it did nothing for my baby. I am much happier with the ducky cradle swing!"
2,Not worth the money,"I, like most everyone else, registered for this seat because it is nice looking and seemed like it would be exceptionally comfortable. My baby is now 5 months old and practically hangs in the harness. He also has ocassionally had these mysterious scratches on his left arm and we finally just figured out where they were coming from....the velcro strap on the seat that holds the little toy! There are sharp corners and edges on the very small velcro fastener. I will be taking mine back to the store tomorrow!!"
2,Very disappointed,"I had recieved this seat as a gift, but I had requested it. I have been very disappointed in it. My son didn't like it from the moment we brought him home from the hospital. I feel terrible that we can't get any use of it. It sits up to straight. Doesn't move. My son cries when I put him in it. It looks very comfortable. But apparently it is not for him. I am trying to put it to use to not feel bad that I requested it. But my son's happiness is more important."
2,"Great for about two weeks, then...","Babies grow fast...so your baby will probably just grow right out of this Papasan just as fast...it's great for newborns because they really can't focus much on anything, but quickly after a few weeks, you will start noticing that your baby will just grow bored right out of their mind! Unless you have a play gym or some toys dangling within your baby's site, this chair will soon be collecting dust. I admit, it was a great idea and it's cute! But like many parents out there, I got all caught up in the excitement of all these new (and expensive) products, I failed to realize that this papasan would soon be outgrown! Our Papasan is folded up standing right next to our playard in hopes that it will be used again, but our Ocean Wonders aquarium has now taken it's place...if you have money to burn, this would be a good buy, otherwise, save your money and get a bouncer suitable for newborns."
4,I love the chair!,"This chair was WONDERFUL when our baby was a newborn, it was about the only place he'd sleep! But by the time he was 2 months old and looking to explore things, he became bored quickly. We added a toy bar and he was okay, but prefers the bouncer chair now. It's perfect for newborns to sleep cozily. I recommend this for all moms!!! We have bought 3 people these as gifts and all 3 also love the chair. The bouncers sit the babies too upright and this has just been perfect! Our chair has also gotten a lot of use, we have borrowed it to my sister-in-law and after that one of our friends is going to use it!!!"
3,Good for the first 3 months!,"The Baby Papsan was very nice to have for about the first 3 months for our little girl. Unfortunately, she likes to sit up and after the 3rd month it became apparent that she didn't care to be laying back so far. It will make a good ""hand me down"" for a friend or family member, but not sure I would have spent so much on it had I known she would outgrow it so quickly."
3,COMFY,"My daughter is just beginning to like this chair, she didn't like it when she was a newborn. I wish the music/vibration stayed on a longer timer, or had a feature to leave it on/ and the chair has steep reclining so she slides off the bottom sometimes."
5,Great item!!!,I bought this item for my newborn and she loves it!! Im glad i bought it.whenever she gets fussy i put her in it and she falls right to sleep with the music and vibrations.
2,not very exciting,"We received this as a shower gift along with the swing that goes with this. I thought my daughter would love it, but she seems very bored in it. I am going to have to get another bouncy seat. It doesn't really do much."
4,Try Target,"I have registered for this product, based on reviews and comments from parents with infants. For the person that hasn't been able to find it at Toys 'r Us or Babies 'r Us...try Target. We found it at the one in Dallas and College Station."
3,Bella thinks it is boring!,"We bought this thinking it was soft and cozy, but it can't bounce up and down and it shuts off after 15 minutes and sometimes Bella wakes up when it stops vibrating. Not a good thing for a baby with colic spells! Cute but too boring and the auto shut off is a drag!"
1,Not used very long.,"I initially purchased this based upon the reviews. It felt soft and comfortable; who wouldn't want to sleep in this! My princess used it a handful of times. It now takes up space in her closed, and she is only a few months old. I am debating on whether or not to even save it for our next baby. Personally, I would save the money and buy an extra swing for Grandma's house (or the office)."
2,I wish my baby liked it...,"This was my favorite thing on my registry...I was so excited that we received it as a present. My baby doesnt like it. We can only get her in it when we are standing in front of her entertaining her. Even when she was newborn she didnt appreciate it. I tried over and over...I finally bought her a Kick and Play by Fisher Price and she LOVES IT!!! I think the Papasan just bored her and the music is way too loud!I gave it a ""**"" because I think some babies might like it...it just doesnt have much staying power once they are out of the sleeps all the time phase!"
2,Not worth the money!!!,"The only good thing that I can say about the Papasan is that it is cozy, and sturdy. My 2 year old likes to climb in it, but the baby ( 2 Months) hates it. It is boring. No toys to look at, the vibration turns off too soon and is very minimal, and the music is loud and you can't turn it down! Don't waste your money. I thought that it looked so comfy, and it is, but that is it!!!!! Get something with toys to look at, and a volume control!"
4,outgrow quickly,"I loved this bouncer for the first 2 months but now that my daughter is 23"" long her feet hit the battery pack. Im afraid that it will hurt her heels because she kicks it, and the padding doesn't cover it adequately.The vibration didn't do anything for her either, she was just as happy with it off as she was with it on."
4,Good stuff,"My little baby spends a lot of time sleeping in the family room in her Papasan. I didn't put her in it until she was about three weeks old, but it put her right to sleep. She despised it for the next several days, and now (at 5 1/2 weeks) she seems to love it. It is nice that you can pick it up with the baby in it and get a shower for yourself!It is also easy to give her a bottle in it.I gave it 4 stars because what works for my baby, may not be for everyone and I read and consider these reviews before I buy. I will say that ours was a gift and came from another store, and it was $5 more there than here on amazon.comHope it helps :) Best of luck to all the new Moms!!!"
2,OK seat for maybe the 1st month,"Like an idiot, i registered for this because i liked the way it looked and i was getting the matching swing (which is great by the way). Iwish I had talked to other moms and chosen a good bouncer... first off, it does not even bounce! It is stationary and has nothing stimulating about it. The head cushion props the baby up in an uncomfortable position and as soon as my daughter started to grow, she could not stand the seat for 2 seconds. It is virtually impossibe to travel with because it does not compact and is oddly shaped. I ended up just getting the Ocean Wonders Bouncer, which is fun and relaxing for my daughter and I haven't touched the Papasan since she was 1 month old. To sum it up: Ebay."
5,Perfect for when they're first born,"I saw this seat in a pregnancy magazine and decided to get one and I'm really glad I did. This is the perfect seat for a newborn and a new mom. My son did not like to be in his infant car seat and this was a great alternative. He slept comfortably in it during the day and I was able to take him from room to room with me so I could keep an eye on him. It folds up simply and made many trips to grandma's house. The fabric seat comes off easily and washes up very nicely. My son was nearly 9 lbs. and over 21 inches long when he was born and fit in it perfectly. At 10 weeks he's over 14 lbs. and 24 inches and still enjoys naps in it. However, now he does prefer his swing more. But I am extremely happy with this seat and would recommend it to any new mom who wanted to keep her baby close."
2,Wish baby liked it better!,I would actually give this fewer stars because we've gotten NO use out of it... but I think it's one of those personal preference things. My son just doesn't like it. We really thought he would - it's so soft and snugly. Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer. He LOVES it. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down.
2,"Decor friendly, but small and boring","I loved the neutral colors since it was going to sit in our living room. And the music was pleasant to listen to. Unfortunately, it didn't recline enough to support our newborn and now, at 2 and 1/2 months of age, the chair is too small for his average-sized body. Even when we managed to prop him up in it, there was nothing to keep his attention (which was something I didn't think would be an issue at this early age). I gave up and bought the Kick 'n Play Bouncer, which not only fits him better, but keeps him entertained enough to forget about his colic spells!"
4,Great for reflux!,My daughter was diagnosed with reflux when she was 10 days old. We have had her sleeping in this ever since (she is now almost 5 months). It has been wonderful for us!
4,Baby Papasan,"This is a great vibrating chair to use in the beginning, it supports and ""cozy's"" your newborn, we found that we did not use it as much when our son started watching toys & lights as it does not have any activities. It flattens out so great for putting on the side of the crib or underneath."
3,Great seat for newborns...,"My son loved this seat as a newborn. It was comfy and warm for him. But once he turned 6 weeks, he wanted more stimulation, so I bought him the Ocean Wonders bouncer. The only downfall besides not being able to use it long is the music and vibration are on a timer. Once it would shut off, my son would wake up and I'd have to reset it. It was great while it lasted."
4,Does this chair come in adult size?,"At first my newborn did not care for the Papasan. From the start we was too long, however, he was not the average newborn. He weighed 10lbs 5.1 oz at birth and was 22.5 in. long. He didn't like his legs hanging off the edge or the blanket that came with it. He is now 3 months old and the papasan is the most valuable accessory (besides his swing) It works great for feeding, relaxation and watching the Wiggles! I only wish it had more interactive toys, that he could kick and play with. Oh yah do they make this chair in adult size?"
2,"Great Product -- Too Bad It's for Dolls, not actual children","My husband and I bought this product for our son (our second large child). This is a wonderful product, however, I wish that the manufacturer would make it more likely to hold the ""average"" size child. We loved everything about this product -- except the size. Our son at 23"" and 14 lbs. at 10 wks. barely fits into this bouncer seat. We also discovered that the vibration will shut itself off which is great to have as an option but a pain when you have to continually restart it.I recommend this product for premies only. For average sized or larger infants, you're wasting your money because you'll be out buying a new bouncer in a few weeks.Note to Fischer-Price: MAKE IT BIGGER AND YOU'LL HAVE A HOME RUN ON THIS ONE! :)"
3,I call it the Wedgie Seat!,"This chair is cute and really comfy looking. It gives my baby a place to sit and hang out without being flat on the floor or propped up with pillows.The music is really nice too. It is not like the music you find on other baby items (you know, the ones that sound like an ice cream truck) it actually sounds like real music.However, no matter how tight she is strapped in or how close to the top I put her, she wiggles down and looks like shes getting a big old wedgie! I think if she wasn't strapped in she would slide right out! It is actually kind of funny. It doesn't seem to bother her but it just doesn't look right.Also, it would be nice if there was a toy bar or something--the chair is a little on the boring side.I use it--but would get more use if Baby's booty would stay put!"
3,Boring,It looks really comfortable and relaxing but it just doesn't seem to stimulate my baby boy. He gets bored really fast. But-the music it plays is great...I'd recommend getting the papsan swing.....stimulating and relaxing!
3,Just okay,"This papason was my choice since the colors were neutral and would coordiante with my house decor (I'm a first time Mom). Now I know better... I need something with bright colors, lights, and toys. My 2 month old doesn't show any interest, well, there isn't anything to show interest in. It's a vibrating chair... there isn't anything in front of her to catch her eye. Also, she's now 22 inches long, which is too long for the seat. If she kicks her legs, they hit the metal frame that supports the seat."
4,Awsome nap time spot,"Our little one is 6 weeks old. I was so excited to get this at his baby shower. I had him in it the first day he came home from the hospital and he loves it for naps. We have 2 other seats and he won't sleep in them at all wakes up as soon as we put him in them, but this one he sleeps for hours in because it forms to him and he thinks he is being held still. I also like it because after 15 min the motion stops and that saves batteries. So far it is the best thing we got at our shower we use it everyday when he naps and is awake."
2,Not Worth the Money,I was so excited to buy this seat for my daughter - but every time we have tried to use it she gets very upset. She cries the entire time she is in the chair.. Some of the downsides are that it only vibrates and the music function is very loud and can not be adjusted. Also it appears to be super comfy but when you put it together you realize th fabric where the baby sits does not have much give. Overall - I would recommend looking at other bouncers that have more functions to them. We will be returning this one!
4,I love it but make sure you have some patience,"I got this as a baby shower gift and even though the baby hasn't gotten here yet I can tell you how soft and wonderful it is. HOWEVER, please make sure you have some patience when assembling it. It was fairly easy but the screws to attach the frame kept falling out and the plush seat was hard to get around the attached music/vibrations box. It took us about 20 minutes to assemble. Otherwise, highly recommend it and my friends with new babies really like it."
4,pretty cool,"Note that the vibrate feature has an automatic timer that times out after a short while. My son has woken up because it stopped vibrating (I wish they had a choice to keep it running, instead of it shutting off). He loves to sleep in it, and I highly recommend it."
1,Cute only goes so far.,"I absolutely fell in love with the Baby Papasan before my son was born. I had to have one because I thought it was soooooo cute. Well, cute only goes so far. I put my son in this seat the day he came home from the hospital and he slept so peacefully in it. After that he used it for about 2 or 3 weeks and that was the end of that. It doesn't bounce like most bouncey seats so he just sits in it for about 10 minutes vibrating and listening to the music, just as he's about to fall asleep the automatic timer cuts it off and he wakes up. The moment has passed and he just wants out of it. If this seat just bounced he would love it. He is like 50% of all babies and likes movement. If your baby is one of these DO NOT buy this product...it will just be a decoration next to your couch."
1,Too Boring!,"I bought the baby papasan because it had nice neutral colors and felt really soft, but I was very disappointed with it. My baby only used it for 2 weeks. He napped in it, but newborns can really nap almost anywhere. We even had to prop it up with a pillow to keep him from slipping down. After the first 2 weeks, he would scream every time we tried to put him in it. It's just too boring. It doesn't bounce, and there's nothing to look at or touch. I ended up getting rid of it because it was just taking up valuable space in the house."
5,Much Better Then I Thought,"I had my baby on 9-3, he was small 6lbs 3 oz when i regestired for my shower i didnt get this because i THOUGHT it would be a waste being that he'd only use it for what i thought would be just a few weeks. well, after the 3rd night home i RAN to babies r us to get it & i LOVEEEE IT. he fits in it perfectly, the music is very soothing, the vibration is very soft. he has been in it since that day. i even use it to sleep him at night & then once he is asleep i put him in his bassinet. so far out of all the things he has gotten this one is with out a doubt my favorite. the materials are super soft & putiing it away is a cinch. the back legs fold & it becomes flat so it fits in a closet or behind any furniture. i think my baby will be in it for a while. i DEFINITELY reccomend it."
2,Looks Aren't Everything,"For our third baby, I had my eye on this papasan throughout my pregnancy and received it as a gift soon after her birth. I plan to exchange it for something else, as she is 2 months old and has never taken a liking to it - and has already outgrown it. The problems I see from a practical standpoint are that the safety belts don't adjust to allow for Baby's growth beyond about 11 pounds (and even that's a stretch), Baby has to sit high up, there are no toys to look at while Baby is awake, and the vibrate function turns itself off after about 10 minutes which causes our baby to wake up rather unhappy. The Fisher Price bouncy seat from our first baby 7 years ago is still the best seat in the house for the Baby. This papasan looks great, but doesn't stand the test of time (and a growing baby!)."
3,Seems to be made for really short babies!,"This seems like it would be a really comfy chair but my daughter, who is 3 months old and 23 inches long, hits her feet into the hard plastic control switch at the bottom of the seat. We have covered it with a folded up blanket so she does not hurt herself but it seems to be made for either short babies or ones who don't kick their legs around alot."
3,This seat is okay probably for little babies...,"I bought this seat when our daughter was around 2 1/2 months old because I though ""How cool a papasan for the baby that vibrates like her bouncy seat"". WRONG, The worst things about this seat are as follows: the vibrate times out, the baby even at this early age could not be tucked because her feet went beyond the edge of the seat. The good things: the seat is incredibly cute, it would have been great when she was a new newborn because you could tuck her all snuggly like newborns usually like and she would have only needed the vibrate on for a few minutes to soothe her. That said I would not recommend this seat as a purchase must since the good do not outweigh the bad in my oppinion. My cat did howeever finally put this seat to good use claiming it as his own new bed, and he does like the vibrate, but not the music :)"
5,Preemie heaven!!!!,"I had my daughter back in July, 14 weeks early... She wasn't due til October! She was a 26 weeker weighing in at 1 pound 15oz. We brought her home weighing in at 4lbs 5oz and on a heart monitor and oxygen. We were concerned about getting her a regular bouncer because there was no support. I researched for a bouncer that would be best for preemies. The Baby Papasan came up the winner. My daughter fell in love with it. It supported her in everyway and for her being so small that was the selling point. It supported her head and her back with ease. We also had to make sure she would be comfortable with her heart monitor on. She loves the vibration ( she has colic ) and it does shut off after 15 minutes. That is the only thing that could be improved. She is now 10lbs and still loves the bouncer. I would definately recommend this for preemies!!!"
1,Like sitting on a boring bench.,"I have a Pier One papasan chair and couldn't wait to get this product (even though my husband said it looks boring). He was right! Our daughter barely tolerates sitting in it and, at a month old, she is too big to be strapped in since the flap doesn't adjust for a growing kid (length-wise). Totally disappointed."
2,Don't waste your money.,I registered for this chair thinking that our son would be very cozy in it. He sat in it maybe 4 times. He is now 4 months and weighs 17lbs so he is to big for the chair now. He never sat in it for more than 10 minutes. This is our first child so I am learning what to buy and not buy. I will save this for our next baby but I know now that babys like to swing and bounce not just sit and vibrate. I think he got bored easily. I did give it 2 stars just because one time he actually fell asleep. But it didn't last but 15 minutes.
3,NOT THAT GREAT,The papasan in my opinion isn't the greatest seat for a newborn b/c it's too big. It isn't reclined enough for her tiny head. It causes her head to fall forward. Best for older infants.
3,had to return first purchase,"I had to return the first purchase as the pieces didn't assemble properly. Given my other reviews on this website, I am quite disappointed with the quality of baby products! However, baby is now 5 weeks old and finds it very soothing and the built-in blanket helps keep small baby warm. If you're looking to distract your baby..this isn't it since it has no bright colors nor does it have dangling toys."
5,GREAT FOR CALMING A BABY,"Our son slept in the papasan for the first 2 months. He just really can relax in it. The incline is perfect; it lays back enough that he sleeps, but not too much that I worry about spit up. I am so glad we bought this! Plus, when I take a shower or fold laundry I just put him in the chair and take him into the bathroom or laundry room with me. He's quite content to just sit there!"
2,Not reclined enough for baby,"I am not too impressed with this seat. My son would slide down further and further until he eventually was almost falling off! Yes, it is very comfortable and soft but it should offer a variety of positions for reclining to avoid this problem."
4,Cozy Sleepy Chair,Both my baby and I love the Baby Papasan. The music is VERY soothing and the vibrations are also very soothing. I have two vibrating chairs though for the baby now because the Baby Papasan is great for napping and relaxing but we bought a different chair (the Aquarium bouncer) for an activity chair. If you are looking for something that your baby can play in - this is not the chair for you. But if you are looking for a place for your baby to relax - this is the chair!! It is cozy - the reversible blanket is great and has velcro at the bottom which attaches to the chair and creates a sleeping bag type blanket. the material is VERY soft and the baby just snuggles up in it. I love the fact too that it's not full of baby patterns - it is also very sturdy and easy to carry if you need to move the baby to another room.
3,No Entertainment,"While this is a great place for the baby to sleep or be seated...there is no entertainment value for this bouncer. I had to go out and purchase an additional bouncer chair that has a toy bar for him. He likes to sleep in the bouncer but that is about it. On a positive note, it is easy to clean."
1,Maybe I got a bad one...,"I must be the only person out there that didn't like this. Actually, I liked it just fine, but my daughter hated it. She sat very upright in it, and the strap was the only thing keeping her from sliding right out. All of her weight was resting on her pelvic area. It was awful! She fussed every time I tried to put her in it, so it promptly went back to the store. When I returned it, the cashier said that my daughter may not have been heavy enough for the Papasan and that was why she sat so upright. I don't know about that... She was born weighing over ten pounds and this thing is marketed for newborns. Oh well, great concept, but the seat could be more reclined. We're sticking with our Fisher Price bouncer--love that!"
2,Great in the beginning....,"This chair is AWESOME for a newborn. It's big and soft and we thought that it was so cute that we had to prop our daughter up with rolled up blankets or lay her down sideways. The music isn't to annoying, and it shuts off in a decent amount of time.But then, like everything else... The newborn stage ends... And this chair loses MAJOR points. My daughter isn't quite 3 months old and the straps are at their largest point and they barely fit around her. There aren't toys to look at and she can't make herself bounce. It's now sitting in the dining room and my cat uses it for a bed.This was the first thing that I bought when I found out that I was pregnant. I just KNEW that I wanted to have it. Now I wish I would have bought one that a) she could make bounce and b) had a toy bar for her to interact with. If she would have stayed small forever, this chair would be perfect. Personally, I think it's a bit to much for the use that you will get out of it."
3,It's great in the beginning....,"One visit to Babies R Us and I knew we had to have the papasan. It was by far the softest thing out there, and I figured if I wanted to sit in it, so would my baby girl! When Haley was brand new, she loved it (although we did have to prop it up with a pilllow underneath the bottom so she wouldn't slide out) but now that she's almost 3 months old, she prefers the much cheaper safari bouncy seat we bought as an extra. The papasan was wonderful when she was brand new, so soft and comforting, she would sleep in it for hours. For brand news mom's, I suggest it just so you can rest when the baby does. But, I only gave it 3 stars, because 1) the music/vibrations turn off in about 10 minutes, and 2) for bigger babies, it's not as fun as the brighter seats with toys!"
2,Save your money -- buy a REAL bouncer,"I got both this and the Ocean Wonders Bouncer so I really have something to compare this to.Everytime I put my baby in this he cried, the vibration compared to the OW bouncer is so light he could hardly feel it.The seat does not move -- so you can't 'bounce' the baby to soothe himThe music is VERY low it can hardly be heard and there is no volume.The blanket LOOKS great but if you have a kicker like I do it is worthless -- the little tiny velcros won't hold it.Boy does that rabit on it look cute --but it will be lost or put away the first week.One thing I do LIKE about it is it turns off after it has been on for awhile so you don't ruin batteries if you pick up the baby and forget to turn it off."
4,a great chair!,"Our 3 week old son loves this chair! He sleeps very well in it and I can carry him from room to room in it while he snoozes. Ours is almost always on the vibrate feature and the batteries seem to last forever! We haven't had to change them yet (after over 3 weeks of a lot of use!) My only wish is that it was able to rock and that the blanket stayed up better.. Will is able to kick it off without any trouble. The cover is easily removed for washing which is helpful. Overall, a very comfy chair for our little one. Wish they had one big enough for this tired mom!"
5,My Daughter Loves It!,"My daughter is 4 weeks old and loves her Baby Papasan! She's been using it ever since we came home from the hospital. It's so snugly and comfortable that she will take long naps in it and will even sleep there at night. She has reflux and has to sleep elevated, so this seat is perfect for her."
2,Looks aren't everything,"I loved the way this bouncer seat looked more than any other one in the store of course because of it's plush design and soft fabric. However, for the price that you pay I wouldn't recommend this one. I kept it because I threw the box away, but I ended up buying the Ocean Wonders one and my son just loved it. This bouncer seat doesn't do anything but vibrate and play music. There is nothing entertaining about it. It is great for when they are weeks out of the hospital, but that is it. Ocean Wonders is the way to go."
2,LOOKS SOFT & COMFY BUT THATS IT....,"I registered for this and god bless the ones that overpaid for it!!I wanted this bouncer because it looked irresistably cute and comfortable but as it turned out my daughter thought it was a joke. Her body only 7 pds at birth fell to the bottom even with the safety strap attached and she wasnt even impressed with the vibrations or music which constantly shuts off automatically after only minutes. It doesnt take much to please my baby she has never been fussy sick or colic in fact a friend paid 1.50 for a used bouncer that wasnt fancy in the least she loves to be in it all the time. My advice, try to resist the beautiful look and softness of the seat cause it has no stimulation or enjoyment for baby whatsoever!!"
2,My son did not like this at all.,"The chair is nice and nicely made, but my son did not like it at all. We used the aquarium swing more than anything."
5,Life Saver,"I registered for this item because it looked very ""comfy,"" and I am very glad I did. My daughter was only 5 pounds when she was born, and this was the only item besides her bassinet that she could use. At 2 1/2 months, she is still using it. I love the portablility of it; I can put her in it whenever I need my hands free, and she is perfectly happy.Also, she has reflux and this seat keeps her upright enough to avoid any spitting up or other problems. I would recommend it to anyone!"
4,Very nice but doesnt bounce,This bouncer is very nice but it doesnt bounce. We received it at our baby shower and I was dissapointed that it didnt bounce and the vibration wasnt very strong. My baby didnt like it very much. I ended up returning it. Its a very nice item and very soft and confy. If you dont mind that it doesnt bounce then its perfect for you.
1,So dissapointed!,"I fell in love with the chair before our son was born. I quickly learned that the plushy fleece is just a sell for the parents. The worst feature - the vibration has a self timer on it and it shuts off after 10 minutes. There is no override for this! So, before my son had even fallen asleep, the vibration would stop and he'd wake up! Another bad feature - the safety straps are so short! If he is swaddled or in a fleece sleeper, I can't even begin to latch them. He's only 2 months old! I wish we hadn't wasted the money on this item and plan to contact Fisher Price about it!"
2,Looks good but not very useful.,"I registered for this because I thought it was absolutely adorable. I have been disappointed with it though. It is definitely soft and looks like it would be so cozy and comfy. However, my baby slides down almost immediately after I put her in it. Her feet end up way off the end and her bottom is pretty much at the bottom bar. The only thing holding her in is the restraint straps which I always buckle, thank goodness. I have a small baby, only 5 lbs at birth so size isn't the problem. Also, it is pretty much only good for naps as there isn't an activity bar-not a problem for young ones but won't do once they get a few months old."
4,I used it for only a short time,"I really liked this seat but our baby was content in it only in the very beginning - I'd say until she was two months old. It came in handy to set her in it on the kitchen floor while we were eating dinner and a few times while we were watching TV (with wireless headphones so as not to expose her to it). We also bought the Papasan swing and we got much more use out of it (until she was about 4 or 5 months old). If I had to do it again I would only buy the swing. It's big, but you can still move it around."
4,Nice and Cozy for Baby,"Although this chair doesn't last long since baby outgrows it quickly, it is a wonderful place for baby to sleep in the early weeks. It's so cozy it's almost like sleeping in Mommy's arms. Our little girl slept best in here even on the night we first brought her home. At almost 4 months she's getting a bit too big for this seat, but it was worth it for the time that it fit. The material and cushions are so soft I felt very good about letting our baby sleep here during the day. It's nice to be able to pick it up and carry it around from room to room while baby is sleeping."
3,"Great product, but not for every baby","I received this item as a shower gift. I had registered for it and was very happy to receive it. After opening it and checking to make sure that it worked properly, I discarded the box. BIG MISTAKE!!! I wish I could have exchanged it for something else. I think it is a wonderful product, but not for all babies. I can see how it would be a great place for a preemie to sleep in a slightly upright position. However, the music has no volume control and is very loud. My daughter hated this because it is very boring. There are no toys to entertain them, (besides the bunny, which cannot easily be seen by a baby). I purchased the Linkadoos bouncer and my baby girl is much happier."
3,Comfy but that's it,My daughter doesn't like the chair very much. She'll sit in it for a bit but the chair doesn't keep her interested since there's no attachable toys. she also doesn't care much for the vibration so it doesn't help her fall alseep. So it doesn't keep her entertained or help her sleep. I wish I registered for one that actually bounces and has attachable toys.
3,An okay item,"I registered for this seat beacuse I thought it looked soft and cuddly. And it is that. My daughter spent alot of time sleeping in it as a newborn, but after about 3 months she didn't enjoy it anymore. As she is growing it seems that the 'snuggly-ness' makes her feel confined and without enough room to move her arms.We recently purchased a seat that converts to a rocker and she enjoys that much more.I would recommend selecting a chair that includes a toy bar... it will be used much longer than this seat."
5,Comfortable Nest,"Our 8 1/2 week old has used this since the day he came home from the hospital. It really does keep the baby secure and warm. I put it in the bathroom when I am showeing, and because he is so comfortable, my showers are never rushed. The music is loud enough for him to hear over the shower sounds. Most of the time, he is sleeping by the time I am done. Wonderful product."
2,Good for newborns...,I loved this seat the minute I saw it and received it as a shower gift. My daughter napped blissfully for the first month of her life but now that she is 3 1/2 months old she has very active little feet and cut one of her heels on the box that controls the music/vibration. I wouldn't recommend this seat (or any others with the control box placed by the child's feet) for long term use.
4,A comfy seat for baby!,"My 5 month old son loves the papasan. He has been using it since he was about 5 days old. He is a big baby (8 lbs. 15 oz. at birth) and is now 21-22 lbs and over 28 inches. This chair has helped me to be able to take a shower many days...I don't know what I would have done without it. My only problem with the chair is that it says it handles up to 25 lbs, but it is almost too tight now and he is 21-22 lbs. Since he is tall, his feet have been hanging off a bit too. With today's big babies, I wish this chair was designed to handle more weight. Still, we have gotten a lot of use from this chair and most recently we were able to use it when we started feeding solids. The seat washes wonderfully too. I recommend this as a must-have for all new mommys!"
3,Just Okay,"This seat looked so comfy and sweet that I registered for it. I thought it would be a great place for a newborn to nap. Honestly, it does pretty much all that it says it does but it really isn't worth the price. It isn't as comfy as it looks and the fact that the vibration shuts off after 15 minutes is irritating. There is nothing for the baby to look at and I don't like it that it doesn't bounce. The bouncing is so soothing for newbies. The angle of the seat also isn't great. We rarely use this seat and when we do it is always for a very short time. Check out the swing in this line, though, that is worth every penny! I'd give this one a pass if I had it to do over again."
4,"good seat, but...","my 11 week old has enjoyed this seat. it is comfortable and he liked it from week 2. it's been good for us, too - it's often the only way my husband and i could eat dinner or grab a shower. however, now that he is older i want something a little more stimulating. this gives him nothing to do or to look at. based on other reviews, i am going out today to get the kick and play boucer."
3,It's Okay,"I don't recommend this for a newborn because I had a 7lb girl and she was way too small on it. So small that she would slide down and her head would crunch up against her chest. This is probably better for a baby about 4 months. Someone a little bigger, but yet at 4 months my child still doesn't fit in it completely. She still looks like she is slouching. It does vibrate and keep her asleep and all, but it's not worth it. I would recommend a cradle swing instead because if you have to swaddle or rock your child to bed, then that is what you should get."
2,Not worth the money!,"I received this as a shower gift. We thought it was the coolest thing. We were very wrong. We tried it with my daughter when she was just a few weeks old, and she didn't like it. We thought maybe she was too young for it, and tried back several times throughout the next few months. She is now 4 mos. old and still doesn't like it. She gets bored when she sits in it, the music is not very interesting and apparently the soothing vibrations are not very soothing. When we turn on the vibrations she gets a very uncomfortable look on her face and then starts crying (which she never cries). My advice would be to get a bouncy seat with an entertainment bar or a rocking bouncy seat."
2,Not for my son,"I got this item as a gift for my son. He could not have cared less about it. There is nothing wrong with the product, but my baby simply did not care for it at all. By the time I would get him buckled in he would be squirming to be picked up. There are no toys on the seat, the bunny doll is useless, and my baby did not like the vibration. It was easy to assemble, well packaged, and the seat itself is very plush. Other children might care for this but I would suggest buying a swing or a bouncy chair instead of one of these sit alone chairs. In my opinion it is too hard to have your child sit in a small seat on the floor while you sit on the couch or in a chair. My son would much rather be at the same height as me. Since a toy like this is only good for approx. 5 months I would suggest spending your money on something more usefull."
5,PERFECT for just home baby.,"This product was wonderful from newborn to one month. This is all we used for that crazy time and that right there is worth the expense. After 1 month the swing took over as a favorite place to sit. I must mention though if you have a smaller baby the time you will use the chair before the swing will be longer...we started witha 9lb 4oz baby so he was ready for te swing before a smaller baby would be. However, we still use it as, yes, another place to sit. It fold up very slim so we keep it in the office to plop him in when we are doing bills etc. It is also great to throw a sheet over and use for a professional photographing prop. oh and lets not forget how great the vibratin is for a newborn with a touch of collic!!! However I do wish it was just an on and off vibration rather than having to reset the thing every 7 min or so."
4,What a Lifesaver for me and baby!,"This seat has been a lifesaver. For those moms that have newbors with reflux and obsessively worry about the baby spitting up while sleeping, this is a lifesaver. I put my little one in it after she eats and I don't have to worry about her lying flat and possibly spitting up and choking.My little one absolutely loves this chair as do I!The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I think Fisher Price could have added some toys to the front to give the baby something to look at. There isn't even a place to clip toys on.....But still definitely worth it!"
2,No leg space!,"Beautiful, comfy looking, great music; BUT my baby has no leg room. Her feet hang over the edge. The angle of the seat leaves baby sliding down and out. The seat straps do keep her in. She kicks her feet a lot, and her legs would smack down hard on the hard surface at the edge of the seat. Beautiful start, but needs modification. I think this would have been better for a baby with short legs who is perhaps less than 4 mo old."
3,It's okay ...,"Our little girl slept for many hours as a newborn in the papasan, but I think she would have slept as many hours anywhere. It is more expensive than it is worth. It looks nice - if you want something that will look good in a visible room of the house."
3,OK but limited,"As a new mom, I did not appreciate the difference between this product and a bouncer. I just knew you were supposed to have something small and light to put the baby in that could be moved around your home. Now that my baby is older and I have hung out with other moms, I realize that what I really wanted was a bouncer and the papasan is somewhat limited. Upside: its good for naps--for awhile, our baby did not like his crib but he would sleep in this for short periods of time. Downside: there is no activity bar/toy bar so its kind of boring for him. Also, the round shape makes it take up a lot of room. We kept it but if I could do it all over again, I probably would not get this. I would get a bouncer with a removable toy bar (except there seem to be no good bouncers out there, but that's another review)."
2,Baby looks uncomfortable!,"After reading the reviews, I registered for both the papasan and the kick and play. My son was a preemie, and at 4 1/2 lbs., I had expected this seat to be great based on the reviews. Unfortunately, he did not seem to care for this seat AT ALL. His head was pushed forward by the head rest, and there was no way to remove it or push it up, out of the way. I tried to put him in the seat off and on for over 3 months, as he grew to over 12 lbs. At no point did he tolerate the seat for more than 10 minutes. The music was a bit loud, the vibration seemed okay, but he had nothing else to entertain him and looked completely uncomfortable. The blanket was in the way and the bunny just blended in to the fabric, so I don't think he could even see it. He has enjoyed his kick and play to no end. I would recommend that over this seat any day, especially considering the price!"
1,Wonderful tool for a day,"I love Bosch power tools ! I've had one of these for 6 months now. I got to use it once before the front roller came out of its holder. Before that it was great. After that it was very frustrating. I took it to a service center. They had it for 4 months because the parts were on back order. When it finally came back ,one of the sales men asked me what was wrong. I showed him the front roller and he barely touched it and it fell apart again ! So I still don't have it. I guess this is so common that there aren't enough parts to go around. This is very strange for a a tool that says Bosch on it. Don't waste your valuable time or money on this tool."
2,Good for light duty applications only,"I am a small business owner and bought this sander to grind off the flashing on our polymer concrete castings (a material that is similar to cultured marble countertops.)The good: It is light weight, easy to use and very easy to change the belts. It has a variable speed dial and a dial to align the belt should it wander off track.The bad: It is too slow on the rpm's, even when you set it at its highest speed. It is also a little bit noiser than I thought it would be. It is about as noisy as a pneumatic. The belts are of poor quality. I burned through all of the belts that came with it in one day. They are also very expensive.I can see this being an excellent tool for sanding wood or other soft materials but that is about it. Now that I am stuck with a non-standard belt size, I hope they offer belts for materials other than wood. I also hope that some other manufacturer will produce these belts to bring the cost down to where it should be for expendable items."
5,grapefruit galore,"Love grapefruit. This is the essence of grapefruit, the whole fruit and nothing but the fruit lol. the online price is exceptional. My daughter couldnt find it any cheaper in FRANCE even at the airport duty free.the sad part is that the company used to give you 5.5 oz containers. they halved the contents and maintained the price, 85 bucks in the retail store, and now that the euro has skyrocketed, hold on to your wallets"
4,Not just for the ladies,"This is a refreshing grapefruit and citrus unisex scent suitable more for summer than winter in northern climes. It's sold in an aluminum container making it a durable travel fragrence. it isn't cloying or sweet and the downside is it doesn't last long. But if you want something refreshing and clean smelling that doesn't leave a heady trail broadcasting your presence, this may be a possibility you might consider. I also like and use Christian Dior Eau Sauvage, Hermes Orange verte, and Guerlain Vetiver so you have an idea of my scent preferences."
4,Careful plugging it in,The cable works fine but it's a little hard to plug into the phone so don't force it. The plastic clips on the end that plugs into the phone could easily break if you use too much force. Other than that it's a good cable.
5,outstanding,"In addition to everything you'd expect from a Falcon Guide--accurate trailhead information, good maps, elevation-gain graphs, topo references, etc.--the descriptions of the hikes are engagingly written, with humor and insight. Covering the entire Sierra is a pretty daunting task, but the author has obviously been hiking in the range for years and I thought the coverage was pretty comprehensive and balanced. In the two areas I'm familiar with, Mammoth and Yosemite, he chose some great hikes.The book is no substitute for local guides, but at least it should help readers choose a region to focus on.To me, this was much more helpful than its cluttered Lonely Planet rival. You feel like you're being conducted along the trails by a personable as well as knowledgeable guide.Since the other reviewers complained about it, I thought there were a sufficient number of few photos. However, a little black and white image is never going to do justice to a Sierra landscape."
4,not unsatisfying,"got the book for a hike from giant forest to mineral king. This book was able to help me chart half of it. The altitude maps are a wonderful addition, the maps are effective and helpful... If only someone would put a map of all the bear boxes in one place."
1,Should Re-Title as Day Hikes of the Sierras,"The title sounds great, BUT it should be re-titled as DAY HIKES of the Sierras. About 90% of the hikes listed are less than 10 miles in length. Silly. The Sierras are magnificent and about 60 miles wide.. WHY would you want to buy a book with hikes shorter than 10 miles. ALSO, the maps of each hike are almost useless since the passes and major trail points do not have elevation marked on it. Shows elevation of most of nearby peaks, but stops at showing the stuff that matters. Waste of money."
4,Boomer Nostalgia,This was a favorite book of mine in the late 60s or early 70s. Either my sister or I ordered it from Weekly Reader or one of those type of things that we all got in school. It's a great easy to read novel featuring mid 1800s American History of the Underground Railroad. I see that it was copyrighted in 1965 so I suppose there may be something in it that would not pass the politically correct muster of today. But I'd recommend it as a great gift for both boys and girls ages 10 to 12 or so. My daughters liked reading it over and over again in the early 90s.
3,Too much,This book is written in a clear and concise style. It is illustrated by very nice color pictures.The book contains usefull information but try to cover too many topics so at the end none of them is covered in enough details.I would not recommend this book as the first book for a novice woodworker.
1,Unhappy Customer,"The Milwaukee 0234-6 Magnum 5.5 Amp 1/2-Inch Drill was more expensive than other drills I considered. I bought it expecting reliability and extra power when needed. I used only once - I drilled four 3/4"" inch holes through one inch thick yellow maple. It did this without problems. I was happy with the purchase. Eight months passed before I needed it again. The drill had been stored untouched in a climate controlled room but it no longer worked. The drill turns on only when pointing straight up. As soon as the drill is moved, it stops. Maybe I shouldn't complain, after all I can still drill holes as long as I climb under the board and drill towards the ceiling. It may be under warranty but I need it now not in six weeks. None of this seems to matter to Milwaukee customer service. The time and bother of packaging and shipping is more trouble than it's worth. It's going in the trash bin and I'll replace it with different brand."
1,D.O.A,"This drill was new in the box, I opened the box, plugged in the drill and hit the trigger... NO POWER, so I tried it a work the next day and the same thing. So at the end of the assembly line did they do a QC check before it went out the door?... I wonder?. Also why is my Milwaukee drill made in China?"
5,"Get a grip, and make some HOLES!","This is THE drill motor when you're through playing around. Over the past few years, I have put my Magnum Hole shooter through it's paces and it is still a joy to own. I have used it on some pretty rough projects such as putting a 4"" hole saw through 1"" aluminum plate and 25, 7/16"" holes through 1/2"" 304 Stainless Steel plate. The only time it stopped was when the loose nut behind the trigger (that would be me..) had to take a break.It is the most rugged, hard working, dependable power tool in the [...]"
1,Why pay more for Chinese tools and the Chinese economy,"For most of my life Milwaukee tools (starting with my Dad's Sawz-All) were worth paying more for because of quality made in the USA. After too much time spent searching (Milwaukee/Amazon does not appear comfortable disclosing the location of manufacture in the product description, so you have to search the reviews to get the facts), this drill as well as every other Milwaukee product I looked at are made in China. It is not worth it to me to pay twice the price if it is not made in the USA/local. I can get a perfectly serviceable Dewalt for half the price. I am bummed to not be paying the price of my new drill into our economy!"
5,Does its job,"I'm not a contractor so I can't attest to how it stands up with daily use, but with sporadic use this Milwaukee Magnum drill has been solid, sturdy, and reliable. The drill bits are easy to attach and remove. The cord gets in the way at times, but that's going to happen with any corded drill. 4 years later and it's still going strong. Recommended!"
5,A great drill,"I have had my Magnum 1/2in drill for 15 years and it is just a great drill. I use it to drill through steel and it does what it is supposed to do. Based on that purchase, I now own three additional Milwauke cordless drills and a router."
4,Tiny Handle,"I only have one minor complaint (other than it being made in China), the handle is tiny. I have normal-sized hands (not at all big) and I can't get all my fingers comfortably on the handle. My little finger hangs off the bottom. I'm not sure how somebody with large hands would hold this thing."
5,Makes my cordless drill look silly,"I was getting no where with a 1"" spade bit in my cordless drill, and I needed to drill a lot of holes to run the wiring in my basement. So I tried a self-boring bit, and my cordless drill quickly started smoking. That's when I went and got this drill. It blasts through studs effortlessly with a 1-1/8"" self-boring bit. This thing saved me hours of tedious drilling."
5,A Sad Posting...With a Happy Twist!,"I have owned this drill for about a year. There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this ""old school"" power tool...I suspect it will run forever. Powerful, smooth, not heavy, balanced...did I mention I love it? I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event. He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year. The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee's management. If this drill is too ""old school""...then I must be too old school myself. This is a tremendous drill. Get one before they are all gone. You will love it!10/17/08 UpdateAs is obvious, Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill. A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar, that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available. I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill. Buy one!"
4,May inflict wounds on uninitiated listeners,"As the title states, this album may inflict wounds on unanitiated listeners. Since this is some of Nurse with Wounds most early material, it is a part of their repitoire that may be described as less structured and more obnoxious. Nonetheless, it is a classic treat for those who are masochistic enough to love the early NWW sound. Clearly a must for any serious fan, but be forwarned if you are not accustomed to out-of-the-ordinary music.In my opinion, this album deserves more than 5 stars when compared to the derivative tripe that's heard on American radio, but if you're new to NWW, try ""Rock N Roll Station"" or ""Spiral Insana"" first."
1,Bought based on great review - very disappointed,"I purchased both the DVD+R and the DVD-R types of the Ridata DVDs. In both cases, I have experienced about a 33%+ defective rate. My prior batch of Ritek and Memorex was closed to 3% to 5%.The first set of 100 - the coating material for the writing surface caused the discs to stick to one another. I wonder if the coating caused the high defect rate.I then opened up the second batch and found the discs to not stick to one another. The defect rate is lower at about 1 out of every 5.I bought these discs based on the price to value. I would not recommend this brand to you."
2,Not reliable,"I am just about through a 100 disk spindle of these using a NEC 3250A drive. Unfortunately, I had already burned a great many of them before discovering that they just did not make it. When the drive finally burns at a true 8x (about the last 1/4), things just fall apart. No actual errors, but on playback all the problems show up, massive pixelation, pauses, skips. The only way to use these, for me, is to burn them at 6x. Might as well have saved some money and bought the 4x ones.I found nothing but rather rave reviews on Newegg regarding these, but you look around everywhere else and people have much the same problem... they are unreliable at 8x speed. I also found out why the reviews on Newegg are good... they kick out the bad reviews... mine was rejected for no real reason other than it was negative.So, from now on I pay a bit more and use true name brand media. I have NEVER had any problems with any of the major DVD media suppliers."
5,Simply perfect,"These are the best DVD+Rs I have ever used. I have never had a single coaster. Even though they are only rated at 8X, my Pioneer DVR-108 will burn these at 12X. The problems that most people have with these discs are due to 1)old firmware, and/or 2)cheap DVD+R drives."
1,Terrible discs,Bought 100 DVD blanks - so far every one a coaster. Never had this kind of problems with any type of discs. Tried different software and burn speeds but nothing good. Very disappointed - at least they were cheap (...).
2,Deterioration in Quality???,"I've heard nothing but rave reviews about Ridata media. I've seen posts where folks had gone through entire 100pc cakeboxes without a single coaster. A friend of mine even attested to its reliability. After careful research and consideration, I bit and purchased my first 100pc cakebox 2 months ago.Well, now I've completed the entire cakebox and I can say that I've discarded 20%-25% of the discs. I could not pinpoint whether the point of failure was with the media, my drive, or my software. But after reading some of the comments on this product here, I'm glad I'm not alone in my assessment. I too think that perhaps Ritek has farmed out manufacturing of this media thereby explaining the deterioration in quality.I still give it 2 stars though because at the price that this media has been offered at, I think it's still a good buy.... even with quite a handful of coasters."
4,Works,this thing do works..I gave 4 stars bacause so far i have burned about 20 DVD's and found 2 of them had defects...so they couln't be burned...
2,amazon is sleeping,"dvds are less than 30 dollars now with 16x speedand look at amazon ,it is still selling then above 40 (only 8x speed)"
1,Got several coasters - would not recommend,"The Ritek Ridata (RICOHJPN-R01-002) DVD+R media worked fine for around 10 burns, and I was quite happy with it. Then all of a sudden I got 7 coasters and nothing has changed in my configuration. I am using a Philips SDVD-6004 DVD+RW drive that came with my Dell Inspiron 5150 laptop. I tried both Nero and Roxio and both gave the same results.I would not recommend this media to anyone. If you're using some media with your burner already and planning to switch to Ritek just because of the lower cost, trust me - its not worth it, because if you factor in the cost of the wasted coasters you'll be even, and not to talk of the agony and the time wasted."
2,BEWARE: Pioneer 8X drive only writes these at 4X,"According to Ritek's site, they are working on getting a full 8X out of Pioneer's DVR-107D and DVR-A07XLA, but they are not there yet. I'm disappointed because I didn't consult their site before buying them and expecting to write at 8X with my Pioneer drive.One would easily assume that a DVD writer, with a big fat 8X on the box (running the latest firmware and software), and media with that same fat 8X on the wrapper would be able to write at 8X, but guess what? Not true!"
1,Claimed as 8X but I can only get 2.4X,"I bought this product during Christmas but didn't use until this week. When I do the burning, it can burn only at the 2.4X :-( The disc itself is good, just the disappointing speed. SO SLOW!!!!!"
4,Verification,"i met these young men personnaly, and i believe they have the heart as well as the talent and skillz to make it. Don't sleep on this one playaz, this is what we like to ride to."
3,A Gift to a Son,"I cannot rate the product, but since the rating is required, I gave it an average. I purchased it as a gift for my son, who is remodeling my bathroom (last remodeled in 1980 by former home owners). He has not used the item yet, but swears by Milwaukee products. I'm sure he'll be happy with it."
2,"Now made in Communist China, and you can tell","Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However, if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route, and have succeeded."
2,Not as pictured.,"I chose this fan because the picture has 6 blades. I needed a better fan than the oneI had. When the fan arrived it was a 5 blade, not much better than than the fan I had."
5,A Classic Work on the Holy Spirit,"This work is a classic, though a little known one. I'm so glad this has been updated and reprinted. It is simply the best and most balanced book on the Holy Spirit I've ever read. Packer's critique of the Charismatic movement is especially balanced and perceptive. And his writing on the role of the Spirit is deep, on target, yet easy to understand. I will pound the table and recommend this book for any serious Christian.Mark Marshallauthor, God Knows What It's Like to be a Teenager"
5,Very Good Book,I was particularly happy about every-member ministry that author was happy about active participation of people of God instead of spectator.I just happy about his penetrating mind and depth of knowledge.I particularly recommend to some of Korean pastors who call Plymouth Brethren (Christian Brethren) cult because of their Church Polity. Ignorance no long a virtue.
5,Film noir meets SF,"I loved this book! I highly recommend it to computer geeks and nerds, especially (although you don't need to be to enjoy the ""ghost in the machine"" parts)."
2,A viewer,A HUGE rip off of the original PLANET OF THE APES. Number four in the APES saga.Th acting sucked and so did the action. Poor effects and directing. At least it has a valuable moral to it.
1,The Eternal War,"The worst of the five, this isnt even close to the caliber of the three before it, nore the one yet to come. All it comes down to an hour and a half of watching apes fight ""future"" citizens who live in a 1960's town. Get the the other 4 but skip this one."
3,Best of the POTA sequels,"This is certainly the most exciting, well-crafted of the sequels. I feel this story's slight inconsistency with film 3(when did Milo get renamed Cesar? among other problems) only serves to give it all a great almost Biblical-type significance. Also, I love the vague designation of ""North America 1991"" at the beginning."
2,Too many plot holes although excellent shock value,"The shock value is excellent and most of the reviewers nail that factor. However, too many plot holes exist in this movie. The government sends in its troops in small batches and fights them man to ape. No gas. No tanks. No air power. Why fight a mob like that hand to hand when you have helicopter gunships? They also didn't use even standard infantry tactics, just marched them in there straight up. Guess they never heard of setting up an ambush. I know the point they were trying to make but I laugh every time I see the battles as there is no way any military commander would fight as these troops did."
4,ACTION FILLED AND MOST VIOLENT APES FILM.A MUST BUY!,"Alright,it was the least family friendly film but the plot was more complex and it told a very effective story.The violence in this film was neccesary to show the apes' plight.This was the cheapest of the Apes films but it was filmed in a nearby futuristic(at the time)looking city.The police remind me of the Gestapo and in most reviews I call them the Ape Gestapo."
3,mismatched combo,"Overall, I like the rack and the bag. My only complaints are...the rack comes with the side racks so that you can use a topeak bag where the side pockets turn into panniers. The bag that comes with it doesn't have that option making the side racks useless. The products in the combo are mismatched. I specifically bought this combo for the side pannier option. Now I will have to buy the other trunk bag in order to make use of the side racks. Bummer."
1,A Defense of Very Narrow Perspective,"There has been so much research on trust in the past decades as computer-mediated communications have become integrated into our lives. The purpose of this work is primarily to reject those complementary perspectives as competing and invalid.To Russell Hardin, trust can NOT be placed in any automatic system. Trust is NOT behavorial. In fact, trust is only legitimately studied as a mechanism within political philosophy using a particular set of methods. Not surprisingly, those methods are the ones used by Russell Hardin, political philosopher.What we have here is the worst kind of territorial academic argument - more interested in dispute than enlightenment. This book will be good if it is at least the 20th book you plan to read on trust. Otherwise the narrowness, and the resulting required contortions in logic, will only confuse."
3,Fair,"If you like a fairly strong ginger cookies, these are great. They snap, they are spicy. They are a tad sweet, and I find that of Pamela's Simplebites line, judging on mouth feel alone, these are the most obviously gluten-free. They aren't silty like some gluten-free products, but they do leave behind a slightly chalky residue."
2,Very sweet,These are very sweet - or maybe it's because I'm not eating a lot of sweets that they taste this way. I also think they don't have enough of a ginger taste to them. Just my humble opinion. Others have rated them higher.
4,"Too sweet for me, but the rest of the family likes it","My husband and two boys, 3 and 1, all like these little cookies so much that all of them took more than the serving size. I let them eat them freely because I'm OK with the ingredients. I didn't eat so many of them because they taste too sweet for me. They also have a strong spicy taste probably because of the ginger."
5,The best packaged gluten-free gingersnap on the market!,"These are simply delicious! No hint of being ""gluten free"" in the taste. Strong, peppery ginger flavor with a good bite to the cookie. I've eaten both plain in crusts and crumbles for desserts. Absolutely delicious. Worth a try!"
4,good cookie,"well, it was a long of ginger in those snaps. Overall, nice bag of treats. Cookies arrived on time and in good shape."
3,Good for oreo pie crust recipes!,It taste like an oreo except without the creme. It does make an great cookie crust!
3,Wow Diabeetus,"These are seriously too sweet to even handle, they are sweeter than anything I have tried. They resemble chocolate cake doubled over with sugar. While being sweet they are also very hard.It will turn your heart rate up, I went from steady to 155BPM from this stuff."
5,Delicious,This product makes me know I'm not missing out on gluten !! So delicious & can be used to make a crust or ice cream sandwich .
5,Addictive and amazing!,"These cookies are the bomb! They taste so ""gingery"", unlike any gingersnap I have found before. and gluten free to boot. We have them shipped automatically every couple of months and I have taken to hiding a package or two so I can have a few before my husband devours them all. I also use them as the base for any dessert calling for a graham cracker crust."
5,A Whole lottta Ginger-Snap Awesomness!,Go ahead have just 2... I dare ya! Ordering was easy and the product came quickly and well packed. I will get more once my supply is exhausted!
4,My picky eater loves these,We first tried these while experimenting with GFCF diet for my son. He is a seriously picky eater and before these cookies would only try soft-baked cookies. The cookies are small and crunchy with just a little bit of a chewiness in the middle. These cookies have stayed a part of our household even though the GFCF diet did not.
1,Pamelas ginger snap cookies,"The 2 cases of cookies I received through Amazon were terrible, apparently a bad batch according to Pamela's. I have purchased the exact cookies in the store and they were great!! I called Pamela's and found out that there was a bad day at the bakery and that they would send me new cookies. Weeks have gone by and no cookies. I will call them again but its a pain in the butt just to get cookies."
4,A great chocolate fix for those on a GF/CF diet!,This is a great little GF/CF cookie that fills my need for a chocolate fix.
1,would give it no stars if possible,I took one bite and gagged. Tasted like chemicals. Left a nasty taste in my mouth. Threw the entire bag away
5,Delicious!,"These cookies are DELICIOUS! I get them for my son who cannot have gluten or casein or soy and he really likes them. Actually, everyone in our house likes them!"
4,Really good and hard to find,"These cookies are very good, as are all of the simple bite cookies by Pamela"
4,Very Tasty,"I wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake, but they didn't quite make it in time. No matter, we enjoyed them right out of the box. They are packed full of flavor. The big question, as with all GF baked goods, is texture. These cookies are excellent, very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy. If you've ever enjoyed Ppefferneuse, these will take you there. They are exactly like that, right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth. And that's not a negative, it's part of the charm. Really, they're good cookies, with outstanding ginger flavor. Mom says these are every bit as good as the Ppefferneuse she made for Christmas every year, and that's high praise."
5,Crispy Ginger Cookies,These are the best gluten free ginger cookies I have tried. They have a snappy ginger flavor and are very crispy. They easily can be crushed in a ziplock bag with a rolling pin to make a delicious pie crust or topping for apple crisp. This one is a winner!
5,Yunmmy Cookies,"I love this tasty ginger snapz cookies, so do all my non-GF friends.Thanks again Pamela's.Don Mueller"
5,Yummy Lil' Treasures!!,Just recieved our first order of these (they don't carry them around us)...they are a big hit with the little ones and myself...definitely worthy of a try!!
3,Pamela's Products Ginger Mini Snapz,"I use Pamela's pancake mix and my family loves it, so I was eager to try her ready-made cookies as well. Have to be honest and say that I don't really care much for the Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz. They are so HARD! Way beyond ""crispy"". I think part of the problem is they're just too thick. A thinner, wider cookie would have been better. On the plus side, though, they are very gingery.I'm going to try to soften them up a bit. And perhaps they'll be good as a pie or cheesecake crust, but just for snacking, no, I wouldn't recommend them. Now to think of what to do with the other 5 bags. :/"
2,Guess I'm the only one,"I got these on sale during celiac awareness month, I chose the chocolate chip. I thought they were pretty gross, and to me they had a funny chemical after taste, which I don't know what it could have been from since it's all organic ingredients. Ick. I wouldn't buy these for .25 cents a bag."
4,my fiance' 's favorite,"A bit too sweet for me (I prefer Mother's mini chocolate chip cookies), but they're my girlfriend's favorite. And since I just proposed a month ago & she said 'yes', I gotta learn to compromise, right? --I bought both brands"
3,Stale cookies.,"These cookies are always my favorite. They taste just like Famous Amos cookies! However, when I ordered them from amazon every other bag was stale even within the expiration date the taste was not the same. I was super dissapointed and it even prevented me from ever buying these again."
5,came on time,"have not opened it as yet, thanks for the quick service, I love the Gathers Music, and especially do I love this Song Something Beautiful. It is insperational Music and peaceful.."
4,reef sandals,sandals are exactly what I ordered. shipped in a timely fashion. Product a little expensive.Shipping as usual is astronomical.Probably would not have purchased the sandals but they were a gift.
4,Great Gift Idea for the Beach Bums,"Ordered as a Christmas present for my husband. Item was easy to order, delivery was fast and product is exactly as described."
2,"Graphic, but too amatuerish","John Paul Allen's first novel, which was rereleased, is not the worst novel I've read. That is one of the few positive thigns I have to say about ""Gifted Trust"", a graphic, unappealing, amateur-hour horror book about an evil disembodied spirit named Virago(or Hellhound as it translates). Virago follows different souls through the years: a publisher in the early 30's; a serial killer who also rapes his victims and often kills children and their mothers; and a gay high-school teacher at an ""alterantive"" school. There are too many typos in the book, and the plot becomes hard to follow, and the coda is superfluous. The serial killer passages are the best of the book. Allen sure captures a sick and perverted mind well."
4,Adorable,Very cute game for preschoolers and kindergartners. . . The concept is a mix of candyland and chutes and ladders where you climb up to the top and things happen along the way. Definitely recommend!
3,Homeowner's Best Friend,"This is a nice compact power driver for the average homeowner's needs. If you want a good driver for putting toys together, installing and removing light plates etc. it fits the bill. It doesn't have enough power or stanima for more arduous jobs. Battery life isn't as good as it could be and I still haven't been able to find replacement batteries. That's what I was doing on this site."
3,Milwaukee 2.4v cordless screwdriver,"My company uses dozens of these screwdrivers in production of electrical power system protection products. The screwdrivers are used collectively hundreds of times daily. The drivers theirselves are usually very reliable. The problem these have is centered around the batteries and chargers. We have had a fair amount of failures where the charger malfunctions and over charges the batteries causing failure of the batteries. Due to the heavy use of these units the chargers are in use continually as the batteries get discharged more often, sometimes as many as five times a day per driver. The problem here is the replacement cost of the charger is nearly as much as buying a complete kit."
3,"Screwdriver great, batteries and charger are poor.","I have two of these screwdrivers that we use for assembly - probably an average of 500 screws a week. The screwdrivers are great, but the batteries quit working after a few months. We have also replaced several chargers. When the chargers go, they overcharge, and ruin a battery. I also have a 14V Milwaukee drill, and the batteries don't last long on it either. Seems like a company that makes such a high quality tool would get it together on the batteries."
4,The right tool for my needs,Just finished disassembling and rebuilding 40 saltwater fishing reels. The tool had the torque to remove corroded screws and the torgue adustment prevented me from over tightening the screws when re-assembling. Battery life has been more than adequate. Far better than any of the cheaper varieties of this tool that I've used in the past.
3,Poor charger performance,"I love the screwdriver, however, the charger is not up to Milwaukee standards. I have two of the chargers. Strangely enough, one of them has the name ""Panasonic"" on it. Both of these 120 volt chargers have the main diodes burned out and another charger cost fifty something dollars on amazon. I am now trying a 12 volt charger to see if it will last."
5,Great Cordless Screwdriver,"This is my second set of this drill. My first set lasted a good 4-5 yrs of everyday use before a I needed to buy a new battery. And that batt lasted me a good 5-6 yrs of occasional use before I had to but another one. But this time I wanted to try a non-OEM batt which I got at a really good price (2 for the price of 1). Now, while using the non-OEM batt for the last 7-8 months my charger finally died. I was planning to purchase just the charger, but my other half said she was willing to purchase the whole set for me.I love this screwdriver. I can't used the one my work provides for us. It's too BIG and HEAVY for constant use. The Milwaukee Cordless Screwdriver is very light and portable and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Best ever,Much more torque or power than you would expect for a small driver. Adjustable clutch prevents stripping screws. Angle grip or straight with power trigger in a great location. I liked it so much I purchased two more for friends.
4,Kobe's Incredible Life,"I chose the book, Kobe, because I was interested in knowing more about the life of Kobe Bryant. I was surprised to learn about Kobe's upbringing and background because it was totally different than what I had expected.I liked this book because it tells all about Kobe Bryant's love for basketball, and his determination and drive to improve his skills. Kobe's basketball career begins when his family moves back to his hometown in America. The book also contains a lot of really cool pictures.Learn about how this young star athlete developed into an all star basketball player. Joe Layden does a terrific job in revealing what makes Kobe a superstar. I recommend this book to anyone interested in basketball. It is very inspirational!"
1,Doesn't work as advertised...,"I got this stand after reading the mfg's web site to ensure it would work with my 23 inch Sony LCD. The monitor weights 16.5 lbs, and www.ergotron.com says it will work....Despite it's advertised 18 lb limit, it wasn't even remotely close to being able to handle my 16.5 lb monitor.... It *seems* to be a great stand otherwise, and if you have a very light monitor go for it."
1,Save your Money,"I got this stand for a Dell 1900FP which weighs 15.5 lbs. This weight is 2.5 lbs less than the arm is advertised to support. The arm held the monitor for a day or two and then started to sag. Right now I have to put something under the monitor to keep it from tilting forward and face down. The joint that is failing to hold could theoretically be tightened with an allen wrench, however cranking on that did absolutely nothing. Nice design but a huge disappointment."
4,Great Lab Technique Reference,"This book is very helpful to me as a veterinary technician student. The guide is easy to read, and the laboratory technique directions are easy to follow. The color hematology photos are very useful in identification of cell types. A little bit of all lab techniques are displayed in this book. It's a great lab book for a student or anyone else who needs a review. I reccomend it to add to your veterinary technician library."
1,There are better ways to waste you money.,"As with Paull's other books, this work is full of inaccuracies and pseudofacts. I cannot recommend anyone parting with hard-earned money to get this collection of xeroxes."
5,Love it,"I love these earrings. Very shiny and the box it's well presented,but i think there's a big space underneath the stone that makes it look funny. there's no picture showing this, so you don't know it 'till you get them.I recommend it."
2,2 out of,"Heh so-so,liked Tuba Tooter and Gabby and that's all.Didn't care for the rest,but fun seeing some of these early toons."
5,My first Monica Cd,"This is the frist copy of Monica cd I bought. I only wanted it to get the song,"" You Should've Known Betta."" But by listening to the other songs I found tracks after tracks I loved. Especially the track 8,""Breaks My Hearts"" that is a really deep song. My husband enjoy track 9,""I Wrote This Song."" This is a good cd. I enjoyed it!"
4,Monica has Set It Off!,"Monica Arnold, known simply as Monica to the world, returns after 5 years of pain to deliver a mature, sexy album. What many people don't know, is that during this 5 year period, Monica lost the love of her life, her boyfriend. What makes it worse is that she witnessed her boyfriend, Jarvis Weems take his own life right in front of her very eyes in July of 2000. For Monica to be able to bounce off of that situation and 3 years later release a hit album takes a lot of guts. Although ""After The Storm"" has a great feel to it, ""The Boy Is Mine"" was the best Monica album ever. The best song on ""After The Storm"" is ""Get It Off"" by far. ""Knock Knock"", ""Go To Bed Mad f/ Tyrese"", and ""So Gone"" are some of the other highlights of this rather short album."
5,The Storm is Now Over!,"Monica came back in a big way with this album! ""So Gone"" was a hot track, I love her rapping. I dont know why ""Get It Off"" didnt make at at mainstream radio, but this track makes you wanna dance from the first second you here it. A definate party track. ""Knock Knock"" was a great urban track. ""I Wrote this song"" is a touching tribute to a friend. ""Hurts The Most"" is a classic ballad that will bring a tear to the eye of anyone who has had unrequanted love. I'm glad that ""U Should've Know Better"" is climbing in the top 20 of Billboard's Hot 100. Monica deserves another hit. Can't wait for the next album. I know your going to do big things!"
5,BEST YET!,"This is my absoblute fav Monica CD. Its good from start till end...theres is no need to skip any song. Well worth the money. I purchased it twice because my first copy was damaged as a result of being played so much! She reveals true feelings with ""I wrote this song"" (a dedication to her ex boyfriend that committed suicide)...This is a must own"
3,Nice but not convincing,"It's a good and steady Monica album, but has no real outstanding tracks. Maybe that is one reason why it was never released internationally. Songs like ""Knock knock"" or ""So gone"" are nice but nothing more. Monica sings them well - as we know her. A solid effort - but not more."
5,After Monica's Storm,"I remember this album when I was 16. I waited so long for this album to drop until June 17. I love this album and it speaks for itself. This album present Monica in a new light. Monica ventures into new musical areas. The album presents different aspects of Monica's musicality,displaying the creative growth she has experienced. This album showcases her natural development as an artist and performer who has created a large audience over 10 years. This album has been certified GOLD. Remember,this was 2003-2004."
4,Monica's #1 fan,"Oh my God... Monica's voice has improved so much and this album is very good. I'm so glad that Monica is finally back.... I usually don't write reviews but when I heard this cd I had to make an exception.... I really like this cd... the only reason I didn't give it 5stars is because I like last years' import only ""All Eyez on Me"" slightly better. With that said this cd is definitely worth checking out."
3,Average CD for Average Artist,"After waiting almost forever for this album, I was in shock when I heard it. That's an understatement. I wanted to return it to the store I brought it from.I took it home and played it a few times that summer it was hot for a short minute and then I pulled it out a few months later. I am a Monica fan other wise I wouldn't review her album. This album is less then average, but I gave it an average rating because I still like Monica as an artist. To put it to rest there is no competition between Monica and Brandy, Brandy's got her by a long shot and more. So Gone was a hot lead single, but then again she released All Eyes On Me a year prior as her first single. The bonus tracks are the truth, Down For Whatever and That's My Man are classic. But the album After The Storm is not."
4,aight,the first and last couple of songs on this cd are off the chainI love the cd the only song I dont like is knock knock knockbut besides that the cd is banging
5,Worth the wait.....worth the money spent,"I picked up this CD on a whim thinking that it would just get tossed in my collection, because usually what happens when ytou hear an ear-cathcing osng on the radio, you buy the CD and rest is [bad]. But let me tell you, this whole CD is awesome. Some of my personal favorites are Set it Off, and KNock, Knock. The ballads are super-sappy but the ideas behind them are great. This girl is super tough ad it comes through int he song selection and ideas in her songs, as you can see that she had creative input on several of the tracks. Overall I have this CD permanently in my CD player. Great CD, anyone that wants a good Cd for the summer, buy this one."
5,Simply Amazing....,"MONICA IS BACK!!!!!!!!!The CD is amazing...Monica has it all on this album. Hot beats, Emotional tracks, and Stunning Ballads. Plus the extra CD with the hit video for the #1 Song ""So Gone"". Monica is a amazing vocalist with such versatiliy and passion. Monica sings beautifully on this album and also raps for the first time in her career!!! None of the songs are ""fillers"" in my opinion all of the songs are catchy,beautiful,or just plain hot in general.This album deserves more praise than it is currently getting and definitely more promotion. The reviews for MOnica's CD have been fantastic and it is currently THE #1 ALBUM ON THE BILLBOARD'S TOP 200!!!!Go Monica!!!PS-Please don't leave us again for 5 years...She is finally starting to shine :)"
5,WONDERFULLY PUT TOGETHER!,"I had actually ordered this CD from Columbia House last November (2002) when talks of the release began to buzz. When it didn't drop in the US, I waited patiently until I got mine...SEVERAL MONTHS LATER! It was well worth the wait...I recently ordered the import (which by the way is HARD to find at a decent price). Anyone who knows what this young lady has been through can do nothing but applaud and praise this CD. She's grown a lot since her debut and continues to grow and shine as a wonderful and talented artist in her own right. I love the entire CD but find myself listening to #2,3 and 13 OVER AND OVER AGAIN! Her mid-tempos are cool, but the dance tracks make you wanna shake your money maker!!! Miss Thang is definitely BACK ON THE MAP! Personal tragedy can only make you stronger...look what it did for Monica! Go girl....Order now so you won't feel left out!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I loved Monica's first album, so when I saw that she had come out with another one, I was very excited to hear it. After purchasing it, I ran out to the car and threw it in the cd player only to be disappointed song after song. She has taken her music in a different direction...I feel more of a rap-like direction. Glad to hear that she is back, just wish that it was like the simiular groove sounds of her first album. I give the album 2 stars because I still love her talanted voice. Hope the next album goes back to the roots of the first one."
4,This is a decent CD,"I am Monica's #1 fan. The only reason I give this CD 4 stars is b/c it's not the same as her first CD which is the real Monica. You could really feel her in her first CD. ""So Gone"" reminded me of that. The CD is decent I still listen to it. I don't get why people are saying that this is a male bashing CD. U should've Known Better, That's My Man, Breaks My Heart and Get it Off are examples of that. I can't wait for the 4th CD!"
5,Her best yet,"I got this cd when it first came out and I absolutely love it. I still listen to it everyday. My favorite songs are So Gone, Go Home, Hurts the Most, Go to Bed."
4,AFTER THE STORM REVIEW,"This is another good effort on Monica's part. With the lyrical content, she has definitely matured. The lyrics now seem to delve more into her soul, whereas they scraped the surface in her previous efforts. I knew as soon as I heard ""So Gone"" that this young lady has really grown up.Stand-out songs are the radio friendly ""So Gone"" and ""Ain't Gonna Cry No More."" ""That's My Man"" is a bold statement about her everlasting love for a brotha that others may not view in the same light as Ms. Monica. ""Don't Gotta Go Home"" and ""I Wrote This Song"" are also stand-outs.This is a must have for Monica fans and an introduction of the woman known as Miss Thang, to a new group of listeners."
2,What happened?(2 1/2 stars),"I have been a Monica fan from the start and I have always loved her music so when this cd finally came out after several delays I was really anxious to hear Monica's new songs.Let's just say I was disappointed, Missy Elliot was on here way too much I know she helped produce this cd but it was too much Missy!Also I was hoping there would be""What My Heart Says"" from the ""Love Song"" movie(very beautiful&classy song!) on here, at least as a hidden bonus track but it wasn't.I did like a few songs on here but after all the pushbacks of this album I was expecting more."
5,I LOVE IT,"I have never purchased any of Monica's other cd's, but I must say that I am really impressed with this cd. I am glad that I decided to buy it. I can't stop listening to it. I also purchased Beyonce's cd, and I really think that Monica's is a whole lot better. My favorite tracks would have to be: So Gone, Knock Knock Knock, I ain't gon cry no more, Go to bed mad, That's my Man, and the So Gone remix. It's true that Missy can be heard all through the album, but I think the album soooooo tight. Missy is a musical genius. All I can say is that if you don't have it, go and get it."
5,After The Storm!!!!! Is Off Da Hook!!!!,"Enough said about this album and Monica did her part along with Missy Elliott, DMX, Jermaine Dupree, etc etc.. Whoever was stupid enough not to get this cd is a damn fool!! Yeah I said it!!! This is one hot cd!!!!!"
3,It's nice but...,"One thing I find very dissapointing about this CD is that there are only 13 songs on it. I would have expected an artist like Monica to have at least 17 songs on there. Or maybe it's just me because I consider it a waste of my time and money to go out there and buy a CD with less than 17 songs.I am not going to lie to you though, there are some really wonderfull songs that I really enjoy listening to on this disc, ""get it off"" being one of my favorites. I think ""All eyes on me"" should be on there too. I really loved that song!!! I wonder why she left it out seeing that there was a video for it. All in all, if you are a real fan of Monica, you will enjoy this CD."
2,I couldn't get into it,"I've been following monica's music since about 1995 up until the release of the CD I couldn't think of a monica song I didn't like cause the girl can sing and had fresh r&b classic beats, but I really couldn't get into this CD at all. It was obviously created to appeal to today's young teens just as miss thang did years ago for me but it's not as good at all."
1,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in this album. She's sampling too many other songs on this album and not using her own creativity. I was anticipating the arrival of this cd and when I heard it I was in utter disgust. It was the worst 14 bucks I've ever spent. The song I really liked (past tense) was ""So Gone"" until I heard the ridiculous remix she has for it. Then the radio just abuses it by playing it every 30 minutes. And is there really a need for 2 cd's? Sorry Monica but I thought this album would be a little more mature. Maybe next time."
2,Before the Storm....,"She was smooth sailing. Okay well sorta. Honestly this CD is one of the worst I have heard this year. The best song on this CD is ""So Gone"". However, that bad part is that the song isnt really that good. Simply put, I think Monica's voice and entire image is no longer needed in the industry. Her songs don't really appeal to audiences who enjoy real music. I feel as though maybe she should shadow Brandy and see how she revamped her image and sound. Word of advice to Monica: Missy can't make a good album for herself, why let her produce yours?"
5,The Storm Is Over,"I have been waiting for this album since 2002 and trust me it was worth the wait!!!!! After The Storm is a wonderful album and it really shows how Monica has really grown from Miss Thang to The Boy Is Mine to Now. Each song on the cd has a good story to it and you can feel the pain, love, and heartache she's been going through the past years. Her voice shines on every track!!! And the music does stop there. She even second disc full of bonus tracks!!! Overall it's a very good album and if don't buy any cd this summer by this one cause it's off tha HOOK!!!!"
4,Set It Off.....,"After a little break, mama Monica returns to the streets (yes, I said the streets) with a triumphant release spearheaded by Missy Elliot. The result is tight. Usually a sucker for ""neo-soul"" type stuff this disc was a pleasant surprise. I could do without the Tyrese track tho...but all in all, it sounds pretty good. The track Set It Off is a typical Missy influenced rap tune that is a certifiable club banger (trust me, I'm cool, I swear). Dont Go Home with X is a body mover as well. Really good disc from the ATL diva...Holla"
5,"Monica, is still Miss Thang!!!!!","It seems as if Monica hasn't lost any of her grand style since her debut song ""Just One of Those Days"". She comes across with her fluid alto voice and makes everyone who hears ""After the Storm"" see why she is a female artist that deserves more attention, airplay and props by the music industry. Shoulda Known Better, one of the slow jams on this album stirs the heart of anyone that wants to remind someone of their love. True, the songs meaning may be lost on some, but anyone that has a heart, should hear this song and all the others on After The Storm, and LOVE MONICA!!!! You Go Miss Thang!!!!!!!"
1,"After C-Murder, All U Want is a Gansta!","What is going on with Monica? When did she decide to become gansta? It really bothers me that all she wants to do is be a ride or die chick. She wants a guy with a degree and a couple of felonies, which makes it harder for all the good guys out there. Instead of talking bad to u and pushing u around, how about letting a guy push ur buttons and let him get to know u and please u n every way. Stop going after these drug dealers and set an example for our youth. Find someone real and make some real music."
2,I think it's still raining!,"Don't waste your money, the tightest song is with DMX (5. Don't Gotta Go Home)! So gone is So done! It was played out before her album hit shelves. I use to be impressed by her but those days seem to be over! :("
5,Simply The Best Of 2003-04,Monica is backThis is an album that i was able to actually sit there and listen to the entire thing all the way through with out a skip. Monica showed on this album that she was able to write her music as well as sing the H$$$ out of it. I have always loved Monica since i was younger and most artists that take that long of a break usually don't deliver as well as they could but on this album Monica was no disappointment and i encourage all Monica Fans And people who still love good music with people who can actually sing buy this you won't regret it believe me.. This Is definitly a great album.
2,Grab an umbrella and duck for cover..,"Maybe I built up high expectations for Monica's new c.d. but it was kind of dissapointing. There arent any stellar tracks besides ""So Gone"" which is amazing. Monica's vocals are flawless on this track and its outstanding. Sometimes Monica's walks the fine line between singing deeply and just sounding horrible as seen on the verses to the ""So Gone"" remix. Tracks worth checking out are: ""That's My Man"" a soulful number about finding Mr. Right, ""Dont GOtta Go Home"" a sultry duet with DMX that will definately get tongues wagging, and ""Down 4 Whatever"" which is one the bonus disc. I am still a Monica fan and hopefully her next lp will truely be a classic."

4,Ancient stories of an ancient people.,"Linderman has a wonderful narrative voice in his stories, retaining the flavor and style of the tales as they were told to him by the likes of Walks-with-the-wolf, Fine-feather, Bird-in-the-ground and Cold-wind, back in the early days of the 20th century when Linderman (called Sign-talker by his Native American friends) spent much time at their fires.By no means a comprehensive tome of Indian lore, Linderman's Old Man Coyote is a delightful introduction to the stories unique to the Crow tribes. It could be a great stepping stone to further study into this fascinating subject."
2,too simple,"A very basic book with little real substance--a thin book with few pages with simplistic drawings and no content. Explains all the obvious information about securing furniture and knick knacks, plus the usual safety boiler plate information that should be obvious to anyone with common sense. The information on structural aspects for the home are laughable and sometimes incorrect. I think I learned more in third grade about earthquakes than this book has to offer. There are many far better books on the subject. I'm sending this guy back. Yuck."
1,should be no stars,Item originally arrived 2 days after purchase and it was DOA. Amazon sent a replacement unit that arrived 12 days later. Upon installing new unit it was also defective. Ended up buying a rebuilt alternator from local parts store and the car was back on the road. All this alternator does is cost you time and money going to the post office to return it.
2,"Cute pictures, but not a lot of material","I bought the book to learn training techniques specific to a Basenji, and the book failed on that account. However, the book gets 2 stars because it gives a great description of the history of Basenji's, and their personalities. I found the book is better suited for you friends and family (that don't live with you), to explain why your Basenji acts so ""weird""... but as for training ideas, don't waste your time/money."
3,A beautiful book for beginners.,"Easy-Care Guide to Houseplants is a beautiful book to look at, but it is for the beginner. The ""how to"" section does go into detail with beautiful pictures showing you each step of the way. The decorating ideas look nice, but it would be more practical if they were silk plants. The placement of the plants is very impractical, either the plants don't get enough light or watering the plants would be a hugh chore.The Plant Profiles is just an introduction to houseplants. This book is definitely not for the experienced houseplant person who is looking for real information on individual plants. Experienced houseplant people keep looking this book isn't for you."
2,Trust my review not the others!!,Too simplistic. Too many pictures and not enough information. Even the info given is not detailed enough. Many common household plants mot even listed ex.the snake plant. I purchased this book on the great reviews and this is the first time I'm very disappointed. Trust me and save your money.
3,A Quick Read With Good Illustrations,"This book took a little time to arrive, but still arrived within the specified time frame. It is a real quick overview of growing most types of house plants. I enjoyed the diagrams that came with the instructions on how to build things for your plants. It had some nice decorating ideas. It had to be very general in most planning descriptions but did offer up new ideas for decorating with plants. The plant descriptions themselves are short and you need to do a little looking to find a specific one, but nice pictures. I refer back to it repeatedly since I am a beginner with house plants and have had no luck with plants of any kind at all in the past. So far all of my newly purchased plants are thriving and I did follow some of the advice in this book. I think anyone can follow along nicely."
3,Entertaining Checklist Of Ancient World Spectacle Films,"EPIC FILMS is a fun and detailed checklist of nearly 300 movies that are ""concerned with monumental events and larger than life characters"" that ""take place during the period of time from the Creation to the thirteenth century."" Utilizing that somewhat broad definition, Gary Smith writes with contagious enthusiasm about a wide assortment of titles, ranging from low budget but frequently stylish Italian-made peplum like GOLIATH AND THE VAMPIRES to stodgy and bloated multi-million dollar Hollywood extravaganzas like THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD. Smith provides informative and occasionally hilarious commentary and plot outlines, with brief cast/crew information for each film. Dozens of decorative stills and publicity photos are strewn throughout the text. The book offers a jaunty and entertaining look at these often spectacular productions and is highly recommended for fans of this mostly mindless but undeniably opulent genre."
4,A good book!,This is a pretty good book with helping someone who is just learning about becoming green. It has tips and ideas that if you have no clue this will point you in the right direction.
2,An outline....,"That's not been filled in with content. If I just need a checklist, I'll make one myself. Definitely keeping Home Enlightenment. Sending this one back."
2,Simplistic,OK story but not for adults. Too simplistic. Characters not very realistic. Won't read any of the rest of the series.
4,Decent student instrument,"I bought this violin to start my daughter on, and it's been perfectly serviceable. The natural wood and real horsehair bow were a pleasant surprise in an instrument with this price point, and the instrument itself exceeded my (admittedly low) expectations. I grew up a violinist, so I knew I would not be getting the highest quality instrument for this price, but for a child just starting to play, you want an instrument that you won't have weep over if it does happen to get dropped facedown on the floor, or if your child decides to move on to piano or flute instead. This violin fit the bill. It is well-enough put together to learn on, stay in tune, and have passable tone. The only problem I had was that the mass-produced bridge had to be filed down by a luthier to fit the strings properly, but that cost me less than $20 and made all the difference. The case was of higher quality than I expected and my daughter loves the backpack straps. Good starter package."
4,great to test if there is interest!,"my 3.5 yr old had been asking for a violin. neither me nor my husband has experience with strings. so we had to take it into a shop to have it set up and tuned. the lady at the shop commented that the bow wasnt bent like it should be. (but i didnt care its a toy). otherwise its a beautiful looking violin and my daughter LOVES it. only comment is that the strings on the bow are very fragile and dont really tighten that well. we ve already had to cut off like 12 hairs from the bow. otherwise, as long as you use the resin, you can get some good sounds. great for beginning stages and to see if my kid will actually like it (before buying a VERY expensive one). thanks!"
1,Terrible- do not purchase,"This violin was purchased for my daughter by her grandparents. It arrived without the bridge installed. However there are no instructions on how to install the bridge. Try as we might, we have been unable to get the violin to make noise when the bow is drawn across. I have contacted the company in hopes that they will advise. I would not purchase this again."
3,Okay for starter,"I purchased it without very high expectation considering the price I am paying. It is a playable violin, but there are modification required. First, the strings are sitting too high on the fingerboard, which makes it very difficult to play. I have to sand down the place where the strings meet the fingerboard (don't know what you call it). The bridge wasn't sand for the violin as well. The options are to have a violin store to custom one for you and will cost at least $50, or to DIY. I found a bridge template for the size of the violin and shaped to to a form supposed to be playable. I know the quality wasn't superb and I am not a musician to tell the sound difference, but I will wait until my kid shows serious interest in playing violin before I invest in a better quality violin from music store. So, if you don't mind a little woodworking, I think this is a economical start."
1,Not a real violin but not really a toy :(,"Not sure who this violin is for. It is not good enough to be a real violin but not really a toy either. Big, Big waste of money"
1,Horrible product!,"This violin is very cheap and it's overall, very cheap and unstable! The strings didn't fit properly because the knobs were loose! This violin is much too small and it is a very bad violin. It was a waste of money and personally, I would rather go out to a music/instrumental store and buy it from there. Although it might be a bit more expensive, it's worth it."
3,expensive,Love the product. Just upset it costs so much for replacement heads...29.00 for one is crazy.
4,Versatile Travel Bag,"Handsome Leather, and very Versatile, and roomy. Carry on is Ok if not packed full. Love It. Just Hope the Zippers Last this time better than the last one."
3,Kluge Bag,"The bag has plenty of pockets and stores a lot. However, it isn't very durable and is showing serious signs of wear after a few years of minimal travel."
1,"R-Rated version, NOT unrated!","If you're looking for an unrated version of ""Burial of the Rats""...THIS AIN'T IT! Sorry, folks, Amazon has done it again. This version(UPC 824255051132) is just another ""R"" release."
3,A horror version of William Shakespeare.,This made for cable movie was pretty interesting. Good storyline and a large supporting cast. Linnea Quigley has many walk on roles as one of the rat women. She doesn't have any speaking parts though. The only time you can hear her is when she chants with the other rat women. Other times she sword fights etc. A nice historical film.
5,Very good CD CASA!,"CASA was thought to be the CD that the heart that a human being hid appeared.Though it doesn't know Portuguese, I know only even music with the Japanese fully.iIt is bad for PAULA.jThe vocal of Paula is very beautiful, and feels to have persuasive power.It sounded like the cello of Jaqes of the back to ""the howl"" of the people whom it is suffering from.High sound sounds like the piano of Ryuichi like Dobussy, and it can bear a fine feeling of drifting.Though there is a tune of ""sabia"" of NO5, it is the strongest, and it is left in the heart.Everyone is to listen by all means, too!"
4,He still has it,This is a unique collaboration between Jobim who seems to have branched from his earlier roots - and some interesting performers. If you are looking for Ipanema you may be disappointed but you should listen to this twice - at least - then you will be hooked!
3,a little stuffy,"I wonder how much Brazilian music all the people who rave about this album actually listen to. This is a mediocre performance of some classic songs that doesn't really capture Jobim's feel at all.For me, the cello playing is what really hurts this album. Instead of capturing the beauty and sensuality of the music, it sounds more disturbed angry and avantgarde. It simply doesn't blend well with the music. There's even an awful cello iprov piece that sounds like nails on a chalk board.Though they are quite nice, Paula Morelenbaum's vocals do not eclipse Astrid Gilberto's, as one reviewer suggested.Much of this recording comes off as pompous and stuffy, and would most likely appeal more to classical music listeners than people who love Brazilian Music or Jobim."
3,North and South Worthy enough to read but not to devour.,Elizabeth Gakell is an amazing writer but it comes too close in contact with Jane Austen. It is like reading her work ( Jane Austen) with more inconveniences. I only give this book 3.5 stars. It is worthy to rad.
3,Rated PG - Not my favorite work by Gaskell...,"The only reason I rate this book as PG instead of G is because of the deaths recorded as part of the story. ""North and South"" is a perfectly clean read.This book is my least favorite of all the Gaskell books I've read thus far. The romantic aspect of the story didn't work for me at all. Still, the book is interesting as a peek into England's industrialization. I also appreciated all the extra information available in the Norton Critical Edition to put the story in context.Foul Language - Nope.Sex - Nope.Violence - A little: One scene portrays a mob of striking workers."
2,Too long and detailed,"This is the first Elizabeth Gaskell book I've ever read and unfortunately not very impressed. The overall subject seems to be the love story in our heroine's life, however, book tries to give so many other mesages that it is not fun or focused anymore. There are social issues, emerging new worker-master dynamics in the victorian time, continues questioning of death and beyond... Within all this it is impossible to get a true taste of a social, phylosophical or romance novel.Although I like the period books very much, I could barely finish this one. However I watched the series from BBC and it was very good! I suggest the series over the book in this case."
3,Not Too Bad...,"Just a quick review! The novel itself wasn't too bad, and Gaskell writes it really well. The characters are convincing, and she puts across the issues of the time really well. Unlike most other books written around the same time, North and South was a much easier read, and more enjoyable. The only thing that wasn't so good was the ending. It was so frustrating! I finished the book and was left wanting to know what happens, or at least a little bit more than what I was left with! Apart from the disappointing ending, North and South was a pretty good read. It was definitely one of the better books that the english department have given us to read over the holidays! :)"
3,Great story...but errors aplenty,"For the book itself, five stars all the way around. I decided to read the book after watching the wonderful BBC miniseries, and I was not disappointed.For the actual e-book text itself, one star. Lots of errors and strange formatting. It's a free version, so I was willing to put up with the small errors, as they didn't really affect my enjoyment. But there were certainly a few times that the errors were glaring and interfered with understanding (as previous reviewers have already mentioned).This was my first ""purchase"" for my new Kindle, and I was a little disappointed. I guess I've learend my lesson about the free e-books."
1,North and South- if you can stand it,"I have never written a review before, but I can't restrain my contempt for Norilana. This book happens to be the beautiful, poignant love story I have ever had the pleasure to read. However, this particular text has been so badly printed that it absolutely overflows, if I can use that word in relation to a book, with typos! It is so obvious that the text was never proofread! Norilana should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for corrupting the text of this beautiful book to the extent that I was practically wincing every few minutes as I discovered another mistake. I dislike buying paperbacks, but I would rather have a paperback with the pure text than wade through another Norilana edition of anything again."
5,Truly enjoyable novel! An Industrial Pride and Prejudice!,"I really enjoyed this novel. It shares many elements with Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", but way hotter lol! The sexual tension between Margaret and Thornton makes that of Elizabeth and Darcy's look like a cheesy 80s after-school special! Thornton is a real take-charge kind of man who knows what he wants! Mrs. Thornton is hilarious! The body count made me sad though, but that is a part of life. Frederick was an interesting character as well. I highly recommend this novel to literature lovers everywhere!"
4,North & South by Elizabeth Gaskell,"It's an eye opening book, just LONG, & tiny print. Seemed to take forever to read. Definitely not a fast read.But I learned a lot more about England. I'm Very Glad I finally finished it."
5,"Highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommend this book","I love, love, LOVE Elisabeth Gaskell. I love her even more than Jane Austen. This is one of my favorite classical romances. Ever. It is a romance novel that deals with political, religious, and feminist issues of the mid 19th century. Margret Hale is a moral character dealing with worldly issues, one of the aspects of Gaskell's novels that I relate with the most. After reading the book, please watch the BBC film!"
3,Font too small otherwise excellent,"The font for this edition is very, very small. The annothations and extra info are perfect for the serious reader or student (if you have good eyes). I love this book and highly recommend it, especially for Jane Austen fans."
5,A welcome surprise for a Jane Austen fan!,"I was told by my sister that I just HAD to see the BBC miniseries ""North and South"" based on the book by Elizabeth Gaskell. I am here to repeat that advice but also to add that you don't want to stop there! As a big Jane Austen fan, I was surprised and ashamed to find that I had never heard of Elizabeth Gaskell. I really enjoyed her writing--the story behind ""North and South"" and the characters were excellent. I also learned so much about England during that time that I did not know.I highly recommend the Norton Critical Edition of ""North and South"" as well. It provided helpful footnotes throughout the story and interesting letters and analysis following the conclusion of the novel. I also must again recommend the BBC miniseries...it was a fairly true adaptation, and the characters came to life! I really don't think you'll be disappointed either way--book or DVD!"
5,a wonderful book,"A thoroughly enjoyable book. Gaskell is one of the greatest writers. Unlike another reviewer, I found this edition to be easy to read and well formatted. Highly recommended and worth the price."
3,Pretty good,This book over all was very long. But it provides insight into many things. I saw the four part series on BBC and loved it watch it first!!!!!
4,Good read,"I am reading this after watching the BBC mini-series. Great read, though it may seem a bit unexciting at times if you've watched the mini-series since the mini-series followed the book pretty closely."
3,Good book,"Good book. Interesting take on the industrial revolution. The love story is refreshing, considering how quickly things go these days. Enjoyed reading this piece of literature."
4,I really liked this book!,"I wish I had read this first before I saw the movie, but I like them both in different ways. It's nice in the book to hear more of Mr. Thortan's thoughts."
5,North & South,"Love this book so much :) it's just as good as Jane Austen. North and South is a love story that takes you back to industrial England in the north and beautiful country living in the south, and two people with very different world views!"
2,Buy the book - but not this version!,"I've never read a book with so many glaring typos, missing words, and mixed up text. Some sentences were so garbled that I had to re-read several times to guess at the meaning. I also agree with previous posts -- the book size is ungainly and the font is not user-friendly. This book was published by IAP Publishing of Las Vegas, NV. Avoid their books. Gaskell's novel was a wonderful read -- an Austenesque heroine finding her way in the world. An added bonus was the insight the author provides about the encroachment of industry on the people and countryside of 19th century England. Find another edition, buy it, and enjoy!"
2,Small Font,"For people for are planning to read this for fun, I would recommend not purchasing this version of North and South as the font on the inside of the book is very small and could easily cause eye strain if read for a long period of time."
4,A Fine Romance!,"This 19th century novel is an engaging and touching romantic tale set in the dreary but enlightening context of intense labor conflicts during the mid-1800's industrial expansion in England. The author was a contemporary of Dickens and Trollope. She writes clearly and in a way that holds the reader's interest. If you love Jane Austen, you'll enjoy this book. Highly recommended."
3,Ending could've been better,"Saw the movie first and then read the book. The book explained a lot of scenes from the movie. In the book were lots of great exchanges between Bessy and Margaret and Higgins involving faith which the movie was void of. The Hale's religion/God was completely scrubbed from the movie as compared to the book. So, for this reason I enjoyed the book. The movie, I loved but they could've put more of Margaret's Christian remarks in- especially and at least with scenes involving Bessie.The ending pretty much stinks. The last chapter felt like an add-on from a completely different author. No dialogue between M and Mr T as per him having found out about the reason she lied to the inspector in order to protect her brother. Just felt like Margaret and Mr T went from hate to love at warp speed with no lead in."
4,Great Book - Excellent Movie,"North and South delves into Victorian social issues. Ms. Gaskell describes the role of middle class women in nineteenth century society. The main character of the story is Margaret Hale, a minister's daughter, although her mother comes from moeny. The Hales move from the south to the northern industrial town of Milton, The story skillfully explores issues of class and gender, as Margaret's sympathy for the town mill workers conflicts with her growing attraction to the mill owner, John Thornton. Margaret befriends Bessy Higgins who works for JT. Too late, Margaret learns that John Thornton is a forward thinking mill owner who does care about his employees. I found the terminology a little difficult at times. I watched the movie version with Richard Armitage playing John Thornton and it is a wonderful love story. If you have the time it is well worth the read."
2,A very basic edition,"I prefer hardcover over paperback and I wasn't too impressed with this edition, the only one available in hardcover. It's full of typos, some of which obviously are due to the fact that some machine scanned the text from the first edition and no human eye ever went over the text once again. Thus, ""being bold"" becomes ""being hold"", ""he lives there with his ilk"" becomes ""he lives there with his milk"" etc. First I thought those were archaic forms of English or some obscure dialect but no, it was just the machine... There is absolutely no ""bonus material"", no annotations, explanations, preface or anything else. No comparison with the carefully done Barnes and Noble Classics editions. Then again, at least the book is physically solid, good binding, decent paper, not too thin, not transparent."
2,"For lovers of the series ""Cranford.""","Since I loved the PBS series ""Cranford,"" I wanted more. The series are supposed to be based on a couple of Gaskell's books, so I bought Cranford and this one. There was nothing of the TV series that came from ""North and South."" The book was pretty slow going at first, but since I loved Cranford, I stuck with it. I'm not sure that to enjoy the ending you really needed all of the little details. There is a family prominent to the story that added nothing and wasted a lot of pages, in my opinion. But I guess they are there to illustrate both sides of the economic life. It's not a book I would read again. But the ending made up for all the slogging through I had to do to get there. Now that I've read what I wrote, I'd have to say that it really wasn't worth all the time I spent reading it."
3,a little dull,"This story, after starting off fun, with a strong female character, and exciting suitor, quickly becomes predictable story-wise and a thinly veiled examination of labor versus management in England at this time."
3,Ever so Jane Austin,If you don't like Jane Austin then you won't like this book. The book is a social commentary on the British class system of the 19th century. The characters are well drawn but the book's outcome is a well drawn conclusion after the first chapter.I like Jane Austin so I liked this book.
4,solid piece,The book gives some kind of a genuine feeling about the time and characters.Romantic story and Happy end are in order....
1,Don't buy this edition -- font size is unreadable,Fantastic book but this is a terrible edition. The FONT SIZE IS HORRIBLE. Buy another edition of this book! THE FONT SIZE IN THIS EDITION IS TERRIBLE.
2,Agree with others! Don't buy this version.,"I came out of my way to write the very same review that is already here several times. The typos of this book are proof of the shoddy editing - I don't think anyone even read through it before sending it to print! Furthermore, paragraphs aren't indented (which is annoying), and the size of the book (a large square) makes it difficult to read.Here's an excerpt so that you can get an idea of the horrible typos:""Their two nights at hotels had cost more than Mr. Hale had anticipated, and they were glad to take the first clean, cheerful for the first time for many days, did Margaret feel at rest. There rooms they met with that were at liberty to receive them. There, was a dreaminess in the rest, too, which made it still more perfect and luxurious to repose in."" See page 39.I mean, you can't even read it!! I have NO IDEA what this means! I love Elizabeth Gaskell's books - but she should be treated with more respect."
3,"Buy this book, but not this edition!","I totally agree with the previous reviewer! I love Elizabeth Gaskell, and purchased this edition, frankly, because it 'looked pretty,' which her books should look. However, this edition is a large size, which makes it ponderous to read, and the typo errors are quite distracting. I also would have preferred a different font. These are not major things, but to readers of classic books, the book itself should be worthy of it's content, and this one is not. A good book, but a poor edition of it. I also rate the book high, and this edition of it quite low, so am giving it a 3 rating (the book a 4, or higher, and the edition a 2.)"
1,Not this edition,"The story of course is delightful, but please choose a different edition of this novel. I went for the inexpensive price, but found chopped up sentences and too many typos to count. One of my favourites was ""lust"" instead of ""just""."
3,Another so-so offering with plenty of insanely spectacular musical moments,"A half-fulfilled album nestled in between Zorn's abrasive atonal trash jazz and his melodic Masada work, Euclid's Nightmare would not be worth seeking had it not been for the hand full of tracks that actually do feel deeper then rough experimental sketches. In telling fashion, compositions this duo jam past the one or two minute mark seem to hold most interest, letting Previte's deep sense of rhythmic drumming compliment the sax lines in much more convincing ways."
4,"good, reasonably comprehensive guide to popular music","This is a great book to rummage through used record bins, help builda good record collection. It's best used to introduce you to new artists. Evenif you don't agree with their general evaluation of an artist, most readers find therelative ranking of albums within the artist is reasonable. Some problems though: the jazz and bluessection is very poor is coverage (hence the other book that followed this) and they typicallypan any progressive music and love anyone once associated with their magazine (check out reviews ofYoko Ono and Patti Smith, ughh!). Biggest problem is inconsistent ratings across editions. For example,there is not one Doors album with the same rating across all three editions. Evaluating music is rather subjectivebut when the rater can't even decide what the value is, well there's little point is there?"
2,Mistakes,"This book has been very informative to me, but I've found some mistakes which makes me not sure if I should trust a lot of things from this book. I'm sure most of it is true, but still a book like this shouldn't have mistakes. One mistake being for Triumvirat saying that they were from Finland when they're really from Germany. Another mistake is under the discography for Spirit. It says the album, 12 Dreams Of Dr. Sardonicus, was released in 1967 when it was really released in 1971. I also do not agree with a lot of reviews in this book. I mean how could they give EVERY Black Sabbath album the same rating which was 1 star? This book also doesn't have complete discographies if the album wasn't released in the US which is annoying. It's also missing a lot of great bands such as Amon Düül II who deserve to be in the book."
1,Useless,"What can you say about a guide that doesn't give 5 Stars to Wire, The Replacements, Husker Du, The Pixies, New Order, Joy Division, David Bowie, or The Smiths. But they love Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, Bob Seger, and Jackson Browne. The book also blindly gives 5 Stars to the most popular artists, even on albums that overlap each other with the same songs. So if you followed RS advice, you would have several albums with very similar programming from the same artists."
3,I have to agree,"Two weeks of taking this and I went on a trip and forgot my pills. That was a long two days of caffeine withdrawal with a pounding headache.As for weight loss, I modified my diet, but did not exercise any more than I normally do. No weight loss has occured since I started taking this pill.Sounds bad - but I miss my ephedra ..."
4,Great start for an even greater guitar player,"What happens when one of the most amazing guitar player that no one has heard of joins forces with the best bass player and drummer for the first time? You get Greg Howe's first CD! Bursting onto the late 80's early 90's guitar scene came Greg Howe with a demon of talented first album. Joining forces with legendary David Lee Roth and Mr. Big bassist Billy Sheehan, Greg really put his name out there. With driving drum grooves by Atma Anur this one really burns. The production was a little weak, but heck....it's Greg Howe!!! Who cares? The guy ROCKS."
2,Shipping costs prohibitive,"I use one of these at my occupation and it is an excellent power screwdriver with plenty of torque, good ergonomics, and good battery life, however when I attempted to purchase one through Amazon for my personal use the shipping charges were more than half the cost of the screwdriver. Never mind, I'll purchase elsewhere"
3,Caveat emptor,"Both the manufacturer and Amazon state that the 1/4"" chuck comes with this unit.Quoting: ""The Milwaukee 1/4-Inch Chuck Attachment is an ideal replacement chuck and allows the same flexibility in drilling and driving capabilities as a driver drill or corded drill with a 3-jawed chuck. This replacement 1/4-inch chuck comes as standard equipment with Milwaukee 2.4-volt single and 2-speed cordless screwdrivers.""That is a false claim, as the two speed cordless unit I received from Amazon did not include the chuck. The tool, btw, works fabulously."
4,Nice compact tool,"The cordless screwdriver is very light doesnt' strip screws with the torque adjuster very nice. The battery is the only issue, does not last to long"
1,"Great tool, horrible batteries","This is mechanically about the best battery operated screwdriver around, although very expensive. Too bad that the batteries and charger are garbage.In my experience with about 8 - 10 batteries for three of these screwdrivers, if you happen not to use a particular battery for a few weeks, it will self discharge and the charger will refuse to charge it. Goodbye another $25. I've had at least $100 worth of relatively new batteries fail this way in less than a year.This problem basically won't let you buy extra batteries to keep charged. If you do, they will just die. So, you're pretty much guaranteed to run out of usable batteries in the middle of a task.I suggest that you buy something better.Next time, I'll get a screwdriver with a Lithium battery, or use a regular screwdriver.(By the way, many people who have tried to buy NiMH replacement batteries for this unit to avoid this problem have been cheated with re-labeled or misrepresented NiCad batteries.)"
5,Shoestring beauty,"Mostly hand-held, this B&W tone-poem to New York's lower east side affectionately sketches the story of a somewhat low-life critter named Simon and the world around him. Obviously made for less than the cappucino budgets of studio films, this one deserves a place in the history of AmerIndie cinema - a funny and lovely gem."
4,Good read,"This was a good book if you want to get an idea of how your Cornish ancestor may have felt moving to the US. It is fictional, but I still think it gives you an idea of what they may have felt and experienced. For me the book took on a more personal connection, because like the main character, my great great grandfather had to leave behind a wife and family. The only drawback I could think of was the way the characters spoke. The author made the accents and way of enunciating how he remembered the Cornish speaking. After the first few pages I had no problem with it, but at first I needed to get used to their way of ""speaking""."
4,SOME GREAT R&B HERE!,"All of Lee Dorseys big hits are here (Workin in a Coal Mine, Ya Ya, Ride Your Pony, etc.) plus plenty of others I dont remember from years ago but which make for fine, finger snappin' today. I especially liked discovering Holy Cow, Hoodlum Joe and Get Out of my Life, Woman.Plenty to choose from here: 25 tracks on one CD. If you enjoy singers like Ray Charles, Joe Cocker or Lloyd Price you'll probably like Lee Dorseys songs and styling from the 70's."
2,"Beware, this is not the original Hypnotic Tango","If you are a self-proclaim DJ like 99% of the Miami/L.A./S.F. 'house' DJs (haha) then this album is for you. But if you want to be authentic like a Chicago, Detroit, NYC, or Italian DJ where everyone know real house, the original 'Hypnotic Tango' came out in the early 80s by a group called My Mine. Get the real 12"" version which can be found in dj pools unless you want to be perceived as one of those phoney house/electronic djs."
5,Worth it.,"It was well worth the money and wait to get this episode. Like always a great show, well put together but there were a few editing / out of sequence shots noted. However that is by the side, the contents, the show and the cooking excellent. Bit too many four letter words though for my liking, maybe if Chefs want to impress by lack of language skills they should be edited out of the show."
1,more than a little irritating,"I enjoy cooking shows and some reality TV but this is more than a little irritating. Some interesting content is lost in an intrusive and bland soundtrack and repetitive, predictable editing. Of some concern is the number of (self important) judges who appear unable to handle cutlery."
4,Only Season I've Ever Seen and I'm Intrigued,I've never watched this show before and do find myself intrigued by it. This week's challenge was to cook a fantastic pork dish paired with red wine (to be drunk). The guest judge is very serious about his red wine so the two had to be perfect complements. Amazing that there are this many super artistic ways to cook and present pork with red wine. I just went and watched every back episode to this season as well and found them all fascinating. Generally I don't like reality tv but these shows where you learn something are a bit different. This is very much like Project Runway but about food instead of clothes. I like both shows and have learned a lot.
4,missing one song,"i love love love this album. the stone roses are such a good band. the only problem i have with this album is that it doesn't include mersey paradise. it's by far my favorite song by the stone roses, closely followed by love spreads. otherwise. it's an awesome and you should definitely buy it.p.s. i'm not david neilson. that's my dad. i'm a girl. i just felt i needed to clarify this. :P"
3,"Great music, terrible remaster","This disc was mastered at near maximum volume, so the music is distorted. I compared these songs with my old Silvertone discs (compensating for volume) and the damage was obvious. The only tracks that don't sound WORSE are the ones off ""Second Coming"", because that album was over-mastered in the first place.But ... truth in advertising ... this really IS the ""very best"" of the Stone Roses. I can only think of one or two worthy tracks that they missed.For more info about remastering and what it can do to music, see ""Loudness war"" on Wikipedia."
2,blue dot on screen,Received this yesterday. quite easy to use but I found a blue dot on the image on the LCD view finder as well as on the recorded video.So i am working through the process of exchanging this.will let you know what happens.so my rating is temporary-Subrata
4,Good cd not the best but good,"I am a Slipknot fan and I believe that some of the commentaries that I've heard about IOWA (the new album from slipknot)are not true. For example the guy that said that Joey was the only one that knew about its instrument the drums. This is not true slipknot has great band members that know how to play their instruments. That very same guy said that if you really want to listen to metal you should listen to some wierd ass bands that no one has even heard of. This guy is probably just a hater. Anyway, back to my opinion of the album, Slipknot's album is a good album. It has good songs such as Left Behind and Everything ends. The best song in the album will probably be Disasterpiece. I have to say Slipknot's last album was better, but IOWA does not fall too short from it. All the songs from this album are cool except for IOWA the track, I did not like it for some reason. But this album is worth buying."
3,not very good,good but not nearly as good as their first album....but check out left behind and the heredic anthem....those songs r pretty good
3,Lol at all the name-dropping,"Its a great slab of comedy looking at some of the 1 star reviews for this cd. All the 'underground' kids have their platform to reel off all the bands they like (or can think of) in the hope that nobody who likes Slipknot have heard of them. Maybe growing up is on the cards? This album isnt an attempt at death-metal, thrash metal, nor any kind of heavy-metal. Its there for letting off steam, not for marvelling at 2 minute long guitar solos.This is much closer to experimental punk than metal. Rap influences are there, and the songs focus on angst-ridden lyrics than musical showmanship. I enjoy many forms of music, beit mainstream or otherwise. Comparing bands like Nile to Slipknot is completely pointless. No comparisons whatsoever.Still, i like to laugh once in a while so ill keep coming back to this looking for some more death/black/thrash-metal/grindcore worshippers to bash this cd in a futile attempt to look cool.Tally-ho."
3,not that bad,"Slipknot is an interesting piece of work. I think that they are some very good musicians, and a metal band with so many members is a rariety. I purchased this CD when it first came out unfamiler with the band. I found it on sale, and heard about thier act and that they were pretty heavy, and through the first couple of listens, I thought they were a pretty good metal band. Even though they are sellouts (and my definition of sellout isn't because someone gets alot of MTV or radio play, but completely changes their style of music to sell more albums..When you do that, you can't say that the band is playing for what they truly love, but to make songs more FM radio friendly or to go with the flow, so to speak) ANYWAY, this is a pretty good metal album, no matter what their label. Even though I am dissapointed in the direction they took or the new album, this is a good listen for any fan of metal. ENJOY"
1,"Boring, generic poser music for 14 yr olds","I'm sure the kids will love this garbage. These weenies are trying so hard to be ""dangerous"" and ""evil"" it becomes laughable. Yea, if you the f-word a zillion times it makes you real scary. They basically re-hashed the first album with the same guitar riffs, lyrics and drumming. One indistinguishable song after another. It's basically the same thing you hear from Mudvayne, Soulfly and countless other nu-metal bands. Sleepknot sucks."
1,if i could give this less stars i would,"I understand why some people enjoy slipknot, they scream loud play their intruments loud and are in general....loud. That's about there only quality, i like smarter music, if you do too dont get this or any other slipknot."
4,One awesome CD!,"All those people out there can never call Slipknot a nu metal sellout. These guys rocked so hard that I almost died. [...]. ""The Heretic Anthem"" offers some singable lyrics. ""Left Behind"" is in my opinion, way better than the equivalent, ""Wait and Bleed"" from the self titled. Also ""New Abortion"" is very haunting as he chants, ""You can't take my soul away from me"". The title track is haunting, but boring. I saw these guys when they came around on offest and they played the new stuff a month before it was out. It was so great that I knew I would have to purchase it [...]and was very pleased. IF YOU EVER GET TO SEE THEM LIVE GO AND SEE THEM. They are the best live because of the raw emotion and dedication to the music. This cd is definitly for the maggots who truly love their music. If you want more singable songs and a better cd go grab the self-titled."
1,Slipknot's worse album.,"I love slipknot to death and im a huge fan specialy when i seen them at ozzfest but i was let down while listining to ioway because for some reason i just can't get into this album at all. Sure, its heavy,insane and all but i just find myself skippin every track here... I mean, every single track cause it just plain boreds me. For slipknot that is actullie good ? Get their self title and their latest album vol 3 ( the subliminal versus) dont waste your money on this album."
1,IT'S NOT METAL,"Slipknot is noise, just noise. This album sounds like nine guys taking their respective instruments and throwing them down a long flight of stairs. The worst thing about this ""band"" is that people think it's metal...Sure metal if loud, metal is fast, and sometimes angry but it's not this.What makes me even more mad is the fact that I've seen kids half my age (I'm 20) wearing Slipknot shirts and saying how their music ""speaks to them"" and how they relate to it. Slipknot's unrelenting ""anger"" is apparently driven by the fact that they come from a barren state. Well, cry me a river...a whole lot of people do too. These other people have expressed themselves in much more creative and artistic ways.This album is complete drivel...if you're ten and extremely angry for your age then you'll love these guys. If you're not, then you should find them as laughable as I do."
1,How rubbish can a band get???,"No eric your not the only one who h8s Slipknot. Ill tell you all as a musician they are, and always have been the worst band out there bar none!!!!All they do is make noise pollution. There are some some good death bands out there like Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir, but the difference is they actually have muscial talent and will be around far longer than Slipknot will be!!!I cant wait for Slipknot to split up - its only a matter of time! you cant go on making records of pure noise forever!!I can recomend somthing better, all you have to do is :Buy any CD in the world that hasent got SLIPKNOT wirtten in the front!!!"
1,if 0 was only an optional rating,"this cd is absolute crap... if you want to hear slipknot, buy the self-titled because it is the basis for iowa. iowa... what to say? it's a knock-off of the self-titled. the lyrics, don't get me started. the self-titled had some of the most kick ass lyrics i've ever heard (at least until I got into Tool and Deftones and Radiohead and some of those other godsend acts). iowa's lyrics are a bunch of big words crammed into bad context and screamed with a burnt out throat. corey needs to break all his pens, put down the dictionary (i never thought, until this particular case, that a singer should leave the dictionary alone), and just stop. it's not spooky or shocking anymore cuz it sounds like a dumb person with too large a vocabulary for his own good. screw this cd, screw it right in it's stinking hole. the self-titled is where it's at for slipknot. nuff said."
1,Music? Knot!,"Who let these guys out the basement? Well, 7th grade boys love it. (I am shuure, totally.)Nobody ever lost money underestimating the taste and the intelligence of the American public. At least they aren't Korn. (Now that band really blows!)"
1,I'll kep this short,"I hate slipknot. Slipknot, to me represents everything that is wrong with metal. They are pop death metal. If you want loud, listen to manowar. If you want heavy, listen to At the gates. If you want skill, listen to Yngwie Malmstien. If you want evil, listen to Rammstein. (...)"
1,REAL DISSAPOINTMENT,"I loved the first SLIPKNOT cd when it came out. New Fresh sound, very hard/anrgy album. Good to listen to when you're pissed off.Bein original that's what makes a band stand out.From metal they changed to DEATH METAL, not something to many people will like or buy. A lot of death metal bands sound the same. Hopefully the 3rd cd when it comes out won't sucks as much as this one."
3,just not my kind of metal,"Though I dont ordinaraly listen to 'nu metal' I just couldnt ignore all the hype about these guys. I found this album mildly entertaining, the energy is incredible, but there is a lack of quallity tracks on this album. Not true metal, but not bad..."
1,.........,I only gave them the 1 star for trying to make a good album. I just think they tried way too hard on iowa.
3,"Enough with Slayer, Kyuss, Iced Earth, Deicide ......etc.","Alright, we've established it. This album is not death metal. It's not even that good. Slipknots major debut took chances and was refreshing and entertaining. It was also admittedly nu-metal. Like it or not that is a valid music genre with many varied bands that some of you lump into your beloved black/death metal. Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage.... all exhibit more nu-metal characteristics than d/m. As for this album, it falls short on creativity but is a little heavier. It seems as though the art was lost in translation. Well, its all a moot point as all these bands, respective of their individual talents, bow to the almighty TOOL. It's just the way of things. Accept it. Start new arguments...............NOW!!!!!"
5,IOWA..hell yeah,wow this cd blew me away...i thought affter the release of their first album and all the overplaying of the song wait and bleed the second album would be mainstream and not like the sound of the first album... but listening to it has proved me wrong and they still kick ...
5,I WANT THIS SLIPKNOT BACK!!!,"I miss this Slipknot so much now after the release of the terribly weak Vol. 3. Iowa redifined metal to an extreme untouched by anyone else. It was this CD that made me absolutely obsessed with Slipknot. And it was Vol. 3 that killed that obsession... damn, I miss this Slipknot."
4,For those who cant apreciate slipknot i pitty you,Slipknot Ae a gud band no materr what people say this album lacks the clomplexity of the other two albums but all the same the lyrics are great so is the guitaring and everything else but the majour problem is that the words cant be heard very well meaning you need to listen hard so people will just shunt it off. I pitty you.
3,Decent but nothing special,"I almost wrote a glowing review of this CD the day after I bought it, but unfortunately it is getting worse instead of better with each listen. The trademark sound and fury is there, but I was hoping for a bit more. The biggest problem is that the lyrics range from uninspired to downright stupid (""If you're 555 then I'm 666"". Give me a break...) Every song is simply more of the same ""I hate you more than I did last time"" jibberish and it gets real old real fast.Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of the whole Nu-metal sound, but Slipknot's debut is still one of my all-time favorite disks. I have the feeling ""Iowa"" will be collecting dust on my shelf before too long, especially with brilliant albums like System of a Down's ""Toxicity"" out. Give them credit for one thing: this is an uncompromising CD and they didn't water their sound down like so many other bands do after a kick-a$$ first album. Kudos for that, but a little more creativity next time would be nice."
1,Talentless Garbage...,"Dont get me wrong, im a fan of hardcore music. However, i just find Slipknot, and this album ""Iowa"" especially, to be unnecessary noise, and the only reason it sells is because their idiotic masks and unusual # of band members is something a lot of idiots out there will buy. Terrible, try some System of a Down or Disturbed."
1,My Ears Hurt Mommy,"Slipknot is so bad i'm amazed that anyone actually treats them seriously (wait, does anybody?) Lyric-wise, couldn't get much worse. With 9 members, they cant all possibly be doing something to comtribute to the (horrible) music. guitar work doesn't exist, you can barely hear the guitars anyway, and if you can, it's the same chord over and over. People think slipknot is the heavyest and scaryest band around because they dress up like youre going to the circus. Amazing how the record company treats an untalented bunch of posers like the best thing in metal and no one's ever heard of bands that deserve recognition. Next time you go to the store, why dont you check out some REAL metal such as Soilwork, Meshuggah, At the Gates, Opeth, In Flames, and Dark Tranquillity (I could go on forever)."
5,THIS IS NOT NU METAL,"Really what's nu metal about it only a couple of scratches and that's it.Man this album made many nu metal fans dissapointed cause really is just a ""heavy brutal"" album.If you want something heaviesh get this,is slipknot's best album ever the heaviest they have done and who know's how ""heavy"" their new album will be.Iowa is the heaviset so far better than vol 3 it has trash and some death metal going on but still not there.Trust me when you hear this it won't sound NU metal it's just a great heavy album that would make you wish slipknot sounded more like this.If someone told me if i think slipknot is brutal i would just tell them yeah in their album iowa it's heavy yeah!"
2,Slipknot has gotten old!!!,Slipknot's A band that at first you may like them but later get very tired of(especially the screaming in every track)And I have no intention of buying there next cd.
3,not what i was expecting,"man, this album is a huge letdown. i really like their first and listen to it all the time so naturally i was excited to run out and buy iowa. then i listened and didn't really like it so well, but i thought that if i gave it some more listening to i would start to like it better, as some good albums are, it takes a couple of days to get the feel of it.not iowa though. it's ok but definatly not near as good as the first. dumb lyrics and rehashed riffs don't make for a good album."
1,a band that wasnt what i had hoped,"i never bought this cd, mostly because my friend brought it over to my house and told me i had to listen and i was disgusted. i've been told these guys have some great drumming. i was not really impressed. they have what, 3 drummers? if you want som nice heavy drumming, listen to chimaira. and they don't need 3 drummers to make it sound huge."
3,not too bad,"I really like the riffs and style and it has really good production, but it sucks on how SOLD OUT SATANIC the words are.Good music though."
1,the pits,"right 1 hour or so of utter noise, like someone taped the sound of a demolition site and added a bit of growling-sound appealing? then join the ranks of the undead who have got this-otherwise leave well alone."
1,waste of plastic.,"this cd sucks. i can't think of a single good thing about it - poor vocals, dull guitars, average drumming, and redundant song-structures. there is nothing about this cd that would make me want to buy it. this is not real metal -"
2,[bad],"You can play all the guitars on this cd with one or two fingers. There's like 9 people in this band, so you'd think they could play something technical."
3,it's alright,"I don't know, maybe I'm actually starting to show my age. I'm not really hearing much new here that's worth the hype. The songwriting is weak and suprisingly so is the production. I can envision hordes of 13 year olds wearing slipknot shirts. I'd be one to I'm sure if I was 13 again."
2,BORING,"I am a longtime fan of metal music. I am not your average mullet-headed metal maniac, I enjoy many styles of music. I loved the first Slipknot album. They pushed the boundaries of nu metal and mixed it with a heavy death metal influence. What pushed the band over the edge was their ingenious and creative use of percussion, mixing, and samples.On this album, they seem to have forgotten what it is that made them so unique. There is little that is innovative on this album. All of the songs tend to blend together as if they were written in one uninspired session. Gone are the techniques that set them apart. Instead, we are met with song after song of unoriginal heavy metal.If you are a metalhead with no taste, you will love this album. If you are looking for something creative, buy Mudvayne or System of a Down."
1,WE WILL NEVER SELL OUT WE ARE HARDCORE,"Blah blah blah, way to tone down your songs for the radio. Way to release the same album about 6 times with slight changes so hardcore fans have to buy each. Way to have some of the most pathetic lyrics in the world. Listen to some Killswitch Engage and the new Soilwork is you want real metal"
2,9 members????,"I tell you what would be diffrent,i mean really diffrent,a nu-metal band playing a song about how good it is to be alive and that klife isn't so bad but its not going to happen,so we're stuck with slipknot.well they wear masks that are quite well made,but apart from that theres not much left to be said about them.somehow they have become amazingly popular possibly down tro the fact that they wear masks.oh i've just thought of a good point for slipknot,the mask manufacturing industry must be bomming.recesion?who said recesion?"
3,IS THIS MUSIC?!,"If you like to listen to 1 hour of cussing and screaming, then you should buy this CD, but if not then don't waste your time reading this review. I can tell you this, I don't know how an album like this could be released! Slipknot's first album had a better sound to it, this is just noise and language that's it. The only song worth hearing is ""Left Behind"" other than that, this is a waste of time!"
1,Not Music!!!,"I don't know how anyone can bare to listen to this. You can't even figure out the lyrics and there is no cordination in the music. All I hear is a bunch of screaming, wailing people over junk guitar which plays one chord or at least it seems that way. Do yourself a favour and forget this album and go and listen to some true music such as Metallica, Ozzy, Alice In Chains, Creed or if you please Nirvana."
1,Same as the last one!,"This cd is even worse than the last one they came out with. These guys have no musical talent at all. It all sounds the same, boring and annoying! Dont get this cd, I dont see how these guys could have fans."
4,Banana Peel,"That is what this is, it is where Slipknot will slip and produce their next album, I would say buy it because it is a good CD, but it isn't as good as their first... So consider yourself warned!"
4,Loud and Angry,"First of all, I want to make something clear. Slipknot is NOT mere metal. They are metalcore. (They are not intense enough to be grindcore, so I hesitate to say that they ""grind"".) They are not heavy metal, they are not nu metal, they are not thrash metal; they are metalcore, and it is nothing like your MTV metal.That said, with its loud, down-tuned guitars, this album is heavier than their self-titled, but it's not quite as fast. However, creatively, it is more refined, with some better tunes and less chaotic noise. Don't worry, though, the industry hasn't killed them despite their unlikely popularity: They are as angry and as frustrated as ever and do not hesitate to make this known, through the gutteral yelling, blistering drums, and crushing guitars.The only thing lacking is the lyrics. They're not poetic or creative at all; just full of anger and bitterness, the motif of any metalcore band. But I don't think this genre is known for the best lyrics, so it suits me just fine."
3,Not As Good As The Debut,"'Iowa' is a sweet cd, don't get me wrong. But it nowhere near compares to the sheer murderous rage and beautifully grotesque lyrics and music of the debut. This cds high points are the tracks ""Disasterpiece"" (one of Slipknot's best songs), ""Everything Ends"", ""Left Behind"" and ""Metabolic"". The weak points are the lyrics which are far from the genius of the debut. Overall, this cd belongs in your collection but don't expect it to be better than 'Slipknot'."
3,New Slipknot Much the Same as the Old Slipknot,"Like their previous release, Slipknot relies on unimaginative overdone speed riffs and screaming to sell records, it just becomes so boring. At times though the band shows its ability to write some very clever songs, like ""Left Behind Full"", just really really clever, but its so drowned out by yelling and monotonous playing that its almost not worth listening to. Almost that is. Other really good songs, Everything Ends, which has some really cool riffs, but same story, just drowned out by really unimaginitive playing."
4,Not as Good as the 1st CD,I didn't enjoy the change in sound on Iowa from what was on the self-titled CD. It seems more like a Hatebreed CD than Slipknot. More straight-up hardcore and not as rhythimic. But decide for yourself and not by the reviews. Still a kick ass CD though!
2,Could be ALOT better...,"First of all, I am a huge fan of slipknot. Secondly, their self-titled debut is definitely a better choice than ""Iowa"". ""Iowa"" is heavy, just not in an original and well-organized way. There's not much change in any of the songs as the album progresses, and the whole album just seems very linear. While ""Slipknot"" was unique in that it's vocals, melodies, and riffs varied throughtout the album, ""Iowa"" doesn't deliver as much personality and color. It's just all thrash - all the way through, and not much more."
1,THIS CD (...),"Alright, this is completely and utterly garbage.The lyrics are unbelieveably disturbing and these (...)freaks are obviouslyno talent (...)artists.No offense to you Slipknot fans because we all have our own opinions and like are own music and thats what makes everyone unique and individual, but all the same i do not recommend this cd. Indstead try System Of A Down or Gorrilaz or something. thanks for reading this. PEACE"
1,"Come on, it's just bad","Their first album was sort of entertaining, but this is just awful. Anger without reason. I'll take Morbid Angel outtakes over this...and I dont even like Morbid Angel. And the lyrics...wow, eighth grade was tough, man. But swearing is sooooooo cool."
4,A big surprise,"After not being all too thrilled by their debut album, I wasn't sure what to expect with ""Iowa"". I had heard it be compared to Slayer's classic ""Reign in Blood"" in terms of extreme metal, and I did not believe it. WHile ""Iowa"" isn't on the same level of creativity as ""Reign in Blood"", I will say this, Slipknot is not just another trend metal band. Behind the masks and outfits there is a real band, and a good band at that. ""Heretic Anthem"", ""New Abortion"", and my favorite, the epic 15 minute title track, are Slipknot's best songs ever. In terms of ferocity, the band is explosive, and the riffs and beats are pounding, Joey Jordinson is one of the best drummers in metal today, and it shows throughout the album. Slipknot's ""Iowa"" is what Slayer's ""Reign in Blood"" was 15 years ago, the most extreme metal release on a major label."
2,big dissapointment,"Slipknot's new release is a big let down. All the songs sound the same and the lyrics sound like the same words only rearranged. This CD came out of my player suprisingly quick. Self-titled was much better. Don't buy this unless you're 14, or a hardcore knot fan."
3,Hard To Follow By At Times...,"Slipknot is a great band, don't get me wrong. However, this disc can be hard to follow by at times. The only song I know of that I can easily follow to on this record is ""Left Behind"". Guitar work and such is great. ""My Plague"" is a song that's harder to follow by, and ""The Heretic Anthem"", that tends to get boring at times...I'd just download a few songs off this album. It's really not worth your money. ""Vol. 3"" is a great album, since it has the guitar solos and it's easier to follow by."
2,Dont recomend this CD.....,This album is very repetative. All the songs sound the same and are poorly done. The title track is 15 minutes of sh** if you ask me. I would not want to waste 15 minutes of my life listening to that song. Recommend Metallica or Motograter over this CD anytime.
4,a gift to all metal listeners,"this album is just 66 minutes of pure entertainment. while slipknot kept their same death metal appearences and sound, they uped the speed with Iowa. if you heard them play people=s***, the heretic anthem, and disasterpiece at ozzfest, you know what i mean. only four stars because they still aren't a black sabbath. this album is definetly worth your money."
4,Iowa review,"this cd is really good. I think it's much better than their first one and the songs r speeding and thrashing. i listened to a lot of hard rock albums and i have to say that this is one of the best. reccomendations: drowning pool, godsmack, powerman 5000, pantera, deftones, kottonmouthkings system of a down and much more"
5,THIS ALBUM CARRIES A LITTLE MORE MELODY,"Corey sings a little bit more in this one, but the first album established a sound that is uncomparable to any other! He would scream and almost laugh at the sametime(eyeless). His voice was much more intimidating, he sounded more insane. But dont get me wrong i love IOWA it aint as raw as the first, it has songs like 'the plague' that remind me of songs from the first album(me inside). ...."
5,SIC 6 SIC!,"I wasn't sure about this album before it came out. I didn't know how Slipknot could come up with more songs that could compare to their first album. BUT THEY DID! I am so amazed by this album.... But is it better? Yes and No. Some songs are and some aren't. Theres a few songs with some catchy melodic stuff in there and some just pure .... Overall I don't think this CD is better than their first, but it is definately up to par. I definately recommend it to previous Slipknot fans, you won't be dissapointed. Great job by Slipknot on this and I'm going to see you live SEPTEMBER 26!...."
5,"Best metal album ever, HANDS DOWN!!!","I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. This is one the greatest cds i have ever heard. They are harder then ever, and better then ever. They're useing all 9 members to fullest,loudest, greatest, etc. potential. I highly suggest this album to anyone who likes crazy death metal."
2,eh. not their best,i am very dissapointed by this cd. it lacks what their fisrt and third cds have. the songs here just dont sound melodic. they really just sound like someone hitting a cat. if your looking for good slipknot check out their other 2 cds
1,Nu-Metal wannabes!,"Terrible stuff is on this cd. These guys are Opeth,Slayer, and In Flames wannabes.Slipknot is MTV hardcore which is a bad thing. These guys are terrible and this cd is NO exception!"
1,Slipknot shouldn't be considered music...,"I don't know why I have this CD, I think the only reason I have it is because I stole it. Anyways, you seriously have to be deaf or have some kind of mental disorder to consider this music. Slipknot has no talent, it literally took me about 10 minutes to play all their songs perfectly on guitar. This CD was almost well worth stealing, the only purpose it served was flinging it from my window at the annoying neighbor kid. I don't know why everyone in my school likes them so much. I guess you would like this if you hate everyone or if you 'Have issues'..."
5,SLIPKNOT ROCKS,SLIPKNOT ARE FOR KOOL PEOPEL ONLY PEOPLE WHO GAVE ONE STAR RATINGS ARE NOT KEWL AND SHUD GO TO THERE MOMMYS AND LISIN TO BACKSTREET BOYS
2,Ears are bleeding.....,"There are 4 words that describe this album; hard, hard, hard, and hard but is it good? These guys have an ok sound but come on they have 9 ... people couldn't they possibly create something more creative? It is a good thrashing album but every song is ""f' this"" and ""f' that"", ""I'm insane and psycho"", ""I'll kill you all "", ""I can't take much more ""(even though I have a feeling that 3 albums later they'll still be taking more)blah blah bland."
3,Only Slipknot album thats worth buying..,Slipknot is so over hyped. They're good and have talent but it's amazing how much recongnition they've got. Not to mention the costume and mask thing is pretty old now too. They're like Marilyn Manson.. decent music made ridculously popular by a gimmick. Anyway like I said this is easily their best and probably always will be.
3,Slipsnot!!!,"Hey, if u dont like these masked nobs then go track down Richard Cheese's version of People equals s***. Not to be missed."
1,"The best CD to scare my parents, and teachers with!!!","Slipknot is the best band to act like 9 overgrown 3 year olds, screaming like there is no tomorrow about very cool things like ""If you're a 555, then I'm a 666"" and ""People equal shxt"", screaming like their Mommies took away their toys and made them sit in time-out corner, not to mention run around on stage and beat eachother sensless with dead birds and dead goats heads while only 4 members are actually trying to play their instruments but fail to do so anyway. Yep...I can really relate to these cow pattie-shoveling Iowa goons who have nothing better to do then make songs about nothing but teen-angst, even if Korn did that 7 years ago...Yep Slipknot is really the most talented band I have heard since Milli Vanilli...all gimmick and no talent! ... Yep...Slipknot is the new band for us clueless, teen-angst filled fans of today! May the trendy bands keep on coming!"
2,Nothing like volume 3,"""If your 555 than im 6(sic)6!""Corey Taylor's macho voice booms.What were these guys doing? Half the songs on this CD are about the same overused themes that plague modern music. This is nothing like my favorite CD, Volume three, being so heavy it gets old real fast.Shocking to say that the only good song on this Cd ""Left Behind"" is one of the best ever on a cd filled with poor punchlines, bad vocals, machoish phrases, and everything rhymes (Which gets old very fast.) If you like Volume 3 then I can't promise enjoyment on Slipknot's earlier albums."
2,Crap,boring and not as cool as first release... thay have a self release floating around somewhere... i think they got the material for this cd from that i heard the self release and its way better than IOWA... i dont know... the arrangement of the songs suck
2,Too Heavy,"These guys are really bad at making heavy music. They could have stuck to their Nu-Metal filled Self Titled CD. I respect their descision for trying to get off MTV, and they did it well, but they really can't make good hardcore music. Face it people SLIPKNOT ARE NU-METAL. I don't like it when people call Slipknot Heavy Metal, it's wrong. Slayer, Chimaira, Superjoint Ritual...that's real, heavy, good music. I like some songs on Iowa, 'Gently' 'Everything Ends'...that's about it."
4,"It's better than their self-titled, but has weak parts","The songs ""skin ticket"" and ""heretic song"" are the worst on the CD, everything else is listenable, and ""People = S.h.i.t. has got to be the loudest track on the CD. Nothing much different than ""Slipknot"", just a bit louder. No ""Wait and Bleed""'s here."
1,Give me a break!,"Now, when I first heard wait and bleed, I thought, wow! What an awsome song. Slipknot also hit it great with songs like surfacing and spit it out. So naturally, I went right out and bought IOWA. What a mistake! Slipknot has absolutely no talent what so ever. They masked this fact in their self-titled album with some nice riffs and so-so lyrics. When you listen to IOWA, this reality is blown in your ears with moans, screams, and yelling. I know this is what metal is (and I love metal), but give me a break. If I could cut a cd by screaming and cussing into the microphone, I would, but I have integrity. Please, do yourself a favor, download ""people=...."" off the internet and buy a quality metal cd!"
1,One of the worst album I've ever heard,"The Drumming is the only saving grace, but Joey is wasting his talent. If you are a teenage suburban white male with a lot of anger then this may be for you, but it still sucks. This will sell to children throught lyrics alone, they are quite immature, usually about hating someone or something, or violence, or about evil or sometihn(""If your 555 then i'm 666..."" what is that supposed to mean?) Most kids will think its cool to evil like that, or will think they are hardcore since they haven't ever heard any real metal, jus limp bizkit. or perhaps they will think the masks make them a ""scary"" band to make their parents cringe. Well, one good thing about this album is that I know if I ever can't find a real job, I can get 8 of my friends, and yell and dance and beat the crap outa my instrument on a stage for a couple dollars."
1,Look at me I jump around in a clown suit and cuss!,"Why why why oh why isn't 0 stars an option? How stupid are all of you people? Any idiot can jump around in a clown suit screaming swear words at the top of his lungs for an entire album while 8 other people in clown suits bang on their instruments like a bunch of 2-year olds in the background....If this is supposed to be metal, take me back to the days when those little things like melody, lyrical content, and, oh yeah, the ability to SING meant something...Slipknot is just another manufactured fake-offensive crap metal collective, and it is a shame that so many young fans are being duped into listening to this crap...I would rather listen to nails on a chalkboard than submit myself to this vile, putrid mess of an album again....If this is the future of music, shoot me now"
2,just like the other.....,"if you really like TOTAL BRUTAL GUTURAL NU METAL with NO solos and a lot of roars and screams you may like slipknot...they actually got some good songs...i think they are like korn, with some good songs and A LOT of filler material....IOWA is a bit more polished than slipknot debut, but i actually think both SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME...all the lyrics are disturbing and not so brilliant and trully...the songs sound the same...if you want good BRUTAL METAL stuff try PANTERA, SEPULTURA, TESTAMENT, ANTHRAX, MACHINE HEAD, LAMB OF GOD or even old METALLICA...IOWA is just like the other, and it's not so good at all...."
4,IOWA = BETTER!,"This 2nd cd from Slipknot is a step in a different direction. Less grindcore/rap/breakbeat and more death and trash metal influences creep out on this one which makes for a brutally pleasent listening experience. I loved the 1st cd but ""Iowa"" is more up my alley. The songs flow better, the groove changes are just plain sic!! If you bought the 1st cd and liked it give this one a shot. But expect a darker, heavier, groovier listening experience."
3,S/T was better on many levels,Though this CD was much anticipated I was quite let down. At first it seemed like a good buy but soon after a few concentrated listenings it became redundant. Self-titled boasted a better display of talent and was a lot more fast-paced and energetic. This album seemed toned down and more focused on being bad then creating fast-paced high-energy music.
4,Solid Release,"I like this CD. I know there are people out there saying that Slipknot doesn't need nine members, or that they are talentless. I guess everyone's a critic. I have my beefs with this CD. One is about the lyrics. Corey sounds as if he pulled some scary, big words out of a dictionary to make him sound intelligent. Core, spare us the intellegent factor and just go back to what you do best: scream about how you hate everything. (not that I doubt that Corey isn't a smart guy, I'm sure he is. But using big words in place of something that requires, well, not big words, isn't needed). Anyway, besides that, this is a solid release by one of today's premier metal bands."
4,"I don't think Slipknot is ""Nu-Metal""","Lets be honest, Slipknot is a better band than most people give them credit for being, and Iowa is a great album. I mainly listen to grindcore/death metal bands like,(Hateplow, Cannibal Corpse, Strapping Young Lad), and I feel Slipknot belongs right there with the likes of Slayer, Cradle of Filth, and so on.... Iowa is pure hate, rage, and lots of other things death metal fans enjoy. Bottom line, if you like any kind of metal, buy this album, if you like Creed or Nsync, run....."
3,see them live,"Any Slipknot fan will tell you that these guys are awesome live. Their music comprises primarilly of loud noise and screaming, intended to induce headbanging and moshing at their shows. While this makes for a great concert-going experience, it does not necessarily make for a great music album. Ultimately, the listening experience becomes tiresome and repetitive; fans will love it, but if you're not a fan, this album won't make you one.Slipknot's combination of destructive instrumentals, harsh screaming mixed with singing and death-heavy lyrics sounds a lot like a much better (though lesser-known) band, Nothingface. If you like Slipknot, or like their kind of music, then you should probably check out Nothingface as well."
2,Sounds like a bunch of noise,"i would give slipknots first cd 4 stars, but iowa just doesn't sound that good to my ears. here are 3 reasons of why i do not care for this cd:1.) it's really heavy and sometimes just sounds like screaming and people banging on stuff2.) it's lacking melody3.) they have have 9 members and only need (use) 4 or 5. shawn, chris, sid, and espicially craig are members in the band who seem to do nothing.there are somes things that are good in this cd like joeys drumming, he's an amazing drummer and can use the double peddle faster than anyone i've seen. i would recommend this cd only if u are a big metal head and like music that just screams all the time."
4,i think the band overreacted,"great cd, it really is. but it does lack some of the innovation that was on their first cd. what i think basically happened is that they took comparisons to korn a little too seriously. that's why iowa is an almost all-out attempt by them to be as heavy as they think they can be. iowa is has some cool riffs and some awesome songs but i hope on their next cd, they'll include some of that cool atmospheric sounds found on the first album"
1,Slipknot = s**t,"Call it nu-metal, death-metal... whatever. But it still sucks. Why? For one, I listen to a CD to hear MUSIC, not the mindless ravings of the socially inept set to some rap-type beat. These guys really should look into some therapy, not put out pointless records. And it's not even HEAVY METAL! Hendrix, Cream, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC... that's some REAL metal. Hell, even the Beatles recorded heavier songs! (Helter Skelter would probably make Slipknot's heads explode, thus ridding us of one of rock's worst bands). And I'm not prejudiced toward any genre of music whatsoever- I listen to everything from John Coltrane to Otis Redding to the Beatles to AC/DC to Muddy Waters, so don't say it's because I'm ""Anti-metal"". I'm anti-Slipknot, that's all."
1,"Could I rated any lower, I really wish I could.","Oh my gosh.........this must be a joke.Have any of you stupid people who listen to this music actually read reviews of other people who can purley and plainly see that this is not music.its just a really big f*cken noise!For crying out loud, the think they're are all evil and scary but really they have no idea of making real music. I wonder if these [...] nerds have even sat down properly and listened to their records....and gone - actually this sounds like absolute sh*t. But we got rich of it - well who cares, ugh it just makes you sick!"
2,Hmmm...it is violent music i think,as i am not and expert in satanic Death-metal music i cannot tell many positive about slipknot.i heard their most popular tracks and it didn't sound like they are satanic and pure death-metal freaks.they are i tihnk.i bought it.i listened it one time.later i listened sometimes some good tracks from here.after about 3 days i put it on a shelf.Slipknot had put endless and awesome riff grooves behind the wall of fake satanistic lyrics (hahahahah) and big noise.Ross robinson (producer) could have done it better.1 star for cover.1 star for some catchy moments.rating - 2 stars (should be 1 and a half)
1,Generic death metal,"Unlike their debut album (filled with original music), Iowa sounds like every other death metal album I've ever heard. The songs blend together and become indistinguishable from each other, save by looking at the track number. It's really a shame that Slipknot chose to follow up one of the most influential metal albums of the past 10 years with one of the least. It seems that they have forgotten that good metal is about more then being really loud and really heavy. What's next? Adding umlauts to their name?"
1,death,why is the vocalists voice so loud. His lyrics make him seem like [upset] at the world but hes not screaming. its just the mic is on so high. If i want some real hatred i'll go listen to some ny hardcore thank you. ... These guys don't seem to have any talent. Slipknot is the defintion of numetal. Guitarists which dont know the music theory bassists which couldn't play chords so they started bass and drummers that play fast but dont have originality. They play all the same [material] as the other numetal bands. The only difference is the drummer plays double bass....
1,What's webster define music as again?,"Dictionary.com seems to think that the term music means: ""The art of arranging sounds in time so as to produce a continuous, unified, and evocative composition, as through melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.""I've never been one for the hardcore music like Korn and Disturbed as a lot of it seems like noise to me, though I can see reasons for people liking both. But sometimes bands cross the line, Slipknot seems to have ignored everything that defines music, and while that seems like a novel idea what the band comes down to is the same guitar riffs over and over again and something that sounds like someone knocking over a bunch of garbage cans in an alley.This is NOT music, if you want metal there's bound to be a band out there who delivers better than this."
1,Slipknot-Iowa,"Slayer is better, the Haunted is much better, Slipknot thinks they are heavy but Iowa is not as good as the first one, I returned my copy and exchanged it for Opeth. It's good, but from what I've read I was expecting a real metal album, not this."
1,GARBAGE,"I WISH YOU HAD ZERO STARS THIS CD IS JUST A BUNCH OF NOISE,THESE GUYS HAVE NO TALENT AND ITS A SHAME THAT THE YOUTH THINKS THIS MUSIC OR SO CALL MUSIC IS GOOD.GROUPS LIKE DISTURBED AND GODSMACK AND SEVENDUST SHOULD GET MORE CREDIT BECAUSE THEY ARE MUSICANS"
1,Wanna-be metal for kids who get picked on at school!,"Yes, i bet your asking ""why is this guy bashing nu metal!? when he should be bashing metalcore""I felt like being in a nu metal -hater mode so here goesbored last week....friend found this cd..... *laughed*.....listened to 30 seconds... shut it off.The end.Nu metal and slipknot suck."
1,slipkNOT metal,"1. 515- THE AREA CODE FOR S.H.I.T. TOWN2. SLIPKNOT = S.H.I.T (actually WOULD be a pretty good song, since its truthful and sincere)3-14. JUST GAYNOW ALL GOTHS GO CRY AND CUT YOURSELVES"
1,This is not heavy music.,"Lets get one thing straight; Slipknot. Is. Not. Heavy. Music. They simply aren't. They may think of themselves as heavy, but they're wrong. Screaming and playing loudly, does not make you heavy. Got that straight? Now on to the review.Slipknot's guitarists sound like rusty nails going through a wood chipper, and their DJ has absolutely no variety. The drummer is actually okay. He has some potential.The fact that it takes 9 people , to make music this bad, is emberrassing. Why do you need so many percussionists? And, a sampler? Couldn't the DJ just do that?"
1,"Very, very, very.....bad","I think this ""band"" ought to play the ""Stinkfest"" rather than the Ozzfest. We've all heard this before, and yet we are being led to believe that it is something ""groundbreaking"" and ""compelling."" Come on. The guitar riffs are not Slayer-inspired, they're Slayer rip-offs; there is a difference. The bass and drums rattle on all on their own, rather than providing a driving backbeat. And the lyrics, well, it's all contrived just to shock as many people as possible. If you're offended by this band, just ignore them. This band proves the utter banality of ""evil""."
4,good but not great,This cd was good. i liked some of the songs but i got kind of a headache at the end of the cd. i think this was better than slipknots first. but i think they could have done better.
4,KillerDrums,I just bought the new Slipknot CD yesterday. What a treat for a drummer. I've been playing drums for over 20 years and was blown away by the double-bass drum sound. The riffs are defintely there also. The best song is Everything Ends. The song may eventually end but Slipknot will gain many more fans with this one. People = S*** is also a strong song. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because there were quite a few songs that were a little too familiar to the first Slipknot CD. The last song on the CD called Iowa is about 15 minutes and is a treat for horror film fanatics. My recommendation is to buy it if you loved the first CD. I'm 43 and still rockin'
4,Pretty Good,"If Slipknot's objective on this CD was to create an overbearingly dark record, they succeeded. The musicis punctuated by guitars that are turned down in the mix, whereas the drums are turned way up. Corey's trademark screams are also present. This album suffers, like the last, from not spreading out there songs. All the good songs are in the beginning of the CD, while the rest of the CD is just....blah. Although hard, it fails to hold your attention like the beginning of it."
2,A big load of posers,"To think I used to love this CD. They copy Mushroomhead, who were wearing jumpsuits and masks 4 years before Slipknot formed with their OLD lineup, when they released MFKR. These guys have no talent! They beat the living [junk] out of their instruments and call it music. All Corey does is scream. These guys need to get some talent, right now, because this sounds like a car crash prolonged to last 60 minutes. If you want some really heavy music from a band with talent, get Mushroomhead's new CD, Xx, not this piece of [junk]."
5,Slipknot Rules All,"Slipknot is the heart and soul of hard rock. There is no other that can compare to the power and emotion of Corey, the lead singer. This CD, as well as Slipknot's previous album, helps me relax after a hard day. The only downside is that the CD starts out strong with the first few tracks, but starts to lose some of it's hardcore edge as the final tracks begin to play. But that's just my opinion. I say, buy this CD, you won't be sorry."
1,Terrible,Yet another metal band who has a contest to see who can play and scream the loudest.This album ain't worth a damn or even the 1 star I had to give it.
2,"ok you ""maggots""","first off, it you call people posers for not liking this stupid music you are a poser yourself. Slipknot is mainstream nu metal for all those 13 year old girls and 14 year old guys. It may be sort of decent but does even compare to any REAL metal band. Mick Thompson is on every BC Rich add and has his ads all over the music places i go. But is he even good? No, in fact, I could really write a better cd than this in a week. My old english teacher (40 year old guy) listens to Slipknot, guess that tells you how lame they are. If you want real metal go listen to Overkill, Testament, Kreator, and Exodus. They actually have talent."
1,Music for losers,"When this album first came out I was pretty skeptical about whether to get it or not. I'm always looking for different kinds of metal to listen to. I figured i'd give IOWA a shot. MAN DOES IT (...)! IT'S ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE!. Non talented nu metal. I don't even know why nu metal has the word metal in it. (...) bands like Poison or motley crue are more metal than slipknot. Give me a break. Slipknot needs 9 members to make it sound like they have 4 guys playing, thats how untalented they are. man I was upset after I had wasted my money on this CD. If you wanna hear REAL METAL listen to Death, Obituary, Slayer, Overkill, and so on..(...)"
1,SELL-OUT !,"plain and simple... they sold out. Slipknot's been 1 of my fave bands ever, till they released this one. that anger, rage that pumped up their sensational debut album, just were nowhere 2 b found on this one. this is one of the suckiest cd's i've ever listened to. it's too gimmicky and geared toward being commerciable. three words of advice--- DON't BUY IOWA."
1,Slipknot = s**t,"I remember a few years back I heard of this new freaky band called Slipknot with the song Wait and Bleed.I thought it was pretty good,so I bought their self-titled debut.I should have known better,because the album was horrible.Then I heard the single for their second album Iowa called Left Behind.I thought it was just awesome,so I gave these guys one more chance.Once again,I should have known better.This band is not talented,the only talent they have is the same talent Limp Bizkit has,which means,Slipknot has no talent.HAHA.Every song is nothing more than horrible corporate mall metal.Skip this band PLEASE!!!"
5,simply the heaviest metal today's money can buy,"With this fabulous release I can honestly say that slipknot, to me, is considered to be the heaviest band in the world no need for weak material from other less influential bands such as Extreme Noize Terror, Kreator, Gorgoroth, At the Gates, Dismember, Sodom, Nuclear Assault, or Deep Wound. Slipknot has it all from the best drumming to the most brutal vocals imaginable, giving Chris Barnes and Lord Worm a run for their money. Anyways this release is very intricate no pretty parts just straight forth to the subject matter and the grinding riffswhy need anything else? nu-metal has everything from rap drum beats (which by the way surpass jazz drumming by a long shot)and is pure genius by very talented artist. This band proves, with every release so far, that nine is better than three ::cough:: Nargaroth, Bathory, Destruction, Celtic Frost::cough:: We need more bands like this among others such as Korn and God Smack"
2,man this stuff is ok,"slipknot are a really ok band. There's nothing I enjoy more than locking myself in a dark cupboard, beating myself with a stick as I listen to Iowa. The problem with some people is that you are so narrow-minded that they refuse to dare to enlighten yourselves to the full range of sensations that is Slipknot. They rock so hard and bad that they make Bon Jovi look like your granny. Iowa kicks off at a sensational speed but unfortunately tends to lag towards the end. I think slipknot should stick to what they do best instead of lapsing into Gary Barlow territory."
3,New album? Old reviews?,"Why are the reviews I see for the original Iowa album? This is a new release, supposedly! Awesome album originally, haven't listened to the supposed new release. What happened to this band, seem to put out too many re-releases?"
3,Slipknot are NOT Death Metal... got it Alan Roach?,"....Now for the music... yes, it is heavy. Yes, it does make you bang your head. But... it sounds so much like the first one after they stated that it would be even more brutal than their first CD. Well... it isn't. After I read that in a magazine, I was kind of looking forward to hearing it. I mean they stated that they loved ""old school"" metal, such as Exodus, Slayer, and others. One even claimed that he was into Death Metal. But upon listening to this CD, I couldn't help but hear anything but a rehash of their first CD in disguise. I was hoping for an all out attack on my ears, but unfortunately did not get it. It's not a bad CD, but it isn't what they claimed it would be. I listen to it on occasion, but it certainly is not the album of the year. Later."
2,I guess it's fine.,"I just bought this CD 3 days ago. I sorta liked it at first, but i'm already tired of it. So tired of it. Some songs are filled with noise instead of actual riffs. And the songs don't sound very well organised. The guitars sound quite messy and weak. It isn't very heavy either, not that that's a bad thing. Not everything revolves around how heavy the music is, but i'm just saying that if you prefer heavy music over mellow music then this might not be the album for you. Although i must admit that Corey and Joey did a pretty good job on this album. And don't think that the reason i don't like this album is because they're mainstream. I couldn't care less if they're mainstream or underground, it does NOT change the music in any way."
1,The first CD was way better.,"While the first CD had some awesome songs with excellent parts for every insrtument, this CD just doesn't keep it going. I only have this CD to listen to the Drummer Joey because he is good. I suggest getting the selfnamed CD Slipknot, but do not get Iowa."
5,Iowa,"[...] Anyway this cd is very good which is way more extreme then there last. this is all screaming mostly the first song (515) is screaming just them going ""ugh"" in a yelling matter. the last song (Iowa) is 15 mins and 4 seconds long! it goes 3 minutes without saying 1 word!!!!!!this is a great cd but i would suggest that you buy the digi pack on there first cd because it is great and comes with 6 extra songs."
4,this is not death metal,"This is a pretty good cd, but get something straight here people: this is not death metal! Death metal has little to no melody at all, and i hear a lot of melody here. The first cd was pretty good and so is this one, and even though Slipknot may be influenced by death metal, this does not sound like death metal at all. Check out Dying Fetus, Nile, Cryptopsy, or Exhumed for death metal. Slipknot can't compete with these guys!"
5,Mantles wrong so screw him,MAmntle is wrong everyone likes slipknot...so what bout their parental advisory sign it's just their words they say.... everyone likes them any way even my dad.... So SCREW YOU MANTLE
2,NOT Heavy,"Reading all the reviews on here makes me laugh. Everyone seems to think this is a heavy album, well, maybe compared to Celine Dion it might be. But, if you like tough music without wussy ""singing"" parts, or parts in the middle of the song where they wuss out and use dumb sound effects, then check out Soilent Green. Maybe next time if Slipknot wrote an album that was heavy ALL the way through instead of just once and a while, I could've given it 5 stars."
3,so-so,the ring is beautiful and i've received tons of compliments for it but the gold wore off very quickly. i've only had it for 2 months and half of the gold is gone.
2,Wouldn't buy again,I'm sorry to say this ring looks better in the picture than in person. The gold tone is too bright and wore off quickly. It has a light weight to it.
1,Junk,The bag is extremely hard to put in. The latch broke to shut the unit broke. The bags are very hard to find in the stores must order on line.The suction power died after just a few uses. Do not buy this unit.
1,Waste of Money,Most cell phones have a better video camera than this piece of junk. If you want a digital camera spend a little more and get a good one. This camera has many issues with it's computer driver which creates problems trying to download the video to your comuter. No customer support to speak of. Don't waste your money.
5,Can't kill it,I have the key chuck version of this drill and can not kill it. I started out buying Craftsman power tools. A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away they used to know what quality was. No longer. Do not buy any power tools from Sears. They buy only on who can produce the cheapest tool for them and it shows. This Milwaukee will outlive 10 other drills. The keyless chuck only adds to the value.
3,Oh well.,"I am sure it's just me, but I was a little disappointed- if I wanted a copy of a Milwaukee, I would have bought a Makita. The chuck is cheesy (sorry) the cord seems borrowed from a cheap TV, the direction switch feels like it's gonna break each time I use it. Maybe the Milwaukee 3/8 I remember using a while back was an older model. I am sure the essential guts and geabox in this unit are still bulletproof, but the daily details have been neglected and it was this I noticed immediately and unrelentingly. So for another $30 or so I can buy a proper cord and a nice Jacobs chuck and have.. what?"
3,It will get hot!!!!,"A former Dewalt owner. The Milwaukee 3/8 is good drill. I'm going to ding it because after a short time using a grinder attachment to remove rust, the front metal housing gets HOT. The drill appears to be well built. Ready to take my abuse. Small normal drilling jobs will be no problem. But like I say, my drill usually take some serious abuse."
3,My new Milwaukee Drill.,"I bought this drill to replace a 3/8 Milwaukee drill I had for around thirty years that disappeared from my shop. The old one served well for the full time though I did need to replace the switch about 15 years ago. This new drill works well and seems to have a reasonable amount of torque, but it just doesn't have the solid feel of the old one. I also do not like the keyless chuck. It just doesn't have the feel of a quality item. They need to go back to Jacobs chucks. It will probably take years to know how the drill actually holds up, but after a couple weeks of using it it just isn't what i would expect from Milwaukee."
5,One of Fahey's most brilliant albums,"John Fahey recorded one free-form album. And this is it.Fare Forward Voyagers is Fahey's mystical album. It dives deep, and then swoops upward into complex reveries of cadences and rhythms. Although he occasionally anchors his compositions in delta blues hooks, the music pushes ever forward, as the title suggests.Fare Forward Voyagers is one of the most sophisticated acoustic guitar albums ever recorded. However, it didn't sell as well as Fahey's more accessible albums, and he never again revisited this approach.Fahey himself had warned against what he called ""orientalism."" And yet, here he is, flaunting his own rule. Again, according to Fahey, for the love of a Yogi's secretary.But don't let this endearing story distract from the intent of the compositions. This album is a serious excursion.If you are a Fahey follower, Fare Forward Voyagers is essential. If you are a guitar player or guitar music fan, it's a rare journey to the heights of solo acoustic guitar."
5,A wonderful album,"I've been listening to John Fahey for over 30 years and never tire of his music. This is my favourite. As others have mentioned, it was his most improvised album. Do yourself a favour and get it - you won't regret it!"
1,UN ESCRITOR CON POCO CONOCIMIENTO DEL TEMA,"quisiera referirme al epilogo la pagina 357 para ser exactos en esta pagina el escritor le llama a mexico un pais que tiene envidia a EEUU por sus logros.... y que por eso los mexicanos traficamos droga.para el escritor:By now everyone has accepted that the fact that as long as there's demand,there will always be supply, and that whenever one supplier goes down, another inevitably rises up to fill the void.SUPPLY AND DEMAND-the bedrock principle of economics- thus ensures that the endless war on drugs will continue until EEUU stop using drugs...si sabes tanto escritor porque ocultas la verdad?????. benjamin(sinaloense)"
4,Another strong entry in The Chronicles of Amber.,"...And on into the fourth book of The Chronicles of Amber. It's been a pleasant journey, as the series keeps getting better. (I started out not particularly liking the first book.) This is fun, escapist fare, chock full of melodrama, scheming, betrayal, and cliffhangers. What more could you want from this kind of read? There are some dry patches during which characters explicate at length -- too much telling, too little showing, as I used to hear in creative writing class. But then things pick up again, and by the time this book ends I'm yearning to pick up book five and find out what happens next!"
5,The Amber Chronicles,"This is the fourth book of the Amber Chronicles (the first one is Nine Princes in Amber). Get ready to read six more (Courts of Chaos, Trumps of Doom, Blood of Amber, Sign of Chaos, Knights of Shadows, Prince of Chaos) - you will not be able to stop!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The second Amber pentology is about Corwin's son, Merlin. He has been developing a reality altering computer named Ghostwheel, in Shadow, while living on Earth studying computing.King Random doesn't like the Ghostwheel develops meant, and orders it disabled, but Ghostwheel has other ideas, as do enemies of Merlin."
5,Brand New,"I was well pleased with what I got, especially for the price. The CD was still wrapped up, BRAND NEW."
3,pretty good disc,"the King of R&B represents here with ""Don't let go"". R.Kelly has another Good song. the Brother will have another big year. 2 Decades Deep&He can't be stopped Musically. elsewhere Brian Mcknight represents with ""I Believe"". for me over the past Decade&Change Kelly&Mcknight are the best two Cats in Modern R&B. if they ever did a whole Project together then they would shut down the Industry. they each got Crazy Skills. the rest of the tracks are just kinda there."
2,Where is the song???,"In the scene where they at the Blues Club when she ask him to dance, there is a song playing and I think it is ""Me'shell Ndegeocello"", why is that song NOT on the OST??????? Does anyone know the song???? Why are always the GOOD Songs missing!!!! THAT SONG MADE THE MOVIE not Whitney!!!!!!!!"
3,Missing Song,"The song sing by Lavon Davis ""Silly games Blues"" is missing from the soundtrack. Every song played in the movie should be on the soundtrack, I'm very disappointed. This is the song played in the scene where he takes her out for her birthday at juke club.RoyPalmdale,California"
5,Nice,This is a very relaxing cd. I love the songs and this is a great traveling cd. I have had to make a copy for my friends.
2,Made my dog sick,I only used this product for 2 days. I gave it to both of my dogs (yorkie & chihuahua) and it gave my yorkie immediate diarrhea. I didn't make the connection until the second day when it happened again right after he ate it. My chihuahua didn't seem to have this problem but she did have to go a lot more in the past 2 days. I returned this and ordered berry blend which was suggested by an organic nutritionist.
1,I had high hopes but.....,"It didn't work ;-( my pet Molly has been on this for about a month and to be honest there was no change. Molly is also on antibiotics to help with the UTI she has but I thought the Cranberry relief would aid in helping her as well... Needless to say, Molly had to go back on antibiotics because the natural way just wasn't working. I had high hopes but I may try the capsules instead. She did have better results when I did 2 full capsules a day in the human form."
2,Cranberry relief,"This was strongly recommended to me by a breeder but I think, but cannot prove, that it gave only slight relief to urinary incontinence for the large schnauxer."
2,"Arrived with no seal, no scoop","When I got home from work today I opened the box and the jar had no seal on it, and there was no scoop inside the jar. I would have had to ship it back today to get a replacement and UPS was already closed (I work until 9pm) so I just opted for a refund. Im not sure why Amazon insisted that I return the item the same day it arrived. Since the product wasn't sealed, I don't want to give it to my pets - plus the dosing instructions are by scoop, and without a scoop I have no idea how much to give anyway."
4,great product,My dog is prone to UTIs so I use this product as a preventative measure. Its been several months since her last one..so far so good! I just wish it came in larger quantities.
5,A must have for K9 bladder infections!!,"I have a 10yr old lab female and a 7yr old female shih tzu who WERE constantly getting bladder infections. I've spent hundreds if not thousands on vet bills and extremely expensive antibiotics ($10.00 a pill) to help clear the infections which would return after a few months. I decided to research holistic remedies and stumbled upon this MIRACLE CURE by accident. This product has been a life saver for both my dogs I initially followed the directions exactly on the package and the bladder infection cleared up within three days, after that you are supposed to just give it to them a couple times a week but I give both my dogs the recommended dose once a day every day and the bladder infections haven't returned (knock on wood). I highly recommend you give this product a try, your dogs will thank you and you will have the peace of mind knowing that they are not in pain!"
3,Hoped it would work....,"I purchased this because my 6 year old male cat has had recurring UTI's for almost a year and I was at my wit's end, emotionally and financially. After reading all of the positive reviews, I thought I would give it a try. My finicky guy would not touch it. I tried mixing it in his wet food, and bought some new wet foods to see if new flavors would entice him, but he turned his nose up at it every day that I tried. I gave it 3 stars because it seems like an affordable, natural and effective way to treat the issue...if your pet will consume it. My guy also has to take 1/2 tab of prednisilone every day so he sometimes gets food-avoidant if he thinks I am slipping anything into his dinner. He has responded better to PetAlive UTI-Free, which is more costly but MUCH less than a few hundred bucks every 4-6 weeks at the vet!"
3,The Maldonado Miracle,"A good first attempt at directing from Salma Hayek. I look forward to her next film with great anticipation. This, film, however has some tough boots to fill if you compare it against other ""miracle"" movies - namely, ""The Miracle of Marcelino"" or ""Marcelino Pan Y Vino"" which to me is still the best. Also, Peter Fonda, while believable as the small town priest, fails to put enough emotion in the roll (at times) which seems to keep the movie down in some parts. Luckily, Ruben Blades and Mare Winningham give great performances and keep you interested in the film's final outcome. Again, for a first attempt, Salma has shown that women can make excellent directors! My final opinion for this movie? It's a nice rental for you and the family though I doubt many of you will add it to your DVD collections - but keep in mind that my opinion has been tainted by viewing other movies like ""Marcelino""."
5,This Tender Miracle Comes with Common Touches..,"My wife and I watch wide varieties of epic drama, humor, musical and far too many violent dramas like Braveheart! This simple but profound story based upon the 12 yr old Mexican lad is greatly contrasted with all the others yet soon reaches out to tug at the heart! Peter Fonda is the cooler counter-part for his sister Jane. Yet so keenly fitted as the low-key Catholic Priest and care-giver for young Jose` who slowly encounters a Helper for his dog and himself! I thought Ruben Blades and Mare Winningham were great drama fill-ins for contrasting their fascinating stories alongside the Latino flavor of Jose. What a wonderfully spinning out of this simple but beautiful ending surprisingly wrapped-up for Mystery. We were Awed with Salma Hayek as first-time Director! Another Big Plus for retiree Chaplain Fred W Hood"
5,Just Like Being There!!!,Saosin is one of the best upcoming bands out right now. I've seen them live before and they have so much energy. This dvd makes you feel like your right there. The camera angles are fantastic (wish they would have showed Alex more but still outstanding). This is a great set for old and new Saosin fans because they play songs from their LP and some old songs from the TTN EP. Overall a great DVD/CD for the big fans like myself or a great pickup for new and upcoming fans out there.
1,Just a heads up..,"""August 01, 2004Liquid Creatine Manufacturer FinedMuscle Marketing USA (MMUSA), maker of the popular liquid creatine supplement ATP Advantage Creatine Serum, has been fined $70,000 US by an Auckland district court for violating the New Zealand Fair Trade Act. MMUSA is charged with making false representations about the effectiveness of its creatine serum and concentration levels contained in each bottle.

Creatine is known to be unstable in liquid form, but MMUSA has continued to market their product globally."""
1,she doesn't swing,Back in the 30's and 40's musicians had a word for a relaxed upbeat kind of music which they called swing. It moved off and on the beat but ended up hitting the bar line every 8 or 16 beats at least. The hallmark was that nothing clashed. Nancy is not without talent but she does not know how to swing. She holds a note long after the orchestra has moved on and misses some of those all important bar lines. She doesn't make your body move or make you want to dance. Not a bad voice but she just doesn't know how to swing. She beeps when she should bop.
1,Poor quality and run BIG!,"Very thin, no tummy control at ALL. Lace is ""itchy""and the worst part is they run WAY to big!Size 5 is more like size 7!"
3,sizes run small,I ordered these in a size 7 1/2 (which is usually a very good fit for me) but the fit was more like a size 7 and I couldn't wear them.
5,"THE UNTOUCHABLES-SEASON 1, VOL 1","Very efficient seller, fast shipping, fair price. Excellent item, good quality. Will buy from again."
2,Rediculous price,I agree with those who complain about the 1/2 season sets. This is pure greed. Luckily I found this set at Walmart for $19.99. Otherwise I would not have bought it.
5,This set is not Untouchable,"Another classic tv series that is so long overdue. Robert Stack is great as the leader of the band of G-men known as the ""Untouchables"". The documentary style and opening narrations by Walter Winchell are just fantastic. These are stories of good guy versus bad guy. So what if in reality it was not Elliot Ness who got Capone. This was a time of machine guns, speakeasies and of course dames. This was a lot of fun to watch back in the day, when my parents would let me stay up that late, or when I could sneak an episode. True, it might be mild by todays standards but it is still very entertaining."
4,Classic Series /Poor Packaging,"Earlier this week, I received my long-awaited dvd set of ""The Untouchables"" volume 1 of the classic TV series starring Robert Stack as Elliot Ness. I am amazed at how well this series has held up over the many decades since it was originally broadcast. The picture and sound is excellent. However, the packaging is flimsy (clear plastic case) and the disc holders do not hold the discs in place. While the two-hour series premier is included and is certainly a bonus, it is disappointing that no other features or background information is included. Truly, the Untouchables is deserving of a much more distinguished presentation."
1,Kiss Of Death,"Upset about how expensive it is to buy this great old tv show that has been chopped up into two volumes for each season? Well here's another reason to lament. I bought Season 1, Vol.1 and discovered that it has picture freezes which are so bad that a major portion of each episode has to be skipped in order to continue. This is a common problem with poorly manufactured dvd sets but I was surprised to see it here because they didn't make the mistake of using both sides of the disk. But even so they still managed to produce a defective product. This to me is the kiss of death for any dvd production. Back to the drawing board Paramount!"
2,No Nitti,"If you're a true fan of the Untouchables you'll know that the release of only half of the show's first season by Paramount is nothing but a cruel joke on those who've long awaited the DVD release of this classic series. Only ONE of these episodes contains the legendary Bruce Gordon as Frank ""the Enforcer"" Nitti, the Untouchables' greatest foe. Paramount should be ashamed. Fans of the Untouchables should demand better."
5,Take care of business,"The untouchables are one of the great true story crime shows they have. They are great stories. And this is worth collecting alot about gansters,and how the made money from bootlegging, gambling, hitmen, everything."
3,EDDIE WAS A DECENT GUY UNTIL BUGSY MORANE'S GOONS TURNED THE CHOPPER ON HIM!!!,"This series is like a whole season's worth of the Star Trek episode ""Piece of the Action"". I remember this show well because as a kid I used to go to bed around the time it was on. I was surprised to see Desi Arnez produced it (and provided the intro). The acting is cartoonish and superficial and Robert Stack now looks the same as he did then (what's up with this!!). However, I prefer this series over the current crop of detective stories because now every series portrays the government as evil (liberal Hollywood syndrome). For pure escapist adventure check this series out (worth it for the 1930 era cars alone). AND...love the narrator's voice (brings back memories). Check out Robert Stack BEFORE his role in Airplane!! Lock and load!!"
3,Tooooo Long,"The historical fiction is plugged into the plot like a cork being forced back in to a champaign bottle. It just doesn't work. This novel would have done well at 300 pages, but at over 700 you just cannot wait for the silly ending so you can read something else. The Da Vinci Code had a believeable story interwoven with history. This has history jammed into a useless story that screams, ""Look what I just learned about New York in 1890. I guess I'll put it here."" Give me a break. If you want a good mystery novel about New York read Mickey Spillane. At least you care about those those characters."
4,How is your staying power?,One really needs staying the course capabilities to read entirely through this book. It also gets a bit gritty. But if you like a lot of reality in you mystery reading this is indeed the book for you.
1,"Disturbing, boring","For me, this book was unfinishable. I got about 100 pages in and just couldn't read any more. And that's a rarity for me. I typically read 30-40 novels a year, and this is one of only 2-3 in the last 10 years I can recall not wanting to finish.Mostly I found the author to be longwinded and boring. That alone I could have survived. But, combine a boring style with gruesome descriptions of a murdered child, and I just thought I had better things to do with my time than finish this."
1,This book is deadly dull.,"The Alienist is simply a revision of his earlier novel - The Angel of Darkness. Once again, we learn about the early days of detection and criminology. The characters are almost all the same and exceptionally wooden in their dialogue. They are so earnest and so clever you ache to hurt them. To spice up his revision Carr adds luckless, pathetic, supposedly endearing prostitutes and thieves. They are no more than regurgitations of characters from thousands of other mysteries. I was so bored, I couldn't finish it. I happened to see someone purchase it and I felt ashamed that I didn't warn him."
5,the Alienist,I absolutely loved this book... it kept me in suspense up until the last page.....Will we see more of these sleuths?????
1,"Started good, ended boring","I was convinced to buy this book (big mistake) by the cool, mysterious, photograph on the cover and by the huge words ""..New York Times Best Seller List..."" along the cover. The first few chapters were ok I guess, I was hanging in there hoping for something more. I read each chapter, hoping for some substance to be added, only to be disappointed each time. I have to agree with a lot of people that the characters are sooo DULL and unbelieveable. I didn't care at all about any of the characters. By the time I finished it, I didn't care who lived or died. I just wanted to finish the damn thing then throw it away."
4,Amazing and Engaging Read,"Wow. What a read. I don't think I've gone through 600 pages faster than I did with ""Alienst"" over the past week. The story is exciting. The writing is vivid. And the characters are interesting.Think of this as CSI - New York - 1896. The story: a turn of the century psychologist, a crime reporter, Theodore Roosevelt, and a few other detectives and support staff search for a serial killer who's horribly butchering children in New York City.There are virtually no lulls in the story, as author Carr drops clue after clue, and slowly builds up an empirical profile of the mysterious killer. There are no obvious points to put the book down and take a breather, as I continuously found myself staying up later and later following each new lead and discovery.The book is a bit gory. There's nothing held back in the details of bloody murders, and reflections on stories of abuse. If you're able to accept this level of realism, then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book."
4,Carr creates gripping and engaging tale,"Laszlo Kreizler is an American version of Sherlock Holmes who, in the setting of New York City of the late 1800's, attempts to solve the murders of children. Kreizler and his cohorts use methods unheard of at the time as they endanger their careers and lives to find the culprit.I found the characters engaging and the plot gripping. I couldn't wait to see who the killer was. I enjoy stories with a group of well defined characters -- but not too many so that I lose track -- and Carr succeeds in creating that."
4,1890s Manhattan with a killer on the loose...,"'The Alienist' is a very good blend of history and criminal fiction. It deftly chronicles life in 1890s New York City whilst several characters, with guest appearances from the then police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt, track down a psychotic killer/cannibal. Caleb Carr truly succeeds in capturing the feel of a bygone New York; I found it to be wonderful escapism. However the murder mystery itself, while often very clever and unpredictable, stretches credibility - the author overcooked it a bit.Bottom line: a well-written mystery for fans of old New York. Recommended."
4,Not a fan of the era but this book is great,"I tend not to enjoy books, fiction, non-fiction or fiction based on non-fiction on this era in American history but this book is extraordinary. Carr does an exemplary job of portraying the darkness of NY and the tenements and despair being a very effective backdrop for this equally dark story. Carr is a master of good old fashioned mystery, using real characters and real landmarks that makes this book all the more effective.This is one of the reasons I enjoyed The Anatomy of Deception by Goldstone. The two are similar although, Carr is much more effective.While The Anatomy of Deception uses characters not as well known to the reader, a little research of those characters history will no doubt make The Anatomy of Deception a good read for those who enjoyed the Alienist.The Alienist is a very good book and I enjoyed it immensely."
4,THE FIRST SERIAL KILLERS HUNTERS,"I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK AS IT IS BASED ON THE TRUE NEW YORK BACK IN THE 1800'S AND WHAT IT WAS REALLY LIKE. HOWEVER, IT DOES TAKE TIME TO GET INTO THE BOOK AS THE FIRST 100 OR SO PAGES ARE BORING AND I FOUND MYSELF HAVING TO LOOK UP ALMOST EVERY OTHER WORDS IN A DICTIONARY TO GET THEIR MEANING. BUT ONCE YOU BREAK THROUGH ALL THAT, IT IS A FASCINATING INSIGHT INTO THE SERIAL KILLERS MIND AND THE WAY THE FIRST GROUP OF ALIENISTS CAUGHT THEM!"
2,Have you ever consumed an entire pack of American Cheese?,"It isn't enjoyable, but some inner compulsion drives you to tear through the whole packet. When you've finished you feel slightly quesy and have a greasy gloss on your skin. This, in brief, is the experience of reading Carr's Alienist. The historical detail of 1896 New York and the enigma of a tot-dicing psycho lead to a tangy first few chapters, but eventually Carr's bland plotting and truly dreadful prose leave a reader gagging on the latest offering of Kraft presliced serial killer fiction."
2,"Couldn't finish it - Weak, Sherlock Holmes rehash","I had a lot of high hopes for this book. But Icouldn't even finish it. The end of each chapterhas the incredibly passive main protagonist being""jerked"" into the next chapter's so-called ""adventure"".Portraying a historically accurate setting is one thing, but developing characters of depth and creating a truly suspenseful plot is another. I cannot believe how people have fawned over this book.Conan Doyle, this guy ain't."
4,One of his first noticed works,"I read this when I was still living in NYC and found all the descriptive rants, up and down familiar streets, etc. perfect! I hadn't really thought about NYC before running water and subways and forensic science--or without a established Brooklyn Bridge. I loved the way he wound the central story (the tracking down of the murder) with the variety of people the doctor associated with (rare for that time for an upper classman to even talk to anyone lower class, let alone care about them or take them into their house). This book was like opening a box of chocolates to have all to yourself in front of a good fire in the fireplace on a rainy dreary night. I had such hopes for Carr but his subsequent books haven't lived up to this one. 4 stars only because the story isn't one I would reread (I don't general reread mysteries) or wouldn't feel I had to keep a copy in my library but have given copies to friends/family and recommend it to anyone into period murder mysteries."
4,Raging Roosevelt Meets Freud,"The Alienist is probably about 100 pages too long, yet nonetheliss quite thrilling. It is not really a mystery, more a study in morbid psychology. Its characters are varied, from Theodore Roosevelt down to the boy-whore rapist and killer. Some of the details seem anachronistic to me, more what New York was like some twenty years earlier. Overall, if you like gory thrillers thick with atmosphere and with splendid character development, this is a book you will want to read more than once."
4,The Alienist,"Great historical information and fascinating characters. Learned a lot about early psychology and Theodore Roosevelt.If I have a criticism, it is that the book is too long and that that it could have been shortened by eliminating some material.. material.."
4,"Alienist is disturbing, literate, with historic value","The chief value of this book is the most excellent job the author has done in detailing life in 1890s NYC, from the parlors of a robber baron to the sleazy nightclubs which operate in a world of corruption and organized crime. The media get a beating, although a journalist is a main protagonist. There is a preoccupation with food and fine dining, which reminded me of Mann's ""The Magic Mountain"". The plot is sensational and gory, but well within bounds of reality(re: Ripper, Jack). The references to contemporary figures such as Freud and TDR ring true. There is so much psychological trauma and violence that at the end the story bows from its own weight. Still, this is a well-written shocker which compares favorably to anything by Stephen King or Patricia Cornwell."
4,"Good, but not thrilling enough","Set at the end of the 19th century in New York City and with a dark, gloomy Edgar Allan Poe savor, this original novel approaches the crime genre from another angle, profiling, that is, getting into the mind of a serial murderer, step by step through forensic deductive sciences and psychological insights arising from the knowledge and technology available at that time. The plot featured as a blend of historical fiction and psychological thriller, it is well constructed, but it goes at a very slow pace sometimes with very tedious pitfallings. Though in general has a fair resolution, the events that give way to the definition suddenly speed up too much in relation to the very long slow prior structure of the plot, subtly tarnishing the quality of the story overall. Deep and complex requires concentration and patience"
3,Intelligent but ending anti-climatic.,"Living in NY, I enjoyed reading about the ""old NY"" of Teddy Roosevelt; it was very well researched. Story was very intelligent and the entire book was written to reach conclusion which, I thought, was anti-climatic. The book is too long to sustain the excitement to the finish."
4,"Interesting, But Not Compelling","A criminal psychiatrist attempts to solve a series of murders by using criminal profiling techniques popularized by FBI profilers.Horrific crimes are committed against young male prostitutes, which have received scant attention in the press. NY City's police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, decides to look to two of his Harvard buddies to crack the case.There are too many subplots going on which detract from the story. Why so many different factions are opposed to this novel approach isn't clear. Everyone from gangsters, to former cops to puritanical censors, even JP Morgan, has something to say about the unorthodox approach being used.A good editor could have made this a fascinating case study."
3,"Great promise, but weakens about halfway...","No need to add much to the cacophony on this one, other than to comment that the excitement generated in the reader by the attention to detail and character development in the first half of the book is matched only by the growing disappointment as the story bogs down in the second half enroute to a lame ending. Oh well. Worth reading, just."
1,"Nice history lesson, weak characters, artificial dialog.","Thank God I don't live in John Moore's (main character) world and have to listen to people talk this way all the time. I'd be nuts in about three days. This book needs some real people in it. PLOP! That was the sound of ""The Alienist"" hitting the circular file"
1,Glad I didn't buy hardback,"I hate wasting money on things that disappoint me. But in this case at least I didn't waste money on the hardback edition (I bought Kindle edition). Never one to jump on the so-called ""New York Times Best Seller"" (this is a good example of why) bandwagon, this book is a total loser--and I barely got into it. It's boring. Doesn't move. Too much pontificating (Hmmm? Could Caleb Carr be a politician: A person who talks a lot and says nothing?) I much agree with those who gave it one star. Those that went as high as two stars were being generous. Although I've put it in my Kindle archives, unless I find myself absolutely without anything more interesting to read I seriously doubt it will remain there as a potential read. How is it stuff like this gets published? Kindle should offer this turkey as a freebie...even at that it would be overpriced."
1,Another no,"I agree with ""Engish Teacher""( I am one) that this story is flat and wordy.I was attracted by the hisory and the period. What a let down!Ugh! Life is too short for such lifeless writing. I'm sure it will be a fine movie."
3,Couldn't put it down!,"This was one of our book club's selection and although I wasn't excited that we were reading it I just couldn't put it down! Well written, certainly compelling but very grisly. Our book club discussion also touched on the female detective on the NYPD back in a time when that was quite unusual."
1,A choking morass of dull detail and flat characterization...,"I took the time to peruse most of the other reviews before I wrote mine. There are a lot of people who love this book. Okay. I won't criticize this. However, I was only able to perservere for about a hundred excrutiating pages, decided to skip to the tedious predictable ending and see what happened, then rushed that sucker back to the library furiously pleased that I hadn't spent hard currency on such dishwater. As dull a mystery, as boring a lump of historical detail, as paper-thin a job of characterization as I have ever seen in a best seller. Two questions remain: ""How?"" and ""Why?"""
5,GREAT BOOK !,LOVED LOVED LOVED ! I had to read this book for my history class and I just couldn't put it down. It's very descriptive and vivid.
4,Great mystery,I read this book for a class in college and it's probably the most entertaining book I've been forced to read. I enjoyed the way the murderer was identified by putting together little bits of information and by psychological deductions. It's a thrilling tale and a fabulous mystery full of historical detail.I found the descriptions of the murders quite graphic and horrifying so just beware. It's been a couple of years since I read the book and I'm still disturbed by parts of it.
5,Great read,"This is a well written, well researched historical novel. Had a very difficult time putting the book down. Looking forward to read more of the adventures Dr.Laslo Kreizler has."
2,Seemed like a good idea at the time ...,"once upon a time I was in a large bookstore and after some poking around, I stumbled upon this book's front cover-I perused the back cover as well as some of its innards and was intrigued. However, after several nights of what can best be decscribed as highschool homework-forced reading, I had to abandon this book. TOO CONTRIVED. How fortunate that Kreizler (sp ?) was able to come up with the whole suspect-profile? Then again, Delmonico's seems like a swell place to eat."
5,Exceptional for an early century story,"I've never really been into period writings, but I really enjoyed this adventure. I was on pins and needles until the culprit was caught. The groups' different personalities added to my enjoyment. Caleb Carr makes some very poignant quotes in this novem that he attributes to Roosevelt. I'm not sure who really said them but they were very memorable. You simply have to read this novel."
5,I normally don't like historical novels....,"... but Caleb Carr's The Alienist is, simply put, one of the most entertaining, provocative books I've read. There are plenty of reviews discussing the murders and the style... What shines here is Carr's ability to take us to the first true American investigation into a new type of criminal: a serial killer. The average person in the late '90's is so well versed in modern investigative methods, to the point of being bored. This novel takes those readers back to the late EIGHTEEN-90's, for a glimpse of a renegade investigation fighting time and all powers that be, with 'experimental' methods such as fingerprinting and profiling. Add to this unique viewpoint a few well-written characters, a historian's accurate depiction of 19th Century New York, and a thankfully intelligent narrator (Kay Scarpetta be damned, I say...), and you've got a damn fine read. Caleb Carr, you've done a fine job, and I salute you."
3,Good read which is disturbing to the bitter end...,There were many things in Caleb Carr's novel which made this book a good read but his sympathetic approach to the killer and his sadistic interpretation of the alienist take it one step further than I was expecting to go. By the end you wonder if the Alienist is worst than the killer and you actually cannot see a distinction between the two.
3,596 pages of book.550 pages of great reading..,"This book kept my intrest on the first 550 pages,but was totally dissapointed with the ending..It lacked the luster that the whole book built you up for..Seemed to me that Carr just got tired of writting and jotted down the first ending he came up with,without even giving it the thought that the rest of the book had..Yet,because this book is so gripping and intresting,in its first 550 pages,it should not be past over by anyone who likes crime/thriller books...."
3,Late 1800's psychological mystery,"Not really my cup of tea. Guess I like more action in current times. But if you like piecing together muders through psychology then you will probably enjoy this. It was interesting to see Theodore Roosevelt in action. I didn't like the references to future events not related to the story, such as the comments about T.R. beign president. I think the author should stick to the story at hand."
4,GREAT!!,"A friend loaned me the book. It was so intense, I bought a copy of my own to read it again. Since then, I have loaned it out 4 times and they've bought copies of thier own. The detail was amazing and brought out aspects of investations back then that I never would have thought about. READ IT!!"
4,Historical Fiction that Almost Delivers,"Caleb Carr did a wonderful job of incorporating historical characters (JP Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt) into his novel about a turn-of-the-century serial killer and its pursuers. I would have rated this book a ten had it not been for the farfetched Hollywoodesque climax. Still, I recommend this book to readers of all genres."
5,Take a couple of days off work before you start this one.,"Fascinating tale of murder, politics, and history. Even though I also feel that chracter development was somewhat scant, I feel the style of the narrator tends to mitigate this, although maybe only a little. I also thought the killer was actually a little too wimpish in the end - kind of anti-climactic. But if you enjoy historical fiction, and you enjoy a good solid thiniking who-dunit, this is a book for you. This was a time when forensic psychology was practially non-existent, and the labors of these characters in applying psychology to their chase of this serial killer can be educating as well as enthralling. You get so caught up in the tale, you can almost ignore the rather flat characters."
5,A great read...,"This book was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The way Carr details the way New York was 100 years ago is so exacting it seems to take the reader there.Carr has drawn his characters with a depth and a sincerity rarely seen in todays novel's of this type. Since they usually concentrate on the more gory aspects of the crime and not they way it was commited, The Alienist is a book that does not demean the readers intelligence with cheap explanations and answers that come to the characters all to easy.Simply put one the best books that I have ever read. Very well written, extremely intelligent, and well planned and thought out. A page turner wihtout peer. (with the exeception of The Silence of the Lambs of course *grin*)"
2,The alienist :a novel(Dr.lazlo kreizler),Different than what I expected. Couldn't put it down when I started. Very good story and will try to find more books by this author
5,The Alienist,Exceedingly well written and a very graphic description of life in turn of the century NYC. And a very fast paced drama.
3,"""Organized Criminals Featured""","The basic appeal of the novel was driven by the historical development of the use of forensics in solving crimes. The development of both a physical and psychological profile of the killer as a new tool in forensics made this novel different. The role of the organized criminals, however, was a distraction in the plot. It seemed there were too many rival gangs."
3,"Poor, predictable","The novel has all the topics of the stories of serial murderers. The characters are poor, as taken from a television series (bad). Predictable from the beginning to the end, although it seems well documented on the New York of the late nineteenth century."
4,The Alienist,Interesting book to read--a fun perspective about the beginnings of profiling to solve crimes. It's a smart book with lots to think about as you hurtle through the adventure. The book came quickly and was cheaper than buying it for a Kindle...much cheaper.
3,"Interesting, but....","A very interesting novel, but the writing was remarkably stiff. Despite a wealth of detail, the characters and settings failed to come alive (in *this* reader's imagination, anyway). I may try ""Angel of Darkness"" nonetheless."
2,SUCKED,"This book sucked. The style was unrhythmical, boring and academic. The plot was interesting, filled with interesting scenarios but the ending was a complete disappointment. This is the worst ending of all novels I had read. It started from being a murder horror suspense novel to a cliched mob shootout ending. Actually there was really no ending. The novel just stopped."
2,Caleb Carr's plodding plot mars mystery,"This is the second Caleb Carr book I've read and it will be the last. Carr follows Charles Dickens in the tradition of using 100 words to say what 15 could have said.The plot is slow to develop. Carr sacrifices reader interest for the sake of creating mood. He succeeds in doing both - mood is created and I nearly lost interest. I forced my self to move on, suck it up and finish and I was rewarded with a decent last 100 pages or so. But, the payoff was not early enough for all the build-up.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone except for the most hardcore fans of mystery and/or New York City."
3,I expected so much more....,"I don't really understand why so many people seemed to think this book is extremely well written. It didn't really strike me as anything all that special in the writing department. Concerning the story itself, it lacks any tension or suspense. If found myself not really caring who the killer was... I found it to be emotionally flat. The author clearly knows what New York was like during the time period he writes about, but I thought he put a little too much time and emphasis describing the setting. After a certain point, I really thought that he was trying too hard to show us how much he knew about what stores and restaraunts were around back then. I wished he had spent more time developing the suspense. This is one of the few murder mysteries I've read that took me more than a week to finish; I just kept putting it down because of lack of interest."
2,Flat,"Look, I'm seriously in the minority here. But, I think that the writing is flat and dull and that the whole book is tedious. It's at least 200 pages too long. There is some excitement in the final 150 pages, but the payoff is limited at best. Its good points include describing turn of the century NYC in a way that makes life today seem glorious and hopeful. We've come a long way, and Carr does a good job making that clear. But, narrator Moore is a bore; the interesting characters --Cyrus, Stevie, the two detective brothers, Mary--are given short shrift; there is almost no spark between the characters at all.Carr is a terrific essayist and letter writer. Is that his real gift? To find out, I'd have to read a second novel and I don't know that I'm willing to do that."
2,"At times good, but often dull, confused, never riveting",I'd heard good things about this novel so perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. But I finished it disappointed. A good editor perhaps could have fixed this novel. At times it's laboriously slow and wastes time. The author's skill for setting and description can't make up for his short comings building a tight story.I thought it was interesting when they analyzed a letter from the killer. I liked a lot of the description of New York City at that time. I liked a trip to a small rural Massachusetts town to interview the killer's brother.I found Theodore Roosevelt's character annoying and added nothing. We have shadowy characters trying to interfere with the investigation for no particular reason.Just expected more than I got.
3,Hi Mr. Steigleder,"The Alienist written by Caleb Carr takes place in New York in the late 1800s. It is about a group of about six people, including one woman who try to solve a serial murder case. This serial murders name is Japeth Dury in early life and is later changed to John Beecham. He had been kiling for some time but lately had been killing young boy whores. The process was long but the members of the secret team, out to get Dury, eventually Caught him during the act. At this time the murderer was accidentally killed. This killing made Kreizler, a member of the secret team, angry because he wanted to research the man's thinking behing his murders."
3,An interesting but unsatisfying book.,Written in an interesting method. Killer is not met until near the end of the book but the reader gets to know him through earlier discoveries and evidence. Outside of the book's structure the writing is terrible and the characters cringingly stereotypical. An interesting but unsatisfying book. Some examples of writing so bad they caused my wife and I to laugh out loud. Also offensive view of poor (i.e. low class) people. Some positives are it's organization and the obvious amount of historical research that went into it's writing.
4,"Sometimes fascinating, sometimes slow as glacial ice","This book, i.e., its author, succeeds in doing three things: transporting the reader vividly back to New York City just before the turn-of-the-century, revealing the fact that serial killers are nothing new and captivating the reader during the last 150 pages. It was a good read (not great), that provided rich detail of NYC during the 1890s, along with explicit descriptions of the cruel manner in which the book's killer treated the victims. The story moved slowly and I found myself having to re-trace pages frequently in order to re-connect one event with a previous piece of information. I enjoyed the book and was anxious to find out who the villian (understated)was. But, I won't run out the door to pick up Carr's next one. I may walk however."
4,Slow at Parts but a good book,"I enjoyed this book and was very pleased with the climax and the ending. The last 150 pages fly-by. Unfortunately, many sections of this book drag on and on. The writing was fluent and descriptive and the relationship development between characters was superb. Although I enjoyed this book, I am not rushing to read Caleb's next book Angel of Darkness. It's a good Mystery/Thriller and I recommend you read it...when you get a chance."
5,The best crime story ever. Beats The Silence of Lambs.,"The Alienist is a absolutely enthralling book. Caleb Carr's research of early 1900s New York is flawless. His character description is vivid, and the actual mystery and how it is solved is magnificent. No doubt the best crime story I've ever read. This book has been compared to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. No way! This beats Thomas Harris's thriller page for page, no doubt about it. The description is more vivid, the research is much better, and the mystery is much more captivating. The only reason I give this book a 9 and not a 10 is because the beginning is a bit slow. Nevertheless, I applaud Mr. Carr for this masterpiece."
3,Contains far more history than is good for it,"Author Carr is an historian first and a novelist second. He packs his story with far too many fascinating facts and digressions, which work against maintaining the tension so crucial to a mystery. It's as if, having done all that research, he can't bear to leave out a single fact. For example, a chapter involving Theodore Roosevelt and his family seems to serve no other purpose than to demonstrate that Carr has indeed read about them. Also, I would agree with other readers when they say the characters are flat."
2,A good story marred by cardboard characters...,A good serial-killer story in a well researched and reconstructed historical background. Too pity the characters are mere stereotypical cardbord figures more suitable for comics than for a serious novel as this one.
2,"Good concept, poorly executed.","Other than some interesting historical tidbits, the book has absolutely no appeal. After reading this book, I now hate Teddy Roosevelt; and he is the only character that leaves any impression.A note to the author: Don't write in the first person. You are not good enough to pull it off."
2,Not worth the effort,"This is the sort of book that offers two things--a plot solution (who, what, why) and lots of history about turn-of-the-century New York. I lost interest in both before I was halfway through (I turned to the end to see if I'd missed anything and decided I hadn't). I can see where someone else might find both interesting, but that someone has to put up with a lot of wooden writing in the meantime. I don't like historical fiction in which the main effort is to introduce historical figures or incidents in clever ways. I'd rather read a biography or well-written history. I DO like historical fiction that presents a single person or incident with a freshness that makes them come alive again. This book failed to do that. Edith Pargeter is an example of a writer who does this very successfully."
2,Historically accurate but fictionally lacking,"I was quite impressed with the historical accuracy of this book yet it was not a very good mystery. Carr felt the need to slap us in the face with each clue, explaining everything to death and over and over! I think this book would have been a lot better if the author had left a lot more of the mystery to be solved by the readers, such as why the murders occurred on Holy Days and why near water. This book will never have to be interpreted by an English class, that's for sure! I feel Carr would have profitted by acting as a consultant and letting someone else write the book. A review I read recently noted that there are no memorable lines in the book and that's a darn shame. Such a beautifully set up scene and such a wonderful chance to develop a great story but this is not done. And 500 pages...gee whiz! Say it in fewer pages."
2,"Wordy, self conscious and gratuitous","Carr's writing style is really a problem here. A great English teacher once told me to write a sentence, then rewrite it at least twice to make it shorter. Before he ventures into another novel I would suggest he reads a few Hemingway novels to cut the unecessary verbage out of his work. I also can't help but think that the author had visions of a movie deal in his head the whole time he was writing this book; the dialogue is very self conscious and unrealistic. Finally, the violence is way overboard - gratuitous and totally unecessary to make the story successful."
2,don't rush to read,"the premise was interesting; however, it seemed to drag . . . it seems from other reviews that you either loved this or did not . . . count me in latter category."
2,Finishing this one was a challenge,"I felt no connection to any of the characters in this. It was like the author was, most of the time, just trying to prove to his audience his knowledge of turn of the century life in New York City. These facts were educational but alone they were not enough to pull it off."
2,Another overrated bestseller,"Carr has obviously done his research, but he wears it on his sleeve. Creative Writing 101 would have taught him that shoveling on research or backstory is not the way to engage the reader. For example, when they first go to Delmonico's, Carr brings the story to a halt by launching into several pages of dry narrative on the history of the restaurant. He could learn a few things from historical Romance -- it's true, don't laugh. Romance writers like Penelope Williamson, and others, demonstrate how rich historical detail can be seamlessly woven into narrative and dialog."
4,"A good read, and yet...","I loved the great historical details and the growing sense of camaraderie among the unorthodox investigating team--and yet...I can't give it full marks because I found myself rewriting the main character a bit in my head, just to deepen the story by increasing the emotional conflict. I agree with another reader-reviewer who mentioned Moore was a bit dull as narrator. I imagined him as a necessarily closeted gay man, and it made the whole novel more compelling and complex. Just my alternative reading."
1,Did not like,"I love history and I love the history of NYC. I tried to read this book on more than one occasion. I gave up! Ok, someone suggested I say why I did not like this book. It was slow, very slow. I never ever talk about what a book is about in my reviews, a friends mother told me years ago, never read the back of the book, look at the reviews. Than came Amazon :) Anyway, I just could not get into it, I felt the book was slow, fall asleep fast slow."
1,"A boring, predictable waste of an intriguing premise","The story itself sounds interesting: a murder mystery set in 1800s New York, featuring a variety of characters that includes Theodore Roosevelt. Unfortunately, it's presented in such a routine, pedestrian manner that one trudges through the book with little excitement. Worse, Carr's obsession with the seedier aspects is particularly grating."
1,The Long Dull Weekend,"I had the misfortune to listen to an UNabridged version of this book narrated by Jonathan Marosz for Books on Tape. It was one of the most sloppily written books I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. Marosz' droning narration gratingly served to completely intensify the amaturish writing. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot plodded like a plow horse, and the ending came straight from the comic books. The story line was just barely interesting enough to keep me struggling through the 13 cassettes. I will never listen to or read another book by this author. Edward Herrmann's abridged version of this pretentious and gratuitously gruesome book has to be an improvement. Anything to shorten the agony."
2,The Alienist,"Very prompt, arrived very quickly. Advertised as nearly new, but it was very marked & quite grotty. However price cheap enough & I was glad to get hold of this book."
1,Incredibly boring,"Finally threw in the towel three quarters of the way through...didn't even bother skipping ahead to see how it ended. I kept thinking it would get better, but it never did. From now on, when I see ""New York Times Bestseller"" on the cover of a novel, I'll take it as a warning."
3,Lame...,I read this book a while back and was excited when i first picked it up. It goes into great detail in regards to the tactics of forensic science during the beginning of the 19th century. The build up is great and one would expect the ending to follow suit. NOOOO...it was a huge letdown. I stopped reading for a while because of this book. I was actually turned off from books due to this ending.
4,Historical novel with a modern touch,"I was surprised by this novel, mainly by the historical detail it contained. Having grown up in NYC, it was particularly interesting to read about the city as it was 100 years ago. Mr. Carr is adept at creating atmosphere primarily in his detailed visual descriptions and discussion of sociopolitical forces as they relate to the story's characters. He is very well-versed in the history of 19th century NY and this book is a testament to that knowledge. The character development also kept me interested. The main flaw is the rather unoriginal and often boring serial-killer storyline. To be fair, however, Mr. Carr does spin a good tale. If you enjoy atmospheric mysteries with a touch of nostalgia, you'll probably enjoy this book."
2,Empty calories,"Only the books's thorough research makes it readable. The glimpses of 1896 New York are fascinating, and Carr admirably refrains from moralizing about the slum boys whose circumstances lead them to prostitution. He has fun with the character of Theodore Roosevelt, but the crucial player, the alienist Kreizler, has no real center, and the other characters are ciphers. The climactic scene with the killer on the water tower is a huge disappointment, a washout in terms of suspense or emotional catharsis. If the author had written ""he noised"" instead of ""he said"" one more time I would have thrown this book against a wall. If you care about writing style as much as plot, the book will annoy you. If style doesn't matter and you can tolerate frequent plot doldrums, you might enjoy it."
3,Very long read....,"The ad nauseum Victorian detail slows the reader down to a crawl. As a rule my taste leans to detailed thorough novels, but this is a bit excessive. That said, before I knew anything about the author, I believed he must be a true native New Yorker. I think he loves his city and it's history. I did enjoy his sideline historical accounts regarding the Five Points, the corrupt police department, the problems of essentially unchecked immigration and it's poverty. I also enjoyed the details of the famous restaurants and historical sites.The mystery was interesting and seemed like a Nineteenth Century CSI drama. I am an avid mystery reader and would recommend it only to those who enjoy overly long period pieces. If you are planning a long trip on a train and hope to sleep most of the way. Guaranteed to make you sleepy."
1,ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz,"I couldn't follow it. I tried really hard to stick with it, but found it terribly boring and very hard to follow. I am sure that it was a good book, and worth it if you read the whole thing. I just couldn't do it, I kept falling asleep. I normally really enjoy this type of story, and hate to leave a book unread. But I had to this time, I am sorry I missed out."
1,Life is too short,"If you enjoy reading about an unknown person knocking on the door for TWO PAGES until, on the THIRD page, it is finally revealed WHO is knocking on the door, then this is the book for you. Tries too hard for witty repartee which makes for very tedious reading. This book could have been 1/4 the length. Needless to say, it did not hold my interest. Too wordy, too boring, and not at all clever."
2,Promising Premise Squandered,"This could have been a really fun, interesting, and unique book, but Carr blows it by constantly intruding upon the story with his lame 20th C. scolding of 19th C. mores. The characters are vehicles to let us know that Carr thinks oppressing women and minorities is bad thing. I hate it when historical novels are populated with characters from Suburban USA circa 1990. Next!"
5,"Before ""Serial Killers"" were known to exist..........","...........there were people smart enough to know that some killers, kill due to mental illness and with a pattern. This book follows a few people in early 1900's NY that are trying to catch a suspected serial killer before ""profiling"" actually existed. I highly recommend this book to everyone that likes an intelligent and challenging journey."
3,"Fasinating, yet slow","I found this book to be facinating and compelling, but towards the middle I thought that it dragged out a little bit. The book captivated me, but it took sometime for the characters to reach their goal. It had an excellent build up of characters and I was glued to it."
4,Extremely entertaining and suspensful!!!,"I am a little biased because I live in the Gramercy Park area and spend most evenings in the downtown area of NYC (especially Union Sq), and that is one reason why I really enjoyed this book. It was suspensful, original, the characters were interesting, and the history of NYC was great to read about. I also enjoyed all the passages where the team went into detail of who, what, where, etc. regarding the killer. I thought it was fascinating to read about how they came up with the conclusions they did. It could have been more suspensul if Mr. Carr wrote more about how the killer was stalking the team, but overall-QUITE ENJOYABLE."
4,Starts with a bang! Ends with a fizzle.,"The first 10 chapters of this book are among the best I have read. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the way that Carr brought the reader inside the character of Moore and made him/her see the world through his eyes. That was great. I enjoyed the character of Kriezler immensely. The whole setup of the story was mesmerizing and made my heart rage as the team was assembled and they learned slowly about the killer. The way that Carr slowly dished out pieces of information to the reader was brilliant and the way he ended each chapter with a curious lead in to the next kept me up way past midnight almost every night I sat down to read this book. The only problem I had was the way that it ended. The book built to a crescendo and then died without enough suspense. Other than that it was one of the best books that I have ever read. By the way, if anyone can help me figure out the significance or the symbolism of the last line I would appreciate it."
2,A simple pulp thriller aspiring to literature (no such luck),"Don't be fooled by this book--Carr tries his hand at crafting prose that he obviously hopes will be considered Literature. But he flies too close to the sun, and this book is ultimately just pulp fiction and not even up to Stephen King or Ken Follett standards. Carr overeaches his ability as a writer in most of his imagery and he frequently seems to use language to impress the reader with his vocabulary. ALso not a teribbly inspired plot -- I expected a more clever wrap-up."
5,Not Just A Great Story -,"But an educational one as well. I wrote this review: :Scarlet Women, by J.D. Christilian is just as captivating and similar in style to the Alienist. I would highly recommend this book for fans of The Alienist"" - a while back but decided that further must be said since I just re-read it - again.The Alienist was much better than the follow-up to this stunner but it is still a must read for ever mystery lover, New Yorker or history buff.Caleb Carr weaves real life historical figures into his brilliant fictional novel - it is so well done that it is scary.If you liked it read Scarlet Women and Time and Again by Jack Finney."
4,Catchy Title,"Without ever having read Caleb Carr, I found this book intriguing. Carr's style, though a little slow at times, is simple and enjoyable. The content however, is fanscinating. Like a true crime story, it is gripping. It's setting-NYC about a hundred years ago, before the evolution of modern investigation-is what gives this novel it's flare.Don't expect intellectual stimulation, but fun...it's jam packed."
5,What a journey in time!,Caleb Carr takes the reader back to turn of the century New York like none other. I'm a history teacher and I find myself recommending this book to my students on a daily basis. Carr captures the feel of New York as it had to be during the 1890's while he tells us a story that could be happening today. The characters became my friends and I finished the book looking forward to hearing from them again. That's history that comes alive!
4,Great Book-graphic parts can make it hard to stomach,"Caleb Carr's The Alienist explores the process of tracking a killer in the 1890's. Without the use of high-tech ""CSI"" tools, Dr. Lazlo Kreizler is forced to track a killer through use of profiling. Told by John Moore, a writer, the Alienist follows the investigation as the detectives uncover more bodies and more clues to the killer's past and mindset. While I found this book exciting and interesting, It has many graphic parts when describing the deceased and I could see this as being a hard book for some to get through. Overall I liked the book and the characters in it and don't regret reading it."
5,Love this book,"I must say, always has been a favorite of mine. I lent the book to a friend & he loved it as well. Now I want to read it agian & have it to keep in my kindle."
4,Riveting!,"I loved this book! A suspenseful crime drama, and an interesting perspective on the history of turn of the century NYC! I wish that Hollywood would pass on some of the tripe that insists on producing, and turn this book, and it's sequel, ""The Angel Of Darkness"", into feature films! I think they would both be big hits!The Angel of Darkness"
1,"DRAWN OUT, DULL & BORING","This was simply the kind of book you could very easily put down. It took over a year (and some serious ""stick-with-it-ness"") to finish this book. Carr does a great job of presenting historical New York, but for a mystery/thriller I found it to be slow paced and uncaptivating."
2,Full of filler and fluff...not as good as The Alienist,"As my brief line says, this book was full of paragraphs to skip over, repeated themes and overexplanation. It felt like a follow-up book that wasn't well planned or executed. I was glad when I finished it."
1,This book was a dreadful experience.,"At the outset this book was a smorgasbord of rich, turn of the century language, with a touch of history for spice. At the description of the first crime, the horrible mutilation of a young male prostitute, the book went downhill with incredible speed. The language lost it richness, the character's values shifted from turn of the century to contemporary and the mean side of the poorest areas of New York came to dominate a really dreary story."
3,It is OK...,"Altogether I would call this an OK book. It is not fantastic, but it is not horrible either. The book was very slow and boring during the first 200 pages or so. And, in many ways, it was almost a chore for me to read it because I was so determined to get to an interesting part. Since the book was written first-person, you did not really get to know the characters very well. The book fails to take you away because it is so weighed down by historical. And though I LOVE historical fiction, the historical aspects of this book failed to flow with the plot. Probably the only part of the book that I would consider remarkable was the plot. Carr did an amazing job in the murderer's life and how technology, when it came to solving a crime, was still evolving. Only recommended if you have a LOT of patience and time on your hands."
2,"OK, Not Great","I can't confirm the plaudits that have followed this book. It has an interesting hook, putting the modern notion of ""profiling"" into the ahistorical context of 1896. And the references to old New York piqued my interest and made me drag out my copy of Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York."" But overall, The Alienist read like a mediocre Hollywood psychological thriller.Frankly I am amazed it has not yet been made into a film as it would perfectly play on the big screen. A pitch must have already been made: ""All right, get this. It's like Silence of the Lambs crossed with Gangs of New York. A psychologist with revolutionary ideas - I'm thinking Johnny Depp - assembles a team of amateur detectives to catch a Jack the Ripper clone in New York in 1896. And it has Teddy Roosevelt in it!""Not that any of the modern teenage audience would know who Teddy Roosevelt was.It's ok. Just nothing incredible."
3,History or Fiction!,"As a New Yorker I was fascinated with the descriptions of the city that seemed to be as much of this book as the story was. His unfortunate injection of real-life characters (Roosevelt, Riis, Morgan, etc.)lent incredulity to the story which was otherwise cogent and a fair read, but left something to be desired, particularly the staged ending."
4,Darkness in the Gilded Era,"You are irresistibly drawn into this book, especially if you are a fan of murder mysteries, New York history, psychological thrillers, crime fiction or all of the above. Caleb Carr is one of the few writers to tackle late 19th century New York culture and crime with convincing authority. As dark, dangerous, and alluring as any of the dives he describes."
4,A brilliant depection of investigative methodology,"Ok, so its not onyl that but a great tale. At times, the period elements seem unnecessary, but it continues to remind the reader of the differences between the society of 1890's NY and our current one. It also shows just how some of own came to be. The story is not just one of a murder-mystery and its subsequent unravelling, but one of the people involved. The various sub plots weave in and out, creating vision of depth that the reader so easily falls into. The characters are not overly developed (the time frame hardly allows for much), but the events serve to highlight and bring them life with the pain, triumph and importance that is so reflective in our own lives. This is an excellent tale set in a perdiod of american history that is arguably one of our most turbulent. I found this story... alive."
4,Pretty darned cute.,"I bought the book for one specific pattern, a grass-green baby blanket with fluffy Berroco ""Plush"" sheep grazing on it. The pattern calls for Goa, a cotton yarn which has been discontinued, but I found a good substitute.The pattern was clearly written and easy to follow. I am thrilled with how it turned out, and so is the recipient, her baby, and everyone else who sees it. The rest of the patterns in the book appear to be clear and well-written too. However, if I never make another thing from this book, I will consider the price well worth it for just that one pattern."
5,24 winners,"Some really terrific blankies in this knit collection. My favorites are:Sampler blanket by Margarita Mejia which has 8 beautiful squares and a alovely lace edging. Entrelac blanket by Song Palmese, Geometric blanket by Wendy Bergman done in the domino type knitting in 25 squares. Crazy stripes blanket by Veronica Manno using Koigu Kersti in 9 colors. All of the blankets are interesting and the choice of type is wide. The cover blanket is one of the less interesting ones. Only 3 are for beginners with several being for the intermediate or experienced knitter. As a new grandmother, I'd suggest knitting them either in cotton or acrylic instead of wool (which some of them call for)."
2,Not up to Taylor Caldwell's others,"I was captivated by ""Ceremony of the Innocent"" and have loved other books by Taylor Caldwell, but ""To Look and Pass"" was depressing, dull, slow, and pointless. Don't spend your time or your money."
3,I don't get it!,"Help! TTouch is reccomended by everybody, but this book doesn't make sense to me. I know the techniques work, and there is obviously a unifying structure, but I can't find it! This book seems to be a series of simple things made complex by the addition of cutesy names. I have heard from too many reputable sources that TTouch is very effective, but now I don't know where to go to learn more about it."
3,It's a Party Tyme Karaoke...,"The song choices on this disc are great and really popular with the groups I use the disc with. BUT...Much like other Party Tyme brand CD+G's that I've bought, the words don't quite line up with the music when highlighting."
4,The best dating book,A friend loaned me this book when I was single and I could not have been more thankful to her! This is really an easy read and a gives you a little internal soul searching and changes that need to happen in your life for God's best to come to you.
2,"Good principles, but lacks logical reasoning","Although as a Christian I agree with the principles in this book, one dissapointment is that the book is targeted towards only those who already agree with the author's point of view. By making fun of opposing viewpoints, dismissing them without logically arguing against them, or simply stating his views without giving reasons, anyone who doesn't already agree with the author would be quickly alienated."
5,The Last Dating Book I needed to Read,"I wrote my review of this book a little over three years ago (Feb. 4, 2002). Exactly 2 months later, I met the woman was to marry at the end of 2003. I won't go so far as to say that this was all I needed to get over my problems, but I stopped making the mistakes I had made before. What more do I need to say?In an age when 'hooking up' is almost more common that committed, healthy relationships, and for those that prefer the latter, this book ought not go unread (especially if you are licking your wounds as I was when I read it)."
5,gift,"I purchased this book off my granddaughter's wish list for her birthday. She was very pleased when she received it. She hasn't had time to complete it yet, because of homework and activities at school.The Ten Commandments of Dating: Time-Tested Laws for Building Successful Relationships"
1,Terrible book,"Like some other reviewers, I didn't realise the book would be full of religious overtones, so this was extremely off putting - the back of the book mentions nothing about religion, so it's a bit misleading. Yes, like someone else said, the title could have been a clue - but it didn't click with me.I did decide to give the book a chance despite this, but I stopped reading when the author advised against ""exotic relationships"". I couldn't believe that in this day and age someone is espousing such rubbish. He thinks your relationship has a better chance of working if you are of the same cultural background - very closed minded and verging on racist.Luckily I didn't pay much for the book, because I threw it out."
2,Be aware of the religious overtone of the book,"The principles themselves are quite good. However, the context of the book is over-religious. Every other page, it would mention the name of god. For an atheist, it undermined the values of the principles themselves. And I felt that the summary or reviews should reflect the religious overtone so that people are not surprised by it.Some of the principles, even though it may work for a minor population, seems a bit unrealistic, such as waiting until marriage for sex. Finding out about sexual compatibility is an important aspect as the book has indicated that physical compatibility is important. I could see the value of not letting hormonal and emotional influences guide one's judgment. However, the extreme stance perfectly contradicts the discovery of physical compatibility in this case."
2,should of realized...,"... by the title that it would be religiously based, but i thought it was merely a clever title. if you don't want to read about how God influences things, then don't buy this."
4,Great guide for gals and guys,"I enjoyed reading this book. I actually read it along with a girlfriend and a boyfriend. Both had different opinions (of course). But the common belief among all of us is that this is one man's opinion, like so many other relationship books. You can relate the suggestions in the book to your beliefs whether religious or not. There were definitely some ""ah-ha"" moments and strategies worth trying."
2,There are better dating books out there,"I was disappointed in this book. It has some generally good advice, but I found it overly simplistic and the tone of the book annoyed me--I found it a little condescending and too rule-based, but perhaps that was just me. It is after all, called the Ten Commandments! The major concepts are helpful, but there are other dating books that cover similar material on a deeper level and from a more nuanced perspective."
5,WOW,"My kids made me listen to this music. I'm not one who usually likes pop music, but I found Britt very catchy and fresh. Our whole family enjoys her sounds, especially when we are wakeboarding. The music is driving and the lyrics are sound. Britt is a great witness to our children's friends and enjoyed by the whole family."
5,Quite a trip,"It's very atmospheric from the start but initially quite slow. Although that might be a good thing, because the Poland that Powers introduces us to is quite different from where we live (at least in my case - I'm from Australia) and takes some time getting used to. There's also a large cast and they're all well fleshed out, warts and all.The second half of the book is gripping and profoundly moving. Kept me going all day, couldn't put it down."
3,cheese and crackers...,"in response to the last (""only"" at this time) review... putz! you don't give a low rating to ""the wrong music"".... d'oooh... stick a pencil in my head... this release is 80 minutes of, ""oh yea that was in that movie!"" quite a few memorale fav's... all too short in most cases -"
3,Interesting and disappointing at the same time,"On the one hand, the various learning styles were interesting. I don't think I would call them learning styles per se, but more general concepts of how one processes information, from meeting people to entering a room for the first time.As a learning method, the book falls short. The tests lean heavily on 8 specific styles. At the same time, the author acknowledges mixed or integrated styles (combinations of the 8, applied in different ways). Yet after identifying these two styles, the author abandons them for the rest of the book, providing no guidance or suggestions at all for applying an integrated or mixed learning style. You're left on your own to figure it out, which pretty much negates the book's usefulness.In general, it was an interesting read for the concepts and ideas. For practical application, it was disappointing."
5,"It hit me right betwwen the eyes (or in my case, ears)","An excellent book! After the two tests (which put me strongly in the ""Left-Brain, Auditory"" category), the description was so close to me that it scared me. Not like one of those Astrological signs where you say: ""yeah, that sounds like me AND ANOTHER MILLION PEOPLE"". This one gets you squarely. And leads you to the quickest and best way to learn new stuff."
5,Beautifully refined performances throughout.,"I found this CD an absolute delight! From opening to closing measure of each piece, the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Antoni Wit, give beautifully refined and idiomatic performances. Tempi tend to be little more laid back than in other versions I've heard, but this more than compensated for by the nicely rustic, Slavonic character with which the music is played. The CD's sound is superb throughout, aided greatly by the warm and resonant acoustics of the Concert Hall of the Polish Radio, where this recording was made. Aficionados of Antonin Dvorak's music will find this a most enjoyable listening experience."
3,Beautiful music,"This CD contains several orchestral piece by Dvorak. All are good, but the first, A Hero's Song is the most dramatic and powerful. Unfortunately, its performance is not the best around, and this reviewer has heard more powerful and richer recordings on the radio. The CD sound quality is great though. The number of pieces is OK, and the CD could have included another track."
2,"Limited, yet suprisingly so","Dashing any ephemeral streaks of insightful work with skull-numbingly, hyper-actively repetitive drum-and-bass noise applications, this particular project yields little more then a one dimensional horror-speed gimmick, though there are just enough fleeting moments of compelling material that makes you know Plotkin can do better."
4,They use it in my son's Kindergarten class...,"They use it in my son's Kindergarten class, which is why I ordered it for his birthday. The pictures are crisp clear colorful and interesting. He loves sitting and looking at it and looking up words (and I never would have thought he'd be such a book worm!). There are a few words that he wanted to look up that were not in there...cheetah, for intance. But it is a good starter dictionary and since we have 3 children, I am sure it will get passed down even if he moves on to something more complex quicker than we thought."
3,Weak special effects. However original story and good cast.,"Although this is definately a b-movie it was interesting to see Jeff Wincotte and Stacy Keach work together. I was very impressed with the actor who plays Soldier #2. Joseph Clark. I have seen this guy in other action films and on television. Although he had a small role, I felt his performance stood out among Jeff Wincotte's and Stacy Keach."
4,recommended for PACEs,communication part is the best. But the History section is not very good general with no specificationsthey have a section of previous experiences and stations plus quotations from candidates and examiners
2,Dino Felipe - Xanaconversex,"Dino Felipe's XANACONVERSEX features a blue-skinned video-game-playing mutant on the cover--and, yeah, that's pretty much what it sounds like, too. There's blippery aplenty on ""Slutt Petal (2 Crunch)."" ""Plunk Extend"" is two minutes of rhythmic chaos, while ""Strictly Genericize"" is its melodic equivalent. ""Pinky"" starts making a little more sense, but there's way too much noise-for-noise's-sake and not enough consideration to the tracks. The album seems as if it were tossed-off to fulfill a contractual obligation. ""Butterfri"" shows Felipe a bit more focused, and it works much better than the short tracks. Even ""Sexual Boats (Guitar Floats),"" at three minutes, has some semblance of actual song structure. So perhaps it's better to think of this as an EP with 4 real tracks--since it clocks in just over 25 minutes--and plenty of filler."
4,It could happen ...,"What struck me the most about this film is the fact that the story line is so believable. Two ordinary guys, one married the other engaged are about to go into business together and in their quest for funding one of them runs into an old friend who they immediately pitch their plan to. The acquaintance listens promising to get back to them which he does, the only problem is that his terms are outrageous at which time the partners find out that they are now dealing with the Russian mob. Things turn ugly and life becomes all about survival - do you succumb?, do you run?, do you do the unthinkable? Based on a true story this film will keep you on edge and make you think 'what would I do'?"
2,Agree with Navy Wife... Rent First,"I rented it and personally thought it was so bad that I turned it off and watched a movie instead. It starts out with the Mayor walking you around and having you build stuff. I personally thought that it was a little difficult (and I hate to say it, but stupid) to build things. My house and workshop looked weird- nothing how I would have liked to build them. Then the mayor told me to put a chair together and I had had enough, this is when I hit the power button. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but I don't really want to. Give me a new version of Sim City for Wii (I have downloaded the old one on my Wii for $5 and played it for hours and hours!)"
2,First SIMS game,"This is the first game of the SIMS genre that my family has ever purchased (or even really seen much of). For years I've heard people talk about ""Sim this"" and ""Sim that"" ... ""Sim City"" etc. Based on the popularity I figured there had to be something to it. So when my 9 year old wanted Wii MY SIMS I figured, ""finally, we'll be part of the SIM craze.""Ok, I just don't get it. The game seems tedious... no the game IS tedious. And WHY god, WHY would EA make all the Sims talk in that ""teletubby gibberish? As a parent do you know what an hour of listening to that babble will do to your brain? I'm getting ready to climb a tower with a high-powered rifle. If my son ends up liking this game, I'm moving the Wii to the basement.I give it 2 stars because I know kids love it... so clearly I've crossed over into the ""you hooligan kids get off my lawn"" phase of life, but lord have them speak a real language."
3,Fun for a little while?,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my daughter, she turned 10. She enjoyed playing the game for about a week then said, ""It's boring"". She hasn't played it since. Just thought I'd share with others who might want to purchase this game."
3,Kinda fun,"This game is kinda fun, but the instructions are bad, and dont tell you how to get anywhere,or what to do. I give this game 3 stars, but barly. I would recomend this game to big-time gammers, but not first time, like me."
2,Will bore teens and adults,"If you're looking for a simple game for elementary school children, this might work. If you're older than that, do not bother. It is too easy, boring, and nothing like the Sims like the name suggests. Here's how the game goes: Talk to a character who tells you to build something, easily collect materials, and build it by matching shapes. Even the shape matching is no challenge because it lights up which pieces go where. I'm disappointed and glad I only rented it."
3,Fun but annoying,"If you like My Sims Kingdom you will like this one. But you have to get five stars. But it takes forever. I just finished yesterday and I got it in January. It's Augest 11, 2009.I mean It's fun the first few times but it gets tiring after you get use to it. And when your diging it kind of freezes. And when it turns night you person freezes and everything you do. Bye"
4,Good game but not great,Though I like this game but its not too great in comparison to other Sims games.
3,"Repetative, but okay","Definitely not what I was expecting from a Sims title. It gets very repetative and there seems to be no big goal in sight, like there is with most of the DS and GBA titles. I think they could've done a much better job, and I hope My Sims Kingdom has a lot of changes."
4,age appropriate,"My Daughter pick this game out with her Birthday gift card...She loved it! She enjoys the SIMs line however I usually don't like her playing them as they are rated teen and she just turned 9, but MySims is rated E and it is very age appropriate."
5,Fun for me and the kids,"My daughters, ages 8 and 12, really like this game and so do I. We each have our own town (there are three slots available) and have fun watching each other play. It is appropriate for young kids (nothing suggestive like the sims PC games) but still fun for adults. I wish there was the ability to visit their characters and towns when I am in my game. I also wish that we could play with more than one player at a time. Those are small wishes though - we all love this game. Load time is a little long, and there is a load screen every time you enter a room or go to a new part of town. It is easy to lose track of how long you have been playing."
5,MySims,"If you are looking for a game that is easy for kids around the ages of 8-10, then you should pick this game up. It's a pretty basic game to play and it will keep you occupied for long periods of time. Though it seems a little monotone, it's graphics are really good and the plot is pretty interesting. I like the ability to choose who you want in your little town and build it up based on their needs and wants."
4,Nice Game,We found this game for our 7-yr old boy and he loves it. It has kept him busy for many hours and there is still much for him to do. It's almost addicting. He can play for hours creating things and doesn't realize how the time has flown by! It's a nice alternative to action games that get him excited. This actually calms him down.
4,Love this game... good for creativity and imagination,I bought this game for my daughter and she loves it. She is 8 1/2. She loves being able to create all the different types of house designs. And she loves being able to interact with different people. She has to read a lot which helps with her reading also. I have to say I really enjoy the game also!
2,Fun if you are a child?? Maybe??,"Prior to purchasing My Sims I had received My Sims Kingdom which I really enjoyed playing. I was highly disappointed in My Sims when I began playing it. The game seems to be really amateurish and not nearly as developed as My Sims Kingdom which has come a long way since My Sims. The game takes an incredible time to load which it does frequently, including every time you go in or out of a building. It is a very time consuming game because everything takes a loooong time to do, and it really shouldn't be such a long process.I do not recommend this game. If you like the Sims, buy Sims My Kingdom!"
4,Highly addictive!,"The game is very addictive will lots to do. You can spend endless hours building house, performing tasks or interacting with other Sims. My only complain: the lag time between actions. The game could have been designed better to avoid that."
2,Simszzzzzzzzz,"I bought this for my wife, expecting the same sort of game play as Sims and Sims 2 or perhaps SimCity. Boy were we disappointed.Game play is simple to the point of pointlessness. Loading screens abound and get longer the longer you play. In build mode, the challenge is mainly how to get the controller to put the piece where you want it. At first, I thought there was a hardware problem, as the screens bogged and the cd drive began to make lots of noise.As others have stated, multiplayer and some way to save and trade your designs could have made this a better product. Judging by the way it chugs and bogs down, we may be asking too much from this title already.The worst aspect is that you are essentially a one-person factory for your town. It would not be so bad, if only all this building had a point. I have played it up to 3 1/2 stars, and I am done with it. My wife didn't even get past 2. She says it puts her to sleep."
2,Review of Service,"I liked how fast I got the game in the mail. The game worked the first time we played, however the game is now frozen and you can't continue to play now. So I am back to having no game again!!"
3,sims game,"My 9 yr old wanted this game. He wanted a game in which he could build his own house, go to work,ect like in real life. It is a too much reading for him and a little difficult for him to do the tasks. What I don't like is when the Sims characters speak; it is in French but, you can read what they are saying in English. The game is ok, but nothing spectacular, in my opinion."
2,"Pretty good, but then it's boring","I first got this game when we rented it from hollywood video. I played it forever. My mom had to force me to stop and eat dinner. After about two days of costant playing, I got bored with it and never played it again. Im a novice Sims player, so Im not sure if this is like the other games. If you dont like the cutesy type games, dont buy it. But even if you do, rent it first, just to be sure."
2,NOT A Sims-Style Game,"If you are looking for a suitable alternative to The Sims, look elsewhere! Sims-style games should be open-ended, with no real ""point"" other than simulation of life. This game is basically an RPG in sims' clothing - you are assigned tasks (read: quests) by various members of the town, with the overall goal of rebuilding a town that has been abandoned. There is no other way to play this game. The load screens take ages (and pop up for everything, even leaving a building). This might be a good game for tiny small children, but for an adult looking for something like The Sims... not so much."
3,It's addicting,"I totally agree with the ""loading"" part of this game. It does take a lot of the times from when you are actually playing the game. All else is fun fun fun!!! I get so addicted with wanting to create new furnitures and move in everyone to town. I love building houses for other sims. You first move in town and then depending on how you create your town, other sims want to move in too. I get excited when there are sims in the hotel. You then ask them to move in and you do jobs for them and get upgraded to a higher star level. The more stars you have, the more access you have through town. Then you get more essences needed to complete jobs for people. It's a fun game for kids and adults. This game created a lot of laughter in my house."
4,"Addicting and fun, but it loses a star for the load screens","I love this game, but hate the load screens. It also bogs down after awhile of playing it.... All that aside, it's a great game. We rented Sims Castaways and didn't like the fact that you couldn't save more than one game at a time......I like the concept of building things in this game. One task I had to do was build a Refrigerator and infuse it with 10 ""essences"" of bacon...mmmmm Bacon... It gets challenging trying to build a 3 block sink but having to use 20 essences of Rainbow Trout...(for those confused by the term essence, they are the spirit of things you find that you can infuse into the items you build.). It's alot like Animal Crossing (one we've rented and loved and will buy) but I wish it loaded the next screen, etc like Animal Crossing did. All in all a fun game that is appropriate for all ages."
4,My Sims,My 6 and 8 year old love this game. Their friends do too. Unfortunately the game is designed for only one player at a time. This has been the only downside we've experienced.
1,"Why the ""dark"" tone?","This is a well designed game that seems designed for young children. My six year old granddaughter enjoys it, BUT comments on the ""ugliness"". Why did they feel the need to inject the sinister mood at so many points? One character says ""you only see the real me at night."" What's that supposed to mean? There are many examples. It would be nice if they gave a simple start up option to configure the game for young children, thus blocking the inuendo."
5,Very good,I enjoy the game very much. It's in great condition and it really feels like it's a new game like I thought out the store.
2,blah,"this game is boring. even my 11 year old daughter gets bored with it. its other down fall is that you can only have 3 accounts. SO if you have 4+ people in your family, only 3 can play ever - unless you delete an account/game."
2,Boring,"Pros:Not so expensiveCan get addictiveCons:Lots of 'long intermissions' between tasksSlow game, skips from time to timeNo online capability"
1,Dreadfully boring and long load screens,"I picked this game up a week ago. I saw a video review, some gameplay and it peaked my interest. I really enjoy Animal Crossing, and expected this game would be the same. Some folks had compared the two. The first thing I noticed was incredibly long load screens, and so frequent, it became annoying pretty fast. I can't accurately say if that gets any better as the game goes on. It was just too frustrating, and I really couldn't get into the game itself.Again, my review is based on first impression, and very little play. I don't plan on keeping the game. Rent the game before you buy is my best advice."
1,voodoo and seances?,"My son bought this with birthday money. When he started playing, some things just didn't seem right to me. ""Essences"" and a lady in one of the first buildings that looked like a witch or something. So I searched the internet, and have learned that as part of the game, you can join seances around a ouiji board. I'm really disappointed in the occult content. The game is rated ""E"" for everyone. I was expecting a fun, kid-friendly game... not expecting this..."
2,"Nice collection, but no exception","This CD contains a nice variety of music, some of which is not recorded very often (Nos. 3, 4, 9, 14). The singing overall is pretty good considering the size of the ensemble (200 voices--none of these works were intended for a choir of this size! ). The diction is good, but the tempi are sometimes too slow and rhythmic (which is uncharacteristic of Russian Church Music). The soloists, unfortunately, need help. The liner notes, despite their brevity, are very good and informative."
2,Disappointing and poorly written,"I love gossipy (particularly gay) Hollywood trash. Perhaps if I had not read ""Hollywood Babylon: It's Back"" first, I might have enjoyed ""Idol Worship"" more, but I doubt it. It is written in a style that simply slows down my reading, frequently having to go back and figure out what phrase was modifying what or wondering who/what the author was talking about. The author is very opinionated, although he seldoms shows the basis of these opinions. Rabbit trails are everywhere. I am still trudging through the turgid prose, which probably would have benefitted from an editor's closer reading before it was published, but I wouldn't reccommend it to friends. Ferguson lost me when he spoke of the ""enormity of [Montgomery Clift's] talent."" Yes, Virginia, he was very talented, but was he really evil?Just because something is about gay people and probably by a gay person, it still has to follow rules of grammar and content to be good."
4,Milwaukee 48-55-0711 Carrying Case for Pistol Grip Tools,"Nice solid carrying case w/convenient tray for bits ets. First one came damaged, top was dented in. Just not enough padding for shipping. Amazon was great and sent a new one immediately. Case is somewhat pricey thats why I only gave it 4 stars."
5,Handy Tool Box,I love this tool box. The large tray makes it easy to store bits and other items needed for efficient use of the drill. The cavernous inner storage holds the drill and cord with room to spare. A nice investment.
1,2nds at Best!,"This is the only Milwaukee product that I have ever purchased that was poorly made. I ordered 4 power tool carrying cases and all four came with very poor paint jobs. The only good thing that came out of this transaction was that the vendor quickly provided cost free return and credited my account. Unfortunately, the vendor was not able to provide top-quality replacements."
5,Excellent accessory to any of the Milwaukee drill motors.,"I don't understand the attraction to all the plastic blow molded cases that come with the power tools today. None of them, even Milwaukee's plastic cases, have additional room for all the accessories you use with electric drill motors. I have a Milwaukee 12Volt screw gun and their "" Magnum Hole Shooter and both came with the steel carrying cases which I fully utilize.The removable tray is excellent for bringing everything I need to the job. Each box is a complete set up for that drill motor. In my "" Magnum box there are drill indexes, set of auger bits, two large Milwaukee self feeding bits, index of screw driver bits, 8"" extensions for the augers and self feeding bits, set of counter sink bits and a right angle head attachment with install tools. I have just as much stuff in the cordless drill case plus the charger and extra battery."
5,Proper Tool Box,"I purchased a Milwaukee 1/2"" magnum drill and it didn't come with a case when I bought it. I ordered this case, it came very quickly in perfect condition. It fits the tool just right and has room for bits and a center punch and hammer.Milwaukee builds tools right!"
3,"Beautifully illustrated, but a chore to read","The glowing accolades of other reviewers steered me towards this book, and I like dogs and grew up with them. I have to say, it was a disappointment and not worthy of the string of 5-star reviews.Pros:* Beautifully illustrated portraits of a wide variety of dogs.* Nice hint of the personalities different pets can have.* Nice printing and binding.Cons:* The ""poetry"" is stilted and awkward. It's so irritating to read, that after reading this aloud to my 3-year old only few times, I found myself skipping the text and just talking about the illustrations.* After a few reads, this won't hold the attention of your child. My children would choose dozens of other books in preference to this, and would never seek it out unprompted.So my overall rating: if you're a dog fancier, you'll probably love it. If you're an average parent looking for a book to engage your children, keep looking."
3,Doesn't get read much,I bought this last year for my daughter's 4th birthday. She loves books - being read to and flipping through herself. I thought this would be a good one since it's mainly drawings. But it has not become her (or my) favorites. It's big and cumbersome and not as interesting as I was hoping. The drawings are nice but don't really tell much of a story. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a child who loves zoos.
1,Really?,"The flod? The genesis? Against Atheism? We Atheist should not talk garbage about o ye old poor chatolics but they can about us, sure... Well that is a world ruled by God indeed. (Get it?).I'll just say one thing, If Moasaurs existed during this flod thingy, they would have survived it, i mean all people and animals (but the ones in the ark) died so that means plenty of easy food. Mosasaurs were amazing and it took a gigantic meteoroid to devastate the earth to kill them not a flod. please."
1,What a waste of money!!,"My review will not be very long because this book simply doesn't deserve it. Almost every page has an ill-informed comment from a creationist viewpoint, and many of these seem totally unrelated to the topic. I have binned this book so that no-one else is subjected to the non-scientific, unrealistic rubbish espoused in it."
5,Wonderfully illustrated creation science,"This wonderfully illustrated creation science book fascinates my 10-year-old son. If your children (or you) like dinosaurs and sea creatures, you will love this Christian portrayal of the true evidence in support of creation. The paintings can be a little scary for younger children (predators), but highly recommended for those 7 and up. Very informative, with finely detailed, modern illustrations."
5,Very interesting,"Great book with great pictures and great stats. It was neat to see an illustration of the creature compared to the average man. Makes you feel kinda small. But, yeah, everyone liked it. Shalom"
4,It worked just fine!,The product came quickly and the directions for installation were easy to follow. We love our Okidata printer and the quality of the things we print off of it.
4,The transfer belt works great,The transfer belt instructions were easy to follow and the product seems to be working fine. No problems were incurred.
2,too shine,It is not real leather. It is too shine and man-made look. I think both material and look are important. I will pay more for something better.
5,MY FATHER WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS B-DAY GIFT!!!! THANKS A BUNCH TO ALL THE PEOPLE AT AMAZON,"WELL SEE I ORDERED SOME STACY ADAMS (CONCORDE 11003) FOR MY DAD BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HE WANTED FOR HIS B-DAY. THE SHOES HE HAD BEFORE WE THE EXACT SAME AS THE ONES THAT I ORDERED HIM ONLY HE LOST THOSE IN A CAR ACCIDENT 3 YEARS AGO. SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN TO MANY STATES, EVEN MEXICO, LOOKING FOR THE SAME SHOES BUT HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO FIND THEM. LUCKILY FOR ME, I WAS ABLE TO FIND THEM ON GOOD OL' AMAZON.COM . IM GLAD TO SAY THAT HE WAS SO VERY HAPPY. HE SAID THAT THEY WERE THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER. THEY ARRIVED ON TIME AND VERY QUICK!!! THANKS AGAIN AMAZON,LETICIA~"
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this item to take along on an extended car trip so I could keep my phone charged. It could smell something hot within 1 minute of plugging the phone in the item hasn't worked since. My phone is fine, thank goodness. I could return it, but the cost and hastle are hardly worth the cost and effort. Not a knock on the vendor, since they have a 100% satisfaction policy, but the item is junk."
4,BIRD SONGS,"BOBBY DAY-GOLDEN CLASSICS: Although hardly a household name, BOBBY DAY (aka BOBBY BYRD) was responsible for a handful of enduring RNB memories that brightened airwaves at the end of 50s. ROCKIN' ROBIN proved an indispensible goodtime smash, while THE BLUEBIRD, THE BUZZARD, & THE ORIOLE was a biped-themed followup hit. More DAY-penned classics fared even better in the hands of other artists. THURSTON HARRIS made big waves when he covered LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE, and THE DAVE CLARK FIVE tackled OVER AND OVER to righteous effect. A young MICHAEL JACKSON even pulled off a spirited ROBIN revival, making it a hit for a second time. GOLDEN CLASSICS serves up the well done originals of these gems, plus a dozen more gritty toe tappers with a few decent ballads mixed in for variety...a nifty history lesson from the pioneering days of rock, pop, and doo wop.RATING: FOUR FEATHERS"
1,not what I expected,"was disappointed in the cd as a whole. I mainly bought it for the ""rockin' robin"" song."
2,Poor Quality,"Don't spend more than $40.00 for this set. It's poor quality. It would be ok if it were classified as a less expensive set, but to sell it for $99.00 much less $300.00 is a rip off. All that is in the set is the comforter, sham and bed skirt (which is exactly what it advertises) but makes it an even bigger rip off."
2,Cheap quality,"Cheap Quality! I have a king set bought a couple of years ago from Stain Mart, so I can do an easy comparison."
1,Dont buy dry clean only,Its a nightmare and most products are made cheaply if you cant wash them in a washer!
5,Good sauce pot!,Hmmm it's been that long since I bought this back in Sept 2009. And I use it alot. I'm the kind of person that leaves the kitchen area to come back to find that I just burnt my pot. Well not with this one. I've done this alot with this pot and there's no sign of it being ruined. Still looks like new. I will most definitely look for Cuisinart products for future purchases.
2,Very loose lid,"I bought this to replace my Anolon hard-anodized 3.5 qt pot that I'd given to my boyfriend. I thought the slightly smaller size would be nice... which I'm sure it would be if I kept this pot. However, the lid on this is very loose and rattly. The lid on my Anolon pourer is so snug and beautiful that I just can't bring myself to keep this one. I'm sending it right back and replacing my lovely Anolon with another Anolon."
2,Lightweight and poorly made,"I bought this saucepan in November 2008 to replace my 10+ year old saucepan bought at Costco. Cuisinart usually makes fairly decent kitchen wares. In this case not. The saucepan was much thinner than my old Costco cookware. It was touted as being sturdy enough to use metal cookware. Not. I threw the pan out yesterday after the nonstick was peeling off in chunks. I never used metal cookware in this pan. I used my silicone or plastic cooking utensils.As to the thin pan. This pan is a lightweight pan that heats up quickly. It does not have a heavy bottom so food could scorch.The only nifty feature about this pan was the strain and pour. Kind of handy but not needed for this size of pan as it would not normally be used to cook pasta. Perhaps sauces and vegetables.By the way, the old Costco 2 quart saucepan is still cooking away..."
4,No more spills,I wanted a saucier which helps preparation of tea everyday without any spills and this works wonders. The right one for the right price. The only problem is that the surface gets scratched easily so need to be careful while handling it around other kitchen items.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I was looking for a small nonstick saucepan to use for making white sauce, etc. I did not need a lid, and thought the pour spout would be useful. This saucepan has all the aforementioned features, and is offered at a reasonable price. It appears to be solidly made, and it DOES sit level when empty. That was the first thing I checked after I unpacked it. I have other Cuisinart nonstick pans, and they all perform well, so I'm expecting the same from this one."
5,Endlessly useful,This is such a great size for a multitude of uses. How did I live without it? Every kitchen needs one. Cleans up like a dream.
5,Beautiful liitle pan; beautiful little price!,"I couldn't be happier with this high quality 1 qt saucier. It's perfect for preparing my individual serving of chai in the traditional method on the stovetop. And with the pouring lip I never spill the hot chai in the transfer to my mug. Other bonuses: heats up quickly and water boils on medium heat, handle stays cool and best of all, clean-up is a breeze. The Amazon price can't be beat!"
3,Not the best,"I wanted this pan because of the pour spout. Although it was reasonably priced, I was disappointed with the weight of the pan. The pan is light and the handle is heavier than the pan. The heavier handle causes the pan to tip when placed on a burner. I found once I poured some liquid into the pan, the tipping was no longer a problem. I would call this a design flaw. As far as cooking - the pan does the job for me which is to warm milk to add to a recipe."
4,Almost perfect,"Very nice pot with the only shortcoming being the ill-fitting lid...it's pretty loose, but not problematic. Hard anodized is my new way to go....well...maybe the handle is a little on the thin side for grabbing too. Could be beefier for turning to drain heavy stuff."
3,"Beautiful, but not sturdy","I have these dishes in Nuance of Sage. I love their big, simple, clunky style. They have a beautiful look, bold earthy colors. But, they are heavy in the hand and the cups and bowls are very awkward to stack in the dishwasher and cupboards. One other thing that bothers me, I thought this was stoneware. After 3wks, one of my salad plates came out of the dishwasher chipped. I called Pfaltsgraph for a replacement (great customer service btw) and I was told these dishes are EARTHENWARE not STONEWARE. Earthenware is not as durable as stoneware. I am disappointed. I was hoping these dishes would last me years, but after what I've seen in 3wks, I'll be getting new dishes probably in 2yrs."
1,I might as well have thrown my money in the garbage.,I loved these dishes and purchased 12 place settings. Within 2 days 3 of the plates had chips. Two years later I have only 3 pieces without chips. The last time I bought dishes was 15 years ago when I got married and they lasted a good 14 years and cost much less. I will never buy another Pfaltzgraff product again.
1,"DON""T BUY","I purchased all colors of the Nuance collection with the idea having a colorful tablescape, a little over a year ago (2007). I am extremely disappointed with this product. I used everyday tableware from Lenox for 25 years without a chip. During this 25 year time span I raised two very active boys. Not one dish was broken or chipped. I purchased the Nuance dishes for my new house. Most of the plates, bowls and cups are now chipped showing white that looks horrible next to the bring Nuance colors. For the price I paid this should not happen. I will never purchase your products again and I will not recommend this line or any Pfaltzgraff's product to anyone."
1,Nuance review,"I purchased 9-four piece place settings (red, sage, and yellow) of these dishes when we moved into our new home. They look great but didn't hold up for daily use. They chip very easily and the chips are obvious and make them worthless for future use. These dishes aren't good for the microwave either--they take all the heat in the microwave leaving the food cold. They are too expensive to replace the chipped pieces so now I hold a few unchipped dishes out for special place settings and have purchased something different for everyday use. Very disappointed."
1,Dont buy these dishes,"Loved these dishes when I saw them- they are even more beautiful in person than in the picture. BUT...they are heavy, huge, and barely fit in the dishwasher. Still, I kept them and put them on my buffet (the dinner plates dont fit in my kitchen cabinets) because I loved the way they look. I have 12 settings- plates, bowls, cups, and other pieces also. However, I owned them only a few weeks when I got the first chip in a plate. Now, 3 years later, almost every single piece has atleast one chip. They chip SO easily- its terrible. We are very careful with them- it doesnt matter though. I would never recommend buying these to anyone. So disappointing."
3,Look great on the table but...,"I searched for a long time before buying these dishes. I bought both round and square in red and gold. I love the deep bowls and the way that they look on the table. But after only a few months of use several are chipped. However, the biggest draw back is how hot they get in the microwave. So hot that we have burned ourselves on them. We have had to go back to an older set for using in the microwave because the danger of someone dropping a hot dish full of hot food is too great. I love the look but am going to have to find a safer replacement."
3,A bit dissapointing,"After reading the details on this book I have to admit that I was dissapointed when I received it. Not only was it a smaller book than I anticipated, but I felt somewhat ""empty"" after reading it.I love dragons, but found that the dragons in these poems were remote and a little unbelievable.The artwork is beautiful though."
5,The one I reach for...,"I have owned this drill for about 1 year. I also own 7 other drills from 1/4"" to 1/2"". I have powerful, and not so powerful drills. Variable and single speed drills in several brands and price ranges have found their way into my shop. I use this drill most of all. I build furniture as a hobby. I originally purchased the drill for work in tight spots. I have found myself reaching for it to drill holes; drive screws and just about everthing else. I have found this drill to have plenty of power for 95% of the jobs I do. This is a great little drill if you do not need a cordless."
5,"exactly as it says: ""close quarters""","Milwaukee, again, has produced a superior product. The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters, although I use it for a lot of different applications. The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill. It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise. It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down. Ever. It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot. In no way is it limited to tight quarters."
5,Very useful tool,"I purchased a used, Milwaukee close quarters drill motor approximately 16 years ago (I call it a right angled drill). I have found this tool to be invaluable. I am an industrial electrician, and over the years, I have done quite a bit of residential wiring. There were plenty of times, that I would run into tight spots while drilling a hole through studs in the attic, and a standard drill motor just cannot fit in these tight areas, my Milwaukee drill always pulled me through, It also has the power needed to easily drive a spade bit through two 2x4&#65533;s stacked together. The only way that I would put it to rest, is to buy the same type in a cordless, and even then, I think, I will still always carry it on the job with me. After all, it came in handy as a backup when, all of my batteries died. It is a must have tool for several different construction trades as well as the weekend DIYers.Debbie from Wayne, Michigan&#65533;Proud to be an American&#65533;"
2,Use GREAT caution!,"This little monster might not have enough power for lots of heavy drilling, but it has more than enough to make you very, very sorry if you are foolish enough (as I was) to forget to unplug it before you change a bit. It took off at full speed, the cord wrapped around the paddle trigger, preventing it from turning off, and the whole mess jerked from my grasp and wrapped itself around my left hand. When I was finally able to unplug it, I was amazed to find that my first two fingers were only badly bruised and not broken. I would have said that what it managed to do to me was impossible. Wrong. Painfully wrong.Look how close the paddle is to the chuck. It's practically impossible to change a bit without depressing the paddle. If it's plugged in, you won't like what happens next."
2,I love all my Milwaukee tools except...,"This is not a drill I use very offen, and I would expect that it would have lasted a little longer. While running in a screw, I stripped out the gears and now have a tool that will cost as much to repair as it will to replace. Also the paddle switch is not very well designed, for a drill that is intended for cramped spaces I would expect something that was less prone to getting bumped or caught up, also the drill continues to spin long after you let off the paddle. This drill is fine for drilling small holes in cramped spaces that don't need to be damaged, that's about it."
2,Cheap gears & a dangerous paddle switch,"I used this drill infrequently as I have a Hole Hawg for most of my hole drilling work. After using this light duty drill a few times, the gears started to slip. A few more times and the drill was useless. I do not abuse my tools and as others have noted, these gears are very, very light duty. Further, the paddle handle location and bit changes are just asking for a chuck key rip into your palm if the tool is plugged in. If you have this tool, UNPLUG it when changing or removing bits. If you don't have this tool, I recommend you stay away from it and go with a 1/2 inch drill instead."
2,Light duty,"I bought one of these to drill holes in joists, it lasted for 5 holes before the angle drive stripped out. Returned for a 1/2 in. which works fine. I'd recommend going for a Hole Hawg to start with if you plan on using it for anything but small holes..."
2,MORE POWER PLEASE,"I'm not sure where to start. Well, let me first say that I am somewhat of a tool afficianado. If its a tool I probably tried it once or twice. I love tools. Big ones, small ones you name it. Armed with a lifetime of experience I feel that I am an excellent judge of tools. This tool may look pretty, sure it can fit in the palm of your hand, but what really counts is POWER. This little tool just lacks in the rpm department. A man like myself needs his tool to get the job done fast. I don't have time to jerk around with my tool. If you're a woman, this may be the drill for you. But men like me deserve a bigger , faster tool."
5,Looooove it!,"Love it & love them! The lyrics are deep, interesting, & evoke all kinds of raw emotion. The vocals are superb some of the best vocals male or female. Their songs are beautiful & unique. It's refreshing & different in a terrific way. Perfect blend of melodic talent w/a kick of punk. They are amazing live too, if you get the chance go see them in person."
4,Vicente... still king of the rancheras,"It says alot about Don Fernandez that he still is the best the ranchera world has to offer even though he's been around for decades.His voice is still strong, the arrangements are just right, the lyrics are beautiful, and the songwriting is superb (thanks to Joan Sebastian).First ranchera album i've purchased in years. They haven't been particularly great this decade.Thank you Vicente and Joan for getting me to listen to it again."
5,"""He is the voice of Mexico,"" period","Ever since I was a kid, I enjoy his music .This CD is no doubt a good one, Karaoke, I can sing along :). I got the CD within a week, that's fast. Thank you guys."
4,Nina Shandler's Hellish Nell.,"Ms Shandler's style is off-putting. I applaud her diligence in delving into source material, but don't understand why she uses vulgar language. ""Arse"" would be acceptable if quoting someone, but not when it forms part of the actual narrative. I got half way through the book before putting it down in desperation. No doubt I'll finish it at a later date when my mind has come to terms with her lax style.As with all books made in the States that I've encountered so far, it's well bound and the paper is of good quality."
4,Great book...bad grammar,"I really loved this book and have read it twice. First bought it to read on the beach in Negril and devoured it in a day! My only complaint about this book is that it contains tons of misspelled words (Jimmy Hendrix?!?) and other grammatical errors. While not a big deal, this can be somewhat distracting."
3,Okay,"Bought this as gift for my husband. His reveiw: It was okay, interesting about Gayle Sayer's life but not extremely well written. It had little to say about his relationship with Brian Piccolo."
2,Worked great for a bit!,"I bought this unit to replace a Black and Decker Sand Cat that had destroyed the front belt roller bearing. The unit has tremendous power. The bad part is that it will not sand flush to a wall. Then after using it about 4 times, it just plain quit. I'm lucky enough to have the service center within 5 miles of my house and the power switch was replaced under warranty. Otherwise the sander will take on anything and the belt rollers have decent bearings."
1,"Thought I selected ""Quality""?","After reading all the reviews, and talking to fellow woodworkers, I thought the 1276 was the right tool to do the heavy duty panel leveling I needed. I got exactly one day of use out of it, when it quit dead! There I was in the middle of a job, on a weekend, had to go to home depot and buy the Porter Cable after all.Disappointed: Mike"
2,Poor design,"I use sanders in flooring to quick level subfloors. On average I use it about once every 3 weeks for 2-3 hours. For the first few months of owning this sander, it worked like a champ. However the forward balance handle kept coming off during the job and finally lost the hardware holding it together. If that wasn't enough then the wearplate burned off. I called the factory and they took care of this no charge. Within 3 months of use this one burned off again. I don't consider this abnormal use and called them again. They told me this is normal and I would need to replace the part myself at my cost. Not expensive but downtime on the tool if needed. Maybe design a heavier duty plate. It's the best belt sander so far but I'm still lookin."
5,Ugly Duckling is a swan,Nice and heavy - so it does the work for you. Works great on Corian and hardwoods. UGLY looking - but very powerful and easy to change/adjust belts.When I opened the box I thought this thing look heinous - but it's a real swan as far as ergonomics and use.
1,Horrible ! not for beginners.,"This is an example where some academics should not be writers, a good marketer does not make a good writer or teacher.The author writes in a very hard-to-understand language, Im not saying this just because my native language is not english - my english speaking friends have expressed the same experience with this book.You get the feeling the author is purposely trying to use as many uneccesarily elaborate words and expressions to show off his academic status, and he takes little time to explain things clearly and rushes by at high speed.This book is not for beginners of marketing! It would be more useful as refresher material for those with prior knowledge, or as a refference source.For beginners I would recommend either books by;Masaaki Kotabe 'Global Marketing Management' orWarren J. Keegan 'Global Marketing Management'."
1,Not this time...,"I love the series. It's very uplifting. But the only one I know of that can't release an entire season at once :(Never thought an angel would be passing the collection plate more than once during a service. I did pay for both volumes of the third season. Which was basically twice as much as it would cost me for an entire season of any other series.Sorry Monica, I'll wait 'til they get bundled up from now on."
4,Season 4 Vol 1 Touching,Continuing saga of Touched By An Angel starting off with a double episode featuring the recurring Green Family. Well up to usual standard and not running out of ideas. A delight for fans but a little disconcerting for new viewers who lack some of the background for the first story. Worth persevering though or start with another disc.
5,love this series!,"i love this series and am so glad that it is finally on DVD! to tell the truth, i wish that CBS would have kept touched by an angel going, even after 10 years-than we would have monica as the supervisior training angels! i have almost every tape and book to go with this series and now have all but the 1st vol. of season 3; and of course this volume. this is one great family show!!"
1,This is NOT Burning Stone,"I bought this knowing the track list was a little different than the superior Japanese import. But I received it and heard something other than the Ruins - Burning Stone I know and love -- this a different Ruins CD, Stonehenge. DO NOT buy this. Since I opened I could not return it. So I smashed it. If you have ANY sense of decency -- DO NOT buy this CD as it is NOT what it claims to be. Save your money up and buy the Japanese import instead. It will be worth it as you will be able to hear the REAL Burning Stone (it is worth if only for the song ""Praha In Spring"") -- not Some American's idea of Burning Stone."
3,Applause Gigbag,"I recently bought the Applause by Ovation UAE148-M Ukulele. This is considered to be a Tenor Ukulele. I also bought the Applause by Ovation MBAP10 Gigbag. It is a good bag with nice padding but unfortunately the bag is too short for the Ovation UAE148-M. Maybe the Mandolins are shorter in lenth, I don't know, but I was disheartened because the description also stated it was for a Tenor Ukulele. Maybe my mistake was to believe that since it was made by Applause by Ovation that it would fit an Applause by Ovation ukulele.If you are buying this Gigbag for an Applause by Ovation Ukulele be careful because it might not fit. The UAE148-M Ukulele is about 1 1/2 inches longer than the Gigbag. The depth was also a little tight. However, I am now using the Gigbag for a Fluke ukulele with provides much better protection then the bag that came with the Fluke and it fits very well."
2,Does not fit the Ovation tenor ukulele,The case is a nice case but it ABSOLUTELY does not fit the applause tenor ukulele. It is misrepresented as a Ovation Applause Tenor Ukulele/Mandolin case for the Tenor Ovation uke. Additionally contributing to the problem is that the dimensions for the uke and the case are backwards. The uke is a little longer than 29 inches and the case is about 27.5 inches.When they say customers buy the uke and the case together those customers are buying the case for something else. If they are buying it for a Tenor Ovation Applause Ukulele the uke will STICK OUT OF THE BAG by +1.5 inches (And yes I am a bit annoyed.)I'm returning the case and need to find a suitable one for the Tenor uke still. I wish it fit cause it is well padded and has a convenient shoulder strap.
2,Not for a laptop,"I got these for my laptop, since it is an ultraportable and has horrid speakers. These speakers were (believe it or not) worse. They distort sound significantly, and they seem to have such a small frequency response that the sound that comes out barely sounds like music. It is more like a very tinny representation of music.Even if you are only using these with an mp3 player, you deserve better sound. Save up a bit more and buy a Logitech speaker system."
1,Terrible speakers,"These speakers are absolutely horrible. Absolutely zero bass, and if you turn the volume up to a point where you can actually hear the music, the speakers start to crackle. Not even that good of a bargain either. There are plenty of speakers sold on this website that are the same price if not cheaper that have a thousand times better sound quality (i.e. Audio Source DB5 Portable Powered Speaker System). The only positive is that these speakers are extremely compact, but other than that i can't think of one. I returned these within a week of purchase."
2,terrible for anything outside of listening in quiet envinroment,"i was willing to give these a shot...i dont use batteries, i hooked it up to an adapter i had for power. I cannot even turn them up loud without the sound quality being awful. I only use them when going to bed and want to hear my ipod as i drift off to sleep, or when taking a shower. Would not recommend...and they dont work without power...MUST use batteries or adapter."
2,surprised at how bad they are,"I got these for work, because I want to listen to my MP3 player, and sometimes I am in an area with no AC power. Since these can use batteries they appeared to be just what I was looking for. I didn't expect great sound, but I was still surprised by how bad the sound really was. Take a pair of headphones, plug them into your MP3 player or whatever, set them on the table and turn the volume up. That's kind of how these sound.I was in a hurry to get some speakers and didn't do any research on them or what my other options were and I am now regretting it. I consider these to be a waste of $30."
4,Well written and engaging,"Unlike a lot of cookbooks, this was a delight to read. I find Deborah Madison to be a good observer, and the subject matter benefits from her keen eye--and ear. She certainly finds creative ways to exploit the typical farmer's market fare. The only significant flaw with this book is that Ms. Madison simply tries to cover too much ground--literally and figuratively. Many of the ingredients are obviously regional in nature and availability, and are therefore beyond the reach of many readers. Still, this is a finely crafted volume and the author should be commended for elevating the subject matter to a very high level. Well done!"
4,Great Cookbook! And really fun to read,"I purchased this book after reading about it in Barbara Kingsolver's ""Animal, Vegetable, Miracle"" I shop at our local market a lot so I thought this book would be helpful. I LOVE reading Madison's stories and I agree with her advocation of local markets. This book is great for figuring out what to do with veggies when they are in season. The book is arranged by type of food for example - Greens, Nightshades, Stonefruits, which is both beautiful and useful. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I do find this organization a bit confusing if I want to make a whole meal. For example, the soups are spread across all of the chapters, so you need to know what your ingredients are, not that you want to make soup - but this is often how we shop at the market, so I think it will just take a bit of getting used to. Bottom line - if you love your market, you will love this book!"
3,"Beautiful, but not for me...yet","I want this book to be for me. I love gardening and the farmer's market, but my cooking skills and ability to afford (or find!) many of the ingredients is lagging. I'm going to keep it and hope I grow into it!"
2,Other writers have done it better,"Am I the only reader that cooks that realizes what a fob off this cookbook is?Old Betty Crocker 1954, was more honest, she gave a ""Key"" rescipe and then showed the variations.This book has multiples of the same rescipes under every vegtable. HUH?My other huge objection is the french, cooking school multi pot rescipes, no basic cooking here. Have a house elf to clean up?So borrow a copy form the ibrary and then buy a copy of the older, but much more usefull ""Italian farmhouse table"" and then you can cook everything, with less pans.Also way too much name dropping, and using a book as an excuse to travel, very superficail stuff."
2,FLAVORS BUT NOT LOCALLY,"Sorry, but I was very disappointed by this book. It is way to general to be used where I live, and thus doesn't inspire me at all."
1,Loved it at first . . . but,"When I first bought this sander I simply loved it. For the price it was a great piece of equipment. But then came the issue of service. The screws that hold the sanding base onto the unit have a tendency to come loose. If you do not keep these screws tight at all times, it tears up the base of the sander. In normal use, you don't realize the screws are loose until after you turn off the sander. I took the tool in for repairs and learned the design of the tool required complete replacement of the motor, an $... repair. I took the $... and bought the Porter Cable random orbit sander. It is more money but all in all a much better piece of equipment."
2,"WORKS GREAT, WHEN WORKING","I have owned this sander for about 2 years. When it is working, it is a great sander, much better than others I own, but in the time I have owned it I have had to replace the pad 3 times, and all the bearings once. This sander is not being used commercially, but in a home shop. Yesterday the pad came off again which is what happens when thay wear out, and this time it stripped out the threads in the hole that holds it on. I am sure if I checked the bolt every time I change a disc it would help, but when I pay $100.00 for a tool, I would expect it to stay togeather better than this. I'am not repairing it again. I am buying another brand."
1,2 ordered; 2 broke,"I ordered one and after 5 minutes of use, the mouse would no longer move the arrow on screen. I sent it back for another and the second one worked for 10 minutes and then the left button would no longer work. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
