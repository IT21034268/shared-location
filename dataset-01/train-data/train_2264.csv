5,DIVINE ATTENTION!,"This book was brought to my attention by a divine miracle. It was the end of 1999. Then I lived in London, UK. I had been reading a lot of books and articles which either dismissed the reality of hell or at best, rationalised it. One of such books was ""Conversations With God : An Uncommon Dialogue"". In fact, I was already sold, intellectually, on the idea that hell did not exist. Then it happened. Seemingly out of the blues, a friend of mine called me to say that she just bought a book which I just had to read. Prior to this, I never discussed my 'convictions' about the 'figurative' nature of hell with her, because she is a Christian. However, I agreed to read the book but never asked again. As if by divine appointment, she persisted. I then took the book and read it. The effect? Awesome! Thank the Lord Jesus for this book and for my friend, Joy, whom God used, I was otherwise a sure candidate for hell fire."
1,Hades sounds better,"Wow looks like Mary was digging for another story or just on some really good acid this time. Lets just say her book just found the scriptures very handy and she wasnt even really trying as hard this time. I think Mary should see a shrink and be very heavily medicated. Her books are strait Fiction in a wonderous and glorious attempt to make the common christian a ""HOLY ROLLER"" I have never once read scripture were Jesus calls anyone Child. She sounds like Jesus thinks she is from the red neck woods of Georgia. Grow up Mary stop bearing false witness. !!!!!! Stay off the drugs and do your homework MARY! This book was not worth the paper it was printed on and if heaven is like you say it is I DO NOT WANT TO GO and be any part of it."
1,Not true,"This book is alleged to be the direct word from God. It is nothing more than mere fantasy. Yes, Heaven is real, however, not according to the way Ms. Baxter alleges. I heard her speak publicly, and she contradicts in person what she has written in her book. Do not waste your time or your money on this or any other ""Heaven and hell hopper"" book."
5,Great Book,I truly enjoy this author and this book. I have kept if on my night-stand for years. I always want it close to hand so I can go back and re-visit the rich wealth of inspiration and testimony. Highly suggested.
5,Divine Revelation Of Heaven,"This was a gift for my wife and when she starts reading it, she doesn't want to put it down. GREAT BOOK."
1,BULL!!!!!!,I MUST SAY I WAS EXPECTING A LOT MORE THAN I GOT WITH THIS BOOK. IT CONSISTS MOSTLY OF SCRIPTURE QUOTES AND DECLARATIONS THAT GOD IS GREAT. I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE GOD I KNOW HAS ANGELS STATIONED IN CHURCHES WITH CLIP BOARDS RECORDING THE EXACT AMOUT EVERYBODY DONATES TO THE CHURCH AND THEIR ATTITUDE ABOUT THEIR DONATIONS. I WOULD HOPE THAT OUR EVERLASTING SOUL WAS DEPENDANT ON MORE THAN ATTENDING CHURCH SERVICES EVERY SUNDAY AND PAYING TITHING. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO TO CHURCH AND PAY THEIR TITHING AND SCREW OVER THEIR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS ON MONDAY.THERE IS NOTHING NEW OR REVOLUTIONARY ABOUT THIS BOOK OR IT'S CONTENTS. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!
2,A book of Delusional Half-Truths,"I read this book a few years back as a young struggling Christian. Even then a few things written I had to question. The book seems contradictory to the scripture in some parts. For example, when she saw Families in Heaven. Jesus stated that there is no marriage, or giving in marriage in heaven. I believe the author wrote a nice story based on a few Biblical facts mixed in with her own vivid imagination. I suggest a better book to read on the subject would be the Bible.I believe God has intended for us not to actually see what heaven is like, to such a degree until we are actually there. As the Bible states there are things ""Too wonderful for us to know"""
1,False Materialistic dreams-read the bible instead.,"I read this book, and I Find it absolutely outragous. the main things that tipped me off here is that she ""witnesses"" angels going to church services and recording how much people donate! Doesn't the bible say not to get caught up in earthly gains?so why would God care how much people donate to a church? why doesn't she also witness donations to orphanages or charities or deseise foundations?second, she starts talking about the things she see's in heaven:things like: ""it looked like the most beautifly carved ornate desk I have ever seen."" and the rest of these visions are just spliced together from scripture.No, her visions of heaven are nothing but false, materialistic dreams. do NOT buy into this. Pay attention to the scripture, yes, but do that from a bible.EDIT: I don't know why my first title was censored, because I used the word ""Fake"", not the other F word"
4,an eye opener,"everyone should read this book for a great eye opener. This could happen to you, if you are not saved."
1,The Cook's Tour,"First we were all treated by Ms. baxter's grand tour of Hell. Now, she's been to Heaven, too!! My, my, my. And the pathetic thing is that people will actually believe this stuff and put out good money for it. Where's the next trip? Purgatory?"
1,Paying for God's word!?!?!,"""For this purpose you were born, to write and tell what I have shown and told you. For these things are faithful and true. Your call is to let the world know there is a hell and that I, Jesus, was sent by God to save them from this torment.""There should be one more sentence on this quote. ""And to write several books about your experience in order that you make a nice profit and only people who can afford it can hear my message""Come on people this is ridiculous. Any person who truly thought God commissioned them to tell the world about heaven and hell would give away the information to as many people as they could reach. Without going into her many scriptural inaccuracies this should be enough for us to know who she is. A false prophet.""Do not put out the Spirit's fire; 20 do not treat prophecies with contempt. 21 TEST EVERYTHING. HOLD ON TO THE GOOD. 22 Avoid every kind of evil""-1 Thessalonians 5"
2,Beware of erroneous doctrine,"Ummmm... well, this book, some interpretations are not according to scripture. And well, if it's not according to scripture, than you might be reading (and believing) in something that's miscommunicated and wrong... the whole all babies go to heaven is not scriptural... Well, I guess it's up to YOU to pray about it and God to give YOU the revelation.P.S. Don't believe everything you read. Not everything is from God and right. That's why God gave us the 66 book bible as the ultimate resource to verify revelations like that.God bless.LW"
1,Painfully Bad Read!,"I finally had to put this book aside and it will be in the trash before the day is over. The writing is horrible and the message is plainly false. Please don't believe what this person writes. When reading this type of book, trust the feeling you get in your heart. This book made me feel dirty."
3,Heaven Is Real...,"This is the second book that I have read by this author and she is sharing divine insights given to her by God. The author paints a very vivid picture of Heaven. Scrptures are also provided. I highly recommend this book for the sick and shut-in. Patients that are terminally ill should be blessed and comforted to see or be reminded that Heaven is real. It is a quick read. The author may repeat some things too much, but give her credit for being obedient to God and trying to save souls."
4,A Fever-Dream Venice,"The art of alchemy is in the transformation. The third book in Lee's alchemically-based series set in a magical Venice follows this theme closer than the other novels in the series. It starts out as dark as imaginable. Feuding families, dark secrets, supernatural vendettas. But the novel changes, from a black-hearted to tragedy to a twilight-hued romance. The novel follows the fates of people involved in a particularly cruel prank-and all manner of comeuppance-not excluding forgiveness-is played out. It's a m√©lange of gothic horror, morality fable, and historical romance as only Lee can tell it. Her usual strengths are on display-fever dream imagery (""The eels leapt through the lagoon, like silver whips, fracturing the mirror-moon...""), erotica, devilish twists of fate and the odd historical anecdote. It is a bit more phantasmal than usual, but that's hardly a sin."
5,THE #1 TRAPPER OF THE YEAR!!!!,"Every song is a hit, this is one of the few cds i've ever owned that i listen to every song every time i pop in the cd. If u are from the south this is a must buy."
3,Original Sound Re-Issues,"This is pretty much a re-hash of previously released titles. Although the songs are a good mix, the quality suffers, as has been usual on their issues both on vinyl and CD. If you don't have the titles and want them all together on 1 CD, it's not a bad choice. But most are available on other CD's, with much better quality."
5,For piano playing fans of Beethoven's symphonies.,"I bought this book as a result of listening to the performance of it on CD. I have always enjoyed listening to Beethoven, and his symphonies have retained a place on my shelves for years. However, being a pianist, I never had a chance to actually play them. The way Liszt transcribed Beethoven's works onto piano is astounding, as he writes in a very natural way. There are, of course, some details of certain harmonies left out, but the overall impression remains remarkably similar. I look forward to being able to purchase the next book of the series when it is released."
4,A Bootcamp Retrospect,"This Boot camp compilation is nicely executed for the most part. It succinctly includes most of the classics by Black Moon and Smif N Wessun, when these groups were signed with Nervous Records, along with tracks by the ""newer"" school recruits; O.G.C. and Heltah skeltah, when Bootcamp was reassigned to Priority Records. joints like ""how many emcees"", ""who got da props"", ""I gotcha opin"" ""bucktown"" and ""Leflah Lefleur Eshkoshka"" capture the essence of this talented clik as backed by Da Beatminerz, but some of the tracks found towards the end of this compilation really attest to Bootcamp weaknesses, as when inferior, outside producers take the helm. I would have also appreciated the inclusion of some material by the Representativz and Buckshot. Overall, though, this album encompasses the Bootcamp Clik's heydays during the mid-nineties and adequately showcases the variance of its ranks, and is therefore worth the purchase."
5,Love this DVD,"I am new to strength training and this video was just what I needed to get started. Easy to follow, lots of encouragement and suggestion to ""go at your own pace"". I started with no weights and am already advancing after two weeks! And the beach is pretty nice to look at whiile you are working out."
5,Great low impact video.,I used it every other night as I lost 30 pounds and regained balance that was severely impacted through the years.
4,Harder than expected,It's a very good tape but I am obviously really out of shape and find it more difficult than I thought it would be. I will continue to use it and hope to be able to finish it someday. Would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to get into better shape.
2,Exercise DVD,I received this DVD but was not particularly pleased with this. It was not my type of exercise DVD ... kind of boring.
5,"encouraging, positive, whole body workout","I bought this video when I was 49 years old. Mirabai is about 8-9 years older than I am. I love her style because she takes things nice and slow and I don't pull muscles or hurt myself. I have experienced noticeable improvement in my strength since I started working out to her DVDs. I was exercising 3 times a week for a while, but now I'm doing it twice a week. I can tell I'm doing well because I can carry two gallons of milk in one hand, and I used to only be able to carry one. She does a ""whole body"" workout... including weight bearing exercises that increase bone density... something important for my age group.If you want flash, pizazz and polished perfection, she might not be the instructor for you. She's more like a friend. She gives lots of encouragement and positive feedback."
2,definitely for beginners only,I am an active over 50 - so thought this would be good. But this video is for absolute beginners only. The moves are slow - slow - slow. The instruction boring. I bought two of these videos thinking they would be good for in home exercise - but gave them both away.
4,Fun and educational,"We are teaching our 2 year old english and spanish at the same time so we watch videos in spanish. I love how this is only in spanish so I don't have to change the audio options every time I put it in. Also, it starts right up instead of having to ff through 5 or 6 commercials and then get to the main menu. She enjoys the songs and will easily watch this episode 2X without getting up from her seat. Great video!"
3,not really happy with it,"I bought this dvd since I am always looking for spanish products for my 2 year old since we speak spanish at home. I was expecting the dvd to be a spanish production but is not, it just shows the dvd with a 'spanish' language track. While maybe my kid doesn't realize that barney's mouth moves different from what he talks, for me is a bit annoying.For the price, I recommend to search dvds that offer a Spanish language track."
5,"Great book, very helpful",This book can really help out the ones who want to understand an addict and figure out what to do (and what not to do!). Encouraging and informative.
3,Kansas has a lot of rocks,"This is like a Roadside Geology on steroids. The single-spaced typed list I made of rock stops along I-70 alone was four pages long. Most major roads in the state are covered in similar detail, including not only the rocks, but historical sidelights and local oddities as well. With it, you'll never be bored driving across Kansas.The reason I'm only giving it three stars is that, while it provides plenty of opportunities to collect, it gives you almost no help understanding what you get. Most formations are not even assigned to geological periods. Very frustrating."
4,Gimme lil' fun,"When the zany ""Oogum Boogum"" and ""Gimme L'il Sign"" first appeared on the top 40 charts in the late sixties they defied description. It was soul music but it was'nt Motown, and it dang sure was'nt southern soul music. They embraced it on the Carolina coast as 'beach music, but Brentom Wood worked out of L.A. . For lack of a better term I'll call it soul-pop, and boy howdy is it fun . This is a great collection that includes the two hits and a whole bunch of songs that should have been hits.You won't find the gospel drenched anguish that is the hallmark of so many other of Brenton Wood's contemporaries, but they on the other hand would never have thought to stick a roller rink organ solo in the middle of one of their songs as Brenton does on ""Gimme L'il Sign"". I call it soul-pop. I call it genius too."
4,Excellant music,I think this is one of the best CDs I own. I have been a Brenton Wood fan for years now
5,Brenton Wood's 18 Best,some of the best oldies i ever heard it is so smooth and mellow just makes you want to relax with a beer and listen to some tunes.
4,The bad news is good news,The bad news is that many of the songs seem to have the same melody. The good news is that it's a great melody.
5,A must view,"If you enjoy ECM recordings, this is a must view. Eicher's musical philosophy is on full display here. It is clear that his contributions to the recorded performances are every bit as significant as the artists' original conceptions. And the artists have little trouble accepting that. Nik Bartsch's Ronin is the most concrete examples. Eicher patiently explains his suggestions and the band members completely get it as soon as they hear it. It's a great documentary."
3,Jazz Musician disappointed by Video,"Hello my Friends! Do not buy this if you're into the ECM jazz scene. When I was in high school, a friend came over to my house with ""Solstice"" and ""Witchi-Ti-Tao."" I was hooked for life.Ralph Towner, Eberhard Weber, Jon Christensen, Terje Rypdal, Jan Garbarek, soon became my biggest influences. L Shankar, Nana Vasconcelos, Marilyn Mazur, Trilok Gurtu, so many great jazz artists on one label. This video is mostly about producer Manfred Eicher. His record label ECM and ways of listening to music. It's mostly Manfred in orchestral settings.In ""Sounds and Silence"" there's a nice clip with Marilyn Mazur, some Anouar Brahem, and a little bit of Garbarek in an orchestral setting. This is not the ECM I know. Peter Guyer and Norbert Weidmer paint a lop-sided picture of Manfred. I was disappointed with the video because I'm mostly familiar with Manfred's great work in jazz and world music and there's little of that in this film."
1,A waste,Overly simplistic garbage. The crucial content of this book could fit into a pamphlet. Buy a different book.
2,"Please release the entire series, not all of these collections.","I have a couple of the Lucy collections, and they are a lot of fun; however, they are random selections and Lucy's work deserves complete, season-by-season collections, with extras!"
4,Plenty of Outlets for the Price,"This surge protector is a great option for those building a low-cost home theater. Certainly doesn't have the weight of the more expensive strips, but this one does the job. You can't beat the price, which is the major benefit of this surge protector. Also, if you demand coaxial protection, this one has it built in.Note that once I connected this upon arrival, the surge light was on, but things are functioning properly so far. I will not hesitate to return if there is a problem."
2,Nice looking product but NOT true 4 GA wire,"For under 20 bucks this is an ok deal - but not a great one. same thing would cost $40-50 at a stereo install store - but you would walk away with true 4 GA wire.The same day I got this power cable in the mail I picked up a short 2 ft segment of Tsunami 4 GA cable from a local and reputable stereo install store to use as a ground off my amp and it is way more packed with wire than this ""4 GA power cable"" equivalent. The outer cable dimension is equal but the wire count inside is nearly 2 to 1.This cable is a rather cheap price in an expensive product market and typically you get what you pay for."
1,Not 4 Gauge Wire,"I measured the diameter of the wire inside the insulation and it came out to be almost as thick as a 6 gauge wire. More like a 6.5 gauge, but the point is it will not be able to be used in applications that require a thicker 4 gauge wire. I do not recommend using this unless you need 6 gauge wire, and this is even not quite as thick as 6 gauge. The insulation is the same diameter as normal 4 gauge, but is just much thicker plastic so that they don't have to put the correct amount of wire inside of it."
1,FALSE ADVERTISMENT,"this is not a 4 gauge wire,,the thickness,,, included the plastic wire,, yes its 4 gaugeif you stirip the rubber,,, oh its like 6 gauge or 8 gauge,,,FALSE ADVERTISMENT,,,i hate it when people give it a 5 stars and say ""yeah you get what you pay for""but this is FALSE ADVERTISMENT !!!"
1,I got Suckered,"The package said 4 gauge wire, what it was, was 14 gauge at best. I'm disappointed that they would lie about what they're selling instead of just telling the truth. I will NOT recommend this product or brand to anyone."
1,"6 G, but well insulated",Good wire if you need 6 awg wire. The fuse is near watertight as well. But still not 4 Guage so 1 star.
5,Very good book!,Dr. Weil makes this audio book interesting and easy to read. He gives much useful information. He blends traditional medicine with alternative medicine in such a way that you see the relevance of them intertwined. I even bought two more copies to give to my children!
2,This is just a repackaging of previous cd's,I love Dr. Weil's messages and teachings and would recommended this to anyone who is new to his teachings. But for someone who has listened to teachings within the last two years will find this repetitive.
5,Amazing! Never gets old!,I love this whole album! I listen to it all the time. It is truly amazing. A must buy!
2,not for hyosung,I ordered them because they were suppose to fit my gt650r and they do not fit. if your looking to use them triple check to make sure they are the correct size.
1,Panasonic DMR-ES10S DVD Recorder D.O.A.,"The machine arrived rather loosely packed. I could never get it to display the setup menu on the TV, nor could I get it to simply play an existing DVD. I waited on hold for over an hour on Panasonic's tech support line and gave up waiting for someone to talk to me. I've returned the unit to Amazon.com. At least all I lost was the return shipping costs. Since remanufactured means something went wrong with it the first time, you'd think I would have known better. You really do get what you pay for..."
5,Teeming Leeming,"Yes, Jay Leeming's work is like an agate - you've never seen one quite like his before. His poems and angles on the world make you think, ""Why didn't I think of that, why didn't anyone think of that?"" Like all brilliant poets, he shows us what we've always known, but never thought of. This the most fun I've had between the covers of a book in a long time.Bill Robichaud"
5,Beyond Coso : Internal Control to Enhance Corporate Governan,"Anyone who read this book when it was first published in 1998 needs to re-read it in the context of the Enron revelations. It is amazing how Steven J. Root's examination and explanation of what internal control is, how it should be implemented and what it can and cannot accomplish is exactly on-point vis-√†-vis the break downs in corporate governance at Enron, Global Crossing and others of their ilk. Anyone from business student to congressional overseer, who wants the proper framework for understanding and explaining these crises should carefully study this book."
5,One of best books on (internal) control,"Beyond COSO is probably one of the best, complete and most recent books on (internal) control. What interested me a great deal was that Root behind the masks of the committee of sponsoring organisations looks, metaphorically speaking. It helped me a great deal on writing a graduation paper on this topic."
3,Dabrye - Two/Three,"Dabrye takes a much more definitive step into the hip-hop world with _Two/Three_, his second album for Ghostly Interational. The MCs take center stage here, and Dabrye's intricate production takes a more subdued role. For instance, the thrumming darkness on ""Encoded Flow"" or the pinball machine of ""That's What's Up"" seem to get subsumed beneath the lyrics. The back and forth of ""Viewer Discretion"" and ""Get It Together"" melds the two much better, balancing the sounds with the dueling lyricists so that the three complement each other; ""Reconsider"" also works well. Dabrye shines most on his instrumentals, like on the bouncy ""Tell Dem"" or the mysterious, guitar-stabbed ""Jorgy."" ""Piano"" seems to have no piano in its whatsoever -- not that it's a problem with such a funky track. A little bit of something for everyone here..."
2,NOT REALLY GOOD AT ALL FOR BIRD WATCHING.,"These are very nice binoculars. But, when you watch birds either in flight or trying to find one in an are the field. The field of vision is way to small.The power is nice if you can hold steady on your object. But be aware the more magnification the more unsteady it becomes. If I wanted to have a pair for the glove box for an emerengy to watch a herd of elk or deer while driving and could stop by the side of the road and hold still, then these would be OK. For bird watching and even football games you need a larger lense at least 35mm or 50mm is better. This gives you more brightness and at dusk you can see much better. Dawn and Dusk 7X50 are the best. Don't get me wrong this is a great deal for holding steady on a bright day but will be disappointing for the most part in the field with limited light."
5,Love these binoculars!!!,"I love them!!! Saw them on sale and binoculars have been on my husband's wish list for years (I honestly never saw the need for them so when I pick things off his list for a gift they kept being passed over) so I bought them. Since Father's Day is so very far away and Amazon's return policy .....well, the less said the better, I decided to take them out and check to make sure they were okay. Okay? These are fantastic!!! I live in the middle of nowhere and I can see the deer herd move through the hills. Not only can I see them but I can now pick up little individual characteristics and tell them apart (yeah, I have no life-got a problem with that?). I watch the birds and see every little feather on their heads. Poor husband is going to get his gift and find them well broke in but a pair of Steiner binoculars will be on MY wish list soon."
2,Disappointing,"Maybe it's just my particular pair, but I'm very disappointed with the focusing mechanism in these Steiner binoculars. The focusing knob turns very stiff & has a lot of ""slop"" to it, ie, when you turn the knob too far, & you start to rotate the knob back the other direction to get the precise focus, there is about 15 degrees of rotation before it actually does anything. Not very effective when trying to view fast moving objects or getting that first initial view of whatever you're looking at.I don't wear glasses, & feel that the eye cups don't extend out far enough to be effective. It feels like my eyes are practically touching the lenses to get the proper view through the binoculars.The clarity of the optics are good for the price paid, but I ended up putting these back in the box & went back to using my old Zeiss 8x20s."
5,works just like you would expect...,"This organizer works great. Some mentioned that theirs arrived with broken tabs, etc. That was not the case with mine. Arrived in perfect condition and works great. It‚Äôs made out of fairly tough plastic so I imagine it should last a long time. Simple and effective."
5,Greatly improved my health,"My doctor's never diagnosed me with IBS, even though for years I had all of the symptoms. I was fed up with all the prescriptions that my doctors gave me, none of them helped and most of them made me worse, so I decided to order Heather's products. I was amazed how easy the product dissolved once I discovered that room temperature fruit juice, like apple or orange juice in a shaker jar worked best for dissolving the power. This is one of the best decisions that I've made for my health, after 2 weeks of using it regularly, I no longer experience the horrible stomach cramps and back and forth constipation and diarrhea episodes. Thanks so much to Amazon for having the product available, so I can earn bucks using the Chase card."
4,NTSC,"THIS PRODUCT IS FANTASTIC IN ITS PRESENTION AND MAY CONTAIN HAVE SOME GREAT FOOTAGE BUT THAT WILL NOT HELP, ITS IN THE WRONG FORMAT (NTSC) FOR ME, I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA AND WE USE PAL"
1,"Outside the USA, don't bother","If you live outside of the USA, don't bother buying this or anything else from Amazon. The amount of emails that I have had to send back and forth to track my items and receive a response which is satisfactory is unbeliavable."
5,One day I had a dream...Today I have this set,"This set only describes by one word SPECTACULAR, is the best film that i ever seen, and probably the best ever that i will see in my life.The book is beautiful, with photos and a little descrpition. But the movies are a home run. From the First innings with videos like ""short cinema"" across the middle innings with videos like a one-week-later-series-resume, and the final innings videos with interviews, and big post-productions.The memories are guaranted, and for last the price...90 dlls...FOR LAST I ONLY SMILEOnly one question WHAT IF MR. COSTAS DOESNT WRITE A POOR INTROTUCTION AND NARRATED ONE DVD WITH MATERIAL OF THE PREVIOUS SERIES IN OTHER WORDS, MAKE A VIDEO WITH PHOTOS OF THE 1903-1942 WS AND THIS WILL BE REALLY THE GREATEST COLLECTION"
2,"Buyer beware, World Series highlights are edited versions",Several of the World Series included on this set are edited from their original versions. The 1950 WS is missing 9 minutes and the 1961 Series is missing 14 minutes of content. This was by comparing them to the earier released Yankees World Series DVD set. Can not atest to the non-Yankees world series but these discs are edited.
3,Just curious to find out........,"has this set been fixed yet? Does anybody know. There were some reviews last year regarding content from some of the older World Series videos about missing footage. I would love to have this set but I'm unwilling to spend money on an incomplete production. If someone knows if this has been corrected, I'd love to know."
2,wrong cd for my computer,"I cannot get this cd to work on my computer. My granddaughter, who is very computer literate, could not get it to work either. I will try to get her to look at the ones I want before I buy them."
2,"Dark, but not bright","The first time I saw this book, I didn't buy it. Later regretting that decision, I searched for it and after a long time found it. I bought it, expecting a thrilling read about a disturbed teenage girl. The girl, Lisa, was disturbed, but the story didn't thrill me. I learned nothing new about mental illness, except that many times even adults handle the situation like children.(which wasn't really all that new to me before, I just never thought about it) Plus, three of the four girls involved in the story had similar names: Lisa, Elizabeth, and Betsy. Some parts of the book were interesting, but for the most part it disillusioned me. Don't rush out and get this book."
1,boring,i felt the book to be undeveloped and boring and i couldn't bring myself to finish it. not recomended
1,"Run, don't walk away from this book.",This book is terrible. Just terrible. There's nothing more to say.
2,No wonder our generation is so messed up,"Lisa is a drama queen who is losing her marbles. Her drama queen friends take it upon their teenage selves to give her some therapy. Because, of course, the parents and other adults just don't care and are willing to sacrifice a good young woman to keep their paradigm intact.Um. duh.Much like Go Ask Alice, this book glamorizes teen dysfunction and makes it seem, like, omigod, totally cool and out there. I read this as a teen and steered my own daughters away from these sort of books that portray mental illness as something adventurous or glamorous. It's not healthy.Make them read To Kill A Mockingbird instead. A good social message that won't goof up their head."
3,It was OK,"Lisa, Bright and Dark: A NovelI think that they book was interesting because of the point of view that it was written from. I also think that the plot line was well thought out.The cons of this story are that her parents' ignorance is a bit overdramatized. After a certain point you would just have to be plain dumb, or just negligent to the point of cruelty with your children. Betsy's schoolgirl crushes were unnecessary to the story and made it a bit childish. All in all it was a fairly dramatic book, but also enjoyable for a quick read."
3,"Lisa, Bright and Dark - John Neufeld","A story about Lisa. Sixteen, with the world at her fingertips. She's going slowly insane, but no one will listen to her pleas. This story is told by a friend of Lisa's, Besty. She tells of the adults who refuse to see the truth, because they are not strong enough to handle it. She tells of how Lisa's little group of friends do everything to help her. I gave this book 3 stars. I was interested in the story, but it was short and sometimes too wordy. This book is a one day read. It captures you, none the less, because of the characters. A good book for teenagers who may have a friend or who are that friend that needs help. The conclusion to this story gives a ray of hope. That there is hope out there. Books like this one are, ""It Happened to Nancy"", or ""Go ask Alice."" This book is written in that tradition. So, if you like 'journals', read this book and jump into the life of Lisa."
4,Interesting,"This book was OK, a little too short of a book for my usual liking. I liked the events in it which took place but I wish it would have been more from Lisa's point of view. Maybe they could have switched around a little more. Lisa was by far my favorite character and i loved how they portrayed Lisa's mental conditions. It's definetly worth reading though. So check it out."
3,A Look Into A Different World,"Lisa, Bright and Dark is a haunting true life look at mental illness in a teenage girl. Although it was a slow read, the realness of it kept me reading. I feel it accuratly depicted all characters...especially the want-to-be-affluent parents in denial...that happens more often than we would all like to admit. Overall I feel this was a worthwhile story...but I did find it quite tedious in a lot of places."
2,Good storyline; Flat characters,"This book is about a depressed girl who is trying to get help. When adults turn her and her friends away, her friends try to help her. The storyline is nice and realistic, but though Neufeld tries to give his supporting characters depth, they turn out extremely shallow."
4,Good book,"Lisa, Bright and Dark was an interesting book. I chose the book because I was interesred in Lisa's mental problem. Lisa, a high school girl, realizes that she is going crazy. When she goes to school some days she will have a ""bright day"" when she is in a good mood and talkitive. Other days would be a ""dark day,"" and she would dress in all black and isolate herself. Lisa's friends decide to have help sessions in their houses and begin to diagnose her. One of Lisa's friends Elizibeth, finds Lisa a doctor to help. Lisa encounters many obsticles including attempting suicide. I really enjoyed this book and it's good if you want a short book to read. You wont want to put it down, even though it seems to go on forever."
3,"This book was okay, but.....","Lisa, Bright and Dark was an okay book. It was about a girl, struggling with drugs. If you really want to read a better book about the same kind of thing, read Go Ask Alice, i read it 3 times."
2,"Dark, dreary, and just plain boring.","Hey, this book could have been a good story. The potiential that writing about a girl going mad is high, but there was something lacking. The characters seemed like flat little card board cut outs that give you no particular feeling when you read about them. Especially, Lisa. By the end of the book all I knew about her was what I already knew from reading the summery on the back of the book. And the story in general? There was not much to elaborate on. Girl goes slightly crazy, girl goes slightly more crazy, girl at her craziest. If your going to read a book like that, what you need is a little feeling. But this had none. Altogether a dissapointing book."
4,Read Reality,"Lisa Bright and Dark is the story of a girl named Lisa who slowly drifts into a world of craziness. Her friends try to get help from teachers, their parents, and Lisa's own parents; who stupidly don't want to realize what is really happening to their daughter. .... The book shows how cruel and cold a person's own parents can be because inside themselves, they are not strong enough to admit or to deal with the fact that their child really has a problem...it opened my mind and perspectives to new areas. It also opened my heart to help others, as her friends did in the book. I believe the book is very relistic, and true to the things that can happen when people refuse to accept reality...."
3,Not that wounderful......,"I thought I would love this book because I'm into this sort of thing, but I didn't. I just couldn't stand it. I'm not really sure why, it might be because I don't think anyones parents would act like Lisas, or anyone's friends would actually act like they did. Every person in this story just didn't seam that real."
3,No that was no nervous breakdown...,"That was a bad case of dual personality, and maybe even perhaps a case of schizophrenia. There was never a really good explanation to Lisa's prsonality changes or why she reacted the way she did. The book delivers a touching message in regards to the dangers of split-personality disorders, but reading this novel was like reading a story from a child's point of view. I wanted a little more out of the ending from this novel."
4,Years later...,"Recently, another book title triggered the memory of this one for me. And, I recall devouring this book as a teen almost 30 years ago. I remember intensely indentifying with Lisa inasmuch as I was feeling as though adults were very detached from me and nowhere near understanding the life of a younger person. This book also appealed to my interest in psychology, though I wasn't aware of it at the time. I highly recommend it!"
1,Ripped off and fuming,"One of the few Handsome Family cds I didnt have. Excited when it arrived soon turned to ash as the case fell apart. It was obviously broken before being shrinkwrapped as there was a piece missing. Loaded it on my ipod and discovered no titles to the tracks beside song1, song2 etc. I concluded it may have been a burnt copy. How do these people get away with this??"
2,Not What I Expected,"Unfortunately, I did not read the previous books in this series. That being said, I had a hard time following the story line(s) that were in the book. I read 287 of the 346 pages, and am undecided if I want to finish. I thought the main characters were Antonia Stonewright and Michael Langton (as suggested on the back cover), but I have learned more about characters apparently introduced in the previous books than I have Antonia and Michael.I highly recommend reading the previous books in this series before starting on this one. Fortunately I got this book at the library, and did not pay for it."
1,book lover,I did not like this book at all because I already know so much about the author was talking about. For me it was boring.
3,Eh.,"It was a quick read, and it didn't seem to be based on much of the show. The illustrations didn't seem to be the calibur of the actual show. It was funny however, and interesting. I would pick it up on a discount, or at the library, but I wouldn't buy it. Save your money for season 3 on DVD whenever that may come out."
2,a bad bad book,"This book was clearly assembled by people who never watched tv show and were working from only the most cursory descriptions of the characters and mood of the show. The show is all about subtlety and understatement and there is none of either in this book. Blech. Blech I say.WD40 for the Soul, on the other hand, is definitely true to the spirit of the show and I do recommend that one.(the 2nd star is for the centerfold of John Redcorn)"
3,Overall Boring,"As a huge King Of The Hill fan, I eagerly purchased this book. I though it was fairly boring, and only a few pages had me laughing, and just a few more made me smile."
2,HUGE LET DOWN,This album falls far short of being anywhere near the quality of vols. 1&2.Did they just need filler songs to put between the two good songs. if you are new to this collection please buy one of the previous volumes.This album is a disappointment to reggae music...but that's just me.
1,SAD,"RECEIVED KNOBS AND THE SCREWS WERE TOO SHORT. WROTE COMPANY, NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BACK.. TOO SAD. WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
3,Not the best book by Gish Jen,"Gish Jen is a talented writer but this is not her best book. Gish Jen's fictional world seems to have grown so much smaller. It's mostly full of babies and mothers and bourgois preoccupations. After a while, it kind of gave me a headache. She should broaden her world and outlook. The best story, Duncan in China, somehow misses the point, too. Who's Duncan? He's not a fully developed character which is a pity."
1,Utterly Repulsive,"Read the beginning of the story about the party for the ""children of color"" and how cruel and desensitinzed the author is, not realizing how revolting her premise is. Harvard has ruined this promising writer. An ugly thing, this book, revolting as a worm."
3,Read it because the author went to Harvard.,"The title story written in pidgen English of a Chinese grandmother was cute, but too stereotypical. It reminded me of the movie Joy Luck Club. I am also a 1.5 generation Asian-American like the author, but I must have had a different experience of the United States, regarding growing up as an Asian among a white society, that makes me hard to connect with the stories. Even though I studied Confucianism and East Asian History at Harvard, I didn't realize we Asians were so pessimistic and dour in our outlook of American Society. I did enjoy the last story of the professor and his young wife. This one could be made into a full fledge novel. I did enjoy reading the whole book because I could understand the author's experience in Cambridge. I gave the book with favorable recommendations to my younger sister who may connect better with the stories written by Gish Jen. Look forward to more books. JL"
1,Lousy,This is my second and they both were terrible. (I know - why did I buy another?) Thought maybe the first was just a fluke. Doesn't steam most of the time and spits water out.
3,Big & heavy does not equal good,"It's mediocre at best. Here are my problems with it:- It's too heavy, so that if you have a light ironing board, the board tip over.- It doesn't glide smooth on any material (tried cotton and wool)- Poor job of taking out the wrinkles, even with steam.- It takes about an hour to cool down, no exaggeration.- The thing is metal so the whole iron gets hot, not just the bottom.However, it does cost a fraction of the higher end models and from its looks it will last a long long time. 3 stars."
2,A very different sort of page-turner,"The stories are the stories and they don't change, but moving around the book is dreadful, you must go through one page at a time makig finding the story you want to read very difficult."
3,An interesting glimpse into our medical past,"This book is a good read not as a mystery, which is the author's primary genre, but as a look at how doctors used to practice medicine a century ago, and how they lived their lives. It's a fictional account of a doctor's life, and it's a bit of a soap opera as well. The author was a nurse before she ventured into writing, so she knew what she was talking about on this subject. I found it very interesting, although at times, a bit depressing."
3,"Nice fit, but clunky belt clip.","I ordered the pink one for my daughter's Zen sleek. It fits like a glove and looks great. However, there are two issues with it:1. It has a large metal button on the back for an included large black belt clip. There is also a lanyard, but it attaches to the belt clip. The FlexiSkin is great, but the beltclip is clunky and ugly. Better not to use the belt clip (but, of course, you'll make up your own mind).2. Zen Sleek will not fit into the docking station with the FlexiSkin in place. It is necessary to pull up the bottom of the FlexiSkin to use the docking station. Since the Zen Sleek fits so snugly into the dock, there is no cover out there that will overcome this problem. Not a huge deal as long as constantly stretching the FlexiSkin off and on won't stretch out its shape. If you use the interface cord array included with the Zen Sleek and don't use the optional docking station, this fit won't be a problem."
2,Not worth the money,"As other reviewers have noted, the flexiskin does fit well on the Creative Zen Sleek player, but it is waaay overpriced. It looks very cheap (and probably was quite inexpensive to make). Unfortunately, it is the only protective cover that can be found on the market for the Zen Sleek. If I could do it over, I would probably not buy this cover and just carry the player as is."
4,Good suspense read.,"This is a good book. Not one of the best, but very entertaining. Bay Butler has spent 6 years in prison for a murder she didn't commit.As she was railroaded into prison, she is finagled out. The detective who handled her case, is surprised to see her out. However, HE has always thought she was innocent.You are pretty sure who is involved in the conspiracy, from the start. You don't find out why until a little before the end. There are strong characters but I found the story a little to pat.But it will hold your attention, and fill some time. I did enjoy reading this book. But don't look for any surprise ending."
2,No Sanctuary,"""No Sanctuary"" opens with a new opportunity for Bay Butler to start her life over after being wrongfully accused of murder and sent to prison. She's fiercly independent, which does not suit her mysterious benefactor, a wealthy matron with a hidden agenda. Toss in a cop who has always had his doubts of Bay's guilt, and you have a mystery on your hands. Who is responsible for Bay's being sent to prison? And, what do they want from her now?The book was okay, but I wasn't able to become attached to the characters."
3,"Corrs ""A+++"", Amazon ""F""","I'd ordered the set and had the experience of getting a Region 2, 3, 4, and 5 set of discs. The second disc was defective so had to return the set for a replacement. The replacement arrived today and it is a Region 1 set. This is upsetting as I just ordered the single concert DVD disc assuming the set to be the non-American regions and this one being American). Amazon is really failing in its delivery of this excellent set & doing the Corrs an injustice with unhappy buyers.This DVD is what the 2nd DVD is in the set though more affordable."
5,The Corrs ROCK,"Is it possible to just say, 'THE CORRS ROCK""? prior reviews evaluate the poly.....WHO FREAKIN CARES.???? The Corrs provide an absolute perfect experience. HOT CHICKS....Great vocals, nice, well it's all nice. ."
4,Hawkwind - 'Chronicles Of The Black Sword' (Griffin),"Originally released in 1985.With illustrations of sorcerers,wizards,mystical places and such,I had a strong feeling that I was in for quite an experience.'Chronicles...' focuses on the tale of Elric,the main character of some of the Michael Moorcock books.Keep in mind that not only is 'Chronicles...' different from any other Hawkwind album but I believe it to be a concept lp.With tunes like the fabulous ""Shade Gate"",""Song Of The Swords"",""The Sea King"",""Elric The Enchanter"" and ""Arioch"",you can sort of get the 'vibe' of a past mythical time.The instrumental tracks are somewhat hypnotic enough to REALLY take you in,IF you allow 'em to do so.A well done,very superbly produced piece of work here.The band released a live lp from this lp's tour 'Live Chronicles' the following year."
3,Commercial Hawkwind!,An uncomfortable attempt to do a concept album based on the Elric books. How can you translate the books into under 40 mins?Ok some very commercial Hawkwind songs result. A lot of people love this album so as an easy way into Hawkwind it is probably great.Needle Gun is so commercial (Status Quo Hawkwind???) I want to smash the disc at times! I resist cos it's ok otherwise... but no more.
3,Command line in a nutshell,"I opened the box and immediately noticed that this is a -much- smaller book than the Panther edition. The reason? It's about command line Unix, nothing else. This is described as ""we've come back to the Unix roots"" and that this is consistent with other O'Reilly titles like ""Linux in a Nutshell"". Perhaps, but titling a book ""Tiger in a Nutshell"" and discussing only Unix terminal commands is misleading at best, especially since this is a major departure from previous editions.This isn't a bad unix command reference and it is specialized for the BSD Unix of Tiger. Just don't expect it to be more than that.If you're looking for a book that covers Tiger -and- the unix commands in a lot of technical depth, you may want to look at ""Mac OS X Tiger Unleashed"". That isn't in any sense a nutshell book (it's huge) but it has all the material that this book doesn't."
3,OK,I found this book to be about the same as all of the other S and T books out there. It is a fine book.
1,deceptive promotion,They did not send me this shoes and they said me that is imposible to ship... I can not belive them.This is a deceptive promotion
1,Laken's Review,"I had high hopes that this would work for me but it didn't. From reading another review, I knew that this was a computer cd (not a cassette). This was fine but it made replaying the program more difficult. The program must be downloaded to your pc & then it tell's you a bit about Dr. Nagler and how the program works. The most important thing said is that you only have to hypotize yourself once (which takes about 45 minutes) for this to work. A lot of the program is focused on relaxation techniques & then Dr. Nagler states a few affirmations and it's over. I think that I need more affirmations then the ones given. I decided to do the program on a daily basis, hoping that it would eventually work for me. It didn't. I was highly disappointed and felt that I had wasted my money. It might work for others but I had no luck with this."
4,Good!,"I got this product for my eight year old, she is transitioning from child art products to a more adult kind. I thought this would be perfect. Crayon-like but not. I wasn't wrong. Add some canvas and it was a hit."
3,CRAYOLA? Don't think so.,"I just received mine. The photo shows ""Crayola"" and the description says ""Crayola"", but ""Crayola"" is nowhere to be found on the pastels that I received, in case that matters to you. It's strange that it is in the product image, however.Other info:* Oil Pastels made in Spain* Non-Toxic"
2,Water Solubility not good at all.,"As these are marked non-toxic, I bought these thinking kids would be able to use them for some fun face-painting. But looks like they barely dissolve in water and not much visible on skin.Good only just as normal Oil Pastels on paper."
3,"Great little tool, one vital flaw.","This is a handy little tool, well made and a good price. But it doesn't 'lock' onto a key ring, if both 'arms' extend through shaking or similar activity it will fall off. So beware or you'll lose yours like I lost mine. I don't think I'll be buying another because of this problem."
5,A little paranoia in this book is a good thing,"I suppose that a cool, rational look at the plot ""The Answer Man"" would show that it all very, very unlikely -- but who reads suspense thrillers for cool, rational analysis? This is definitely a book that keeps you turning the pages and which provides plenty of surprises. Almost nobody does what you expect him or her to do, and a lesson quickly learned is to trust no one. In fact, any character in this book must live by the rule that a little paranoia is a good thing, and a lot of paranoia is even better."
3,Columbo Style Protagonist,"Interesting story with a likeable protagonist, Ken Parker. Way too much of everything: too many characters to keep up with, too many twists and turns in plot, and way, way too many false endings. The constant ups and downs of the story get so out of hand it's difficult to keep the reader's interest."
3,A Page-Turner...But Dangerous.,"I might have given this thriller four or five stars, but I'm subtracting points for what I feel is a most dangerous feature: it actually gives a fairly detailed description of how to beat a lie detector! As interesting as these scenes are, do we really want to give criminals instructions on how to pass a polygraph exam?As the other reviewers have noted, it is an exciting, well-crafted story, but I find the author's lapse in moral judgment inexcusable."
3,Mixed,"This cd is pretty decent. I usually listen to hip hop but fancied something different and found this. The cd contains some great chill out tracks, the jungle brothers and ninety-9 being at the top of the pile. Overall i think it is a good cd apart from some misplaced tracks like elbow which i didn't really find appealing for this particular cd."
4,Long list of short songs,"Dick Clark definitely is the definitive authority to pick out a list of All Time Hits. This 60's & 70's rock compilation is crammed full of what are arguably some of the best tunes of that era. In fact, it's TOO crammed full of songs. They fit 21 tracks in 69 minutes and 18 seconds on one disc using ""short versions"" of some classic epics that really deserve full-length treatment. I always find it rather jarring to hear short versions of songs like Free Bird or In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. I gave this compilation 4 stars. This disc would have rated a 5 had it been a 2-disc set of full-length versions."
5,Thumbs Up,"This movie is great! I have it on vhs and have watched it for years but have been waiting for an official release to dvd but it hasn't happened. When I saw that Amazon manufactures it on demand I was skeptical, but I ordered it anyway and was not disappointed in the least. The quality of this dvd is just as good as what any studio would release. So if you're hesitant in purchasing this because Amazon manufactured it, DON'T BE! Purchase it-you won't be disappointed either!"
3,"Good movie, but bad production quality DVD","This DVD is ""made to order"", i.e., burned when purchased. It will not play on all DVD players. I'd advise steering clear of this kind of delivery and only purchase quality items from major studios, even if they cost a little more. It's worth the difference in production quality."
5,What A Gem!,"What a gem this film is! A true delight for the whole family! With lessons on morality, modest humor, and triumphant hope amid the struggle against oppression and despair, this film is a treasure to be watched repeatedly!The acting, writing, and direction are all excellent. The cinematography and location scenes are all beautiful! My only problem with the film is that its translataion onto tape caused it to jiggle on the screen. Maybe that's because the tape was used and old. I do not know. Nonetheless, when and if it comes out on dvd I intend to buy at least two copies."
4,Discovery.....,Was amazed to locate this book - it arrived in amazing time considering it came from the UK. It was perfect for the person for whom we bought it. They are totally absorbed by it.
4,Just a waring!,I'm not a Dr. but I thought I should warn people taking this everyday. This may be very helpful for a temporary urinary infection but I wouldn't take it everday of the year. It contains Uva Ursi which in the long term can effect your liver. I'm not saying it effects everyone but better safe than sorry. Check it out on Google(Uva Ursi side effects) or WebMD. Just one person's opinion.
1,not as pictured,"I ordered this item thinking the colors were as pictured and in fact the colors are Orange and Brown ,"
1,Great Promise Little Success,This book had such great potential and it was all just wasted. The Xenaesque nature of the main characters with the broken story lines and flashbacks which popped up without rhyme or reason. If this were food I would at least be able to get the bad taste out of my mouth but this book just sticks with you. Ughh!!! Better luck next time
2,A disappointing collection of fantasy,"The purpose of the book, as stated in its introduction, was to bring together ""good writing and good art"" from top-notch sci-fi/fantasy authors and illustrators. Each illustrator was chosen because his or her style seemed to uniquely fit the story he or she was visualizing.This may have been a great idea, but it just didn't work out. In my mass market paperback edition, the illustrations were all reduced to fuzzy black-and-white sketches. The stories themselves were either run-of-the-mill dragon stories or trite parodies. This collection barely rose to the level of mediocrity."
3,That's It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like this song a lot, but there is only one song on it, no b-sides or anything."
4,First Volume of the Pelbar Cycle,"It seems odd, but I really enjoyed the other books from the Pelbar Cycle, but had never read this - the first book in the series. It's a book I will keep around to re-read because it's that good."
2,Guess my tastes are changing.,"The first couple of times I read this book, I was just about as impressed by it as everybody else is here. Going back to it now, though, I find Kal, the hero, selfish and kind of shallow, and his unwillingness to discipline his child is hard for me to understand. For me, the biggest draw to this book is that it continues the story Early began in ""The Third Christmas""; here, the heroine is David's sister Erika."
5,Free & Clear,My home is fully stocked with this product due to allergies I have developed late in life. Keep supply at beauty shop also and others have found this product to be satisfactory. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.....
2,Free & Clear Sensitive Skin Firm Control Hair Spray,"Do not like the pump spray because you cannot control coverage, and I wound up with beads of glue on my hair. I also did not find the shampoo very helpful for my scalp irritation. The other products in the package were superfluous. I would not recommend these products for people who have scalp irritation."
2,these stands bite the big one,They are designed to wear out by becoming loose at the base. Unfortunately I speeded-up the process by pushing down on them to straighten the speaker. Tightening the screws at the bottom doesn't make any difference. Welding or Gorilla-glueing seem to be the only options. Who ever heard of planned obsolescence for speaker stands? Now you do.
4,Gift from me to my Mother-In-Law,"Having visited the place myself a few times, my wife & I accompaniedher parents on a couple of visits.M-I-L more than once expressed interest/desire to know more about theplace, complete history that led to its current-day status. She was bothsurprised and delighted.Recommend to those who find historical origins, developement, andevolution of famous places an attraction to know more about."
4,a great live but it still could've been better,"an excellent concert with dialogues with the audience but what was the use of changing the song order? The review included on the booklet tells you how it really was and the sound of the crowd confirms it. Still, it is pretty good."
4,Naked city- torture garden by Cristiano Canali,"I bought this CD in Milan and i have been waiting for it like 15 monthes but now I am a Llucky ower of this strange CD.It is carratterized by a very long number of songs. Very short sons but all of them has a different meanning. MAny of those tuches so many different kind of music thet it is amazing to think a such a various fanasy. All the CD is full of precious perls of music thanks by the superbus use of hte sax. The singer is goruious, no one ever before expressed such a noisy voice and sounds.In conclusion i think this should be one master piece of my collection and i suggest every-body to try to buy it."
5,"Great Job, Brian!","This book is very well done. He not only describes the problems in the American food system, but does a fantastic job of describing international problems, something that is lacking in many books published in the US. The writing is easy to understand even though it broaches some complicated issues. If there were any weaknesses, I think it's that he doesn't cover the nutritional losses of old food enough."
5,Pleasures Abound...,"This is required reading for everyone, not just farmers. It's packed with informative fact and real-life stories. A resource to aid those interested in knowing where their food originates (local is best) as well as how their food is cultivated. This book offers many suggestions to help readers find creative ways to support regional agriculture and a healthier lifestyle."
2,"Sloppy, unorganized, and boring","This was a book for one of my classes at school. I expected a lot going into it, as the topic should have been extremely interesting to someone who loves history. But the book is EXTREMELY boring, more of an outright listing of a sequence of events than an explanation of them or the circumstances surrounding them. It's also very sloppy and unorganized. Reid doesn't stay with any one person, region, time period, or theme long enough for what's he's writing to make sense; instead, he constantly jumps around, making it necessary to keep a separate, written list of people and places if you want to make any sense of what's going on."
1,Never received- never refunded,"I'm glad that Amazon reminded me to do this review- I never got this item, and was never refunded for it either. Guess I won't be RE-ordering from them!!!!"
2,Weak clip,Great idea but the material used is weak plastic. Mine cracked easily and is of no use. Not durable like the original one that came with the phone.
1,Stinker!! Beware!,"I bought this DVD based on a marketing email from Amazon. I was hoping it was from the amazing tour that just ended. What a mistake!! I truly feel ripped off. Ancient, grainy concert footage (most of it featuring the Dave Navarro version of RHCP). No actual complete performance of even one song. Really inane commentary from annoying british rock music critics. It all adds up to an experience that will suck the life out of you. Stay away!! If you don't have ""Live at Slane Castle,"" get that instead. You'll thank me..."
1,Exactly,"Everything everyone else is saying only multiplied by say.......one billion! Complete oppposite of advertised. Who made the British experts on American artists? And what's with the Fru-SHAN-TEE pronuniciation? Here's a clue, when in doubt, go with the pronunciation the person you're talking about uses. It really validates what you're trying to say. This video absolutely sucks. Unless you were in a coma in 1994 and missed the whole Woodstock experience, this will be your chance to find out what the Peppers were doing since that is all the video covers. I was forced to give it one star... I cannot wait to send it back."
1,Ouch!,"Horrible product - just a bunch of old footage with commentary by a couple of wankers. Stick with authorized, official RHCP products. This is a waste of time and money."
1,Interested in Woodstock or Navarro?,"Only spend your hard earned money if you want 3 guys opinions, Woodstock footage and to know about Navarro. I thought, like others, from the description that I was getting footage from the last tour. Gave it one star only because it was required in order to complete review."
5,Great compilation of greatest hits,"This is a great collection of Joan Armatrading's ""greatest hits"" which helped to fill out the gaps in my collection. Although this disk only covers Joan's work for A&M; Records for the period from the early 70's thru early 80's, I believe it includes ALL of her hits as I am not aware of any hits that don't appear on this compilation.Sound quality is superb, and the songs are as well -- hence the 5-star rating. However, the liner notes are inadequate (consisting of a biography and the original album on which each song appeared. There are no original release dates and no lyrics).Oddly enough, when ripped to my computer, the CD database registers this CD as ""Love And Affection: Joan Armatrading Classics 1975-1983"" with a release date of 2003. I'm not sure why this is ..."
3,Not the Berlitz method I remembered,"In the past I have loved Berlitz as a learning tool for languages, because after the English introduction, which explains the instructions you'll be hearing in a foreign language, the only language heard is the language you are studying. Unfortunately, this version included translations mixed in with the German. I found this to interrupt the natural flow of the language, as well as to defeat the purpose, which is to learn language in the way most young children do....by listening to the new language and figuring things out based on context. I was disappointed. Berlitz is still far superior to some other methods, but I preferred their previous method."
5,Gorgeous dress!,A wonderful dress. Beautifully made. A very beautiful item which I will recommend to anybody who likes top-quality objects.
5,Instant Classic,"Personally, I think this is the most exciting Pollard release since ""Speak Kindly..."" and certainly one of the high points of the Fading Captain Series so far. Although there are no fist-pumping rock anthems here, there's also no plodding acoustic dirges, no embarrasing experiments and nary a weak track on the whole damn thing. It has a very upbeat feeling and WARM sound to it. Something about the Aiport 5 albums strike me as a bit cold and metallic, and they make me feel like I'm listening to Pollard sing poetry over music he's hearing for the first time. This, on the other hand, sounds completely organic and natural, as though the beautiful instrumentals were tailor made for some classic Pollard melodies. Oh wait, they were! Kudos to Mac from Superchunk. I now have the soundtrack to my summer!!"
5,superchunk meets guided by voices,"what would you expect when two of indie rock's undisputed champs converge? well, what you get is a collection of slightly off-the-wall pop made timeless by the fact that this record was conceieved via the US mail and mac and bob never sat down in the studio together. given that, this album is a miracle and a gift to all who love indie rock. thank you. may i have another?"
4,The Hammer of the Sun,This book was in excellent condition for being a used paperback edition. The quickness in receiving this item was great. As well as the book being wonderful. I have the previous books to this series and was happy to finally have the final book. Thanks
1,Never Received this item,"Although I ordered this item on February 6, 2007, I have not received it to date and it is March 25, 2007. So, if Amazon has the courage to ask me to write a review on this item, then have the courage to write this.... Unfortunately, I'm still WAITING to receive my CDs... All 4 of them."
2,Pretty gross,"I didn't like them, they tasted cheap and were difficult to chew. I would not suggest buying them."
2,"Looks Great, Completely Useless","While this product looks fabulous, it is completely inadequate for use as a double towel bar. I wouldn't trust it to hold two washcloths at the same time. Once mounted, the unit leans whichever way the bars are facing. It is a poorly designed product, unstable for actually holding two towels on it. I had to return it."
5,JUST LIKE MY SICILIAN GRANDMA MADE,This book is excellent if you are looking for recipes that your Sicilian Grandmother or mother made at home....recipes are easy to read and follow. Especially enjoyed the little stories just before some of the recipes explaining the history of that particular dish.
2,so far,i didnt hear da whole album but i heard drop dat solga rag. the video iz funny but they aight they not as tight and hott as ca$h money
4,Great Album,"Yo this is a great album dont listen to the first dude who wrote this>>> ""understanding that this does not represent the south"" just goes to show u what he know LOL he say it make u sad that this is how the south gets represent but yo da wild boys are from New York (East Coast) not south so all i can say is listen to the album and get ya facts right before u go dissin"
1,blokah!! blokah!!,"man this cd is garbage. i have never seen anyone hate publicly like this here in my life. they are a bunch of imitations of tupac and other established rappers. if they want to make a name for themselves have some good lyrics or beats, don't just straight up hate. so to you wild clowns i got 2 words BLOKAH!!! BLOKAH!!!"
4,It sounds good for me.,"They combine singing and a hip hop style, and their voices don't sound childish at all. It is music for listening, joy and dance, if you like.I bought this CD in Japan.The CD contains only three tracks:1. Sky2. Osaga3. Happy Drive -Test your Stuff-All of them from their ""Japana-Rhythm"" 2005 album.DVD contains two promotion video clips:1. Dreamland2. SkyAnd some Bennie K comments between and at the end of the videos. Running time: 11 min."
2,Not for the masses,If one can read through the author's interminablly sophomoric and condescending attitude(s); perhaps a nuggest or two of knowledge can be gleaned by those who can perservere. The commercial reviews are terribly outdated. This book is for those who have unlimited funding for building exotic telescopes and accessories. I cannot recommend this book and wish I had not read it so I could return it for a refund.
3,alright...,it has a lot of information but the diet menus are for only 185 lbs guys and there's no chart to calculate it for any other weight
2,Disappointed!,WHILE THIS BOOK DID HAVE SOME GOOD INFO I JUST WASNT THRILLED! WAY TOO MANY MEALPLANS! OK GIVE A FEW SAMPLES...NOT 75!! REALLY CRAZY! JUST BUMMED OUT WITH THIS ONE!
5,Men's Health,A good book with very useful and mostly new information. It's a massive book and well worth the price. There are a variety of week-long meal plans. Something to reference again and again.
3,Just alright,"Not a big fan, the color quality is better than the regular Crayola color pencils but sharpening is always a problem and the watercolor quality not great. I wouldn't buy them for watercolor use but for straight coloring prefer these to the regular variety."
3,great leds poor quality wood,The colors are nice and watercolor effect is nice. My only concern is the wood does not seem very good so they are hard to sharpen.
4,Lifting your sermon out of the doldrums,"I question whether the first reviewer read the book. Miller specifically lists Tim Timmon's three handicaps of the Narrow-Walled Sermon -- on page 19 no less! First handicap: The temptation to present the quick fix. Second handicap: The church has gotten used to talking to itself. Third handicap: The preacher tends to preach only to those who own the church. One of his main points in this section is that most congregations are preaching only to themselves -- not much room for growth or challenger there!A memorable quote from the 1st chapter: ""The church seems more content to die inside than preach outside.""While I decry Miller's non-inclusive language -- and may not agree with everything he puts forth -- this book is full of meat for any preacher desiring to strengthen their preaching."
5,A touch of Ireland,This album is a must have for anyone who really loves music. You could listen to it all day!
1,"Extreemely nonesensical book,","This book is the worst book I ever read. Please throw it out. Pl author do not write further, you are no good,as a writer and your scholarship is next to nothing"
1,For beginners only!,"I'll make this real quick. This book is basically a re-hash of existing material written in greater depth by others, such as Zechariah Sitchin's series of books starting with the ""12th Planet"". This book really isn't even good enough for beginners on the subject, as the author jumps from subject to subject with little continuity. This is at best an appetizer for the main course."
5,Definitely Worth Reading,"All of the ""For Beginners Only"" reviews not withstanding, this is a good book. I personally am as up to date on most other writers in this genre as anyone else, and I could not put this book down. Overall, it's clear and concise, well researched, and well-written. The author does a better job of linking his theory to modern religion and mythology than Sitchin, in my opinion. I recommend it highly!"
3,Book is interesting but covers things that are in lots of other books already,"I liked this book but found myself skipping over lots of parts because they had been in so many other books already. There was not much original in it, but I didn't mind having my memory refreshed. There is not anything very earth shattering as relates to DNA either, I expected more from that and was a little disappointed."
2,Cheap,"The reason for the word cheap is that this book contains a bunch of summaries from other books and little of the authors own thoughts.... I used to do this trick in 4th grade to get out of doing alot of work coming up with my own ideas... Im 17, my dad got me this book and I regret that he had to pay so much for it.... It contains a lot of information that is verry difficult to apprehend due to jumping from subject to subject... But basicaly this book contains the summary's of many books.... I would rather read a book focused on one subject, not a book that contains the opinions of many.... Overall it was Ok."
2,Quality is hit and miss,"Out of a pack of six pencils, I had the lead advancing mechanism fail within the first coupe of days of use. The pencils that do work continue to function well with constant use. Overall it seems to be a production problem that lead to a few bad units. The erasers wear down far too quickly and the pencils only come with a single extra stick of lead. As a long-time clickster user, the brand seems to have taken a turn for the worse recently."
2,Mind-numbing,"I was searching for new cast recordings to add to my musical library, and stumbled across this one. It wasn't AWFUL, but it definitely was not really enjoyable to listen to. The lyrics are not really inventive, and some just felt so contrived and mind-numbing to listen to. There are some numbers that are OK, but I would not recommend this album to anyone."
1,Am I glad I'm not married to this guy,"Just what we need, another chest-thumping ""defense"" of male superiority. I guess we can never take our equality for granted--it must be fought for, sheroically, over and over and over again. If equality means anything to us of the female gender, it means we don't have to give this trash any power over our sense of self."
1,Bigotry disguised as scholarship,"Prof. Mansfield believes the essence of manliness is ""confidence in risky situations"". In other words, women lack courage. This is reminiscent of Larry Summers' view that women lack innate intellectual abilites. Is it possible that the essence of manliness is instead a strong need to feel superior to others? More female leadership--with all the compassion, humility, and collaborativity that it would bring--might be a very good thing for this world. I wonder why parents spend $30,000 per year to send their children to Harvard to be educated by these ""professors""."
5,Considering Manliness,I was spell bound watching Naomi Cambell interview Harvey Mansfield regarding his book Manliness. She is truly a gifted and interesting interviewer and I found Mansfield just as charming as she did. The conversation clearly exposed important issues from each of their perspectives. This form of dialogue is so rare in our meida. Both Cambell ad Mansfield spoke with honesty and clarity from their own understanding of this complex and poorly understood perspective. I could have watched more. This is an important book because it is generating such well considered and open exchanges.
2,"Disjointed, regressive, faux-confrontation","As much as I loathe dogmatic feminist crap, things like this book serve as a consistent reminder that feminists aren't the only ones drawing unnecessary divisions between genders. This book is essentially a myriad of idealistic non-sequiturs that is at best an adequate discussion-starter."
2,"REAL Men don't even READ books, let alone WRITE them","This guy writes a book about MANLINESS and he's a HARVARD PROFESSOR??? Can he clear brush like Our President? Can he talk about NASCAR? Can he change out the plugs on his pick-up? If not, he knows nothing of MANLINESS! Everyone knows that REAL men are contemptuous of books and the pansies who read and write them. You want MANLINESS?? Go to a bar and start a fight, then. Watch some sports on TV and do a sixpack and then another sixpack. Clear some brush like Our President.I trust I make myself clear. I'm MANLY. And I don't need a fancy pantsy book to tell me about it.This extra Y chromosome is driving me CRAZY!"
1,Meandering and Random,"This book is little more than a meandering list of obtuse, random literary references on the word ""Manliness"". I must admit that after the first couple of chapters I could not force myself to press on and read the whole thing. It is as boring as reading a train schedule.I did skim the book to see if the rest of it follows the same pattern of random references with no interpretation. It does.I did read the final chapter to see if the book comes to any conclusions. It does not.The idea for the book is interesting, but the book itself is full of padding and fill."
1,1 star for being outragious,"If you thought caveman thinking was dead, the good professor wrote this book for you. Yes what we need is some good chivalrous, knightlike men. Men who act first and ask questions later. Give me a break. The world is on fire because of ""manly men"".The book is funny though and I am sure will be enjoyed by the Powerline, LGF types.I guess women sweeping into the seat of power as CEO's, running government, the Supreme Court, local government, the military, law enforcement, the media has gotten Mr Mansfield scared in his old age."
2,Cliches hidden amongst boring dreck.,"Mansfield asserts that ""manliness"" is a personality trait best embodied in John Wayne movies, George W. Bush, and the a-hole jocks you knew from high school. His whole book is a meandering meditation on why we should worship such bossy, simple minded, egotistical jerks as the pinnacles of manhood, yet the examples he cites from literature (such as Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"") don't even support his own argument very well.This very shallow definition of what exemplifies a ""real man"" is rehashed and expanded upon (but never looked beyond) throughout a bloated, boring bit of pseudo-academic writing that contains some occasional insights amongst a vast amount of filler and mind numbing repetition. Also, there is a lot of bashing of feminists and liberals that, while sanitized for academia, really isn't all that far from what you might hear your typical Fox News panelist spew on any given night."
4,sexy and suspenseful,The White Horse is Dead is sexy and suspenseful! Resmine Atis is a star in the making.
5,"Yes, yes y'all&#65533;&#65533;better sharpen up your listening skills!","This is an album to sit with, cherish, and in the immortal words of Walker Percy, ""hand along for good and selfish reasons"". David Singer's lyrical offering is a mark and measure of the cruel radiance of what it is to be daring enough to live passionately aware. And lets face it, the shiznit rocks! Run don't walk to pick this one up!"
3,Pronunciation guide,"This dictionary is good as far as giving Spanish/English translations, but its pronunciation symbols for Spanish speakers seeking the correct English pronunciation would be more helpful if it used known Spanish phonics rather than linguistic symbols. Many users of such a dictionary trying to learn English as a second language have had only a basic formal education. Using new symbols only complicates things. I realize that using the Spanish alphabet's symbols is less precise for some sounds, but at least this would help the learners approximate the correct pronunciation. This is a the opinion of a bilingual, bicultural former elementary teacher who has tried to help immigrants learn basic English."
4,The most complete preparation for the HSPT/COOP period.,"Let's set the record straight with this test prep guide for the HSPT/COOP - It is, by far, the most comprehensive HSPT/COOP preparation guide out there. I own a test preparation and tutoring company and I have seen all the major guide books out there for these exams. This is the book I use. And I'm not even a big Barron's fan - I don't touch their books for the SAT, or any AP exams. But for the HSPT, this is the one to go with. It has an absolutely ridiculous amount of exercises and practice questions dealing with every potential topic you may come across on these exams. You could work in this book for a year and not run out of material. It's almost disturbing considering it's a test guide for 8th graders. Sure there are typos and the layout is horrible, but the actual material, not to mention how closely it resembles the actual exams, is unparalleled."
2,Makes preparing for the test a real headache!,"My 13 year old son used this book to prepare for the COOP exam. The plus side to this book is it has ""diagnostic"" tests so you can quickly identify strengths and weaknesses and then zero in on the chapters needed to improve your grade. There is a ton of practice questions and hundreds of mini exams on each subject covered on the test. The book also includes 2 full practice COOP as well as 2 full practice HSPT exams. The book however, is ruined by very poor explanations on exam answers and no explanation at all on practice answers. The worst part is the answer key on many of the tests appear on the very same page as the last few quesions, so in other words, it's nearly impossible to take the tests (especially the diagnostics) without seeing the answers. Finally, the book contains at least 10 errors that I found and there might be more that I didn't realize. I would expect better from a name like Barron's. Great idea, poorly developed book :("
1,Wrong References,"I liked the book exept for the fact that George Fowler makes references to the Bible that are not so. For example on page 89 he says that in Corinthians(12:2) that paul heard things in meditation that ""man is not permitted to speak"" which in fact is not even in the Bible. Am I the only one who noticed this?"
4,gave me nightmares!,"Sugar takes risks and is smarter than so many other such indie projects that boast that they have something to offer. Horror fans, serious filmmakers and those who really like a challenge should take a look. Stylish and interesting, the gothic idea hits its mark as Golden convincingly incarnates a woman who is some steps past the verge of a nervous breakdown. The absence of dialogue and linear narrative adds to the nightmarish qualities of the work which most viewers should find refreshing. Imaginative and unsettling, Sugar packs the punch!"
1,Sugar,"Simply put. Don't buy. It has ""NO"" storyline. You can't guess what's going on, because she says nothing, through out the entire movie, to include answering the phone. The ""only"" other character in the movie is a dead girl. It bounces from black & white scences to color. Their's no noise. It's a silent movie for you to draw any kind of conclusion. If you have a ememy, send them a copy."
2,not recommended,"While he does have some great songs, listening to 29 different 2 minute badly mixed bad sounding live tracks just isn't worth it. I'm sure it was a good show, but did not translate into a good live album, with the sound not up to par at all."
1,From a Manu Chao Huge Fan,"Don't bother buying this album, even if you're a big fan, like me. It starts well, with the great simple mellow rythm that Manu Chao has. But as soon as the second song kicks in (apart from the intro) you're bombarded with screaming backing vocals and metals, in a ska-like rythm. So far so good. BUT IT KEEPS ON GOING! Till the very last song. This is not at all like the studio albums."
1,I should have listened to the other ratings...,"I like Manu Chao, but I did not like this CD. If you are looking for the song 'Bongo Bong' (or any other particular Manu Chao song you may like) don't bother with this CD. All the songs are drowned in 'hey, hey, hey, hey'. If someone had played this version of the song for me, I would not have guessed it was the same song - it's that bad. Now I finally understand what my high school english teacher meant by a 'cacaphonous din'..."
1,"come on, people...","i've read all the previous posts, and i'm shocked that no one has said a thing about the editing and mixing.i mean, come on. if you listen to this cd straight through, it doesn't make sense. if someone cut two minute snippets of twenty-nine songs and stuck them all together with masking tape, it would sound like this. songs don't start or end; jarring random cuts happen mid-song.someone keeps bumping the jukebox, but you don't hear the needle scratch.which might be cool if this wasn't a LIVE ALBUM. being a live recording, these cuts affect the sound of the audience as well. large crowds of people do not sound like this.listening to this cd in my car made me mad enough to get off my butt and figure out how to post a review. and i like manu chao. whoever assembled this live package shouldn't be allowed to work with recordings again. this album is easily the most unlistenable thing i've heard in years."
2,"Good coffee, but mechanical problems","I loved this coffee pot at first. But after some time, it became irretrievably stained. And the clock stopped working--it ran fast continuously, making it impossible to know the time or use the timer to make your coffee in advance. It still made great coffee, but overall I was annoyed by all of the problems."
5,"Descriptions and photos are accurate, why are buyers surprised?","It seems both the photo and the description describe the item accurately. My daughter has this and lots of other Haba food and loves playing with them. I can't figure out why many reviewers are surprised by the size of the foods, the size is given in the descriptions. Haba products are great and of very high quality. I wouldn't hesitate to buy anything they make (and no, I don't work for them)."
4,Inexpensive with good features,"It has good design, a little fragile but it's inexpensive so this is not to be unexpected. Nice rubberized grip at the tip, with convenient finger activated lead advance. Large eraser that as it wears out can be extended with a simple twist of the end of the pencil. The eraser is about an inch long in total.Side note: I got mine through Office Depot. There was no packaging except they put it in a plastic bag. Of course it was broken during shipping. It took a week to get it re-shipped. It was also just put in a plastic bag. Luckily, it was not broken this time. I don't know why they don't wrap it in a little bubble wrap."
5,Clear Point Mechanical Pencil,"THIS IS THE BEST PENCIL i HAVE EVER USED, iT IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND IT HAS A CONVENIENT TWIST ERASER AS WELL AS SIDE LEAD ADVANCE SO YOU CAN WRITE CONTINUOUSLY WITH OUT HAVING TO STOP TO ADVANCE YOUR LEAD. GREAT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS!ESPECIALLY FOR MATH CLASS IT HAS A NICE LARGE ERASER THAT DOES NOT LEAVE MARKS ON YOUR PAPER -AWESOME PENCIL."
1,Genuine Mistake or Ripoff,I just received the package but found only 1 pencil thrown in a sealed bag instead of a box of 12 pencils. Filed a complaint and hoping it was a genuine mistake on the sellers part.I based my buying decision on the title and description of the product (of course along with the picture of the box) which clearly states 12 pencils.
4,Informative book on the leading sf magazine of 1929-1934,"This book consists of interviews with many surviving authors and editors of early 1930's science-fiction, specifically those appearing in Science Wonder Stories, later Wonder Stories. It contains valuable information on an often overlooked aspect of science-fiction, i.e., Hugo Gernsback's continued domination of science-fiction after losing control of Amazing Stories."
2,impure daughter of Bolena,"The words are ""vil bastarda"" - have bought 4 DVDs, none says it - not one! Is this 2011 or 1520? Sung well enough I guess, not especially tense, shut the damned thing off after she said (not screamed) ""impure daughter of Bolena"". What a rip!"
4,New killer album,"David bowie made another solid and good album.it grows on you with every listening,it seems not as satisfying in the begining.""New Killer star"" and ""Never Grow Old"" are just marvelous,other songs are maybe not as amazing but solid too.Bowie rocks with style although he is in his middle 50-ties.the music here is quite mixed""Looking for water"" or ""loneliest guy"" are very personal tracks with moving lyrics,""New killer star"" has massive industrial chorus,""Bring me to disco king"" is groovy jazz song and ""Pablo picasso"" is alternative rocker.Bowie is still great artist.maybe he makes not genius albums as in hte past but still much better than many things that are coming out this time.really satisfying music that you must listen with open mind.ps.The bonus tracks are nice - especially heavy ""Fly"" and new version of his hit ""rebel rebel"".a good addition to his discography."
3,A missed opportunity,"This is a good album. Not as good as Heathen from a couple of years ago, but very good nonetheless. I got someone to bring it back from the USA, as Dualdisc hasn't yet been officially released in the UK. Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's a good surround mix, and at least I can play it in my car and rip it to my iPod, unlike normal DVD-A. But what a missed opportunity to only have the surround side in Dolby Digital. There's plenty of capacity on a DVD to incorporate both a proper 96 KHZ 24 bit 5.1 DVD-A version of the surround mix, as well as a standard DD version. And good as it is, the surround mix doesn't sound as natural, vibrant or crystal clear as a good high-res audio version would have. I hope future Dualdisc releases incorporate proper DVD-Audio surround mixes."
3,Reality Bites,"I loved Bowie's HOURS and HEATHEN so I was anxiously awaiting REALITY. My first listen didn't go well. I didn't care for the disc at all, but decided I'd give it more time to grow on me. And it has, but not by much. I enjoyed the melancholy tracks ""The Lonliest Guy"" and ""Bring Me The Disco King"" the best, but none of the upbeat songs stayed with me. I'd list this as his weakest effort in awhile. Still, it's more interesting than most performers these days.As for the bonus disc, the remake of ""Rebel Rebel"" is the best, but I prefer teh original and don't see why the remake was necessary. I would have rather heard a completely new track. ""Fly"" and ""Queen Of All The Tarts"" follow the mold of the main album and are not that memorable. I suggest buying the regular version of the album if you're not a Bowie completist."
4,So-so for Bowie,"But after all it IS Bowie, so it's still better than most.Three very good songs and one great. Rebel, Rebel is one of the very good songs.There are selections (note plural, perhaps 4) that I wouldn't listen to again by choice. I've never cared much for Bowie as a crooner.FYI my favorite Bowie is ""Outside"", so ignore this review if you really, really liked ""Hours""."
2,Reality Sucks,"One of Bowies lowest . Hours and Heathen much more interesting and with the desired twists . It's all a matter of taste , timing and the moment of ones Reality . Too hipped and so it goes . I'll wait for the next one , surelly called Fantasy ..."
5,Excellent,"Excellent fun workout,easy to follow, invigorating, puts pep in your step, really loosens up the entire body, allows you to learn and go at your own pace."
2,I was disappointed...,"I bought this video because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. However, I thought it was difficult and too high impact for me. Most of the moves were confusing. Hemalayaa makes it look really easy and I'm sure it is...for HER. However, for someone overweight like me, the some of the moves are quite near impossible. The cool down was alright but overall, I wasn't a fan."
3,Too Slow,The video was too slow for a dance workout. I highly recommend the other two if you want a good workout and dance moves.
3,Fairly Decent Work out not enough Bollywood Moves,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this DVD since it has workout in the title. It turned out to a be very typical of a dance workout DVD. The dance moves are so/so as is the workout, but if all you are looking for is a moderate work out with a fun change of pace. This one is definitely for you!"
1,it's just ok,"This workout does offer some cardio benefit. It also does introduce you to some basic Bhangra steps. It is not a serious workout or dance video. I wouldn't buy it just ""to mix up my workout""."
4,A lot of bang for your workout effort,"I tried this workout video to get some variety into my workout.In the warming up section, I thought I wasn't going to get much of a workout. I was wrong -- it got my heart pumping and was fun enough so that it wasn't too much like hard work. This automatically makes me like it a lot.I also love the interesting background setting, and the music was just right -- bollywood, but not *too* exotic. Hemalayaa looked like she was having fun and it's infectious. It was also a sexy little workout, no moves were impossble, but being unfamiliar with them, I felt uncoordinated and sometimes found it a challenge to keep up.I also liked the fact that the object of each workout segment was well identified. It was organized similar to a Denise Austin workout, that you were working out different areas of your body.This workout definitely kept my muscles guessing."
1,"Not fun, pointless","I thought I would check this out from the library before buying it and am glad I did. It was boring and silly, nothing like what I was expecting based on the rave reviews."
2,Disappointing - Not What I Thought,"I tried this dvd because it looked different and fun. However, I was hugely disappointed. It looks like an amateur video off You Tube! There is minimal direction besides: ""Shake your hips, do it with attitude!""It just played like someone grabbed a camcorder and said: ""Start dancing Hemalayaa!"". I ended up returning it for a partial refund."
2,Disappointing workout,"I bought this workout video based on the user reviews - while the instructor does go over a series of good Indian dance moves, the instruction leaves a lot to be desired and individual moves are not broken down into their component parts at the height of the workout. There is little notice given before switching moves and I often found myself left behind and unable to follow the instructor. I would not purchase anything by Hemalayaa again."
2,"Not so good, not so hot, don't burn much",It's cool. But you repeat the same moves all over.I don't even know if i burned !!!!I don't like it that much
1,Had better workouts!,"After buying this workout dvd based on such high reviews i was very disappointed! I was hoping for a little more ""bollywood"" action in the moves, as I have taken many bollywood classes. This DVD does not compare to an actual bollywood workout. The cool down period was the best part of the dvd. If you are looking for an intense workout, skip this dvd!"
5,Awesome!,"I rarely review items but this workout is so sexy and fun, I felt compelled to spread the word! You get to dance with abandon in ""Bollywood"" style in the privacy of your home. You work through all the parts of your body and you feel limber and supple after you're done. It gets my day off to a great start!"
2,Terrible teaching,"This video was very disappointing. The instructor is a great dancer, but cannot teach at all. She goes way too fast and the sections change too fast as well. I do NOT advise this for beginners or for anyone who needs a low-mid impact workout. It puts a strain on your shins, knees, ankles, and neck with the moves she does. I believe she was more concerned about looking pretty than making a good workout video. Don't spend money on this one."
4,Worked up a sweat,"Even though I didn't ""feel the burn"" in this workout it did give me a good cardio. I bought it mostly as a fun bonus in the week. After doing Kari Anderson's Dancer's Workout yesterday I think I earned it! My main reason for buying this is to learn some Bollywood dancing techniques. I got to go with a friend to a monthly Bollywood Dance held at the Fez in Portland last month and now want to go every month for the workout. Nothing better than 3 hours of dancing like this to a great beat! I'm not Indian, but that didn't matter. They start the dance with lessons and they the mixes go on! Hemalayaa was kind of silly with the whole sassy thing, but there is that element to Bollywood and I think she was just trying to remind us to keep it light. The directions are not as specific as I'd hoped but next time, I'll slow it down and study the one's that are more complex."
3,I felt like I was in a Spice Girls video.,"I was expecting more traditional oriental dancing, and I guess I should have know better just by seeing the word ""Bollywood"".Pros: Good workout, it can actually make you sweat. Easy to follow. The dance moves aren't precise and this can be good for unexperimented dancers (actually, you don't even need to know how to dance to do this workout).Cons: 1) If you're looking for a belly dancing, do not buy. None of the moves is related to belly dancing. 2) Also, bad, BAD narration (Be sassy! Be sexy! Etc.). Honestly, I would NEVER do this workout with someone next to me. 3) The music is awful. 4) The whole workout looks like a Spice Girls video. 5) Some of the moves can actually be dangerous for your neck/back.So if you're looking for a fun workout that will make you sweat, that's for you. Otherwise, you can find much better dance DVDs somewhere else."
4,Great workout,I am starting from scratch in terms of fitness and found this to be a good way to transition into working out again. I could not finish the video with my first viewing so be prepared for an intense workout if you can make it the 50 minutes. THe first half is a gentle beginning but the last half is extremely vigorous so should be appropriate for low to moderately in shape students. Serious cardio burn for about 35 minutes.
1,Wasted Money,"I purchased this hoping to find a fun, entertaining workout. I was disappointed from the start. Right away I noticed that the instructor, Hemalayaa, isn't in very good shape herself. She has no muscle tone and quite a belly bulge. Additionally, the dance moves are very awkward and do not flow very easily. I mean, even the instructor and her partners to not seem to flow through the moves. As an example, she actually starts off the routine doing facial exercises... give me a break! Do yourself and favor and continue looking for a dance workout CD because this one is nothing more than a dust collector!"
2,There are better workouts available,"I was not impressed. Although this DVD received some high ratings, I tend to agree with those who gave it only a few stars. The video seems thrown together and unorganized. I get the concept but you would be better off putting in your favorite music CD and dancing around. The narration is annoying and the workout is boring because it feels like there's no structure. I would pass on this video. Just my personal recommendation."
5,an exuberant and effective workout.,"yes, at times hemalayaa goes a little fast to follow the first time around, but exact replication isn't the point.this video is tons of fun. the moves are very accurate to modern bollywood films. and the go-at-your-own-pace attitude is refreshing. i just tried this video for the first time right after recovering from strep throat, while still having a cough and i was able to keep up perfectly fine. resting when i need to. and the more you do this video, the more you'll be able to keep up with the festive dance moves."
3,"workout 4, camera 1","I really wanted to enjoy this video, but the camera work just ruined it. Lots of long, lingering close-ups on face and torso, not so much full-body or feet. Even during the 'footwork' portion of the video, hips up angles. How does this help me?Otherwise, the workout was fun, but advanced for this overweight, rhythm-impaired reviewer. I was hoping one of the back-up instructors would do alternate steps for those of us with bad knees during the jumping portions, but no luck.Loved the shoulder/neck warmups.Back to the belly twins for me!"
5,i like it,"I like this workout. It is a lot of fun and different. I like Hemalayaa's positivity and this is definitely a different kind of workout. It is effective too. I saw this originally on Hulu for free and they removed it. I missed this workout, so I purchased it and glad I did."
5,Honestly: The most fun I've ever had with a workout video,"This video is awesome, Hemalayaa makes you feel like a beautiful, sexy woman even if your coordination sucks. It's all about having fun and moving naturally. If you're looking for a great work out video that you'll smile the whole way through and finish feeling invigorated and happy, this is the one for you!"
4,Makes a change,I teach belly dance and just thought it would make a change to add some bollywood moves into my dances. This DVD has helped me with that and also very easy to follow as an excercise DVD
3,"Not what I expected, but OK","I love any type of workout that incorporates dance, so I was excited to get this DVD. I tried it out one Saturday morning and have to say I was not impressed at all. I didn't feel like I was getting a workout at all. I didn't even finish the workout, I was so disappointed. I gave it another shot a week later and did enjoy it somewhat. I still did not feel I got a great workout, but it did help in letting off some steam. This will be something I do on my ""off"" days just to remain active."
2,Music not that great,"I got this because I was hoping for great music and it wasn't worth the money. The dancing is nice, but doesn't help with a workout and the music isn't really that prominent. I only felt like it was good if you want to see how they do the dance moves, but they don't explain how to do it well. I wouldn't purchase this unless you want something to watch, not workout."
3,The Bollywood Dance workout,"The workout was pretty much as described. However, it claims movements are simple. That depends on your age, fitness level. It moved at a very fast pace and had many ""lunge"" type movements which are hard on joints when done quickly and in repetition. Also, some head-whipping type movements seemed kind of dangerous when done in rapid succession also. So, if you are young, and not afraid of fast lunges and head whips, go for it! The music was nice, and the other movements in the dance type exercises were invigorating and looked fun."
3,Not for the knee-impaired,"I bought this workout DVD because it was recommended for beginners and was touted as low-impact on some other sites that carry it. I have recently lost 60 pounds and I can tell you that I wouldn't have made it half-way through this video 60 pounds ago - I would say it was more in the intermediate range. I also had knee surgery a year ago, so I have limitations on how much I can do with the knees.Pros: Lively music, decent instruction, fun.Cons: Has a lot of twisting around, which torques the knees.Has some jumping - sometimes on one leg at a time - which was too much impact on the knees.Lots of knee bending!I think if I did not have knee problems this would be a great video, but I would not recommend it if you are too overweight due to impact and some positions that are NOT achievable with rolls (I still have 30 to lose and that even got in the way)."
4,Fun workout,"I was looking to add some variety to my dance workout collection and I'm glad I decided to try this one. I really like this dance workout - Hemalaya has a very fun and easygoing approach. The reason why I gave this 4 stars, instead of 5 stars, is because the dancing is a little off beat at times - it's not always cued to the music. This bothered me at first, as I was trying to stay with the dancers on screen. But, after a while I just went at my own pace so that I was on beat (even if the dancers were off). The fun and relaxed attitude of Hemalaya made it easier for me to just ""have fun with it"". Also, I like the fact that there's some fun ab work mixed in with the cardio."
4,Get ready to smile,"This may not be the most intense work out you'll ever do, but I can garuntee one thing: you will SMILE A LOT. It's just fun. Let your hair down, and get down with Hemalayaa - this work out with leave you feeling really happy!"
2,Not a great workout and poorly choreographed,"This DVD was just okay for me. I really wanted to like it and like the instructor and it is fun to an extent. Its just that you dont get a great work out and her ""sisters"" were very awkward doing the moves. I can say it is a nice break when you want something different but not exactly what i was hoping for. Some of the commentary was cheesy and sounded really fake. She is trying to sound sexy and excited about the dance steps but its just did not seem genuine. My husband was in the background saying how irritating the commentary was,just not a good job on that. Some of the moves were cute and for the price i paid on Amazon, cant complain."
4,Suprisingly fun,"I don't usually like doing video workouts, but this one really is fun. It is a bit silly and corny, but I do work up a sweat and have a great time doing it."
2,Didn't work for me,"I wanted to like this, since I was looking forward to trying one of her videos. Unfortunately, I didn't like the dancing at all and could not follow along with it. I am beginning to think I just can't do any dance video..."
5,Fun dance workout,"If you want to have a little fun while you are working out, then this is for you. Its a great gift as well."
4,Pretty good workout,"I've only done this work out once. I really enjoyed some parts of it, mainly trying to make my body do some of the unique bollywood moves, like shaking my head around. That felt pretty good. It got boring in a few spots, when you had to repeat a basic dance step for a few minues. Otherwise, it was pretty fun, and a solid moderate workout."
4,Great fun,"This is a great video. It's not about doing the choreography perfectly, but just having fun and dancing around in your living room. It doesn't feel like exercise at all!"
4,Fun and Challenging,I do this workout once or twice a week to keep me motivated. I get tired of regular weighted exercise DVDs or super serious dance workouts. This DVD gives me a chance to workout without feeling as though I am working out. It keeps me motivated.
3,nice cool down,Im in really good shape and I barely even broke a sweat. Its a fun light workout if you are looking for something different that doesnt burn a lot of calories. I do have to say though... it has one of the better cool downs I have done.
3,mediocre,"Can make you dizzy if you dont take a break at the beginning of workout. A little silly. Can be fun, but gets corny after a while. Feels like a waste of time. I would see more improvement on my body on a treadmill. Dances are fun, only if you have time to do them."
2,Hip-Hop meets India,I suppose when i got this i thought there would be more traditional dance mixed in but it is mainly modern street dancing. It reminded me of a music video. I thought i would try different kinds of dance videos to spice up my workout routine. I have an Island girl video and i love it. But this one is not for the faint of heart. If you have knee problems or back or neck problems i would advise you against buying this. She does alot of flayling about that gave me a headache. I felt silly doing most of these moves. Especially the face excersises. She goes to fast and i felt like i was just jumping around most of the time. I also disliked the naration tract over the video. The extra preformance you can watch looks like sleepovers i had when i was a kid and was fooling around with my friends.
1,Wish I hadn't wasted my money..,"I bought this hoping to learn a few bollywood moves and have some fun, but this dvd was disappointing on so many levels. the workout lacked any flow between segments and changed steps without warning. The narration and dancers were often out of synche with each other, which was very frustrating. My other major gripe was that it lacked any of the grace that is found in Indian dancing. I found the instructor very tacky and seemed she was more interested in displaying herself than teaching any moves. At some points it was simply vulgar and that is not what Bollywood is about! I noticed a reivew from a professional Bollywood dancer and she also commented how far-fetched it was."
1,This didn't rock my Casbah,"The main dancer is as cute as a bug, but the moves repeat and repeat ad nauseum -- it feels more like high impact aerobics to me which i HATE. It killed my calve muscles too. Constant jumping and bouncing til my teeth rattle isn't my thing. I didn't feel sexy doing it either which surprised me because I thought I'd be a wildy sensuous indian princess aftewards. Go figure! Nice set but I'm giving my copy to the local library. It just didn't have that sharp, intelligent dance snappiness or, alternately, any down-lo sexy flow -- of which I expect one or the other of in a dance video - especially an Indian one! Big disapointment. Too repetitious in it's movement. Unimaginative. I could have swore I'd love this one..."
3,Fun for a light workout,"This will make you break a sweat but is not a very intense workout. Some of the moves are hard on the knees (the krishna hops and the ""squats"") so if you have bad knees improvise. The biggest problem with this workout is that while it is intented to be somewhat free-flowing and improvisational, the voice cues come after the transitions making it difficult to follow in many parts. Still it was a nice change of pace with pretty scenery and was fun to do."
5,A Good Value Bow,"I'm happy with my Glasser fiberglass bow, it's ligh weight and produces a wonderful toneon my 4X4 student violin. And it allows me to practice longer, being easy to handle witha good structural balance."
1,A Great Big Disappointment,"I am a huge Rod Stewart fan. However, this DVD is an absolute joke. I was hoping it would be a collection of concerts and videos like the KISSOLOGY volumes celebrating the career of the band KISS. Doesn't ROD STEWART deserve such a video anthology? Yes he does (hint, hint). This DVD is not it. It is incredibly over priced. Furthermore, the performaces on the DVD are partial. They are clips of ROD STEWART Live in Melbourne from 1977. I am not exactly sure what the producers of this DVD were even trying to accomplish besides pocketing a few bucks. Trust me, avoid throwing your money away on this. Maybe one day we will receive a great DVD anthology from one of the great rock n roll entertainers of all time."
1,Avoid this one,"This expensive DVD contains a 65-minute concert from late 1976 and features clips from critis throughout the show. The critics really have nothing unique to say, and the show is just so-so. Highly overpriced. Rod fans should stay away."
1,Overpriced,"This book doesn't really have much of interest in it. For just a little bit more money you can buy ""American Mensa Guide to Casino Gambling"" which has a lot of good information."
3,VERY WORTHY EFFORT,SNOOP DID A GOOD JOB ON THIS. A FEW ARE ALRIGHT BUT A FEW ARE PRETTY HOT. VERY INOVATIVE!!(HOW DO U SPELL THAT WORD?) GIVE IT A TRY
3,The idea sounds better than the actual album.,"It's cool to bring West Coast MCs together, but if this is what comes of it, Snoop needs to either re-think these things or reach out to better artists like DJ Quik, WC, Spice 1, B-Real, and MC Ren.As for the album, Kam easliy spits the best rhymes on the song ""Pop Pop Bang!"" Kam is incredible. The only songs I can even get into are the few that feature Kam and Kurupt.Snoop has his mind in the right place by trying to put new/er West Coast artists on the map. But to put them on a disc with Kam, Kurupt, and Eiht....come on Snoop."
3,Are right,This album was alright it had a few tracks that I bummed. I like the Blue Carpet Treatment and his new cut Ego Trippin' a lot more though.
1,another whack one from wannabe gangster,"not one good song here,it's a shame snoop brings eiht and kam down to his level and that is pop.never thought i would see the great mc eiht hangin wit theese busters.stay cmw eiht."
4,Excellent,Good product and a useful device helps bring your GB games to life and make them better and more fun and easier to see and use as well we like it and enjoy it !!!! ;) Helps and makes it fun to play your GB games thru your SNES on your TV ;) !!!!
5,A very useful acessory...,"I have an SNES that I got today! I'm planning on ordering this soon, because you can play the old school way if you plug your console into a VCR, pop a tape in, and you can record your gameplay! Nuff said. Oh! Plus, yopu can select a frame for the outside of the screen."
4,"Super Gameboy. Great, but Not Great","Ok. Well, I've had this cartridge for quite a while, and I admit, I enjoy it.My one and only pet-peve with it, is that it has no Gameboy Color support. I find this very saddening.Also, why is the only Super Gameboy like $300? I bought mine for $10 in mint condition. (I know my levels of conditions)"
4,game boy games on the super nintendo,"as soon as i saw this relic on the net i had to buy it, for those who dont know what this does it plays game boy games on your super Nintendo, so if you for some reason play Pokemon blue for tetris on game boy now finally you can play it on your tv. but i got to say that tis destroys the idea to travel and play your games but its up to you to buy.if your a nerd and likes old skool Nintendo products or want to have a reason to pull out the dusty SNES then its a must buy"
1,the thing was very dirty,"i ordered this and waited for what seemed about a week. when i got home i opened it and it was filled with bugs, so my mom put it in a bag, and the next day, there were like 20 dead bugs in there. i would not reccomend buying this."
4,You still need the chips!,"I loved the book and all the items in the box were great- but no chips! It was nice to have 'cheat sheets', etc, but the book was a better value. Good graphics, too"
3,Not as great as the original,This movie was ok but I didn't like the music they chose.My kids didn't really get into it as they did with the very 1st Little Mermaid.Its not one I would watch very often.
4,Little Mermaid Ariel's Beginning,"this 'used' dvd workedbirthday gift for my grand daughter, so glad it workedshe really liked the dvd very much"
5,Excellent Deal and Great Movie,Enjoyed this dvd. We had the VHS of the Little Mermaid and saw the UTube excerpt of this movie -Ariel's Beginnings - and was happy to find it at Amazon for a low price.
2,Should've Let it Go by Now,"The Little Mermaid and the sequel were made years ago, so why did they just decide to do another one out of the blue? It is just not that great either. It doesn't stick to the first two at all. I think Disney could have given us a great back story on the original characters but blew their chance. This plot was stupid, the music was awful, and I think Disney should have left well enough alone and not made this. If you are a purist and want sequels to stick to the original closely, don't get this."
2,not a typical Disney,"I Love Disney movies. Usually it is because the story is good and so is the music. This story was nice, but I have to say that the music was just AWFUL!It pretty much ruined the movie for me. I mean in one part there was this dreadful piano piece that didn't even fit.Sally Field, as much as I love her, can't sing.Disney could have made this movie so much better. I would suggest they try again with a different soundtrack."
2,Not what I was expecting from Disney,"My daughters kept waiting for the happy ending. They were shocked by Ariel's mother's death. Whereas I know my kids will learn sooner or later about the depressing aspects of real life, I really don't expect Disney movies to help them along on this front. Disney is supposed to be about dreams, wishes come true, and happy endings. This movie falls short of those expectations and just ended up disturbing my kids."
3,Ariel's Beginning Has Ended,"I borrowed this movie from the library because I was nervous about buying it. Sometimes these prequels and sequels can be a bit stretched and cheesy. In the past I have been pleasantly surprised with Cinderella III and Lion King 1 1/2, but here I am afraid I am disappointed. The music was not near the usual Disney quality. The animation was fine. The manitee (though he was cute and my 4-year-old son loved him) seemed a little out of place. Marina (the protagonist) was o.k., but not nearly as ""bad"" as I was expecting the villain to be. The plot was sort-of predictable in a bad way. After we watched the movie last night, my husband said it was stupid. I wouldn't go that far, but it is definitely one we will not be buying."
2,Does very little to answer any questions,"If you wanted to know what happened to Ariel's mother, the first 5min of this movie will tell you. After that, the movie is a complete waste of time with some pretty terrible music.Jodi Benson's voice is great as usual. But they give her horrible material to sing to. Why can't they get decent song writers at Disney anymore?The movie would have been a million times better if it featured Ursula and why she was banished from the kingdom. Instead, we get some new sucky villain who sings sucky songs and has a bizarre relationship with a green monster who looks like it had been playing in nuclear waste.Ariel's mother strangely is an exact replica of Ariel. Which means, while Triton is romantic with her, it looks like he's getting it on with his daughter. Which is pretty creepy.2 stars for some good animation, thankfully. But other than that, it's another sequel/prequel that doesn't come close to living up to the original movie."
1,Too Sad for Little Ones,"My 4yr old daughter loved the scene where Kig Tritan and his wife showed how much they loved each other! But after the mother was KILLED she kept asking what happened to Ariel's mommy??? When she figured out that she died, she got really upset and wouldn't watch anymore. And still won't watch it now! Horrible Storyline!!! Shame on Disney!!!"
2,not really pleased,This movie was rather boring. Both me and my daughter fell asleep watching it. I can see this movie collecting alot of dust in our DVD collection.
3,Great for the kids; will drive adults crazy,"My three and four year old daughters love this movie; I can tolerate it. The first five minutes or so are rough for small kids -- Arial's mother is killed -- but they've seem to have moved past that. The music is not nearly as fun and enjoyable as The Little Mermaid, but the kids enjoy it and I can leave the room for 75 minutes and get other stuff done."
3,"Not Bad, but the orginal Little Mermaid is better","I was a bit let down by this. I expected more in line with the first one, with catchy songs, and great animation. This feels more like a ""made for TV movie"" which was released on DVD."
1,Awful,"The only thing entertaining about this movie is the villain's name, Marina Del Ray. A lot of people do not give children's opinions credit, but my 3 year old daughter even loathed this movie. Coming from a girl who loves cartoons and anything Disney, that speaks volumes. Avoid this movie."
2,Disappointment face,The Little Mermaid is nothing like i remembered as a child. However Ariel's Beginning was good it's a keeper. The Seasons wasn't what I remembered neither :/
3,Ariel's Review,The product would have been a good product had it not been damaged and used when I opened it up and was promised a new product.
1,Nightmares,"Disney should have a warning label. My 3.5 yr old watched this in tears on the way to ""the happiest place on earth"" and after meeting Mickey, Minnie and Goofy, still had nightmares about mommy dying. Who the hell decided this was a good subject for a kids movie?"
1,SO Scratched it isn't playable,"I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, to my surprised it was so scratched up when she opened it and tried to play it, that it wouldn't play. I took it to Hastings so they could buff out the scratch marks, it to was no avail, They couldn't do anything and it still has scratches so deep it wont play. Don't waste your money buying this unusable CD!!!"
4,Good not Great,"Ohkay, now let me start by saying that I love the original Little Mermaid and regard it as a Disney classic, possibly the best; and let me also say that I hated, HATED, Return to the Sea, I thought it was a poor excuse for a movie and was saddened that my Little Mermaid was reduced to that. But I must say that Ariel's Beginning was very well done. The animation was great! You could tell that they actually put some effort into it, and as far as the plot, not exactly original or thought provoking, but I wasn't bored; it was decent. I laughed quite a few times, mostly because of the Yzma-like Villain and her very strange henchman, and a frantic octopus. The songs were not really all that memorable, but I wasn't annoyed by them. Overall the movie was worth watching, and if you are a Disney Movie collector I deem this one worthy, unlike Return to the Sea, to sit on the same shelf as all the rest."
1,"If love old school Disney, avoid this ""movie""","Another direct to DVD sequel/prequel from Disney. Bland color palette and lack luster animation are the foundation of this latest installment to the little mermaid series.The thing that stands out the most is the awful, awful musical score to a series where the original is known for having an amazing variety of songs.Seriously, they have ""Jump in the Line (Shake Shake Senora)"" as one of the songs. Are you freaking kidding me? Not an original Disney creation, one of the crappiest swing songs I have ever heard. I seriously hate the **** out of that song and they play it like 2 or 3 times throughout the movie because it's practically the only song they have.If you had fond memories of the Little Mermaid, you owe it to yourself to NEVER see this movie."
1,Still waiting.........,MAde five requests about returning the item and I am still waiting on the seller to give me return details. So not happy right now.
5,arieldvd,"Excellent DVD and arrived in perfect condition. Packaging was great and the DVD arrived well before the promised date. Played it for our grand daughter the first night it arrived. She has watched it several times since. As stated earlier, it was in great shape and the movie is very good."
4,Pretty good!,"Upon watching this movie, I was actually pretty impressed! Like some others have said, the story is pretty basic, nothing too intricate or complicated about it. I did enjoy the opening where it tells the story of Ariel's mother. I also thought, in general, that this movie had wonderful animation! It's far superior to all of the other straight to DVD Disney sequels/prequels, and dare I say the animation may be better than the ORIGINAL. Although the original is a good, what...20 years old now? I still thought they did an excellent job with the movie overall. My 2 year old loves the Little Mermaid, and I'm glad I got it for her. :)"
5,Perfect,My daughter loves the little mermaid and with it being in the vault this was definitely a life saver for me!! She loved the movie and was exactly as the seller described!!
2,Ariel's mother dies!,"I bought this video for my granddaughter at my daughter's request...it's a cute video, like the original, and we knew in the original Little Mermaid, Ariel only had a father, but neither of us was prepared for Ariel's mother dying in this one! Not a good thing for little ones!"
1,Disgracing and Pointless!,"Oh god, do I hate this movie! The absolute worst Disney direct to video sequel, prequel, midquel, or whatever I have ever known. I have not seen this movie but I have heard plenty enough. It's a disgrace to The Little Mermaid francise, especially the really good television series! The way Ariel and Flounder met in the series when they were cute kids was so good, yet they substitute it in a movie of absolutely nothing. The only thing I can compliment is the animation looking much more modern than the other direct to video films. But that doesn't change the bad choices they made for this story. King Triton is at his worst; he's a total jerk! There's the fact that they've put King Triton and Ariel through another major conflict when they've already had enough in the original movie, there's the fact that bringing music to Atlantica has no point to the original film, it's-I-er-IT'S SO TERRIBLE!!!!"
1,"Violent, scary and just plain stupid","This video is awful. It begins with a depressing story of how ariel's mother died and how this affected her father, ariel, and her sisters - just what you want your young child watching - right?This movie also contains scary scenes and violence."
3,Biggest Little Mermaid Fan you will ever meet!!!!,"OMG. That's all I have to say about this movie. The movie was really excellent. The only reservations I have about it and the why I took away 2 extra stars was because this should have been the 2nd movie and not the third. I won't spoil the movie but I must say that I am disappointed in the evil villain they have in this one and how she ties in to Ursula. Why wasn't this villain Ursula??? It would've made the movie perfect and explained everything. My favorite part was about Ariel's mother. Thanks for not leaving us hanging on her, Disney."
3,"Good movie, not the first one","As far as Disney movies go, this one is good, not great. Anyone purchasing this movie with the intent that it will be as good as the original Little Mermaid movie will be disappointed. It's a cute movie, but it is NOT the first one. Buy it if you want to continue collection and have a child or fan of the Little Mermaid, just don't put too much expectation in it. I have yet to see an animated sequel as good or close to the first one and this is no exception. Despite all that, my daughter enjoyed it and I am glad to have it in our collection."
2,"determinism, anyone?","In ""Culture & Consumption"", McCracken takes the view that we are all beholden to our culture and that it is nearly impossible to break out of it. Unlike the reviewer who gave this volume 5 stars, I feel as though it is overly determinstic in its' approach. There is almost no room for any type of individual behavior, as this does not really exist for McCracken. The book is also heavy on a kind of behavioral pop psych dogma and he does not take any other modern consumption ideas into account. In the end, check this book out from the library if you really want to read it, otherwise you're just throwing your money away on overused dogmatic tripe."
3,Waterproof is cool,"The waterproof capability is very nice. I got some good snorkeling pictures while using this camera. And I had it in the water for 90 minutes at a time. Otherwise, the Pentax is average at best. The camera is so thin that the optics aren't that good. I had this camera and my Canon A610 for out-of-water pictures and it was no contest. The Canon has much better exposure and contrast. The Pentax is very cool in that I can take it anywhere and it is feather light but you'll probably want a second camera for taking very high quality pictures. This is more for snapshots and underwater use."
1,Does not tolerate submersion,"I bought this camera with plans to use on vacation--after a few minutes in the water (1-2 feet max depth) it stopped working. All instructions such a locking battery door were followed. After waiting a few hours to make sure the outside casing was dry--opened battery door and water had gotten inside. It may be a nice camera for splashing around in water but does not tolerate submersing. Buy an underwater case for your camera instead, I wish I did."
4,"Annual ""Waterproofing"".","The W10 (and W20, 7MP) is/are waterproof as indicated by Pentax.What is not indicated is that to retain the waterproofing, you need to return the camera to a Pentax service center every year to have the seals replaced, at a current price of about US$50."
4,Very useful,"I bought this for my wife who travels a lot. She's take it on several trips and has been very happy with it so far.I removed a star because of how difficult the on/off ""key"" is to use. I understand it's that hard on purpose so you don't turn it on by accident but it's just a bit too hard.Also it should come with a warning that the rolling sound is supposed to be that way and your item isn't broken."
5,Great Book For Arch. students ....,"although i am a newly graduated architect i found this book very useful in the field of arch. presentation and drawing as it learns you how to draw plans and section in an effective and easy way , it concentrates on pencil drawing more than colors as it is the baisc drawing machine in addition to some colored examples , Very recommended for new arch. students ...."
4,Excellent Information,"Well written; contains excellent information on the janatorial contracting business. A must buy for somone thinking of investing in this field, or for someone who wants to learn the ropes."
2,It's OK... if you've never played Civilization before.,"Most of the reviews are correct, this version made changes for the worse. Simple things, like creating armies, were taken out of the game. I spent over an hour trying to take over a city and was still unsuccessful. Where as in the previous version it would have taken 5 minutes with an army. The fun left the game. If you don't know what your missing, you may enjoy the game. The graphics are great and the game looks beautiful, but the game play is not there. This ""upgrade"" is equivalent to when Windows Vista came out - I think we are all going to wait for the next version."
3,Game is great. Interface with Mac can be a problem.,I love having a Mac computer. However you better program game to automatically save every 10-20 minutes. I have lost 5 hours of gameplay with this premature mistake. I downloaded bug fixes on a couple websites and this seems to mildly solve the problem. Sometimes you can play the game for like 5 hours problem free. Game is very cool though!
2,"Excellent graphics, but just tooooo complex","Having spent many, many hours playing Civilization 3, I was expecting Civilization 4 to be even better. Well, the graphics are much, much better, but I found the game just too complex. There are too many decisions to make, for my blood. Of course much of it can be put on automatic, but what is the fun of just watching the action? I found the new religion feature to be confusing. I was also disappointed in finding that I could not view as much of the game field as I could on Civilization 3. If I zoomed out far enough to see more of the field, then the field became blurry. I finally gave up and went back to Civilizaton 3."
2,"The game is awesome, the download is a failure","I did this download for my brand-new Macbook Pro running OSX. The game loads fine, but the map pane in the lower right-hand corner doesn't work. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I even redownloaded the file. Nada. Just buy the DVD and wait for it to arrive, you're better off.That said, I've played the game for years on my PC, it's a really fun, addictive game. I highly recommend it."
1,weird screen flickering,"the game looks like it would be great but the top half of the screen flickers with these stripes. you can't really see whats going on and I feel like I'll slip into an epileptic seizure at any second. I tried deleting and then re-downloading the game, but still got the same problem. I am using the macbook pro md102. If you are using the same DO NOT GET THIS GAME."
1,Complete waste of money,"Civilization is awesome but this was a complete waste of money, download doesn't even work. Just go to the App Store and find the versions of Civ4 and Civ5 that do work for the same price."
5,Fun game,"I bought this for my son and he's really enjoying it. There are many different options, so I think it will keep him busy for a long time."
2,"Fun, but broken on powerpc (G4, G5)","This *is* the best civilization game to date, Fraxis did a good job in making it both more realistic and playable. It's a great deal of fun!However, Aspyr did a very *poor* port of the game. While the windows version runs on machines 2+ years old, the mac version only runs on the *latest* hardware. Performance is slow and painful on an iMac G5 and worse on G4 machines. Aspyr needs to release a patch soon to fix this game.Updated 7/21/06Seems that there has been an update to version beta 1.61 Rev A. This does fix a lot of the speed issues on powerpc. Could be faster, but still appreciated since now the game is playable. However, there still are quite a few bugs in this release, and seeing that this is a beta release, Aspyr still has a way to go."
4,A very good and powerful Mac is needed to play.,"Fun game, but I recommend a fairly expensive G5 or better Mac PC."
1,Poor Download,"While I like the game, the download did not work correctly. I have interference lines running across the top half of the screen which makes the game very difficult to play with its full flavor. I would love to download again to receive the game properly, but I do not want to pay a second time."
3,Civilization 4 (Mac),"I run the game on a 20"" 2GHz Intel iMac with 1GB RAM with all of the settings set to MAX and have no problems with the graphics side of things. Audio is a different matter however. Sound effects are often cut short or absent all together and music only plays when you're zoomed right into the screen. As I prefer to play a little further out so I can actually see more than one city at a time I'm usually left playing in silence. A minor problem but frustrating none-the-less.If anyone knows of a way to rectify this or if there's going to be a patch released to fix it could they please let me know by emailing me at neilfraser121@gmail.comThanks a lot"
4,One great game.,Enough different than Civ 3 that you're not playing the same game. Enough of it is still similar that you don't have to reinvent the wheel to figure it out.
1,BUGS! Dell laptop users Watch out!,Great Civ game but a bug rendered it unplayable past a certain point. I've been playing on a new-ish(newer than the game) Dell Inspiron notebook with an ATI Radeon x1400 thingie and plenty of memory and I'm still waiting for the next patch (last one is 1.61). I've tried the most reasonable of the fixes on all the various boards to no avail. I'm not alone.
1,Please do not make the same mistake I made,I have Civ 5 on a windows machine. I thought Civ IV (on the Mac) would be similar and I thought $15 would be worth it. It is not! The game looks primitive in comparison! I wish I had not wasted my money by buying this outdated game.
3,"Really Really fun, really really slow","I like others here, love the civilization franchise. However, I feel that although the game is amazing, aspyr really messed this one up. I am on an insane mac supercomputer and it still lags, haven't had any crash's yet. It lagged mostly when I played with 18 players though on a huge map. I have only played multi play so far as well so I will soon find out if single player plays any smoother.Lots of bugs, LOTS of bugs. Need a patch soon. Love the game though."
2,Poor software that kills the fun,"Despite all the advances in computer technology, this game runs very, very slow an even the latest G5 Macs loaded with memory and a super fast video card. Don't be sucked in by the false promises of superior graphics; performance is way to poor to run the game on the higher graphics settings. At the usable graphic settings the game looks about as good as the 2D Civilization III. All of the 3D graphics are really just a big waste.Based on the poor performance, I cannot recommend this game. There are plenty of other games that are just as fun but run well and give a total sense of satisfaction. This game might be a nice bargain in the clearance bin after you buy a next generation computer sometime next year."
4,Civ IV for iMac -- It Rocks!,"I had Civ IV for PC but when I made the leap and bought an iMac, I had to get a Mac-compatible version of the game. I had thought the game, with its graphics, diplomacy and warfare options, was pretty cool then. The Mac version blows the PC version away! Definitely more intense graphics, great sound, and all the action I remembered. Worth the price to have this for the Mac."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I was pretty disappointed with the new CIV 4. I was really hoping for more of an advance in gaming. Certainly, the graphics are great. However, it really seems more like a throw back to earlier versions of Caesar or Age of Mythology than an advance on Civ. 3. I really like the world views of Civ 3 better, you can see more of the world and the graphics are not as clunky. Civ 4 takes up so much more space and computing power and what you get are really, really big graphics that look more like a children's game. I guess, I'll wait for Civ 5 now. After playing Civ 4 a couple of times, I've put it back on the shelf and I'm back to 3!"
4,Lose track of time,I am reallt enjoying this game. It is the first game I have sat down and played for hours and not realized just how fast time flys. If you enjoy sims this a definately a game for you.
4,Same addictive Civ action!,"I'm not exactly on the cutting edge of computer games, so last week when I decided it was time to splurge on a new game, I decided to go for an old standby. I'm glad I did. My most recent experience with the Civilization franchise was with Civ 3 many years ago, so I have been pleasantly surprised by the updates in Civ 4. The graphics are obviously much improved, the interface is slicker and a bit easier to use, and there is a bit more depth in the game play. The changes are minor, however. Anyone familiar with the previous versions of the game will be able to jump right in with only a few visits to the Civilopedia to look up new aspects of game play or units.I have an old (2007) 2.4GHZ Core Duo Macbook with 4MB RAM and one of the GMA X3100 graphics cards, and the game runs great. The graphics look nice and I haven't had any freezes or hiccups.Anyway, a great version of an old friend. Happy conquering!"
5,obsessive game,"I have stayed up many nights struggling with the wars, economy and exploration of my civilization. In real life practically nothing you do effects the big picture. In this game you are the big picture."
1,Can't get through a game because it Crashes,"Until they release a patch for the Mac OSX - I would strongly recommend NOT buying this game, as the frequent crashes will leave you very frustrated. The game itself is great, but I haven't been able to finish a game because it keeps crashing. Good luck!"
2,Not as fun as the old versions,I used to really like this game about ten years ago when I had a pc. This version is terrible. It seems that Firaxis has focused more on attempting to make the graphics fancy as opposed to continue with the great gameplay this used to have on the pc version. You would do better not buying this and maybe playing anything else.
3,Outrageous system requirements,What else can one say. My PowerBook is barely a year old and this game drags it to a complete halt. Very sad.
2,Very informative but dry reading.,"This book explains in explicit detail the Civil War within Kentucky's borders. It explains Kentucky's importance as a strategic military buffer state for both the North and South. The Civil War in Kentucky explores the underlying political strife that shaped and piloted the Civil War in Kentucky. It touches on the effects this war had on ordinary citizentry. I liked the detailed and little known information included in this book. It gave the background behind many commonly known facts within the state. It was an interesting touch when Dr. Harrison added well selected quotes to backup his facts. However, I thought the book was extremely dry reading. It was difficult to get through the book."
3,Very brief overview,"This is a brief overview of a complex subject. It gives basic information on the political turmoil in Kentucky before, during and after the Civil War and on the few battles which took place in the state, including Morgan's raids. It spends little time discussing Kentuckian Confederate troops outside the state. I found this to be a useful basic introduction but to be very lacking in detail -- I understand the series of which it is part is intentionally made up of overviews. Missing from the book was much discussion of social history and socioeconomic and ethnic divisions within the state."
1,Nothing happened,"First I must say that I live in Seattle and ordered this product in March, when there is rarely sunshine and have weather of 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I received this box in about 5 days, which was unexpected cause they told me they weren't sending it for 2 weeks. However, the box was damaged. Upon reading the directions I discovered it needed a constant temperature of about 75 degrees and a light on 24/7. My house runs on the chilly side, and the only spot for it was my bedroom which made sleep very difficult. After two days of constant light, constant monitoring of temperature, and horrible sleep I was very disappointed to find no triops had hatched. I have more eggs to try again, but not too optimistic about it right now."
3,They are very small,The animals or creatures or whatever are microscopic so you don't really learn much when you can't even see what is happening.
1,Not impressed,"This was a very disappointing gift for my 10 year old and quite frustrating too. We followed ALL instructions, but only 2 out of 100 eggs hatched and they each lived less than 24 hours."
4,Terrific Triops,I bought this product for my son who wants to be a paleontologist. I think that every one of them must have hatched because there has to be at least 50 in this little tank. This is a really great product.
1,"tried 2 times, didn't work","We followed the instructions exactly and no Triops hatched; we tried to keep in going for a few days just in case we ""missed"" some microscopic hatchlings or something. We sent for replacement eggs, and those didn't work either. A waste of money and a disappointment for the kids."
5,"EO - Hand Soap French Lavender, 12 fl oz liquid",Great product but pricey when purchased locally. With free shipping and no tax it is a meaningful discount. Do not over look the 1 gallon size as a refill.
1,Contains Benzyl Alcohol,"Only the Peppermint ""flavor"" lists Benzyl Alcohol, while the Lavender - which I ordered - does not. If you are allergic to Benzyl Alcohol, you will want to avoid this product. I did not discover this until I had the product. Now I have a product I am allergic to."
4,jsight@ibm.net,This book had less cheezy humour than otherDummies books. That is good. It was also a muchbetter book than most other Dummies books that Ihave seen and it was even a little more in-depth.I would recommend it highly to anyone who wishesto learn the art of Warp programming.
3,ABC de la Costura,"Soy principiante en la costura, compr√© este libro con el fin de conocer generalidades sobre el tema. Me pareci√≥ de bastante ayuda. Informaci√≥n general que toda persona interesada en la costura debe saber. Sin embargo, si ud desea alg√∫n proyecto o informaci√≥n detallada sobre un tema, ser√° dif√≠cil que pueda encontrarlo en este libro."
3,Berlitz needs more practice,"After completing Berlitz Italian Think & Talk I certainly feel my several months of work with the CD's and book should have netted better language skills. There is no transcript (in English OR Italian) for the dialogues on the CD's. In the first 6 lessons, the general meaning is stated in English before Italian, but in the last 6 lessons, the Italian speakers chat away, leaving you absolutely no option to learn what is said. There are several points where the book and CD do not appear to match so the exercises are hard to follow. Some of the lessons had useless topics, for example why would anyone want to have a conversation about their ex-wife (lesson 3)? I was especially disappointed that Berliz is running so behind in technology. This is the ONLY Italian language set of the many they sell that is in CD format and I had to purchase the (useless for me) cassettes with the set!! Hope they clean up their act, I have had great luck with some of their other sets."
5,This definitely can't be ignored,"Sure this isn't the Grammophone Bernstein (Overrated? Maybe) or Solti, but this recording definitely can't be ignored!Very fine trumpet solo in the beginning of the piece, very nice (and as Mahler liked, very free) tempi on both slow (the funeral march), and fast (the trumpet - the protagonist - desparately fighting against the storm of collapse and failure). The third movement is a bit slow and heavy compared to most recordings I've heard, but it's still very nice. The soothing fourth movement was excellent, and the remaining two sounded great as well.Like I said before, this recording can't be ignored. Period. Don't hesitante to buy the CD."
3,Too slow and ponderous for my taste,"When it comes to Mahler interpretation, there seems to be two camps. One likes the music played to the hilt and others like it played straight. I belong to the second camp. Mahler 5 timings range anywhere from about 65 minutes to well over 70. This version clocks in about 72 minutes. I find these slow tempos to be quite ponderous. By the end of the second movement, I am worn out. The great scherzo and finale are fine but the other movements just to seem to drag endlessly. My favorite Mahler 5th of all time was a little known recording by the Stockholm Philharmonic conducted by Antal Dorati. I never owned it but I heard it on the radio several times and it was just so perfect. Unfortunately, it never made its way to CD. A real trajedy."
4,"Excellent, almost","A great all-round selection of Traffic's music. All but 3 of the first album tracks are there and a generous selection from other albums. And it's remastered, and as with all ""Gold"" releases, the tracks are in chronological order with info on the particular albums they came from.Greatest Hits albums are really great though when they include rare tracks previously only available as singles - it's a pity the wonderful ""Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush"" wasn't included here. You have to buy the first album remaster to get that, and consequently double up on 8 tracks."
5,Full Gallup ahead,The Horse is really together on this one. It really is in synch with the afterglow of the period from which it came.
5,Taking Liberty,The VHS was very used.The bonus dvd was better to view.This came in timely manner and waspackaged well.I recommend this movie for education.
1,I have not received it yet.,"I take this opportunity to inform you that I still have not received this book.Regards,Angel"
5,A hard-working unknown Roots-Rock band from Austin.,Between the Ditches is an excellent independent release. The Standards explore rockabilly and American roots music to a greater extent than many of their peers. Although this album has a very young feel about it The Standards seem to be very determined and aspiring musicians with excellent song-writing. If you like rockabilly and roots-rock you'll probably be surprised by this effort.
4,4.5 stars,Excelent socks. Feel like a foot massage! Only thing...after two washes there was a small hole by my big toe. I sewed it up and expect it will stay.
3,It's OK,"All of the cartoons are great, except the headliner. ""Superior Duck"" was made about 40 years after the originals, and it really shows. Horrible voices, direction, and story.Otherwise, there's 5 other better cartoons to look forward to! ""The Stupor Salesman,"" ""Stork Naked,"" ""Design for Leaving,"" ""Show Biz Bugs,"" and ""Golden Yeggs.""But, all of these cartoons happen to be on DVD anyway."
5,How to be a sensible investor,"This is, as it goes, a beginner's book. It explains what a share is; what statistics are calculated and used to help to gauge the value of a share, and so on.However, even if you already know such things, you should still read this book. It teaches common-sense investment. I suppose that, maybe, common-sense isn't something that is taught, but it can't hurt to stop and think about why you are (or aren't) buying a particular share (stock).So 5 stars for the book - it will help you to keep your feet on the ground, which is a necessity for any truly good investor."
1,Cuticle drying product.,I bought this in combination with a cuticle pen based on reviews. I am highly disappointed with this product. This makes my cuticles super dry and has a terrible fragrance. Do not try this.
3,doesn't do much for my dry hands in winter,"Disappointed, I usually like OPI productsI have gotten better results from Almond oil or Aveeda productswould not order again"
3,smells too strong,It was not what i was expected. i was looking for more silky feels after i use. but cream it's self is good. it's didn't meet my expectation.
3,Fast delivery,"The nail polishes were not delivered exactly in the same colours as shown on the picture. 3 bottles have different colours, but they still belong to the Blush Collection. I'm a little dissappointed. Luckily, I still like those colours, so I guess it's okay.I received my parcel fast, and that's a big plus!"
2,Does not fit 2nd gen 8G iPod Nano,I have a 8G iPod Nano and the case is made for the 1st gen iPod Nano. The case is a tiny bit too large and is not a snug fit for the 8G iPod. When the case is opend fully the iPod could slide out.
3,too tight,"I bought this case with my iod nano when I got it. Its a great case and protects it from scratches and has a clear screen cover so your screen doesnt get sratched easily. on the box it said it is easy to acsess the hold switch but its realy not. The main reason I gave this 3 stars was because when you have your nano in it and you button it to close it it feels way to tight and you think the screen or buttons might get mashed, but overall its a good case."
4,cute bird for all ages,i love this bird and am buying more for my 5 year old. bird sounds are very realistic. i wish they would provide a way to replace battries.
1,Terrible packing!!!!,"We have purched these items elsewhere in the past and they have been fine. Unfortunately the three just purchased were ""stuffed"" into an unprotected enveloped and sent that way. They were ruffed up and looked horrible!!"
2,NOT rugged cruncher,I thought this toy would last but my dog had the corner chewed up in 10 minutes. Had to throw it away.
4,Timing is EVERYTHING!,"Karen Riggs is in a failing relationship and is struggling to keep her contracting business alive. Melissa Wright is in a superficial relationship with a fashion model. Neither woman truly realizes how unhappy she is until one day Ms. WRIGHT hires Karen to build her new home. Both women struggle with their new attraction while trying to do the right thing.The attraction is immediate and I was expecting the U-haul to appear on every page, but the author keeps pulling in the reins on this fledgling relationship. I find a lot of lesbian fiction to follow the same basic recipe, but this one was a little different. It kept me interested and unsure of what would ultimately happen. This one's a keeper."
1,Spaceballs - the novelization (! ),"If you ever saw the Mel Brooks' movie _Spaceballs_, you MUST remember how Yogur told the good guys what did he do: MERCHANDISING. From that point on, every scene in the movie has an Spaceballs product: the Spaceballs towel, the Spaceballs toilet paper, the Spaceballs lunch box, etcetera.And here we have the Spaceballs novelization. As a novel, it's not noteworthy at all - if you simply watch the movie, you'll enjoy it better and use less time.However, it does work as a joke, by taking the merchandising mania within the movie into real life. Leave it in your library, among your SF books, and wait for someone to ask you of they can have a look at your library..."
1,Complete waste of my money,"I am up to page 190 and am extremely unimpressed with this book. So far it seems to be about 95% padding or waffling, 4% telling you to read the ReadMe's, HowTo's, Tutorials, Manpages, various websites (which any new Linux user has already found, and found wanting, hence buying a book), and maybe 1% useful information.I wanted a book to teach me Fedora - this is not it.I feel I have been duped by the authors and the publishers and would very much like my hard earned money back.( It goes without saying that my opinion of Amazon.com has dropped drastically also ).I live in Africa so I have to go by the reviews I read on line. Maybe those for this book were ramped up.Martin Williams.Port Elizabeth.South Africa."
2,POOR AUTHOR OR PUBLISHER?,"I was just amazed that some of the reviews were from Red Hat 5.2, and the Year 1999.I agree with the author, you do think twice about buying a book with inaccurate reviews?I suggest the author contact his publisher, as in most places it how much you money you have that counts. And I am sure the publisher will know who to phone to get the reviews checked."
4,"Wow, it's been a while and I'm impressed","First off, I haven't listened to Psychopathic music in a good 2 years. I've fallen into the light of bands like White Zombie. With this set aside, I don't listen to rap anymore. But, I've always liked Twiztid's lyrics, performance, history, so I decided to give it a shot. The album is a step back to Mirror/Mirror and Mostastless. Mirror's dark edge and Mostastless' lyrical delivery. They bring so much to the table with content ranging from urban myths to politcal views to religion. So songs are a tad boring but, Jamie and Paulie came through on this. Easliy beats Green Book and Freek Show. If you've never heard Twiztid give them a chance, they are def. worth it. A rap group with a horror/rock edge. I'm looking forward to Mutant more, which is out in late July, because of it's supposed all rock feel. But for now this will do. Worth the money and time."
3,It's ok,"I received this product in the mail and I was disappointed. The case of the CD was cracked and the inside was broken. It was nor broken in the mail because it was wrapped in bubble wrap etc. The CD was shipped to me fast, besides the issue the seller is ok."
5,Best since Mostasteless...,"Before this album was released, I felt that Twiztid would never be able to duplicate the masterpiece that is Mostasteless, but Man's Myth is pretty close. I've never been a big fan of Twiztid trying to do rock music, and this album is almost all wicked rap. Most wicked rappers seem to be getting further and further away from their roots, so this album for me is a breath of fresh air. If you never liked all the guitars that Psychopathic is encorporating in their music,like me, then you will like this CD."
5,WOW!,i was totally amazed by twiztid's new Man's Myth (vol 1) all the tracks are excellent and not to mention the bonus flavor track that is i got five on it remix with the entire hatchet family.
5,the evil two are back,"Its been awhile since we heard from the Evil Two and it was worth the wait. The CD is hot. The only thing I was bummed about was that there was only 13 (1 bonus) songs on the CD. If you minus the intro and the F*&^ U song there are only 12 songs. Now I know there is another album coming out soon but, I was hoping to hear a lot more tracks. Now I'm counting down the day for the MUTANT release. Twiztid is the only group out there that I will take off work so, I can be at the CD store first thing in the morning. Keep doing what your doing... It gets me through the day. Get this CD to you through the day."
2,ehhh,"the music is okay, but what makes this cd suck is the fact that it has a demon george bush in the packet and underneath it it says ""some will make you kill for them"". that p*ssed me off. and then when you listen to the some of the songs its just a big anti bush thing (especially #8 controversy) and that was the icing on the cake. F*ck twiztid if their gonna hate on Bush. So i suggest to stick with the other psycopathic artists like blaze, abk, ICP, esham, and upcoming soopa villains."
3,"Works, but not my favorite","My experience is based on the 0.5 mm model, but here are some general thoughts.Pros: (1) The pencil lead feed ""quicker clicker"" on the side of the pencil is convenient, (2) The clip is sturdy. (3) The eraser is thick and works well.Cons: (1) it feels too thick where the pencil is gripped near the tip, (2) the clear plastic piece around the pencil tip sometimes works its way loose, (3) the small plastic cap covering the eraser is sure to get lost, and (4) the rubber gripping piece is a bit to tacky, and the pencil can be difficult to slide into a suit or shirt pocket."
4,Ribbon Trims book review,"As a new to ribbon embellishments person I found this book very well presented. The coil binding allows the book to lay flat when following instructions. The written descriptions and drawings were clear and easy to follow. I liked the way the author rated each of the trims..easy, intermediate and challenging. She also make some suggestions for how to use each of the trims. The one thing that would have helped me was to have pictures of the applications. I would recommend this book for those interested in ribbonwork and in sewing generally."
4,ribbons and trims,good condition. item as described. great book forlearning to make trims for dresses. good ideas
2,Lacking,"I am getting ready to take off for the Bahamas next month so I decided to take a trip to the ship's store and have a look at the cruising guides. I am heading to the Southern Bahamas so you would think that this guide would be perfect. It is NOT. I took a quick look through the contents and index and discovered he did not cover the Exumas. How could this be? Ah... Mr. Pavlidis wants you to buy YET ANOTHER of his books, one specifically covering the Exumas. Appauling. How can you say you are covering the central and southern Bahamas WITHOUT even one chapter on the Exumas?I think I will stick with my trusty Yachtsman's guide to the Bahamas. It actually covers the Bahamas. It does not leave out A WHOLE ISLAND CHAIN in order to suck up another 30 bucks.The book's name should be The Central and Southern Bahamas Guide EXCLUDING a Great Deal of the Southern and Central Bahamas.Good Grief!"
4,"Best at what they do, which is Space Rock!","Red Giant have been an underground fave of mine since I saw them open for Queens of the Stone Age years ago in Cleveland. Devil Child Blues is a turn to heavier waters than Ultra Magnetic Glowing Sound, and more mature than the even heavier Psychoblaster and the Misuse of Power. If you dig High on Fire, Down, Clutch, or any number of original heavy stoner bands, get used to this one, and you'll definitely have a couple tunes you will not forget!"
5,Great Start,This scope has taught me more about astronomy and astrophotography than I could ever have imagined. This is a great scope to start exploring with. If you want to begin imaging as well this will also teach you the basics of alignment and tracking required for astrophotography. The mount is very sturdy and can handle larger scopes if you decide to upgrade. The wide field of this Newwtonian will provide great views of very faint objects. I truly recommend this scope to start out with!
3,Not quite right,"The book is a facsimile reprint of the third edition. As long as they are doing digital reprints, I wish they could have used a later edition, which included more in it's contents. Otherwise, it was a fine transaction."
3,Shipping method could improve,"DHL shipping method is quite confusing. Apparently, they ship the package to local USPS to do the delivery. In the mean time their tracking page says the package has been delivered, which in the customer's eyes, that means the package should be sitting at their fron door.I called DHL and they would just tell me that the package was already delivered. I then proceded to call Amazon to complain thinking that my package was lost. Of course, the package arrived the next day."
4,Windberg Oil Painting Technique,"Brief overview of Mr. Windberg's technique. Chpt.1 explains surface preparation for stretched canvas as well as Masonite.This covers his ""Tooth Coat"" formula. Chpt. 2 discusses his Windberg Oil Painting Medium & Winberg Slow Drying Medium for his smooth-surface painting technique.Chpt. 3 explains his palette- choice of colors,color mixing and his selection of brushes. It goes on to explain paint application techniques-how he achieves his soft blends. Chapters 4 & 5 demonstrate a still life and a landscape. The final chapter in the 50 page booklet explains Varnishing and its importance to his technique."
5,Chandler on acid,"""City of Glass"", at the very least, will leave you breathless. For most, however, you won't look at reality the same way again. Imagine a Raymond Chandler novel where both the author and the main character are on LSD. In ""City of Glass"", the author IS the detective, and the detective's reality begins to get stranger and stranger.."
5,You are incorrect sir.,"Mesmerizing. Paul Auster throws a tale at me the likes of which I have never seen. This book was given to me by my father, who in turn had been recommended it by a college student studying for his doctorate in english--so basicly it came backed up in force. I had my doubts, especially after glancing over the reviews here---which have since improved a bit--but was astounded upon setting down this book.City of Glass is is for a true literay mind to decipher. If you have at least the slightest interest in either Paradise Lost or Don Quixote this novel is a must. Remember it is a mystery novel, but certainly not the sort I am guessing most are accustomed to=bad reviews. Still I had a blast reading Auster's words, watching him tease me with a few literary techniques I have not ever seen, and doing this in a straight-forward manner. This mystery novel is for the literary sleuth--less the the mystery one. Entertaining."
3,great start; ending fizzles (3 and a half stars),"I was very intrigued through about three fourths of this book. I loved the ideas presented about language and identity. But, towards the end, I found myself a little... well, not bored, exactly... less interested I guess.It's worth reading though; Auster's writing is excellent and his ideas are intelligent and thought provoking. Even though I became a bit disgruntled towards the end, I will go on to read the second volume in the series."
1,What on earth was the point to this inane book?!!,"The only mystery in this book is where the plot jaunted off to. It started off as a mystery, a pretty good one at that, and then all of a sudden it was about a man who had totally lost his grip on reality. Intelligent writer on one page, human with no reason on next. Who in their right mind would train themselves to live like a homeless person for months, disregarding his own responsibilities, and then being surprised to find his life is not as he left it. The first half of the book had nothing to do with the second half of the book. What message was the author trying to convey with the second half of the story? This was the worst book I have read in years."
3,DANIEL QUINN CONNECTION?,"I really liked City of Glass. I actually read it first when I found a copy of the comic book version in the library where I work and read it on a whim. I was in a bookstore the other day and noticed a book called ""The Story of B"" by an author named Daniel Quinn (the name of the ""detective""/mystery writer in City of Glass. From the books jacket, I found out that it has a major character in it (""B""), who believes that the fall of man has something to do with the Tower of Babel and words losing their true meaning, JUST like the character Peter Stillman believes in the book City of Glass. Has anyone read both these books? Was Paul Auster secretly referring to Daniel Quinn, the author in real life, and his book, ""The Story of B""? I think it's pretty interesting, personally. Any ideas or theories, please email me."
2,Fuzzy,"It started really well. Auster seemed to be saying something about identity with his writer character who seemed to have merged into his pen namesake who might have merged into his detective creation and is called to service under the name of Paul Auster.The first 50 or so pages, despite Peter's overlong monologue, show that the writer has talent.The story seems to get lost in a maze of literary/historical allusions and side bars such as the detail on the wanderings of Stillman senior.There are a number of plot weaknesses, such as the detective work starting at Grand Central Station (and not Stillman's releasing institution) and continuing to the likelihood of only one Paul Auster in the NYC phone book and the lack of follow up on Mrs. Stillman's kiss.Perhaps there are answers in volumes 2 and 3 of the trilogy, but there is little here to provoke me to read them."
5,Writes oh so smoothly,"I use this lead primarily in my pentel graph gear drafting pencill which I use for taking notes and dong math. It's perfect, I cannot think of a single flaw. It writes smoothly, it doesn't smudge, it doesn't break, and it erases easily. Is everything I could have ever wanted from pencil lead"
4,Learn About Blindness,"Author Sally Hobart Alexander does remember the color blue because she lost her sight completely at age 26. In this book, she answers 13 questions children have asked her about going blind. Alexander's honesty and wit discussing how she met her husband, ways her two sighted children played tricks on her and how she handles day to day activities, allows the reader to understand how a blind person lives a happy, fulfilling life. A good choice for a 4th or 5th grader. Included in this book is an activity, ""What does it feel like to be blind?"" also a note about blindness, a list of resources and an index. The black and white photographs of Alexander, her family and innovative gadgets are set on black, white or gray backgrounds."
3,"Decent, but preachy","Good book, very well written. My problem with this book is, while the plot and characters are good, the novel itself is a bit preachy and the last half comes off as one great big message about the evils of war and tyranny and blah blah blah blah. A shame too, because the first third of this book had so much promise."
3,Rocky mounts Noose long tray mount,"For the price it works pretty well. Was looking for something that would mount to my existing roof rack with out having to pay $200 bucks. This does the job and I really like the lock.It's quick and easy to mount and secures the bike nicely.The only concern I have is due to the factory roof rack but is worth mentioning. My factory rack has a slight curve to it, so unless i mount it dead center the bike sits at an angle. The angle is not a big deal but it does cause the bike to bounce side to side when turning and going over rough terrain. This is more relevant with my mountain bike which is heavier. I haven't any any problems with it, I just stay mindful to the fact that the factory roof rack will flex.As for the mount itself?? Nice and solid. As long as you don't drive like your playing grand theft auto you'll be find. Defiantly worth the money."
5,history of rock & roll is fantastic!,"The History of Rock & Roll is a wonderful collection to any rock and roll fan. It is a clear concise retrospective diving into the rich history and education of rock and roll. It starts pretty much at the beginning of rocks' roots and takes you on a wonderful journey until present day, leaving very few stones unturned. as much a fan of rock as you may be, guaranteed you will learn new things you never knew. it is a wonderful collection, and i think anyone who is a fan of rock and roll should add this to their library. the price is right too."
5,History of Rock and Roll,It is a great DVD of our stars that made rock and roll today. Seeing this stars sing brings back great memorizes.I recommend this DVD to anyone who likes music.
5,The History of Rock and Roll,A great compendium intertwining music and culture. I use this in the classroom and my students love the anecdotes and the music. My high school students see how their personal music tastes fit into the historical development of the medium they love so much. A wonderful addition to any collection.
3,Too many interrupted performances,I was disappointed to see most performances interrupted by comments from contemporaries of the singer or the singer him(her)self. There was no flow to the performances. Why wasn't the complete performance (song) offered as a DVD extra?Steve Arnold
4,Great document,"Some people say that it is bad, but for me, it's very good, because you can see and learn about rock different things, obviously, this documentary miss a lot of information and discard rock history of many countries, but nothing it's perfect."
4,History of Rock & Roll is a great series,"This review is based on the VHS tapes, but I have been waiting for this release on DVD for a long time! This is an excellent production and well worth owning. If you are a music fan, there will be something in here for you. Insightful and entertaining series I first saw on PBS. 4-stars because I have yet to find any information on any special features for this set (and hope there are some)! Buy it!"
1,very dissappointed,"Was very dissappointed.All the reviews i read about this dvd made it look great.I was ready to watch some live performances of the songs listed, instead it was partial snippits of songs with talking over them.This is a mocumentary of rock & roll history. Don't buy this for the music, you'll be dissappointed."
4,Important Distinguishing Fact,"M. Gilkey, in the 2004 review, made a great observation. There are two PBS rock and roll histories. The initial one, ""Rock and Roll"" was aired circa 1995. I haven't seen ""The History of Rock and Roll"", which is for sale here. ""Rock and Roll"" was amazingly well done. It was more or less an academic documentary, not the ratings-grabber of VH-1 years later. The Experience Project of ""Rock and Roll"" is the way to go. If anyone on here knows how to obtain the original PBS ""Rock and Roll"", please post. You would be doing a great many people an awesome service."
1,Do Not Buy This,I received this as a gift for Christmas this is not the History of Rock. The first band is U2 I like u2 but they did not start rock and then there is NWA (hip hop) and that is not rock and all this was in the first 20 min it has nothing to do with rock & roll it is different peoples thoughts on music and not even the founders of rock thoughts if you buy this and you will be so unhappy with it
3,Has Anyone Had A Problem With The Sound???,"I bought the History Of Rock & Roll and watched it all the way through. The only thing i did not like was on the 2nd DVD there was no sound when the groups were performing. The first one i bought i took back because of this. I thought it was the DVD. Then i started watching it again only to find out that the 2nd DVD in this box set had no sound when the groups were performing. Has anyone else had a problem with this???? I am in Atlanta, Georgia and i don't think that all the box sets could have a bad 2nd DVD. However, it could be possible. If it is a defect on my DVD i would like to know so i can take it back and drive to another state to buy one.Thanks for anyone's help on this.Pat"
3,Where are the Beatles?!,"This might not be very useful as a review, but I was greatly disappointed over the omission of the Beatles' incredible influence on rock music after the 1960s. I understand the lack of footage available, especially at that time, but they were treated as just another rock band among all of the one-hit wonders that dominated the 1960s. They gave more credit to Gerry and the Pacemakers!And do be warned that most of this compilation is simply opinion. You're better off reading a book about this topic than watching the same people talk about their love for different rock and roll bands. This was also done a number of years ago, so the opinions and speculations given are not up to date.Overall, the entire documentary is interesting, but I've seen better. Like a previous reviewer said, you're better off watching intimate documentaries on these bands seperately than watching them all on one compilation."
2,History of Rock & Roll Review,"This is not what I thought it would be, alot of talking and not enough music. They only play small exerpts of songs but never a whole song. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it. I bought it for my husband as a gift, he had seen an advertisement for a product like this on tv and wanted it because it had alot of old footage of rock bands and their music. This has too much talking and interviews."
5,History of rock and roll,This was a great find in the amazon catalog. Amazing music from beginning to end. You will enjoy this enormously.
3,"Hard to find,funny book - ""acceptable"" condition...a bit less than that","My mother and I had come across this book years ago while on vacation; a children's picture book, the pen and ink illustrations and words were clever, causing us both to laugh out loud in the bookstore. At the time, buying seemed frivolous. In the next year or so, we went back to the same store thinking to buy the book, but it was no longer available.When I saw the book on Amazon in ""used - acceptable"" condition for a reasonable price, I ordered it, thinking I could bring my mom a few laughs for mother's day this year. (She lost my dad last fall, and the last several months have been tough.) I was expecting a few condition issues; unfortunately, one of those issues was crayon markings across a few of the pictures.Lesson learned? I guess I need to be more discerning when a used book's condition is anything less than ""good."""
4,Bach,"You must be in the mood for this but the quality of the recording and the artist are outstanding, as was the price! Thank you."
1,Why in the world did this happen?,"The St. Lawrence String Quartet does okaaay overall, but it's a bit of a mystery why they worked with Pratt on this thing when they had a lot more potential than this.Sorry, but the guy just has no clue what he's doing, and obviously hasn't been ""promoted"" based on his professional / musical merit after about a decade of ""trying"".A blunder of a release, and Bach in particular was perhaps the worst thing for these performers to team up on. Hopefully the quartet can get its act together in the future and find worthwhile collaborators.If you *have* to listen to this, find it used. Cheap. Very very cheap. Don't put more into this than the performers did. It's definitely one that listeners are willing to part with without batting an eye."
5,Specific Steps for Parents & Good Q&A for Parents,"I found the book to be very specific with step by step guidelines for parents. I would recommend this book to any parent dealing with ADHD. I would also recommend Mr Buntman's audio tape program that discuss the nutritional supplements that can help children with ADHD.Blaine Oelkers, Director Better Health Institute"
3,Great sandels,"I bought them a half size smaller than what I normally wear which made for a nice secure fit. I haven't worn any other golf shoes since I bought these, they're great."
1,Lousy description,"If you look at the picture and description, you will find no mention of an elastic band right under the adjustable strap. It looks like the entire strap can be open and can adjust it all you want to fit. Could not even put my feet in it. Received credit for the shoe but not the shipment. If they advertise it better, would not have bought it in the first place. Between the shipping cost to me and back it was almost the total of the shoe itself.Then the answer of apology from the seller after I complaint about it with this statement: ""You are not required to reorder anything at all"" You would think that they would want your business and at least refund shipment one way."
2,Okay pencil for the first couple weeks,"Originally I gave this pencil a good review. But I'm here to change that. From a 5 star to a 2. The reason for this is that with all things concidered, really this mechanical pencil is only good for a month, 2 at it's best. It seems like the lead over time lubricates the interior to the point where there is no friction, and instead of the lead being pumped out little by little it just drops out. I did enjoy it for the time that it worked though."
4,shapes AND colours,"A great way to let your child think they are getting TV time while helping with their learning. I use this as a compliment to reading books and one on one learning of her shapes and colours. I am sure there are other similar options out there so I can't say this is the best there is, as I have not experienced the others, but this DVD keeps my nearly two year olds attention by regularly changing pictures, music and presentation throughout the DVD. I also like the fact that it is split into the two separate parts for shapes and colours as she gets her shapes and needs more work on colours, so I can just pick that section from the menu and let her watch it without having to work through all the shapes again - and we all know the attention span of a 23 month old. Good value and a great compliment to learning."
4,In Debt We Trust,"Very enlighteniing on the development of the debt problems we all face especially how we have gotten there with many ideas as to how to decrease our debts and change our purchasing patterns.All families and individuals should view this, an eye opener."
1,Wasting Money,The least informative documentary I have ever seen and I am a career student. This documentary provided no proof for its claims. All of the claims are backed by indivdual opinions with no creditability. Dont waste your money... Email me and I will mail you my copy.
3,"Good, not great, American Rockabilly","This album sounds a lot like a cross between Stray Cats and the Reverend Horton Heat, both very talented and very successful modern Rockabilly. However, although this sounds like a major compliment, the band sounds more like they're taking from those two bands instead of simply being inspired by both bands. I will not say this is a bad album, but I also can not say its all that great either. Its a good album by a good American Rockabilly band. Nothing more, nothing less. Don't expect TOO much and I'm sure you'll be satisfied."
2,History book,"It is a history book about the tire, it has to few about racing and performance tire information, very disappointed"
5,michael schumacher books,"I am a michael schumacher fan since 1991 and i have a large collection of books on or based on him,and this one will join that collection,its the bees knees i am hoping one day to meet michael schumacher and hand over my book i have compiled. but i hope it sells well like all the other ferrari/michael schumacher books and if it does i will be happy as can be, its such a pity that this book you cant buy in england and many other books on michael schumacher one thing is certain in case you cant buy anymore books and audio or cd books are to replace books i will certainly start a collection of them."
4,Gas Turbine Theory,Excellent introductory and overall Gas Turbine text.I recommend it to students and practicing engineers in the field.
3,Returned it,"One of the legs was not secure upon arrival, fell right outof the unit. I didn't have the unit replaced as it didn't glide as nicely as some of the pricey metal ones I have used.It did seem to perform as priced however. If you need one and are on a budget this will suffice, just don't expect the same glide and movement as the expensive models."
4,"Smart, funny documentary about a one-of-a-kind person","Very entertaining, often funny biography of the amazing Melvin VanPeebles, whose life includes writing successful novels in French,directing hit, uncompromised black films at a time when no one elsewas, directing Broadway musicals, and even a turn as a stock trader.A wild, likable, if hard to figure out man, part genius, part showmanand a touch of a con-artist, he seems (at least in this documentary) tohave mellowed over the years.Not quite a great film, it's not in-depth enough, and is too openlyenamored and unquestioning of it's subject, but a fun and historicallyinteresting one. I'll re-visit it."
4,A tad dated but still surprisingly contemporary,"Witty and erotic (without being the least bit graphic) this is a book that both provides a portrait of its times, while still offering insight and commentary into current-day gay like and politics. The more things change, it seems, the more they do indeed stay the same. Recommended for anyone who enjoys colorful characters and keen insights."
4,Alaways Another Mountain,Good book for the hiker or hiking enthusiast. View the great outdoors through the author's eyes and words.Good read.
1,Disappointing read ...,"Having a fascination/obsession with the AT, I have read dozens of accounts of thru-hikes and lived vicariously through their journeys, rarely taking more than two days to devour their stories. This book took me months to read because I was not compelled to read more than an entry or two at a time. Her story could never inspire me to hike the trail. There was no heart to the story, no fondness of the trail I've read from other hikers, no reflective insights to the journey. I finally forced myself to finish reading the book, closed it and said, ""That woman loves berries, but what did the journey do to her spirit."" If you are going to take on hiking the AT, give me something that makes me want to hit the trail."
3,Really small,"My daughter likes it ok, but it is much smaller than I thought. Not their fault though... I didn't read entails closely enough. Quick shipping."
2,tiny!,I guess I didn't realize how small this toy was going to be. Especially for $7 worth of shipping!!! Not worth it!
1,Signal Strength Went from 80% to 20%,I was using cheap generic 2 way splitter and received 80% signal strength according to myChannel Master CM-7000 Digital to Analog TV Converter Box with S-Videoon certain channels and even 100% on others.When i switched to this splitter it went to 20%!!! The channels would fade in and out as a result. So I've switched back to my generic 2 way splitter and still haven't figured out what to do about getting a signal to my 3rd and 4th rooms.
1,Male Connector Broke Off,"The first time I had to remove the cable from the input connector, it broke, rendering the splitter useless. Too bad, it looks nice."
2,If you have common sense you don't need this book,"This slim book is filled with common-sense ideas on how to save money such as cut coupons, buy in bulk, eBay, rummage sales, etc. If you normally live a moderately frugal lifestyle, you won't find any new insights here. In fact, I can add a new one: #66: Don't waste $15.95 on this book."
1,Mine has a problem,"Mine works only after I reset it by pulling the plug and replugging it. My tenant has to come and get me every time she does her wash because the plug is in hard place to reach behind the stacked dryer. The red yellow and green lights do not have a consistent pattern of flashing. It looks like I will have to uninstall it and go back to manual. Technology sucks I'm bummed, maybe they will see this and send me the easy fix and I can change my stars."
4,Very Satisfied!,"I didn't expect this book to look brand new because I got it ""used"" the package took a 2 weeks to get to me and thats why I gave it 4 stars. But overall loved it once I got it."
5,excellent : Ralph Wahlstrom-author of The Tao of Writing,"I ordered this book sight-unseen for a new course I'm offering in the spring. I wasn't disappointed. The writing is varied, often challenging and always compelling. I recommend this to anyone who wonders what creative nonfiction is all about."
2,worked OK until it broke,"It worked fine for a while, but then it just stopped working. I have a home office so it may have received more wear and tear than the average household, but I don't feel that I overworked it."
1,Grimaud doesn't cut it here.,"I have had this CD for many years. Gosh, I tried and tried to like it, but no joy. Then, out of curiosity, I purchased versions of both works performed by Ashkenazy. What an astonishing difference! I realized that Grimaud was probably just too young at the time she recorded this CD because she completely missed the true Russian flavor that was needed to make the pieces work. Now I love both of these pieces (as performed by Ashkenazy) and use Grimaud's CD to play frisbee with my neighbor's dog. Recently, I noticed on YouTube an older, more accomplished, Grimaud as she performed a Rachmaninov piano concerto. Much better, and although I must stick with Ashkenazy on that piece as well, I was pleased that she had truly made it as a serious performer. She is a magnificent pianist now, but not with this piece at that time."
5,Freedom Riders...A must see,"I think everyone would benefit from watching this. I was about 10 years old when this took place. I ""knew"" of it, but after watching Freedom Riders I realized how much I didn't know."
5,Great Documentary,It was a great documentary. I am a high school teacher and I showed it to my high school students. They were very engaged in the movie and they loved to find out the history of the American south.
5,Another winner by Nora Roberts,"What can I say? This book is right up there with Jewels of the Sun, and keeps right in line with her other excellent trilogies. I hated to see the book end!"
4,Slightly Disappointing,"To be honest, this book really didn't live up to my expectations. Something about Shawn and Brenna's relationship didn't sit right with me. They didn't seem to click the way Jude and Aidan did in the first book. This one seemed just to serve as a transition between the first in the series and the last. It was good, but there was something lacking."
5,loved it!,A must read! It was a great way to end the trilogy! loved it! Nora Roberts never fails her readers!!
4,Liked it a little less,"I loved the first in the series and waited anxiously for the second but found myself slightly disappointed. The relationship between Brenna and Shawn sizzles, no question about it, but I was unimpressed by the occasional vulgarity that seems uncharacteristic for Nora Roberts. Still a good read and some very creative intimate moments. Fell in love with Shawn as easily as his brother!"
4,"Capativating, Haunting","Once again Nora Robert's has written another triology making us wish the book would never end.Shawn Gallagher is a dreamer,also a songwriter and works in his Irish pub,and he thinks of Brenna O Toole a his friend and nothing more until Lady Gwen resident ghost of his cottage and her former lover Garrick weave magic folklore and spellbinding dreams to bring the long lost souls to believe in love.I am glad to see Adain and Jude in this novel& can't wait for the 3rd series to see what happens to their sister Darcy. Ardmore is a place I wish was real so that i might go there and visit for I know I would feel at home there with the haunting myths and Irish folklore,too bad it isn't real but I can at least visit it Nora Robert's books where characters are so real you almost feel you can speak and touch them. Once again as with all her books this one is a keeper.If you love Nora Robert's you will love Tears of The Moon."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"The first book in the series was the first Nora Roberts book that I ever read. And how I looked forward to this one. But I came away disappointed. Brenna and Shawn didn't seem to kindle that same fire of love and the situations created that forced them apart, seemed somehow very contrived and unnatural. The descriptions of Ireland and the family life there was wonderful. Even including the legend rings true to the country, but all in all this was not one of my favorites and at times had to work hard to read the book."
5,Another Nora Roberts success!,"Nora Roberts has done it again. With wit and grace she sets forth two amazing characters and sweeps the reader away. I loved this book and read it in one sitting. The beauty and mysticism of the Irish, land and culture, are lovingly portrayed. The people are funny and quirky and very true to life. I am really looking forward to the final book in this trilogy."
3,Slow,"I think the problem Roberts runs into when she does a trilogy, like this one, is that she fails to bring in truly new things in each book. It's kind of like reading the same thing over and over again, just with different character names subbed in. By the time it gets to the end of the second book, I not only don't care about those characters, I feel I can probably write the third one as well."
4,Slow but Charming,"As the second book in the Gallagher series, Roberts puts forth a story that, although a bit slow, is very charming. Brenna and Shawn are both complex characters: Brenna the pixi tomboy and Shawn the sensitive cook. While reading, you can't help but cheer for Brenna because she's the kind of women a lot of us are. Who out there hasn't pined for someone who didn't even notice us. Did you ever imagine what it would be like if they really took a look? This book is so great because Brenna lives that dream for us. Final word: good company expecially on a rainy day."
4,Irish romance,"I am a big fan of Nora Roberts' Irish romances and the second installment of this trilogy, Tears of the Moon, did not disappoint me. Roberts' description of the Irish way of life and the countryside make you want to pack your bags, go walk on the hills, feel the magic of an ancient land. Shawn and Mary Brenna are a delightful example of how opposites attract but what makes them endure - well, you must believe in the Irish and faeries. In the meantime, I will look forward to the final installment of this trilogy."
3,Not her best work,"I have read many of Nora Roberts works and this is not her best. Usually I can't put one of her books down, but this one spent a lot of time on the shelf. In my opinion, this book was rather slow moving and uneventful. I hope that the next in this series is more like the first."
4,Fun sequel,"I was a bit cheesed by the way the romance happened between Aidan and Jude in the first book, but in here, the romance feels more natural, in fact I feel this book is the best of the trilogy. Aidan's brother and Brenna are a lot of fun to read about, especially when they fight. Oh yeah."
2,Boooring!,"This novel really didn't bring anything new to the whole Irish romance legend story. Painfully predictable and very blah... I caught myself rolling my eyes a lot and going - ""oh, come on!"" Sorry, Nora, but you should have stopped at the first one in the series (""Jewels Of The Sun"") which I thought was a true jewel of itself - very cute, romantic, enchanting and a fun read.I suggest getting this one at the library or borrowing from a friend if that ""suits you"" :), but not wasting your money buying it."
5,One of her best...,"Well written,witty, moving. Nora Roberts writing benefits from the more than 10,000 hours she's put into her craft. Highly recommended"
4,Had to finish my trilogy out,"Since my mother liked to randomly raid my bookshelf and trade my Nora Roberts books to a friend at work for some weird thrillers, I ended up missing this book. But since I love the trilogy and had the other two, just had to get it. It's Brenna and Shawn's story, and I like it. Book was in decent condition, and slow to arrive, but overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. I just think they should make half the effort they do when shipping books for Prime that they do for other things(I mean, I ordered a steam mop this past spring and had already mopped my entire apartment 36 hours after I placed the order, it arrived that fast)."
4,Tears of the Moon (Keep the tissue box handy),"Nora Roberts does it again with another triology of brothers. Tears of the Moon shows the drawn line when two friends step over it and become lovers.If you haven't read Rising Tides, I recommend you read after you finish this one. It also is the 2nd in a triology and like this book is about two friends who become lovers."
4,not the best,"Well, ths book was somewhat of a disappointment compared to the first in the series. Although it was an entertaining read, Roberts failed to create characters that lived. From the start of the book to the end, Shawn and Brenna remained as they had begun. The reader didn't feel like she really got insight into their minds. The first book in the series was more romantic and heartwarming. This book seemed flat and canned compared to the first."
3,Tears of the Moon,One of Nora Roberts greatest admirers and found her years ago and follow all her books. Very upset that in this book Nora used the F word. Nora is above 4 letter words in my opinion. Why now ?
3,SOFT AND PREDICTABLE,"Love the author, enjoyed the first book of this series, but thought this one was too predictable."
3,"Good, but not her best!","I waited and waited for this book to come out, I even had to arm restle my cousin for the only one left on the shelf, I lost. Maybe I expected too much, maybe it was too soon, regardless the book did not hold it's own. I understand that you need to repeat things, stories, people etc in a trilogy, but, this was just overkill. It just seemed as though it was a totally different book, not part of an ongoing series. The spunk was gone and I loved Brenna for her previous spunk, where did it go??? I loved her Born in... books and was so happy to have another trilogy, but sadly disappointed in this. I will not arm wrestle for the next, I will wait and borrow it from someone and then decide if it is a re-read or not."
3,Tears of the Moon,"Irish Trilogy - Book 2The second story brings Shawn to find his destiny. After Jude and Aidan marry, he takes up residence in the haunted cottage where continues with his compositions and music. He is perfectly content until fate puts Brenna in his way.Brenna O'Toole has always loved Shawn, but has never done anything about it. When she decides to stop sitting on the sidelines and take control, she pushes Shawn beyond his limit.It takes magic and a ghost to get them to resolve their differences, and love each other."
3,Tuba Care Kit,"This is a very essential kit for older tubas. The brushes are very good and have the proper design to remove the accumulated sludge from playing. It is not a master kit, but is more than adequate for regular maintainence."
2,phone battery,This battery does not hold a charge and shuts my phone down even when the phone shows that the battery still has a charge.
2,CHEAP Plastic....,"Although this phone has so many great details that are mentioned in other reviews, I could not believe the cheapness of the plastic!This phone could have been just a GREAT design and durable as well as I especially like the clock on the cover. Instead, Cingular offers a phone that cost over $300 with all the bells and whistles and terrific technology ....with plastic like a kid's phone. I couldn't believe it and when I mentioned it to the reps on the phone, they stated that all the customers were saying how disappointed they were.I mean, how much more would it have cost Cingular to spend a few bucks for quality materials? If you drop this baby even once, you had better kiss it goodbye..."
2,There are problems,"As soon as I got this phone, people told me my voice was breaking up, sounded like static, noisey, etc. So I took it into a Cingular store they said 'Oh yeah this phone is bad', and exchanged it for another unit. So I am on my 2nd 3125 now. I called a couple people and asked if my voice sounded clear now, and they all said it was still messed up. Now what? The MS ActiveSync is a well known nightmare to get to work. I love the looks of this phone, but frankly I am very unhappy with several aspects. I guess I'll go back to the store again and get a 3rd unit. Maybe one of these will work right."
5,fantastic album,"This album is a killer !And the backing band - the Barnshakers - are fantastic.Check their new album as well. I'm looking forward of the newalbum ""Wise To You"" by Marti Brom"
1,UNSATISFIED!!!,"Lets start off with the picture is VERY VERY VERY msileading. They show atleast 25 feet of gauge 4 power wire with the fuse holder and 1 foot of wire. All you get is gauge 6 wire and the fuse holder and fuse. I should have read the reviews before buying, will not buy from seller again!Second thing the crip on the end that connects to the battery is extremely poor. Whoever this company hired to make the connections should be retrained. Half of the wire had been cut off. Also the crip was such a low quiality that the wires frayed and came out of the connector. I had to cut off part of my 4 gauge power wire that I purchased from a local stereo shop.Third the fuse holder set screws wouldn't tighten on the wires. Both ends were stripped when I recieved this item.I will NEVER purchase anything from this seller again & buyer beware!!! Please read the reviews before purchasing any item that way you will know what you are getting into. I learned a valuable lesson!!!"
1,No Bueno,"I bought this to replace a broken fuse holder and a 5 minute install turned into a 45 minute mess. The terminal was way too small to fit on the battery side-post. I drilled the terminal out to fit the battery post, but the terminal crimp was too close to the hole, so it prevented the threads from catching on the battery. Wound up changing out the wire and terminal for my old one and just kept the fuse holder. Started everything up and no power. Checked power from my amps all the way back to the battery. The fuse was bad from the factory (not blown). I went through all that and still no power. Ugh. Off to the store to buy a fuse..."
1,Product not as described,The product came only as a small piece of wire and a fuse. The description leads one to believe it is the entire cable and fuse.
3,I like the old version without the stupid rubber grip,"I like this model of pencil with the side click and the fact that it holds alot of lead, but I don't like the rubber grip. What ever happened to the old version without the rubber grip? I would give that one 5 stars. I am now wishing that I had bought 10 of them when I had the chance."
3,"Works, but not my favorite","Pros: (1) The pencil lead feed ""quicker clicker"" on the side of the pencil is convenient, (2) The clip is sturdy. (3) The eraser is thick and works well.Cons: (1) it feels too thick where the pencil is gripped near the tip, (2) the clear plastic piece around the pencil tip sometimes works its way loose, (3) the small plastic cap covering the eraser is sure to get lost, and (4) the rubber gripping piece is a bit to tacky, and the pencil can be difficult to slide into a suit or shirt pocket."
5,Simply great!,"This album is the best, all the songs are great I recommended a lot. It is a good work!"
4,"To Dayna, with Love","This is a strong, moving portrayal of a young woman who seems to ""have it all,"" who sits at the doorstep of mega-star rock godess status. Not yet 30, Dayna Clay finds herself haunted by her own mind, driving her to attempt suicide. Her unlikely savior speaks to Clay's basic decency and caring nature. Then she does her best to escape, running away from her life, her friends, her stardom, toward no destination in particular. She meets the Badlands of South Dakaota and there she begins the real journey, one of self-discovery and rebirth.I loved the main character, a strong, independent bisexual woman, whose innate love of life of all kinds finally leads her to seek treatment and learn to once again love herself. McComas' vivid writing and insightful understanding take the reader on a wonderful roller-coaster ride of emotions. This book is a fulfilling read and a real page-turner."
5,Filled with the Holp Spirit,You will never regret for having read it. You can learn much about what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit from A. W. Tozer who had walked with God.
2,Why the Hum and why zero customer service,"I have this plugged into a karaoke DVD player and I get awful buzzing noise out of it whenever someone speaks. It stays completely quiet until someone speaks and then the buzz comes through. I have emailed the seller a week ago but no reply. If someone can tell me how to fix it, I would be ever so grateful. I seem to be the only one who has mentioned this issue so I'm thinking it's something with my connections. But it I can't fix it, I might as well just buy the cheap old $10 corded mics cause this sound is driving me crazy."
3,CLose but no cigar,"Mics and receiver look good and go nicely in my DJ rig. The range is very good. Mics 1-3 sound great but mic #4 has static. I probably won't use #4 very much so it's not a major deal for me. You can't beat 4 long range mics (3 in my case) for what this unit costs. If all 4 mics sounded great, I'd give this unit 5 stars."
4,Nice product for the price. Its missing an RCA out puts to connect to a home stereo.,"Nice product for the price. Its missing an RCA out puts to connect to a home stereo.You will have to use a 1/4"" microphone jack with RCA outs to connect to a home stereo.Otherwise a great product for the price."
2,OK just OK,these mics really require you to hold them very close to your mouth. Great if you are a rock star but not so much for a business setting where the speaker needs to be visible. They work ok overall.
2,Half functional,"I bought this with the understanding that the quality of the sound would not be great, especially because of the low price. I set it all up and did a practice run with the kids at my school for a show we were putting on. The mics started off great, but one stopped working in the middle. I changed the batteries, thinking that the ones that came with the set might have been bad, but it still wouldn't work. Then, when I set up the next day to see if I could figure out what was wrong with the first mic, another one stopped working. I know that I shouldn't expect amazing sound, but no sound out of half of the microphones is just not acceptable. I had to return the set."
5,wireless mics,"Very good product, well worth the money. I would recommend this product to anyone. I do small DJ venues and this is the perfect product for the job. Mics are well built and don't have antenna's and that's one reason I purchased them. Would buy this product again."
3,"Out of sight, out of reception","When I received the product, one antenna was broken, I replaced it with my own- no problemIt is nice for the price. Drawback is that when you have the microphones in front of you with the receiver at your back, it will not pick up the signal and your voice gets lost."
1,stop,It was delivered and it never worked from the start. I try hooking it up to three different systems and all it did was a humming sound. I returned it to amazon and will be refunded.
2,Failed in 5 months,"Purchased this PDWM5000 item from Amazon for a church, worked fine for a while, one mic failed after 4 months, 2 more failed after 5 months of use. Now only one is working. Called Pyle Audio, left msg but no answer, wrote them e-mail no answer."
4,Import rock,I love WIG WAM. These guys look different and that is what got me interested. They rock and they sound great and have cool songs.
4,Brilliant,"With this, the third studio album, we find Color Theory venturing into other musical styles, but without forgetting the originial sound. Brian Hazard (the one sole member of Color Theory) has crafted another brilliant album while retaining the same values he set in his two previous efforts, but he has done this without repeating himself. There are more great synth lines that are reminiscient of early Vince Clarke (i.e. Yazoo). This new album has some of his best drum work yet including some Drum 'n Bass style tracks (watch out Goldie!!). Songs like 'New Years Eve' and 'Now I Know' are reflective, introspective, and full of emotion. While songs like 'April's Bonfire' and 'Faces' keep the dance floor moving. All-in-all, another great effort by Color Theory...Highy recommended."
5,A Melancholy Masterpiece,"To compare Color Theory with any other synthpop band out there would only mislead you. Listen to the clips and you will see what I mean, it is a sound that is familiar yet undescribable. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes electronic music with heart. Standout tracks are New Years Day, April's Bonfire and For Good."
4,Finest Synth,"I'm listening to Synth since I am 15 years old. During that time I recognized that many bands, especially bands from Sweden or Germany tried and still try to copy Depeche Mode in any way. But that is not the way Color Theory (Brian Hazard) makes Synth. Perfect Tears is the best evidence as it includes a wide spectrum of Synth styles. I prefer to listen to the eighties-style songs like April's Bonfire, Guilt Reflected and For Good. In my opinion this songs are highlights at the world-wide Synth-Scene. All songs are made of Synth combined with piano which make the songs smooth and pleasant to listen. But it is not only the music and the piano playing that is great. Brian Hazard also has a fantastic voice and he spent marvelous lyrics to all songs. It is not an album for dancefloor but it is suitable for listening during autumn and winter where things run slower and where it is gloomy outside."
3,Electo-pop music with a twist of classical music,"Being a big color theory fan, I found this album to be a bit of a dissipointment. Don't get me wrong, the songs were written beautifully, the lyrics were insightful, and the vocals are passionate. Yet, the instrumentation made some of the songs too ""cheesy""(lack of a better word). Having melodic, pop structured songs combined with dance beats and electronic textures makes it too playful and at times silly. I would definitely buy a Color theory album that was all acoustic. Hint Hint!!!That would definately show what color theory has to offer."
4,Smooth--Inviting--Mellow,"I must admit that I was not familiar with Incognito or Maysabefore purchasing this CD. I read the description of her music onAmazon.com and listened to a few online samples. Boy am I glad I went ahead and ordered it. Maysa may remind you a bit of Sade however I wouldn't limit her to that quick assessment. Her rendition of ""The Bottle"" is hers alone. I will definitely have to check out her other releases. END"
4,Something for Everyone,"I've been a Maysa fan since the 'Incognito' CD ""Tribes, Vibes & Scribes"", and I must say that ""All My Life"" is one of the most musically diverse works I've ever heard. When I first heard the track ""Got To Be Strong"", I didn't even know it was Maysa. Her style and tone of voice are totally different on this CD than what I'd come to expect of her. The aforementioned track, as well as Mirrors, All My Life and Sunshine are favorites of mine. But the track that stands out most to me is ""Compliments"", which could be described as a combination ""old-school anthem"" and personal invitation from Maysa to put all your cares aside and enjoy the music. The rythm and melody of the song are reminiscent of groups like Change and Chic, and is a very uplifting, feel-good groove. (The bass line grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.) Buying this CD would indeed be a wise investment, and if you get the chance to see Maysa live in concert, don't pass it up. She's amazing!"
5,"Go Diva, Go Diva",The Lady with the voice unlike any. I'm an Incognito head but I love when she does her solo CDs. It's all about her and it's on! DIVA!
4,If You Can't be With the One you Love.....,"I almost drove my car off the road when I heard ""Got to be Strong"" on the radio. Thinking it was possibly from the long awaited Sade follow up (due out shortly), I was turned back onto Maysa instead. Having been a fan of Incognito back in the early ninties, I was familiar with this incredible vocalist and immediately got this CD. The first track is spectacular and that I confused it with a Sade track is a huge compliment. The rest of the CD is a wonderful mix of like tracks and Incognito-ish numbers. Until Lady Sade gets her new CD out, here is one to tie you over."
2,All My Life,"I apologize for this review in advance because I really like Maysa, but I was disappointed with this album. I searched the other reviews to see if anyone felt the same way that I did, but up to this point, I guess I'm the only one.I usually try to listen to tracks before I purchase a cd, but I loved her 1st album and the work she does with Incognito, so I rushed out and purchased it after hearing one of the songs on the radio. That ended up being the ONLY song that I liked. I was SO surprised at this cd.This is more of an r&b type of cd. But she has such a great vocal style when she's varying her range in jazz compositions, that the r&b compositions seemed to suppress her true talent.I'm still a fan of Maysa, but I'm not a fan of this album."
1,"Poor Maysa, wannabe-Sade","I only bought this CD because some misdirected gal was oohing and aahing over it, and then somebody else mentioned that the music sounded like Chic's old stuff - Not! I really wish Amazon.Com had a return policy for used CD's, this would've been on its way back the same day it arrived, now I'm trying to pawn it off on my 50'ish dad, though I doubt he'll take it since he's the one who gave me Sade's latest. Seriously, don't bother, it only makes you painfully homesick for Sade, and the words are just plain stupid. Stick to what you know. There's a reason this chick aint bustin' the charts."
1,I LOVE MAYSA!!![.],"let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks!"
4,"Great songs, great band",The cd was awsome. There are some really good songs on here. The only problem is that it gets old a little faster than other cds. Its a good buy but dont listen to it all the time.
4,Growth And Development...,"Fist off im writing this review for all you cry babys out there that keep trashing on present AFI. Yes we all know older AFI is the best Shut your mouth... Black sails... Art of Drowing...But you need to understand that bands change were not in the 90's anymore. I Love older AFI but i dont want to here the same album remade more then once. The music has to change thats what makes this band so great! Growth and development is what music is all about.Anyways about DECEMBERUNDERGROUND it is a really good well writin album that has a cold feel to it. The guitar riffs and solos are writin better then ever, Daveys vocals have gottin better i just cant see why fans are complaining AFI always changes. I think if your looking to get into AFI start off with Black sails and shut your mouth then go from there...But i do thinkyou should get this Album because AFI is very different from any other band out there and every Album is a different story..."
4,Great Album...shoulda bought the 12'',"This album is great. The sound quality, perfect. The only problem is changing the record every 5 minutes. The bonus song is good and songs like ""Missing Frame"" and ""Prelude 12/21"" sound fantastic."
3,"It's great music, it's just not A.F.I","I like listening to new and fresh music but when I plan on listening to A.F.I i want to hear just that, A.F.I...OK so its been ages since they've sounded like Shut Your Mouth and Open your Eyes and I'm still reminiscing for a sound like that of Black Sails in the Sunset, but this album does nothing for me. It's upbeat, somewhat catchy and experimental but if i wanted that, well I probably would not have bought it. So I'm doing you guys a favor by saying not to buy it, check out the tracks on purevolume (which by the way are the most horrible tracks on the album) but at least it'll be a fair warning. And I agree with someone on here who posted that even Sing the Sorrow was 10,000x better...Kiss and Control kind of sounds like something that would have been on that album.Best so far: The Interview, Affliction,"
1,dont waste your time if you like old afi,"all i can say is this is one terrible cd. Been a fan of afi for many a years now and I bought it when it came out all excited to hear their new music, and it's absolutley awful.sounds like generic pop. it seems like they wanted to please all the little mtv kids by relasing this. bought it a while ago, listened to it once, hated it. thought i'd give it one more shot a while later, and couldnt finish the album. it's collecting dust in my cd rack."
5,A revolution like all great artists,"I'm sure I sound like every other person jumping on the bandwagon after buying ""Sing the Sorrow"", But I remember being 16 listening to ""The Art of Drowning"" thinking, How could this get any better? This album isn't horrible or disappointing like most critics are saying, it is just different. This is what makes a great band great, the ability to expand their sound to different levels and capacities. For a real fan of any band, they can appreciate the fact that they do not want their current work of art to mirror the last. AFI has exposed us all to a different angle of their genius and we should all be thankful for it cause I am pretty sure the reason so many people hate this album is because the're to f**king slow to understand and interpret the deeper meaning of each track. Quit acting like a detective with a fine-tooth comb and just lose yourself in this album."
2,What a disappointment.,"I bought this Cd after hearing ""Miss Murder"" and ""Love Like Winter"". I expected more good songs there. But it turns out these are the only 2 really good songs on the album. There are a couple more songs that are Ok, but overall I don't like this album. All the songs sound the same."
1,Don't Buy this CD,"If you like any other AFI songs/cds that are not ""Miss Murder"", this album is not for you. Lovers of ""Art of Drowning"", ""Black Sails"" and ""All Hallows"" will be extremely dissapointed. AFI has progressed from the dark rock sounds of ""Sing the Sorrow"" to the incredibly cheesy tracks of Decemberunderground. This cd is full of Fall out boy-esque garbage the likes of which Newfound Glory wouldn't even listen to. If you want music with an edge, go buy any All Hallows or Art of Drowning. This cd is rubbish."
2,They Have Gone Down Hill,"They Have Gone Down Hill, Thats It, im not going to explain it, just listen to it. Yes they are good musicians and call play well but The Good old days were Geoff was in the band are long over."
1,"HORRIBLE, just horrible.","First off I'm 18, not a kid by any means. Just don't have an account.OK.. people say that this isn't ""emo""? Listen to the lyrics of any song on the album, AFI is not the same PUNK band we heard pre-Sing the Sorrow, Sing the Sorrow was OK. Nothing great, at all. Thats about as new as you should go for gAyFI. Davey looks/sounds like a girl now, how do all these teenage girls like him?? The only way you'll like this is if your gay or a teenage girl. Leave these guys in the dirt where they belong for putting out such trash after they came out with great albums like Black Sails, and All Hallows. F*** AFI, F*** them up thier stupid a**es."
1,This album sucks,"A friend let me borrow this album because she thought I wasn't giving the new AFI a fair chance. Turned out I was, their music just sucks."
1,afi u suck,"give up, ur not good, nor will u ever. my sister got this cd, i overheard a screamo/post hardcore sound for like 2 seconds and that realized it was this horrible band, if u respect music in any shape or form dont buy this"
2,Just not good songwriting,"I don't care if a band is ""punk"" or whether or not they've become famous. This album is just not good. There is another review on here where the person says you have to listen to the songs at least 3 times because they aren't catchy. I'm sorry, but I thought that was a sign of poor songwriting. No matter what style of music you play, if the song is good it's gonna get stuck in your head. This album doesn't. I've listened to it more than 3 times and I honestly can't hum a single tune from it outside of Miss Murder which is being played everywhere right now. And that song's not very good. It has no structure. It's just a 3 minute length of sound with some Davey Havok screeching. Some of the songs are like a mix between AFI and Depeche Mode. I don't know. I think this band hit it's prime with Sing The Sorrow and can probably look forward to coasting swiftly downhill pretty quickly."
2,"This is crappy pop rock, at its very best.","Not many of the tracks stand out. I guess the intro is decent, and Miss Murder is no longer unlisten-able. Kiss And Control is OK too. But I'm still not impressed. Far from it actually.2 stars for the effort, and hopes that AFI sees better days.Melodic in places, and catchy in others, but it's rather lifeless and dull as a whole."
1,wow,This cd sucks what happened to afi on this one its all mainstream pop and this band has given up on punk and sold out too the emo pop rock on mtv!
2,honest.,"alright here goes. my first AFI purchase was of sing the sorrow, because i had fallen in love with girls not grey. the catchiness of the guitar licks reeled me in. after listeneing to that record non stop for months, i picked up black sails and the art of drowning. i havent really listened to sing the sorrow since.i picked up the newest record today, and even after listening to it three times today, i still am struggling to find that hook that keeps fans drawn in. miss murder is the only catchy song beside the prelude.davey ""uses"" his voice more. but in doing so, throws away his trademark. and on the songs kill caustic and affliction, the band borders every other ""screamo"" band out there. the rest of the cd is soft and nothing special, which severely dissapoints me.it seems like this cd was made if for nothing more, just to make money.the only reason this gets two stars is because miss murder and prelude are great.and today i lost respect for one of my favorite bands."
4,Get one thing straight.,"AFI hasn't changed to appeal to the masses.AFI has changed, and the masses like them better.Grow up, and try listening to the music as it was written, not by how ""unique"" you are by liking a band that not everybody knows about.I'm not even talking about the actual quality of the album. If they've changed, and you don't like it, that's fine. But don't blame it on them being sellouts or going mainstream. Bands change. Get over it. These guys are still the authors of ""Cereal Wars"" and ""I Wanna Get a Mowhawk."" They're still AFI. And this new album is still amazing."
2,"Not for me, but maybe for you.","This album is not the AFI that I've listened to for years. I know that it's just yet another step along the long afi-sound-road, but I think it's a step in the wrong direction. The Killing Lights (track 10) almost made me want to cry. Even Davey's lyrics have lost that delicacy that he touched on so perfectly in The Art of Drowning and Sing the Sorrow.It's killing time again. <-- bad line.Put on your face and let's pretend, <--a little more like Davey..These killing lights won't kill us all again. <--?!That is...not...good.Anyway.Despite everything I've said above this album isn't bad. This is the sort of album that bands produce when they're still trying to get popular before they become awesome. Not something they produce after they have a huge and sickeningly loyal (almost cult-like) fan base. This album shouldn't have taken as long as it did.If you're new to AFI then you'll probably enjoy this cd.Otherwise prepare to be disappointed.."
1,BLam!!,"hmm...this album is by far the worst album ever produced by A.F.I...it was sorely disapointing for me, having really liked ""The art of drowning"" ""Black sails in the sunset"" i even liked sing the sorrow, but turning completely emo? wtf... the only recent song i liked by them wasnt even on the cd ""Rabbits are roadkill on route 37"" and is it just me or does MISS MURDER sound exactly like greendays HOLIDAY? i guess A.F.I was looking only to go mainstream, theys sure as hell did it.."
3,"Not as good as ""Sing the Sorrow"", but what is?","This album is a little different from STS but still has enough of the riffs, vocals, and attitude that it's entertaining. My biggest complaint with December is that it's so short. No hidden track? What's the deal AFI? Seems like it's over about the time I'm really getting into it. There are couple of hard rockers, Kill Caustic for example, but it's a little mellower (is that a word?) than what I would prefer. AFI is still the best band out there, despite what I consider a little bit of a letdown from Sing the Sorrow."
3,dissapointed but it is an ok cd...,"first of all this cd is too slow for my liking, i was expecting it to be harder but it is not. half of the songs seem like ballads, a couple remind me of the killers which is a very bad thing. they have definitely gone in a very poppy/indie kind of way and they have dissapointed me. i will still listen to this cd tho b/c i love afi and will still support them. the screaming i like from davey, it is very full and angry but he only shows it off on 5 songs. i expected afi to come out with something better than this but this is what they gave us and i'll have to deal. it's alright."
5,Some people are senseless...,"AFI has always been a good, powerful band. And whoever said Sing the Sorrow was no good then you are simply not an AFI fan. With the release of their new album, there is, if not anything to complain about! ""Tailor-made for MTV"" I'm sorry but that really is a bunch of senseless misunderstanding. Get real.95% of the tracks on this album are excellent. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone. Yes, maybe they have gone a bit mainstream. But isn't the point of being in a band to make money? I think that is what they're aiming at.""Miss Murder"" is a well-written, listenable, and rather addictive song. Well done AFI.Ignore those bad false and biased reviews. This is an acceptable album and it was well worth the wait."
3,I much prefer the older stuff,"I love AFI, and when I heard Miss Murder on the radio, I went out and bout the CD. I really only liked about 3 or 4 songs though. However, the good ones were VERY good, and I now listen constantly. I still prefer AFI's older music, but I think the band could still put out good CDs for a while."
3,Jeeeezzzzz........,"I am a punk and hardcore music fanatic and have been listening to AFI for close to ten years. With Sing the Sorrow I thought they toned it down a bit, but this pop emo stuff just sucks. Gimme an F'n break. Sorry AFI but you have officially sold out. Your even on MTV countdowns now. Maybe you can start touring with Jessica Simpson or Brittney Spears. The only reason I even gave them three stars is the fact that I still love there old stuff and am hoping they can go back to there roots with the next album. (probably not though)"
3,Ok so this is AFI now...,"I don't know what people are up in arms about...AFI were pose misfits for so long...they paid their punk rock dues! Let them make some money and then we can just forget about them as they peter out.This album...is ok...I mean...honestly sing the sorrow was kind of lame compared to the brilliance of the art of drowning...so this album is no worse (but no better). It's not completely worthless however. If you heard Rabbits are Roadkill on Rt. 47 (for myspace) you'd realize that this PRODUCED record really...seems forced. It has it's moments and AFI has always been a bad ""lacking"" in lyrical greatness...SO...MEH...it's alright."
1,It's not just different -- it's mundane techno-trash.,"I wanted to like this new album, I really did. However, after several sessions on the stereo, it just sounded worse each time. Is AFI trying to play some horrible joke on their fan base? Do they really think this is a good release? This is nothing but silly pop music for the pre-teen MTV set. It's seriously bad stuff, folks. Very painful to see a band like AFI stumble so badly and hit the wall. It's not just different. It's poorly constructed music being performed by a group of soul-less ""pod-people"" (formerly known as AFI)."
2,I'm upset,they used to be our favorite horror-punk band now their allgood charlotte/panic at the disco.sounding like a pop punk bandthis is so far their worst i'm very dissapointed.
2,At least it's better than My Chemical Romance...,"...but it's still a very poor album. AFI are better than most punk-pop bands but ""decemberunderground"" isn't even as good as their older stuff which also isn't very good. The vocalist is annoying and of course the guitars are too simple for my tastes. The bass however is not bad but isn't completely audible either. The single ""Miss Murder"" is average at best with a catchy but also very poppy sounding chorus. Hey, they're better than those fu**ers My Chemical Romance who ripped these guys off completely but nothing good at all. If you want an awesome album released in 2006 buy ""Come Clarity"" by In Flames, ""Rio Grande Blood"" by Ministry, ""10 000 Days"" by Tool, or even ""Stadium Arcadium"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers."
3,Its okay,"I expected more and something a little more original. Sure these guys always wore their influences in bold print on their black t-shirts, but this was a bit much. You can hear a very (VERY) heavy influence of Depeche Mode's Violator and Children of God era of the Swans. Mix that with some catchy Green Day like hooks, and that's the latest AFI album.Don't get me wrong. Its an okay record. Better than something than I could have come up with. I'm curious to hear where they go from here."
5,Loyal AFI Fan!!!,"Decemberunderground is one of the greatest cd's ever!!! I love all of AFI's music and bands do change there style to keep up to date. Davey's style keeps the band going and his voice is great!!! Jade's style with his guitar is his own!! Every song on this CD is excellent and you will never tire of it. Even if you have never heard of AFI, you will love this CD, give it a try!!!"
4,change is not always good but in this case it is!!!,"I really like this album despite what other people say! some might think theve sold out or gone mainstream, but i just think they've maturing and progressed, trying new things with there music, and i think they've done it really well!well done afi!"
5,Great,"I myself loved the new cd. Yes, AFI changed their music drastically. No more did they sound punk, but to me, they sounded a little emo. Not only did their music change, but their appearance changed too. This was not a bad move though. It seems that all bands are leaving their pop-punk backgrounds, to a more emo or goth sound, becuase right now, screamo and emo music is the fad. I have to say that I think Love Like Winter and the Prelude are the best songs on the cd, and Miss Murder would have to be the weakest, even though that too is a great song. I loved the NIN's remix, ""Head Like Hole"" They put a new spin on a already great song. I would recommend this cd to anyone, even if before they were not an AFI fan."
5,another great cd,I have been a fan of AFI for a long time and this album is great! AFI never fails to make great music!!
4,"Four and a half, actually . . .","The thing about this CD is that it, like every album before it, sounds different than every album before it. You can't start listening to it expecting it to sound a certain way, because it won't. You have to listen to it for what it is. In my opinion, it's actually pretty good, and I had very low expectations of it, having loved ""Sing the Sorrow"" and having heard ""Miss Murder"" beforehand. ""Miss Murder"" is, in my opinion, the worst song on the album. It only gets better from there. A couple of songs that stood out to me were ""Kill Caustic"", ""Love Like Winter"", and ""Endlessly, She Said"". It's nothing absolutely groundbreaking, but most people should find this an enjoyable album."
3,Are you people Kidding me......,WTF? thats what I said when I saw most of the reviews from this site. I really liked AFI before Decemberunderground. But sorry this album is horrible. It has no replay value at all. Its a weak and sorry to say POP effort by the band. Their sound isnt what it use to be. I think this album is very boring. I still like AFI but this album was a horrible disapointment. All I can do is wait for the next album to get my AFI fix in.For those that want a honest review my review is the best.
2,bad,"this sucks a lot. really sucks. there are about 3 good songs on it. i don't care about them changing; it's what they've changed into to appeal even more to the masses that is atrocious. i did not buy this album expecting a certain sound or for it to sound like a previous album; i was completely open to anything new and good. too bad, i only found 3/4 songs good. now they sound like a million other punk rock, teenage bands. Believe me, I'd love to say this album was great, but it just wasn't. it's disgusting and watching the band do interviews is also disgusting, because they seem really full of themselves now, especially Davey and Jade - the only ones who talk, anyway, like the other two members are incapable of speech."
1,What happened?!,"Ok, I'll start by saying I'm quite a big fan of AFI. This is their 7th album release. I have all the 6 previous albums. I think the sound they made was quite unique - anthem-type hardcore punk. I respect hardcore punk, not new modern pop-punk like Good Charlotte and Angels and Airwaves for example. AFI's new album though, have dissolved into a branch of modern pop-punk junk. Emo kids will eat this up. With the poppy choruses, and the intelligent lyrics (that was sarcasm), old fans will be disappointed. If you want lyrics like ""DON'T SPEAK MY NAME!"", and 6 choruses of ""Under the summer rain, I burned away"" (in Summer Shudder) look no further. AFI has indeed, burned away.AFI have weakened into a radio friendly band. Banal and predictable. Gone are the anthem days of ""Now The World"", ""Silver and Cold"" and ""Days Of The Phoenix"" to name a few. However, if you're a 13 year old emo kid who appreciates the 'profound' talent of Fall Out Boy then you'll love this generic album."
2,Not their greatest...,"I am usually not one to call a band a sell out, or talk about their glory days before they made it big. But I have to admit AFI's second major label album is another let down. As soon as I heard Miss Murder on my XM Radio I knew the band was going once again for the MTV audience. Then came the ""Fred Durst like"" growl/yell thing Davie did at the end of the song. The rest of the album has its ups and downs but all together if they make a great video it might warrant them a VMA. I just wonder what happened to the AFI from the ""Art of Drowning"" days and before, where their music was straight up power-punk, and truly intoxicating. This stuff is fluff, and yes the MTV crowd will buy it and make them good money. But that's a fickle crowd, I hope they don't let the rest of us forget how good they can be."
4,AFI-all around good musicians,"WARNING: In all, this cd does not sound at all like anything they have ever done. But at the same time it is a killer new album. THe intro to the album is done in same AFI fasion, then Kill Caustic kicks in which is the best song on the cd in my opinion. Then the rest of the tracks just take you further deeper into the oh-so experimental AFI. There are lots of new instrumentations on here which just prove of how just great of musicians these guys are. Davey's voice is beautiful throughout the whole thing. There are weird techno samples that also spice everything up and make it even more weird. New fans of AFI (like the ones that think Sing the Sorrow was the first record) will dig this. Long Term fans (like myself) may dig it depending on how open your mind is."
4,Wow...,"Okay, I don't normally make it a point to buy a lot of rock cds. Check out my other reviews and very few of them are for rock cds. This is because I have different standards for hip hop and R&B cds compared to rock cds. I mean, for me to buy a rock cd, the cd really must have something good to it, and believe me, Decemberunderground has that something good. From the wonderful, tense Prelude 12/21 to the hit single Miss Murder to the final amazing track, Endlessly, She Said, this cd is tense, fun, and beautiful all at the same time. Davey Havoc writes some great lyrics and he sings them awesomely as well. The band does great, as normal, and they make things even better for Davey. This cd is an excellent cd and I have a feeling that I will be listening to it for a long time to come. Be warned, however, that this is lighter than their previous efforts, but still just as good."
3,Okay product..,"The scent is a little off, but it's handy to have in my purse and works for occasional needs when I can't get to my nicer perfumes or carry them that easily."
4,Queen is King,Listening to this cd makes me think of the great days of jazz during the seventies when the songs were great and the musicians played in an exciting way. I like everything about this cd. Alvin Queen plays in a soulful style and is extremely talented. He's easily one of the best drummers around. The band holds together as a group and solos well individually. Pick this one up now. It's good music.
5,The impact of african culture on pop music and dance,I bought this item and would say that it was everything I wished for and more. Educational and entertaining. It really goes deeply into Caribbean culture and demonstrates how music and dance from west africa share much of an almost identical history due to slavery and colonisation. It traces musics and dance directly from Africa to the Caribbean and North America( the Americas). Highly recommended.
2,"Gorgeous ring, stone fell out after a few days","Really loved the ring, but the stone was not secured in place and fell out after a few days. I have still not gotten around to having it repaired. Disappointed because I loved the design, but be warned that your stone may fall out too. I was just lucky to save the stone."
2,Seems like I've read or seen this before,"Heard the taped version of Sandra Brown's latest thriller, HELLO,DARKNESS . . . this one is about the host of a late night radio showwho has a listener who may or may not kill her next.I'm a big fan of Brown's other works, but that said, found this tobe disappointing . . . it was as if I've read this book before (orat least seen movies with a similar theme), and so the plot hadvery little suspense.There were also too many secondary characters to my liking.Lastly, Brown attempted a twist ending, but that too did littlefor me."
3,Same old story,"I love Sandra Brown but I have noticed that sometimes she uses the same template for her mysteries. I'm not going to say exactly what that template is because if I do and you read it it will ruin the book. But if you have read Brown before, know what I am talking about, and get kind of tired of it, you dont really need to buy this book. On the other hand if you are new to Sandra Brown I wouldn't tell you not to read it. You'd probably like it. But still I would probably recommend something else."
4,Stimulating and suspenseful!,"This is the type of novel that I love to read from Sandra Brown. The storyline is excellent, the action is wild and the romance is hot!! Readers are snared from the beginning with a sinister phone call to a radio-talk show host, followed by the kidnapping of the daughter of a prominent citizen. And even though you may think you have everything figured out and know who the psycho is - you don't. Not until the very end. The story takes you behind the scenes of a how a radio show operates, as well as into the teenage underworld of sex, drinking and drugs. Although this is truly a work of fiction, I think its a must-read for parents of teenagers because it stresses the importance of communication and keeping close tabs on these young wannabe adults."
3,Easy on the mind.,"Easy enough to be interested in following the plot as it groups together love interests, past sins and present head games. A good book to keep one interested in ""who done it""."
2,What's between bad and just ok?,"This book. I can't say it was the worst book ever, but I was bored reading it. I could care less about Paris, and if you don't like the main character...I am not the best at figuring out who the killers are, but this one was SO easy, I thought I was wrong. I love that he is a red herring, but still obvious. Was she trying to be coy? I don't like her coy. She needs to stop that."
4,Thank Goodness,"I was shocked at how much I disliked Brown's last book, ""The Crush."" I was afraid she'd lost her edge. With ""Hello, Darkness,"" she was redeemed in my eyes. Is it the best she's ever written? No, but it was classic Sandra Brown. The ending was the best...It bounces you back and forth between suspects like a ping-pong ball until you're not sure WHO did it. I have no problem recommending this one."
2,Bestseller? Not to me.,"The premise wasn't bad, but the writing was. Nothing gelled as it should: The hero/heroine, Dean and Paris, had no chemistry, it was obvious from the first what had happened between them in the past, and the drawn out way it was presented only tortured the reader. And Dean? Too smooth, too even, always ready to do the shrink thing, he had no guilt, and I'm forced to wonder if he had emotion at all. His 'anger' in certain scenes was forced and unbelievable.Not recommended."
2,These stories are pointless... ...,"I was very disappointed with Hello, Darkness. Envy brought Brown to the top of my favourite writer list and Hello, Darkness brought her back down to average. There is nothing but horror in this story. It is another one of those stories where the story makes sense even if the murderer were someone else. These stories do not encourage logical thinking but random guesses and they are indeed pointless."
1,Big disappointment,"A Delilah-like radio program, affluent teenagers with too much time on their hands, parents without a clue, and a dull hero and heroine. That's all that pretty much makes up HELLO, DARKNESS. I usually like the romantic suspense books that Sandra Brown writes, but I found this one to be a big snooze. The characters were either weird or dull as dishwater. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it was excruciatingly boring. Toward the end, I was just skimming to put me out of my misery."
4,Maybe not Brown's best but still worth 4 stars!,I am a huge fan of Sandra Brown and I freely admit that I enjoy all of her books. Hello Darkness is no exception altho not a 5 star story it is most surely worth 4 stars make no mistake about it! Buy it and judge for yourself.
4,Romantic suspense novel,"Paris Gibson is a late-night DJ who works hard to forget her unhappy past. Her fiance was injured in an unfortunate car accident and Paris faithfully visited him in a nursing home until his death. She dispenses friendly advice to her listeners when they call in, but her advice backfires when a girl she talks to decides to break up with her boyfriend. The boyfriend, calling himself Valentino, calls Paris and threatens to kill both the girlfriend and Paris. The police are called in on the case and one of them, Dean Malloy, proves to be a man from Paris's past. Adding to the complications, Dean's rebellious son Gavin has come to live with him and he is soon in trouble with the police. Brown manages to untangle the web she has woven and throws out a lot of red herrings before the eventual murderer is identified. This is not as scarey as some books of this genre, but it's still a pretty good read."
2,"Hello, Darkness","The story was okay, but it was so full of crude words and descriptive sex that I found it hard to believe that a ""lady"" wrote it. I've been a fan of Sandra Brown's for years, but I think I'll drop her from my favorite author list. If you like crude and sexual than the book is for you. If not, there are hundreds of other authors who write excellent books."
3,It wasnt that bad!!!,"If you are looking for 'deep' then this isnt the mystery for you. But it was an amusing poolside book and it had its moments. It certainly wasnt as bad as some of her romance drivel. It kept my interest and the end was a least a good try at being a twist. I notice all the romance mavens are going hard cover now. Have to be careful where you spend your money on these. If you are a died in the wool fan of Sandra's, you will buy it anyway. BTW, her Texas:Sage was most amusing."
2,"Hello, Darkness","I have enjoyed Sandra Brown's writing in the past, but was disappointed in this piece of fiction. To its credit, it did have suspense, and was hard to put down. The insight to the DJ profession was interesting, but it was a stretch that this DJ, Paris Gibson, was involved in (what seemed) all the police investigations and interrogations. Too many potential villains: Lancy Ray Fisher/Marvin Patterson, Gavin Malloy, John Rondeau, Stan Crenshaw, Brad Armstrong, were there more!? If Gavin Malloy told his father 'there is one more thing I need to tell you,' just one more time--it was going to send me over the edge. Too much detail about the Sex Club escapades, and yet the death of the victim was basically 'skipped over.' And did everybody have a crush on Paris Gibson, despite the sunglasses for the sensitive eyes? Sandra Brown can certainly tell a story, and I will probably read another of her books in the future. Hope that I can give it more 'stars' next time."
2,So Disappointed!!,I am an avid reader of Sandra Brown's novels. I've found her latest books to be lacking. This one was the worst. It was too predictable and not exciting enough. I am quite disappointed to say the least.
5,great sandra brown,very good book. typical Sandra Brown...lots of characters and a page turner. gets your attention from page one and gets better as it goes.
3,Not my favorite but not bad,Overall I enjoyed the book but there were to many people that I did not feel connected or tied in enough to the story.I liked Paris and Dean but did not feel the chemistry.Ending was alright but not edge of my seat suspense.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I have dearly loved most of Sandra Brown's books so I couldn't believe it when this one was a clunker. I felt like I was reading a Mary Higgins Clark book because of the way it skipped around to so many different characters. And then it wasn't nearly as good as Mary Higgins Clark's mysteries. I would rather read a book from the viewpoint of one or two people so that I can really get to know them and feel their emotions. The way this was written, I didn't care about any of the characters at all. I just hope her next book is back to her regular standards."
3,"Good, just not great!","I've read several of Sandra Brown's books, like Envy, Mirror Image (my personal favorite) and Best Kept Secrets. I didn't feel that Hello, Darkness was her best effort. I just didn't care that much about the main characters and found it somewhat unbelievable that so many sexually deviant individuals could surround one individual. Kinda creepy!"
2,A 2-star rating is generous.,"I can't even begin to give a description of the story b/c there were too many characters, twists & turns and I'm sure I'd only confuse you if I tried. This book started out strong, but then became ridiculous. Nearly every male character in the novel was a pervert and had some kind of sexual behavior problem. I'm not being sarcastic, it's true.The only compelling part of the story was the romance. The situation seemed realistic and the feelings were genuine. With that said, I still wouldn't recommend this book. Brown's books either completely suck or completely rock. If you're looking for a good suspense by Brown, read WHITE HOT. That book was fantastic."
3,"Could have been great, but fell a little short.","1. What was up with her sensitivity to light? Does a really bad head injury cause this? I really wish they would have gone more into why she always wore the sunglasses.2. There were way too many characters. It got really confusing after a while.3. I really felt the chemistry during the ""memory"" part, but didn't really feel the chemistry between the two main characters in the present day.4. I'm not usually good at this, but I figured out the kiler, the moment they introduced him into the story. It was way too easy!This one is okay if you have a day to kill, but not one of my most recommended."
4,Really 4 1/2 stars,"This book gets 4 1/2 stars from me because I could not put it down. I had to know how it would end. There were so many twists and turns. I liked Dean and his son Gavin and it really delves into how people grow up and how things from their past can and do affect them. The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because I thought the main character Paris could have been made more ""real"" to me. There was so much going on in the book that I think sandra Brown did not spend enough time developing that particular character. Otherwise, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a suspenseful read especially if you have time to do it. This book is not one that you will put down!"
3,"Sandra , l want more romance , please ¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°","This book is not ""Envy"" , but it is not bad .... although it lacks in development of the main characters (Dean and Paris ),and also , I missed something more of romance and passion.Greetings from Spain ¬°¬°¬°¬°"
3,Not Sandra's Best Work,"I had read some of the reviews here on Amazon before I purchased the book and so I wasn't totally surprised when the book did not deliver. I agree that the characters were not fully developed. The story was interesting and there were lots of suspects up into the end, but the end was anti-climatical in my opinion. By the time we got to the killer I'd lost interest. I love Sandra Brown's work and will continue to read her books but this one was just a so-so read."
2,peters out at the end,"This novel was in the same style as many of Sandra Brown's books. It had a lot of the disturbing elements that she uses and which tend to stick in my mind for a long time. I agree with a lot of reviewers that after following the story of the young woman who was abducted, the book really just dismissed that part at the end. I also did not develop any affection for the main character, Paris. I thought she was weak. I would say this book was mediocre at best."
2,When it said good...,"when the condition of the book was described as ""good"" i thought it would mean that the book was actually in good condition. when i received the book i didn't expect to see a ripped back cover, water damage throughout the book, and a worn spine. I would more accurately have described the book as being ""fair"" I'm sort of disappointed with what i received. what really i guess bugs me is that for a little less than 10$ more i could've just gotten a new book, and not had to deal with any of this."
5,My Review,I was happy to see that it was just as described. I could not be happier with the purchase I made.
4,firme jams,this is one of art laboes best compilationscomin from an ol school vato these are the jams
5,Raising Tropicals the Natural Way,"A very good summation of recent information on raising tropical fish. The subtitle, ""Breeding Tropical Fish the Natural Way,"" indicates the author's approach. He stresses the importance of matching water conditions, temperature, lighting, food, etc., to the fish's native enviroment for success in breeding. Very useful are the suggestions as to species that beginning breeders can try with a reasonable chance of success. The pictures are very well done and worth the price of the book alone. Many are full page and all are in color. An effort was made to match the pictures to the text which is not always true in aquarium books.All in all, a very good book for the beginning and intermedicate fish breeder."
5,Excellent classical music,"This is the first ASV Platinum album that I've bought. As a collector of classical music, this album contains the finest classical recordings I've ever heard. All of the instruments are so resonant that it sounds like the musicians are sitting right next to you. This album contains some of Vaughan Williams' finest work, such as The Ascent of the Lark, English Folk Song Suite, and Six Studies in English Folk Song. It also includes several lesser works. This is great study/background music. I've listened to the album over six times since I received it yesterday."
5,For Serious Players Only,"I am a very serious poker player and I play several times a week. I've read most of the poker literature. This book is one of the best. It looks at 77 concepts and analyzes the play of various types of hands based on these concepts. I thought the book was thorough, well written and intellectually challenging. If you play poker this belongs right up there with Sklansky's best work. Renzey obviously knows the various games and he has a marvelous way of teaching his points. But this is not a beginner's book."
5,Great poker book,"Easy to read (unlike many other poker books), full of usefull advice. This book covers Hold'em, 7 card stud, 7 Stud Hi/Lo Split (8 or Better), Omaha Hi/Lo Split(8 or Better). The latter might not be of interest to younger players, but the sections on Hold'em and general poker concepts are worth the price of the book. My only complaint is the binding which fell apart before I had finished reading it."
3,Summer time MP3 Player,"Somma the time it play and doesn't give an error....somma the time I doesn't.When it plays, it's GREAT."
1,Tech Depot an Office Depot comany,Never received the item. They ran out of stock and canceled the order. Never even offered to substitute an item for their failure to deliver as promised. I was very disappointed and I WILL NOT FORGET! I buy a lot of things through Amazon and they should be more careful in choosing thier sellers.
2,Great Player but....,"For some reason, and I don't know why, my Gigabeat resets itself about once a day right in the middle of my using it. I've tried reripping MP3s in case it didn't like the way I had them ripped, I reinstalled everything, I even ran the thing out of juice completely and recharged it and no matter what it still will randomly reset, which is quite frustrating.Other than that, I mirror all of the positive statements that the other reviews have made."
1,Nope,"I bought the 60GB version of this MP3 player multiple years ago. and i never use it. why? the interfacing is ridiculous. you cannot easily make playlists on the fly. it is frustrating to get to the music you want to, and half the time i end up settling for some band in the A's or B's, because getting to the L's or T's is such a pain. Another huge annoyance is that artists names such as ""the Pietasters"" all show up under the T's. I would just turn it into a large equivalent of the Ipod Shuffle (and just have 4 or 5 star songs on it), if getting the Gigabeat to work properly with the computer weren't such a pain.Previous to this MP3 player i had a 40GB Creative that i used obsessively. I miss it terribly."
1,I should have bought an I-Pod and so should you,"I wanted a Toshiba MP 3 player because I sensed more ease of interface with my PC. That piece is true. What I was not expecting however , was that shortly after I started using it , it stopped working. Needless to say this was My XMAS gift to myself. Then I started the oddyssey of trying to get it fixed or replaced!!! I have yet to find a Toshiba cutomer rep who knows what a Gigabeat is. I wound up sending it back to an address I found at a Website. God knows where it is now ... No biggie , time for an IPOD"
4,wonderful features-hard to navigate,"I chose the Toshiba Ggabeat because it could both show pictures and play music. It does a wonderful job of both. I am a little frustrated with how hard it is to navigate, especially from the desktop program. I've had the player for three weeks and still am not sure if I am adding or replacing songs and/or pictures.The battery was supposed to last for up to 20 hours, but I usually get only a little more than half of that. All-in-all I am very pleased with the quality of the output and the large capacity, but I wish it had a more intuitive interface, or at least a better manual or ""help feature""."
3,Impulse purchase--I wish I had bought a Creative mp3 player instead,"Most of the reviews say the Gigabeat is better than the i-pod. I haven't tried the i-pod, but I had a 4 gig Creative Nomad that I just loved. Then I saw the Gigabeat on sale and bought it so I'd have 10 times the space. Big mistake!The player itself is OK, but the software drives me nuts!*It won't load WMA files at all. That's a big drawback, since I have a lot of files that I have to change to MP3.*When you put music on, it copy protects the music so you can't make another copy from the Gigabeat. So it's no good as a backup. You have to have another backup on CDs or whatever.*The menu is very difficult to figure out, and the manual doesn't help.*The installation CD doesn't lead you through the right steps. I had to pull up the manual from the CD and follow the instructions on that.*It doesn't work properly as a hard drive when you attach it using the cradle. My Nomad worked great as a file transfer tool"
2,Some trouble,"For some reason I had a hard time getting the music to download properly onto the player. I have worked with different MP3's, but cant seem to work the kinks out and get the music to actually play on this one. Having said that I cant rate it fairly."
2,Toshiba owner - not happy,"Havent been happy with this item. Difficult menus - when you select to play a song you cant browse the rest of your library without completely exiting and going through each folder again. i have a dell dj, it works great, while I am jamming I can check through the same artist and see other albums. not with toshiba, i have to exit out of all the menus then start from folder one and go through each until i get to the folder i want to browse. Its terrrible. No exit button to get out of some menus, instruction booklet states - ""wait 20 seconds, menu will dissappear."" So you are always stuck. Its good if you have a constant playlist. If you are a track flipper skip it. My gift to you. Dell DJ was good - not pretty , but good - the creative stuff seems to be hot. Skip this one. It was a loser."
4,"""""GREAT""""","I got my mom to get one cuz she wants her music on something portable and easy to carry! Well when it got hear i got it out and put almost all her music on it and that barley filled up a 20th of the hardrive,and that was more then 50 CD's!!!The only complain is that when i tried to use the cradle itdiden't work exept to charge it. But the service from Tosiba was vary GOOD they are sending us a new one without evan haveing the old one back!Well my point is it's great and i like it evan more then Ipods! and i would recomend this to EVERYONE!"
4,Gigabeat F Series - Great But Discontinued,"As pointed out many times this is a great product; however, Toshiba has discontinued this series of Gigabeats. The newer S series are now the standard. The opensource software, Rockbox currently only supports the F series so grab them where you can because there is no date to support the S series."
1,Don't buy a Gigabeat unless you are a PHD level engineer who speaks philapeno,"Tallk about a dud product. This Gigabeat is a flop. Transfering music is an incredible frustration. Contacting toshiba support is an incredible frustration. Using the Toshiba Gigabeat is punishment for a crime you didn't commit. I have a Toshiba computer, it is easy to use. How could Toshiba flub this product so badly. I think they looked at an Ipod, and tried, conceptually, to copy it. What a mistake. The Ipod is made by Apple. The whole Apple company reminds me of Canada. Look at Canadian zip codes, they make sense to someone, but not normal people. If you like the Canadian zip code system, then you will like the Toshiba Gigabeat. I am going to sell my Gigabeat on Ebay."
4,Great player,I purchase my Gigabeat about 3 weeks ago. I have really enjoyed it. I am somewhat frustrated by the soft touch buttons on the front. Some times they are just to sensative. Has geat quality and holds lots of my stuff.
4,Toshiba Gigabeat - 40GB,"Solid MP3 player. Though a bit bulky and heavy, the quality and reliability of the product makes up for it. I'd like to see some additional sorting functions, but the ones available are sufficient for most listeners. Software and docking station are both easy to use and it accepts a variety of different music files. The player is well worth the price and I would recommend it.Pros:- Intuitive menu system- Solid case- Simple to load music files to the playerCons:- Slightly bulky/heavy- Occasional software crashes that result in needing to reset all settings- Difficult to remove files from player"
5,Daughter loves it!,"I bought this for my 30 year old daughter and she loves it. I didn't want to spend twice the money for an I-pod and bought this figuring that if she got some enjoyment out of it, it would be worth the $180 bucks. She loves it so much her mother-in-law is buying one for our 9 year old grandson."
3,Poor operating menu,It lookes good. Metal body is very cool. But the operating menu is not good. You have to wait 60 second to have the main menu turn off. You can't do anything at that time.
1,Confusing!!!,"I was shopping for a cheap MP3 player that could hold my entire music library, and this seemed like a good choice...at the time. But the entire layout of this player seemed spiratic and illogical, it was very hard to find what you wanted. And you can't erase folders once they've been put on. You can erase the files in the folders, but not the folders themselves, so it quickly became cluttered with empty folders, which was inconvienent to search through. And reading the manual (I am one of those manual-as-the-bible type people) was just as confusing as the player itself, simple things could not be found in the manual, and not worth the time to try and find out. After about 2 weeks of being fed up with this, I bought a Philips Go Gear, and have been happy ever since. But this player has made me loose a lot of faith in Toshiba products."
4,Toshiba MP3 player,"Very good mostly, except for the software. It's not very user friendly. I bought the MP3 player mostly to download ebooks from the library, which was very easy, but I can't figure out how to bookmark my place in the book. The user manual only shows how to bookmark the whole book, which starts it from the beginning every time. Very annoying to have to forward to your place, especially with a long book."
3,Short Lived,"I bought this product when it first came out and I had problems with it from the very beginning. The software included does not do a good job with syncing your songs to the player. If you try and load more than one CD at a time it locks up. Plus if you dont format the player through their software the device crashes and you have to go back through setting it up with tech support. Nice big bright screen and audio quality is great, no complaints there maybe later modles are more user friendly."
5,Amazing,"I baught a Gigabeat in the Dec 2005, in the beginig i was not in the favour of the MP3 players as i really didnt liked the quality what i heared previousely, but when i decided to buy a Gigabeat an when it arrived in to my hand i was just amazed with the quality of sound it produce using the Windows Media Player and the SRS technology is it Rocks. I also baught an Ipod 30GB but the compared to the Gigabeat i thaught its a waste of money buying an Ipode so i just resold it and kept the Gigabeat for me."
2,"Good for price, but poor softwear.","I use this player only when I go on vacation because it has such a large hard drive. I can put everyone's music and audios books on it. I keep it in the hotel room and play it with portable speakers. I don't carry it daily because controls are awkward and the software to add files is not user friendly. In addition, the noise of the hard drive leaves me to believe that I should not shake the device without causing harm."
2,Just plain bad,"The program it comes with is terrible, hardly ever works, labels ripped CDs as 'no information', it does not have enough options or features, is hard to navigate, touch thing doesnt light up so its near impossible to work at night.... i could go on... works but is a pain and is just poorly made."
2,WAS good...,"I used to be very pleased with this MP3 player, back when the creators actually cared enough to make updates. It's biggest plus was being cheap and the player itself was easy to use. It's biggest downfall was the software that came with it. I've never been able to run ""Gigabeat Room"" without it crashing while refreshing (otherwise known as deleting) my library. It's saving grace was that you could use windows media player... But only Windows Media Player 10! So if you did the sane thing and went up to 11, the gigabeat now words with absolutely nothing. Now it's an expensive paperweight or external hard drive. If the company still made patches and updates it would be totally worth it, but they've dropped their old product line for the latest and greatest and if you try to contact Toshiba, they'll get you a software update that doesn't do anything to fix the problems above... I do not recommend this at all."
1,The Touch Pad Doesn't Work,"I got this MP3 player as a gift about a year ago. I used it one time and one time only and the touch pad is stuck. When I press the ""up"" portion it goes down and doesn't stop until it gets to the bottom of the screen. When I press ""down"" it goes up. I can't get it to leave the screen where I have to enter the Country I live in let alone play music.A huge disappointment, I have to say. I have tried contacting support but I don't get any response.If anyone has found a solution to this problem, please let me know. It would be greatly appreciated. I am still in the market to find a better product. Until then, I will continue using my ancient but reliable sony CD player for my workouts at the gym."
1,THIS GIG HAS NO BEAT,"UNUSABLE AS TO NAVIGATION, AND UNLOADABLE FROM A COMPUTER.A MONKEY COULD NOT HAVE DONE WORSE."
5,Got mine from Goodwill,"This is my first MP3 player (I've played around with friend's and families before but just to look at their song lists)I found it insanely easy to learn how to use and without a manual caught on quick.The only problem I ran into was it wouldn't sync with my computer. I found off the internet something called RockBox, install it on you computer with your player hooked up and on, install everything then safely unplug your device and turn it off. Turn it back on and you're ready to go. You can drag and drop instead of syncing, it made life so much easier.It's a little bulkier then the newer iPods but still lighter and smaller then my portable CD player.As long as you don't mind it's not the newest thing and bulkier then others (which I don't) I highly recommend you get this product!"
4,Good mp3 player,"I've had this for years now. So long that now I need a new battery and I don't know if I'll get one. I've moved on to USB sticks over time. The only trouble I ever had with was that once in a while it would throw me an error at startup and I'd have to turn the power button off and then back on, and that makes you have to redo all the display options. That, and the files are stuck in there as proprietary file types. But I still love this product- have for years."
4,very good but not perfect.,"I really like this player. You get more space for less price than an ipod. The earphones it comes with, however, do not sound very good and i found them to be very uncomfortable, although I have never liked earbuds of any kind. A good set overall though. I would recommend it to someone looking for an mp3 player."
5,Crazy Durable,"I have dropped this thing so many times and it is still playing. Just the other day it fell off of the top shelf of my locker, which is almost a six foot fall onto hard tile, and it is just fine. Not to mention that i can put more songs on it than i know what to do with, good sound quality, and music transfer is a breeze."
4,Life is good in color.,"I have purchased this gigabeat and it's pretty decent. I didn't like the earphones it was average. The software is mad confusing , You can use windows media player , or giga beat. Sometimes when i select Window's media player 10 from the set up in the mp3 player it uses Gigabeat room. The sound quality is good. You have a lot of equilizer to choose from. You can store pics too and it comes out good. The bright Lcd lite is pretty cool . You can upload picture and set them as your wall paper. Over all this product was ""more bang for the buck"" to me."
3,"OK product, can be improved with Rockbox","Nice hardware, but the Toshiba software is bad. If you're technical, you can easily download and install the free Rockbox software, which turns this into a better machine. At the time of writing, April 2007, this product is/has been phased out. If you can pick one up for around $100 and you install Rockbox then you'll get good bang for your buck."
5,good quality - but table is a little bit to wobbly,....good price...good quality.....the items are packaged very well....easy to assemble.....the only thing I did not like was that the table seemed a little to wobbly so I put a wedge piece in the middle of the table during assembly.....otherwise we are very happy with the set.
3,Not wrought iron but ok,"Don't be fooled, this set is not made from ""wrought"" iron, it is made from steel tube stock.Wrought iron is solid throughout, this is not.I have had the set for about a year now and it is holding up as good as any low end outdoor furniture should be expected to. The paint chips easily and rust usualy starts to form within a day or so if it does.My favorite feature is the springs built into the chair bases. Very comfortable."
3,Very funny film!,"This film won't win an Oscar for best picture; however, very funny movie! The bathroom scene with Rodney Carrington, actor/writer is hilarious!!!Larry[...]"
2,Not a single horse!,"Toby Keith is a great country artist. I have all his records. I would buy all future records from him without checking any reviews instantly. But, Toby Keith is no actor. He has several films that prove this. Beer for my Horses is just one of them. I would not say that the film is bad, just one of those products that you can spend some time with if you have nothing else to do, like watching a good DVD.The Music is of course great and I will buy the soundtrack. Claire Forlani makes the story much more pleasant to live through.I was thinking on giving this DVD three stars just because of the music but sadly Amazon again forgot to inform that there were no subtitles. So, again a lot of the dialogue was lost. It is imperative that this vital information is presented together with the product when you are considering buying it. This DVD had subtitles in Spanish but sadly not in English.BTW: There are no horses in this film...."
3,Beer for my horses,"I tried to locate a copy of this movie last year when in the USA but it was just about to be released, so I missed out. I waited until recently to buy a copy from Amazon.com and therefore had lots of time to build up plenty of hype about Beer for my Horses. Unfortunately the movie did not live up to expectations. There were some funny parts, but the story line was a bit lame. Toby Keith is a great country star, but maybe should choose better material for this movie, showing that he can after his movie Broken Bridges that I would highly recommend.Broken BridgesDarryl WakerleyBrisbane Australia"
3,TOBY'S SECOND MOVIE,"I COULD NOT WAIT TO RECEIVE MY MOVIE. I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, BUT HEY, ITS TOBY, SO ITS STILL GOOD. I THOUGHT THE FIRST MOVIE, BROKEN BRIDGES WAS MUCH BETTER. THIS MOVIE WAS KINDA CORNY, AND ALOT OF SLAP STICK IN IT. IT WAS MORE OF A COMEDY, AND I GUESS I WAS EXPECTING THE MOVIE TO BE MORE LIKE THE VIDEO...AND THINK THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A MUCH BETTER MOVIE. ALL IN ALL, SINCE I AM THE BIGGEST TOBY KEITH FAN, I STILL LOVED IT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS IN IT. ANY TRUE TOBY FAN MUST OWN IT!!!"
5,Toby at his Best,Toby and Rodney are at there best in this movie.i could watch it overand over again.
4,A great show...,"Six wives is a classic album by one of progressive rock's most important keyboard players ever, Rick Wakeman (Yes). It was his first solo effort, with contributions by some of progs greatest at that time. A couple of decades later, he performs the entire album (plus a few extras that are related to the theme) in the one place where he wanted to perform it when he originally wrote and released it.It is a fantastic performance of really amazing songs, aided by the English Rock Ensamble, plus an orchestra and choir, and it is all really impressive. My one complain is that drummer Tony Fernandez (who I admire a lot) uses an electronic drumset with acoustic cymbals. Being great in dynamics, it was a surprise to see him using an electronic set, that takes away from his natural, dynamic type of playing. Other than that, this dvd is great. Buy it!"
5,Great!,Loved Brian Blessed! Next best thing to being there. Sound quality was also great. Thinking about getting Journey to the center of the earth next.
2,Umm......,"I want to be perfectly clear about this I LOVE ALAN MOORE AND HIS SWAMP THING RUN!!!! Now, having said that, this vol is seriously boring and takes a really really really really long time to get where it's going. The first two issues in this volume are really good and I was excited but then it hits a wall and just doesn't go anywhere. One issue I literally skipped because it made absolutely no sense what so ever and I have no clue why it was an entire issue. Also, two of the issues in this book aren't even written by Moore and one of those issues is completely useless and doesn't move the overall story anywhere. That same issue also made no sense to me. It might make sense if I read Swamp Thing before Moore because the writer is the original one but I couldn't understand it. If you need to have this to complete your collection like I do then by all means do so but other then that I will never read this again."
4,"Great book, a bit confusing at beginning if you didn't read DC comics on regular basis.","This is last collection you need to have Alan Moore's Swamp Thing. The story about sentient technological organism is one of best SF stories I have read, but for me, opening story with Adam Strange was too strange :) since I don't know much of DC mainstream, Therefore only four stars."
4,intense and impassioned,"_Dusty Answer_ was Lehmann's first novel, published in 1927 when she was just 26. Sales were slow and not much critical notice was taken of the book until Alfred Noyes gave it a glowing review in the Sunday Times, making _Dusty Answer_ a bestseller almost overnight. Its heroine, Judith Earle, is an intelligent, earnest girl who becomes entangled in the lives of five cousins who have occasionally visited at the house next door to Judith's; Judith played with them as a child, and years later, comes to know them again as she enters adulthood. When they reenter her life, she falls desperately in love with one of them. It often lacks narrative drive (especially in the rather uncertain, diffuse ending), but its intense, often idyllic, and impassioned style is compelling, a foretaste of things to come."
5,The Unicorn,"I was impressed to see the fantastic artwork in this book. it is a wonderful collection, and it is so nice to see a book that includes detailed descriptions of the unicorn, the artwork and mythology around it, not to mention the way the unicorn ""myth"" has evolved over the years. It is well worth the book if you like unicorns, artwork or mythology as it is rich in all of it. The book is great for artists because of the descriptions included, so it allows for personal as well as previous ideas to emerge!"
5,Five Star - One of My Favorites!,I just adored this group during the 80's. Anyone looking to enjoy the sounds of this group will not go wrong with this greatest hits collection.
1,Amoung?,"Why is the word ""Among"" misspelled in the title? How did THAT get by the author and editors?"
2,Not what I thought it was,"You get what you pay for. I bought this thinking it was the ""Blue... da ba dee"" song from Eiffel 65... boy was I wrong. Although, I do admit... they sound good too. The songs are rip-offs of other good artists... mostly NOT good. I guess I should pay more attention when ordering stuff. This CD is in the trash."
4,For those who want to look more deeply into tomography,"This book is an excellent bridge to the more advanced mathematical literature, and a good follow up to Natterer's review of the subject. The contributions of Gelfand and his school to this beautiful subject are deep and wide ranging, and well worth pursuing.Problems with typos in this edition, and skimpy detail on some of the proofs do subtract somewhat from the overall rating, however. I hope the author will produce a second edition."
5,"The old ""Dollar Brand"" stuff!","For those of you grooving to ""Cape Town Fringe"" back in the 70's, this is the first and only time I'm aware of it's cd release, under it's Euro name of ""Mannenberg..."" I had been told by a producer from that label that the masters from the ""Cape Town Fringe"" record were long lost. I can't vouch for the ""original masters"" tag most of us nut jobs like to see, but in listening to this CD and my original vinyl, it's the same, or at least so close that I couldn't isolate any real differences. The other inclusions on the disk are all worth it in their own way, with that unique swing of the early Ibrahim. Worth multiple purchases just in case you get generous and hand one to a friend after a night of sitting back and grooving."
3,Weak taste,"I so wanted to love this tea because it's so good for the planet and people: certified organic and fair trade, made with green energy (it has the symbol on the box), and no staples on the tea bag so I can simply throw the tea bag and all in the compost. That's the reason for the higher rating. But the taste is very weak. I couldn't taste much of the green tea flavor, and never mind the peach flavor. It's similiar to Stop and Shop Nature's Promise brand organic fair trade green tea (which is also very weak). And I did steep it long enough...even too long sometimes because it had the bitter after taste (which occurs after 2-3 minutes in green tea)."
3,Good PLAIN tea,"This is a good, plain tea, but does not have a strong peach flavor. I have not been able to find a good, peach, decaf tea."
2,Icky disapppointment!,"I loved the Mally lipstick and wanted to love this but whoa! It comes out of the tube in too big a glop to begin with. It is rather sticky. It has a cheap teenybopper fruity taste. It--probably because of the fragrance/taste, irritates my lips and leaves them dried-out feeling and irritated the next day.It gets an extra star because it does stay on well for a gloss.Pick the lipstick, one of the sheer shades, not this gloss!"
3,It is ok,"If you have a pinky or very light lips , this is good for you but i have a dark shade lips dont buy it because it dose not have color"
5,A Camp,"A Camp is actually someone very familiar- its Nina Persson from the Cardigans. Her solo album is quite different from the Cardigans' past albums. The first single, I Could Buy You, is simple, melodic, and strangely addictive. This CD is definitly a good buy. Oh- and it has some great artwork too!There are soooo many good songs on the album. My favourites are I Could Buy You, Leftovers, Walking the Cow, Algebra, and Rock and Roll Ghost. Every single song is wonderful! Buy it if you can!"
3,Hits and (mostly) misses,"This appears to be the beginning of Persson's foray into more American country-tinged styles, as well as a chance to see how well she can stand on her own. Persson's lack of vocal prowess has always been compensated for by a certain girlish charm (and not-quite-shedded Swedish accent perhaps) but is that enough to sustain her first real full length record? There are a number of single-worthy efforts (I Can Buy You, Walking The Cow, and the MOR-friendly Bluest Eyes In Texas) but for the most part it all sounds pleasantly listless, like doodling on a lazy afternoon. Past the halfway mark, the album's flow is weakened by the awkward insertion of hard-rocking tunes among laidback ones. A letdown to be sure, but a minor one which shouldn't stop A Camp from being a reasonably interesting compilation of Persson's solo ideas."
5,Nina rocks,"I got this album several years ago once I heard that Nina Persson was going off to do a solo. I think that the Cardigans are one of the most underrated bands ever in the U.S. although I think they do quite well in their native Sweden. Her vocals are more pronounced here, and there is some time you need to get used to her without the sugary 60's pop music background. Once you do, you will realize that the music is just great..."
1,Has both English & Spanish,"You have to know to change this DVD to play in Spanish. This occurs at the beginning of the DVD so you may miss it, like I did, if you are not paying attention."
2,1 Tube only!,"Be sure to read EVERY detail you are only buying 1 tube only! Best to look somewhere else for a cheaper price, Felt ripped off."
5,Great listening for kids and adults,"I like this recording almost as much as my son does, who I bought this for. Erbsen has a voice that grows on you and his blend of instruments works perfectly. This is the second CD of his we've bought and we like the first one as much."
4,Railroad folk music,This is a fun to listen to CD of folk songs about railroading. The recording was very good and well worth the money.
3,Frustrating,"I would love to give this a five star review, but I can't seem to get through the whole DVD before giving up. I wanted more challenging choreography, but I feel like I could try this for the rest of my life and never figure out the steps. I can't work up a sweat because I spend my whole time watching, unable to catch on. I have watched it without doing the moves twice, and twice have tried stopping after each new move to try it over and over with no luck. It looks like it would be fun of I could figure it out! For now, I'll have to do my usual workout in the morning, and, if I have time in the evening, keep trying this little by little."
3,disappointed,"I was looking for a DVD with fun challenging choreography that would make me forget how hard I was working. I was really uninspired by this one. I think mostly because the music was boring and blah, which made the whole DVD boring and blah. The moves were a bit challenging to learn, but overall, it just wasn't FUN. Maybe if it was set to more upbeat music I would have liked it more."
4,"great songs, shameless marketing","I give this collection 4-stars because these really are great songs...many of Rod Stewart's best in my opinion. The problem is that you might be well advised to buy the ""Reason to Believe"" set of 3 CDs (also re-mastered and contains quite a few more songs that I think are worthwhile) instead. I find Rod Stewart's old ""Mercury recordings"" to be my favorites by far, but I agree with the other reviewer's frustration over the question of how many ways can they package this material? I'm glad it's still available, but the bizarre record company marketing strategies make choosing a collection way too complicated."
1,A Wasted Opportunity,"What This Could Have Been: When I saw first saw that Hip-O had anthologized Rod Stewart for their ""Gold"" compilation series, I thought, finally, a two cd set spanning Rod's entire career, maybe including some Faces stuff, plus all the classics like ""Some Guys Have All The Luck"", ""Maggie Mae"" and ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy"".What It Is: As soon as I turned over to look at the track listing, my hopes for a complete anthology were crushed. All this is another cheap way to get Rod's Mercury material. Don't get me wrong, a lot of this stuff is among his best work, but how many repackagings of his years at Mercury need to be released? Isn't the ""Reason To Believe"" boxed set enough? Plus, for every great track on here, there is a ton of filler to augment it.Bottom line: Stick with the ""Storyteller"" boxed set, which includes most of the songs on here plus all his best work up to 1990, and then download all his stuff from ""Vagabond Heart"" onward. This collection is unneccessary."
2,seems to me this has been done before...,"Well, if you don't have Rod's first four albums, or the two-disc _Mercury Anthology_, or Polydor's _Best of_ 1+2, or the _Reason to Belive_ box set... then you probably don't care about this material anyway. The last thing the world needs is another compilation of Rod's Mercury years. Uckh!"
5,The Best Play Food!,"My daughter loves the Haba food. She has this can of stew and loves ""cooking"" with it. Yes, it is small as the measurements on the description indicate, but that is what makes it fun because it fits perfectly in toy bowls and pans. This toy is for older children, not babies. My daughter is almost 6 and she is at the age where she really enjoys pretend cooking. She also enjoys each little tin and always puts the correct items in each one. This stew is perfect for mixing with the other Haba products and I highly recommend it."
3,"Fun, but not enough Esquivel","Too many tunes written by others for me to really enjoy this as an Esquivel experience. I prefer his recordings of his own tunes, of which there are few on this CD."
4,Just the Best CD,"World/Inferno Friendship Society... what can I say except WOW. I love this band. Nothing is better than seeing them live (they really know how to get a crowd going), but this cd was a pleasant surprise. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than ""East coast super sound punk of today."" There are a lot of good dancy tracks like ""Zen and the Art of..."" and ""My ancestral homeland, new jersey,"" but I would have to say my favorite track is ""Friend to the Friendless."" I would reccommend this cd to anyone who loves to dance and have a great time."
1,Disappointed,This seller never responded to any of my concerns. Thanks to Amazon I finally arranged for a refund. I will never deal with this seller again. The product was cheaply made and in my opinion; unsafe for it's intended use. I ended up buying the Little Tikes 8x8 version which was durable and priced the same. Don't waste your time with this one.
2,Not a How-To Guide. Just a set of concise essays,This book is written as a simple introduction which can be best described as set of essays. Here is what I think can improve in this book:1. Real life exporting/importing example and scenarios with actual sample forms.2. More information on importing could be useful (Just one chapter on importing!!)Over all if you hold a management position where you have people doing all paper work for you and you just want a quick overview - it could be a useful book. If you are an entrepreneur looking to do most of the things yourself don't bother buying this book. (Its exactly opposit to what the title of this book says)
1,Did not work for Rott,The bristles were too far spaced out to work on my rott/pitt mix. It didn't seem to grab there hair that I needed and just turned into a toy for the pup as it was no use to me. This would probably be much better on dogs with thicker coats.
4,It works!,Bought this for my Lab who is shedding a lot! Tons of hair came off of him. I was very impressed. Decided to use it in our Boxer whom I thought hardly sheds. I was totally shocked at how much hair came off of her. I recommend brushing the dogs outside because the hair does fly off everywhere. Glad all of that hair came off outside instead of my house!!!
5,Great brush for a Dalmatian!,"My husband and I have a Dalmatian, which other owners will know can shed profusely at times. In packs, Dalmatians clean one another, and shedding isn't a problem, but on their own it can be a huge pain in the butt.Our little guy has been leaving his fur on the furniture, in the carpet, and floating in the air since about 6 months old.I've tried every kind of brush I could think of, even the very highly ranked Furminators, which only seemed to hurt his skin. The work great on dogs with longer hair, but Jack's coat is too fine and short for them. Then I saw a YouTube video of a guy brushing his Dalmatian with one of these Zoom Groom brushes, so I went out and got one.Best 8 bucks I've ever spent on Jack. It pulls out all the loose hair without hurting his skin. Even better, he actually likes it!Definitely a great brush for a short haired dog. I use it on our cat, too, and he also seems to enjoy it."
4,Good pad that met our need,"We have one of those hard wood benches and we used this pad on it. Not extactly what is was meant for, the shape being a little off, but it really makes sitting on the bench for long periods much more comfortable."
2,not what I hoped for,"Audra has a great voice, and is a great performer, but as good as she is I have a hard time listening to just this CD. I think it would be great mixed in with other music... create a mix, put it on your mp-3 and enjoy.I still give it a thumbs up."
3,I'll Keep Listening,"Her debut CD, ""Way Back to Paradise"", knocked my socks off. ""How Glory Goes"" has me snoozing. She can't touch Judy Garland on ""The Man that Got Away"" and Barbara Streisand sticks in my mind on ""A Sleeping Bee"". I do like ""I Won't Mind"", a sweet song that showcases Ms. McDonald's pure and lovely voice. But so much of this CD alternates between screams and whispers for me. I delight in Ms. McDonald, truly, and I know given her youth and great talent, she has plenty more to show and tell us through the lyrics and music to come. So I'll keep listening and waiting. I still applaud the beauty and boldnesss of this African American songstress."
2,"Beautiful, But Somewhat Bland","When I first recieved this CD as a present, I was overjoyed. Audra McDonald has been my favorite female singer since I heard her sing: the sheer emotion in her voice completely blew me away. For that reason, I was disappointed in this CD. Only in two songs does McDonald use even a fraction of the emotional potential I feel is in her voice, and in many songs her voice is comparatively bland. Wonderful talent, not-so-wonderful CD."
2,Overrated talent and snoozer of a CD,"In my opinion, this woman is one of the most overrated singers of our generation. Theres no arguing that she has a beautiful classically trained soprano voice, as do many other broadway stars, but her range is very limited. Hand her something broadway or something classical and she's right at home, but she fails at anything else. With her reputation, you'd think she would steal the Dreamgirls concert; however, she was the weakest element, appearing totally miscast and even lost. I'd imagine that any serious forays into the pop world would be even worse. Not that she has to crossover of course, but I do believe the Streisand comparisons are an exaggeration. She is an excellent actress though.Nearly every song on this CD sounds the same, slow songs bereft of energy or passion. Certainly buy this CD if you are a big broadway fan (chances are most of them already own it) but others should probably pass."
2,Golden Ears,"A Moose from California compared Audra's ""Bill"" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!!!"
5,An Excellent Encore,"I had the pleasure of seeing an meeting Audra in Ann Arbor, MI (Go Blue!) recently and this collection captures the essence of her beautiful voice and personality. While I prefer the more up-tempo, fun songs (not too many on here), the CD is, overall, very satisfying."
5,A Great CD!,"This cd is great! Audra McDonald was amazing in the 1994 revival of ""Carousel"" and in ""Ragtime"", and she is even better on her latest solo album. She has chosen great songs from the 20's, 50's, 90's and new songs to sing. She sings everything from ""The Man that Got Away""(A Star is Born) to ""Bill""(Showboat) to ""Somewhere""(West Side Story). She has an amazing voice and amazing control over it. When she wants to, she can belt just as good as Barbara Streisand, and in a split second she can go back to a whisper. Buy this cd and be impressed with Audra McDonald's voice. You will be glad you did. Enjoy!"
4,"Try ""Way Back to Paradise"" first.","""How Glory Goes"" is a beautiful CD. McDonald makes thesestandard show tunes her own. The track ""When did I fall in Love"" from the Broadway show Fiorello is a total knock out. However, compared to her album ""Way Back to Paradise,"" this album is not as interesting or original because the material is so familiar. I don't know if anything could top the beautiful and edgy ""art songs"" on McDonald's first solo album. If you are up for more of a listening challenge, try ""Way Back to Paradise"" first. That one is totally five stars plus, in my view."
5,"Don Knotts, Reluctant Hero","The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is the best movie ever made. This series is just fun, fun fun. THX, jpb"
1,DVD damaged,"I was so excited about getting this 4 movie DVD pack. The very first movie, ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"", was damaged half way through, the movie froze and we were unable to finish watching it. We tried cleaning the dvd, and we used the fine tuning on our brand new DVD player, but nothing helped. We were extremely disappointed."
1,Glitch filled DVD,"This review only pertains to the DVD itself, and not the titles on it (which are great.) My DVD was plagued with freeze ups, skips, and sound problems. From what I have seen in reviews of other Universal DVDs, this is a common problem for Universal DVDs. The titles on this box set are great, I only wish Universal was not so cheap, and put out a 4-DVD set instead of trying to compress all 4 movies on one DVD. If so much had not been crammed onto one disk, then perhaps these glitches would not exsist."
5,love my comedy,"im old school, id almost forgotton how funny don knotts was. im glad i found it on amazon, hope to find an buy more!!!!!!!!"
3,DonKnotts 4 Movie,"In my opinion Don Knotts was one of the funniest comedians ever to live. Some of the movies are corny, but Don Knott's expressions and actions are as priceless as the ones he portrayed as ""Barney Fife"" on the Andy Griffin show."
5,Love Don Knotts,"We got these for our grandkids. We love the innocent humor of the ""good ole days"". Great for young and older audiences."
4,Knotts collection,"Reluctant Astronaut became stuck on in the begining, other than that the rest was fine. Enjoyed the Movies he is a very funny man. Every home should have one.RD"
3,DVD prone to glitches,It's a matter of DVD to player compatabilty. My Toshiba plays the disc perfectly but my Panasonic doesn't. Universal should recall this disc and issue one with two discs so that more players can play it.I love these old movies and they deserve better treatment.
5,Funny stuff!,My kids just love Don Knotts and they enjoy watching his movies over and over. These are great for long trips.
5,hero pack,don knotts is a great actor full of laughs don knotts 4 movie reluctant hero pack has got alot of good movies on it
3,Don Knotts 4 Pack,"This would be a better package if The Love God was replaced by a more family oriented film, such as How to Frame a Figg. The first three movies are terrific, but ""Love God"" really doesn't belong in this package."
4,2 out of 4 are good--still a great deal!,"My dad and I love The Ghost and Mr. Chicken! It is the reason we bought this dvd. However, the Shakiest Gun in the West is also very funny. The Reluctant Astronaut is mildly funny. but not nearly as good as the first two mentioned. We chose not to watch The Love God, but this dvd is still a great deal!"
2,still fun to watch,Iremember watching these films with my dad as a child and thinking that these are some clean fun films to watch with my own kids so I ordered them. They are still fun to watch and I wish more movies could be made like these clean and fun.
4,Great for All Don Knotts fans,Fun walk down memory lane. Should probably be a fan if you buy this....
5,Looks good,Product received as expected and on time. Looks great in my white shower stall with my other brass plated items.
4,A Compilation of Fine Performances,"ASV has brought together three of Weber's works it had previously released on separate CDs. Emma Johnson's contribution in the quintet and clarinet concerto have been praised by many critics for their grace and feeling. Marriner's recording of the first symphony should be found equally satisfying, though as many have noted, the strings seem at times over-bright. Still, a great collection of Weber for anyone interested in looking into this composer (beyond his best known work, the opera Der Freischutz)."
3,British pronunciation is major problem,"This is a good series for getting started speaking Japanese if you have the CD and ignore the pronunciation guides that give vowel sounds based on british speech. An example is ""o is pronounced like the o in hot"", when it is actually a long ""o"" as in hole. At the very least, they should have a disclaimer at the beginning of the book stating that american speakers need to look elsewhere for pronuncition. All of the Japanese dialog is spoken correctly as far as I can tell, but the English speakers didn't bother to learn how to say the Japanese words and names that they say in their introductions. It makes it very difficult to know which things in the series are correct & worth learning, and which are bad habits. I gave it three stars because it is a mixed bag. Definitely don't bother getting this book unless you get the CD with it."
2,THE PACKAGE IS BETTER THAN THE CHOCOLATE,I purchased five of these bars... in part to offset the very high cost of shipping. I anticipated that these would be truly superior chocolate. In reality it's OK stuff pretending to be much better than it is. In short: it's way too expensive and not really very special.
2,Nothing Special,"I ordered these chocolates because I saw them used on the Martha Stewart Show. They were touted as one of the best chocolates around. I ordered several (to offset shipping costs). They arrived in excellent condition (packaged well, remained intact). Because they are so expensive I expected pure bliss, but found them to be just okay. Not compelled to order again."
2,It's OK.,"It touches the subject of RFID rather generically, but it doesn't come close to exhausting the subject on any specific level or in any specific branch of RFID. It seems to bounce too much between very basic knowledge and professional expertise. Someone with electronic or electrical background will be annoyed with erroneous expressions like ""these tags may be deactivated by 'burning out' the resonant circuit with a massive induced voltage"" (in section 3.5) - it should say ""current"" instead of ""voltage.""""RFID Essentials"" triggers reflection on the near future and how the spread of RFID tagging of things might eventually jeopardize personal privacy.Overall: the book could be way over the head for a non-expert and it would not expand the knowledge of a professional in the field, I think."
5,Concise and informative,"O'Reilly books tend to be informative and to the point. This book is no different. It's does exactly what the title says - provides you with the information essential to learn about RFID systems.The authors explain the essential concepts of RFID systems starting with the physical layer and build on it. In a whirlwind fashion this book covers how tags work, how tags and reader communicate, how readers work, RFID middleware, data management, system manaegement and application intergration. The book does a remarkable job of explaining some of the more complex concepts like backscatter, tag encodings and event filtering. The concepts are then tied into architectural considerations and recommendations. RFID is a broad topic and this book offers something for everyone.What I liked the most about this book is that it steers clear of the hype that seems to have surrounded the RFID market. Highly recommended!"
3,RFID - Simplifying the concepts.,Brings concepts and applications in a very simple language providing a easy understanding. There are several practical cases that serve as a practical demonstration. Allows a quick reading to deepening in more specific books and more technical content.
3,Perhaps a bit dated,"Based on the date, I knew this book would not say anything about NFC standard. I bought it hoping it would include some discussion of ISO 14443 and its relation to Mifare, but apparently those standards came out after the book was published."
5,THIS OUTSTANDING BOOK WAS A LIFESAVER,"When I brought my son home from the week long stay at the hospital, I was overwhelmed by the thought of properly handling his needs with the one hour orientation and pamphlets we received. This book was truly a lifesaver. It not only gave me the encouragement I needed, but along with the excellent information on handling daily situations, diet, exercise, etc. came the knowledge of the emergency glucagon kit. I subsequently, firmly requested the kit over objections by his former doctor, and was able to prevent a trip to the ER. Upon receiving further training, I learned that the information from this mom who's been there far exceeded the info from the diabetes educator. Hugs and cudos to Virginia Nasmyth Loy and her sons."
1,Don't let the saucy cover fool you... EDITED,"CMX's statement on the back of these manga that they only publish ""100% Pure Manga"" is an outright false statement, because this book is edited to the extent that it is difficult to understand character motivations, dialogue or behaviour.Heartily recommended only to buy as a gift if you want to make your Manga reading pals angry at you for buying it for them. You are wasting your money with this title, it really is that bad.A shame, too. Could have been so much more."
5,Amazing,"Love this bra! It is amazing, even for larger breasted women. I wear a 32DD and it is supported, beautiful and my favorite bra."
3,Not great,The tip is of a brittle plastic and the threads that the tip screws onto is weak. I am a college sutudent and thoses tips keep breaking in my backpack. But I guess if you aren't rough with them they will last a while.
2,Stupid rubber grip...,"I was given one of the old version, without the rubber, in fourth grade. That was 13 years ago, and I still use it. Only now is it starting to have problems, and now I can't find a replacement. I bought one'a them newfangled rubberized ones a year ago, and it's degraded completely already: the rubber has turned sticky and soft. It's like writing with half-dried play-doh. Why did they do this to a perfectly good pencil? Moreover, why did they stop making the good kind??I've been searching the internet all night, and I can't find anyone selling the original model. If anybody knows where one might be found, do tell.Rubber grip = crap. 'Nuff said."
4,Dual learning experience with dual language book,"Good book! Great to learn a little about the culture while also learning/improving my spanish vocabularly and understanding. I think it's great to incorporate reading spanish in order to attempt to fully understand the language. I liked this book in doing so, but it would be nice if there was a gradual immersion into all of the new words. I've also looked into verb books which I think would be very beneficial as there are some conjugated verbs that you can't find in the dictionary because their so different from the original word. Plus, I've heard this is very beneficial in really learning to be fluent...Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Verb Tenses by Dorothy Devney"
2,Thoroughness Does Not Equal Excellence,"If there was ever a story that exists pre-packaged as a compelling narrative, it is the story of Pol Pot. Mr. Short has somehow managed to reduce this dramatic historical episode to a mind-numbing list of names, dates and places. Everything relating to how this as a wrenching human experienece seems to have been methodically removed to the point that it reads like a 500-page atlas index. It is very thoroughly written. Every detail in Pol Pot's life and career that is possible to know seems to have been discovered and documented........and turned into an extremely boring book."
5,great,"got the package as soon as i needed it, the book was great and very helpful for the paper i was writing. thanks!"
2,Lost in too many irrelevant details,"Mr.Short has done a terrific job identifying the fact pattern of historical events, documenting and describing them with astonishing accuracy. However, Mr.Short gets in too many details that are irrelevant when it comes to describing a concise and clear story about Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge regime. Definitely, this is not a book for a first-time reader on Pol Pot's Cambodia who wants to understand the global picture of such a human catastrophe."
3,Yawn,I am sorry but this book was boring. I think it took a special kind of writer to make something as seemingly interesting/horrific as the Khmer Rouge so dull. This book is overloaded with details upon details that do not really give any real insights into what happened in Cambodia or upon Pol Pot.This is not the first book someone should read to get a strong understanding of Pol Pot or the Khmer Rouge. Instead it should be read by people that are serious students of this subject otherwise you will just get bogged down with names and the little bureaucratic nuances of the Khmer Rouge step by painful step.This book has taken me a long time to read through and I generally read pretty quickly. I would find myself cleaning my house or doing laundry to avoid finishing. I am one of those people that feels they need to finish a book once they started it and this one made me seriously reconsider.
5,Fantastic!,"This is one of the BEST documentaries I have ever seen, tied only with _Why We Fight_ and _Heart of Stone_._Soldiers of Conscience_ is touching, inspiring, and educational. I was perhaps most impressed with how *balanced* it was! I would love to see this film shared with more and more people! I believe that anyone can find him or herself represented in this film, and represented well."
3,For Die-Hard Syd Fans Only!,"I enjoyed the disc and book, although some of the material is also on thePiper At The Gates Of Dawn DVD. Not the place to start for new fans, but aSyd obsessive will appreciate the removal of Roger Waters from the Hans Keller interview, more information on Syd's state of mind at the time he recorded his solo albums, and the absence of the critics and their opinions, which, for such a small body of output, was often redundant andunnecessary and speculative on previous similar discs. What is needed is for a DVD which includes all known Syd footage, free of the talking heads and cutaways, and inclusive of what Pink Floyd have in their archives."
2,syd barrett : up close and personal,"i was quite disappointed because there wasnt alot of footage of syd, i found the film boring, i learned nothing new about syd. if your a new fan of barretts you might like the film. any hard core fans avoid!"
4,Globalization is complex,"I disagree with the other reviewers. The study of anthropology often creates more questions than answers--that is why the field intrigues me. As for the reviewer wanting a simpler treatment of the subject... Fine in theory, but globalization is COMPLEX. The introduction of the book offers some themes to observe and asserts that 1) Globalization is not only about passive receivers of global imperialism. 2) Global ideas and products flow in many ways (not just core to the periphery). 3) Many circuits of globalization circumvent the west (or global north). The subsequent chapters then follow these threads.I come from a critical background (i.e. that globalization is evil), but the examples in the book show that not all aspects of globalization are troubling. As for Appadurai and invention of words... keep giving the chapter another read. The man is simply (complexly?) a beautiful writer."
1,What's that smell?,"...sadly, it is my underarms. This product just does not work. And things start to stink within an hour. I have tried other natural deodorants, and was pretty happy. This was my failed attempt to give something new a try. I am tossing this one and going back to my old brand."
2,A bit disappointed,This product did not work as well as I had hoped. It seemed to wear off rather quickly so I had to keep reapplying quite often. I will not purchase this again but go with the Miessence that worked a whole lot better.
4,"Good, but not the best by far","Cradle of Filth is one of my all-time favorite bands so I'm a little biased when it comes to them. I think that if you're a fan of them you'll like this EP way more than if you're just a casual listener. If you're looking to get into them I would start with Dusk and Her Embrace (my personal fave). Being that this is a small EP, is doesn't really show all they're capable of, especially considering that half the songs on here are covers. Oh, and if you're looking for the companion video, PanDaemonAeon, it's kind of a waste. The music video is good, but the making of featurette seems like filler and the live footage isn't that great."
3,"Good, but not great...but it's an EP","You cant rate this to high, since it's only a EP with some remixes, covers, and few new songs.The cover of The Misfit's ""Death Comes Calling"" is brillant.It's the perfect song for Cradle to cover.Sleepness is also very good, a slow , driving bass line dominates the song that is just very eerie.Thew few new songs are ok, but not great.As for the remixes, many are decent but not great.Short album, just a holdover till their new album came out (which it did, and it was Midian I believe), so dont expect to much if you're a new Cradle fan, but if you've been a fan of the band for awhile, then you'll find it satisfying."
3,How disappointing.....,"After 4 succesfull albums... It is almost easy to understand! COF has changed their line-up in each and every album, eventhough their music was even better on each one. As soon as their drummer (Nicholas Barker) was replace... well, now you get it. You only got to wait next Dimmu Borgir's still unnamed album in which will feature their new drummer... Nicholas Barker."
4,CoF EP,"Its good to see that the UK can still offer decent forms of extreme music, even if we can only manage a few bands, of which Cradle are the most prominent. This is a cute little EP release, with substantial material on it to satisfy the loyal fans between albums- a good record showcasing what Cradle are known for- Dani's screeching wail, the thunderous drumming and heavy riffing any heavy group would be proud of."
3,"Decent, but not worth the price","It must be said that EPs (this and the new one, ""Bitter Suites to Succubi"") have always been a weak point for Cradle of Filth nowadays, and ""From The Cradle To Enslave"" is no exception.Only a few songs are worth listening to on here (the title track, Of Dark Blood And F******, Sleepless, Dawn Of Eternity) because the band never fails when it comes to writing their own songs. But the cover song (Death Comes Ripping) and the remix for ""Funeral In Carpathia"" are terribly lame. The only covers that the band has gotten right are Iron Maiden's ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" (AWESOME) and Venom's ""Black Metal"", which can be found on the 2 CD version of ""Cruelty & The Beast"".Bottom line: If you MUST listen to this EP, check out the title track and ""Of Dark Blood And F******"" (which wouldn't have been out of place on Cruelty & The Beast, as with ""Sleepless)."
3,Well here is how I see it.,"First off, don't let this review fool you. I've been a cof fan since 1999. I love this band, they got me into Black Metal and pretty much the first stepping stone into extreme metal. However, instead of giving a cliche they sold out htis roadrunner that blah blah blah review. I think i'll put it simply like this.Back when I was a young kid, i had a group of friends. There weren't many of us, we didn't have huge really big birthday parties or anything. We weren't popular or anything. However, we were young (friends for 5 years, from 8-13) my best friend was named Ben. ben was liked by everybody in our group. However, one day he woke up and started acting like everybody e lse, just like the popular kids. Started betraying who he really was and who he once was. He was now accepted by the masses of kids in middle school and had many new friends. However, we hated him at this point. Cradle of Filth, are sorda like Ben."
2,Stay Away!!!!,"how can i say this nicely? I cant. this EP sucks to put it simply, the title track is repetetive the rest suck except for Funeral in Carpathia which sounds identical to the original. However every band has at least one bad release let us hope this is CoF's one and only."
2,"Not COF's best, by a long shot.","First off, the cover of the misfits sucks. It lacks what would otherwise make it great, also known as emotion and feeling. Also, the remake of Funeral In Carpathia totally ruins the song. It takes out the darkness and makes it a cheesy satire of its former self. It lacks the emotion and grimness that made the original so haunting. Also, the title track sucks. It lack a good central driving theme, and instead it sounds like the songwriters were running out of ideas. However, Dawn Of Eternity was a worthy song, and so was the cover of Sleepless, so it doesn't totally suck. However, Of Dark Blood And F**king is not really a worthy track, and this MCD is really prophetic of troubles to come."
3,Only 2 new tracks,"This is a record-company EP, not a band EP. There are only 2 new Cradle songs (the first two), followed by a bunch of cover versions. The remix of Funeral in Carpathia is not worth bothering with. Get this on Napster; don't waste your money unless you're really a die-hard fan. Save it for their next studio album, when it arrives."
3,Only 1 pack came,"I love chapstick, but be careful when you order! You should receive a total of 36 sticks, but I got one bundle of 4 packs of 3. The wording on the product is very strange so there may be confusion when packing your product. I have to return it, and now it is backordered. I paid $32 and only received a total of 12 sticks. Make sure you check the package as soon as you get it!"
1,only 12 NOT 36!!!!!!,"Customer service told me to return, would noy give 36 at the 37.44 cost; even though it says 1.04 a stick!Very disappointed!"
5,Not much to say,"My wife and I go through a lot of ChapStick. I don't really care about brand but she insists on the original ChapStick flavor (or lack of flavor). Hard to find, and this is at a price (if your willing to buy a lot at one time) that is very agreeable."
2,flimsy stool,"i bought 5 of these as a cheap series of set pieces for a play. They look cool, but 2 of the the 5 broke almost immediately. I sat in one and it broke. I tip the scales at a grand 210; 40 lbs. less than the 250 lbs these are rated to hold."
3,OK,"nice watch but it looks cheap (what you do not see on the picture...); the functions are OK, the provided manual was wrong"
5,Where have I been?,"All my distortion/overdrive needs are covered by the Deucetone.Light overdrive and/or heavy overdrive when cascaded. The clean RAT fattens up the tone great so with single coils it really makes a difference, I like the Dirty RAT on A and Vintage RAT on B for humbuckers for cascading and the Dirty on A and Vintage on B for single coils.Great string separation, dynamic, cleans up great, works great with any pickup. I can't believe I spent years looking for something to sound like my RAT or to push my RAT. Well, this does it.It is built in the USA and it's solid as a rock. Solid and heavy."
2,Can't review what I haven't received,"I ordered my subscription in July. Here it is mid-September and I have not yet received one issue, and I'm wondering if I ever will. Other reviewers say it's a great magazine. I'll have to take their word for it. I'm a little miffed at how long it's taking to be delivered."
5,A GREAT US Rally book!,"The late Tom Grimshaw was always an effective, entertaining story teller and this book about John Buffum and the early days of stateside stage rally competition is a 'must read' for any true rally fan, American or not. Written by the man who teamed with ""JB"" to win many rallys and titles, the book is as 'inside' a look at our sport as is available. Buy it! Read it! Display it and then read it again!M. E. ""Mad Mike"" HalleyRally driver, 1977 - present"
2,More Housewives at Play (v. 2),"I bought this just to see what kind of approach the author would take to this subject (OK, and some titillation also). It proved to be not too interesting."
1,Ugh!,"Stupid me...I thought I was purchasing a book that involved a storyline. WRONG! This ""book"" is nothing but a bunch of cartoons with NO words in it.If you're a fan of adult cartoons, then this book is for you. If you're looking for an erotic book with actual words in it, then look elsewhere."
4,Unusual and eyecatching,"People always compliment this pendant when I wear it and think it's from a boutique or more ""exclusive"" shop. I have the matching earrings and have been very pleased with the set. Though I read the dimensions, I didn't quite calculate them into a real-life size, and initially the pendant was smaller than I expected, but after putting it on, it's just right."
1,A Complete Ripoff,I ordered what I thought was 12 packages of .7 Pentel pencil leads for $5.99. Even the summary of my order says there are 12 pieces in my shipment. What a shock to find out that the 12 pieces were the 12 leads that were in the package! This would have cost around a dollar (or less) anywhere else and I paid $6 for it (plus shipping of $15 or so to get it the next day). So I have one package of 12 pencil leads that I paid $20 for. This is just wrong!
2,disappointment,"I love this watch. Its just the style and price I had been looking for. The watch itself is nice and works fine but after receiving it I noticed scratches around the bulova logo on the clasp that closes the watch band to wrist. I e-mailed Jomashop and they responded back by informing me I was past the 5 day return policy. I wasn't! I've worn the watch several times and love the way it looks. No one else sees the sratches, but it is something I know is there so it takes alittle enjoyment out of it for me.Guess I'll get over it. My first time ordering jewelry off internet and my last."
3,"For limit holdem players, not for No Limit holdem players","the book is the reprint of a number of articles published by the author over time. It is well written, and the information is definitely of high calibre. It is however best used by limit holdem players; as no limit holdem strategy differs widely from limit strategy.With that proviso in mind, i think those interested will find their dollars recieve fair value from the author."
2,Takamine EG128SC,The guitar is beautiful but came with a defect. The retailer service was great when I had to return it but bought the same product again through another retailer and it has an annoying rattle that shouldn`t be there and Takamine doesn`t hold any responsibility for that so I wouldn`t recommend it for its price and benefit...
1,Don't bother.,"This ""documentary"" popped up in one of my Netflicks queues. Since it's a subject that interests me, I decided to watch it. I made it about thirty minutes in before I had to give up. The horrible production and absolute lack of any content was bad enough, but the fact that they basically arbitrarily decided that a couple of serial killers were "" the devil's offspring"" because they were conceived on ""Satanic Holidays"" .I can't state enough how BAD this whole thing was...to be fair, mostly because I couldn't stomach sitting through more than 28 minutes of it."
3,Definitely a band to watch,"It's hard to do justice to Veal in any simple description. Terms like power-pop or post-punk are as inevitable as they are inaccurate, although a quirky, genial mix of the two is right on target. ""Tilt O'Whirl"" obstinately follows its own slack muse through balladry, gloom, boogie, pop, and anything else that fell off the table the night before. Defining moments: the fake blues of ""Po' Black Child"" is a borderline offense - and all the cooler for it - and ""Skid"" is better Ben Folds than Ben Folds probably ever thought possible."
5,brilliant,"this CD is great, enabling us to hear rare tracks which we will surely never get on vinyl~ only problem ~ the amazon price is about two times it's price in the UK!"
5,Trifle Bowl and Chip/Dip Server,What a deal. I gave this to 2 of my friends for Christmas. They loved them. What a nice keepsake.
2,Needs an eraser.,"This is a fabulous pencil-- except that I use a pencil when I write something that must be erasable.The tiny eraser of Dr. Grip is inadequate for me, and covered with a small metal cap which must be removed and kept in a safe place while I erase.I chose Dr. Grip while searching for a pencil that could accommodate my increasingly arthritic fingers. Dr. Grip does that well-- it is comfortable to hold and allows me to write a long time without fatigue. However, I enjoy the same level of comfort with the Papermate PhD, which has an always-ready twist-up eraser that lasts forever.A fabulous pencil for many, but not a good choice for me."
4,Writes Smooth,This is my favorite mechanical pencil. It writes smooth like a pen and is comfortable to hold. I have had mine for 5 years and it is still in great condition and working great.
4,the hash kicks!,"wow, what can i say about this cd? the lyrics are incredible, the guitars and drums are phenomenal, and roger's singing is unbelieveable. if you like ltj, punk, or just music in general, pick this up.the only problem, which is what keeps me from giving this 5 stars, is that it is incredibly short. at just over 24 minutes, expect to have these songs on repeat A LOT, because you will want to hear them over and over, not just for the lack of length, but also for the quality of the music on here.if you are stll apprehensive about it, you can go to purevolume.com/rehasher and stream the entire album. after you do that, im sure you will want to pick it up."
3,Parte II?,Cuando compre este DVD crei que recibiria EL carte segunda temporada pero lo que recibi es el segundo set de DVD's de la primera temporada. Aqui no dice que es la segunda parte de la primera temporada. Lo que yo buscaba es la continuacion de la segunda temporada. Bote mi dinero a la basura por que ya vi esta parte!!! cuidado con lo que ordenan!
4,"Poignant, heartwarming rich characterization","A very special first-person childs-eye view of life in Hawaii in pre-Pearl Harbor Hawaii. It's a wonderful and unique story, sometimes very funny, rich in descriptions of places and people leading up to and during a highly dramatic historical event. I gave it only 4 stars because I prefer stories that are more tightly woven, and I felt that there were a few inconsistencies in the narrative. Still, 4 stars for a first novel is definitely well above average and a worth-while read for anyone who loves children and their views on life in a dysfunctional family. Add the settings of Hawaii in 1940-41, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and a child's loss of innocence to the mix, and, well, read it for yourself!"
5,"if you are a singer, and admire sprituals this is your source","i love spirituals and especially for a bass/baritone, the spiritual is a form that allows the low voice to shine. i purchased this work and have begun to enjoy working from sheet music with songs that previously, i only had the words, and maybe a recording to learn from.not much else to say. if you want to see how spiritual looked when they were first transcribed for musicians, this is a one stop source."
3,Haven't used it much,I wanted to learn the old Negro Spirituals because I love the way they sing them. I don't do them justice as a Norwegian American.
1,Blomus let me down on this one,"Although, I didn't purchase this product from Amazon.com, I feel the need to review this product.Aesthetically the holder is great, but functionally, it is very subpar. I would not recommend this holder. Since 85% of it is hard stainless steel, it will and can scratch your cell phone if you're not careful enough. Even with a thin layer of rubber/foam in the cradle, it is not enough protection.I nearly got electrocuted with this holder. I removed the rubber gasket which helped to allow the phone plug to connect to an electrical outlet better(more snug). By doing so, the metal of the holder contacted the metal of the phone plug prongs which sent sparks flying and fried my phone charger plug and nearly caused a fire.DO NOT REMOVE THE RUBBER GASKET! No way no how."
4,Good book based on biblical leadership,"I had the opportunity to take a class by Dr. Black, and this book was a recommended read. It is an easy read with biblically based and practical applications for a leader in her daily life."
4,Everyone needs Encouragement!,"Sabrina Black gives us a God-inspired look into how leaders of all kinds can better lead without going crazy. Leaders almost always have moments of feeling overwhelmed, this book is a great guide to help you deal with those feelings and continue to give direction, help, motivation and encouragement to others."
2,Not so wonderful,I bought 3 of thoses mechpencils from pentel and I have problems with corrosion and lose of the metallic grip due to weakness of the conection between the barrel and the loose grip. The other problems is because the barrel is not tight enough making sometimes the leads fall out of the pencil when you pull it quickly from pocket.
5,"best mechanical pencil, used throughout high school and college","I've been using this pencil for years. It has a very sturdy and balanced feel, and none have ever failed me. It does not waste much lead at the end. Also, I am addicted to the precision of the 0.5mm. In addition, the eraser is a very practical length so you don't need to replace it every month. The only reason I've ever had to buy new ones was because kids in high school would either steal them, or I'd lose them. The one I have now has been with me for 3 years, and the lead hasn't slipped once. I've tried many others pencils, but this is my all-time favorite that I've used for years.I highly recommend this buy. For just 6 bucks (how easily is that spent anyway?), you'll get a great pencil that will last you for years. Just don't lend them out -- people tend to like them a little too much! :)"
5,New favorite,"These pencils have become my new favorite - everyone at work likes them so much, I have lost my spares to my office mates and need to order more. Best eraser and eraser mechanism of any of the mechanical pencils I have used, plus the pencil mechanism is one of the few that keeps 0.5 lead from easily breaking, and it seems to be pretty durable as well. Quite happy with this item!"
5,totally engaging,"I've owned this Barbirolli recording of Vaughan Williams' 5th for more than 30 years, originally as an Angel LP & now as an EMI cd, & I treasure it. I also own readings by Boult & Previn which are very fine as well; however, Barbirolli seems to best communicate the spiritual elements of this great music. In short, I cannot recommend this recording highly enough - it never fails to elevate me. (The reading of Tintagel on this disc is also exceptional.)"
4,Patterns not included,"When I originally bought this book I was under the impression the patterns were included, this was not the case.However, the book teaches you how to draft your own patterns and how to sew them once drafted. It is good for a base and meant for intermediate to seasoned sewers. Beginners might have a hard time with a few bits of the book if they are new to drafting but I find that she makes it almost easy to understand.I really like this book and it was worth the buy but I do wish there were patterns included."
3,"Pretty, not practical","Although this book has the beautiful layout of all Taunton books, it unfortunately lacks clarity. Many techniques desribed left me pondering how they actually work. The book does have some good general advice on selecting fabrics, and some possible ways to personalize your work. It might be worth a look, but the author seems to have some trouble when it comes to specific explanations.I'd be interested to see if anyone could figure out how to do a ""turned lace hem"" from the instructions."
5,What Traditional Jujutsu is SUPPOSED to Look Like,"I saw one of the reviews on this page that gave the book one star because he said it looked more like karate than jujutsu...which tells me right there that this person (the reviewer) has no clue what real jujutsu is all about. Because of Brazilian JJ and mixed-martial arts too maybe folks today think Jujutsu is all about rolling around on the floor; but a study of the traditional ryu shows that atemi-waza (striking) and keri-waza (kicking) were ALWAYS significant parts of the art. How much of an idiot would a samurai (the originators of the art) have been if they did matwork on the battlefield? For them it was all hit, move, hit, kill, move.Shihan Maberry's fine book, ULTIMATE JUJUTSU, captures this very well, and perhaps for the first time in a book not written by a Japanese. Also, it includes some of the techniques I had to be be in jujutsu for 20 years to learn.Overall: five golden stars from this jujutsuka. Osu!"
4,The best classical Jujutsu book,Ultimate Jujutsu: Principles & Practice is the best classical Jujutsu book on the market. The book is self-defense concepted with real advices from the autor. At the end of the book there is Japanese Martial Arts Dictionary and a useful short explanation of the other martial arts - Japanese and others.
1,More karate than jujitsu,I really didn't see a lot of real jujitsu in this book. He obviously studied a modern system rooted in karate.
1,Not so hot,"I had a problem with tis phone from the get-go. Bad range, and cheap all the way around. I had to return it for mechanical reasons."
3,"""The Remote"" is NOT the same band as ""R3mote""","""The Remote"" is NOT the same band as ""R3mote""""The Remote"" is NOT the same band as ""R3mote""The album pictured ""Too Low to Miss"" is from ""the remote"" and is in my humble opinion uninspired take on something along the lines of the Stone Roses and Moby's illegitimate child on a whole bucket full of marginal veterinary grade barbiturates. I am not amused.R3mote has one EP on Rotters Golf Club called ""Remotion"" so far."
4,I don't like Indian food but....,"Made three recipes from this cookbook for company who like Indian food. I loved all three dishes, particularly the unusual version of Tandoori chicken,and now am hooked. Can't wait to try more recipes and go the restaurant."
3,East Indian Cooking,"I have tried several of the recipes from the book and all met or exceeded my expectations. A word of caution. Unless you have access to a pretty good supply of Indian herbs and spices, you are not going to be able to replicate most of the recipes found here. They are not what you would find at Safeway. Also, the author assumes the reader is not just a casual cook. There is a significant amount of prep work involved which is pretty common for this style of cooking. But that said, most require a good amount of work."
4,A Classic,"Although this recording maintains standard performance cuts, it still rates among the very best recordings of this opera. The sound is quite good for it's age although at times the singers drown out the orchestra. But what singers they are! Alda Noni is perfect as Norina - sly, witty in character and lovely vocally. The late Cesare Valletti proves himself a worthy successor to Tito Schipa with his gentle pianissimi and comic timing. Sesto Bruscantini's light baritone makes the title role more vulnerable and less purely buffo than most other interpreters. When struck by ""Sofronia"" you can feel great sympathy for him. Mario Rossi conducts with a restraint which is uncommon in this opera - but most welcome as it allows the wonderful tunes to flow forth.If you are looking for an uncut recording of this opera you should consider looking elsewhere (EMI's recording with Beverly Sills, for one)but if you're looking for a fabulous interpretation then look no further!"
5,beautiful arc lamp,I wanted to purchase an arc lamp for over my Tommy Bahama Sofa. It was the only rattan arc lamp I could find on the internet. When it arrived I put it together myself; it was very easy and looks fantastic behind my sofa. It also thows lots of light for reading. Eveyone who walks into my house makes a comment on how perfect it looks in the space. Great buy for an unusual lamp.
4,Forward in All Directions,"This is what I imagine Frank Zappa may have sounded like had he been born on Mars. If you like musicianship, eclectic sounds, and have an easy sense of humor you will like this. Apparently they have a large and devoted following. Search ""3 Mustaphas 3""."
2,The main story is fine but...,"The main story of this book is good, in the present time is very good and will keep you reading, but the past time, the biographies, the introduction to each chapters is very slow and boring, it goes out of the main story so many tiems that I really don't know why I finished this book, the end of it will not let you leave the book if you get to that part, it has some mistakes like why Anna wanted the main story if she already has it."
2,Disappointing novel about Russia and identity,"Elizabeth Adler's ""Property of a Lady"" is one of the more disappointing of her novels. The book itself is easily 100 pages too long with a kind of dumb heroine in the present time(Genie Reese). Genie's actions in this novel could have easily killed her, especially one you learn her secret connection with the other heroine, Missie Abrams O'Bryan(aka Verity Byron). Missie is an admirable woman, who survived through the Russian Revolution and the Great Depression. She also knows all the Ivanoff secrets which a megalomanic German and a sadistic Russian will kill to get. Almost all the main characters in the novel have multiple identies, and this is an interesting part of the novel, but the prose is a bit flat, and Genie is just plain unlikable, which is this novel's fatal flaw. The previous book ""Rich Shall Inherit"" was better."
1,Worst Elizabeth Adler book ever!,"This book is so bad I couldn't finish it. It jumps back and forth in time so much that the reader gets confused. The dates in time are never given so one had to keep returning to the beginning of the book. Also, I got to the middle of the book and STILL nothing had happened. I finally quit this book in disgust. I am a HUGE fan of Elizabeth Adler, but to me, this book was a waste of both my time and my money."
5,Really Enjoyed it!,"I really enjoyed this book and really couldn't put it down. The author did a fabulous job of mixing the past with the present in the storytelling. I read A LOT and although I'm not sure why I loved this book, but there was just something about it!"
1,Boring,"This book is really dull. The plot was tacky, the characters were standard caricatures. There wasn't any suspense at all. You could guess what was going to happen next. The plot was predictable formula. Boring. The interesting thing to happen is a spoiler so I shall not comment on that."
5,Great Customer service,The bottles are beautiful and add a touch of class to the table. The customer service rep. I dealt with was wonderful.My items originally arrived broken and the company was very kind and patient in dealing with my order.
1,Horrible!!!,I work at ups so I wanted to buy sum gloves that would last. And on the first day I used them they ripped. I wouldn't buy these gloves again!!!! Horrible!!!!
2,don't buy,"I have naturally blonde hair and was looking for something to lighten my hair or bring out the natural highlights. There are very few products out there, but this one is nothing special. It's like a normal medium-high end conditioner, and at the price, I think it's exorbitant.In terms of color, I haven't seen any change at all. It does make the hair somewhat soft, but it's not the best soft conditioner. Also, the container itself is a bit awkward to use, as you basically have to plunge your fingers inside the container to get the conditioner out. And it's very runny, so I've spilt probably a good 1/3 of this accidentally while trying to scoop it out."
5,Been there. Done that again,"If you need a sampler of the 1988 alternative radio playlists, you're in the right place.This album helped me survive my internship. ""Been there; done that; what's next"" became that inner mantra getting me through long nights in the hospital. It still gets plenty of airtime on my iPod. People ask if it's Bowie, or somebody else they know, and then are surprised to hear a name they vaguely confuse with a pop schlock artist. In conjunction with ""Everyone Loves the Pilot"", it's maybe the best one-two punch of any artist or group to put out only two albums. I always double check for new stuff, but realize that retirement is retirement unless you're a rock god.Needless to say, both albums are highly rated and highly recommended. They are essential listening for the budding songwriter and the nostalgic 80's survivor."
3,Not Bad,"This debut writer shows a lot of promise and will doubtless improve with a few more novels under her belt. The trials and tribulations of a wedding planner are nicely done, but I found the lead characters to be a little too juvenile and undeveloped for my taste, and the book moves too slowly to really engage the reader's attention.That said, there are some warm and amusing parts to this book, and it's shorter length doesn't require a huge time investment from the reader."
4,"Cute, Simple Reading","This is a cute book, very light reading, predictable, and cheery. There were a few plot inconsistencies, but humourous accounts of some over the top wedding events. Actually, there could have been more of those and less attempt at a plot other than this, and it would be funnier. But entertaining, nonetheless."
4,quick delivery,the purchase to delivery was very quick. The quality of the glass could have been better. The pedestle connection to the plate wasn't as neat as I would have liked.
1,Terrible quality,"This stand is of terrible glass quality. Cloudy glass, has grey tones, and no shine to it at all. Do not order this product."
1,Very Disappointed,Ordered TWO in pink. Both were horribly defective! One arrived with the stem completely broken off of one of the tiers and BOTH of them had extremely slanted plates on two of the tiers. It looked ridiculous! I was very disappointed with the quality and did return them.
1,Awful,They sent me the wrong book! I didnt have time to send it back and get another and so I had to spend twenty additional dollars at my schools bookstore to buy the book and do my homework. This was an awful situation and caused a lot of stress!
5,"Smart, Sexy and Sassy!","This book does a great, funny job of making sense of the world of gay male dating. It's straightforward enough for ANYONE to understand it, and see himself in one of the sometimes-tough-to-admit-but-always-fun personality types. It will change the way you think about yourself--and romance and love. And it will do it in way that makes you laugh and think. Even though I SHOULD have bought them copies, LOL, I showed this book to several friends - and they enjoyed it as much as I did. Don't be as cheap as me! - LOL - makes a great gift!!!"
1,Horrible show!,"Tv is not as entertaining like it use to be and shows like bridezillas are so god damn retarded. I mean seriously women find this so apealing that they watch such spoiled women doing nothing but b i tc hin g and spending to make their wedding so perfect that they don't know what love truly is, they just think it's something out of a fantasy magazine. I mean any kind of cheap wedding would be worthy for true love and not some million dollar wedding for some selfish b i t ch who can't appreciate anything in life.I effing hate this show!"
2,Overkill.....,"I picked this up because I saw snip bits of it on TV, not to mention I want to know what to stay away from when planning my own wedding. Well this DVD was plan boring and at some points just unbelievable. The husbands just sat there like dummies and the things that were so detrimental weren't even that big of a deal. I was looking to see some serious things to be pissed off about during your wedding.Glad I rented it wont even think about going back to get Season 1. I will catch Season 3 on WE if they have one."
4,Good Pencil,"Well, it may be just a pencil, but its a good one. This is the best overall pencil that I have found. The eraser is especially nice; it is large and lasts forever. I use these pencils at my desk and also for field engineering work. The grip is also good."
5,Best Pencil in the World.,"I got this pencil quite awhile ago and have lost it since then. oh well. It was sweet while it lasted. ""*****""."
5,Into the void of chaos,"Recommended for souls that embrace the avant garde theatrical sounds/images/words of the Mighty Celtic Frost. An entertaining read and a great insight on the ""evils"" of the music buisness, the ""relationship"" between Tom and the Press, Tom and his band mates as well as his ""jaded"" outlook on the world...."
4,can't believe this books exists!,"as a long time metal fan (who has always greatly appreciated the very intriguing celtic frost), this book was great reading. given that rock biographies are usually reserved for big time acts, i almost still can't believe that this book exists. what a cool surprise that tom g. got his memoirs published.while the the book is sometimes unintentionally funny when tom pontificates about the magnitude of his vision for frost and his love life, i really loved reading it. it's such a rare glimpse into the very unique world of underground metal that existed in the 80's."
4,"The Warrior, that was me!","Overall a very well done account of Tom G. and Celtic Frost. If you were a fan of the Frosties, this is a must read, it really answered every question I had about this great, forgotten band. Tom takes himself a little seriously at times, but then again he always has. If you aren't a CF fan, you might be somewhat lost, but the tales he tells about the recording industry makes for some good reading. Recommended."
2,Foodies Save Your Money!,"I have this model, and I'm sorry I didn't heed the advice of others. Though it's NOT BAD for the price, it is loud and a bit on the cheap/flimsy side. You can't put anything too hard in it, i.e.; carrots. It's not ment to be used like a medeocre grade food processor. Mine smells like it's going to combust into flames if I try to do too much with it--like shreading too many veggies. It IS cute, and does work well for marinates and sauces, but beyond that, buyer BEWARE, or just fork over dinero for something of a higher grade."
1,Junk.,"This is my second Cuisinart Duet. My first one, a piece of the plastic that locks the processor bowl to the platform broke off after about three uses. I figured I must have done something wrong, so I returned it and bought another one. Same thing happened to the second one. Food Processor still works, but I have to hold on tight to keep it in locked position. It's not great at chopping either, even before it broke. My small $25 chopper works just as well, if not better.The blender portion of it won't even puree frozen strawberries. As another reviewer mentioned, yes it is cute and I love the dual function, but if it's not going to serve its full intended purpose, why buy it? Buy beware!"
2,Was good before it broke,I liked it at first. The short but wide blender is a really nice size. Then one day out of nowhere and for no apparent reason it stopped working. Cuisinart wouldn't help me since it is factory reconditioned. I would buy a brand new version of this because I really do like it but it's not worth buying this particular one.
4,My husband loves it but...,"My husband loves it but I wish the food processor part of this machine were bigger. Its fine for the two of us but if you were to have a family you'd want one that is bigger. It seems to make really good shakes - so my husband says, and it chops things like cabbage and carrots pretty well."
4,CD reissue of singles from 1977 in 1978,"V2 formed in Manchester in 1977.Their distinctive blend of Glam Punk quickly made them a popular live act.They released two single which sold very well.Their first single, released on Bent Records was released in late 1977, and quickly sold out in 3 pressings.Second single, released on TJM Records was released in late 1978 and sold 30,000 in 5 mounths.In this CD there are all great versions of the songs that appeared on their singles and all recordings from 1977 in 1979."
2,NOT MUCH OF A REWARD,"""Red Hat Linux 8 for Dummies"" is one of the few ""for Dummies"" series that included double CD-ROMs. But what a shame! The publisher did not ensure that these CDs are healthy. I had a hard time trying to decode what was in one of them. Also, the pattern of this book is such that some of the basics of 'Red Hat Linux 8' were omitted.Unless you are completely new to the Operating System, there is little reward in purchasing this book. If you are a ""dummy"" who knows one or two things about 'Red Hat', I suggest that you look for something more comprehensive and more accurate. This book may disappoint you. Consider either 'Red Hat Linux 8 Unleashed' or 'Red Hat Linux 8 Bible'. Both texts are simple enough for you to understand. However, they may present too much information for your liking, if you are indeed a beginner."
1,Red Hat Linux 8 for Dummies,"DO NOT BUY this book. All of the software that is suppose to be on the CD is missing. The dos utilities software is missing. If you try to make a boot disk per the instructions, you will find out that your out of luck. Better to buy the Red Hat Personal from Red Hat or somewhere else. It's ashame that the experts can't even be sure that the software is correct when they are touted to be the know it all's. In addition, once you get it loaded you will find the book is of little use. I have Star Office 6.0 which is the the same as the openoffice with the templates. This book doesn't even give you enough information to get you started with openoffice. Do not waste your money on this book"
2,A very very limited introduction,"I am new to Linux and was hoping that this book would help me with the basics and leave me more knowledgeable than I was when I started. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Basics, like installing applications or networking a Linux PC with a Windows PC are entirely left out. On the other hand, the author spends a great deal of time explaining the applets that come with Redhat, even though they are really self explanatory if you've ever used their Windows equivalents. The book makes a very poor reference source, and was virtually no help to me. Perhaps they can leave out the lame humor and include more info in the next version."
3,Good for Fans of Historical Formula 1,"This movie is for race fans. If you aren't a racing fan, specifically an F1 fan, I do not recommend it. If you like historical or contemporary F1, I think you'll enjoy it due to the racing footage.The footage is well done (particularly at Monaco) although the director cuts out from the in car camera at some inexplicable spots from a racing fan perspective (such as right before Eau Rouge!) and they didn't film at the Nordschliefe at all :("
5,Must have for true F1 fans anywhere,This is a classic of days gone by that they will never be able to make a modern movie of the same style. The HD DVD is great and the price is even better. It is wonderfulto see the way it use to be.
5,Great to see this classic in Hi Def!,"I am a big auto racing fan and like the classic racing movies, so this was a no brainer. Everything about the film is classic and the picture and sound quality is top noth for as old as this film is. If you like a bit of cinematic racing history and are a big F1 or Le Mans fan, I highly reccomend Grand Prix in HD."
5,Wonderful Movie.,"I have always wanted to see this movie but never could catch the whole thing. Shots are amazing. Very 60's movie visually. Loved the whole aura. Great story. Great cinematography. The sights and sounds of the glory days of F-1. Life and death. Could never be made now even with CGI. This was real cars, tracks and weather. The extras are worth the price of the DVD. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen."
5,Car Movie Must Haves!!!!,"After waiting 8 yrs for the DVD version it was not disapointing. This is a Car Movie Lover Must Have. You NEED this movie, it belongs with your collection that also should include Bullitt, LeMans, Gone in 60 Seconds and Ronin."
1,Watch out! Outdated format,"It is an ""HD DVD""; i.e. it cannot be played on any normal DVD player, except for some 5 + years old Toshibas. There wasn't any hint to this fact from the seller; thus for me the video is completely useless and I have bad feelings about that seller."
2,"grand prix, a disappointment","the reviews for this movie were exaggerations.the plot was not creative, it seemed to much like a soap opera.Grand Prix should be a 99cent rental!!"
1,Not good,"Couldnt see the movie its was blank , tried in 2 diffrent DVD players plus 1 computer still nothing.Very disapointed"
1,WOULD NOT LOAD,"I ordered new copies of this dvd from two vendors. I have five dvd players, Neither of these dvd's would load on any of the players. When I explained the problem to an electronics store representative, I was told that HD was an old format & would not play on newer dvd players. If true, this should have been explained in the listing. I returned the first one at my expense, which resulted in a refund so little that it wasn't worth the effort. The remaining one, I'll just trash."
1,Not properly described,Buyers need to BEWARE - that you must have a HD DVD Playerin order to watch this HD DVD Film - They no longer produceHD DVD players.
3,classic F1 footage marred by saccharin soap opera,"Director John Frankenheimer fostered a decades-long love for cars.Ronin, released in 1998, book-ends his career. Shortly before his death, he also directed one of the BMW Films shorts starring Clive Owen.Grand Prix combines the soap opera sentimentality of the originalAirportwith the cinema v√©rit√© of Claude Lelouch's infamousC'√©tait un Rendezvous. Yves Montand is top-notch, and James Garner is good, but the female characters are almost universally unlikable. The not-so-romantic storylines weigh down this film, as does the near three-hour-long running time. No matter--the on-location footage of F1 races throughout Europe is the real star.Verdict: stellar racing cinematography, but not a very compelling film.Caught this ON DEMAND, but the 2-discDVDwith lots of special features looks like a deal on sale for ten bucks."
5,grand prix,"great to finally see this film on DVD. typical 60's style cinema. it does do a good job of documenting this great era of auto racing, and is a must for any F-1 fan. the extras are nice, too."
4,Wow!,"This movie was before my time, but after hearing about it from other car guys, I had to get it. As a car movie it's my favorite, but as a movie it's not that great. The cinematography and how they made the movie is spectacular, with some of the best racing scenes in any movie, not just for its time. I would give it 5 stars but some of the off the racetrack scenes are just terrible. I don't know if it's the writing or the acting but, ugh."
4,Quintessential racing movie,"This HD-DVD has great picture quality. I also think it is one of if not the best racing movie ever. The transfer from film to HD is amazing, the cars just POP. I have this already on VHS and DVD. I do not regret adding the HD-DVD version."
5,It will never be surpassed. The best race movie ever.,"This is one of those mysteries in the history of filmaking... However talented John Frankenheimer and the actors involved were / are, how could someone have imagined that a racing car movie made in 1966, I REPEAT, 1966, would still be, in 2007, head and shoulders bette than all the race movies ever made, before or after!!Because ""Grand Prix"" is a master-piece. I will not talk about the amzaing camera angles, the perfect edition, the fact that the actor themselves drive the cars (F3 cars, it's true...), makin a montage with the actual race, the fact that the plot, altough simple, is engaging and makes you cheer for each one of the drivers.No. I'll talk about the ""feel"" of the movie. It flows effortlessly, with class, energy, everything."
5,Not just for the fans!,". . . but if you are a fan of this 1966 classic, arguably the best car racing film ever made, then you *must* see this version. I'm a huge fan - saw it when it came out and have been moderately obsessed with the film since - and I've been muddling along with the VHS for a decade.Now I can see the quality (if not the size) of the original Cinerama film, enjoy the full fidelity of the gorgeous Maurice Jarr√© score, and see two excellent Speedvision documentaries about the film and 60s F1. Along with a promotional film from the period about the making of. Interviews, then and now, with Frankenheimer and some of the stars (Jimmy G. isn't lookin' too great these days!) The insights into Frankenheimer and his method are fantastic.If you've never seen the film, don't expect much of a story, but the in-car racing footage has never been equalled in a feature film. That combined with the music and sound make for a very rewarding experience."
5,"Excellent racing action film, and extra content is interesting too.",Extras include how film was made of about 20 minutes and also separate documentary of F1 in that time period (also 20+\- minutes). Film has intermission part was through.
4,"Zoom, Zoom!","Great movie, lots of action, made by people who knew what they were doing, with experienced actors and real drivers, just about as close to the real thing as you can get!Get it!"
4,good racing from the old days,lots of nostalgia.great shots of tracks no longer used. plot was too mushy. cars were great. photography was good for the time it was shot.
5,Well Done Restoration!,"Always one of my favorite movies, I'm very pleased with the job they did in finally bringing this to DVD. The 'extras' are worth while too. I went to my first Grand Prix in 1969 and this movie certainly brought F1 to life before I saw it live. I've seen 2 GPs at Brands Hatch in the '70s and while the short is excellent, it doesn't capture that excitement of your first hearing the engines. Yes, you really used to be able to get that close to the cars. And Monaco is still 'the' race of the year.Hope you enjoy the movie!"
4,"Intense, dynamic and realistic Formula racing drama!","Grand Prix is my absolute all-time favorite film. The world of classic motorsports is presented through following the campaign of an American driver stoicly played by James Garner who is quite believable in the role. While the story has its subplots to add more human interest, they tend to slow things down to a greater degree then they enhance the viewer's appreciation of the film. Dialogue is sometimes stilted and Eva Marie Saint brings pure vanilla to her part. One must think that a more passionate actress could have vastly improved on her role.The racing footage is AWESOME however, with great first person perspectives. All the sights, sounds, and sensations of trips around the track on skinny tires at breakneck speed are there. For anyone who enjoys cars, racing, or James Garner's work, this is a must see. For people to whom racing has ever MEANT something, Grand Prix is a must have!"
2,Racing great- movie boring!!,"Short and simple. The scenes of the race cars are FANTASTIC! The story is long and boring. Come on, 3 hours!"
5,One of racings best movies!,I love racing and this was always one of my favorite movies on the topic. James Garner is great in the lead role as a has-been driver who comes back to the top. The racing scenes are spectacular and the love stories are poignant and very realistic.
4,Beware: Pan and Scan,"Be aware that this is a Pan and Scan version of the film, a fact that is omitted in the product description. As a result, many scenes that were thrilling in Cinemascope and awkward here. Nonetheless, I fully concur with other reviewers - this is a must have film for car buffs and racing fans."
4,and i SWEAR i didnt watch it for the body count!,"this is a fascinating peek into a time that was ending just as the movie was made. im not a fan of auto racing, ive never been able to understand the appeal or the strategy involved, but after watching this film (and the terrific supplementary documentaries found on disc 2 of the dvd) i can appreciate better the love some feel for the sport. as a movie, its your run of the mill soaper, featuring good performances by the always reliable james garner, yves montand, &c. -- but nobody who watches this movie is watching it for plot or character nuances. and oh how i wish i had seen this 40 years back on a big screen!"
5,It's The Passion Stupid,"If you are new to motorsports, and don't own this movie, buy it now or at least put it on your wish list. If you're a long time enthusiast but don't own this movie, what's wrong with you?The cars and circuits may be dated but not since Grand Prix has there been an equivalent racing movie - not LeMans, not Winning, not Driven and certainly not Days Of Thunder. I am convinced that John Frankenheimer (French Connection, Ronin) is the ONLY director that can shoot racing/chase scenes properly. His passion for film making AND the sport oozes from this work.I suggest the wide screen version so nothing is missed."
4,excellent racing scenes,"I purchased this movie after learning about it from the director's (i.e. John Frankenheimer's) commentary from the ""Ronin"" DVD. ""Ronin"" features great car chase scenes and I hoped that this movie devoted to 1960's F1 racing also by Frankenheimer would be great too. And it is, which is why I recommend the film.Some of the scenes are a bit dated, and one racing sequence with corny orchestral waltz music playing was frankly awful, but there is more to like than not, and by the time the action of the film arrives at the Monza race track, you'll forgive the bad parts.The only I reason not to buy the wide-screen VHS is to hold out for the DVD."
2,Don't buy the HD-DVD,"Don't buy the HD-DVD version. It has been butchered into a 1.66:1 format, making a nonsense of the multi-image sequences, and the director's original panoramic vision. The standard, and cheaper, 2 disc edition looks exceptionally good on an HD-DVD player and presents the film in more or less the full, original Ultra-Panavison ratio."
3,"Historical in movie making, but still too stiff for me.",I enjoyed the extra features more than the actual movie. The filming of the racing scenes and events was worth the over acting and mediocre plot.
1,why,"why is this movie rated so well? its slow, has limited plot, the special effects are extremely dated and annoying and its not even exciting to watch the racing scenes..."
1,"I assume this is the ""free"" ""watch it now""","I really rate it 0 (zero). You will not let me watch it because I do not happen to be connected to a server in the US. What difference does it make whether I am connected to a server in Quito, Sidney, Bankok, or New York when I want to watch it. It may be a free addition to a purchase - but the whole idea still stinks."
3,"It's cheap, and it shows.","It's a cheap trimmer, if you expect it to only last a couple of seasons before you get fed up with it and want to replace it with a better model, then by all means, go for it. Second season in my pull start line broke. This isn't covered under warranty, and it took me a little more than 3 hours to replace it. A real pain in the butt.I'm not really happy with the power either, it seems to bog down a lot. I hope to get 1 more season use out of it before I start looking for a replacement.Oh, and by season, I do mean about 4-5 uses a year. Yeah, that's how fast the line broke on it."
1,troybilt TB70SS,"I bought the TB70ss 3 years ago. Have had nothing but trouble since. I use it about 1/2 hour every time I mow the yard.Only way it would run is half choke. Took it to shop and they said it needed a kit in carb. Ran so, so for a while then started doing same thing. Took it back and they said it need kit again. They put kit in and still ran terrible. The bump head didnt last 1 year. Now the starter is not winding up as it should. I will never buy another troy bilt product."
2,Much better options!!,"I purchased this model from Lowes last season thinking it was better than some other options they sold. In a nut shell I intended to buy a semi-commercial string trimmer and seddled for this model and totally regret it. The posts about the bump head are true...piece of garbage, I also have had trouble with the way it ran, it never has ran without being on partial choke and now is running really bad. Gonna have to do some serious work on a fairly new machine...DO YOURSELF A FAVOR! SPEND A BIT MORE UP FRONT FOR A HUSKY,ECHO,STIHL,SHINDAWA...I wish I had. Troy bilt used to be a respectable machine, but appears they sold out."
1,Hurricane Mis-stake,"This product is a piece of junk. While hammering it into the ground, which was soft following a night of rain, the black cap instantly shattered into multiple pieces, nearly hitting me in the face. After continued hammering the top of the stake flew off.I contuned to hammer the stake into the ground only to watch it peel back completely down to the screws holding in the chain. At this point, one good pull by my 150 pound Great Dane(or even my 12 pound Pug)and the chain would have lifted right out. I now have to figure out how to dig it out of the ground and throw it in the trash. This is a complete waste of money."
3,Cake Plate,"I was a little disappointed with this purchase. The lid does not fit flush on the plate. And the ""scalloped"" edge is not done very well...my plate looks like the glass was cut in a circle without following the scalloping on the edge. I geuss it's okay, but not as pretty as the picture depicts. It's okay for the price I paid."
5,yummy poison,"Lorelei Shannon is one of horror's more interesting writers. Her stuff ranges from sweetly dark to grisly to chilling, but it's always unforgettable. She gets published a lot in the markets for short horror fiction; unfortunately, these are sometimes hard to get, so it's wonderful (if scary!) to have a lot of Lorelei Shannon stories all in one book.Drink deep --- this is the best kind of horror."
3,Only give it three stars cause of the Gillie Da Kid Track,The rest of the cd is just ok. But I still many years later pull out Something to bounce to. I have friends who know hip hop ask me who the song is and I end up sending them a copy of the song. Fire.
2,not off the chain,"I was very disappointed with this cd. I am a long-time Suave House fan. I still bump Coming Out Hard and Tela's Piece of Mind. Suave House seems to have gotten lazy and or not motivated to put out quality music. The only high points on this cd are Eightball's solo song and PhsychoDrama. If you in the Chi-town area or if your local mom and pop can get it, pick up PsychoDrama's Greatest hits. You can hear the talent that this group has. They are the tightest group out of the Chi you've barely heard off. Tony Draper what are you doing???? Hickman is lyrically nice too. I'm keeping this cd till I can burn a few songs then off to the used cd spot it goes."
5,Marine table,OK I used this table for 1 season now the table worked great in my pontoon only wish the cup holders were deeper.
5,Best book I have ever read!,This book can be used for learning or completely as entertainment! It's well written teaches some of the ideas behind Ericksonian Hypnosis and I laughed at so many of the stories. It was easy and quick to read and most importantly entertaining!
3,"Good Book, but over Haley's head","As an admirer of Milton H Erickson's work and techniques, I wish I could give this book (which i happen to own) a better score. Contained within is alot of great and useful information, unfortuneatly the novice will learn very little from the book on how the therapy is performed. The persons familiar with Ericksons work will find it a good source for condensed case histories, and fresh ideas, even when Haley does not fully understand the nature of what he is writing about, he does a good job of keeping things flowing and drawing simple conclusions.Overall - 3 for most ppl, 4 for the erickson fan."
4,The Dwelling Place - Kindle item,"This is a great sequel to The Swan House - which you should read first. However, I would like to compare the print version with my Kindle version that I downloaded. The Kindle version is very sloppily typed/edited. Many of the sentences run together with no punctuation - extremely annoying. These run-together sentences are found throughout the Kindle edition. I also found that some of these sentences wouldn't make sense if you added punctuation. Most of the book is well written and edited, with the exception of these many sloppy parts. Not sure what happened, Kindle??"
2,Not as good as Swan House,"I must say that I was disappointed in this novel. I loved Swan House, so when Elizabeth Musser's, Dwelling Place was published, I immediately bought it. It was a little too religious for me. The main character of the book called her parent's religious talk, ""babble', and I felt like the religious parts in this book were also ""babble"". It dragged in the middle but grew a bit more interesting toward the end. I also could not get into Musser's writing about France in the late 1960's. Although I was too young to experience the Civil Rights issues during the 1960's in the South and more specifically, Atlanta, I could still relate to those stories in Swan House. I know I am being candid, but if you loved Swan House, Dwelling Place will disappoint you."
2,The Dwelling Place (The Swan House Series #2),"This is story is Boring. While the pros and writing style are par excellence, this is not top shelf for me."
1,Problem Connection,"I made the mistake of using two of these connectors; one at the wall mount for the AV receiver and one at the wall mount for the LED TV. While installation was easy, there was so much signal loss that between the three cables (AVR to wall, inside wall, wall to TV) the TV could not pick up the signal. I tried about four different kinds of cables, and found only one manufacturer's three foot cable that would transmit signal to the TV. If I inserted an L connector, that was enough interference to destroy the signal. I assumed my problem was the AVR or the wall cable which was a Monster M1000. After I read the first review here, I removed the cables to go connectors, and replaced them with simple pass throughs. It completely solved the problem. Now all cables work regardless of length (including an 8 foot monster cable). Unfortunately, it took me too long to figure out the problem to return these connectors. I would never use them again or ever recommend them to anyone."
4,A Must for Titanic Fans...,"Very interesting to read the scenes that were written for the movie, but not actually included. Got for my daughter, but I just couldn't help but take a peek....worth the peeking!"
5,This book makes it clear why the movie is so extraordinary!,"This book is absolutely fantastic! It is beautifully put together, especially with the pictures in it, many which I have not seen before. The most interesting thing about this book is the fact that it also includes the scenes that were deleted from the movie. I recommend this book to any Titanic fan and to people who are in love with the movie, like me. I am 20 years old and I have seen the movie three times in the cinema, and also got the video from amazon.com, and watched it several times already. You just have to buy this book!"
3,"Titanic's screenplay, the only Oscar the film didn't win !!!","Everyone says Titanic isn't a good movie. I won't deny that it is an entertaining, very good film. However, it's strength doesn't lie in it's screenplay and I would only recommend it to very strong fans of the movie. Cameron has obviously gone overboard with the effects and forget that story makes all the difference. Want to read a truly great screenplay from 1997: try Good Will Hunting or L.A. Confidential . . ."
5,The REAL Titanic,"This book far exceeded my expectations! A must buy for ANY Titanic enthusiast. The pictures inside are extroadinary-they include lost scenes from the gymnasium and ones including Mr and Mrs Strauss. I kept on wondering why some powerful scenes were cut from the final film as I read, but you can decide for yourself. The lost scenes also explain a helluva lot. Also it contains the REAL ending that was cut for budget purposes...."
5,Contains excellent reference materials and photos!,"""Titanic: James Cameron's Illustrated Screenplay"" captures all the nuances of the script that made such a popular movie, while including notes by Randall Flakes as to what was deleted, what was edited, and even what lines were spoken differently. The script is a fascinating read all by itself, but what makes this book so interesting are the vast array of color photographs and images that permeate the pages, giving us a glimpse of each scene is beautiful color. With this wonderful tome, it's easy to see why the movie gained so much popularity, and this is a book that will be treasured for many generations to come."
3,it was good but...........,"everything about the DVD was great awesome performence by faithless but according to amazon this DVD is all region, but really it isn't. this DVD cannot be played on region 1 DVD players it can only be played by Region 2-6 Players or Region Free Players. so do not buy this DVD if you don't have a REGION FREE PLAYER."
5,Wow!,"Open your mind and experience this masterpiece. Sister Bliss is amazing, the PRIEST is a riot, and the concert ROCK me to the bones.Layer Electronic music may not be big in this country, but this concert could shape favorable opinion. In view of today's inferior rock, and these musicians put all of 'Em in shame"
2,Don't Waste Your Time - BEWARE,"I don't care how good these chocolates are, I ordered on April 18 2008. Emailed them finally because they hadn't been shipped. Never got a response to me email. They finally shipped them FedEx Ground on the 28th of April, 10 days later at a charge of $10 for shipping. Now they will certainly be melted by the time they arrive.Look, I also ordered Leonidas Belgian Chocolates and Godiva, because I wanted to try some various kinds. Godiva still hasn't shiped but I highly recommend Leonidas Belgian. I got them in one day and they responded to an email in the same day. They arrived in excellet condition and were so good that I ordered three more.BEWARE and look at seller profile and feedback."
3,"Torn between a great show, and the terrible corporate entity","Paramount deserves to have their DVDs boycotted for making purchasers of the 4th season of ""Fraiser"" sit through ads for 3 OTHER series sets before getting to what I paid to view. The trick, I found, is using the chapter skip buttons on my remote. The buttons for Menu, Title, Fast Forward, and Pause all DO NOTHING! The way this DVD is constructed should be cause for a class action against Paramount!"
2,Delay in shipping,It takes awfully long for the shipment...it says 3-5 days...but I ordered it on a friday and did not receive it even until the following friday. It was pointless purchase since I intended to have it before I left out of town.Maybe this was an exception case but it just didn't work for me...
5,best season,"season 4 the best in the series, the clive lies is my favorite episode, thats why i bought the dvd..."
5,Frasier Contnues To Rock!,Frasier is such a loveable character and each season got even better then the previous one(s).
5,4th times a charm,"Season 4 is funny right in the beginning with niles and his muffin, that is not the episode name but if you buy this you will know, it goes from dad meeting sherry, lilith and frasier getting freddy in school, while freddy is getting beat up, by someone you wouldnt think, down to daphne hating sherry and much more."
5,Great quality mechanical pencils,All 3 of my young adult children were so excited to receive these pencils in their Christmas stockings! They are hard to find in local stores and they will use them till they are completely worn out again!
5,These are perfect,"A good eraser, easy graphite loading, 0.7mm is a good all around size. I bought a bunch of them to have in all the places I usually wind up writing something."
5,Great design!,"I use these all day, five+ days a week. It's a well made mechanical pencil. Dependable, easy to refill, and comfortable to use.The only flaw I can think of is that you can't refill the eraser (AFAIK.) I tend to use a separate eraser anyway, so that's not that big of a deal to me. But these things are constructed so well that they'll definitely outlive their eraser many times over."
3,"Some classics, some duds","I purchased this for my 3 and 5 year old kids because I thought they would like Where the Wild Things Are. They did enjoy it and then I was surprised by the second show In the Kitchen. It had a naked little boy used for the story. Not something I would recommend for my children to watch much. Plus one of the shows features a little boy Pier singing a song about saying, ""I don't care"". Not something I'm trying to teach my young children. Overall, not my favorite Scholastic DVD collection, but if you love Where the Wild Things Are, you'll still want to own it."
5,Delightful and Classic,"My toddler loves the video animation of his favorite books. He loves the singing and music, which surprised me. The dvd has encouraged him to read his books more often because the dvd is true to the books. Definitely, a thumbs up."
5,One of the best kids' videos ever (ages 3-5),"It's always hard as a parent to find a video that kids and parents both like. Most people are familiar with Where the Wild Things Are, but following it are numerous short stories set to music written by Carole King that make this video special. I highly suggest also purchasing the small set of four books, the Nutshell Library (illustrated by Maurice Sendak) that King put to music. That way you can ""sing"" the books with your kids at night or on the road. Some are educational, others are just fun, but they are very entertaining, and not annoying even after hearing multiple times. Thanks, Carole King for giving us a respite from Barney and company!"
1,shockingly inappropriate,"I am a first grade teacher. We had 20 minutes before recess and we had just finished an assessment for friendly letters. So I put in this DVD for the students to watch. During the second story, ""In the Night Kitchen"", the students were giggling. I was busy cleaning up and I wasn't really watching. A few minutes into the story I look up and I notice that the little boy in the story is naked, and his little cartoon penis and balls are flopping around with him. I am very upset about this! Yikes! I didn't know that I needed to preview a Maurice Sendak video. This is not in the picture book."
1,Worst purchase ever!,"The main story was fine, just the book being read, but the 5 other stories were horrible! Naked little boy playing in dough and stories that don't make sense and kids don't care about! Don't buy! Just read the book to your kid yourself!"
3,"Fun little guide in some areas, needs more info in others","I bought this guide in hopes of learning a lot of background information about each episode. I was disappointed in what I found although it can be useful and interesting.Covering the first two seasons the guide gives each episode a single B/W photo, a guest cast list, the writer and director (and sometimes who did the teleplay). This is followed by a quote from one of the characters in each episode, a one paragraph synopsis and a paragraph or two about the episode by a cast member or someone behind the scenes. A gray box with information about a character or race in some episodes.The forward, the character profiles at the books end, and a couple of other short sections on episode production actually gave the most information. It seems obvious to me that the cast seem to like each other and generally enjoy doing the show, I just wish I'd gotten more information about how it's all done."
2,Buy the DVDs instead,"If you can't afford the DVD sets then this is a decent little guide. A bit of an expansion on just seeing the episodes, but not in depth. If however you can swing the DVDs they have all the background on the episodes and much much more. Believe me if you buy the set you will be so happy watching them again with an exceptional clear picture and sound and commercial free. Then when you start looking at all the extras on the DVDs you will realize it is money well spent."
2,Not very illustrated,"I was pretty disappointed to see that in an ""illustrated"" companion, the best they could do was one image per episode, and black and white no less. The pictures are fair, and sometimes grainy. No color, no sharp detail. Some look like the were scanned in using a low quality scanner.The text is interesting at times, but if you're buying this to look at all the pictures, don't bother."
4,The Commander Was Actually Quite,"Yes I thought The Commander was quite good. I was on the edge of my seat watching the series. What kept me on the edge of my seat wasn't about the plot or who done it, so much as who The Commander was going to jump in the sack with next. Every time she interviewed a good looking guy it seemed like something could potentially happen. Even with that in mind I found the series really good. If you haven't watched it, give it a go."
3,"Great series, bad last season","I was disappointed with the last episode, not to mention that it was a weak way to end a good series. The whole baby- kidnapping line of plot was transparent and overdone. Blech. Nor was the part about Brian and the murder of his mother any good. It was obvious who had killed her, and all of us knew it wasn't Brian. This series should have stopped at Season 4."
3,Adequate,"This cover does an adequate job of protecting the body of the Treo. It is not particularly attractive, nor does it protect the screen, but what more can one expect for this price?"
3,"An informative, thought-provoking documentary","Angst was released in 2009. It is a Dutch-made documentary, with narration, that chronicles the case studies of six different people who live in the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. These six individuals--four females/two males--deal with varying challenges. One of them--a woman by the first name of Dieuwke--was taking showers for so long that she was developing a skin problem. I do wish that one of the case studies that dealt with another woman could have gone into more detail, though. Regardless, Angst is an interesting, instructive look into what these six people contend with, and I have watched this documentary several times. The film is eighty-seven minutes and is in Dutch with English subtitles. I consider Angst to be a recommendable film."
4,Good but for children,"I read this book a few years ago. I think it was a good book, but about a third grade reading level. So if you have a mid elamentary child that likes archery or midevil times I would recomend it. If your thirty years old you are prabaly going to want a more detailed book."
4,Not quite true daylight,"The light is close to true color but a bit too yellow, I should have ordered the 4700K. High quality bulb, made in Japan, would buy again."
5,Finding the Perfect Gift,"If you are sometimes stumped for gift ideas, this book comes in handy. It lists occasions (housewarming, retirement, christening, hospitalization, etc.) and suggests suitable gifts. For instance for ""retirement"" it recommends a Mexican rope hammock, a gift certificate to a health club, a gold-tooled photo album, and other gifts. Along with the list, the book gives some guidelines for each category and things to be sensitive to in your giving.For major gift giving occasions (Christmas, birthdays) it breaks the suggestions down into age groupings plus man/woman, and even suggests ""stocking stuffers."" For wedding anniversaries, it lists the traditional list and a revised list.Part II of the book gives tips for giving money, gift certificates, donations to a charity in the person's name, group presents, and even eliminating someone from your gift list.The book is slim, but easy to consult so hopefully your gift giving is more ""on target"" in the future."
5,Very very good book,"Libby Lazewnik is a really good auther. I have read a lot of her books. The Lemonade Lesson is a book filled with remarkable and really good short stories. They are filled with alot of lessons, and things to think about. It was a great book!"
1,Very disappointing!!!,"This is the first time I have been truly disappointed in something I have gotten through Amazon, much smaller than it looks in picture, if it was five dollars it would be too much, too late now to do anything for Christmas,just not worth it at all............."
1,Still edited...,"... If you're looking for ""100% Pure Manga"" as the CMX blurb breathlessly reads.. then this book is not it. It is incredibly edited down from its original state.. so much so that it becomes difficult to understand character motivations, behaviour and dialogue.Do not buy, not even as a gift. Really bad."
1,Are you kidding?,"I will agree that the sound quality on this CD is outstanding (especially compared to most compilations of vocal artists). The songs, however, are gruesome renditions of classic material that are no better than the average swill pitched on late night TV. If you love Jim Nabors and Anne Murray, knock yourself out, but I thought Damone was better than this."
4,More Magnification!,"After recieving myOrion SkyQuest XT8 Classic Dobsonian Telescopeand trying it I just KNEW I needed more magnification, so after some looking this was the highest I could find with out barlow. It arrived quite quickly and using it was great, it was definitively better then my 25mm on planets, the two red bands across Jupiter are easily seen, my only complaint is this eyepiece is slightly un-clear on deep space objects, all in all a good eyepiece for planetary observations."
3,ok for smaller plug boots,"The on-line picture is decieving. It's only 4"" long and the wire grip is abut as big as an average persons thumb when clamped together (about 3/4""). Yes, I beleive such a tool has to be small to fit in tight spots but I have a Tahoe and it won't go around the wire/boot. It appears to me to be more suited for small engines (mower, 2-cycle, etc.) and small engine cars where the boot is smaller. It's a good design, it's a good idea, but it doesn't seem to work for larger applications - good for the smaller stuff."
3,Where are the popular ones?,whatever happened to Its not unusual? There are quite a few of the more popular songs missing in this collectors edition. Do not be misled by the the title.
1,Didn't last very long,"The fake leather started peeling off after just a month. I have had many of those, and the quality has gotten worse and worse..."
3,Average Shoe - Good price,I agree with the shoestring issue everyone mentions. They are also difficult to get tight which is critical for me since I have a narrow foot. As a result the shoes slips more than it should and I don't beleive I could correct with a smaller size because they would not fit. The heel comes up high on the foot which mostly just makes it noticeable. It doesn't cause a problem but I don't like to wear shoes that make me think about the shoe.I also think they rather heavy. All said for the price they are acceptable. I don't walk much at work so they are okay but if I did I don't think I would keep the shoes even for the price.
3,"Nice product, slow delivery and follow-up","Finally received the shoes after 6 weeks. Good quality, just VERY slow. This included several e-mails and phone calls about the order. The product wasn't backordered, they just forgot. Good thing I wasn't in a hurry. I received a $10 (sorry for the mistake) voucher on a future order, but not sure that I would trust them again considering the availability of other shoe vendors."
5,Great intro to 2D design,"When I was in art school, our teacher used examples from this book to help us understand and explore 2D design. I just bought it recently to refresh my knowledge of the basic elements of design and to find a new direction for my printmaking. This tiny book is a great guide. Use is to help you explore all the possibilities that 2D design can offer you as an artist. You need to grow with this book. The book will not tell you what and how to do it."
5,Great Book,Being new to the design world I needed a book that was simple and not encumbered with a bunch of mumbo jumbo. This book is easy to understand and perfect it really helped me to understand 2D Design. I really love this book!
4,It's not the first listen...,"This is one album that sure gets under your skin. I bought it because of all the good things I'd heard, but on the first listen, I wasn't that impressed. Sure it had a decent sound, but the songs don't have hooks, so to speak, so it didn't grab me.That said, I put it on again for another listen. This time it was for the long drive home through traffic on a beautiful afternoon, and what a difference! Suddenly the tunes flowed together perfectly, and it was just like I was at the coolest party in town. I can definitely see why folks who are Marah fans love them live.Sure it sounds like Springsteen and the Pogues put together. What a mix!"
5,Faraway You!,"I cannot stop listening to possibly the most joyous opening cut on a rock and roll album in decades. Faraway You has some Boss, some Stones, some Mats, but in the end it's Marah, and it's exhilarating.I also love the breathless move to Point Breeze, a great party record.Round Eye Blues is pretty powerful, a song Phil Spector may have produced after watching ApocNow.Philadelphia: Rocky Balboa, the '82-'83 76ers, Live Aid, the '93 Phillies, and Marah."
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"After hearing all the hype about Marah, I was really disappointed when I heard this disk. I love Tom Waits, Springsteen, etc, and I love ""rockin"" bands, but this garage band sounds awful! The songwriting and performances are pretentious, sophmoric, gimmicky, and very, very dull. (the lead singer sounds like Randy Newman with the flu?)"
1,This band doesn't know how to rock!,"This CD was VERY disappointing. It's just bad. No musicality, boring clich√©d lyrics, no passion. The vocals sound almost highschool-ish. One thought kept going through my head as I listened to it - ""Yet Another CorporateRock Experiment"". I.e. it's obvious to me, when you finally give into the hype and listen to Marah, that they are just another corporate country/rock formula band - just another insipid ""revival"" band, playing lackluster country-rock to appease middle-aged babyboomers who are afraid to finally let go of old, tired music.Sure, if Marah was actually a good band, this revivalism would be excusable, even enjoyable. We all love the classic rockers - Springsteen, etc. But man, if you're gonna rip off a musical style, AT LEAST BE GOOD AT IT."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Frank Zappa once said that pop music's saving grace is its audience's lousy memory; people will think something is new because they forgot the artists who did the same thing in the past. No one has forgotten Springsteen, however, and because Marah sound so much like his early albums, it's hard not to compare. The sound is there (the singer could be a stand in for the Boss), and on the first few listens, I thought I'd really found something. But the songs aren't good enough to sink in. There are some interesting lyrics, but a bunch of lousy ones, too. Maybe a good band will be inspired by this E-Street banjo sound and take it to the next level. Maybe Marah will mature a bit and take it there themselves. If you've got the cash, check it out, if you're scraping the bottom of your piggy bank, think twice."
2,Why the hype about this CD?,"I read numerous reviews about these guys, from semi-well-respected publications (at least in my book). After listening, I'm left wondering...what is all the hype about? Can't reviewers find any better albums to talk about? Musically, they aren't bad to listen to, but there isn't anything on this album we haven't heard before. For many of us dying to find the next, great new band to listen to, and to inspire us, this isn't the one."
3,"Not the Boss, But Not Bad","I bought this CD on the strength of a review that compared it to Springsteen's ""The Wild, the Innocent & the E St. Shuffle."" Umm, not quite. The only real similarities are the rough-edge vocals and the urban landscape. But where Springsteen can capture the joy and dangers of the street, these songs are overcrowded with characters who ""put a bullet in her brain"" and ""finger your trigger and welcome death."" The lyrics are pretty sophomoric. Still, their sound is good, and there's potential here. Give 'em a few albums to find the right style."
4,Believe the hype -- Marah is for real,"The comparisons to Springsteen, Stones and Replacements are apt, but this disc brings Dylan and the Pogues (Shane MacGowan Era) to my mind. Marah has the same flood of imagery and the same manic energy that Dylan and the Pogues had. I am not saying Marah is as good as Dylan and/or the Pogues. One disc does not a career make. I will keep my eye on these guys though. A string of discs as good as ""Kids in Philly"" and those comparisons will not be so ludicrous sounding."
3,Average,I bought this album after seeing them in concert at Bonnaroo 2006. Their live performance was much better than the album.
2,Some bad information,"I bought this book hoping to get a good understanding of animation fundamentals. However, after getting into an actual studio and starting production I found many of the topics that were discussed are incorrect. He does a good job of skimming the surface of animation, but falls short on actually teaching hard core animation skills."
1,Low Grade Info,"If you really want to learn character animation, look into Inspired 3D Character Animation. I obtained an advanced copy of this book and it is the ONLY book out there written by an ACTUAL INDUSTRY PROFESSIONAL who has an impressive film credit list including ILM and Imageworks. It also includes interviews and insights into the craft from some of todays top animation talent. Big focus on animation fundamentals and how to apply them to your work. Ignoring these fundamentals is probably the biggest mistake new animators who want to break into the business make and the reason for the countless number of demo reels that get a toss in the rejection bin and a form letter.Your choice but if I were trying to learn animation I would want to learn the secrets of the people actually doing it at the highest levels in today's industry. This book will pay back the money with your first gig."
4,Pretty good i liked it,"I think that this book was worth the money. It gave a good look on how to become the character, act the character and more. It didn't really tell you how to make the characters but that is in the first book. I would definetly buy these two books at the same time."
4,Excellent!,"Great for chocolate connoissuers, but not for chocoholics. Very limited supplies, so order when you can!"
4,Very good chocolate,"This is chocolate at its finest. Its definitely an acquired taste as its a lot more bitter than milk chocolate. However, pull this out with friends over and you'll amaze them with its unique, rich taste. Storing in the freezer I found also greatly extends the chocolate's life while keeping the taste fresh."
5,Balanced View On Emerging Church Structures,"Larry Kreider has done a great job of introducing us to a ""new"" type of church that is emerging. This is not a reactionary book full of bitterness or pride, unlike much of the house church material out there."
3,A good balanced approach,"Sometimes when you read authors favoring house churches you almost detect a ""this is the only way to do church"" mentality. Kreider writes with balance and acknowledges the need for all types of churches ranging from the house church to larger congregational churches. It was a great read as he wove his own story into the principles he was sharing on house churches."
2,Author Misses the Point,"Kreider seems to have much experience. However he completely misses the reality that the emerging church in its missional, house church, network forms is actually a prophetic critique. All means are not justified by the end in the Kingdom of God.The emerging church in its truest sense is NOT JUST ANOTHER CONSUMER option for the younger generation. Every generation has ""changed the wall paper in the church buildings."" This is a fundamental shift that is taking place which is moving away from the REDUCED GOSPEL, LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF SALVATION AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD, and fundamentally reforming what it means to be the people of God, the church. The reformers said the church is always reforming. And that meant that some of the current structures (e.g. Catholic pennance structures) could actually be anti-Christ. Like Jesus said to those religious leaders who actually kept people from entering the door of the Kingdom of God!"
2,Loves but it leaks,I have had these shakers for 7 years and I love the simple and elegant look of the shakers. Unfortunately I am looking for a new set because the salt one has been leaking salt everywhere the last year.
2,Not as described,"The Trudeau salt/pepper shaker set is advertised as ""metal"". They are NOT. They are plastic. Albeit they are still an attractive set, I would not have bought them if I had known otherwise.Typically, I read reviews before purchasing. However, I didn't think I needed to this time for such an insignificant purchase. Learned my lesson. It's always ""Buyer Beware""."
2,"Nice style, but salt shaker leaks","I'm giving these 2 stars just for the style and price, but, like the other say, the salt shaker leaks out the bottom. Looking for a replacement..."
1,Leaky,"Salt leaks all over the place!!! I've had these for years and they've always leaked no matter how hard you screw it in. Every time I move the shakers from the table to the cabinet or somewhere else, there's a puddle of salt where they were sitting before.Finally fed up and I'm on AMazon to replace them when, lo and behold, I see these things are still on sale! Stay away."
1,Trudeau S & P said metal turned out to be plastic!!!,"Trudeau Red Salt & Pepper shakers said they were ""4-1/2"" metal"" and turned out they were plastic. If I had known they were plastic, I would have ordered another brand. They were a gift...I nwas sorry that they were not what she wanted, but I don't have possesion of them so I can't return them. They are still being advertised as metal."
1,Plastic,"We have not used these yet but gave it only one star due to it is not what is advertised. These shakers are made of plastic, not metal as described in the listing. Amazon needs to reword the listing."
2,salt and pepper shakers,"I wanted red salt and pepper shakers to accent my neutral kitchen. I thought these were really cute. I ordered yesterday and they came today. They are really cute but when I took them out of the box the whole bottom fell out. I'll have to reglue it. Also , the box says they are metal and your description says metal, but they are definitely plastic. I'm a little disappointed but I will keep them."
1,Red Trudeau Shakers,We were disappointed with this product. There was no bottom stopper for the pepper shaker (a cotton ball stuffed into the hole does not work!). They are not the same red color. One is more a maroon and the other is more orange red.
2,Flimsy and cheap feeling...,"Flimsy and cheap feeling due to their lack of weight, but they look exactly like this. Possibly overpriced as well."
1,Troy-Bilt TB25BP Gas Blower,"The blower worked one time. We replaced the spark plug, had new gas/oil and gas can. Called the company and was told it might be the coil? The next nightmare was finding a place to have it fixed since only one of the five places they suggested would in fact take it. It remains in the repair shop and of course if it is 'carburator' related it will not be covered under warranty, per the repair shop. I will never buy another Troy Bilt product or anything mechanical on line again. Probably will never blow leaves by the looks of the repair time!"
5,purchase order receipt,"I NEVER RECIEVED A PAID BILLING STATEMENT, I CALLED WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED MY BLOWER AND WAS TOLD I WOULD RECIEVE ONE. I KNOW I WILL NEED ONE FOR WARRENTY REPAIR. PLEASE SEND ONE. THE BLOWER IS GREAT, GREAT,GREAT. THANKS FBJR"
4,"Lightweight, Gas Powered Blower","It is a step up from an electric unit, and no cord.This unit is not as heavy as other units, and also not as powerful, and then again not as expensive.The fall will be the real test with leaves."
1,Shield is Black and Scuffed,"I received this shield in the mail and it was not smoked. It was Black. I have matched the numbers and I have held a flashlight up to the shield. There are no discrepancies in the numbers and the light does not penetrate the shield. I cannot even justify calling the shield smoke even based on the color. However it is built pretty sturdy. Unfortuantly there are multiple scuff marks on the shield do to a lack of protection. Last time I bought one of these it had cellophane stuck to the visible edge to prevent scuffing during shipping. Don't know if it was the maufacturer or Amazon, although Amazon is usually pretty good about packaging their shipments, it arrived in the manufacturer's carton."
5,WOW,"I really can't remember how I came about this band. Maybe it was fate. But I'm glad I did. I'm kind of mad that they would compare this band to Green Day, these guys are so much more advanced than the power chords and major scales of Billy Joe. This cd finds its way back into my cd player every day at least, its just that good. The guitars are awesome, the drums are fast and loud, and the singer is someone even I can sing along with. Buy this cd if you are a fan of melodic punk rock at its best."
2,Hazard,"The set is nice to look at and probably fun to use, but I probably won't ever use it. Who want's thin glass at a party where people may (will probably) get drunk? The glass of the container is really thin. At first I thought, oh well, I can just use the container as a vase (it is a nice shape for one) but the glass is so thin at the top I don't really want to mess with it sober either.If you are clumsy (like most drunk people) don't buy thi. It is a blood letting waiting to happen. However, the Vodka glasses do seem sturdy enough though, and if the price stays at [$$$] the set is worth it for that."
2,"Interesting topic, but very dry in places...","Starting off with Biblical wives and ending in the modern-day, this book explores how wifehood has changed over the centuries. The author tries to keep a balance by mixing up straight research with personal accounts and it makes for a mostly good combination. However, sometimes it seemed like some chapters were a little light on history and heavy (repetitive in some cases) on individual accounts. In my opinion the first half of the book was more interesting than the second half."
3,"Okay, but Lacks Something","I bought this book hoping to find some inspiration for a podcast I do called (Over)Thinking Mom. I didn't necessarily dislike the book, but I found the observations not particularly interesting. The book also doesn't offer a lot of depth on any particular topic, likely the result of its ambitious scope, so I'm not sure I can blame the author completely for only touching on the topics. However, I would classify the level of analysis at the History: 101 level, which isn't bad, but I was looking for something more academic. This is a good starting place if you have a limited knowledge of history, but if you are looking for in depth analysis of trends or people, you might want to try something else. My search continues..."
1,So poorly edited that it is misleading,"Just on page 143:""Longleaf"" as the name of an estate should be Longleat. It's very well known.Joan ""Haywire"" should be Joan Hayward.""Marie Marvin"" should be either Maria Audley (as she called herself; a latinized form of her given name with her father's title) or Mary Touchet (the English form of her given name with her father's surname). Her mother was Lucy (aka Lucia) Marvin/Mervyn.Any attempt to correct the book's errors would be exhausting."
3,.....,"This book is well written and thoughtfully organized. It covers a wild range of period, therefore, locks of many perspectives and valuable details. For example, the book mentions nothing about Asian wifes among many other things. It is truely unfortunate because this is an area worth people's time learning.I think this book is best for the age group of 12 to 18. It is a good start for anyone who is interested in women's study."
4,Enjoying the introduction to some of my kids rock n roll.,I listen more to rock that I grew up with than the stuff my kids grew up with so I was pleasantly surprised to hear some of the music on this album. Enjoying most of the music.
1,Oh Who CARES,Power Ballads CAN THEY END ALREADY!!! Yet again another complimation of Power Ballads from the 70s and 80s theres only about 50 power ballad collections on the market already. You get the basics la la la who cares already most of these bands on here are pretty crappy(except a select few) but lets get to the big pictureWhat would you rather listen too Lady by the Styx or Purple Haze by jimi hendrix.
1,Go For The Original!,"You can't do better than reading Spurgeon's works in the original writings. Any time that is spent searching for a word that has been dropped from 'common' usuage, will be repaid with a better understanding of this marvellous writer's relationship with the Lord.He is called the 'Prince of Preachers' because of his ability to communicate the gospel in a way that reaches men and women from every walk of life. I know that this is true... I own the entire Metropolitan Pulpit Library, and I wouldn't part with a page of it for any amount of money!"
5,Being A Woman Naturally: Dr. Jan McBarron's Guide to Natura,"I was intrigued by the book because its author is a medical doctor. I erroneously assumed that the doctor was the man on the cover. Wow, what a shock when I found out the author is actully the female. This book is a home run in helping me understand what do do naturally to take better care of myself. Obviously, the author practices what she preaches."
4,cute video,"My 3 year old granddaughter loves animals so I bought this for her to watch at my house. It also helps teach her that not all families are mommy, daddy and baby."
3,Learn How to Win Reality TV,"This book is by the same co-author who wrote the masterpiece The Action Hero's Handbook. The Action Hero's Handbook was a vast improvement on its predecessor the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook which was less humorous and more of an instructional manual not prepared to poke fun at itself. The Reality TV Handbook seems to be closer in style to the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook, full of great information for those who actually want to be reality TV stars but not much entertainment value for other readers. I would imagine in a year or so a better version of this book will arise like happened with The Action Hero's Handbook where the genre of reality TV and wanting to be a contestant will be made fun of a lot more combined with helpful information for would be contestants. At the moment though I'd say get this book if you actually want to be a reality TV star but if you don't wait for the more humorous and entertaining sequel to be published."
1,Reality TV Hack,I couldn't get past the Forward by Evan Marriott. Who cares about this? The authors are TV hacks who haven't produced one lick of decent television.
4,Comfortable shoe,"This shoe is very lightweight but very comfortable. Does provide more support than ""flip flops""."
3,The Laughing Jesus:,"The First part of the book is very informative, interesting and factual about historical religiousevents. The second half of the book is too lengthy unless you are planning to convert and become a Gnostic. Even then my guess is there is a better ""how to"" book out there. Mr. Freke should stick to writing about the historical aspects of Religion."
3,Great book but wish they would have left out all the 9-11 references,"I loved this book and have enjoyed reading about gnostic wisdom for years (Elaine Pagels!!!), but wish the authors would have left out all the references to 9-ll for those of us who do not buy into the mainstream media belief that the towers were attacked by ""outsiders""."
1,Slanderous not Enlightening,"I loved the Jesus Mysteries so much. I was so excited to see this book in the store. I brought it home and could barely but down my bag before I opened it up. And that is where it all went terribly wrong. Instead of giving us facts it gives us slander and ridicule. Instead of breaking down the historical inaccuracies of the Holy Books of the three Genisis connected world religions it attempts to give us the impression that believers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all idiotic and naive. It was more of a sales pitch for Gnosticism then an accurate portrayal of the majority of believers. I love the idea of the book and I am still a huge fan of The Jesus Mysteries but I was extremely dissappointed. (I also missed the inclusion of footnotes in so many places). Instead of this book read The Bible Unearthed. It gives the information without tearing people apart and calling them names."
5,A must-read book!,"I won't provide a summary of the book's content and key messages, as other reviewers have done that very well. This book is essential reading for anyone with an interest in religion and/or the mystery of life. If you read this book with an open mind (i.e. not as a stout religious person) you'll likely conclude that the literalist religions are a dreadful lie."
4,Freke and Gandy Did it Again!,"My first experience with these two brilliant British authors/researchers came with the book, ""The Jesus Mysteries""! They document what they put on paper and leave little doubt as to how factual they are. ""The Laughing Jesus"" follows suit. I strongly recommend their work."
3,"Good Christian critic, awful Muslim assessment","The authors make several good references regarding Christianity & Gnosticism but when it mentions Islam & Muhammad, they lack any good references. As a matter of fact it seems the response to Islam seem more personal and emotional instead of scholarly. With that said I would give the book stars.What Da Vinci Really Didn't Want You To Know: The Jesus Conspiracy"
5,Released from bondage of fundmentalism!,"Reading the ""Laughing Jesus"" has released me even more from the bondage of fundmentalism. I grew up in a ""fundie"" church and thought from the get go I was domed to hell despite what I did to make my life better. Nothing seemed to work...I was so full of guilt and shame all the time that it drove me crazy. I have seen in many people were this has caused a mental disorder. We could deplete much of the world problems if everyone was to ""love each other"" and not so tied up in the literal world. We can change the world if we all work together and change lives and lived Lucidly but we must start to change now and we can live better lives. I am not meaning we all get more money but we have peace of mind and heart and not be so judemental on each on every little thing we do. May ya all find the peace that ya are looking for."
3,Meh,"The writing style may be easy to read, but it also gives the book an air of light fiction rather than serious discourse. I was never convinced that the information contained inside was accurate, and some of the views they presented on Paul and other ancient ""gnostics"", I personally felt were just plain misleading. If you are interested in the subject, I would recommend you first read ""The Age of Reason"" by Thomas Paine, then pick up anything you can find by Bart Ehrman (brilliant).Anyway, these are just my opinions. Read the book and decide for yourself."
2,Disappointed this time,"I am a huge Buffett Fan, I have seen him every year for the last 10 years. This Album is too country, I was expecting something more Fun! If you're a die-hard Fan, buy it for your collection, otherwise buy Live Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays"
3,"Not Quite a Parrothead's Dream, But Still Good!","This is a standard Jimmy Buffet album, not much special. Some of the songs I enjoyed very much, like Captain America, while others didn't do much for me, such as Ain't He A Genius? I wouldn't recommend unless you are a true Parrothead."
2,If you don't have Down to Earth and High Cumberland Jubilee,This album is the same as Down to Earth and High Cumberland Jubilee and was already previewed in the Before the Beach compilation
5,perfect little black dress,"Wow! I love this dress, its perfect for summer wear, and covers all the ""problem"" areas."
5,Indispensible!,This dictionary style reference book is so well put together and written with great insight and authority by the author on a vast number of spiritual topics. Easy to understand and fascinating to read. Definitely a keeper!
4,Work well,These have been wonderful on my vehicle. The only downside is the automatic shutting of the windows won't work because it registers something is in the track.
1,False attribution of author,"I know the person listed as so-called ""author"" and he has stated that he did not write this text. It was ghost-written and his name was used without permission by the publisher. Unfortunately, Amazon has ignored my request to remove this title from the catalog, which does not even have a real ISBN number."
3,Good but too dated now,"Lots of tips but it seems a bit dated in 2012...sadly prices have gone higher and those areas that were ""affordable"" are really not now."
5,Clear and convincing,"The author makes a very clear case for a change in the United States' approach to Syria, in the context of the rise of fundamentalism and cross-border terrorism. Timely, nuanced, and thought-provoking."
2,Not a great movie,"Talk, talk, talk I bought this on the recommendation of a friend only to find out that he gave me the wrong title. I am very open minded when it comes to movies. I like everything documentaries, adventure, Sci-fi, etc... so flicks like this are often in my Que. But, this movie was boring and tedious. Hipster couples talking about there stupid hipster poop over and over till you just want to jump through the screen and punch them saying ""Grow the hell up!"". It's a nice try by the film maker but it is obviously playing to a different crowd."
4,Nice mirror ball,"Mirror ball is basketball-sized and hangs by a good sized metal eye bolt. Motor casing is a little flimsy, but sturdy enough to hold the ball. Weak link is definitely the spotlight. Color lenses are nice, but light is just too dim to be useful."
1,wont fit,"Sent for these which were huge,called to return items,missed call and never heard from retaier..So I guess they only give you one chance,after that your on your own."
1,You better not have two left feet or be a beginner...,"I bought this DVD because it said it included ""beginner modifications so anyone can do it"" on the packaging. I tried it once and only made it through the first 10 minutes. The warm-up with weights did have modifications (don't use weights). However, the aerobic steps were very complicated. So much so I could not begin to keep up. Admittedly,I have two left feet, but this was so complicated I will not even try again. If you do not have experienced in aerobics or have trouble picking up complicated moves, buy something else."
4,Good Firm Workout,"I'm a HUGE Firm follower and this DVD is good. If you are already a firm follower, it will be an easy DVD to follow. If you are a beginner, it will be a good one to set the pace. The moves are easy to follow. It's not as difficult or challenging as some of the others, but I still enjoy this one."
3,great time crunch workout!,"I have them all I am a junkie (see my other reviews)and this is still a solid workout even though it is only about 40 min. Emily is a self professed lunger and proves it a couple times in this video with differnt sets of walking lunges.It really gets the heart pumping! The only downfall is there is not enough abs but what do you want for the time given? Still I put this in the rotation after my two hard days(500 calorie workout-dangerous curves ahead) as a bit of a break...one comment she looks so much different now, had a fantastic makeover but still like her either way she is motivating and just seems like the girl next door."
1,cuing where?,"Time and time again I give this workout a try but the step always get me upset. The warm up trows my off, when she says double I don't know what I am suppose to double. The plus side is that I do sweat a lot and that we do squats and lunges. She also includes an ab section. I am very disappointed, I wish I would have saved my money for a different Firm workout."
4,It's great as long as you can keep up,"If you know the lingo of the Firm gals and know the names of the moves, etc. then this dvd is awesome and you can feel it. If you are truly out of shape and think you can keep up with this, think again. It's hard core, I love it but I wouldn't recommend it to new exercisers."
5,Great All Around,"This is further proof that the folks at the FIRM know how to create a soild workout. The cardio gets your heart pumping, and the sculpting moves get your muscles burning! Emily is a good intructor, she cues well. You'll need 3 sets of weights light, medium and heavy. I really like the abs moves in this one, they were challenging. I use this dvd in my rotation frequently."
4,Pretty good workout :-),"This is another good Firm workout. It's using basic choreography and it's designed more for an intermediate exerciser. Emily's cuing isn't quite as good as someone like Kari Anderson or Amy Dixon, but it's not too hard to follow along with.You get alternating intervals of weights and cardio and you can always do some movement variations to make it a little tougher if you want to. When it comes to the cardio, it's not overly dancy so that portion is easy to follow (cuing could again be a bit better). I like how with the toning, you begin with basic moves and add on different muscles to maximise the effect and your heart rate stays up which is good for the burning fat and calories.This is a pretty good workout that I've only done twice so far, but I enjoy it and think many people can gain benefits from this. It might be a little frustrating at first if you can't follow due to her cuing, but once you get it, it's fun to do and effective for sure."
4,Good work-out but takes practice,"I confess I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but I found some of the cardio moves a little tricky to follow. I've done this work-out twice now, and I'm getting better, but it will probably take me a few more times before I have the moves down really well. However, I think this is a good work-out. I consider myself an intermediate-level exerciser, and I worked up a good sweat. I bought this one at the same time as The Firm Boot Camp Maximum Calorie Burn, and the Burn and Shape is definitely the easier of the two. The Burn and Shape does more sculpting with weights and is shorter at about 40-45 minutes. I like that it gives me a good work-out without requiring lots of equipment. You just need 3 sets of dumbbells."
5,Intriguing perspective,A different perspective on the study and practice of herbs as useful plants. This is not a dry listing of herb plants or factoids. Its more of a lovely coffee-table browsing volume designed to give you a peek into how or why people grow what they choose to grow for their own pleasure. A keeper.
4,Good Recent History of Copyright Law,"This is a good book if you want a detailed history of how copyright law evolved to accomodate digital technology and the Internet. That is the focus of Litman's work. Her writing is engaging and straightforward, and she has good reasons for being pessimistic and disappointed with the current Copyright Act."
3,"Good information, feels dated in approach","If you need this information, it will satisfy you. Not particularly fun to read about (maybe because it feels slightly old or behind the times), but probably helped lay the foundation for current thoughts on copyright. I prefer Pirate's Dilemma or Lawrence Lessig (Code, Remix) instead."
2,disappointing,"After glancing at some reviews, I had high hopes of getting a more in depth and precise understanding of digital copyright law. What I found though was a book, while effectively advancing some broad arguments, did not provide me with the kind of in depth detail that I would expect from a first rate book. At the end of the book, I cannot say that I better understand what is legal, what is not legal, and what is unclear in the modern age of digital copyright.If you want an overview and critique of the context and process in which copyright laws have been passed, then this book might be for you. But if you're looking for a detailed explanation and investigation of current copyright laws, I think this book will leave you hanging."
2,I was disappointed even though I didn't wanna' be :<,"I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Blackburn by Denton and figured I'd equally love everything else he'd written, but it really felt as if lost interest in this book about 3/4's of the way through it. It felt he got bored. I sure did. I'll still read everything else he's done and hope it's more on the scale of Blackburn. Just one man's opinion."
5,chapstick moisturzer,"This is the only product I have found that works to keep my dry mouth/lips moist. I don't know why Chapstick is not supplying this product at stores anymore, but I am so glad that Amazon provides this product. Thank you Amazon!!!"
5,Pleasantly surprised!!!,"Even after reading the other glowing reviews for this product, I still wasn't sure that this would live up to the hype for a preschooler who knew most of the shapes. But it did! The ""songs"" help reinforce shapes, like heptagon vs. hexagon. My daughter is singing the songs and talking about trapezoids like it is a commonplace shape that all 3 year olds know.I bought this DVD to test it out on something my daughter basically understood before purchasing the DVDs in the series which cover new concepts for her. Needless to say, we have gotten 2 more Munchkin Math DVDs."
1,out of date topic & procedures,"Manual bookkeeping in lot of detail but we live in a computerized world. Better books show how to use QuickBooks and other automated programs, this one is designed for doing everything by hand. Outdated! Recommend looking for more up to date books with computer emphasis instead."
2,"Not a bad book, but not what it seems","About three quarters of the way through this book, I was ready to throw it out the window. I am biased on the issue of Ronald Reagan, I am a huge fan of his. I wasn't angry just because the book was mostly in criticism of Reagan, but I didn't like that it showed more bad than good, and I think that that is unfair. However, after reading through the whole book (an encouraged practice before making a judgement, and writing a review), I found that, while I believe that Kenneth Walsh is anti-Reagan, he did an okay job of portraying the good side of Reagan as well, but by no means sufficient. I don't think that this book is what it says it is: an unbiased portrait of the Reagan legacy; but rather, a censure in disguise."
1,"Only ONE reel sent, not SIX. False Advertising","If you think you are getting a good deal for SIX reels (because SIX are depicted in the item photo), you've been had. Only ONE item was shipped, and that is obviously overpriced (Adorama and B&H both only charge 8 bucks for the same item). False advertising. For shame! And a terrible waste of my time too!"
4,Not a meltdown but still impressive,"What we have here is a melding of old and new and that's not all bad contrary to the previous review. Mark Hummel is the guiding force and is one of the best in the biz for West Coast harping. Also helping out is Muddy Waters' former drummer Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith who started out on harp.Disc 2 is special, being split between Carey Bell and Lazy Lester. I enjoy guitar more that harp and Steve Freund is simply okay in his roll as backup. Just as well, it's the harp that takes this stage."
2,Still have Mice,"I'm not sure if this didn't work b/c it wasn't one of the more expensive ones, or that electromagnetic rodent repellers don't work in general, but this one was a bust. Other reviews said it would take a couple days in which you may see an increase in mice, but then they should disappear. Well I gave it 3+ weeks and I still have mice. I plugged it in right where I know they are entering my apartment, so not as if it's not in the proper placement. I'm back to using inhumane glue traps, but that is the only thing that seems to work."
1,Not worth it.,"Don't waste your money, this product doesn't work. It worked for a week and the light went off and never came back on again. I tried it in different rooms and I'm still waiting..."
1,Piece of junk,Do not buy this useless paperweight. I had this device less than 2 months before it stopped functioning. While it functioned it didn't do anything to repel mice...I think it actually made them hyperactive. It is 1 month too late to return this junk to Amazon so I am SOL if manufacturer doesn't have a decent warranty.
3,Just the facts?,"Buyers shouldn't make an ""a priori"" assumption for these devices. The data to back up these claims isn't made readily available and in 2001 the FTC handed down a mandate that manufacturers of these devices must back up their claims with data, see FTC web site ""[...]""."
2,Can't really tell,"Seemed to work at first , but then not only did we see a return of mice, but also a few rats. Have used in conjunction with the Home Sentinel but still getting thieving rodents. Had hoped I wouldn't have to resort to more traditional methods."
1,"Poor quality, poor packaging","First pitcher received was shattered. Second was received with a large crack at the handle. Both were poorly packaged. The glass had multiple flaws, bubbles, black spots and chips. Since the ice bucket arrived with the same glass flaws, I have to assume [company name} is selling Lara Glass seconds not first quality items."
2,"Great vase, miserable pitcher","No quality problems as other reviewers have noted, but very poor pouring characteristics...slops down the outside and all over table unless pouring verrrrrrry slowly. Ice in the pitcher? Enjoy the waterfall!"
1,Worse Pitcher design - liquid goes everywhere,"I wish I would have seen some of the reviews before buying. It was the worse pitcher. Terrible design, and the liquid goes everywhere. Very Upset and disappointed with the design. If I could rate a 0 or negative number I would. It is a worthless product."
5,Variety,This product was excellent because it allowed me to try various types of paper and decide which one was the best for each individual print.
3,Canon Paper Asst 13 x 19,While I like this Product I would like to know why the price doubled after I purchased it. This is not an incentive for future purchases
5,Digging in the Dirt,"Another really fine Worms album. The 'classics' on this one are Celine Dion, Rocks and Trees, and I am Cow, but just as good are the less familiar Gaelic Song, Johnny Came Home Headless and Steel Drivin' Man. They throw in the usual spot-on country&western song (is it Trevor who has the C&W fixation?) and round out the album with a wide variety of good, solid, funny songs. I'm always impressed how they manage to get the 'sound' right for whatever style song they're singing, from bluegrass to caribbean, and as always, the singing is tight and the harmonies are right. And the lyrics can make you snort drinks out your nose if you're not careful."
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!!,"This is one of the fuuniest comedy albums I have ever heard. It doen't make me belly laugh, but, unlike many comedy albums, I can listen to this over and over again and still get twisted meanings and puns from it. One word of caution...if you can't find humor in just about every situation on earth, stay away from the Arrrogant Worms. There is nothing they won't, and don't, lampoon."
5,Unforgettable,"As a lover of history, and long fascinated by Shanghai, this DVD was wonderful. I had known about this remarkable slice of WWII/Holocaust, and by having those who experienced Shanghai as a (dreadful) haven speak, their history became unforgettable for me."
1,Great For Minorities / Woman Entrepreneurs,"But I'm not a minority or a woman. So, needless to say, it wasn't completely relevant. Some decent principles in here but don't purchase based on the title or the description of the book. Did a quick search on my kindle and the word minority shows up 139 times (and that's not including abbreviations). Wish I would have known before purchasing..."
2,Good idea; shamefully poor quality,"I have several Cuthbertson Verb Wheels, which have seen me through Latin, Spanish, and French classes from high school to university and beyond. The idea is brilliant. Unfortunately, the new product is shabbily made and an insult to the original.My French verb wheel somehow disappeared, so I ordered a new one recently. Was appalled by the quality. It looks as though it's been photocopied--and on a cheap machine! The print is splotched and broken, evidence of a multiple-generation copy. The paper is so flimsy that I had to spend time and money laminating it. I have my original Latin and Spanish wheels--good printing on sturdy cardboard--which are in great condition after several decades of use."
2,"Thorough, but disappointing.","Thanks for the opportunity to review the Verb Wheel.I have found it very hard to use because of the size and type of font used, basically.I'm 65, and I use glasses, but it is still difficult to deal with.This is a shame because informationwise it's loaded !So..a flawed gem, in a sense.Phil Bird"
2,French Verb wheel,The French Verb Wheel is impossible to read even with a magnifying glass. When you rotate the wheel you can't read the endings because of the size and poor ink quality.
1,Terrible,"Very poor quality and condition. Looks as if if had been photocopied, not printed. Fuzzy fonts impossible to read or use."
5,"Great tie, exactly as shown.","I ordered this tie for my husband, since we're a household of Blazer fans, and what's better than being able to wear team-affiliated gear while still dressing in shirt and tie for dresscode? It's just as described, well-made, and looks deceptively like a regular tie when worn."
4,If you do a lot of drilling,An excellent drill bit especially in locations where constant pressure can not be maintained (overhead and reaching out). Stalls once the self feed portion punches through joist or stud. Needs high torque drill to work effectively but shaft bends easily if paddles bind or excessive/off center pressure is applied. Have had the self feed pilot break off in denser woods. Definately drills quicker than a standard spade bit. Higher priced for a disposable bit but a real nice pouch.
4,useful,these bits are great. typical spade bit require a lot of force behind the drill to force them through. the threads on the end of these suck the bit right through the wood you are drilling into. it's a lot cheaper than going out and buying a hole hawg. the only drawback is that i tend to use larger bits more. i haven't even found a use for the smaller ones.
2,Warmed over Feel good Tips,"I don't recommend this book. It gives you daily bits of encouraging food for thought and none of it too inspiring. If you see it at a flea market or can get it for free, then by all means do so. But if you have to pay more than a dollar for it--don't!"
1,used and bad condition generator,"I really feel very badly, I saw a new generator for sale and they sent a used generator to me, you nowhere you said it; recive in bad conditions and with spots in several parts, misadjusted and almost does not ignite, so that they do this with people, I am not wanted to lose but money, if it could gave it, does not continue doing that, please!"
2,"Good idea, but could be better made","The ice mat was the most useful, you can just throw it on the bottom of a cooler and pack the stuff on top. The individual ice cubes just aren't rugged enough. I had a few of them pop after 2 uses. I now put them in sandwich bags, but how useful is that?"
5,great item,Using for my lunches now but when hurrican season shows up they will be used...thanks for a great item.
2,Not what i would expect from 7l & ES,"When i first picked up on this rap duo back in 2000 i couldnt believe how good it was. Soul purpose, DC were off the hook. DC2 was alrigt and then this new joint. I couldnt believe my ears wehen i heard this junk. ES raps about ""i like books/i like amy smarts looks""...goes on to say he likes roast beef sandwhiches or some thing along the lines of that. VERY DISSAPOINTED! If you want a new 7l joint, buy MOMENT OF RARITIES. its old 7l & es thats been released. I dont know where they are going but i dont like it and i think they should have stuck to thier old hip hop routine."
1,If you like babytalk...,"Then you'll like this album. Anyone can ask me about the other c.d.'s and I'm not gonna' lie Esoteric ripped it up and remained my fav m.c. for a while... until the AOTP c.d. and this dropped. What the f*ck happened? He tried to change his style or something, but it just sounds like babytalk or someone whining in half the songs. The other ones, it sounds like he's trying to outwit someone as HALF-witted as 50 cent. Esoteric could've destroyed any mainstream fool in moments with his style and speed in freestyles, but that level of hardcore raw rap has dropped with this album. 7L i was never a huge fan of anyway, but I did respect many of his beats. However, on this c.d. Not one. Which is possibly just added to because Eso handles many of the beats..."

5,Beautifully performed,I have heard quite a few recorded performances of the piano works of Erik Satie and these are BY FAR the best I've heard. Most other performances seem dull or rushed or too precise or... just as if the performer for some reason didn't quite grasp the subtleties involved in bringing a piano work by Satie to life. The dynamics and subtle touch of Yuji Takahashi's playing is remarkable. You just gotta hear it for yourself. I can't say it better than Yuji Takahashi played it.
4,School Book Review,Do you know how hard it was to live in the 1930s? I read a book about a girl who lived then. The book is called Meet Kit by Valerie Tripp. Kit went from rich to poor over night. Kit looses her room and moves into her attic. Kit looses many things but makes up for them. This is a great book because Kit is a smart girl surviving the depression. This book has a great picture on almost every page. It had a picture when Kit and Ruthie were eavesdropping on grownups. I think the author's message was people that lived way before us had hard lives. Read this book to find out what Kit does to make herself happier.
4,Love the Book,The girl we gave this to has just started her collection of American Girl stories. The company we ordered the book from was very kind and helpful and when an issue did come up they were quick and fair in resolving it. If they ever have another item we want I will use them again.
3,"Beautiful, but needs organization","I subscribe to the magazine, but I thought it would be nice to have all the receipes for the year in one place and bound so that I wouldn't have to worry about losing any. So I thought it was a great idea to have a book like this one. I was really excited when I got it; I love Martha's receipes and the photos are always great. Unfortunately, the book is arranged by months, so it is impossible to browse for say, dessert receipes--they are scattered all over the book! I thought that if they were going to put all the receipes together they would at least organize them somehow, other than by month. What a disappointment!"
3,Definately Classic Martha,"What can we say? This is a very good cookbook, but not for the average cook on an ""everyday"" budget. But then, of course, Martha's tv shows are not for us either. Anyways, there are many good recipes, and I like Martha's shows and have her other books. But, in my opinion, her Comfort Foods Cookbook was her finest hour."
3,Organized by Months?,"I had very high expectations for this cookbook. I was extremely disappointed to find the cookbook organized by months, rather then by recipe type. ie. desserts, main courses, etc....Who sits down to plan a meal and thinks...hmnnn...it's Spring Time...I'll look for all the Spring recipes? Not me (a trained French Chef).I found using the index to search for recipes difficult. I finally ended up paging thru the entire book (it's lengthy) to find the exact recipe that I was looking for.I tried a couple of the recipes and they turned out good (but not excellent).I would skip buying this book. Take it for a test drive from the local library first. Only buy it if you can deal with the organization of the recipes."
1,ZERO Stars for McCulloch,"Weak PLASTIC Sprocket gear strips out after about an hour of normal use. McCulloch has not been in business for years, will not repair or supply parts. Warranty useless.This could have been a good tool, but for the poor design of the PLASTIC GEAR. It is the weak point and fails rapidly with normal use.Perhaps designed to strip to protect the motor? But it cannot handle even normal torque.Unacceptable for normal yard use."
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"I received the first stand and had to call and complain as one of the legs was buckled and not lining up with the others, the second one arrived and while putting it together the collar came off one of the legs, it was a good thing I still had the 1st one laying around as I was able to use a leg from that one to put the 2nd one together. It is very cheaply made and I do not suggest you get this stand if you have kids or dogs in your home as it will easily tip over, save your money and go for a sturdier stand."
1,DO NOT BUY. Terrible Quality,"This stand is worth maybe 5 dollars. the bottom 5 gallon part refused to fit onto any of its holders, the legs are bent and wobbly, and overall the construction and quality was a terrible experience. the stand is not sturdy nor is it anywhere close to level. I refuse to put my tank on it simply because i know it will fall over and break my aquarium. The legs didn't even fit into their slots for the top part either. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Spend the extra cash, it's worth your money."
1,don't buy,"leg brackets don't line up properly. i had to use pliers to adjust brackets so legs would fit. paint flaking off after assembly and very flimsy and not square. i was so aggravated, i threw it in the trash without ever using it or returning it to the store."
4,transparent review,The movie was interesting. I wish they would have gone into more detail with the lives of both the parents and the children. Instead they just move from little clip to little clip weaving back and forth between all of the trans families which made it a little difficult to follow.
4,Pleased with Purchase,"I received the chapsticks I ordered in a timely manner and without damamges. The packaging was open when it got to my home which is why I gave a 4 star rating, but all the chapsticks were there."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail, I couldn't wait to put it in and have some fun... I was very disappointed with the songs on this CD. Many of the songs from the Fallen album sounded too slow or something... They just didn't capture what I had come to expect. I didn't find it to be of good quality at all... I wish I had bought the top tunes karaoke CD before it was discontinued..."
2,Disappointing ending,"The story had a lot of potential that kept me interested. The characters could have been more believable,especially Caroline's. The ending was the weakest part of the story, which really annoyed me."
4,Insightful,"I love her ways of seeing inside peoples normally hidden thoughts. I think Laura felt a lot of things we all feel about people we love, alot of it negative but hidden inside so as not to offend or disrupt. I wish she had shown more of the final interaction between caroline and the mother, though. I wanted to read more dialogue between the two of them by the time I got to the end...kind of disapointed that she ended it so abruptly.Also, I liked the chilling images of the child left behind...which often happens in more families then we know...."
4,Riveting Tale of Family Dynamics,"I have only read a few of this author's previous works, and was not a loyal fan. This book made me one! I read it in one day and wanted to start all over again once I finished. The family drama is a bit reminiscent of Jane Smiley's ""A Thousand Acres"", but definitely not a knock-off. It was a wonderful exploration of the mother daughter and sibling relationships within a family. Further, Ms. Berg's technique of using photographic imagery at the beginning of most chapters to ""illuminate"" the themes was effective and thought-provoking. The only thread I would have liked to have seen developed is the relationship between Caroline and her daughter, Eva. All we are told was that Eva was grown and moved to California - which in itself is telling, I suppose, but are we left to speculate too much about the meaning of this? I am curious to know what others think."
2,You can do a lot better Elizabeth,"I work in a library and couldn't wait for this book to come in. I think I've read nearly everything Berg has written but was so disappointed in this book. Perhaps because I had just read a true-crime book about real child abuse, this story seemed hollow and sloppily put together and never rang true. The characters were undeveloped and too shallow. Was this written quick to satisfy some contract with the publisher? Sure seems like it."
5,A wonderful read!!,I loved all the characters in the book!!! It was a joy to read from beginning to end!! I was having a hard time putting it down!!
3,Not her best....,I usually really love Elizabeth Berg's books. While i did read this one in 2 days...it surely lacked the depth and character of some of her early works. Everyone perceived Caroline as crazy...until the true secret was revealed near the end of the book. I wish I could have given this book 4 stars...but it fell short by a few chapters!
1,Boring as hell,"I was not at all impressed with this book. I was in suspense waiting to hear of that horrible things Caroline had dealt with and how they would be handled by her mother, but the descriptions were rather bland. Very disappointing."
3,unrealistic,the story tells of a sister who gathers her two siblings together and conveys things that their mother had done to her and her alone when they were children. the siblings have a difficult time believing this has actually happened and the sister is in great turmoil as this suddenly seems to have come to a head for her and she needs to get her issues resolved.the author barely scratches the surface with the subject matter and the ending just does not seem at all plausible. berg builds up to a climax that never happens.
1,Lacking in emotional depth and character development,"I loved Berg's earlier works, like Talk Before Sleep and Range of Motion, but this latest book is not worth reading. Now that Berg is putting out a book each year, she has sacrificed the sensitivity and depth I saw in her previous works. Better luck next time."
2,needs mending,"This book was a complete waste of time. I have always admired Berg's humorous and yet poignant understanding of women. This book seemed to be something the author literally threw together in a day just to turn something in. I felt as if I was betrayed; that the story or lack thereof and the poorly drawn characters did not matter to the creator and therefore mattered even less to me. If this is your first time reading Elizabeth Berg, do yourself a favor and try Pull of the Moon or Say When. Please do not judge this book by it's interior. I'm not giving up on one of my favorite authors yet...neither should you."
4,Good Book by a Great Author,"I just love Elizabeth Berg. I read an article she had written in Parents magazine, in fact, I read several, but one was a diary she had kept when her daughter was a baby. I remember reading it, thinking ""This woman is writing exactly what I feel."" Then I saw she wrote books, and I anxiously drove from library to library in my area to read everything she had written!This book may not have been her best, and the end was a little disappointing, but she has such a way with words.....yes, this was worth the time, and then go back and read everything she has written. It's almost poetic how she views life. I enjoy the ""domestic-detail overdoses."" That's what makes her books so real. Enjoy!"
2,Better Berg?,"I'd read Berg's writing book and decided to check out one of her novels. I believe, at least according to other reviewers, this isn't the best one. The story was okay, but the writing and characterization were fair. I was very disappointed after reading her book on writing (Escaping into the Open)--which was delightful.The Art of Mending left out the ""art"" part of it. It was difficult to finish because it seemed to be a rough draft--where the characters were just beginning to be fleshed out, but not quite there yet. There was no real climax. It read more like a boring memoir. And it didn't ring true in many places. The mother never seemed like a real person, just a pawn to move the story forward.I'm sure Berg is capable of better, so I'll read a couple of her other books. But this one fell flat."
2,Disappointing,"Elizabeth Berg has been a favorite author of mine since I read RANGE OF MOTION. Since then, I've read all her books, and although some haven't been quite up to the bar she set with her first couple of books, I've never been truly disappointed until now. THE ART OF MENDING simply isn't up to her standards. The characters, the plot, even the writing seem to belong to a lesser author. I finished the book--after all, it was Elizabeth Berg!--but by the end, I felt cheated. RECOMMENDATION: WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK."
3,Good but not Great,"Like many others I was looking forward to this new book and like others I was also a bit disappointed in the end. I enjoyed it and don't feel like I wasted my time, but I also think Elizabeth Berg can do better. The ending came together in a startlingly neat bow as if Berg suddenly thought, ""Ooops, have to end this pretty quickly!""I felt in particular the character of Caroline, the so called ""black sheep"" of the family wasn't fairly handled by using her sister--the narrator--as the only real source of information about her. Many of the characters seemed to think that Caroline was odd but very few of the anecdotes Laura relates about her actually left *me* feeling like Caroline's behavior was anything more (or less) than just different from what her siblings expected. That might be ""weird"" if you're an adolescent and working out sibling rivalry issues but I expect more from understanding from the adult Laura."
2,it's too bad.,"let me preface by saying that i am an ardent elizabeth berg fan, however, this book just does not meet the mark she set for herself with such fantastic pieces as ""durable goods"" and ""joy school."" the writing is still classic berg, but i find it stale in this work because there is no story to ground it. the story is weirdly predictable and i found the characters unimaginative and uninteresting. it seems as if berg was trying to take a cliched story and turn it into something prolific by throwing in some futile last-minute twists and shockers. however, those methods fail, as they always do. it is too little, too late. berg is at her best when the writing is clear and honest and driven, and here the focus of the book is muddy and boring, not to mention trite. i am let down, yes, but i look forward to a brighter berg future. after all, every author has an off book once in awhile, right?"
3,Not up to par,"Personally I don't believe that Berg has written a ""bad"" book, but in comparison to her others this falls short (my favorite is Open House). Not only were most of the characters unlikeable but I found myself bored with most of the book--I had to force myself to finish it. Typically Berg writes with great wit and insight, but this one failed to exemplify that. And why is it in most of her books (at least the ones I have read anyway) the mothers are so flawed--abusive, absent, wacky, mentally ill, etc.???"
4,"SECRETS, LIES AND INTRIGUE","""The Art of Mending"" is one of Berg's best novels to date. Laura, Stevie and Caroline, three siblings, visit their parents' home each year and attend the state fair. However, on their most recent visit, an air of mystique and uncertainty prevails. Caroline has a secret she wants to discuss with her brother and sister that completely rocks the family. In the process, their father dies and throws the family into chaos.The positive aspects of this book are the strong plot and anticipation that builds throughout the pages. It is a real page turner and the climax is not at all predictable. The only reason the book lost a star in the rating is the character development was just a little weak, especially with Stevie and Laura. Overall, the book was enjoyable and was written is Berg's sensitive, graceful and unique style."
2,You call that an ending?!,"I bought this book because I had just read a book by Elizbeth Berg that I loved (Say When). This book started great and I was flying through it. I suddenly realized that I had at most 10 pages to go before the book was done and there was absolutely NO WAY the story was going to have a solid ending. I was right, it didn't. For the amount of emotional build-up the novel had, the ending was so completely ridiculous. Laura's sister, Caroline, sopposedly endured a horrible childhood due to her mother. The whole entire book was about the injustices Caroline suffered at the hands of her mother and about obtaining her siblings acknowledgement of such things. And then it just ended. Caroline suddenly forgets her YEARS of misery (that we spent PAGES reading about) and then the book is complete? What the heck?"
4,If you pull but one thread it can all unravel,"This is a story of a family, and the inequities in the dynamics between family members. The family in the story has gathered for their annual reunion and visit to the Minnesota state fair. Everyone is planning on looking at the animals, riding the rides and gorging on junk food. But Laura Bartone's sister, Caroline, has other plans. She wants an evening alone with Laura and their brother Steve to discuss something. Tragedy strikes the family and Caroline's discussion consists of accusations against their mother. Each of the siblings must examine their own childhood as they knew it to reconcile the differences and mend the family. As always, Elizabeth Berg's prose flows and draws you into the story. She prefaces a number of the chapters with the description of a photo that Laura is examining in her quest for understanding her sister Caroline."
3,Really? 2.5 stars,"I'm with the brother....and, nutmeg in mashed potatoes?? blech........The story was ""ok"" I'm not sure if North Dakota is really ready for a flamboyantly gay fabric store manager, but hey, I could be wrong. Mean Mommy or Mean Sister: The drama really wasn't dramatic. I did stay with it till then end and there were places that I thought it was well done. The rest--often pretentious, often just not ""quite ?"" But, not ""quite"" WHAT?? It misses it's mark."
3,Some Visible Stitching,"It is said that one child is chosen in a dysfunctional family to receive all the crap. If this is so, Berg does a good job of showing how separate the realities of children who grow up in the same home can be. How that role sets them on a track for trouble in their adult life - jobs, marriage, future relationships with siblings.Mostly, I liked the main character's home. Her sloppy but loving existence and the idea that she spends her days in a studio filled with fabric and creativity creating quilts.I hope it's true, that our patchwork of experiences can be sewn together to make a beautiful covering.Berg's writing is a bit sloppy but it does get the job done."
3,Definitely not her best....,"Elizabeth Berg is my favorite author. When I saw she had a book out I had not read I snatched it up. From the beginning I hated this book. All the characters were undeveloped, unrealistic and Caroline was just flat out annoying. I continued reading although I had no real interest in how the book would end. I mean, nothing really happened throughout the entire book. The end was shocking (out of the blue and blunt) but a welcome relief for me; now I can start something good.I'm just glad I knew how talented a writer Elizabeth Berg was before I read this atrocity."
4,Great for beginner to intermediate,"What I really like about this DVD is that it's not discouraging to someone who is a beginner or someone getting back into running after having a baby or just being away from running for a while. There are three people in the video all working at different levels so you can keep up with whomever you're most comfortable. There are no difficult aerobics moves that are hard to follow and you can go at your own pace. (I almost always ""jog"" more than they jog on the video and ""run"" more than they run to boost my own workout level a little bit.) Debbie Rocker, who is the trainer in this DVD, is far less annoying than Leslie Sansone (a well-known trainer who does a lot of walking videos). Bless Leslie's heart... She means well, but she's pretty annoying. My advice is to use this DVD as a guide and cater it to your own needs. Personally, I think it's worth owning."
4,Keeps you engaged,I like this walking DVD. It keeps me engaged at all times in a short period of time. I truly feel like I've worked out.
5,Perfect gift,"I purchased this bowl a few months ago for myself, and since then I have purchased 3 more for gifts. It is a beautiful piece to have in your collection. Especially nice server for special occasions."
1,Horrible,"This book was just as the title says. I guess we should have seen it coming. After all the other clones started appearing out of nowhere (the pink smocks, devons, chris skinner and all those other ones, not to mention the clones of celebrities etc), Amy's ""destiny"" to save the world and the shrinking number of page numbers, the books were slowly but obviously detiorating. I can honestly say it was a likely candidate for the world's worst book. If you haven't read this book yet, DON'T. If you own it, all I can say is don't read the last chapter. The rest is bad enough...but that last chapter is all about ""humble"", ""dutiful"", and FLYING Amy. That's right. Flying. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!"
1,are you kidding me?!,"oh. my. god. is this some sort of joke? she learns to fly and becomes a superhero? umm....what was marilyn kaye smoking when she wrote this? not only would this storyline never work for any situation, but its too cliff-hanger-y. i mean come on, amy doesnt even get together with eric?! she just leaves her whole life behind to fly around the world saving people? ok if ANYONE was satisfied with this book please contact me!!! my email is ...i cant even believe it! this was such a good series but then it was like everyone came up with the worst possible endings and this was the worst of them all! gimme a break!"
1,what the heck???,ok there is only one word to discribe this book....[stinks]!!! i started reading these when i was about elven or twevle and as i got older they got stupider but i wanted to finish what i stared so i bought the ones i hadnt read and read them. they werent the greates books but they were good and i was enjoying them for a easy read but when i read this and i got to the end i was so dissapointed in marilyn kaye!!! i mean if you read the back you know that amy starts to lose her abilitys and when she gets them back is when it got really stupid i unsderstand why she wanted them back but kaye didnt have to do that i mean come on!!!! this was by farthe worst book i have ever read if you like this series i suggest only reading to war of the clones because that was a really good ending to the series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is just a horrible ending to these amazing series!I LOVED Replica 1-23 and I also loved the Plague Trilogy.But this last 24th Book is awful.First of all, Amy loses her powers.She acts really really selfish and she's kinda mean to her friends.Loved Amy (books 1-23) turns out to be an evil, mean girl.She teams up with the evil Adrian Peele.And in the end she is a FLYING Superhero that saves the world!!!!I nearly cried at the end, because this ending was nothing but horrible."
