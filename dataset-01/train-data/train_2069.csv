3,A good overall general book that lacks depth.,"This book by Dick Mills is a well formatted concise hand book. If you want to know a little about everthing aquarium related, this is the book for you. Unfortunately, most of what is covered in this book was not new to me, and the depth I was hoping for on some subjects was not present. The pictures are great, and there are lots of them, but to cover all species of even freshwater fish, you need a book that is a lot bigger, as I now know."
3,A GREAT START,"A Great first book. Very easy to read and filled with great color photos. However the information is very general and in some areas not available at all. 101 essential tips... fails to cover anything dealing with water testing, ammonia levels,nitrates,nitrites and the like.This seems to me, important information that the author for what ever reason left out all together. The section on the fish itself, although colorful and informative, is very brief. Even the most common spicies were left out. A good book that could have been alot better."
3,Ok for the price or a - - 3 stars,"Like all DK books this little (72 page) book is very pretty and well organized. Unfortunately it provides little info and also misleads the buyer. At first glance it appears to cover 101 fish (""101 Aquarium Fish"" is in large print) but only 40 fish are covered and 5 of these are just different types of goldfish. Of the remaining 61 ""Essential Tips"" included are: Tip #61-Clubs, discusing joining a club, and tip #45 Choosing Prepacked Food, showing photos of different food types ie flakes (2 types shown), pellets, tablets etc."
3,readable series,"This isnt as good as the first book but still pageturning.This time It is teen angel Nicoles mission and her mission-if she chooses to accept it,or doesnt she have a choice?,I dont know-is to prevent a young girl from having a baby."
3,"Interesting, but there are better","I read this one then immediately read Coyle's ""Lance Armstrong's War"" and there simply isn't any comparison. ""23 Days in July"" is ""inside"" only in the sense that the author was willing to jump some barriers and break some rules. Coyle's book is *truly* inside with insights Wilcockson doesn't even seem to be aware of. That, combined with Wilcockson's incredibly overblown style (he doesn't seem to have ever seen an adjective he didn't use) and his inability to spell ""Girona"" correctly (he consistently spells it ""Gerona""), left me sort of wishing I hadn't bothered."
3,Readable but not great,"""23 Days in July"" is a readable recounting of the action in last year's ('04) Tour, but does not do enough with regard to context, back story, or broader themes to rate high markings. As other reviewers have mentioned ""Lance Armstrong's War"" is much better book all-around, covering the '04 Tour and more.Recommended only for true cycling enthusiasts who would enjoy any books on the subject."
4,Very good historical perspective,"I've read almost all of the books on US Postal and Lance's reign as the 7-time Tour champ: Lance's 2 books, Daniel Coyle's masterful portrait of the champ, Matthew Berry's ""Inside the Postal Bus"", Samuel Abt's collections of cycling columns, and many others. The thing that stands out about this particular book, John Wilcockson's reflection on the 2004 Tour, is the historical perspective the author brings. Wilcockson has been covering the Tour since the mid-1960s, and that experience shows when he draws parallels between various events in the 2004 Tour and similar episodes in history. While I didn't find many new nuggets of information about Lance or the Postal team from this book, I did gain a much better appreciation for the history of the Tour and some of its past champions: Coppi, Merckxx, Hinault, et al. Wilcockson's writing is a welcome addition to the shelf of any serious cycling fan."
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!!,Lance takes his sixth Tour de France and with authority. He wins two time trials that were not even close. This book does a great job of giving an inside perspective of the tour. The author goes day to day in a very compelling and gripping way. I like how he intertwines historical tour de france events with those of today. He evens gives some short history lessons of what took place at various starting and end points. He not only gives praise where it is due but he also points out the negative publicity that surrounds Lance as well. This is a must read if you have a passion for cycling.
5,Excellent Value,"I bought one about a month ago and I love the value it provides. People complain about backlight issues but my experience with LCDs is that the picture will never be what us old-timers are used to seeing from our CRTs. There is some slight backlight bleed from the bottom but I have to look at the seam of the panel and bezel to really notice it.Other than that, the picture is vivid, no dead or stuck pixels and lots and lots of screen to goof around with.A solid buy for the money. Acer's really done a good job with this."
2,Disappointed,Smaller then expected. Spatula more like nylon then Teflon. Front edge melts and rolls under medium heat.Not worth the price.
3,Lessons Learned,"Owning this, my first high-def TV, has taught me a lot,Pros:-Very good picture (although not the, ""Wow!"" you get when viewing others)-Two HDMI inputsCons:-No 1080p-Only 60 Hz-No DLP-No digital audio in-No dedicated DVI to connect a computer-Built-in tuner is extremely slow, essentially unusable-Built-in speakers are terrible, definitely going to need an external amp and stereo or surround sound speakers-The ballast went out after 18 months. $300 part $300 labor.The repair man stated that bad ballasts are a common problem with this product line. Thus, buy the extended warranty if you purchase this or the 2006/2007 version."
1,Does not last,TV is 6 years old and the lamp has been replaced 3 times. The picture fades and the color saturation is uneven at best over time. Stay away... Poor product!
5,"Great for those who love taking ""dock walks""","What a super book! It has everything the average sailor could want to know about fiberglass. I have no idea how Bob Perry (one of the editorial reviewers) could read this in one evening. It's just packed with information about most of the American (and some international) sailboat builders, their boats, and in most cases their demise. A lot of ""experts"" at my marina proudly profess knowledge about the histories of the different boats but, after reading this book, I've discovered that many of their stories are not accurate. I you love sailboats and wonder who built them, where they were built, how they were built, and when; then you should get this book. You'll certainly have a better understanding of boat brochures touting the virtues of features like S-glass, Airex cores, and the Scrimp process. And your next marina dock walk to check out other boats will be so much more interesting."
4,Two sides of genius,"This book reveals another side of famed photographer Gordon Parks. He has accompanied arresting photographic shots with poetry -- his own original works. Poetry, it seems, came to him as naturally as his picture taking. It was an innate gift.Parks, born black and the last child of many produced by his sharecropper parents, transcended all the limitations set upon him in his time and place. I suspect he even surprised himself. He was not only a prize-winning photographer, but a poet, musician, film director, and author.This book gives glimpses into his complicated and fascinating soul through combining two forms of his artistic talents."
2,fair to good while it lasted.,"I have had this phone/clock/radio for a few years now and was, at first, happy to have one item replace two on my nightstand. It worked okay at first; though the radio reception wasn't that great, I mainly used it to wake up so that didn't bother me too much. Then the phone became contentious; mostly when calling out, I could hear the person on the other end of the line but they could not hear me. It seems there is not another all-in-one like this so it looks like I will have to buy two items to replace it - when I get around to it."
1,This phone has got a problem!!,I just have to say that exactly the same thing happened to me. After 12 months the phone just stopped working where I could here the person on the other line but they couldn't hear me. Thank goodness Frontgate gave me my money back.
4,Good Clock/Radio but needs some more things.,This GE Telephone it a good thing for people who don't want to wake up at the same time but overall this is a great gift and it overall good. I have never had any problems with GE and love there stuff. The only thing about this is it don't have the greatest sound like my other GE Radio/Clock. They could inhance the sound a little bit. Another thing is there are a lot of buttons that are confusing when you are just waking up. I also push the wrong button when I want to push snoose. But overall this is a great phone and the phone itself it clear and I mean clear. So this is definetly a buyer choice.
1,Why not just call it what it is... an expensive alarm clock!,Have purchased 2 of this particular item. The 2nd one only because I thought the 1st one must have just been defective - a fluke. Seems that they ALL have the same problem. Radio and alarms work fine... phone doesn't work at all. Have researched and spoken with others having the SAME problems with the same unit. GE customer service doesn't seem to care. Their only response was to direct me to authorized repair centers. Guess there's a good reason why they discontinued it!Save your money!...
2,Disappointed,"We recieved the GE bedroom phone a a Christmas gift in 2000.GE products were always thought to have a reasonable service life with us, but this phone has proven what others have said about the decline of the quality in GE's products. We will avoid GE products in the future, and will recommend the same to friends & family."
1,Improperly remixed during restoration,This is not the release you are looking for move along! Move Along!Sound channels are reversed on some songs and on others the stereoization is almost completely gone. They also messed up the arista release as well with flipped sound channels. So unless Lucas ever caves to a re-release hold onto that double LP.
3,Case Break,"The order was shipped on time and arrived soon enough. However the cd case was broken, whether from being shipped or previous accidents I am not sure.The broken case caused a small scratch in the cd, but it doesn't appear to be a problem when listening to it at the moment. However, It could get worse with age."
2,Disappointing,"See other 2-star reviews for particulars as to why this book is disappointing.Instead of purchasing this book, I'd suggest purchasing an old copy of O'Reilly's Unix/Linux in a Nutshell, cutting out the 30-ish pages of the vi chapter, and getting those 30-ish pages covered and bound at Kinko's. This would cost roughly the same amount and would have the advantages of a lie-flat binding and useful, better-organized content."
2,Not very useful,Didn't find much practical info in the reference. You'd probably be better off getting a printout of common commands from the internet and keeping what tricks you've learned and making your own quick reference.
5,"Small Book, Big Help","I use this book as a reference all too often. The authors do a good job at laying this book out, and the secrets of vi are all released in this book. I recommend this book mainly because of it's size. It's small enough to keep on the corner of your desk to reference when you need it."
3,Necessary? Maybe.,"If you use the vi editor often, you won't need this book. If, however, you're like me and use it once in a while to make changes in Linux system files, it can come in handy when you can't remember a command or two.Also, the cover is darn cute! :-)So basically this is a quick reference to the vi editor, with additional chapters covering all the other text-based editors that are based on vi (like vim, for instance)."
2,Fine if you already know vi.,"I didn't find this reference any good UNTIL I knew vi well. It is OK for a quick look up to remember a command; but to learn something new or more than you already know forget it. I have a coffee mug with vi commands on it that is far more helpful. Because of this experience, I am reluctant to buy others in this series (e.g. Python Pocket Reference)."
4,Quite useful.,"A useful companion to ""Learning the vi Editor"" for *nix newbies. (And a handy quick reference for the old hands -- not that many would admit to needing a reference.)"
2,Not Enough Examples,"I had to use vi again after having been out of the UNIX environment for 6 years, so I bought this book for a refresher. It is OK, but there are not enough examples and more than half of the book is dedicated to other flavors of vi (elvis, nvi, vim, and vile). I need to supplement this book with stuff from the web - some of which was more useful than the book. So yes the book is cheap and somewhat useful, but the web is free!"
4,Nicely Done,This is a very nice variety of well known singers doing the songs that we all associate with the great Ella Fitzgerald.
2,GOOD SUBJECT MATTER ON OPERA HOUSES BUT OVERPRICED,"This book is interesting enough in the fact that it features some of the historic opera houses from around the country. However, I believe that the book is overpriced. There are only black and white photos in this paperback book. The paper used is that of average paperback book quality. If you looked at this book not knowing the retail price, I guarantee that anyone would not guess the selling price to be over ... I'd be interested in knowing how a paperback book of this print quality could retail for ... Again, the book is interesting for anyone interested in historic theatres and opera houses but the price is a little steep."
3,Enriquezca su personalidad,Es la segunda vez que ordeno un libro y no me envían exactamente el que pido. El contenido es el similar pero la carátula diferente
5,Does what it's supposed to do.,This step up ring is made in Japan. It's well finished and the threads are clean and accurate. I have a lens with 58mm threads and one with 52mm threads. This ring allows me to use my 58mm polarizer on my 52mm lens. That saved me the cost of a polarizer. It's worth the money.
2,poor quality,spend a few extra dollars and get a better quality ring. threads were rough... you get what you pay for.
5,Handy item!,"There's not much to say about a step-up ring. This one is good quality material - I think it's plastic, but I'm not sure. It screwed onto the lens easily and the filters screw eaasily into it. As my latest lens is the only one I have at 52mm and all my others are 58mm, I just leave it on the lens. That way, I can also use the same lens cap as the others."
1,Defective,"The adapter nearly damaged my $90 polarizer when I tried to fit them together. Either the whole thing is out of round or there is a burr on the 58mm threads that made me worry about trying too hard to screw it onto the polarizer. I didn't even bother attempting to fit it to my lens. Unfortunately it's hardly worth it to return a ~$6 item.Update: I purchased a different brand at a local camera shop, paid the same price, and it threads onto both polarizer and lens smoothly."
2,What could go wrong with a step up ring?,"Well... I bought this a few days before a trip to India w/ my Panasonic GH2. Came the day I was leaving (thanks Prime). An hour before heading to the airport, I went to screw it onto my lens and... it was totally warped! Out of the box! I couldn't get it on, and it looked like it was going to screw up the thread on my lens. Quickly out to the garage and I managed to reshape it (the metal is extremely soft), screw it onto a cheap wide angle adapter (just to keep it straight), then screw it onto the Panny lens, remove the wide angle and screw on my filters. Yeesh. I'll spend some more money next time as it's not worth trashing a lens to save a few bucks on a step up ring."
5,It's a step up ring...,"There's not much to say. It's a step up ring. It's metal. The threads are the right size (i.e. it fits). You screw it onto the lens, and you screw filters onto the ring. I use it so I can share a polarizer between a50mm f/1.8 II(which takes 52mm filters) and the lenses Canon introduced along with theDigital Rebel XSi(18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 ISand55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS, which take 58mm filters). I leave the step-up ring on all the time, and just use a 58mm lens cap instead of the original one."
3,Vague product description,"This is a step up ring to afix a 58mm filter on a 52mm lens. The item description needs to reflect this as it is currently too vague. Luckily, I looked up the item number at the manufacturer's website and found that it is the one I need; otherwise, I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Fit,It was great to find a cap that fits a specific model for my professional camera (for which I had previously mislocated the lid).
1,Who actually wrote this thing?,I have never written a review before but i just had to so others would not feel the same pain. I have read almost all of Coonts other books and bought this with anticipation. What a boring bunch of junk this was. It was obviously wriiten by the co-author and then had Coonts name put on it by the publisher to give it some credibility. Save your money and look elsewhere.
3,Deep Black Returns!,"Once again you have the stars of the NSA(National SecurityAgency,Charlie Dean,Tommy Karr,and Lia DeFrancesca back intoaction. Lia has to first escape Korea before she can join herteammates in France.While the head of NSA Ruebens is battlingfor the security and existance of NSA the team has incovered afrightening consparicy.There is a nuclear weapon missing fromthe French stockpile.After an intense investigation it is foundto be in the possession of an Algerian terrorist.The villain inthis story(the terrorist) intends on exploding the nuclear bomband disrupting the landscape of France.This blast would alterthe coastline and affect the landscape of France.Charlie Deanand the team are also having to deal with a traitor in their ranks as well.You have several exciting scenes at the EiffelTower and the Chunnel.The story has an exciting ending as well."
4,Stephens Coonts Dark Zone,Extremely well written. Very probable plot. Recommend anyone with a desire to read an action packed novel procure a copy and enjoy!
5,Great Read!,Another great read in the Deep Black series. You will not want to put it down until the story is over. Stephen Coonts does not disappoint!
3,Ending endings endings!,"Knowing how to start a book is one thing, figuring out how to end it is another.As a techno thriller it is better than some, but occaisionally an author needs to consider reality. Without putting a spoiler into this review, the ending of this book just couldn't happen and have the good guys survive.Leave the ending aside, I thought this Deep Black installment moved away from the razzle-dazzle (which was good) and left the action to the Deep Black Agents (I wish I could feel something for the characters).This book rolls along pretty well.Will I read another Deep Black, probably. Will I expect a masterpiece - uh-uh."
3,Deep Black: Dark Zone (MP3-CD Unabridged),"I bought this to listen to in the car while I drive but have thus far not had a chance to listen to it yet. However, I did check it out to determine if the MP3 format would play in my car, as I thought CD formats and MP3 formats were interchangeable. However, the MP3 format will not play in my car's CD player, and I am greatly disappointed about this. Consequently, I cannot give an accurate rating to this product at this time."
2,very basic stuff,"If one has never been exposed to green living then this may be the book for you. I found information in this book to be quite basic, quite elementary, in fact, alot of it was plain common sense. The book was hard for me to read through (not a good writing style match for me), but I attempted to because I wanted to find some information I could use. Would not recommend this book for anyone who have had any exposure to green living."
1,J*e M*llard's a wh*re t* put this *out,"If you check for this title under Amazon's list, you will find another listing of this very same release and its 19+ reviews are pretty much the same:THIS IS NOT BADFINGERIT IS POORLY PERFORMEDIT IS NOT WORTH A SINGLE PENNYI am curious if the seller created a new listing to get away from the horrible reaction this release creates.The original cover for this rehash was an animated/drawn face of Joeseph Charles Molland, Sr. It has since taken on a picture of the full band to dupe buyers into thinking it was a legitimate recording. Sounds like a Stan Polley tactic, take sh|t and polish it up and - What do you think? - Does it suddenly change it to something wonderful???"
1,so bad it's incredible,"I thought this was a compilation of the Badfingers greatest hits from their stuio albums.. I was wrong..I just listened to it, ejected it after 30 seconds -- and broke it in half-- do not buy this CD ! You will be sorry, like i am!Amazon did not have a zero star or negative numbers rating system, that is what this deserves.."
3,Shipping Problem,"I ordered this product for my newborn son thinking it was the same type of aspirator the hospital use. The material is soft similar to the hospital's aspirator, but it is not as strong. I was very disappointed in the shipping of this item. I didn't receive the item after I waited for 3 weeks. I finally sent an email and the company said the Post Office didn't deliver the item? Had to wait several more days before receiving the product."
3,"despite the picture, you only get 1 bulb","The bulbs work fine, but I didn't read closely and despite there being a large and small bulb in the photo, you only get one."
2,Not two syringes like picture and description!,"I ordered this item based on the picture -that shows two syringes and the description that says ""syringeS"" -plural. It actually only comes with the large green one. I was hoping I could use it for when my son gets bigger and has a larger nose but needed the smaller one also for right now. The green one doesn't work very well but it does work, so it isn't a total loss. It is better than the Safety First brand that walmart and target carry, those do not work at all. The walls of the bulb part are a little to thin to to spring back out quick enough to form a good suction. My son already likes to play with it and he can squeeze it himself so at worst it is a $4 chewy toy."
1,"Only 1 item, not 2 as shown in image","photo shows 2 items, description does not say just one, but in fact uses plural of syringes -I ordered,expected 2, but only got one bulb syringe"
2,Not enough suction,I was expecting this item to be like the one I was sent home with from the hospital with my baby ... it was not even close! When trying to get suction the bulb doesn't re-inflate ... I don't think the material is thick enough to get the quality suction. It is better than most I have seen and purchased in stores but nowhere near the hospital grade one!
3,It's the closest to the hospital,Its not the one like the hospital which sucks but probably the closest you can get its a bit softer so suction isn't as strong but it still works good.
4,Works well,"Works well, not as big as the one i received in the hospital, but it does the job! It's nice to have a few of these around the house."
5,nose help,i love that the bog bulb is easy to use on by baby and my three year old and it is the same ones that they use in the hospital.
4,Ear/Ulcer Syringe Review,The product works pretty good. I used it for my son's stuffy nose. It actually gets better with use as the rubber becomes softer.
1,broken?,was great for the first use but broke after the second use.ripped at the seams.i've bought 2 of these and this has happened with both of them.
2,"Bought this because of the great reviews, not the same quality as the one you get in the hospital",This does not work as well as the ones you get in the hospital. I have pretty much retired all my syringes and stick with the Nosefrida.
3,"Works ok for toddlers, probably way too large for infants","I've been using this one for a couple of months now (as a nose sucker) and so far it is holding up. Doesn't work very well for getting stuff that's deep in there, though. It is just too large. The smaller one that I bought at the same time as this one works better for that. But this one is still decent. Oh, and I'm currently using it on a 17 month old. It remains to be seen just how long it will actually last before splitting apart, as they all ultimately do."
4,Size,To help you wrap your mind around how big 3 ozs is in a sphere - it's a little smaller than an orange/apple. I was hoping to replace the bulb syringe we got for my daughter at the hospital when she was born but this one is about three times too big. It works - it's just large and in charge. The good thing - I can always find it!
3,Too Large,"This is way too large to use on my 8 month old. It it like the ones from the hospital, but make sure to order a smaller one."
4,Hospital-grade,"This is the same type of bulb syringe (nasal aspirator) that I received from the hospital after delivering my son. This one, however, is larger than the one I was trying to replace. This is a 3 oz. bulb and I belive the one I have is 2 oz. It is too large for my 9 month old, but it should work great when he gets a little older (and bigger)."
2,Surprised,"I am very fond of cooking and baking I enjoy the luxury of having great products in my kitchen to ease the work at hand. I received the J.A. Henckels International block with some different styles of knives. My husband did purchase the block in which I was able to add and build, as you know the J.A. Henckles is quite expensive. After purchasing the ""Boning Knife"", I was not pleased with the sharpeness. The handle was a little smaller than expected ( put it like this my ring size is a 41/2) therefore I do not have a very big hand. I would try the higher end series. I hope this help."
4,Hubby Christmas Gift,I ordered this 5-1/2 boning knife for my husband for Christmas. Last year he got the 7in and can not seem to live without it. I too love the knife for cutting veggies. Nice sharp blade. We do sharpen occationaly. But what knife don't you have to. I am sure he will be very happy once he opens it.
4,Will use in the Spring,"I know most teachers will have their major test for students in the spring. I will use this cd to help my students relax before we take our major tests. Normally I play the same music every year. Hopefully, my students will do well this year on their major tests. This cd did place me in a very relaxing state of mind."
1,"One Word - DRM, another word - JUNK","This product is cool looking. This product is well designed. However, the DRM rules are stupid. It is my music, I should be able to do with it what I want. I do not need to be managed. Their software is HORRID and without it, the device is useless. I have a mini disc player, another cool looking, well designed product which now sits in a drawer because dealing with it is too much of a pain. This is the new mini disc player, the new cool-looking, well-designed pain."
1,"Turn back now, before it's too late","Great piece of hardware. Fatally flawed software, at least for some of us.Before purchasing, try downloading Sony's Sonic Stage from Connect.com. If you can't get that to work, you'll never get this player off the ground. If you can, you have a prayer of a chance, but you'd better be patient.Many more headaches than it's worth, given the outstanding competition."
1,Bad software makes it useless.,"I loved it when I bought it a few months ago, but now the Sonic Stage software won't recognize the player, so I've got a $400 paperweight.Sonic Stage is hands down the worst software I have ever used. An unexpected disappointment from Sony."
2,Great unit...Lousy software,"First of all, let me just say that prior to purchasing this player I was seriously considering getting a mini ipod. After scrutenizing both players, I ended up with this player simply because of the ff. reasons:1. I like the metal casing w/c I think is really cool. Nowadays most electronics are made out of plastic. No fading colors here.2. 20gb baby.. (had to shell out an extra $150 for 16Gb.) more memory = more songs...(duh)3. Battery life 30 hrs? sweeeet!!!Now, why I returned it:1. Sonicstage... the v2.o that came with it SUCKS!!! crashes all the time..just downloaded the v2.2 and...hold on, wait..yep, still SUCKS!!!2. Sonicstage... never really mind converting my mp3's to atrac but now sonicstage won't recognize my driver.. this SUCKS!!3. SONICSTAGE!!!.. now i can't directly transfer my cd's to atrac.. TOTAllY SUCKS!!!GREAT UNIT!!! LOUSY SOFTWARE!!!"
2,this is not mp3 player,"this is not mp3 player, this is atrac3 player and you can load tracks with only sonicstage. good device, bad software. device is user friendly but sonicstage .....:(i really disapointed for buying this sony product just because of sonicstage and atrac3 format.these kind of players should be suitable for all formats, not special one for sony or sthelse."
3,Good player,"Its a good player, durable I dropped it a couple of times while playing and it works just fine, the only problem I have with it is the shuffel, after like 10 songs or so it starts back up to the 2nd song of the shuffel and keeps doing it, even if you start with a different song, it cycles then ends back up to the 2nd start song again, thats the most annoying thing I have with this unit."
5,It's like MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE in Italian.,"I bought this book for my daughter for a school report on Prohibition. I could not put it down. This book is fast-paced and extremely funny. It shows the warmly human side of these happy-go-lucky Italians as they break into the illegal wine business through a series of Sting-like raids on other people's illegal wine .I loved the incident where they stored a few thousand gallons of red wine in the farm's water tank temporarily. When they returned to the farm, all their friends were having a party. They had hot and cold running wine from the kitchen tap! A gift from God!You'll be telling people about this book."
5,The Best Melodic Emo Band From San Diego Ever,"(...), this album is awesome and highly recommended. Its melodic enough for the songs to stick in your head but there's also heavier guitars and well, its just yummy. And the vocals of course are really good too. This is the former singer of Connecticut hardcore band Sum of All Fears. If you like The Get Up Kids or any bigger bands like them I recommend Counterfit to you. They're recording a full length in December 2001 so look out for that too!"
4,Errors.,"The collection is very interesting, in that one gets a sense of Zizek's theoretical perspective and methodological tendencies across a range of texts. It also forces one to reconsider Lacan's work. Unfortunately, the book itself is riddled with typographical errors. The publisher should be thoroughly embarrassed by this."
3,Doesn't Transpose Midi/Tiff Files too Well,"I'm doing the 30 day free trial too, anyway, I'm studying vocals (singing different types of songs) and I wanted to be able to edit the music (change notes around, lengthen them, and then hear them played--and this program does that).But when I started opening a midi file to take a look at, listen to and edit for my own singing, it doesn't do that too well. Notes are missing and when it plays it squeeks some notes out.So, I tried it with a Tiff File, same thing.I then tried starting a new, blank sheet music and copying and filling in the notes, but for some reason the selection, copy keys don't seem to work. Maybe it's me, maybe you'll have better luck with it, maybe I'll try it again, but for now I'm trying out Notation ComposerNotation Composer by Notation Software, so hopefully that works out better."
4,Great,Excellent to learn how to draw human figure in all its postures. Would recommend it for animators and artists of all kinds
4,The Time Machine - Alan Parsons,"I have been an Alan Parsons fan since 1979 when the album Eve was released. Great work. Great music. Great themes. I bought the Japanese release album because I wanted Beginnings. Out of the Blue is perhaps the best song in the album, but Ignorance is Bliss and The Very Last Time are very good as well."
1,Hollow? No Point?,"I've read the good reviews. I've read the book. I can't reconcile the two. It's nicely desribed, but the whole book is slim and rather unremarkable, without much intrigue, and even less suspense. I've been to Brooklyn a couple of times, and it does capture some of the sights and sounds."
2,Hard to wade through to the end,"I am not a typical book reviewer, but am an avid reader of mystery and crime novels. There are plenty of reviews to let you know the essence of the plot, which I found to be quite weak. I found the writing style verbose. I also found the book to be very repetitious."
5,A book about redemption,"I picked up this book on tape at the library for a quickie read) to listen to while passing the time doing mundane household chores. What a nice surprise to find this multi-layered novel interwoven with human condition and survival in difficult circumstances. I found the story compelling and the characters flawed and interesting (always a plus). In the end the tale is all about the chance for redemption...of ourselves and others, often occuring at the same moment. I thought it was a bittersweet novel, beautifully written and well worth the time it would take you to read or listen to."
2,A good sleeping sedative!,"Look up ""hyperbole"" in the Oxford English dictionary and adjacent to it you will find ""Hollowpoint"". I found Reuland's language pretentious at best, cumbersome at worst.Once i waded through the opening chapters and emerged at the other side, i was a weaker version of my former self. I even got the distinct impression that Reuland himself got fed-up, as soon the language changed to a more familiar one...English!I would give the book 1 star, but its one saving grace was when it ended!Avoid...unless you suffer from insomnia!"
5,Gripping,Please see my review of Reuland's Semiautomatic. Everything I said there applies here. Both are great and gripping page-turners.
5,Fantastic!,"This is a remarkable journey thru Gio's mind as he reconciles the terrible tragedy from his own life with the tragedy he sees every day on the streets of Brooklyn. For those readers who prefer a complicated plot with lots of twists, there might be only disappointment with this novel. But for those who are interested in getting inside the mind of a man who can't quit, can't go on, and can't forgive himself, this is a fantastic read."
3,Caveat Emptor,"This is a well-written novel about crime, but not a novel that meets the expectations of those seeking 'crime fiction.' This is art fiction, short on incident, long on characterization. While it held my attention it was not in any way suspenseful. Nor was it comic. Something bad has happened to a good man. We eventually learn the mundane but still shattering details. In the meantime he is working on another case which ultimately elucidates his own situation. That's about it, along with some reflections on Brooklyn which are nicely done. This is not, however, a heavily textured reflection on place of the sort associated with a master like James Lee Burke. While the Brooklyn portrayed is darker than Jonathan Lethem's it is not so fully realized as to be a central presence in its own right. My guess is that readers of art fiction are generally not readers of crime fiction and the former may have taken this novel to be the sort of thing read by the latter. It isn't, but it's well done."
5,Exceeded Expectations,"Hard to believe a discount of this magnitude but absolutely true. The gorgeous Italian white leather case is worth the price alone. Some trepidation about buying sunglasses sight unseen, but fortunately, fit my face well. I should have bought a few more, such a deal! Very happy."
2,"No DSL support, are you kidding me?","Yeah so maybe DSL doesn't compare to cable but I am not the only person in the world who has it. The fact that this game works fine with cable AND dial-up but not DSL is mind boggling. Worse, it doesn't even state the incompatibility on the back of the game or anywhere in the manual. After spending an hour trying to get it to work I finally spent a few bucks and called the tech support line only to find out it DSL is not supported. How come DSL works fine in Tiger Woods 2004 and not 2005? Ah, screw it, I'm done ?#@?! about it. My final answer is, ""Boycott this game and save your money""."
1,Great game!!,"This game is great!!! Game face has new feauters which are also great. The only thing i was disapointed about was the seletion of golfers. But dont let that stop you. The golf swing is kind of hard at first but once you start playing for a while it gets easy. yes, you do have to swing with the left analog stick. Overall i give this game a 4.5."
1,Tiger woods 2005,"As a novice to PC2 games I find this to be really difficult to get to grips with the on line tutorial does not give you tips when shots dont work out, just repeats the same instructions over and over, I also find all the different options very annoying as I just want to play a game and improve, many of these options would be better under an advanced button."
1,Tiger Woods 2005,"Not a good game at all, I bought used and i don't have a memory card so everytime i finish the lessons i can't unlock the tour mode after i had finished the lessons, don't wast your money on 2005, not worth it.Very STRESSFULL.I give it an F rating for ps2"
5,best EA Sports game ever!,Tiger Woods 2005 is the best game I have ever played. You play against legends and they can challenge you at your own home fairway. This game has Tiger vision and it's awesome. I have 2003 and 2004 and I would say this one is the best.
4,One of the best golf games...,"I'm a big golf fan. Hot Shots Golf is probably one of my favorite gaming series when it comes to golf. This years Tiger brings a little more than usual. An advanced swinging system, sharper graphics, a very nice soundtrack from BT, and more fun than you can shake a club at! Some of the holes on this game can get very difficult. You can design your own challenging courses. Probably the best addition to this version of PGA Tour is the create-a-golfer. It has the most advanced, to-the-detail create-a-player I have ever seen in a video game.The fun factor is a 5-star. But the overall rating is a 4-star. Because some of the elements of the game I just don't agree with. The courses are amazing, but they seem to be ""bland"". Meaning kind of repetitive (background/nature wise).Pick this game up now. Or at least rent it. You won't be let down."
4,Double Eagle in my very first round,"I got a double eagle in my first round ever. In my first round of Tee Off on the Dreamcast I got my only hole in one ever. Guess it's beginner's luck. The graphics are weird when the ball is in mid-air, it always lands shorter than it seems it should land. It's weird swinigng with the analog stick, but I'll get used to it."
5,aaawwwsssooommmeee!!!,This game is amazing u can create yourself exactly like yourself with the new gameface2. You can play with the legends such as Jack Nichalous Arnold Palmer and Gary Player among others to. There is fourteen beautiful courses. EA Sports really came through in this one. If you don't have it don't rent it. Buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Lots of FUN!!,"I've played this game for years then lost it and had to buy it again. Even with new versions out, I STILL PREFER this version of Tiger Woods over ANY NEWER VERSION. The newer versions make it difficult to putt. This version (2005), the putting is easy to follow, but still challeging. Fun for everyone, my girl & I play each other all the time since you don't have to be a big fan of golf to enjoy. IT'S the BEST TIGER WOODS VERSION AROUND!!"
5,BEST GOLF GAME OUT THERE. EVEN COMPARED TO THE NEWEST ONES!,"The 05 series is by far the most fun, entertaining, and easy to play golf game on the market. I have played the newer Tiger Woods series and found them to be more difficult and BORING. Even now in 2008 this game is STILL one of my top 3 most played games on ps2!! Its just realistic and FUN!"
5,Tiger Woods 2005 is awesome!,"I got this game yesterday and its great so far. I love the fact that you can choose which season (winter, spring, summer, and fall) you can play in. The color of the leaves on the trees in the fall is great. Also, you can tee off at anytime in the day or night. It keeps track of the time as your playing your round. You can even play at midnight under the stars and moon. Its great. I love playing Edgewood in Tahoe. The scenery is great. This is a great game."
5,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005,LOTS OF FUN PERIOD. Dont like the setup for swings. like the putting (feet and inches). Don't know which other years are setup like this . can u help?
4,Perfect!,"I absolutely love this bridge! It was just a tad taller than the original, but that made it easier for me to play it. Easily installed, functional, and inexpensive. What more could an intermediate player ask for?"
4,Great book,"All aspects of making dinosaur models are described in this book. Construction, painting and making display bases. Vinyl, resin and plastic kits are discussed, along with converting and detailing them.Well written and informative text is accompanied by many photos and an occasional drawing. Basics are covered first, more advanced topics are introduced later. This makes the book interesting to intermediate or even advanced modeler, while being accessible to a beginner.The only thing that would make the book better would be color photographs. Gallery section in the middle of the book is in fact printed in color, but majority of photos are B&W; - that's the only reason why I gave the book 4 stars. My copy was printed 10 years ago, but it stood very well to passage of time. Highly recommended."
4,"Great light, weird colored electrical wire","This light was as shown on the website. I love the light. We purchased the antique brass option and that looks great everywhere except for the choice of electrical wire the company used. The wire was a bright yellow gold, and I wasn't convinced it was going to ""age"" to an antique brass color. We went to Home Depot, and we found that there is an antique brass colored wire that could have been used. We were hanging this from a 13' ceiling, so there would be lots of wire showing, and we didn't want to do it twice. We rewired it with the correct colored wire."
2,100 PARTS AND ALOT OF SPRINGS AND NO MAG DESINGE,"Dont bother buying this book it,s far too technical for anyone except a pro with a flash machine shop 100 parts (some tiny) heaps of springs and no mag"
1,smg,"what are you going to do with that? the weapon is cool, but it is made for detroying people. so, you can sell it to the army and you can get $."
5,grate,thes is for the more advanced home gunsmitherlath rekuaierd but exelent gun for the clandestine mass production uses availebul sten mags
3,To other reviewers:,"I'm laughing out loud at reviews of this book complaining that ""unless you are a machinist"" it isn't very helpful. IF YOU ARE NOT A MACHINIST YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS TRYING TO BUILD A SUB MACHINE GUN AT HOME. I have to say I LOVE IT that you apparently thought you were going to buy this book, slap a few pieces of metal together and end up with a working firearm... A full auto pistol no less."
3,more complex than it needs to be,"he has great ideas for mass underground production. other than that there are lots of usefull ideas, but better guns can be made with less work."
3,Needs some work,"Although this book contains a wealth of information, the drawing package itself contains a lot of errors. There are numerous missing dimensions and virtually no dimensional tolerancing. None the less I proceeded to create three dimensional models in accordance with the authors drawings. The analysis of the completed model revealed a several positioning errors and dimensions that neededed to be tweaked. All this said, an invaluable piece of work."
2,SUBpar,This so primitive. As a machinist it would work but the average Joe would have a difficult time being successful.
1,Angry plus dissapointment,"After buying and reading the book I realized that I need a lathe to make the gun. Lost my money! I think that the author should let the visitors know about that ""little fact"" before buying the book."
3,excellent technically BUT........,"The technical drawings in this book are of a high standard and anyone who has experience and/or access to a machine-shop will find them an excellent reference to this kind of work. One notable exclusion however is that the author only passingly describes the process of barrel rifling and suggests that the reader purchase another of his books in which this subject is dealt with in detail. With this in mind perhaps the title should be ""A...very inaccurate unless you buy another book as well Submachine Gun...etc""! Other than that it is excellent reference material."
4,Clean and Clear,I have been looking for this CD for awhile and am happy to have found a clean and clear version of the music. This is exactly what I wanted and expected. Enjoy
3,Keep your finger on the volume control,"Like the reviewer from Singapore, I vote for the Jochum version on DG. It has considerably more energy and panache. Even so, Mata's recording would be entirely acceptable except for the dynamic range. The variation between the loudest and softest passages is so wide that I find it difficult to set the volume acceptably. If you want to hear the softest passages, the loudest will be audible in the next county. Or, you can play engineer and adjust the volume on the fly."
4,Nice complement,"I was looking for a fresh but classy addition to my coffee table collection that now consists of ONLY Marc Baptiste's 'Beautiful'. Therefore, I was very discriminating about the runner-up. I was looking for another book that contained erotica, but did not want to push the envelope into an area of tackiness. However, Rundu's studio photography, mixed with a tasteful collection of spontaneous location pictures, offer a nice complement to my 'green' collection of eclectic coffee table books."
5,Very Well Done,Black Love is Long overdue too Be Viewed with Class&Style.this Book Hits Home.Very Solid Pictures&Poems that set the tone really well.I wish The FIlm Business would Show this more often&TV as well.Very essential.
2,Alfred's Pro Audio Series,"I was expecting much better from this DVD. The into showed promise, but the actual content was just meandering, unstructured conversations. No church sound specific content. I recommend Live Audio Basics as a solid alternative, worked well for our church."
5,Ideal Men in an Ideal World,"Carlquist photographs men the way nature intended them to be, uncut and naked in the great outdoors. Natural Man is a visual delight."
2,"Could be better, could be worse","gets the job done, matches my UpStage.. doesn't stay in the ear too well, falls out more than it stays in. i find myself holding it into my ear while using it, which kind of defeats the purpose of handsfree."
2,bluetooth,"talking on it sounds like you are far away my phone customers say. Very small, can be awkward to keep in ear"
3,It's ok...,"Performance was pretty good, but I was unable to get it to stay in my ear for more than a couple of minutes at a time. While talking, it would work its way loose and fall out. It is small and difficult to find when it falls out while driving down the road. No real complaint about the performance though, at least while it was in my ear. Price wasn't bad, in fact, it was pretty cheap on price. All in all, not a bad purchase."
3,Great Technology - Bad Design,"The technology is good. Clear sound, stays charged forever, handy charging station. PROBLEM it does not stay in your ear without the clip thing, and that thing breaks. I bought my bluetooth in December, I have been through 5 clips since then! If samsung made a metal clip, I could give this set 5 stars."
4,LOVED THE COLOR and it's pretty decent!,"Big fan of RED, and wanted a smaller bluetooth that didn't have to hook over my ear. Saw the plug and figured, why not! I found it easy to use and I preferred it over the ones I was using previously. One thing however, the battery life isn't long if you're yacking away with your friends."
1,Samsung WEP 200 earclip,"The plastic earclip that comes with the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset is JUNK! We have 2 headsets and within 12 days, or 2-3 uses apiece, BOTH earclips broke! Production flaw? Absolutely !The earclip is absolutely necessary if you use this headset like we do. At $1.99 each, it would cost us $450-$500 a year to replace the earclips! Production flaw? Oh, yeah!"
4,Great Earpiece,"The WEP200 is a great earpiece. My family is very hard on earpieces and we've broken units from several manufacturers including Bluespoon, Logitech, Motorola, Plantronics and Scala. After my wife's Plantronics earpiece died from a quick dip in a puddle, I started looking for a replacement. The Samsung was on sale and had decent ratings, so I thought I'd give it a try. After she'd had hers for a few months, I bought the red one for myself.Pros:It's very small and light.The case is pretty well sealed -- the charging contacts are metal strips not a plug, so the only hole is for the microphone.The sound quality is excellent (tried with Sony-Ericsson W600i and Cingular 8525/HTC Tytn).Stable (no random disconnects, power-offs, etc)Good battery lifeCons:The included rubber ear loops aren't easy to use. With enough fiddling, we got them to hold the unit securely, though. Jabra ear gels work as replacements, but the unit won't fit in the charger with the gel attached."
4,Humming Bird Feeder Tubes,I am crafting my own hummingbird feeders out of recycled bottles using red beads and wire.The tubes fit perfectly.My only challenge is mixing the sugar solution for the hummingbirds yo like.
5,wonderful tubes,I used some small bottles I had painted and wires and they worked like a charm. The birds seem to like it anyway.
5,Happy to find replacements,With most hummingbird feeders you can't find part replacements and have to end up buy a whole new feeder. I lone the fact you can also use these for just about any bottle to make your own feeder! Very happy with the price for all the tubes I received!! I can't wait to use my imagination on making my own feeders. : )
2,There is no way to keep liquid from leaking,There is nothing in the tube to keep the liquid in the feeder from leaking out. Don't waste your money on this product.
3,"Feeder Tubes, leaky!","I made some decorative hummingbird feeders and needed these to complete the project. While the stopper worked well at staying in the feeder, I found that the hummingbird nectar dripped constantly out the tip of the tube, attracting ants under the feeder and a sticky mess below."
2,These are a disappointment.,"I thought that making hummingbird feeders would be a lot of fun. I made several using these feeder tubes, and most of them didn't work very well. I just couldn't make my designs work. The hummingbirds were interested, but they couldn't drink from the feeders."
4,functional,These items should help me create my own hummingbird feeders. Quality seems adequate. Now to test my own designs and get away from traditional feeders
3,Sugar water leaks out.,"Sugar water drips out, even with a ball bearing. I think something else needs to be placed inside the tube so that the water won't leak out so fast."
1,They leak!,Maybe my bottle isn't the right size but I've tried several different ones. The nozzle leaks a steady drop. A half cup of nectar was gone in about an hour. I was very disappointed in these.
3,hummingbird feeder tubes,this is product is ok. but when you put it on the bottle and fill it with the liquid it leaks out.
1,Constantly leaked to the extentent that solution poured out! Returning,I used this for a glass feeder in which the other tube had broken as well as my own homemade feeder. Both leaked horribly. The tube will fill up with solution and then the slightest movement (wind) will cause all the solution in the tube to come pouring out. There is no ball bearing inside to keep the solution from pouring out. I am returning these. Don't waste your money!
2,did not work,bought a pkg of these to use on some homemade and boughten feeders. The tubes fit but the juice went all the way out on most-dripped steady and did not stop until empty. Some just dripped out slowly losing the liquid in a day or two.You can't feed a bird with no food. I am back to where I started- looking for a alternative to use my feeders
3,Nice quality.,"The quality of this product is nice, however would have been nice to have a selection of the size of the cork which was purchased. No size was listed when it was purchased and if I knew that larger corks were avaialbe I would have purchased those as well....... thx. dar"
1,They leak!!!!! BAD,they leak I make hummingbird feeders out of my stained glass and all 12 of them leak!!!!!! now I am faced with the task of finding replacement and making my customers happy! dont waist your money they will leak on you and it is worth it to look for some other parts for your feeders
1,hummingbird feeder tubes do not work don't buy,I bought these hummingbird feeder tubes to finish a project making feeders from wine bottles. They leak and drip constantly and the cork pops out it is not much fun to have sticky hummingbird food all over you!
1,leak,"These do not work at all, very disappointing. no matter what I use them in they leak very badly, all the nectar leaks out with in 15 minutes."
2,Drip Drop Drip Drop Drip Drop,I fit the tube as tight as possible in the glass bottle filled with nectar and then turned it upside down. Several drops of the nectar leaked out initially and then a slow drip developed even in a slight breeze. All nectar will leak out after a few days and the ants on the ground will love you for it. I took a chance based on the other negative reviews. Wished I would have listened and not ordered these. Bad move on my part!
3,Feeder Tubes,"The tips of the tube are too large, and they continue to leak. The manufacture should correct this problem before offering it for sale. I guess like every defective product offered to the consumer in our country, the tubes are manufactured in China!!!! Finding anything made in the USA is almost non-existent......."
5,hummingbird feeder stoppers,I'm very happy with the hummingbird feeder stoppers that I purchased. I repurpose bottles of different sorts into hummingbird feeders and sell them at art fairs and shows. Thanks for the great deals I get from shopping this site.
2,humming bird feeder tubes,Very excited to find these since i was making my own hummingbird feeders. Very disappointed when i found out they leaked constantly. We even tried a BB in the tube and it still didn't work. :-( any suggestions where i can find ones that don't leak?
4,hummingbird feeder stoppers,Were what I was looking for and couldn't find anywhere else. They appear to do the job and I'm satisfied. Will probably be placing another order shortly.
1,Feeder Tubes for Hummingbird Feeders,"I was excited to get these to make a lot of feeders out of bottles, both glass and plastic. No matter what I tried, the water would just drip and drip and drip until the bottle was empty. 12 out of 12 feeder tubes leaked, and didn't work at all. This purchase was a complete bust."
1,blowin' yer nose!,"Apparently there is no end to corporate avarice... Sony Music currently has four(!) different Van Morrison titles in print featuring this same material (Blowin' Your Mind, TB Sheets, Bang Masters, and this). Without even considering that this is hardly his most memorable work (apart from ""Brown-Eyed Girl""), that is a ridiculous number. Bang Masters is the best of the lot... this is the worst. For adventurous souls, there are also a number of import collections availible (Payin' Dues, Brown-Eyed Beginnings, New York Sessions) that feature a bizarre second disc of ""demos"" recorded as contract fulfillment (reportedly in about an hour) after Bert Berns' untimely death."
1,Not a real Van Morrison album,"This disc came about because Morrison was changing labels and was forced to produce some songs to meet a contractual obligation. Most are throw-aways, I own every Van Morrison CD ever released officially and dozens of others. Buy ANY of them before this one. He's a great artist; this is a crummy CD."
4,Review,"Worked great. Bought it for a Zombies v. Humans game at my school, since I hate Nerf guns. Good speed and level up to 10 feet. Not what I need for charging zombies from my dorm, but it helped me survive for a few days."
2,Broke after one day,"The crossbow shot the suction cup darts very nicely - they stuck well on wooden doors and cabinets.However, within 24 hours, the rope on the crossbow frayed and snapped.The toy was useless within 24 hours. We were left with a very sad third grader."
2,Uh uh. Afraid not.,"Moisturizing lotion - yes. Did it help with the stubble? No. Now, i'm no sasquatch but i am a brunette. As directed, i used this stuff for a couple weeks. Nothing. Then i kept it up for the month. Nada. My leg hair hadn't softened or thinned or anything.Pass it up, ladies. Just keep shaving."
2,"Ok, but not as good as other books on Abs.","Everybody wants flatter, firmer Abs. This book does provide good information, but not what I was expecting. The excerises are tiring and if you're not careful, you'll end up sore. I asked my personal trainer about this book and he did not recommend it. Instead he recommended ""six pack Abs"", I've already read it and I loved it!. He also recommended ""Awesome Abs"". I already ordered it I can't wait to receive it. As for this book, It's ok. I don't think it targets the right areas. but some of the infrmation provided here are not all bad either."
1,Not as good as new books.,"I read this book and was very disappointed. After doing the excerises mentioned in this book, you'll end up feeling sore, not only from your stomach, but you're back will hurt. I didn't really see any results after 2 months of everyday exercising because I didn't feel it was targeting all the stomach area. I just finished reading a much better book called ""3-minute Ab's"". It was much easier to understand, the exercies are eaiser to perform and the only thing that is sore after your abdominal exercise is your stomach(not your back). I have been doing the exercises to this new book for only four weeks and I can see the results already. The best thing is, this book targets the sides of your stomach too, not just the middle."
1,Boring,"I fell asleep about 10 minutes into the video. Started out okay but, lost interest. Needed more substance about Auschwitz."
4,Very good product,"This product is sturdy and is advertised. Definitely glad I bought this, even though I would rather have full range of motion it works as well as any door mounted bar could."
1,Risk of Cancer???,"Stamina Doorway Trainer Plus (Black, Chrome)On the Amazon website, it doesn't say, ""This product contains a chemical known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" This is printed on the Owner's Manual, so I didn't know about this until receiving and opening the box. Is Amazon potentially liable for health risks by continuing to market this product without giving buyers this information up front?"
2,Useful Latin Phrases,Useful phrases to have to hand lest you might be accosted on your way to the Forum. If you get 2 or 3 phrases then it is worth it. Useful reference book.
2,Quit dispensing after only several uses,This caraffe lives up to it's reputation for keeping liquids hot for a long time. Beware if you have problems with the lid assembly though. I only used the pot 3 or 4 times in the last year and it has quit dispensing liquid! On speaking with customer service at Zojirushi I was told I must have a bad lid assembly and I will need a new one. That part is not covered at all under warranty - my pot is less than one year old - so I will have to pay the $23 with shipping for a new lid. I don't know how often this problem comes up but it is expensive when it does.
4,bought it because the Japanese use it for hot tea; could be better,I'm in the market again for my second one; however if it was GREAT; I'd order another one now; Since it's not totally great I'll try another brand and do my own A-B comparison.The Zojirushi has the name and it's Japanese. (they use it for hot tea) of course..can't push the button.
3,"Okay-ish, looks good, pumps well, don't hold temp all that good","It pumps good and holds a lot. I like it but I think I'd prefer one with glass in the inside because this one does not hold the temperature well. I read all of the other reviews and they said that it kept things warm; that's why I bought this model. Well the other reviewers, I don't know what they are doing, but it doesn't stay that warm for very long. I had coffee in there and pretty much over night it was cold. I wasn't expecting it to stay warm but I thought it would do better than that."
5,Retains heat in the cold outdoors!,"Recently, I took some coffee to sell at an outdoor farmer's market. Quite simply, this airpot did a great job of keeping the coffee hot enough to keep the customers happy. The outdoor temperature was in the upper 30s to lower 40s, and we were there for 2 and a half hours. At the end of that time, with about half the coffee still remaining, the coffee was still at the right temperature for serving.To be fair, I also took the time to preheat the airpot with near-boiling water before I brewed coffee directly into the pot. I would generally recommend this practice for any airpot. However, even with preheating, some airpots won't do well in a couple hours of winter weather. The Zojirushi, though, was excellent."
2,Not a Fan,"I have had this grill for a few years and used it yesterday for the first time this season. Every time I use this grill I remember why I hate it. It is not super portable- it's fairly heavy, awkward to carry and the wheels aren't useful. Standing up the grill for use and then collapsing it after use is awkward- you can't see what you're doing and, again, it is fairly heavy. The worst part of this grill is cleaning it. If I cook on the grill for 20 minutes it takes me at least that long to clean it and it is always a mess. I would rather use a lil' smokey grill- much more portable and easier to clean."
1,Melted,First time used the handle just melted off. Came close to getting melted plastic on me. Dangerous.
1,Pass on this!,Handle melted when first used. My fault didn't read caution on placard. (You can't cook with the grill cover down which in turn creates longer cook time and more gas useage.Wheel bent and can't be removed.Meat sticks to grill.Requires much cleaning for small use.Pressure regulator stuck and flames melted front panel before I could turn off gas.Grill is now in a dumpster!
1,Pinnacle of Engineering Stupidity,"This grill shows just how little Coleman engineers actually use the equipment they design. The top's locking mechanism is idiotic, when you fold it up to transport it, and lift the handle to move it, the lock pin falls into the open position so the grates fall out of it. So, unless you like a little grit in your burgers, you have to carry the stupid thing, which defeats the whole purpose of it having wheels. Another disadvantage with that lock pin, it's not only put on backwards, it's so cheap, that even laying flat in trunk, it comes undone, and the grates hop halfway out, and the cheap tin top will smash itself out of shape on the grates. I got three uses out of this grill, and I'm throwing it away. I could've taken the wife out for lobster dinner three times, and had money left over, had I not wasted it on something with Coleman's name on it. I'll be buying a Weber next time."
2,"grill is just ok, not recommended","cons:recently purchased this grill for travel softball team. somewhat awkward to set up, you must stand on pull handle then pull up grill to standing position. grill lid comes unlocked when pulling and grates fall out. food sticks to grilling surfaces use pam for grilling anything. hard to clean grilling surfaces, its not easy to clean under the grate surfaces either. grease drip pan is plastic and the grease caught fire and the plastic pan burned completely.pros:folds to a small size, fits in car nicely. the two burners are good, can cook at 2-different temperature settings."
4,Great for apartment balcony,After much research and after throwing away the little table top metal canister grill I ordered this and I've been happy with it. EASY to assemble although it is heavy to get it up stairs. Gets very hot so you have to adjust your cooking time. No problem cooking w/ top down which is good as flame will blow out if it is windy. As long as you clean the grates while it is still hot you don't have to take them off each time and scrub them. I would recommend this grill and this is a great price as I saw it at Dick's Sporting Goods store for a lot more money.
4,The size is bigger than I expected,The shape and usage is good.but this is bigger than I expected.I thought it as half size.It is difficult to move my wife alone.
2,Burns too hot even on low,"I like the portability of this grill and the availability of different attachments, but this grill simply burns too hot even on the lowest setting. Food that is high in fat like chicken or foods that are delicate like salmon, or small like kabobs get scorched within 60 seconds on this grill. Either thick steaks or indirect heating is all that it is good for. If I keep one burner off and use the other on medium, the cooking time seems to match a larger grill, but then the grilled flavor is also diminished with indirect cooking. The gas canisters seem to last long, which is another good feature.In summary, while I won't dump this grill and get a different one (cost prohibitive), I will not buy the same brand when it comes time for replacement."
2,Grate broke,This bbq was great until I went to clean the grill grate and it was cracked after only two uses a day apart. Very dissappointed.
4,Coleman Road Trip Grill,"I searched around for a portable red grill for months and decided to buy this one. It was small enough to be portable and big enough to be useful. The propane canister that attaches is a good size for useful/portable scenario as well. The attached side trays are quite helpful when I'm tailgating and have less table space. The one thing that is a bit of a bummer is the clean up... Ugh! It's kind of a big job. I'm not an avid BBQer, so maybe this is par for the course, but it's more work than I would like to deal with. P.S. It's looks great with my other Stanford gear :)"
4,Completely satisfied!,"This is a very well designed grill! I wanted something that could stand on it's own and still be portable - there are very few out there, most are tabletop grills. I found this grill to be very well made and sturdy. It's very frugal with gas consumption! Only 1 minor complaint: The low burner setting is still a little too hot. I wish it could go lower."
1,Don't buy this grill,"I thought this would be a great grill.. large enough to actually cook on, but still portable.I have had mine for a year and a half.. the inside of the cooking area that started out as a reflective metallic is total RUST (it was never left outside or in the rain). The coating on the grates chip easily and then rust forms on the grates.If you use a cleaner and get it on the piazzo starters, they will not work again."
2,Would be nice if you could close it,"I enjoyed using this grill over Father's day and thought it was great. I then tried to move it, however, and found that I can not latch the lid closed if the grates are in the stove, so I have to remove the grates each time I want to move or store the grill. This was a pain while camping since the grates were a mess, and I did not want to take them out until I got home (or pack them in the car while they were greasy).My friend's LXE does not have this problem, but when I called Coleman, they informed me that this is as designed, and it should not latch if the grates are in place."
5,The best mini-grill ever!,Got this as an apartment warming gift for my sister. Cooked a Tri-tip that day and came out great. Small size fits the patio well.
4,road trip grill LXE,Upgrade from my previous coleman grill. Like the cart with wheels feature. Easy to assemble and ready to grill in 15 minutes. Had some problem with shipping. One of the control knobs was broken and the lid latch was also broken.
4,Very Happy!!!,"So far so good. I've only used the grill once, but love it. The only problem was cleaning the actual grilling surface. Other than that, no complaints!!"
5,Portable Grill,Coleman 9949-750 Road Trip Grill LXE (Red)Given as a gift...good quality and good food.
4,Better than good,"Took the grill camping the day that it was delivered, and the grill did everything that I needed...it cooked the food. It's a bit larger than I expected (that's no problem). The grills don't heat up very evenly, so it can be a bit of a challenge to cook food evenly. I did cook w/ the lid closed (only on low heat) and checked the grill frequently and had no problems. I'd like to be able to take the grill off of the stand & place it on a table to cook. I'd also like the handle to be extendable (i'm 6'-1"" and pulling it behind me is awkward). We used it for cooking dinner at night, and toasted bagels for breakfast...it's versitile, even without the optional griddle & stove-top options which I plan to buy in the future.I wouldn't suggest buying this to be your main BBQ grill at home if you grill often.I'm glad that I bought it."
4,Perfect for tailgating,"This little grill is stylish, lightwieght, and most importantly, cooks well! It actually works almost too well in this capacity. Cooking food with the burners on high is a tricky proposition as you can completely blacken a brat in just a few minutes.The folding-rolling design is great though, and I just can't wait for football season to begin for the tailgaiting. One little can of propane will power this puppy all afternoon, and can cook up an absurd amount of meat.Highly recommended, just remember to be careful on high."
4,Good but not so Good,I love the ease of using and carrying around. Clean up is awful. I hate it. So I just put aluminum foil down to cook on to minimize the mess. Well worth the $$
5,Love it!,"We take it camping and I don't find it hard to clean as previously stated. We are tent campers and usually our dish water is cold unless I take the time to heat it up over the fire. After the grill cools down I usually spray it with a little 409, wipe off what I can with a paper towel, then put it in my dish pan of soapy water. The rest comes off pretty easy. If you are tailgating you could spray it with the 409, tuck it in a garbage bag, and clean it at home. There could be a problem if you cook on it several times in a row without cleaning or don't do anything until you get home. It cooks great. We don't have the griddle attachment but are thinking of getting it. Happy camping/tailgating!"
5,Awesome!,"We haven't had the chance to use it a whole lot, but every time we do it cooks quickly and evenly. I love all of the interchangeable tops for it too!"
4,It does the job and it is very manageable.,"I love the grill. I do not have a big area for outdoor cooking. It is the perfect size and it has the capabilities to do anything a big grill would do and it is very easy to keep clean. The only complaint I have is that even at a low setting it still cooks a little too fast for my taste but other than that, it is great. The additional accessories available for purchase, made it even more appealing and versatile."
5,Exactly what I expected,Our friends had this when we went camping this last summer and my husband really liked it. I now have to buy all the accessories that are made for it.
4,Grill,Works as advertised cooked burgers and hot dogs on it's trial run no issues other than this thing does get hot when it is on. I couldn't let the grill cycle the recommended 15 mins on high as i was afraid the top was going to melt due to all the heat this thing puts off. It seriously get's hotter than my gas oven in my house i could never see cooking on high i kept it on low the whole time and it cooked really fast and even.
4,Perfect for tailgate,Easy to set up we do a broncos tailgate and it can cook all we need. Accessories make this a traveling outdoor kitchen.
2,Dont shut the lid,I bought this for our RV because it folds up and can slide into a compartment. This is the only think i like about the grill it looks nice but burns way to HOT you can't cook with the lid down very messy grill hard to clean. the flame to grill is to close so dont plan to cook your best summer time burgers or chicken because this grill will dissapoint you
2,Coleman 9949-750 Road Trip Grill LXE (Red),"The Coleman Road trip grill LXE is a Great Product- I would highly recommend it for Camping, Tailgaiting whatever it does the job. I purchased the large griddle also for it and it works like a champ.I don't think you will be disappointed. it packs up nice and is easy to move around."
1,Will not light,"I purchased this for my daughter and had it shipped to her directly. It was recommended by consumer reports. But, now she has been unable to get it to light. Since she is an engineer, I doubt that she is not reading and interpreting the instructions properly. So now there's the hassle of shipping it back ! UGH!!!"
3,Appears to be all there...,"As we know it is the holiday season therefore when ordering online and given the option to send to an alternate address as well as selecting the ""gift"" in hopes the package will be somewhat discreet is not entirely true. This item was ordered and shipped as a ""gift"" but arrived in its original box even though the ""gift"" option was selected during checkout. Keep in mind if you are sending packages as gifts this season amazon may not use their typical brown box to be sent to the recipiant. Not sure about the details of the items in the box as my family has agreed to keep it in the box until Christmas so more to come on the durability of this product."
2,be careful!,after looking at several portable gas grills i decided on this partiuclar one. i loved the design and the fact it folded and had wheels and handle for moving. we have an RV and i thought it would be the perfect grill for our lifestyle. we used it twice with good results but on the third use a disaster occured. i had not read anywhere that said not to cook with the lid down and although we had on the previous occasions nothing bad happened. the third time the lid got too hot and when i tried to lift the lid by the plastic handle it had melted and pulled right off. melted plastic dripped down the front and i was fortunate i didn't get burned. putting a plastic handle on something that gets hot is not a good idea and i hope coleman will rethink that design. overall i do like the grill and we are still using it in the damaged state. it still grills well but for storage we now have to use a bungee cord to hold the lid in place when we roll the grill.
1,Coleman Barbecue,"The barbecue is easy to use and gets hot enough. The flame is under two areas, only. It acts more like a hot grill than a barbecue. Also, extremely hard to clean. You have to unnscrew the reflector plate to clean under it. It has universal use, but you must purchase separately the pot holder base as well as the grill surface. I threw it out after a fewe year's use. It was neither a good grill, nor adequate stove.Mike"
2,"Great product, built like crap","I love the functionality of the grill. Assembly would have been easy of the wheel bolt they included to attach the wheels actually fit the tread of the BBQ. Also the metal bracket that holds the gas snapped off like a twig, in-spite of the fact that it was metal"
3,"Cooks Pretty Well, not used friendly","I got this grill to mostly keep at home, and have the flexibility to take it camping and such. It sits and cooks pretty well, a little uneven as other reviewers have stated. I've had problems with the flexible part of it. It is very heavy, and quite unwieldy to stand up and down. It's really a two man operation, and led me to break one of the cheap plastic holders you see on the side of the tray. This seemed like a perfect compromise between portable and large and stable. If I were you, I'd get a simple grill like This Weber (http://www.amazon.com/Weber-1520-Propane-Go-Anywhere-Grill/dp/B00004RALK/ref=sr_1_29?ie=UTF8&qid=1355804752&sr=8-29&keywords=camp+grill) for on the go, and a nice larger one for home."
3,A little disappointed but time will see,"We received the grill yesterday, which is faster then we thought we would be receiving the grill because we are stationed overseas. But when we opened it we noticed it had scratches on the top and the wheels are very wobbly. We hope that it works just fine but we are a little disappointed on the condition we received it in. It would cost a fortune to send it back so we are going to wait it out and see if it will cook just fine even with the wobbly wheels."
4,"Works great as a regular grill, not just for camping","A few years ago I got one of these grills as a Christmas present, and I loved it! I actually used it as a regular grill, not just for camping or tailgating. It is easily portable so I also took it on trips, but it got more use at home. There are a couple of downfalls that made me give it four stars instead of five. The grill plates are very close to the flame, and it is very difficult to clean up. Other than that, it is just fine. I wish I had invested in a cover for it and then I would not have rusted it out through years of being outside."
5,Quick and easy set up,Quick and easy to set up. Doesn't require a lot of space to store cleans up easily. Great quallity product
5,Awesome!,"I first used one of these at on vacation. I bought one for home, as I have a small deck. This is compact and very effective. The cast grill top has a solid middle section that is great for flat cooking. I highly recommend this."
3,Experience could have been better...,"Too bad Coleman couldn't have packaged it better -- either the sealed bag of nuts, washers and assembly tool were just tossed in the main bag surrounding the grill which scraped the lid or they were in with wheels, etc and slipped out in to main bag during shipment which again scraped the lid -- because the box was damaged upon arrival and the enamel was chipped on the lid...rust is soon to follow! Definitely not pleased with this purchase."
5,Awesome,"This grill is very durable and easy to travel from place to place with. This grill has lasted us for over 2 tailgate seasons now and shows no signs of wearing down. We have cooked all kinds of foods with no problems and heat stays even and consistent. If you want to cook food in places you can't bring a large grill, get this one, you wont be disappointed."
2,Pretty but physically defective.,"We ordered this grill for our new motorhome. When we put it together, we saw that some of the red paint, about two inches along the back bottom edge of the lid, is severely scraped. Also, the black plastic around the front lock is cracked. I'm surprised Coleman puts out products with such obvious lack of quality control. We're leaving town in two days and decided to keep the flawed thing because we need it, but BUYER BEWARE."
5,Cold\eman road trip grill LXE,"Excellent grill, really gets hot, is a little heavy with the cast iron grill surfaces but it is worth it!! Delivered quickly from Amazon."
5,Only this Respighi and nothing else.,"Fritz Reiner surprises me here, despite his infamous reputation of being a tyranical, manipulative conductor whom his Chicago musicians had a hard time working with. That is because his handling of Respighi's Pines and Fountains of Rome are one of the finest recordings I've ever heard. There are the usual trademarks of precise and exciting playing, as demonstrated by the piece, pines by Villa Borghese. An average listener might felt ambushed by another typical Disney soundtract, except this sounds most exciting. The Pines at Janiculum and the Villa Medici Fountain at Sunset is Fritz Reiner at his most delicate and finest moment. Surprising, again since such warmth is unheard of a conductor of Reiner's reputation. I don't think I would want to own any other recordings of these magnificent works."
5,It works!,I bought this fore my daughter and her husband whose original remote was falling apart. It works fine. Not much else to say.
5,Works as tested.,"Just like the original. This is an OEM product as near as I can tell. No complaints! Now, if Dish network would iron out their $$ issues with select networks perhaps we all could watch the NFL playoffs. Go Seahawks!"
4,Dish remote control,Remote Control performed as was expected from a new control. Had to call Dish to get it properly working other than that every thing worked great.
5,Satellite Network Remote,"Our remote was ten (10) years old and needed replacement. We contacted our Satellite Network and was told the charge would be one hundred dollars ($100). It was much higher than we expected.Later, I checked Amazon and found the same remote for less than twenty-five ($25). It was simple to ""set up"" and works great!"
3,Devours batteries.,Works well for a month or so and then begins to hesitate. Need to then change batteries to restore functionality.
3,seems great,at first this was awesome and worked really well to replace my original remote. now it devours batteries: cheap ones and expensive ones
2,The Fidelity Wars,"I bought this CD without knowing who Hefner was, taking a gamble on it really I guess. I'd have to say I was disappointed with the CD for the most part with the exception of Hymn For the Cigarettes, which was by leaps and bounds the CDs strongest song. The rest of the album is much slower and honestly really forgettable."
3,Watercolor Portrait Painting,I bought this DVD when I wanted to improve on my watercolor portraits and costume fit. I really benefited on the part of the skin painting. The DVD have at least 5 to 6 practical videos to learn from. Although its a good reference for skin painting its not a good reference for people who would like to learn more on costume fit (painting the clothing). The author neglected this area.
5,Very Cool!!,"I love these torches. Easy, quick and maintenance free!! You do have to buy fuel seperately. Any hardware store, camping or super center should have fuel avaliable. No oils, no mess, no wet wicks. Just turn on the fuel and light!"
3,Not for novice,"I bought this album under the assumption that it would be of the same caliber of some of their other albums (not always a good idea). If you are interested in the boys, I suggest getting ""The Boys Collection."""
2,Disappointed,"Although I really like the cover of the album, I was disappointed to see that inside the album, there is no way to just slide the picture in; rather the picture needs to be glued to the paper. It does not sever my purpose but is a beautiful piece of art. I hate to return it because this company is a small scale business."
3,"King Crimson - 'Collector's King Crimson, Vol. 1' (DGM) 3 1/2 stars","This review is for disc three only. See a separate review I did for disc one. CD # 3 is from a German gig that took place on October 17, 1972. Have to wonder if this is the entire concert, as it has just three songs. Sound quality has a few flaws, but still very acceptable. The thirty-minute ""Rich Tapestry Of Life"" is probably the best cut here. As if you're a major Crimson nut or even a completist (which I'm neither) you would obviously get more out of ""Exiles"" and ""Larks Tongues In Aspic (Part 1)"" than I did. A decent live, previously unreleased vintage concert from one of the most 'out-standing' progressive bands left over from the '70's."
5,Excellent Book on Negotiation,"More than just a ""how to"" book on negotiation, Radical Collaboration helps you understand yourself and your response to conflict. Backed by relevant theory and many examples, it provides practical exercises to help you ""unhook"" your hot buttons and build your confidence for handling difficult negotiations. A must for anyone interested in conflict resolution, negotiation skills, or self development."
5,Incredibly helpful,"I loved this book. The concepts were easy for me to understand and useful in all aspects of my life (at work and in personal relationships.) For example, knowing when I'm being defensive (red zone) vs. non-defensive and authentic (green zone) has helped me to be more effective when someone pushes my buttons. The book teaches helpful tools like an early warning system to tip me off when I'm starting to get defensive, and the negotiating process to deal with conflict. The examples are easy to relate to and apply. I wish more of my co-workers would read it!"
2,Great concept but lenghty and overly simple book,"The theory behind the book is great and certainly works, however the book in itself is highly disappointing due to great lenghts to go over basic concepts with fake cute-ish examples and practical exercises that do not really provide a plus.It really seems to dumb down every detail to fill the standard 250 pages but would be much better in 20 good pages.Concept and theory explained in the book: 4.5/5Reading experience : 1/5"
5,Very Helpful,"Authors were ahead of their time. Nine years later, this is still the cutting edge of business and the secret to increased profits."
5,A Sleeper Hit,"Not many people know of the actor Norman Reedus or this movie. This movie isn't your average film noir and nor is it your average lame documentary type film. This is a full-length picture look into the restlessness of the human condition, the need of every human soul to be loved and find love, however and whenever they can. Worth it from beginning to end."
2,"Interesting in concept, difficult in reality","I am an avid cook and know how to follow a recipe. I made Artichoke & Tomato Turnover with Herb Puree. After hours of chopping, simmering, making & rolling dough, etc, the results were inedible. The cream cheese dough was made is cream cheese, butter and flour; part of the butter melted out when it was baked. I can't imagine drizzling olive oil with herbs and romano cheese on top as the recipe directs. I later calculated that the recipe was 4000 calories for 4 servings. Trotter's ""Cooks at Home"" or Keller's ""Bouchon"" are better and more practical if you actually plan to make the recipes."
5,Chicago's Own Best,"I wait with anticipation each time Charlie Trotter releases a cook book, time after time after time, it is different and exciting. This is what, his eleventh one! Last year it was RAW, this time its television cooking art. What more this book includes meat & vegetarian recipes which are delicious & ELEGANT. I like books with photographs of the dish, this book has that & behind the scenes photography. To me, it is interesting to see how cooking shows & cook books develope. If you have never enjoyed a cook book...this one has all the action. It is a perfect example of how great chefs keep their cuisine progressive and us throughly entertained by their amazing food."
3,Can be dangerous.,"While the solar filter works well, keep an eye on the filter. The mylar tends to slip off of the filter when it gets hot. If you are looking at the sun and it slips off, you could seriously damage your eyes."
1,Full of Misleading Facts,"This book is far from the truth in the viewpoint of history and compilation of Guru Granth Sahib. The author purposes that Goindval Pothis are the source of Guru Granth Sahib which is an incorrect statement. Prof. Sahib Singh, a renowned Sikh scholar, refuted such propositions almost 100 years ago. Maan, Pashaura, Harjot etc all are twisting facts and intentionally writing to mislead the readers. Many Sikh scholars have refuted Maan's book and his foolish baseless opinions. I would recommend staying away from such writers who call themselves ""Sikh scholars"" and get their degrees from a Christian missionary (Mcleod). These people have no clue about what facts are and Sikhism is all about. Get ""Early Sikh Scriptural Tradition: Myth and Reality"" by Balwant Singh Dhillon which not only refutes Maan's book but is also an in depth analysis of Goindval Pothis and discusses their validity and authenticity. The book can be found online at [...]"
5,"Wonderful, sad, honest...an awesome blend of emotions","Larry Colton does a great job of telling the tales of a group of college buddies. Colton, a former major league pitcher, does not favor his career over the stories of the others. He is blunt, funny, melancholic and pretty much every other emotion somewhere in the book. I thought I would enjoy the baseball parts (and I did), but I really loved reading about the rest of the college buddies.With such great talent, I hope Larry writes another book, just on his own career."
4,Goat Brother success,This was a good book and kept my interest. I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened to all the fraternity brothers as they went along in life.
4,Awesome Purchase,"Hello:Allow me first to say I'm a Law Student and the substantial amount of reading I face with everyday it is sometimes impossible to acquire concentration for extended periods of time. I bought this CD a week ago and i must say this was a gift from God. I play the CD while I do my usual readings and I have noticed that not only i go through my readings faster, but also everything I read sticks with me (reducing the law school chiche of READ, RE-READ and READ AGAIN in order to understand the law), PLUS the music is BEAUTIFUL!!!. I will definitely recommennd this CD if you're a student, or a workaholic or simply you jsut want to enjoy the riches of delighting your ears to the magnificent sounds of classical music."
4,Good for study,"There are two ways that one can listen to this: one, mixed in at random with other stuff and two, by itself in a deliberate manner.As a collection of ""song length"" compositions, this is a nice way to get some classical music into one's collection. It would be a good gift for a student. Mixed with other tracks, it's refreshing to listen to. I don't that you get the full effect of this CD when listening to it this way.Ideally, this is a CD to listen to in a deliberate way. Listen to it when you first get to work in the morning, and are organizing your day. Put this is a study center for students. The power is this CD is in repeated listening and to create a ""sense of space."""
5,Excellent for its intended purpose,"For concentration enhancement, its done wonders for enduring focus for both my studies and every day menial tasks. I find my mind wandering far less. The only discrepancy I can see is its encompassing effectiveness. I have experienced better results for both memory and concentration with other audios. With this audio Ive experienced an awakened drive to be productive or use my mind. Memory isnt necessarily effected, but I have a state of mind where I can sit and do something for an extended period of time. In all honesty, its smooth classical feel alone would be worth the purchase. I have a pretty vast collection of both classical works and mind enhancement music tracks so I have much to compare it with. In conclusion, for concentration it does its job well. For extended effects in relation to memory, mental clarity and cognition there are other products that work better."
1,Very uncomfortable shoe,"This shoe looked nice and stylish, but turned out to be very narrow (even though I've ordered it in size wide!!!) and uncomfortable. Also had some glue marks on it--I had to return it."
5,Life Stride Shoes,"Great product and timely shipment but found this style shoe did not fit at my regular size. No problem--I returned them immediately and replacement shoes were received within the week, with absolutely no hassle."
2,Better products available,"I bought this because my local woodworkers supply did not have pine.The glue backing on this brand is too thick & shows a ""glue line"" when applied.Get another higher quality brand."
5,A Life Worth Living - Gertrude Stonesifer,"Seriously enjoyable reading about Gertrude's and her sister, Helen's, lives. It starts in Colorado, where both ladies were born, and then they travel to Illinois by train after the deats fo both parents to be adopted and live with relatives. Trials, tribulations, fortunes and misfortunes, successes and failtures; Sister and Me has them all.Both sisters led interesting and fulfilling lives. One lived to age 85, and the other is still living and now 96. Buy it, enjoy it, and share your reaction to it."
2,A great buy,Just got my in the mail and OMG is this thing sharp! I was able to cut through box it came in like a hot knife through warm butter. Although it was a little tight the dirk does fit in the scabbard. I absolutely love the simple yet elegant design of the handle. I would love to see Cold Steel make a matching Sgian-dubh!Edit: I too have been having some serious rust spot issues with mine. I recently pulled it out of it's sheath and found the bottom half of the blade covered in little red spot. I'm very disappointed with it.
4,Nice Sound!,"Starting a new year I want to try some new things. I'm going to use this cd in my classroom to promote learning. I own other music collections, but I need to step out and try new things. I've listed to this cd and I think its ok. I really don't like using mp3's I'm a little old school and like physical cd's."
5,Highly recommended,"We played this CD to our newborn and really enjoy it. And it's not just for babies. This is the kind of classical music that works so well while the kids paint, do homework or engage on any activity that requires quiet time. I have heard other Mozart CDs for babies, but they don't have as good orchestral arragements as this one."
5,Build baby's brain with Classics Vol 2,"I am a true fan of Classical music and this was purchased as a gift for a co-worker who is adopting a child from China. Therefore I did not open it nor listen to it. The recipient is now overseas picking up their daughter so I know they haven't had the opportunity to listen to it. I think it's a great idea, though."
1,simple minded,"The author's ""method"" is something that any 5-year-old would dismiss as simplistic. The book reads as if the author typed it at a single stretch and then took it down to Kinko's to copy. Except that Kinko's would have done a better job with the design and layout. My one-star rating is about 1 star more than the book deserved."
1,Big disappointment,"The ""new method"" alluded to in the subtitle is agaggle of facile, self-evident observations that can be summarized inabout 3 pages.( ) an awful lot of money to pay for ""fortune cookie"" analysis."
4,Living With Loss and Grief,"I purchased all these books for the library of the local Compassionate Friends chapter - which I am co-founder. I haven't had alot of time to totally read them all but, just scanning through, I think they will be helpful to our grieving parents. Delivery on all books was acceptable; books were in very good condition."
2,"Nice idea, but could be made better for the price","I bought this for my daughter. She loves all the Bratz Babyz accessories. She was hoping for a ""storage"" like box for all the small pieces to go in. But this ""lunch box"" does not close well at all! It has no latch for the lid, and so when she carries it, everything falls out.It is good for a ""room"" for the dolls, but not a carrying case.This goes for all the other ""lunch box"" rooms they make for Bratz Babyz."
3,Later Alice Cooper,"This Cd highlight's shock rock king Alice Cooper's late 80s and early 90s material. You could even make an argument he's a one hit wonder with Poison. Cooper lost his ability to shock people in the early 80s, but it's a credit to his songwriting skills the cuts on this disc work anyway."
2,"Super Hits? Uh, not quite...","Seems Columbia's entire ""Super Hits"" series takes one or two actual ""hit"" songs from the artist, then tosses in a number of album filler crap to pad it out so it LOOKS like a bargain. Granted, not all these artists HAD 10 or 12 songs the average person might recognize, but you'd be better off cherry-picking the actual hits from other superior ""greatest hits"" collections.Honestly, this Alice Cooper collection is the lamest of the ones I've looked at. I don't recall ANY of these songs being anything CLOSE to a hit, but obviously the band had a lot of very big songs -- look elsewhere."

3,Research for the Health Professional,"The book arrived quickly and I thought in good condition until I had to remove the extra sticker added to the bottom of the book. Now the book has a sticky film across the bottom and I barely used it for school, so now when I go to sell it back I probably won't be able to get that good of a price for it because it has this damage. When before I could have sold it 'like new' because I didn't even use it."
5,Great tool for remembering my college German for upcoming trip,"I bought this to refresh my german before our trip to Germany. It is a wonderful tool - if you already know the language. The exercises are completely in german, so you should be able to learn vocabulary in context. I LOVE SCHAUM'S! They produce wonderful study tools in math, physics, and chemistry also."
2,Information Too Difficult to Find and Too Small Print to Read,"This book contains a lot of information, however some of it is too difficult to locate and the print is so small that you have to use a magnafying glass to read it!! I have used it twice and threw it in a drawer. I would not recommend this book!!!"
5,A Great Album,"This is a great album.The lyrics are great,the production is great and most of all the ladies love it!!!Nitty Green,Spanky,G-Fly,chill,and stylz really did their thing"
1,Poorly Made e-book for kindle,"I found out I had the incorrect book and returned it to amazon but when i was using it , the formatting and everything was haphazard for the kindle version YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.*EDIT:I would really like to stress that for 84$ this is slightly egregious how much this book is messed up, it shouldnt be on the market let alone for that price with all the glaring issues in this edition.I purchased the physical textbook, while bulky, it has everything in working order and I have no other opinion on the actual course material seeing how Im taking a course which is for general education requirements (which uses this book)"
5,Great Seller!,"The book arrived in great conditions! Also, I was a little worried that I would not have the book in time for my class... but I was wrong. Great timing too! Would buy from this seller again!GloriaYuma, AZ"
5,Beautiful Book,"Danielle Bean truly captures the highs and lows of motherhood in this rare collection of honest and inspiring essays. I smilingly related to Bean as she explained how motherhood transformed her from mouse-like to bear-like in ""Bear Instincts."" I cheered when she described Laundry, Supermarket, and Dinner as Olympic events in ""Mom Olympics."" I found myself holding back tears as she described the loveliness of her home as it appeared to her one winter night from the outside, from a distance, in ""A Joyful Noise."" From the first essay to the last, Bean's perspective is as wise as it is endearing. Any mother who treasures her faith and family will find much in _My Cup of Tea_ to take heart in."
4,Encouragement for Catholic Moms,"Danielle is an experienced writer, and she puts her talents to good use here, by sharing her day-to-day life with small children. Her words were inspirational to me (especially since she has more children than I do, and seems to have a lot of patience!) and I could relate to many of the situations. One story, particularly, about her son not wanting kisses and hugs, and then later on saying he wanted to marry her, was very touching.The chapters are short, helpful, inspirational and humorous. A good gift for a Catholic mom for Mother's Day."
2,Difficult to follow.,"I liked the main characters and I really did want to like the book as well, but I found the plotting choppy and uneven with skips and jumps all over the place. I kept having to back track to see who was who and what was going on-- too much effort for what should be a cozy diversion and no other redeeming value to make it worth the time.Too bad."
3,"Not bad, but it runs a little too hot for my tastes","The Coleman stove works good, but as some previous reviewers have said, it runs very hot. I have to keep the burners on about as low as it goes, because the burners stay on so high, that you have to be very careful for not burning anything. I had a hard time with chicken and making popcorn (the old fashioned way) and never burn anything at home, but with this stove, you have to CONSTANTLY watch it. Other than that, it is OK and does the trick. The igniter works well. And the grill gives good taste. But I would say, it needs improvement with control of heat."
3,good idea but beware teflon grill,"Coleman stoves are functional and durable and a good buy when on sale. Combining a stove and grill is a good idea, but beware because this one comes with a nonstick teflon grill. I don't like any nonstick teflon cookware, but if careful, the optional griddle is okay until it starts to wear. But grills get too hot for teflon. I bought this anyway and purchased a Lodge iron grill to use instead. Nothing lasts longer than cast iron, and you can get one pre-seasoned. Once seasoned, iron works like nonstick without the danger. Both are heavy and only suitable for car camping. But the iron grill can also be used with a campfire or coals.Note: this is the newer model, and it is a little nicer than the older one but seems basically the same. I don't know if the optional griddle fits this one. Both have a teflon grill."
4,Coleman 9922-750 propane grill,"Compact, yet when in use has plenty of surface space and excellent heat."
4,Gourmet Camping,"Since I couldn't bring my Viking stove to Zion, this Coleman grill substituted just fine. We grilled lamb chops and made pilaf at the same time. Electronic ignition fired things up on first start. My only criticism is that I wish the griddle was not teflon coated. Although the surface was non-stick, I am concerned about the chemical release when the temperature gets too hot."
4,Coleman Grill Stove,A great versatile product. Enjoy grilled meat without having to carry around a purpose built grill or light a fire. Had seen a similar product from an unknown brand but preferred to search out the Coleman product. It just works as it was intended.
4,Groovy album,"Wow, not bad. This being my first listen to Tinstar, I'm quite impressed. With glimpses of U2 and INXS crossed with signature electro fuzzed guitars, I think these guys offer something very sincere to Modern Rock Music. I could be wrong, of course. I picked this disc up on a recommendation of a friend and I would say it's worth every penny. The songs are well crafted and the vocals are just fresh enough to keep me interested. ""Sunshine"" is a bit of a dancey number, almost with a slight New Madonna styled beat and groove to it with ""Pacify"" being a downtempo, stoner classic. If I had to pick a solid single off this disc it would have to be ""Treacle"" which would feel right at home on the dancefloor and would be ripe for a Fila Brazlia or King Tweak remix. So much of what I hear just seems bland, but Tinstar definitely stand out. If you're looking for a good solid disc to add to your collection, pick this up."
3,treasure island,"BUYER BEWARE! like the other pirate toys I bought from this company, I found this product to be deceiving. The box depicts pirate figures, treasure chest etc. but the fine print indicates that the product is really only the basic island. The toy is well made and quite durable, however it can be frustrating that the cave doesn't anchor well into the base and had to be fixed several times while playing.."
5,Amazing,"If any of you have arthritis in your hands...look no further than this whisk. It fits in your hand beautifully and has an extremely comfortable grip. This wihsk is very well made! I do wish that this size came in different colors. I do like yellow, but this yellow is a little too yellow for me. I would have loved it if it came in Dark Red, Black or Cream as these are my kitchen colors. But other than the color...I love it!"
2,Too Big for Small Ears,"This work well, however they are still too big for my ears. One inevitably keeps popping out, which makes it difficult to keep it on my head. The sound quality and everything else is great, I just wish the ear buds were smaller."
2,flimsy,"headband is very flimsy and will not stay on my head. I spend the majority of my workout holding the ear pieces to my ears. The headband piece needs to be a little more ridged. The price is right, I guess - but would not recommend. Looking for a different product."
2,Debris,"Fairly disappointed. I was expecting much more from it. Basically, it's about a guy driving around showing debris (sometimes driving up and down the *same* street!). Very irritating ""soundtrack."" Could have been summed up in 2-5 mins. I didn't rate it a 1 because it did provide one of the things I wanted - images of the devastation. Otherwise, it would have been a ""0"" or a ""1"" tops. Good intentions, but pretty bad execution. Sorry... I do not recommend this product."
5,A very good book,"There are three books in the series: The Warrior, The Champion, and The Highlander. I read The Champion first and really liked it a lot so I immediately went to Amazon and bought The Warrior. The Warrior was very good as well and I will definitely get the third book in the series. I normally don't read books out of order, but I had gotten the second book from a library book sale and decided for once I was just going to read what I already had - luckily, it didn't ruin the first book for me."
4,Yay! Another Bush/Pearl Jam/Stereophonics (delete as appl),"Sorry. Bit cynical. Just that Yesterday Went Too Soon is the work of a band who clearly believe that grunge, in it's most basic Pearl Jam/Ten state, is still well and alive. And that's not necessarily a criticism, just that you'll have heard this stuff done a million times before...but rarely better. YWTS is so obviously aimed at the American market that I cannot believe it hasn't even got a release date over there yet. From the catchy punk pop of Day In Day Out and Insomnia to the plaintive Paperfaces, this pulls all the right strings and pulls them remarkably well. The best thing is undoubtedly the anthemic power pop of the title track. They're a good live band too so catch them while you can still see them at medium-sized venues!"
5,Absolutely fantastic cd!,"I attended a concert recently in Savannah, Georgia, where I got to hear Gary Puckett sing his all-time greatest hits. He was incredible, and sounded as great as ever. And, man, did the memories of yester-year come rushing back! That's why I bought this cd. I wanted a cd with the just the absolute greatest hits. This is it. All of Gary Puckett and the Union Gap's original recordings of their greatest hits on one cd. This cd is absolutely fantastic, and a ""must"" for every true Gary Puckett fan!"
5,great adventures,"two good movies not to miss at all with lot of insights in both of them,i did really enjoy them."
3,"Still a strong series, but....","I am really enjoying this series, especially with seeing the different lands in this world. However, the character of Tovin seems to be wasted in this book. In the last book, he didn't seem to even think about getting married, but all the sudden, in this book, it's paramount to him. He seems used and abused, and I thought Rani was smarter than that. Also, after being so central in the last book, Mareka has faded from sight. I'd love to see Rani reconciled to Tovin, rather than with Hal, which is where I think the last book will end up. Still, if you're a fan, it's worth it to buy this one."
2,A Pity,"Although this is a strong series, and the world is well-developed, this was a disappointing entry. The characterization seems to have slipped a little, and the plot is degenerating to the point that it's starting to feel like a soap opera.Klasky can do better; I'll probably read the next one (assuming there is a next one) only because she raised a couple of questions in this book that I'd like to see answered. After that, if the writing, plotting and characterization don't improve I'll probaby wave this series goodbye."
2,Not helpful,"I recently moved into a new apartment and my cat responded to the stress by urinating all over the corner of my living room, including the side of my couch. I tried several treatments of this product on that spot, and even resorted to dumping the whole gallon into the corner. The only thing that happened was my whole apartment smelled like minty cat pee. I don't know if this product might be more useful in smaller accidents, but it certainly did nothing for my problem. I found that using vinegar followed by A LOT of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and a few drops of dish soap does a fantastic job. This still took a few treatments and a week worth of re-soaking the carpet, but every time I did it I could tell the smell was lessening. The smell is finally gone after all of that work - it is easy to find others online who had the same success with cheap household products. You don't have to waste your money!"
2,The sprayer immediately stopped working.,I hate when you buy a product and the sprayer stops working. The product did not work for us and I will look for something else.
1,"Way overpriced for a low quality, simple box","You can buy the same case at Harbor Freight without the Spektrum logo for $25. At that price it's a decent way to protect your controllers. At this price, no way!"
5,great stuff,"it is surprisingly silky, soft, and smooth.Right after I placed the order, I remember thinking that for that price, it must not have been a good product. Receiving it one week later to find the color brilliant, quality surpassed expectation. What a buy!!!"
1,Actual colors are horrible!,"The rug looks bright and cheery online, and I was excited to put in our upstairs hallway as a light and airy runner. However, the colors you see online are not at all what you actually will get. The pretty yellow is actually a mustard color, and the green is almost neon. It is more than a little awful!"
1,WOW! Stainless Steel Cleaner and Protector,This product is awful... leaves a greasy film that bubbles
4,A must for the Avenger collector,"I found this DVD very intriguing because it allows the viewer to see the evolution of the show.My favorite duo is John Steed and Emma Peel and was a little disappointed that there was just a small interview segment with Lady Rigg back to what seems to be the eighties. I would love to see her in a current lengthy interview explaining the show and maybe taking questions from an audience panel. However, this show has not been part of her life for many years and she is more engaged in the theater.Anyway, I love this DVD because it covers the whole spectrum of the show from the early episodes to the very last series with Ms. Lumley. It definitely is a must for the collector."
2,I wanted to like it . . .,"I wanted to read these short stories and fall in love with each and every one. I just felt like something was lacking. I find it to be mundane and near poorly written. I hate the simplistic descriptions, there's no artistic quality to it, which makes it seem like any one could've written this piece of nothing. The stories are interesting but they lack something that cannot be fingered. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
5,Stories that feel like memories,"I read these short stories one story at a time, often with several days in between. I kept thinking that each one was better than the one before. Each one had an essence that evoked poignant memories of every stage of life, even though the scenes and the characters ranged widely. Each also caused at least one breath-catching realization about life that had never occurred to me before, or had a lovely twist that brought forth a sigh, or a knowing shake of my head at an ""out-of-the-mouths-of babes"" moment or one for how trustingly childlike we can be at any age."
5,Gritty Girl,This collection reminded me of a cross between Flannery O'Connor and A.M Homes. O'Connor in the way she captures the dark edges of adult womanhood and Homes in her daring studies of youth. A top notch collection that should have garnered more attention than it did. Beth Ann--please write more!
5,A great summer read,"So maybe it is because I finished this book on the beaches of Long Island that I was so pleased with it, but the fact remains that the author does an incredible job of painting the picture of Amagansett in the 40s. The character development and scenic descriptions are incredible. Once you get past the first 40-50 pages, you get most of the names straight and it is smooth sailing after that. A very good story, well told. A much better read than Atonement."
3,Great price for 900 Mhz but no ring volume control,"I probably would not have purchased this if I knew how loud the ringer was and that there was no way to turn it down. Furthermore, to turn off the ringer you have to press some inane sequence of keys too hard to remember. Nevertheless, I don't think you can find 900 Mhz clarity at a price this low. I was able to adjust the ring tone to something less piercing than the default so I guess I'll keep it."
1,USELESS,I bought this phone and it does not work after 2 months. Nothing was spilled in it and it wasnt dropped. None of the buttons work and I will never buy a vtec phone ever again. I will also inform others as well about its defects. I don't even have enough money now to replace it. Thank you for nothing.Cory Malatesta
1,an okay phone,"This phone worked well for the first few months, but then the hand set went dead. The answering machine works but there is no way to access the menu with out the hand set. so now i have to buy batteries for the hand set. all in all its not a bad deal."
3,"Good phone considering the price, but the battery isn't good","For the price, the phone is an excellent bargain. But the battery discharges too fast. Since since I got it really cheap using a coupon from UnderTag.com, I can't really complain."
2,"Good sound, battery died prematurely; battery no longer made","I bought this phone for Christmas of 2000; it gave a good performance until very recently. Sound was good on it, no echo, no static. However, exactly six months after purchase, the battery died and I've been informed that the battery is no longer made. There is no reason that the battery should have died this early, as we always kept the handset on the charge cradle. I'm glad this phone didn't cost much or I would be pretty mad about the 6-month life."
1,Disappointing product,"I purchased the VTech 9108 primarily for its affordability, easy to use features, its sleek styling, and its light weight. Unfortunately, after about a month of use in a single person household (i.e. I don't have kids and I never dropped it!), static during calls increased, along with odd clicking sounds. Progressively, the phone has worsened so that the channel changer does not have any effect. I overhear other people's calls frequently, and the static increases so significantly after about 7 minutes of talk time (something in the phone wiring must be heating up after a certain amount of use), I can't even hear the other person. The warranty which requires one to send the product back insured, followed by weeks of waiting for the company to decide whether to fix the phone or send you a new one isn't really worth the effort and the fact that one has to get a new phone anyhow during the wait. Very disappointing phone."
5,Great listening,"I discovered Pinmonkey recently and really like all the tunes on the album. Rock and Country sound combined to give you that ""good feeling"". Worth getting."
3,"Have not tried it yet,but....","I have not tried the knife yet, but I must say I am disappointed in the customer service I recieved. After trying to find out the answer to my question (did the knife come with a protective sheath) via e-mail unsuccessfully, I called Customer Service. After holding for a significant amount of time, the representative came back on the line and told me it did. I ordered the product only to find it didn't when it arrived. I have not opened it yet because I want to get a protector first."
3,Easy Rider,"As a relatively new student of the Italian language, I was looking for an easy, light read that I could enjoy with minimum use of my dictionary. The ""Manuale"" proved the perfect choice. To paraphrase the author, the subject is secondary; more important is the process. In this case, Severgnini's process (more like a Powerpoint than a book) is to present his observations of different classes of travelers into a sort of taxonomy. There's the Petulant, the Diffident, the Provident and many more. His descriptions all have a bit of truth scattered through the funny stuff. It's not great literature, but it worked for me. If you can read Italian, and you want a change of pace---this is no Tom Clancy---you just might want to bring along this entertaining little travel companion."
5,Century of Warfare.,Century of Warfare was a good buy at a great price . I have watched all the volumes and completely happy with their content
3,NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED,I like the product. I do not like the fact that amazon advertised it as a closed caption product when it is not. This shouldn't be difficult to figure out for the amazon people.
3,"Confusing, but Good","I find the style confusing. Sometimes I can't tell if the section I am reading is text or if it is a quote from someone in the past. However, it is full of interesting facts and lots of pictures. I have a particular fascination for Old West history, and this closes a gap in my material."
5,Insprirational and Informative,"The main thing I look for in a book on writing is inspiration--something that will urge me to eagerly sit at the computer and plug away at the current project, even though the project itself may not be all that inspiring or, on that particlar day, I feel anything but inspired. Mr. Sasser's book does just that--but not only that. He gives very practical advice to writers as well as sharing stories about how he himself developed as a writer. I recommend it to anyone interested in the art and craft of writing."
5,Excellent reference book,"Who better to give a writer tips for success than such a prolific author as Mr. Sasser? This book is written in a way to be helpful without being patronizing. If you follow the steps in this book, you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish. I know I am. Thank you, Charles!"
5,A winner!,"One of our son's absolute favorites! Van Fleet uses a diverse set of animals (weasel, skunk, alligator, pangolin, peacock), and the pull tabs are extremely sturdy."
4,Beautiful picture books for Children but has to be used carefully,"We bought the book because we purchased earlier the ""Heads"" book in a book store. The design is very nice and our little son loves to see the moving images or to touch the special fields.The only not well made thing is the durability of the book. Little children want to grab moving things and not always moving parts like tails are covered so that a child can see it moving without grabbing it...Overall still a great book and I would like to see more books from Matthew Van Fleet (see also ""Heads"" and ""Alphabet"")"
3,Poor Book Binding,"Just as the HEADS book, the quality of the workmanship of the book is poor. The binding is easily torn by an adult, much less a toddler/infant. Doesn't hold up very well for the price of a board book. The animation is so cute and fun to use. Does require adult assistance/supervision to operate the animation if used by a young toddler/infant."
4,Very cute book,"I bought this for my 11 month old daughter when she had become obsessed with Pat The Bunny. I was looking for another ""Touch and Feel"" style book. This book has several furry tails, levers one can pull to move cardboard tails, as well as a couple of pull out slides and one scratch and sniff sticker. My daughter is particularly fond of a couple of the furrier tails, and she enjoys it when I tug the levers to move the cardboard tails.I can recommend this book without reservation, but my daughter does prefer a couple of other books we've gotten for her, such as Pat the Bunny and others. Perhaps she will like this one more as she grows older. Right now it entertains her, but it's not her favorite.The book is sturdy and well-made, but my toddler requires supervision when playing with it lest she rip it apart."
5,Love the movements!,"My 7 month old loves this book. He always watches the moving objects on the page. This one and Heads are our favorites. Sturdy too, no worries of baby destroying it quickly."
5,Tails,"This is a ""touch & feel"" book with nice heavy pages not easily torn by little fingers. There are also several pages with a tab to slide so that the tails wag."
5,Perfect for Little hands!,My daughter LOVES this book!! She is 2 and can easily move the tabs to wag the tails!!! The pictures are colorful and each page has something for her to touch or discover!! This book is one of my favorites as well!! I love that its not large and bulky like some of her other books. Travels easily in diaper bag.
5,"Fun, educational, a real winner","This is a charming and fun book. Everyone I have bought it for (including my own toddlers/preschoolers) has loved it. The tactile pieces are interesting, the characters mischevious, the paper sturdy and the moveable pieces fun. The ending pullout with the whale makes for an interesting ending."
2,Eh...,"My 14 month-old daughter LOVES Cat and Dog by Van Fleet and we have to read them at least 10 times a day, but has yet to get into this book. I'd skip buying this one...it lacks the charm and whimsy of the other two."
4,Hoops,I just love these earring I wear them quite often if you see them from a distance you would think that they were gold instead of sterling silver
1,Wrong product,"They sent me data cable not charger!The good think that I still can charge via USB but it's datacable, not charger!"
4,Punk that revolves around a kids life,"""Hopeless Romantic"" contains many elements through the eyes of a kid. There also happens to be a song called "" kid"" which is perfect for the theme of the album. Mabye some might disagree, but I seem to relate to the songs. It really is a great cd. This is a must-have for Bouncing Souls fans! So all you punker kids out there, get this cd!"
3,Bouncing Souls NJ kickin it 4-Ever,"I think that although this album seems like they've slowed down a bit, the Bouncing Souls will forever be the best live. If you have never seen them play live then you are for sure missing out. So go to a show, support the scene, and always remember your roots!"
3,Best album? I think not,"I love the Bouncing Souls. They are by far my favorite band. They rock live, and they do well in the studio. But this album is just sub-par. The first five tracks are right on track for the souls, and ""Ole"" and ""Monday Morning..."" move the band subtley in a new direction, but are still trademark souls songs. There are really just too many downers on this album. ""Night on Earth"" for example, would be a rad song except that it drones on for three minutes after the lyrics end. This album is for someone who already likes the souls; it should not be used as a measuring stick for the band. ""Hopeless.."" shows the souls losing there edge, but continuing to be a great band."
5,one h**l of a cd!,The bouncing souls are one of the best bands out there. This is probably there best album though. it's sure to please you.
5,The Bouncing Souls NEED to be in your record collection!!,"This was the 1st Bouncing Souls Cd I ever listened to and I was totally grabbed by ""Hopeless Romantic"" I became hooked after ""Ole!"" and ""Monday Morning Ant Brigade"". After practially wearing out my friends copy, I bought my own and obssesively played it, especially during the World Cup (2002) for all the footie fans in our place.This is probably the best cd I own cause these guys put so much meaning into the songs. You can take so much from all the songs on here, whether it be a good time or a contemplative time of how life goes on (Kid, Night on Earth) surviving bad times (Fight to live) and even having some kind of warm memory in time (Undeniable)This is a great DC. Go and get it and you won't be disappointed."
4,fun,"This is a fun CD. Nothing life changing, no jaw-dropping arrangments, guitar work, lyrics, anything like that, but solid, fun, and highly enjoyable. i love the song ""'87"". Listen to that song if you're ever feeling sad i guarantee it will cheer you up. So yea go buy it defintley worth your money."
5,Amazing,"I must start by saying that this is the best punk album to come out in 1999. Considering that we saw rad releases from H2O, Sick of it All, Dropkick Murphys, Good Riddance, and US Bombs, this is very commendable. Every song on this album is great and the lyrics are what keeps me going. I have a workshirt that says ""Bouncing Souls Hopeless Romantic"" and a huge broken heart on it that I wear with pride when my band plays on stage. The recording on this album is also flawless which makes it even more pleasant to listen to. Everybody that I know loves the Bouncing Souls and if you buy this album then you will definately know why. I don't want to be trendy, but I must finish off by saying that the best song on this album is ""kid"", a true masterpiece."
2,Major disapointment,"this cd was just a major disappointment the entire way through. it seems like they put no effort in this album. the bouncing souls are one of my favorite bands so i would recommend anchors aweigh, how i spent my summer vacation, and maniacal laughter."
5,New Jersey's finest do it again!!!!!!!,"Being a punk rock fan for most of my life (I'm 27), I can say not many bands can put out great albums on a consistent basis. The Ramones, Superchunk, Replacements and now the best punk band since the Descendents...The Bouncing Souls. This album is solid, true to their roots and style, and still holding on to the punk rock edge with a tight grip. I saw them live right before the release of this album and the new songs hit me hard before you could even buy them. The title track shreds, '87 is a classic Souls stomp, Bullying the Jukebox is simple & clever at the same time and the duet/duel between Greg & Kara in ""Wish Me Well, You Can Go to Hell"" is the best duo since Westerberg/Napolitano. Suggested to anyone who likes real old school punk in a new school era. Best Tracks: ALL OF THEM!!!!!! Especially: Wish Me Well..., Monday Morning Ant Brigade & Night On Earth"
3,For the novice to intermediate skier,"Cross-Country Skiing by Ned Gillette, John Dostal will appeal to the active person wanting to take-up the sport of nordic skiing. Why 3 stars? Because skate skiing is covered only at a novice to intermediate level (see cover photo)and would be of limited use to the more advanced crowd."
5,"excellent overview of a sport, and a good read too","Too many manuals are written without a sense of humour, but this one doesn't suffer there. The authors write in a way as to appeal and interest across all levels. This book is useful for an XC skiier to help hone their skiing, and useful to loan to doubting friends to get them interested."
2,ok,i think the book had good points about candel magick. but for the most partthe book was made to be exceedenly complecated. thruth magick does not need to be complecated. use your heart.
5,Even better than the first book by R. Buckland!,"This is a sequel to Raymond Buckland's ""Practical Candleburning Rituals"" and I think it is actually better than the first. There are more advanced and detailed (hence the title) rituals/spells, and contains many different ones that weren't covered in the first book. There is also an extensive correspondence table section in the back which covers many different aspects, from colors, gemstones, days, astrological signs, substitutions for herbs that can be used, etc. This is definately a worthwhile book to have if you want to do any sort of candle magick or spells, plus it's not complicated or difficult to understand. It's even written to be usable for those who are not of Pagan/Wiccan faith, as the incantations are written twice, one with a Pagan/Wiccan theme and one with a Biblical theme. It even goes into preparing for the spells, with timing and such. Overall one of the best candle magick books out there, I refer to mine often."
3,"O,K, spell book","Not my favorite. I have lots of ingredients, but some of the stuff he wants you need to rob a bank to get. Dorothy Morrison has much better books on spells and they are simple and effective and isn't that why we do spells? We want them to work but not go broke doing them."
4,cloe- the cutest bratz baby!,"cloe is so adorable! i think she has the cutest little pig tails! the reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have baby sasha and sometimes i can get sick of her. i might only get sick of her because she only has 2 outfits and theres nothing really left 2 do with her, though. so, my advice is that if u r gonna get this doll for like a ten year old or older then it probably wont be very fun for them unless they get alot of outfits and accessories for the doll, so that they have something to do with it, and so it can be fun to put different outfits on it. i definitely recommend this doll for younger kids, but i dont recommend it for older kids as much."
1,if you don't think babyz are bad,"well look at this!! I heard that they are coming out with a TATOO PARLOR... FOR BABYZ!!!! With skulls and flaming hearts and everything!!! And have you looked at the outfits lately???""Babyz Nite Out"" looked like something a hooker would wear!!! And these are REAL quotes from the commercials:""Trouble never looked so cute!""""Babies with BLING!""See what I mean?"
5,Cute and adorable Cloe,"This Cloe adorable. I love her. I have this Cloe and she is the cutest Bratz baby. And shut up, no one cares about Shelly, we care about this Bratz baby so go away."
1,Boo Hoo!!!,What a waste of money! It's stupid! I have a 1-year old daughter named Cali and I can't let her play with it because of the small parts! Boo Hoo!!!
2,Not for younger kids,"As an aunt who spoils her niece silly, I thought I would get big kudos buying this doll for my 7 year old niece for Christmas since it was the only thing she really wanted. Unfortunately, both she and I have received more teasing than I expected. The doll does indeed wear what appears to look like a thong. This is something to which today's teenagers have become accustomed but I still find it inappropriate for younger children. My family could not help but tease me for buying something so inappropriate but my niece took it personally. She called in tears saying, ""my doll has a thong!"" Needless to say, I never wanted to hear my sweet niece say the word thong. Now for her birthday I have been instructed to find pants or a diaper for her doll. I don't think this diminishes the quality of the doll for older kids but I want those buying the doll for younger kids to know before buying."
1,Gross and Disturbing,"Why would I want my ""baby"" doll to appear older than me? The fact that she is wearing a thong is actually a little bit scary to me. Why did the manufactuor create a baby doll to portrayed in such a sexual, x-rated way? The concept behind this doll just seems creepy and disturbing to me. I am 13 years old."
1,Ugh,"I'm sorry, but this doll is gross. She isn't cute at all. And neither are most of the Bratz dolls. I would recommend them for a collector or an older child, but reality check... these dolls look like BRATZ (hence the name). Since when was it cool and attractive to be like that!!! At least Barbie has class."
1,Beware: thong-wearing baby doll!,"Yes, the doll is pretty cute but the Cloe doll I just bought for my 5-year-old neice was wearing a short jean skirt with see through black thongs underneath! Believe me, I was not the only one at the party to find this disturbing."
3,UMMM......WHERE ARE HER PANTS????,"OKAY SO SHE'S A CUTE DOLL. AND SHE HAS NEAT ACCESSORIES. BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT BRATZ DOLLS NEVER WEARING ANY PANTS/BOTTOMS???? I KNOW SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A BABY BUT COME ON! NO BABY I EVER KNEW WORE HER BOTTLE ON A METAL CHAIN AROUND HER NECK. OR HAD SUCH 'GROWN-UP"" FEATURES. PLEASE GUYS AT LEAST PUT SOME PANTS ON THE POOR THING!!!!!!"
5,BRILL OR WHAT!!!!,I like this toy. This is the only bratz babyz thing I have and if I could I would give it a million stars. Firstly she is beauiful with stort bouncy hair. Next her cute little pig even though one eye is bigger than the other. I really like her play mat with her blue trim and soft fabic in the middle. I also like her flower bag.
1,Very Disturbed,I can not believe this doll! I think it is wrong to make a baby look like a sex symbol and I would never buy this for a child. To top it off they have extra outfits like fish net tights!!!! For a Baby!!!!! Sorry but it is very upsetting to me. I would actually give this toy zero stars but it was not an option1
4,Very cute!,"This doll is very cute, and fun. She is well detailed and good for all ages, as long as you take her earrings out if you give her to a younger child. I'm in my early teens, and i still collect dolls! Cloe has beautiful blue eyes and corn coloured hair. I think this was a very smart idea, also. I'm planning on making clothes and accessories for her, also. I have Babyz Jade, too, and i want to get Fianna next! I'm sure if you buy this doll, you'll love her!"
3,Not a very good toy,"I think that this Baby Bratz dolls are strange (cute,but strange)They even made a MOTOR BIKE FOR BABYS!And they are makeing them dress like teens!And they have a chain!MGA is craaaaaazy!"
1,bratz babyz???????????????,most babys don't care for pretty clothes or fashon.and most babys don't walk around in woman under where they where diapers!.to me thes dolls are growing up too fast I hate to be there mom!.
3,Just another toy to pick up!,"My daughter loves Bratz, and had to have this toy. It is cute and she loves it, but for me it's just another toy I have to pick up off the floor before my little boy finds it and shoves it in his mouth. It's great for older girls, but not so great if you have small ones crawling about."
5,IF A NINE YEAR OLD'S FACE LIGHTS UP - IT's GREAT !,"That says it all.......my 9 yo granddaughter just loved the doll. She prefers the smaller (can travel easy) dolls. Make a child happy, order one or more.........By the way, as a Granny, I think the name (BRATZ) of the doll sucks and a couple might be dressed a little risque. I didn't buy those."
4,Cool Doll,"I have Bratz Babyz dolls Phobe,Roxxi,Meygan, and Yasmin. Cloe's blonde pigtails snap in and out of her head very easily. She comes with a fuzzy pig that is pink,a pink and green diaperbag, and a pink blanket with blue fur trim. I love this doll. On my other Bratz Babyz dolls I found that sometimes their legs and arms bend off when chaging clothes. But overall a really nice doll."
1,No thank you!,The Bratz Baby line is what made me decide to stop purchasing Bratz merchandise for my stepdaughter. I find the implicit messages that they convey to be both detrimental and extremely disturbing.
2,Bland beyond belief,"The urban-dance drama, ""How She Moves,"" springs to life only when its high-energy, talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera. Otherwise, this stale strive-suffer-and-succeed story is low on energy, low on originality, and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other likeminded films that have come before it.Rutina Wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner-city youngster who finds that the best way for her to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step-dance competitions, but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screenwriting and undistinguished direction. As noted earlier, the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing, but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting."
4,delivery fine,i have nothing negative to spread about condition or delivery of said movie and if thats what the review is to be all about-than i guess i'll leave this seller a good sound and say if another meet up comes by...i have no problem buying anything.
3,Not as Hype as I thought,The movie was good overall but the story line was a little whack. It kind of kept going back and forth with her betraying this person then helping that person yadyadyada. Still it had some decent dance moves and decent music and was not a bad movie to watch on a Friday night with my girl
2,Move Outta Here!,"Memo to Hollywood - this train has done gone through the station...several times. Apparently, there's still an audience for interesting dancing wrapped around predictable, repetitive storylines.In my day, it was Dirty Dancing (which wasn't that great either IMHO). I'd prefer to see a pure dance vid or documentary rather than fast-forwarding through the ""story"" to get to the juicy parts. For the record, Me No Like How She Move."
1,all looks and no quality,"This phone is pleasing to the eye, but I found that this phone was too clunky. When holding this phone on your shoulder, you may end up hanging up on the person. The talk button sticks out in a way that its easy to hang up with a slight touch of your ear. My roomate had this phone at college and didn't find it handy at all. I would have liked to have a redial button too. Sound quality was bad once I walked in to the next room as well. I don't recommend buying this phone."
3,Sometimes there's static,"We use this in our lab...when moving from one room to the next, there's some static, but that may also be due to the large equipment in the rooms. Who knows?"
5,Fantastic fix,"I drive for a machine shop delivering parts for the customers. Sometimes the loads get pretty heavy. One time I had a delivery and didn't realize there was a return load. The load severely overloaded the truck. I took my time driving home but a couple of times the truck bottomed out. After returning home I discovered the shocks were both gone leaking oil. I installed new shocks and this kit to prevent more trouble. Well I never knew how well these helper springs are. No matter what the load, small, medium, heavy, just adjust the air pressure to the load and the truck performs like it was empty. I'll never own another pickup without a set of these air springs in it. Only detriment is they advertise 1 hour installation and for a backyard mechanic like me it took four hours, but not a hard job. Highly recommend."
1,I will not buy ANY product made by this company,"I bought the toothpaste and there were some weird green fibers in there. My dog sniffed at it and turned his head away. So I called the manufacturer,(800)338-3659, to ask them what the green fibers were. They did send a pick-up for lab test but later never returned my phone call when I asked for the result (I called many times. When I called this company no one ever answers the phone. I don't know if it's going out of business or what. But I wouldn't dare to purchase any more product from this company."
5,Licking good!,"Both my dogs love this product. They recently had some dental problems and my vet told me to start brushing their teeth to avoid problems in the future. I was afraid they'd resist because I had never tried to brush their teeth before (one is 6 years old and the other is 4). They took to the brushing immediately, primarily because they liked the taste of the toothpaste. Hopefully, we'll have better dental checkups in the future."
1,Holy moly,"I could go on and on about the faults in this game. but I played College hoops and this game and honestly this game is just flat out amazingly bad. There are honestly too many wrong things with this game, it just seems like EA Sports stopped trying on this franchise altogether. TERRIBLE GAME!"
1,EA screws up again,"ESPN College Hoops 2K5 is overall a much better game this year than March Madness 2005. I suggest that you should buy College Hoops 2K5 instead. These are the reasons why:1. You can only edit the names of 325 players in the game. That's only 27 teams that you can completely edit! This really takes away from the game if you can't name all the players you want to.2. The computer's defense recovers too quickly when you force a turnover, making fast breaks nearly impossible to get.3. The graphics are not up to par in this game and are nothing compared to ESPN College Hoops 2K5. It's time for EA to update their graphics for their college games.4. The discipline system for dynasty mode has an insane amount of players getting in trouble. This is even more of a problem in this game than it was in NCAA Football 2005.5. The game is basically NBA Live with college teams. There's no difference between the 2 games, gameplay wise.6. College Hoops 2k5 is $20 cheaper."
3,Get ready to outscore your opponet.,"You better get ready to play Dallas Mavericks' type ball with this game because nobody misses. With this game I was a little disappointed because it is nothing like college hoops. College hoops is about defense and stopping a team from scoring when it counts. In this edition, every team has 2 or 3 players who rarely miss from 3 point range making defense pretty much useless. Like NBA Live 2005, layups and dunks are blocked way too easily and fouls are too touchy. Overall I was not really impressed. It looks like EA Sports just copied NBA Live and put March Madness on the cover."
2,adequate at best,"I will admit that I bought the silver version of this phone/answering machine because it looked pretty. However, its performance is another story. There is a low but audible buzz coming from the unit that can be heard as background noise in my greeting. When I called my sister from this phone, she said she couldn't hear me as well as usual and that my voice sounded a little choppy, almost digitized (although I could hear her perfectly). I find it disconcerting to use the phone because when I speak, my voice is amplified in the earpiece; but when I pause in between sentences, it sounds like the line has gone dead. On the positive side, the unit is easy to operate and has some nice features like message retrieval from the handset. The sound quality of incoming messages is much improved over my standalone GE answering machine. The range of the phone seems pretty good and the unit takes up minimal space. But overall, I would not recommend this system."
1,"Short life span, no customer service","The life span of the battery and the charger itself is short. I purchased one of these, lasted 3 mo. The retailer replaced it for us (even though they didn't have to) and the replacement lasted only a few months more before the battery died. We replaced the battery (BYW, we followed instructions on charging & battery maintaince to the letter) only to have the battery charger in the base die. Calls to customer service were fruitless. Automated 800 number had no option for troubleshooting our problem and referred us to a toll number (317 AC) that had the exact options as the 800 no. No option of talking to an actual person. You should know that GE doesn't make its own phones but subs manufacture out to a company called Thomson Electronics. There is no phone no. given to call GE directly, I guess because its your problem not theirs, or web site reference for either GE or Thomson. Anyone would be nuts to buy any GE phone product."
2,I returned the phone.,"We have a GE cordless phone that worked fine for us but we wanted a phone with all the options this phone came with, so I thought this phone would fit the bill. I found the connection faded while talking on the phone even though the phone was fully charged. The phone was comfortable against my ear when talking but it wasn't worth it when the connection faded while talking to someone. I returned the phone and bought a different brand."
2,Buttons on handset don't work well,"The phone has decent functionality and one would think that a GE product would be reliable, but we've been frustrated by the buttons on the handset, which quickly became unreliable. One has to mash on the ""3"" button repeatedly to get it to register, and the ""redial"" button is useless. This is not a matter of wear and tear because we hardly ever used the redial button.Another design flaw: if you scroll through the caller ID list and then press ""dial"" for a long-distance call, the call fails because the phone isn't smart enough to put ""1"" before the 10-digit number! It seems pretty idiotic for a major company not to realize the long-distance numbers require a ""1"" first."
2,Good for shorter duration of time,"As stated by <<electronics fan from Gaithersburg, MD United States >>,I faced the ""same problem"" just after the 1 year Warranty period expired :(The phone has decent functionality and one would think that a GE product would be reliable, but we've been frustrated by the buttons on the handset, which quickly became unreliable. One has to mash on the ""3"" button repeatedly to get it to register, and the ""redial"" button is useless. This is not a matter of wear and tear because we hardly ever used the redial button."
2,Also had trouble with keypad,"Sturdy, pleasant-looking phone that functioned well for more than a year -- however, now, the ""Talk"" button no longer works, and some of the number keys are also difficult, sometimes registering a number twice, or not at all. If they would have fixed this flaw - seems to be widespread after reading other reviews - it would be a fine phone. Good timing on GE's behalf - phone goes downhill just as the warranty expires."
1,Frustrating,Works when it works... so many times I have had to reboot the device. Or my computer. Or both.
5,Best Album/CD of All Time,"I have thousands of recordings (both vinyl & CD) and there isn't a single one which I and my wife have consistenly listented to time and time again and still love it just as much as the first time. We must have heard it by now hundreds of times and the music on it never fails to amaze with its power and elegance. I have every album the band ever recorded and I like them all, even the earlier stuff with Syd Barrett which a lot of people consider too weird. However, we both consider this not only BY FAR the best album Pink Floyd ever did, it's the best recording of all time. Underrated by far, it stands above Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall and other great albums. I can't say enough about how much we both love this music!!!"
3,stick with the original,"The three star rating is for sound quality only (5 stars obviously for music). I spent $30 on this cd hoping for something in quality along the lines of the impossible to find gold discs. Based on everyone's recommendations, I assumed this would be a good choice. Wrong! I have a high end system and after playing both the original release and this copy side by side several times, I am unable to notice a significant difference (if any). ..."
4,For the completist,"Made in EU in 2000, Serial# 5-29071-2, Playing Time 44:11This review won't talk about the music on this album; you know what it's worth!This limited edition was released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of WYWH, first published in 1975.The remastering job is the same as for the ""Shine On"" release, but the packaging somewhat recreates the original release (even though the postcard is a bit different.)If you don't have any ""remastered"" version of this classic album, this is THE ONE to get."
5,glad this is here,"pink floyd's most sublimely beautiful album becomes an even more fulfilling experience when heard remastered using sbm 16 bit digital on a high quality disc. all of the original album art is also digitally enhanced for spectacular clarity and this package in particular is the most faithfull to the original lp compared to other releases of ""wish you were here"". this record is dave gilmour's favorite floyd album and the subtlety of the layering in the recording , along with floyd's most overall positive compositions make it clear why. listen over and over-you'll find something new every time , especially with this superior remaser."
2,"Velcro Usa 90440 Velstrap Strap with handle, Black",The velcro fell off the end the first time I used it. Once i fixed the product it was nice but I had to sew the velcro end strip back on.
4,It is a good music .,"I found ""Andre Gagnon"" CD had a long time. In our country much program use ""Andre Gagnon"" music to background. Let it becomes beautiful and beautiful in program . I am poor at English. Hope everyone can know my mind."
1,"Watched it, wasted my time and money",This DVD was more the self glamorazation of the guy who made the DVD than it was about New Orleans.I was born and raised in New Orleans and wanted to see what happened to the city. All this DVD showed was the mugging face of some wannabe movie producer.I quit watching about halfway through.
5,ROSS FINALLY MAKES IT TO THE TOP,"This is a great CD!...From cut 1-12 all the way through. This is the 1st time in a long time that Diana has been consistent. This LP could be a huge smash. But, Already MOTOWN HAS YET TO PROMOTE THIS CD, THERE IS NO SINGLE OFFICIALLY AND MOST EMBARRASING NO VIDEO!!!!! AND THE ONLY RELEASE IS THE VINYL (gasP) OF ""Until We Meet Again"". I AM URGING ALL FANS OF DIANA TO WRITE TO MOTOWN'S A&R DEPARTMENT DEMANDING THAT THEY PUT SOME MONEY BEHIND THIS PROJECT."
5,The Boss Is Back!,"All i can say is....WOW! Diana Ross is at her best (as usual). It's been 4 long years since her last release, and it's been well worth the wait. From the opening track ""He Lives In You"" (from The Lion King II) , to the closing HOT remixes of the Beautiful, heart wrenching ballad..Until We Meet Again"", you are in total awe of how one artist could consistantly outdo herself after 35 years of making great music! Everysong on this CD has HIT written all over it. Amazing set of beautiful ballads and Dance tunes from THE DIVA of all Divas! Diana has never sounded better! Give this CD a listen...I'm sure you won't regret it! I haven't taken this CD out of my CD Player since I bought it on the 4th of May..."
3,There's a hidden bonus dance track!,"Track 12, the Hex Hector mix of Until We Meet Again, is followed by the Love to Infinity dance mix of the same song about 15 seconds later. These, along with Soul Solution's mix of Carry On are the only dance songs on the album. Hopefully, there will be several singles from the album that are remixed for club consumption."
5,"As usual, with Miss Ross, a treasure from beginning to end!","Diana Ross is a truly inspirational vocalist, but this time she not only topped herself but everyone else as well. ""Everyday Is A New Day"" is the quintessential of all of her past albums ranking up there with ""Take Me Higher"". It's a sure multi-platinum #1 SMASH!"
5,HOT!,"Diana Ross is back and in a big way! This latest album is one of her best and can easily be defined as brilliant! Her songs are the in the same groove as chart toppers that are half her age. However, when you listen to this new, HOT cd you will clearly see why ROSS is the original DIVA!"
4,"Cool, Diana...very cool!!!","I should have rated this CD b4. I need to say that NO SINGERS VOICE STAYS THE SAME. NO SINGER CAN STAY ONE TOP FOREVER. There will always be a time when a project is ""not as good"" as the others. BRITNEY, ALICIA AND OTHERS WILL FIND THAT OUT...SOON ENOUGH!!Ross has been singer singing a long time. (Thank God) This cd shows a softer and more mature side of Ross. ""Everyday's A New Day"", 'Sugarfree"", ""Carry On"", ""Love Is All That Matters"" are truly great songs. There are UK remixes of a few of this songs but the ABSOLUTE GREATEST REMIX is ""Not Over You Yet'. If you can find it, BUY IT WITHOUT QUESTION!!!Ross made this cd during/after her divorce from her last husband. i can hear the direction of this album and I GET IT. This cd should have received more airplay than it did. ""Sugarfree' got some attention and others should have as well/Its a good cd. THANKS, DIANA!!!"
4,The Lady is Back,"I waited 4 long years since the release of the sadly unappreciated ""Take Me Higher"" for a new Diana Ross record. When it came, upon my first listen, I was a little disappointed. I now have to say, I've changed my opinion. I believe this her best album since ""Red Hot R&B"" in 1987. Although not as cohesive as, say, ""The Force Behind the Power"" (1991) Diana manages to grab and hold your attention on nearly every track. Her voice has never been more clear(""He Lives in You"") confident(""Carry On"") or moving(""Someone That You Loved Before""). Although I still think that ""Gone"", off TMH is still her best 90's ballad. This album is just an incredible display of her talent. Motown REALLY dropped the ball with this one. Fortunately, their abuse hasn't discouraged Diana from continuing, but how much more of this can she take?"
2,Every Day is a Another Day for Diana to Try Again!,"As a tremendous fan of Diana Ross, I was once again disappointed with her latest effort, Every Day is A New Day. While the writing is pretty good and Diana is in fine voice, her material simply is not worthy of her talent. She needs to find a strong producer who will pull the performance out of her and maybe a new label. Motown is not giving her the promotion and material she needs at this point in her career. I always buy her latest album hoping for the magic, but her last few releases have not been very good. Stop managing yourself Diana and get some new production!"
1,A generous rating.....dreadful!,"Diana Ross was once the darling of my record player. Even at her worst, there was a sense of at least a ""star"" who could kind of sing. Diana Ross at her worst, this time, showcases little except for a lot of contemporary songwirters and producers trying to re-invent Ross once again with mercilessly insipid songs and boring production. One would think Ross would have some artistic integrity after 36 years in the business. Its is all lost with this depressingly dreadful album."
1,waste of money!!!,"I'm not a drag Queen but I bought it. And, yes I regret it. It's a waste of money from beginning to end !! One track is still ok....Not over you yet. The rest of the album is BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD !!!"
1,Don't buy this !,"Diana Ross has released once again an album that is not worth listening to. Just like Take Me higher this is Diana trying to be modern and hip and it just doesn't work ! Even the Metro team ( responsible for Tina Turner's smash hit ""When the heartache is over"" and Cher's ""Believe"" ) can not change this. There is only one song worth listening to on this album and that's ""Not over you yet"". Spend your money wiser and buy Aretha's ""A Rose is still a Rose"" or Tina's ""Twenty Four Seven"". These ladies have a voice !"
1,questionable diva,"I don't understand the fascination with Diana Ross. She has an average voice at best but yet she is put on a pedestal as some kind of Diva. She can't sing like Aretha, she can't belt like Patti Labelle and she dosen't have the vocal range of Whitney Houston. But when divas are mentioned and great singers she is at the top of the list. I am usually in aggreement when there are good singers but ever since I was little I just didn't see how Diana could stand out let alone make a life-long career with her whiny, thin, voice. Would someone please enlighten me I'm confused?"
3,15 years too late!,"If this album was released in the mid 1980's it would have been a sure fire worldwide hit. It would have elevated Diana's career even higher instead she decided to release a load of pap from 1982 to 1992 and in doing so, sabotaged her own career. Diana's vocals on this album are immpecable - they're smooth, assured, sensual and strong, but this listener can't help but feel that most of the lyrics on this album are trite. There are a few tracks that stand out - the title track Every Day Is A New Day, Hope Is An Open Window, Carry On and Until We Meet Again; the rest of the album just sinks into mediocrity. In saying that, this album is far superior to anything she released in the 80's, but for the 90's it just doesn't cut the mustard. I would love to see Diana Ross on top of the charts again with a top selling album and hit singles, but this album just doesn't deliver. C'mon Diana, pull your finger out before it's too late!"
3,Too many ballads.,"I expected more up-tempo songs. Too many ballads. ""Carry On"" great but Martha Wash's version a lot better."
5,NOT OVER DIANA YET!,"The latest album from Diana Ross is one of the freshest, touching, and supreme album from Diana Ross in years. The songs are soothing and carefree, while some on the album are moving and emotional. If you like songs with a message of hope, love, and fun...Diana Ross delivers. Just SUPREME!!!!"
2,Until Diana Try Again,"The mix of ""Until We Meet Again"" will do for Diana what ""Unbreak My Heart"" did for Toni Braxton. I only wished the whole cd were as agressive and contemporary as this last cut, unfortunately is not and it is a disappointment."
4,Rediscover Diana,"EDIAND definitely ranks high among the CD's from Diana Ross of the 90's. It's a shame that it didn't get the airplay it deserved. It's great how it builds from He Lives In You, Love Is All That Matters, and Until We Meet Again to the more soulful/R & B tracks like Got To Be Free, Not Over You Yet, the title track, and Sugarfree. Her voice sounds in top form and seems stronger than ever. Diana doesn't disappoint her true fans and will welcome new fans, young and old, with this release. It's classic Diana with an updated sound. I appreciate the fact that she's willing to try new and different material, yet remaining true to herself. If you haven't heard from Diana in awhile, rediscover her with this excellent CD; you won't be disappointed."
1,Diana could do much better,"Diana needs to get a producer to put her back on track. This entire album needs to be remixed!! Only the Hex Hector remixes of ""Until We Meet Again"" display the standard Diana used to have. This collection will not be jump-starting her career."
2,Diana Ross Tries Again,"Whenever there is a new Diana Ross album, there is always a flurry of publicity around it, and this effort is no different except that it doesn't quite warrant all the hoopla. Ms. Ross has once again tried to be hip and trendy with her music rather than thoughtful about it. She scores best on tracks like SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVED BEFORE and UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN while NOT OVER YOU YET is also a decent entry but surprisingly sounds like it doesn't belong on this album. Ms. Ross could indeed return to the top of her craft if she went back to being the Diana of the seventies and early eighties and stopped trying to emulate Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and even Macy Gray. So while EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY is not a bad album, it is a dull one and Ms. Ross's fans will be happy with it if only for its presence in the pop world."
2,Terribly dissapointing entry by a great talent,"This is a distressingly dull set of cookie-cutter songs that are enlivened only with Ross' clear and supple vocals. The album starts out promisingly with the arresting ""He Lives in You,"" complete with tribal back-up vocals. The rest of the album sags, until the interesting ""Hope Is an Open Window."" These two very good songs are lost, however in the rest of the album, which is basically a collection of filler."
1,HELP!!!!!,"WHEN DIANA ROSS PERFORMED ON THE MOTOWN SPECIAL AND ASK SOMEBODY HELP ME, NO ONE HAS DONE IT YET. THIS ALBUM IS LIKE THE WORST. THE SONGS WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER, IF SOMEONE WITH A VOICE LIKE PATTI LABELLE OR NATALIE COLE HAD DONE THEM. MS. ROSS YOU ARE A GREAT ACTRESS AND YOU REALLY SHOULD STICK TO ACTING. DIANA HAS NEVER BEEN A GREAT SINGER AND AFTER YOU HEAR THIS ALBUM YOU WILL SEE THE VOICE HAS BECOME WEAKER THAN WHAT IT ALREADY WAS. I RECOMMEND DONNA SUMMER'S ""LIVE AND MORE ENCORE"" AND NATALIE COLE'S ""SNOWFALL ON THE SAHARA."" THESE TWO LADIES ARE REAL SINGERS."
3,Great voice!,"Daina sounds good. I only like half the song on the CD. Songs like ""Not Over You"" and ""Everyday"" are so repetative that I just want to change the song. ""Love Is All That Matters"" and ""Someone That You Loved Before"", is Diana at her BEST! I Do like ""He Lives In You"" but seems to be missing something in the middle. For a Dance tune, I will go with ""Carry On"" over ""Until We Meet Again Remix"", which should be left a ballet.Berry,help!"
1,"CHER, PLEEEEEEEEEEZ SAVE MISS ROSS!!!!!!","This is the last album ever made by Diana of new material,and the worst. The songs are dull, boring and unmemorable.What ever happened to Diana Ross of ""Upside Down"" and ""The Boss""??? While CHER is still burning up the charts and theclub scene at 56, and she still shines like a grand diva should,once you get out of rehab Miss Has-Been Ross, think of allthe damage you have done, all the people you have hurt overthe years, and you better come up with something to regainyour fans and your career. This last album, and the fake Supremesreunion didnt do it.Dont get me wrong, Diana is a great talent and legend, but maybe that was the Diana Ross of many, many, many YEARS ago.Dont waste your money on this one....mine has been collecting dust for over 3 years now, i dont even know where it is."
1,Every other album was a better album.,"This is a monotonous album in its own nature. All the songs are slow, no rhythmic sounds to awake!. When your baby cry, and doesn't get sleep, you can use it, I recommend it."
5,Outstanding,"This cd is incredible. Everytime I think that Ms. Ross has reached her peaked she releases new material that out does the previous releases. When you think that she is 55 years and has been in the business for a long time she has so much enthusiasm. Her voice is fresh, clear and pure. She can sing the lyrics like no other diva getting to the soul of every word. It's a shame that her record company, Motown, does not promote her more and the dj's are missing her music on the radio. Here is a tip: I have seen her in concert several times and let me tell you she knocks the other divas ""out of the water"". She is trully magic in person!"
3,Mixed Feelings on EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY,"As a die-hard Ross fan, I have eagerly awaited this new CD from the legendary diva. I had expected Diana's usual blend of beautiful ballads and dance music, reminiscent of her ""Take Me Higher"" album of 95, which was terrific and had been her best in recent years. However, I have mixed feelings for her latest effort--a collection of mid-tempo ballads and inspirational songs, with only 2 dance tracks in this collection. Diana's voice is as beautiful as ever, but many of the songs never seem to hit their full stride because either they lack that ""hook,"" which pulls you in, or suffer from lackluster arrangement and orchestration. Better material-- like black velvet--is deserving for a diamond like Diana, to make her really shine. --Chris Greene"
3,The voice of the Motown generation continues to deliver,"....but, the selections on this latest CD disappoint. Diana has a multitude of gifts - voice, showmanship, STYLE. What a powerful combination when she aligns these gifts with empowering messages through her songs. While the voice will NEVER disappoint, the combined selections on the CD have too heavy of a theme that I sum up as a chronicle of painful separation/divorce and the struggle to survive. Come-on Diana! - bring some of the 60-70-80's magic into the 90's!"
5,The brilliance of Diana Ross,"My collection of Diana Ross music is extensive. Yes the RCA years were more pop than soul, but her latest recording of ""Every Day Is A New Day"" is an examlpe of great music performed by a legendary artist. I especially enjoy listening to the third track(Until We Meet Again). Since the summer tour--RTL was canceled before it reached the MCI Center, in Washington, DC. This new cd has helped to to deal with my disappointment. In addition, there is the eight track (Sugarfree)which is produced by Chuckii Booker. I would be remiss if I didn't nention track number ten (Hope Is An Open Window), the use of the literary work of Sonia Sanchez brings both a power and depth to this song. I for one do not need radio to tell me what is good music. Diana's latest video has never been played on BET (except when she received her star). Do yourself a favor, put on track number eleven and CARRY ON."
4,Good CD,Bought this as a gift for someone that is still enjoying it daily. I heard a few songs and they were exceptional.
4,Surprisingly Fresh and Alive,"It takes a few listens to appreciate the CD, but Diana still sounds great and her selection of songs is eclectic but it works. Highlights are Love is All That Matters, He Lives in You and the remix (and hidden bonus) of Until We Meet Again. Definitely worth every cent!"
2,diana is capable of better songs,"i am rather disappointed by diana's latest release. i was hoping that she would record better songs...what she lacks in this album is the help of better producers like david foster, jimmy jam and terry lewis or babyface. although lyric wise they seem to be rather meaningful, there should be better melodies. outstanding tracks i feel are 'until we meet again' 'not over you yet'."
2,"All you have to do is dream, dream, dream.","It was a surprise for me. Diana is back to Motown. A come back to this past glory seal does not mean success now. If she wants to sing blues, this CD must specify it is almost about this mood, I can heard one or two, but twelve is much more for me."
1,Unfortunately...,"I was thoroughly disappointed by this release. There were far too many slow tracks, and the songwriting was, for the majority of the songs, quite mediocre. For someone with the reputation of Ms. Ross, she should be making better albums. Her last one, ""Take Me Higher,"" was even more disappointing, so this album is a step in the right direction... barely. Her voice sounds great, but honestly, she needs to work with producers that get the emotion out of her and into her singing. It makes no sense to me that the first single released from this album is a remix of an album cut, tacked on at the end of an album which should have every other song remixed as well. Too bad she didn't capitalize on the dance music trend... her cover of ""I Will Survive"" on the last album was fantastic, and an album of cuts like that (a la Cher) would have been amazing. Sorry, Ms. Ross, as much as I'd like to say good job, I just cannot."
1,The Worst Album Of Her Career,"I am one of Diana Ross' biggest fans yet I can find few good things about this new CD. Four songs: Until We Meet Again, Love Is All That Matters, Someone That You Loved Before, and Carry On are vintage Ross at her best. The rest are dreary lifeless urban dirges that have no energy and bury her incredible voice in stale productions. Even He Lives In You never picks up any steam. It is sad that fans of Miss Ross have waited four long years for this."
4,A very powerful book with 4 stories making up the whole.,"This is not a book for light reading. It has 4 stories involving 4 elements of earth. Each elemental story has a central character descended from the first, each element involves a powerful story of nature. A very good read that affected me and how I perceive what we're doing to our world, which, I believe, was the authors point."
2,The Elementals,"This is not the best of works by this author. The format for linking stories together utilizing time and elements as a thread was a good technique. However, the stories had little to do with one another. Never the less, I still found the book worth reading."
2,Really 2 and a half stars,"The first two stories in the book are very well written, and I had no problems at all finishing them. In fact, it was hard to stop reading until I hit the third story. From that point on, the book went on a downward spiral. If possible, I recommend borrowing the book from a friend and sticking to the first half of the novel. You won't miss much by skipping the last half."
5,Love this Workout!,I've been doing Pilates for a couple years now with another DVD and heard about the Cardio Flow option on More Than Mat Pilates and gave the Beginning DVD a try. I absolutely LOVE IT! It's great that the Cardio Flow option let's you do the workout straight through without all the stopping and starting there is in other DVD's. I can't wait to buy the Intermediate DVD!!!
2,Way too easy,"I have been doing Pilates a couple of times a week for about a year. I mostly do DVDs but I wish I could afford to take classes where you work on the reformer. I figured the second best would be to do this video where they incorporate exercises from the reformer. I started with the beginner version and planned to work up to the harder ones, but that may have been a mistake. The problem is that the exercises are so easy that I don't feel a thing and they don't work my body at all. I don't have the time to do an exercise DVD that doesn't even do anything. I now wish I'd bought the intermediate or the advanced instead, maybe one of those would have been better. I would recommend that if you have some experience with Pilates, you should not buy this DVD."
3,Kinda Boring,This DVD is really kind of ho-hum. Sarah goes through the moves but it has a whole surreal feel to it. The DVD does not last long enough for you to get a good feeling like you are actually working something. This is a great DVD if you want to start off at the bottom of the physical fitness ladder but not so great if you have any core muscles whatsoever.
4,"Good, but lacking a few things.","The music on this CD is just beautiful! Just listening to it will take you to everyone's favorite galaxy ""far, far away."" Includes soaring melodies like ""Anakin's Theme"" along with powerful selections like, ""Duel of the Fates.""However, I was a bit disappointed with this CD. Following the excellent releases of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition soundtracks, this is a big let-down. First of all, not all the music is present. (While watching the movie I noticed a few selections they decided to leave out.) Plus, it doesn't follow the layout of the movie like the Special Editions did.All in all, a great collection, essential for the Star Wars fan, and anyone else who loves great music."
1,UGH!,"This is, BY FAR, the worst soundtrack that John Williams has ever created. It seems like there is total lack of swashbuckling crescendos as there was in The Empire Stikes Back. Granted the movie was totally awful, poorly made complete with terrible acting and forgettable characters. VERY FORGETTABLE. Sometimes the music makes the movie...well the opposite is noted here. My suggestion to Mr. Williams: If the next Star Wars sucks like Episode 1, look for a better story to match your talents as one of the greatest composers. If you choose to stay, May the force be with you."
4,"again, two thumbs up!","john williams has created yet another music masterpiece, yet it lacks some of the magic that made the original star wars trilogy so special. in the original saga almost every main character has its own theme, yet here only anakin and the stupid jar jar binks have one. what happened to queen amidala, or obi wan kenobi? also, this is like a compressed score of the music that is present in the film. the music in the CD is not in the same order as it appears in the movie, and is like each song is summarized. anyway, my favorites picks are anakin's theme, droid invasion and the appereance of darth maul, duel of the fates, and qui gon's noble end(which is actually the movie version of duel of the fates, since ""duel"" only appears on the end credits and is not actually an scene song)."
5,I want sheet music for this one!,When I bought this soundtrack I wasn't sure what to expect. I had heard Duel of the Fates on MTV and was just totally blown away. :) I loved how Williams incorporated a piece of the Imperial March into the music and how another piece which I don't know the name of was incorporated as well. I'll be heading off to the music store to look up sheet music for this one. Gotta add it to my Empire Strikes Back medley. :)
3,Great music to sleep by!,"I bought this CD because I am a Mahler scholar, and the CD bases all of its material on bits and pieces of the third movement of Gustav Mahler's Fourth Symphony. While I am fascinated that this group chose a Classical work to rewrite and de-construct in this way, I found the several ""variations"" on the piece a little boring. On the other hand, I am not a fan of New Age music, but of Classical music. If you want to sleep, or to relax, this is the CD for you! You can just feel smug that you are listening to Classical music at the same time."
1,I'm casting a vote contrary to others,"I checked this book out from my library because of my interest in the Holocaust.I must weigh in with the one other reviewer who didn't like the book. It was flat, without motivation (unless you consider the lead character's life-long infatuation with her cousin). I didn't like the flip-flopping back and forth with no warning. I never developed a sense of caring about any of the characters.This book might be a fresh look at the story of Naomi and Ruth, but it doesn't register with the same sincerity or depth as the original.I cannot recommend this book."
1,DON'T BE SO QUICK TO BOOK EDGAR HOOVER,"THIS IS A MASTERPIECE OF LEFTIST UN-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA INTENDED TO DESTROY THE GOOD NAME OF ONE OF THE GREATEST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY, AS WELL AS TO ASSASSINATE THE GOOD CHARACTER OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR NATION AS G-MEN AND G-WOMEN SINCE THE AGENCY WAS ESTABLISHED 80 YEARS AGO. MR. HOOVER ESTABLISHED THE HIGH STANDARDS OF BEING A FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT. THE F.B.I. HAS A REPUTATION OF BEING SECOND TO NONE IN EVERYTHING THE AGENCY IS INVOLVED IN, SUCH AS INVESTIGATING FEDERAL CRIMES, RUNNING A FORENSIC SCIENCE LAB, ASSISTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN SOLVING CRIMES AND INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES POST 9/11. MS. CULLERTON HAS DONE OUR COUNTRY AND THE FINE FEDERAL AGENTS OF THE F.B.I., AND ALL FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, AN ENORMOUS DIS-SERVICE BY HAVING PUBLISHED THIS BOOK. I URGE ANYONE READING THIS NOT TO WASTE THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY IN BUYING THIS BOOK. INSTEAD READ"
2,I didn't love it,"She's Got Handle is an inspiring story. It conveys very important themes, including the idea of a strong family background, hard work, and love. However, I do not believe that the book was very well-written. It used a large amount of slang, and had several grammatical errors. The book also often went off on tangents about irrelevant information. This made the book difficult and tedious to finish."
1,A Song Without Words,"This was one of the worst shows ever to hit Broadway. The songs are so bad that they were eliminated entirely from the movie version even though the movie was obviously intended to be a musical and starred Frank Sinatra and Maurice Chevalier as the son and the father, respectively. I played in the pit for a production of this thing and by the end by the end of the run could barely tolerate going to the theatre each evening. The best ballad, ""I Like You,"" is sung by the son to his father. ""Welcome Home"" sounds promising but isn't addressed to anyone. It continues ""Welcome Home says the chair as I enter in the room...""This is a recording from the '50s and doesn't compare to modern production values.I'd pass."
4,VINTAGE SEINFELD STAND-UP BITS AGE WELL,"For those who saw Jerry's recent HBO special and don't want to be told ""for the last time,"" this stand-up concert from 1987 has some of the same great bits plus many other classic Seinfeldisms. Filmed a few years before his sitcom began, ""Stand-Up Confidential"" contains numerous vintage bits, many of which became entire episodes of ""Seinfeld."" Also of note are vignettes inbetween the stand-up which are funny reenactments of parts of his routine (sounds like the premise of a certain NBC sitcom...). I recommend this video, especially to ""Seinfeld"" fans, which showcases Jerry Seinfeld's comedic talents. END"
1,Book,I got this book for my farther and he could not see itat all.The print is very small and the book is just notlarge print.I was dissipointed when it came and my farthercould not see it.
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"This feeder is wonderful. It's not only beautiful to look at, but the hummers love it too! I can't wait to collect more feeders from Perry's. It is such a joy to watch and it looks like it's made to last with high quality parts. Made in the good ol' USA-that's great too!Thanks Perry's!"
1,"Static from vtech, not from Amazon.","Phone looks good and has all the additions I was looking for.However,as with other VTech phones I have bought (several years agoand never again, I thought they would have fixed their phones by now!), it sounded like I was next to a fully running faucet (static). On the bright side, Amazon.com went above and beyond what you expect from a ""dot com"" vendor. I'll be back, just not for VTech.Mark Spencer END"
1,Never worked right,"I got this phone when I went away to college. It's fine for a first answering machine and cordless phone on a budget. But every once in a while it would start beeping very loudly and uncontrollably in the middle of the night! I would have to pull the battery out of the handset to get it to stop. The outgoing message is very fuzzy and sometimes the handset wouldn't even turn on. If you are looking for quality, look somewhere else."
2,keep looking,"I liked a friend of mine's VTECH 900 mhz phone years ago, so I bought one (the 9060i). Problem is: static and chatter sometimes, even when fully charged; even when I push the ""channel"" button. I live in a dense neighborhood, so maybe that's the problem. Maybe it will work for you if you live on a farm (unless your livestock have cells, so to speak)... You could buy a better phone for less."
5,Highly recommended,A short but very important book. It is a catalog of the known abuses of the Bush administration with good historical prescpective.
5,The time to act is now,"In a clear and concise manner this book examines how the Bush administration has advanced the most aggressive assault against the constitution in our lifetime. Anyone who takes an interest in the affairs of government is already well aware of the various battle fronts, but Mr. Greenwald's careful research and plain spoken exposition make it painfully obvious that president Bush's unchecked power grab is a genuine threat to American democracy.During Nixon's reign the people of this great country had the honesty and common sense to expose his criminal activity and remove him from office. Please act now to eliminate the malignancy that is the Bush administration before it does any more harm."
5,Great book. Good background,I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn more about AML and the background behind the issues we face.
1,Wrong order shipped TWICE!!!!!,"I ordered this product and they sent the wrong battery, from what I ordered. I re-ordered the battery and they AGAIN sent the wrong battery. Neither of these batteries fit into my cell phone and neither of them is the product number that I ordered.Now I have to ship them back at my expense....which is more than what I paid for!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
3,Not that great,"I thought this would help, but it is about the same as the battery that We already had and it is 750 vs 950 amh/omh."
4,decent!,"I bought it for my father-in-law, a big sucker for classic cars. He's currently restoring an 86 Olds 442.He loved it and said he had never seen that exact sign before.Good shipping and quality, well-priced."
3,Reasonably priced - adequate performance,"The Vtech 2 line analog cordless is a great buy if you are looking merely for a bare bones yet fully functional 2 line cordless phone. It has no answerer which primarily accounts for its lower price. It also is an analog version which gives you slightly less clarity than its digital cousins especially over long distances. The VT2960 on the other hand sports an answerer and siginificantly enhanced speech clarity, though the VT9241 significantly makes up in price. A great buy if you want uncluttered usability with the rugged and lasting design of this VT product."
2,"Not a bad phone for the money, but...","For the cost of the phone, the VTech 9241 isn't bad with a reasonable number of features for a basic telephone. The sound quality is actually pretty good except when the 2nd line is in use--no cross talk, but plenty of annoying clicks and ""hits"" that can be heard in the VTech's handset. Ten number memory speed dial memory is inadequate and no speed dial listing on the set or cradle is also big negative. Also, unless you sit on top of the telephone the button descriptions and LEDs for Mute, Conf., Hold, etc. are impossible to see--even from 2' away. If I had it to do over again, I think I would shop a little more."
2,Disappointing performance,"After having bought a Panasonic cordless 2-line phone for my teenage daughter for about $160, I decided to save some money and get this Vtech phone for the kitchen for about half the price. I am sorry. The features work OK, but the sound quality is very disappointing. Our family of five uses the phone a lot, and my father-in-law is hard of hearing. He can't understand us from this phone."
3,Its Pachanga Time!,"This album was produced to capitalize on the short-lived Pachanga craze in New York City during the early 60's. The songwriting basically sounds like the standard latin chord progressions and melodic call and response patterns that Arsenio typically worked with. This album is mostly straight ahead minor key/dominant 7th arrangements. Not much on extended or altered 9ths, 11ths or 13ths, or chord substitution. Really its just the old time Conjunto format played with a Pachanga rhythm. Its not inspiring stuff and its easy to see why it went nowhere commercially (or historically). That being said, if you are an Arsenio Rodriguez fan, there's much to like, including as always Arsenio's tres lines and his songwriting approach. His songwriting style may be way out of date by this time, but I'm still a big fan of the man and his musicianship."
1,NOT SAFE TO SAFEGUARD YOUR VALUABLE FILES,"My 320GB Linkstation failed 3 times in 2 years (returned to manufacturer for replacement twice), each time with all bakup files down to drain. If a storage device that is supposed to backup your valuable files fail before the computer hard drives fail, then what's the purpose of having one? I have dismantled the unit, removed the hard drive (for use as a spare), and discarded its casing and board. Think twice before you buy such model. It is not safe to safeguard your files!"
2,Could not get it to work with external USB drive,"The setup and install of this unit was easy and it all worked great. When you just use the internal drive it is a very good unit.However I returned the Linkstation because I could not get it to work reliably with my external USB drive. When doing large file or directory copies the transfers got interrupted and the copy failed. This was using either my MAC or PC on either wired or wireless connections.I gave up after a long weekend spent on the support web site looking for help, nothing I tried worked."
3,Consumer storage solution,"The Good:This box is loaded with features: ftp, web access, fine-grained access control.Attached to the wireless access point, I now have ubiquitous storage of photos, movies and documents, accessible from any laptop in my house, with a subset accessible though the web also.The Bad:The GUI is pretty slow though and therefore a pain to configure.The fan is kind a loud. Since it is in my bedroom, I frequently turn it off. I've owned it for little over a year now.External drives are limited:* Can only be read in the legacy FAT-32 format or non-microsoft formats.* Cannot be written to in the default (unless formatted in a non-microsoft compatible manner).The OK:Performance is OK. Though it does provide a Gbit network card, the performance is mediocre: I dont get more than 7 MB/sec transfer rates (read) (which is fine for my purpose)."
4,engrossing!,"BEST FRIENDS ARE LIKE SUSPENDERS recounts, in brief glimpses with few detailed explanations, the trials & joys in the lives of two mature women. Bev's second marriage is falling apart while Lin runs a prosperous store, tends to her marriage & keeps in touch with her children ... & then Lacey, her 20 year-old daughter, working with a full-blown AIDS patient, is jostled while drawing blood & the needle lodges in her arm. Now Lacey has to begin to live with AIDS, & so do the two friends.Written tightly & sparsely, we see the unfolding of those last years of Lacey's life. How the mother & friend become involved in AIDS Walks & TIHAN.Rebeccasreads recommends BEST FRIENDS ARE LIKE SUSPENDERS as an absorbing little read, taking you out of your own life & leaving you to ask: ""What would I do when this comes into my life?"""
5,Great sense of place,"I picked up this book based solely on the setting of Namibia. I was simply looking to read some contemporary African fiction.I loved the book. Cleverly written. Orner did a terrific job capturing the sense of place. I could feel the heat and dust as I read. He was able to tell a great tale, very well researched, with good humour. While touching throghout, I found myself laughing at many scenes.Nice job! Go get it and enjoy it."
2,Character sketches in the Namibian veld,"Orner's novel comprises character sketches at an isolated boys' school in the Namibian veld. It's not about plot. The very short chapters--sometimes just a paragraph and at most a couple of pages--are an unusual choice for a novel; they don't really stand alone, but they don't really form a cohesive whole either. Orner does a good job of depicting the various characters through stories they tell each other and the observance of their everyday life--variously touching and humorous. However, those little chapters and characterizations started to wear on me after a while, and I felt I'd had enough long before the end."
4,A unique story.,"Meet larry.A volenter teacher teaching in a ropugh boys school in the heart of the namibian dessert.Her falls in love with beautiful Mavala Shikongo, a teacher from one kintergarden.No matter what people say, they are determined to be together, although there is history and past there.In this tantaslisingly hilarious at sometimes excellent debuet novel, we see love and humor both combined into a unique story witha very well written story line.With his debuet novel,Peter Orner displays love and also raises th question.Should we help far east countries more than we do.An amazing novel from an amazing author.Sam Worral rating:4 stars."
1,Couldn't get past page 60,"After reading the other reviews, I feel a little self conscious and perhaps lacking. But I couldn't get past the writing style of this author and struggled to keep at it, giving up at page 50 or so. I couldn't get interested in the characters and found the whole exposition off putting. I had high hopes, having traveled to Africa 7 times and having Namibia at the top of my list for next to visit. Unfortunately, this book was just a bore that I had to fight hard to get through as far as I did.Some may love the writing style. Just be aware it's very different. I found the staccato made the tale shallow and unapproachable."
5,"""where was heaven""","The single ""where was heaven"" & video made me get [a] copy Syndicate's album wu syndicate the day it came out! From the begining to the end... Wu syndicate hits you with nothing but an real, honest, and excellent production hip hop album! High lights are ""thug war"" , ""metropolis"" , and , ""where was heaven""! Don't think twice and just [get a] copy syndicate's disc called wu-syndicate, alright ? Peace god !!!"
4,CRIME SYNDICATE,"Myalansky, Joe Mafia & Napoleon lyrically hold their weight on this album, an introduction of these Wu-Tang affiliates from Virginia. Production is on point too. My favorite tracks include ""Thug War"", ""Global Politics"" w/ 12 O'Clock, ""VA Cats"",""Golden Sands"", ""Crime Syndicate"" (note: the group's original name), ""Where Was Heaven"" (as featured on The Swarm compilation), ""Weary Eyes"", ""Lutanza"", and ""Bust A Slug"" w/ M.M.O. (another group of Wu-Tang affiliates)."
5,Mobb-Tang Clan,"i bought this joint not excpecting a masterpiece but after a few months i realised it was still in my player.simple,effective loops;good beats and good rhymes.Mobb Deep meets Wu-Tang Clan."
4,Probably the best group to come out of the Wutang label,"I don't listen to Wu-tang or hardcore hip hop that much anymore, even though I have 25 wu related albums, but this is one I still listen to. It's chilled, meaningful and has an original sound given to us by the creator RZA (although don't mention bobby digital). MMO,12 O'Clock, and Joe Mafia pour their hearts out in a style similar to that of recent Ghostface albums. The beats are chilled have a wintry feel about them and some excellent female vocals from Tekitha. The lyrics are a bit depressing but not as hardcore as a Wu-tang clan album. If you are someone that may not listen to tracks as hardcore as ""bring the ruckus"" or methodmans skit (both on Enter the wu-tang clan) this is an enjoyable album. But eventually you'll find fresh new underground hip hop and then you've hit the real good stuff."
4,Best Wu-Album in '99 So far!,Wu Syndicate representing VA and the Wu to the fullest. 18 banging tracks nonstop with no skits. J.Mafia&Myalansky have a tight sound. The Production even without The Rza is nice as well. It's too bad that raw new groups like this one and Killarmy will never get play thanks to fake rap like Puff&Mase.
1,This movie defines bad film making,"It's unbelievable that even bothered to make this movie. The story line, video graphy, editing and acting all set a new low."
1,Heed the previous warning!,The rental price was too much for this waste of time. Unless you are desperate for something with gay content avoid this mess.
4,Not a bad guide,"Having used and owned many prima strategy guides, this one was not quite up to par with the others. Prima is known for having charts saying where to find unique items and where to encounter specific Creatures, but when i was looking through this guide, there were no charts in the walkthroughs; all in paragraph form.The list of weapons and their special attributes was very nice. The pictures are also not nearly as clear as they have been in past guides.In conclusion, this guide will get the job done, but not much more. You can just as easily beat the game without this guide."
2,You can find a better walkthrough online,"This walkthrough was horrible. Yes, it tells you where to go, but I rely on all the fine points. The information is, in total, WRONG. I spent almost half the game building up this one ""skill"", because the ""Witch-king"" is vulnerable to it. Turns out he ISN'T vulnerable to it, the book had wrong information, and while in a fight with the King of the Nazgul, it isn't good to not have any attacks. (*.-) So right now as the Witch-King is waving his mace around on the PS2, I am writing this to let you all know that it's a better idea to just find one online, or just stop cheating. (*.*) By the way, He is NOT Vulnerable to ""Bind Spirit""."
1,"Proofreader, anyone?","Yes, another example of a dreadful Prima Guide. There is this profession called ""editor"", which publishers usually make use of in order to catch mistakes. It would seem that, for the genre of strategy guides, catching mistakes is a secondary concern to making sure to put out the guide in time to coincide with the release of the game. The lists of equipment, which should be cross-referenced, aren't. So, one never knows what equipment is actually found in the game, let alone where it would hypothetically be found. Just plain sloppy."
2,I'd rather listen to Spongebob read this book.,"I had to quit after starting the second cd. Her tone and overly enthusiastic approach for every single concept almost sounds condescending to the listener. She would be better suited to read children's books to a daycare class. The author does have some good pointers IF you can stand to listen so I gave it two stars. I was however very disappointed on the advice for starting smalltalk. ""Just say anything"" is not advice! I was hoping for some more in depth examples and scenarios here. I suppose ""Turkey sandwich"" would be a great icebreaker then."
1,Awful - Don't Waste Your Money,"This audio book goes in the ""Top 10 Things I Should Never Have Wasted My Money On"" list. The author's voice is terribly irritating and is worstened by the overdramatic way in which she reads. I suffered through CD #1 and got half way through #2 before I just couldn't take it anymore. The reason I listened so long is because I kept waiting to get some little tidbit of information that might help me justify the $25 I spent on this audio book. No such luck. The content of this book is nothing more than trite methods we have all heard over and over again. The author gives these methods long, silly names and attempts to pass them off as new ideas. I am sad to say that I cannot find one redeeming quality of this book. Spend your money on something else."
3,It has some good tips.,"I play this audio book(CD) when driving to work or the store; it is an ideal source to find some ideas for when I desire to escalate above the small talk. There are good for learning some tips for 'breaking the ice' or how to get yourself out of a jam if you misspoke especially within a group of people. However, this does not teach about effective communication."
4,Excellent Reading,"The Hawkman and Jennifer come together once again in a novel you won't be able to put down until you've finished the very last page. Double Trouble has blended suspense and the human element into an intricately woven plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you watch this murder mystery unravel. Secrets, hidden hatreds, and betrayal come together to create a story that keeps you right in the middle of the emotions, and events portrayed. The intricate plot will keep guessing all through the novel, and will keep you turning each page with anticipation. Another excellent Hawkman novel."
5,Audrey Hepburn Biography,"First off, I LOVE AUDREY HEPBURN. If you do to, I can tell you this is such a detailed book I can't believe it. Every detail of her professional life is documented here, along with funny anecdotes and tons of info about her private life. Insightful quotes from almost everyone Audrey ever met are included. Includes detailed accounts of her UNICEF work and a filmography and index. Great photos, too. As a devoted fan, I'm glad to have read this biography"
5,Spectacular debut from this noted duo.,"Perhaps what was missing all these years in ex-Wildhearts member Ginger's life is someone equally if not more talented - stranger - and less depressed than himself. Enter Alex Kane the irascible pundit formerly of LSD and now of Antiproduct. The album has a strong sense of humour, and the country parody of ""Unlucky In Love"" may be one of the finest tunes of the year. Kudos to Mr. Kane - sorry he has to be saddled with the emotional baggage which Ginger brings to every project."
5,"For strangely lovable albums, it doesn't get better than this","Got this on its day of release way back in the day simply because Ginger from the Wildhearts recorded it. Back then, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I actually thought it was album of the year at the time. Of course the CD went missing over the years, so I bought it again, and it is still brilliant. Every song is different, and every song is magnificent in its own little way. Lyrical genius is an understatement, and great tunes to match. An album that will make you smile."
1,Charles Wright kills the dead art dead,Precisely what's wrong with most poetry written in the university. P-p-p-painful.
3,To have or not...,"Girls On Film - The Remixes... If Duran Duran went with full techno and remixes, this is the CD to have. Best track is #1 (the Tin Tin Out Mix) for the background effects. #5 (Night Version) if you don't buy the `Essential Duran Duran' CD or the video album. The holdout CD until a `Planet Earth' CD comes out."
3,It could have been better,"The only version worth having is the Tin Tin... mix. The others, except track 5, sound almost the same. I think that it would be worth more if other types of music were sampled instead of this weird crap they used on the Millimeter mixes and the Salt tank mix. Tall Paul could be a wee bit shorter and actually have more singing on it. Nice try guys, don't be so lazy next time!"
3,A revamped classic.,"There are only two mixes here of true value, the first being the Tin Tin Out remix; a killer version for the dance floor. The other mix, is obviously the original Night Version. All the others are decent, but personally the two I've mentioned are worth the cash for this cd. Definately a keeper for fans."
2,"Nice to have Remixes, but one would have done it.","I'm thrilled that Duran Duran have released a new set of mixes! Track 2, The Salt Tank Mix, is a great track that actually uses original Duran Duran music (imagine that!) It's a cool mix. The rest of the mixes leave a little to be desired. Some drum and bass, but otherwise not that great. (the first picture sleeve featuring a BALD Warren!)"
5,An Essential Work,"Of the six biographic books about Shostakovich I have read (E. Wilson, D. Sollertinsky, E. Roseberry, I. MacDonald, S. Volkov, V. Seroff), this book is by a wide margin the best. It is extremely scholarly and extensive, and includes many important personal accounts not previously available. It is very readable and avoids the temptations to analyse which other more shallow (e.g. ""Was he a Commie or not?"") works fall into. One can gain much understanding of Shostakovich and Russia from this insightful work.The book by Roseberry is good, contains many pictures, but is much less extensive. The personal accounts in the book by Sollertinsky, and from the composer's aunt in the Seroff book, are worthwhile compliments to this book.I do not consider the books by MacDonald, which is an extremely shallow analysis of the composer's life and works, or the book by Volkov, which is likely an essentially fraudulent work, to have any value."
5,Great CD,This is an amazingly talented group playing at their best. Keaggy's guitar playing is always best with Glass Harp. Their Strings Attached CD is also great and should be ordered before it too is out of print.Avoid paying excessive amounts for this cd as it is still generally available with a little work. I look forward to their new release set for August 2003.
4,Great guitar playing,Standout guitar playing and quality talent on drums and bass as well. You want a centric guitar CD to listen too and possible learn from this CD will not disappoint.
4,comprehensive guide,"Scotch Whisky by Charles MacLean is a comprehensive guide about the different single malt and blended Scotch whiskies available. It starts with a short history about Scotch whisky and goes on to the making, the regional differences and how to appreciate this very traditional Scottish drink. This is followed by a listing of all the different single malt whiskies and blended whiskies. Each of them is listed by category, distiller and owner. There is also a description of the history of the whisky as well as tasting notes. This guide to whisky is excellent reading for those interested in whisky from the connoisseur to the enthusiastic amateur. And, of course, this book is always a superb gift which is usually very much appreciated."
5,Exciting performance,"This was one of my favorite record albums when I was young. It was a pleasure to introduce to my grandchildren. MOST important is the narrative that starts each track. Many of the other versions do NOT include this. They were my most favorite memories, and the children still resond to them today."
3,Okay-But the frame rate kills it,"NHL 99 brings a fun, although frustrating experience to hockey gaming...I have only briefly played 2000 and I find that to be a better game simply on framerate alone...when a gamer has such choppy framerate as this game develops it becomes extremely difficult to play...this has some pretty neat features such as refs calling back goals...and people being kicked out of games for instigating fights...overall fun but a disapointment!"
3,NHL 99,"It was okay. it was kind of hard to make a season without renaming the teams. It had bad graphics, even for its time. It has hard controls,and it does NOT have numbered player ratings. But it does have the older game ""charm"". One last thing is the free agents require you to go to different teams and release players. Overall, if you like old games I would recommend it if you like old games but if you don't I would not recommend it."
4,VERY FUN!,"This is a pretty good hockey game. You will need to set it on something besides rookie. On this mode it is very easy to score. The first time I played this game, I set it on Rookie. I took the Carolina Hurricanes and played the Detroit Red Wings. The final score was 12-1, hurricanes on top."
4,Good Movie with a Great Twist,The movie had an interesting style and feel. It was not a cookie cutter action film. Most the characters were well developed which allowed you to understand the movie after the surprise ending. Would definitely recommend this to an adult audience.
3,Adam,"Enjoyed the movie. It was very sweet, I like the way the events developed and I think the ending was good and made sense. I felt like Adam learned to live with who he was."
2,scratched,The DVD was received in adequate time but when i opened it there were a lot of scratches and skipped a few scenes when i watched it. I cleaned the DVD and iit still skips.
5,Great movie!,"I wanted to watch this movie to get a perspective, in film form, of Asperger's. I relate to Adam. Great movie worth watching!"
5,great movie - get your kleenex out,"I just finished this movie and for the first time ever am leaving a review. My brother has asperger's, is 29, and even looks a little like the guy playing adam. This is the first depiction of someone with this issue that I have ever seen be so perfect. This is exactly what my brother acts like, even the angry scenes. It broke my heart and I cried for much of the movie, because I don't think my brother will ever get a chance to have someone try to understand him like the girl in this movie. It is even hard for family members to understand. It was touching and relevant and maybe it will open people's eyes at how aspies and nt's do have the same human thread - one of wanting to be accepted and understood AND wanting to accept and understand. Bravo!"
3,not exactly realistic,"This DVD was recommended to me by a therapist as helpful in understanding my husbands Aspergers syndrome. Since we just recently discovered that he had Aspergers I was hopeful that this movie would help both of us understand more. Though a touching movie, this Adam is so low functioning that someone like my husband who is extremely high functioning would be appalled to be compared to him. I will not suggest it to him. I also find it unlikely that such a lovely girl would go beyond a friendly relationship with Adam to a sexual one. Again, he had so many obvious difficulties. Had he been more like the high functioning individuals who do end up in relationships and marriages but just can't quite make them successful because of all the Asperger traits I would have enjoyed it so much more. It's a shame because many 'Aspies' and their partners unwittingly struggle without a clue to what is really wrong and a good movie could bring more understanding to the subject."
3,Superb Performance!,"The acting in this movie is wonderful. Hugh Dancy's portrayal of Adam is spot-on with what it is like to live with Asperger's Syndrome. It was so spectacular that it made my girlfriend cry with tears of empathy. The story ends in a way that you wish it wouldn't, but in the end, it was probably the best way for it to be. Highly applaudable."
1,Snore fest!,I saw this in a movie theater and I thought it would be good. Turned out to be slow and boring. Why can't there be a movie on autism without being a stupid romantic comedy?
2,I couldn't get it to work with Windows 98,"OK, maybe it was me, maybe it just doesn't work well with windows 98 but, I couldn't get any help from the company that I bought it from or the company that made it. The web site that they sent me to didn't exist. It never did work for me."
1,Didn't work for me,"I was really hoping for something after reading a lot of positive reviews. I religiously applied this to the parentheses lines around my mouth, eye-area, and forehead twice a day. After 4 weeks I have not seen any visible changes. Hey, at least it's organic!"
4,"Great product, but plastic caps misaligned","I had recently bought Aubrey's Rosa Mosqueta Rose Hip Seed Oil. I want to start by saying the delivery time was incredible! And the product itself is amazing. However, when I opened the box, I noticed that all of the bottles (There were 12 in the order) had the caps misaligned and some of the oil had leaked out of five of the bottles in the order. The bottles were packed nice and tight, so that there was no way they could have jostled around. This is very disturbing since I had spent over 162 dollars on the order! I usually buy this product in large quantities in order to last a long time, but seeing that all of the bottles had the caps misaligned almost makes me want to reconsider where I buy in the future."
2,dissapointed,"sorry! this product did not deliver as i expected. The reviews were good, that's why i bought it. what a dissapointment.I have used the whole bottle, no improvement at all."
2,Try at your own risk,"Don't get me wrong, this oil was a great moisturizing tool and what have you, but it only worked on my new scars. I have old scars on my cheek from a bad acne outbreak about a year ago. It didn't do anything. I also had some new scars on my upper lip, and they were gone in about two weeks. If your scar is brand new, then this stuff is great. If you're looking for something to get rid of older scars from acne, surgery, or having a rock thrown at your face; go for something more intense like SCARpin.Also, the bottle isn't that generous in size and quite expensive."
2,No change in burn mark when used alone,I didn't see much of an improvement when using this by itself. I have been using it at least 4 times a day since June (maybe I used it too much?)It was only when I started using it with vaseline and castor oil did I notice that my burn mark fading. I was told to buy the Now Foods brand of rosehip seed oil. I guess i will try that one when this bottle is finished.
1,Be warned-you need the casette to use the book,"I bought the book, and when it arrived, I discovered that you cannot use the book without the tape. You cannnot just buy the tape, either. When I tried, I ended up with 2 sets of the book, and 1 tape set. Waste of money. Just buy the book/tape combo."
1,Rusts within 4 months,"Purchased three of these because I thought they looked good. However, after only four months they began rusting all over. Terrible quality!"
2,they rust,"I bought this dispenser and it's larger brother. One for hand soap and one for dish detergent. They both rusted through the bottom. Soap began oozing out the rust spots. I tried coating them with automobile lacquer and they still oozed. The spouts began to ooze soap around the pump neck and one pump eventually stopped working. I paid much more than $9.99 and I am more disappointed because of that. I'm going with plastic, now."
2,"Looks nice, but isn't","Although the product looks nice, it leaks at the dispenser button and also isn't as stainless as you might want it. I.e. mine has a rusty edge already. Fortunately we own an outdoor kitchen also, so we use it there."
3,Stops pumping over time,"This worked great for the first two years, but then it petered out. It just stopped pumping. We cleaned it thoroughly - there didn't appear to be any clogs. Also, although it's stainless, small rust spots will appear. You can remove them with a brillo pad."
4,Dickerson gives religious zealots what they deserve.,"I used to work with the guy who wrote this book. He's one of the cleverest people I've ever met. Really, any brainier and you couldn't stand him. More to the point, he was raised by fundamentalist Christians but managed to achieve escape velocity somehow. What such an upbringing provides in a book like this is insider knowledge and buried rage--a nice alchemical mix for making gold out of stupidity. You will laugh until you cry. I'd give it 5 stars, except that the publisher (as noted by the author) did dilute some of the content, fearing lawsuits and perhaps the wrath of an angry God. But Dave feared no one in writing it, and the combination of wit, weird facts, and imaginative fancy is well worth the low, low price."
4,Funny Hercules comedy spoof,Machiste in the Valley of Woe is funny and Kirk Morris is a very good comic actor which I was suprised to see.He looks amazing and kids his own image in a very funny way. Ignore the poor color and enjoy the comedy.
1,"YEAH, I WASNT LOVIN IT.","bad acting, b-movie. even the actors were nothing to write home about. it wasnt even bad enough to keep me interested. (like a train wreck) or something."
3,It's okay.,This game is good.This game is good as the first ty.The music is really fantastic.This game have upgraded boomerangs and they're very cool.This game also have cool robots like a lifter bunyip.
5,brass yeeeaaa,"It's great well put together love the highs and love the lows, sounds clear would like more albums, pleeease make them cheaper."
5,"Great shoe, great service",You can't go wrong with Allen Edmonds - I have pairs that are 10 years old that after resoling and polishing look brand new.
5,Nice looking shoes,I bought these with the intention of wearing them with tailored pants and nice looking jeans. They look great! They can be worn with jeans if they have no holes or fraying.Wear a 13 in Nike's and these Allen Edmonds fit just right in a 13. A little tight in the toe box but with a little wear and break in will fit great.
5,Wow - super comfortable,"I've always loved Allen Edmonds, but these are terrific - well constructed in a classic design. Have become my go-to shoe for work.Beware of slippery soles on carpet, but that's true of any leather-soled shoe!"
3,Ok on sailboat,Distorts at mid volume. I direct wired an I pod into this unit. iPod works well as head unit. So far so good
1,PYLE marine and car amplifer,"The product does not seem to work and there are very little instructions on how to set it up. I would not buy from this company again unless they can fix it for me, it has already been a huge hassle and big inconvenience."
5,Easy to understnad translation for Travelers to Israel,I was thorougly impressed with this little book. I think it may be out of print and it should not be. Great easy to understand! Definite to take traveling to Israel. Will come in helpful if you do not undertand the language.
5,Unforgettable!,"""Aisha"" is an intriguing and mesmerizing story of an unforgettable character who comes alive in the author's words. Aisha is fiery, passionate and determined, yet feminine and desirable. She is a believable heroine, one that will be admired by modern women. The factors that affected and directed her life show us that adversity cannot quench a lively spirit. ""Aisha"" is a writing accomplishment of great depth and dimension. And this book is particularly valuable now, since it deals with fact-based historical events in the Middle East, the foundation of what is happening today that we are seeing in the news."
5,"Beautiful voice, beautiful music.","I hardly know how to express how I felt the first time I heard this CD and the beautiful voice of John McDermott. He sings sraight from the heart. When you listen to him it is almost as if the things that happened to our servicemen in those wars actually happened to him, that is how much feeling he puts into them. Thank you John for sharing the songs and your beautiful voice with the world."
4,Very good selections and performance,"We purchased this CD after enjoying ""The Irish Tenors"" and wanting to hear more from John McDermott. The album's great. I have one complaint, however. ""In Flander's Field"" is preceded by Jay Unger's ""Ashoken Farewell"". The liner notes say that this instrumental piece is a Civil War song. Actually, it's a contemporary piece that Ken Burns chose to use in his Civil War documentary. He had previously used it in his Huey Long documentary. I was somewhat disappointed that more research wasn't done up front."
2,Disappointing by comparison,"I asked for this CD as a Christmas present because I liked John McDermontt so much on his ""Battlefields of Green"" and as one of the Irish tenors. It was a big disappointment.The first song is the ""U. S. Armed Forces Medley."" Well played march music but with no vocal and not appropriate for a McDermott CD. One wonders ""Why is this here?"" The tune of ""Lili Marlene"" was so improvisational that it was barely recognizable. Perhaps I'm especially critical of this one because ""Lili"" is one of my favorites. If you want to know what it should sound like, and hear a basis for comparison, find the Marlene Dietrich version. As with many of the songs on this CD, the vocal was overpowered by the accompanyment, which was consitantly overloud and disappointing in almost every song.This CD was a poor vehicle for John McDermott's voice and talent. Skip it and buy ""Battlefields of Green"" or one of the ""Tenors"" CDs."
3,No more McDermott!,I know this guy is popular but please. His voice is nasal. He has no style. He sounds as though he is singing the same song over and over again. There is no intonation in his voice. A great deal of whining if you like that sort of thing.
2,"Deep, dead, no crisp! Yuck!","I bought this head after reading that it is especially for hard rock players. That may be, but for my taste it sounds like crap. The sound I ended up with sounds more like I taped my snare wires to a tom-tom. I am using a Pearl steel snare drum. Do not buy this head if you want any degree of crispiness!!"
1,JUNK,Do not buy! I bought these twice and had them replaced twice. Never again. The Evans Dot drum head is much better.
2,Not the entertaining movie I was hoping for,My daughter left the room after about 20 min. into this dvd. Parts of the movie are cute and funny--like when Felix is on the screen. Many parts of movie are slow and not very entertaining. I'm disappointed with my purchase.
4,excellent purchase and product,Bought this item for our 3 1/2 yr old daughter. She loves it!! Watched the movie many times over during the holiday season.
2,Weak,"What passes for a storyline here is convoluted and meandering, and worst of all, too dad-blamed long. At about an hour and 15 minutes, you'll be wondering why they didn't cut out all of the horrendous musical numbers and just make it a half-hour show.Dave Coullier (Felix) is typically annoying, even when he isn't acting annoyingly. His attempts at Felix's voice are grating.The one positive that I can say is that the animation style is appealing. I don't know much else out there like it. The lines drawn around the characters, which are much thicker than what you would see ordinarily, make the presentation visually-appealing.Other than that, there are better titles available, even at this price."
3,whre's Straight No Chaser and Underground,"Agreed with everyone on the lousy packaging. I took mine out the other night and all 3 CD's fell right out. But even worse ""Straight No Chaser"" and ""Underground"" aren't really represented here. What was Columbia thinking?"
1,Pointless,"Normally I do not write reviews. But with this product I decided I needed too. I purchased this item for my Subaru Legacy Sedan. It said on Amazon that it fit. Actually it did. The problem is it doesn't work. You cant mount them low enough to be effective to have your window down in the rain. So I guess it makes my car look better but a pointless add on. So of course when I went to remove them, 1 of them cracked and broke. STAY AWAY!"
1,Soft and commercial,"Seems like they sold too many of the first volume, and have produced a second just to try to rake in a little more. Hardly any of the tracks on this album are funk, and as for Queen being the opener... it speaks for itself. To me, funk is typified by an active bass line, compelling beat and sharp guitar or brass; any or all of these are lacking on most of the tracks here. What you get instead is a collection of slothful, disparate songs, hardly conducive to dancing. Save your money."
2,pure non funk 2,"funk is that kinda vibe you eat hotwings and groove at fish fries funk is when you come out of church's chicken jamming, sorry but half this cd is not funk, d train is bubblegum pop, gap band outstanding is not funky enough, but hits, why is queen on here they was not a funk group, the whispers no way hose, carl carlton's she's a bad mama jama is not a funk classic, i always said these funk compilations does the artists injustice, if you wanna learn what funk is check out the original recordings well i'll list a few, the entire catalog, and entourage of james brown, parliament-funkadelic, sly stone, larry graham, bootsy collins, barkays, ohio players, chaka khan and rufus, cameo,curtis mayfield, mandrill, earth, wind fire, war, the list is endless."
3,"Volume 1 is better, although ""It's Your Thing"" really kicks","Isley Brothers, Kool & the Gang and a few others make up what's really ""pure funk"", and most of the rest is just filler, although it's good filler, too. Volume 1 is recommended more."
5,"Yes, I'm offering you an apple...","but not in a bad way.Gorgeous illustrations, still crisp and vivid, with all kinds of pretty recipes. I like the way he mentions different apples for different purposes. Get me a macoun, someone.Cracked wheat salad with Jonathan apples and mint, Brook trout baked in parchment with Northern Spy apples and others sound good to me."
4,"The Wild Trees, not.","I purchased this video after reading a fascinating book by Richard Preston, ""The Wild Trees"". The protagonist of the book, Steve Sillet, is featured in brief shots during the video, but there is really nothing about the other characters in the book. It does present the historic plight of the redwoods as well as an account of a marathon hike to collect data through the known, but often uncharted redwood territory, south to north. I had hoped for more video views of the redwood canopy. Overall, it is an interesting look at a biome that has nearly vanished."
3,...but I prefered the book version,Read the book which stimulated me to get the video. Video quality is excellent and I would still recommend it especially if you didn't want to read the book.
2,cute but poorly constructed,"This tack trunk is a lot of fun but not well made. Between our two horsey girls, we received three of these for Christmas this year. Two of the three literally fell apart as we took them out of the box Christmas morning. After gluing them back together and letting them dry for 24 hours, they're great. So, if you consider the purchase a kit (to make a tack trunk), at what might be considered a premium price, in the end - it's a good one."
4,Decent stuff,"Sufficiently complex sound. Melodic, but not really any strong hooks, and nothing that really got my head nodding with the beat. Some tribal influences. Nothing annoyingly repetitous (a big plus for me). Lots of variety (maybe too much - Track 7 is more of an R&B song and seemed out of place). When present, pro-Christian lyrics (that I sometimes wished were more integrated with the music - the sparse vocals on Tracks 1 and 2 seemed to be just ""sitting on top of the music""). Overall, it's pretty decent stuff, but I would highly recommend starting with all of Andy Hunter's stuff and then go here if you want more of similar."
1,This makes a great Pizza cutter for what its worth!,"I am not a fan of Twisted Metal nor Vigilante 8, and this game which I took a chance and bought it at a pawn shop for .99 cents, and believe me its not even worth .99 cents. This game utterly sucks!The graphics suck, and the gameplay is so annoying. Nascar is not one of my favourites either, I would rather stick to street racing such as Need for Speed or even Grand Tourismo. Sorry, but this is one of the worst games out on the playstation.This game makes a good mobile or a Pizza cutter, thats about it!Thanks for reading."
4,Bad Boys,It was a great movie I never thought or knew that capone asked dillinger for help on robbing a bank he asked the right guy robbing banks was dillingers number 1 hobby
1,New Age Revision,"Readers of this book consistently report to me that they find this book unintelligible. This is no surprize. The author gives us an endless array of jargon cobbled together in a way that obviously makes sense to her. To others better acquainted with her meanderings it is not only poorly written, but what is presented as fact is fiction, and what is fiction is frightful. One reader repeatedly copied and recopied a phraze from the book, over and over, as if by doing so she could make sense of it. Sadly enough, there was no sense to be found. But people are unreasonably trusting and that trust is egregiously exploited by anyone who promotes this book as something of quality and worth reading. It is unintelligible. When no longer looking for the sense in nonsense, it becomes humorous and pathetic."
5,It's about you...,"It is a book about morals. It has sayings in it which will make you think twice. It is a handybook. It will assist you towards finding your 'self'. Although better and more knowledgable books are out there, yet the sayings in this book make you aware. The thoughts in this book are inspired. A must have..."
3,Okay,"This book is small and really just a good overview of what Bonsai's are like. This is sort of a starter guide, explaining the ins and outs of Bonsai. If you're just beginning raising the trees, this is a good book to add to your collection. If you, however, already have a knowledge base about raising and caring for Bonsai, you can move along to a more comprehensive book."
4,Somewhat dry,"I expected more info on techniques, however for the begginer it is OK start. Some good pictures to show how to trim, prune etc your beloved bonsai baby."
5,Very Helpful Book; Great Illustrations,"""101 Essential Tips"" is a very helpful introductory book about growing bonsai. It covers a lot of different topics. The photographs are absolutely beautiful and illustrate techniques well. The book does not go into a lot of depth and I will likely be looking for somehing more in depth, but this is a great book for the novice."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I got this book with such high expectations after reading all the other reviews, but when I got the book, I was sorely surprised. It has tips but that all they are, its unspecific and it only gives you basic shapes and tells you its important to create a balance and other methods without ever teaching you how or why. And it makes it seem like all bonsais are the same, when the species is very important and does matter in the selection of stuff, like shapes for instance. This book is alright, but it should only be bought as a companion, not as a guide."
4,A great reference and beginner book,"This is an excellent book, with step-by-step instructions and descriptive pictures. It covers many topics from bonsai history, to starting your own bonsai from scratch, to maintaining it.TIP: If you buy this book, don't buyThe Complete Book of Bonsai. I bought both, and was disappointed to see they are the same book, only this one is an abridged version ofThe Complete Book of Bonsai. They are published in the US by Abbeville Press and in London by DK."
2,Pretty Pictures. No tangible information,"There are a lot of gorgeous pictures in this book unfortunately if you want to know how to start a Bonsai this is not the book for you. It had a few interesting facts about different varieties of Bonsai but no real ""how to"" instructions. Completely useless for a beginner."
2,"Information too broad, too thin","For my purposes, interest in keeping my newly purchased bonsai plant alive, this book falls fairly short. The amount of the book that pertains to that is a few paragraphs. The rest of the book covers what seems like every aspect of bonsai growing, spending a small paragraph on each topic. So if you want to know how to grow a bonsai, transplant, or really do any one thing, you might want to think about a more in depth book, because this one comes off as something that should be in an elementary school library."
3,3-4 star,I love the pictures and the descriptions but when my brother bought me a bonsai...this book didn't describe what exactly i had and how to take care of mine...maybe i needed another to understand better...
3,book,have bought 3 plant books about bonasi careand wish they had 1 like bonasi for dummiesthat would tell you about the plants that you havebecause I have not found 1 yet
4,Small book but very informative,There are lots of photos besides information on how to achieve your goal. This is what I liked about the book! I need to see photos to help in doing the job. Good section on tools & repotting. Over all I found this book to be very helpful.
4,Bonsai (101 Essential Tips),This book is straight forward and extremely easy to understand. Detailed images illustrate the various techniques and stimulate further curiosity. A definite must have for the rookie Bonsai enthusiast!
4,Cute book,"This book is exactly as advertised, a book of useful tips. It is NOT a complete ""how to bonsai"" encyclopedia, it does however have a decent amount of useful information. I bought this as a gift to go along with a bonsai tree I purchased for my daughter."
3,average book,This book is ok for the money. It is short and does not give a long explanation or process. It is a basic basic basic bonsai book. I would only buy this if you are considering bonsia
4,Easy read,"It is a lot smaller then what I thought it would be. It touches on 101 subjects as promised but when I say 'touched' I mean mentioned it and gives you 2 sentences on each subject. Would be great for anyone just wanting to learn terms and some basic principles for bonsai. But if you are looking for details, I would pass and get a more expensive book. All in all worth the $5 if you are just wanting to get an idea of what Bonsai is."
3,Much To Small,"This book does have some wonderful information about Bonsai. However, the author of this book clearly chose quality over quantity. It is so thin, that it can easily fit into a small pocket or get lost. The section in this book that tells about different types of trees that are commonly bonsai, is very thin. It does not even mention Juniper, which is a very common type of Bonsai.I do recommend this book, but buy it used if you can. Better yet, buy a larger book with more information. There is not enough information in it to be worth five dollars."
2,Not Very Helpful,"This is a decent book for someone who has no idea at all about Bonsai and has a curiosity, but no interest in trying it out. The explanations are brief and not very informative. If you know enough about Bonsai that you're actually looking for a book on the subject, there's probably nothing in here that you don't already know. If you're looking for a good book for beginners that actually has good advice and more than just common knowledge, I would recommendThe Bonsai Workshop (Our Garden Variety). It's a little bit more expensive, but well worth it. Good luck!"
3,Know what you are getting,"I think this is a good summary of a great deal of info on bonsai, but not enough for someone really learning, more of a pocket guide (perhaps a good gift for someone who MIGHT like bonsai). It is a condensed version (very condensed) of Tomlinson's excellent book ""Complete book of Bonsai&quot. I suggest you buy a more complete book first, then get this if you need one for a backpack (say on expedition to collect trees for your bonsai). This small version will help you remember what you have already read in detail. Also, before you buy anything, don't miss Amy Liang's ""The Living Art of Bonsai: Principles & Techniques of Cultivation & Propagation"" which has the most beautiful full color full page photos, and perhaps the most in depth knowledge I have seen yet on Bonsai. Truly a gorgeous book, worth having for the artistic side alone, for a coffee table. Happy pruning X% :)"
2,Too small,The book is too small. It is NOT written for the beginner as described. Yes it does show the different styles but not enough on how to create them or really even that much on how to take care of a Bonsai.
4,Very good ready reference,Very good handy reference for someone more or less familiar with bomsai techniques. Highly recommended.
4,Bang for the buck,"This is a good little book for the price. Covers a lot of ground but doesn't go very deep into any one area. Did not need the pages on displaying, could have used more on care and shaping, but this does have more than some other bigger books."
4,All the simple bonsai questions answered.,My wife needed a handy reference book that addressed all the most asked questions about growing bonsai. This book is a gem and fits the bill! My wife uses this book often!
5,Nice book,I bought a bonsai for my oldest son (age 15 at the time). There is some great information on taking care of your bonsai in this book and much more.
2,Very little book,I expected a full size book but it is more like a large pocket size. It doesn't have as much information as I thought it would either. It is not a bad book but dont expect too much.
2,Not nearly enough information for a beginner,"This is basically just a picture book with captions. It will familiarize you with different styles and concepts, but does not provide any useful ""tips"" as the title suggests, nor does it provide any information which I would consider essential to learning bonsai, so much as just understanding what it is and what it looks like. I bought this book as a beginner and having read it, am no more informed than I was before.The information available for free on the internet is far more in-depth and useful than this book. I'm leaving it at two stars because the pictures really are great and show a wide range of design options. I will keep the book to use those as a reference, even though the book does little if anything to explain how to accomplish those designs."
2,Bobsia review,The book had a lot of differant type bonsia but did not have enough information on how to care for the trees properly.DPC Toledo Oh
2,This book was BADsai!,"Upon recieving this book as a gift from my late husband, I discovered that the information given in this book was quite unsatisfactory. As a seasoned Bonsai enthusiast, I found it degrading and demeening and an insult to my intelligence. Any serious Bonsai lover would know enough to realize the suggestions given in this manual are foolish and obscene.I hope this helps."
3,OK,Got it as part of a 3 part deal. It doesn't have a lot of info. Don't think I'd of just bought it on it's own
3,Nice pictures was hoping for more detail on how to do more with bonsai,"I was hoping this book would give a very detailed way of starting new bonsai trees, re-potting old ones and how to remove the right amount of roots to maintain growth in the same pot. The book has a lot of nice bonsai pictures but I feel the instructions for actually performing bonsai training were not as good as they could have been."
5,"I am resident of Moscow, Russia.","I am resident of Moscow, Russia. (I am not a 12 year old reader but I could not get the normal review page to work.) Being specialist in Corporate Finance I had to change the job twice in last 3 years. Purely by chance I bought Gary Grappo's book in one store in Moscow and since then it became my tool to get the job I want in hard today markets in Russian. It helped me twice, the first time I found the job in 1 month after contacting 60 potential employers, second time it was respectively 5 and 100. I must say that the book written by Mr. Grappo helped me to survive in really hard environment and taught me a lot of the ways to become successful in life. I want to thank him full heartedly and to wish him success with his new book Career ReExplosion."
1,Wolf in sheep's clothing,"Although the editors of this book claim to present a range of different beliefs, readers should be aware that they themselves advocate a Jurassic view of sexuality and male-female relationships. Celia Wolf-Devine serves as an ""expert witness"" for groups that oppose marriage equality, testifying that complementary genitalia should be the sole criteria for legally recognized unions. It is a relief to know she is retired from teaching. This textbook belongs more comfortably within a fundamentalist Christian curriculum than in a liberal arts setting."
1,bored,"If this is his best effort how will it be the worse. I can't find the faboulous voice anywhere. It's always the same bored voice in every bored track of the disc. It's really difficult to note differences betweens tracks. They look always the same one. Maybe a couple of them are more idiosincratics.I think Rufus is the best exemple of the status of the contemporary pop music. Maybe into the actual pop scene Rufus is one of the best, but if you look back and compare this disc with thousands of masterworks in the 60s, 70s, 80s or even 90s the only posible conclusion is that you have wasted your money and your time."
5,probably my favorite album i own.,"i've been a fan and avid listener of rufus wainwright for a couple of years now, before the release of ""poses"". even so, whenever i go back and listen to his work -- especially on this album -- i am constantly amazed at how much more i find underneath his lyrics. this is a beautiful album rife with poetry and brilliance - an example of what music should be, and why it deserves to be called ""art"". the more i find out about rufus, the more i appreciate his music. everyone's favorite line seems to be ""i did go from wanting to be someone else/ now i'm drunk and wearing flip flops on fifth avenue"" from the title track. i can't recommend this album enough. buy it and listen for yourself."
5,Rufus Best pop cd,"Wow! What a rich experience. Rufus Wainwright's voice is amazing. He has a classical voice but in this popular medium he makes his vocals very accessible. He clearly benefitted from being raised by his musical McGarrigle motherThe McGarrigle Hourand also from his talented singer songwriter Wainwright fatherStrange Weirdos: Music from and Inspired by the Film Knocked Up.This is the best cd to start with if you are introducing yourself to Rufus Wainwright's music. Each song has a distinctly different feel to it and uses different musical talents. Although I think of ""Poses"" as his best cd, the song ""Going to a Town"" on his new cd ""Release the Stars"" is one of the best songs of 2007, reflecting on the impressions one gets lately from spending time in America and anywhere else in the world."
5,A Great Singer,"I heard Rufus Wainwright sing at the Bottom Line in NYC back in early 2001, along with his mother and aunt, the McGarrigles. He sang a few numbers, including the one he did in Moulin Rouge, which sadly was barely heard. Too bad. It was astounding. His voice is beautiful. But he spent the night gettng toasted with a glass of red wine while he sang. I've read a couple of other interviews that make me hope Mr. Wainwright takes care of himself so he's around a long time."
5,"Perfect pop, Rufus does it again and better","Rufus,you are the man. What can I say? Your cd is a gem, perfect, intelligent yet accessible, biting, funny, sad, beautiful, just PLAIN PERFECT. Thank you for making the kind of music few others do."
3,Rock 'n' roll or hoochie-koo?,"I heard Rufus perform many of these songs live in L.A. where he seemed to have evolved his gen-x Cole Porter/Stephen Foster persona into some sort of intriguing amalgamation of Franklin Pangborn and Robert Plant. I held hope then that this disc of ornamental ditties might rock a little more than it does. There are solid melodies and ideas here, but they seem to be trapped in the layers of (overly?) romantic gauze still hanging around from the first album. You know that when a collaboration with the Propellerheads (""Shadows"") sounds stillborn and an homage to Led Zeppelin (""Evil Angel"") is more chamber music than evil backwater blooz, something's askew. Perhaps Poses will grow on me, its subtle charms digging deeper than they did on the first few listens. Wish the lyric pages in the booklet were easier to read however; Rufus' enunciation is still a thing uniquely his own!"
2,"Occasionally inspired, but more often pretentious","Rufus Wainwright unquestionably has talent as a songwriter. ""Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk"" and ""Poses"" in particular display a remarkable ability to craft emotionally evocative lyrics, set to melodies that are restrained and quite shimmeringly beautiful. ""Greek Song"" possesses a similar cast. But other than that - and with the possible exception of ""California"" - one soon tires of Wainright's flat, nasal vocals and the overall monotony of most of his melodies. Perhaps his lyrics work better as poetry, to be read and not sung?""Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk"", however, is guaranteed to get stuck in your brain. You will find yourself singing along to it for days."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD after reading many reviews from various sources. Most of them were favorable, so I decided I'd done enough research and bought it. The guy's a real downer. All his songs sound the same. Does he even have a 1 octave range? Yeah, his lyrics are kitschy and cute, like ""oh, I've felt like that before, but just couldn't put it into words."" Thank you, Rufus. And what's so big deal about having ""famous"" parents. What else do you remember about Loudon Wainwright, III than ""Dead Skunk in the Middle of the Road?"" I haven't given up on ""Poses"" yet, but it isn't on my ""Play"" list."
5,Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk.,"If you have my previous reviews i saw Rufus w/ ben and guster this summer, Rufus i have a huge respect and apperciation for. at first listen Rufus somewhat annoyed me with his voice but after listen to all 3 of cds in one day i was head over heels in love with it, to really enjoy Rufus you have to listen to how his cd flows and you will understand how happy it makes you and how your mind just wonders while listening to him, its like dreaming without being alseep."
4,Classic yet contemporary 'Poses',"Rufus Wainwright continues to reincarnate Tin Pan Alley standards with well-crafted, smart, and at times Beatlesque pop songs that grow richer upon repeated listens. The record is chock-full of instrumentation, as the last album was, and the producers (Pierre Marchand, Damian leGassick, and Alex Gifford) do a fantastic job of layering instrumentation for a full-but-not-cluttered sound.Many of the songs on ""Poses"" still mine the ground of the pessimistic romantic. On ""California,"" our hero is so overwhelmed (or underwhelmed) by the possibilities the Sunshine State holds, ""that I think I'll stay in bed ...that I think I'll sleep instead."" Or, as he resignedly states on the title cut, ""Life is a game, and true love is a trophy."" The best moment on the album, though, is ""One Man Guy,"" Rufus's cover of his father's classic. It's a brilliant song, and Rufus does it every justice.Visit my full review at tapioca.net."
5,Rufus is popular guy,I think Rufus is very hard working guy. He is very popular. His family is too. Like Kate and Anna McGarrigle and his sister Martha. And of course Loudon Wainwright. But Rufus is very famous. Keep with the good work Rufus.
4,Wainwright displays a nimble virtuosity,"Wainwright is akin to someone like Tori Amos. Both are phenomenal artists, both will be virtually ignored by popular radio.*** The album title track has the most quoted (in print reviews) and evocative lyrics in which Wainwright confesses to being ""drunk and wearing flip-flops on 5th Avenue."" However, other songs are equally poignant as in ""Rebel Prince"" when he laments ""where is my master, the rebel prince/ who will shut all of these windows... these windows who are telling me/ to rid my dirty mind of all its preciousness.""*** Wainwright is a modern torch singer, like a solemn and clever School House Rock balladeer. You either dig his voice or you don't. But if you do, you're very, very lucky."
4,Terrific Stuff,"One in a million is ole Rufus and here his sound is a little snappier, a little sharper. The music-hall edges and Cole Porter style swagger are still present but in clearer focus. His debut was terrific, don't get me wrong, but I feel that with extended airplay this grower gives a little more. Highly recommended for all intelligent songwriters out there.."
2,disappointed,"When we first got this CD we were excited after hearing ""Cigarettes and chocolate milk"". The CD soon found it's way to the back of the shelf, where it now collects dust."
5,"Great Stuff, but not by U2","This CD contains music by someone who is not a member of U2, and none of the members of U2 perform on this CD. Members of U2 did not compose any of the songs or music on this CD. If you are looking for a U2 CD, this one falls outside your search. Please move along."
2,Extremely Dissapointing,"I bought this cd after hearing ""hallelujah"" and ""across the universe."" It is nothing like these songs. They do not emphasize his terrific voice and come off as extremely odd. He needs to just stick to what he is good at."
4,This is the first time I've heard Rufus's music,"""Poses"" is the first exposure I have heard from Rufus Wainwright. I only picked up a copy of ""Poses"" is because I have heard such good things about Rufus as an artist and how some people were anticipating to buy this album. The first time I listened to this cd was at work, where I can't really listen to music very loud, so basically I didn't know what to make of Rufus Wainwright. Now that I have listened to ""Poses"" at home, now I know what to make of him.I really enjoyed ""Poses"" both musically and lyrically. There is a biting humor to the songs here on ""Poses"", for example ""Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk"" which delves into the songwriter's personal vices. With a title like ""In A Graveyard"", one would think that it would be a morbid ballad when in actual reality it is more charming than morbid. There are a couple of songs on the album that I thought were only so-so but overall I really did enjoy ""Poses"" immensely."
4,magical mystery tour,"buy this cd, borrow this cd, steal this cd... just get your hands on it, and dive in. i hope you have already taken the journey through his previous releases. this is another trip worth taking. music, voice, lyrics - he offers a complete, completely mesmerizing package. highs and lows this good are not normally achievable sans illegal chemicals.Rufus is a world apart, a world i love to visit, and i am considering a permanent move there. when i get my loft in rufusville, you are all welcome to stay. but don't wait, visit rufusville today. it's wonderland. it's a fantastic cabaret. it's a magical mystery tour."
3,Artistry 5 Stars; Vocals 1 Star,"If you like his vocals, this album is stellar. The craftsmanship, lyrics, and musical composition on this album are superb. Unfortunately, I *still* cannot stomach his whiney, gnatty voice. What a pity for me. This guy is SO talented."
5,Best body lotion on the market - Ecco Bella,"I have tried many products over the years for my feet and heels that crack. Nothing worked until Ecco Bella Lotion, which has 0 water in it. It was recommended by a friend of mine who is a massage therapist. I no longer buy any other lotion. I also love the vanilla scent, it is clean smelling and lasts."
4,Ecco Body Lotion,"The Vanilla Ecco is wonderfully smelling and an effectively emollient body lotion, it is all I use."
4,Wonderful story!,"I loved following the life of one man for his 80 year life to present day, going from Vermont to Austrailia. Lots of information about both locations. A good read for anyone who loves looking at people, birds and reflecting on life."
1,Played way too fast,The live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing. It took me a long time to track down a recording of this work that I'm entirely satisfied with. I feel that Richter plays the Diabelli Variations far too quickly. Just listen to the last variation to see what I mean. The less said about Anderszewski the better.
1,"Big, but not heavy duty","Like another reviewer, my bag broke while it was loaded, and I was trucking along. I packed a textbook, 16oz H20, 16oz coffee, and a Dell Precision M6400 with power brick and mouse. It fits, but the plastic clips that attach the bag to the shoulder strap are crap. One broke under the load and I found out something else. While the back panel is padded to protect your humongous laptop, the edges are not padded. So when the bag decided to free fall, it landed on the corner of my laptop. So far, the only damage to the laptop is a dented corner. The laptop corner actually cut through the bag's canvas, and so there is a cut on the bottom of the bag now. The dent is bad enough that I almost soiled myself when I saw it. To Dell's credit, the laptop seems to be functional.Thanks a lot High Sierra, for cheaping out on the most mechanically critical part of this bag. If they would have used a better resin, or even metal like a carabiner, this would not have happened."
3,Femme fatale,"I cannot understand why the young male characters in the Agatha Raisin series are so fascinated with this stocky, rude, overeating, heavy-drinking, middle-aged, promiscuous, immature, nosy woman. Her relationship with James is nowhere, and putting them together in book after book to solve crimes is getting a bit strained. James is growing more and more unbelievable. If he's not going to be developed, if his relationship with Agatha isn't going to be developed, get James out of there. This initially very appealing series is getting boring."
4,Quite The Title!!,This is a good Agatha Raisin story. I found myself enjoying it immensely. Of course it helped that James Lacey was not in it as much as he is in some of the other stories. I don't like him and I wish Agatha would forget him and get on with her own life. Agatha's a mix of city sophisitication and small town vulnerability and that is what makes her so appealing.In this book Agatha is working freelance on public relations for a new spring water company in a neighbouring village. The commercialization of the spring has opened up a Pandora's box of bad feelings in the village and results in two murders (in true Agatha fashion). In this one though we see a mosltly solo Agatha working on solving the mystery. At the very end she is joined by her village friends to unmask the killer.
2,Tin Head...,"ROBO MAN is about a famous American physicist, named Martino, who returns from Russia after a severe automobile accident. Upon arrival, we see that his head, left arm, and upper body have been replaced w/ metal. He is taken to a secret facility for debriefing / interrogation. Elliot Gould plays a suspicious government agent who doesn't believe Martino's story. This movie is fairly slow. Nothing really happens for the first 50+ minutes. Then, once Martino leaves the government facility, the ""action"" begins (sort of). There's an assassination attempt, a car chase, an explosion, and the big reveal. A strange film. I found myself (almost) engrossed in it, even while nodding off!..."
5,absolutely great!,"This is an awesome sunshade for the car it really protects from heat and reduces the temperatures inside, i also like the fact that is cut to fit."
2,Anecdotal Ghost Research,"The author is a sensitive who writes about her own experiences and those that have been told to her by others. There is nothing compelling about the photographs and very little proof, research or data to back up her claims. This is a very light piece of work at best."
4,seems like it will work great,"great snug fit over the top of the t-posts. couldn't get it on some old beaten up posts but had no problems with newer posts. haven't had it long so not sure on the longevity, but so far so good."
2,"Content Good, Construction Very Poor","The content of the flash cards is very good. However, given the poor quality of the paper used I can't give this product more than 2-stars. The manufacturer didn't use card stock, and in fact the paper feels like it is less than 20 lb. stock. They really cut corners with the paper and I don't expect these cards to last. I don't think using a good quality card stock would raise the price very much, but it would be worth it to have these cards last for even one semester. I purchased these for my daughter who is taking 9th grade geometry."
5,"Caution: does NOT come with a cd, but still well worth it","From the description I thought we might get a cd version of the cards along with the boxed version.It DOES NOT come with the cd.Nevertheless,these are great study aids, especially for geometry, when making your own cards would be very time consuming because of all the diagrams you would have to draw.The cards are 9.2 cm by 5.3 cm in size and made from a lightweight non glossy cardboard."
5,PUNCTUATION MADE EASY,"I WAS HOPING BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS CD THAT IT WOULD BE VERY DETAILED IN LEARNING FOR MY CHILD AND AT THE SAME TIME FUN. I WAS IMPRESSED, IT IS EVERYTHING THAT I READ FROM THE DESCRIPTION. I DO LIKE THE PRODUCT FOR MY CHILD AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT'S HELPING HER IMPROVE. GREAT CD.... THANKS ALOT!"
5,Great way to learn punctuation,"My kids also enjoyed this CD in the series and really improved their skills. The format is fun and the ""host"" makes the teaching of each subject clear and gives plenty of exercises to test themselves. You can keep track of their test scores to see their improvement too."
4,pretty good selection,"The 4 stars are for the song selection, and not for Mario's Voice.Mario Lanza voice will always be a 5 star.There are great signers in this world, and he was one of them.Bravo Mario."
5,happysmom,I ordered Mario Lanza's Greatest Hits for my 94 year old Mom who is legally blind. She has always enjoyed opera and classical music. It was a gift from me for her 94th birthday. Makes her day to hear the voice of a great opera singer from the past.
5,What a voice,"It is unfortunate they didn't include ""Danny Boy"" in this selection. His powerful voice was perfect for Irish songs. It would have been a better introduction to his work to have included that. His voice is powerful and addresses every nuance of emotion and lyric. Probably one of the greatest singers of the 20th century. No question about that. Now, he is singing in the angelic choir. He was a fine Christian man."
1,Lanza greates hits I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM YET AS I HAVE REPORT IT BUT HAVE BEEN CHARGE,I have not received this poroduct I am stillwaiting I have wrote the seller and with no results. Ana Kirk
5,Introducing the Greatest Voice of All Time,"A new generation of music lovers deserves to know, understand and appreciate the greatness of Mario Lanza. Five decades after his passing, millions of lovers of ""grand voices"" still are held in awe by the power, passion and beauty of his voice.This selection of recordings has a number of fine selections that give a small ""flavor"" of his fantastic talent and skills. It is a good beginning for someone who wants to know ""The American Caruso."""
5,Cutting-edge technology textbook will set the trend for 2000,"This book comes with an accompanying CD-ROM that contains the entire book, as well as powerful features that cannot be used within the constaints of paper and ink. Movies, appendices, internet links, and real-time mathematical models can be run in the context of a well-written text. Helpful interactive end-of-chapter Q/A sections and the ability to search though the text or automatically click linked words to see their definition in the gloassary is yet unparalelled in today's classrooms. A must have just for the approach to teaching!"
2,HER OWN SPECIAL MAGIC!,"THIS IS MS.KAUFFMAN SPECIAL MAGIC BECAUSE, WE HAVE A BOOK WITH 3 LOVE STORY THAT WAS TO SHORT,HERE WE HAVE SEBASTIEN VALENTIN COMING OUT OF THIS CURSE SWORD HE WILL MACTH 3 PEOPLE WITH A SOULMATES.FRIST OF ALL THIS BOOK WAS TO SHORT FOR 3 LOVE STORYS,YOU CAN'T GET INTO EACH ONES STORY,AS GOOD AS WE NEED TO.THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECT A LOVE STORY TO BE ,I ENJOYED HER FRIENDS STORY BETTER THAN THE MAIN CHARACTERS.THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I HOPE FOR ONLY 2... STARS"
3,Book Store owner meets Pirate Genie,`You Wish is my Command' by Donna Kauffman is very unique mystical romance novel. The main character Jamie finds magic swords that summons a pirate genie to find soul mates for three people. The story unfolds a sweet and heartbreaking romance of Jamie and her soul mate Sebastian (aka the pirate genie.) This was a fun and offbeat read.
3,Different!,"This is the first time that I have read anything by this author. I enjoyed the plot of the story...it was intruiging. The idea of a genie making merry matches is amusing. However, I was disappointed that the main characters left me wanting more from them. The other characters were elaborated on quite a bit in the beginning of the story, only to be summarly dropped in the middle of the story. You are left wondering if they too had a ""happily ever after ending"" ."
2,Only if you must and have nothing to do.....,"When I bought this book, I thought that it would be intresting to read 3 love stories.But it was too short and the end was not what I've imagined.Anyway, I didn't like the main characters so much. I was more intrested in the others. Her two friends and their soulmates....I've just finished reading ""Royal Hunter"" and I've decided not to read anymore of this author. Don't get me wrong, I liked the stories and I'll give these books a okey. But it's not one of my favorites. So I'd rather read something else......"
5,Couldn't have asked for more!!!,This is a great option compared to the home depot solutions we tried out. This net went over our PVC/home depot goal which was 5 ft wide x 4 ft high x 3 ft deep. It fits real snug and did not fall off when we slapped pucks in. Net is weaved together real nicely. The red is not overpowering compared to a white net and do not notice it during game play. Definately will buy again! Hope to have in other colors!
3,Great price,"This is a great price for the net. It is well made, however it could be a little better fit. It was too tight for the frame I made from PVC Pipe. My measurements were exact. Hopefully as time goes on it will stretch a little."
2,Poor quality,"Looks nice, size is appropriate, comes wIth Velcro straps. BUT very thin and tears easily- not worth the money. Get a more sturdy net."
3,good net if you have JUST the right frame,I built a frame for this net out of PVC and it fits just fine...after making several adjustments to the original dimensions. But its pretty much exactly what it says it is. :)
4,Helene's Portrait,A very good sampling of early Helene.The Gershwin is very moving.i have several other recordings of her and they are all excellent.Continued success for her.Tony G
1,BEWARE! Not genuine Apple - and not even functional!,"I saw the pic, read the description, and figured I would pay the premium and get the genuine Apple replacement. WOW what a surprise I got when the box arrived. I'm not sure what they sent, but it was a more traditional PC type of powerbrick arrangement and absolutely not what was pictured. The kicker was, the power cord that goes from the wall to the brick was not even the proper cable end to plug into the brick! Needless to say I filed the a-z claim to get my $ + shipping back. I would give no stars if that was possible. Keep looking, this isn't what you want!"
1,45W as opposed to a 65W?,"I ordered a ACG4 AC Power Adapter for my old Mac iBook G4. This company sent me a 65W which is not compatible with and did not work for my laptop. A company needs to hold to the integrity of the order placed, and, as appeared to me, not use this venue as a way to get rid of their stuff. It is very disappointing, time consuming, irritating, really kind of stupid and a waste of my energy."
4,Great Book,"What a easy and informative book to read. It helps with all ages. I have a very head strong little boy and this was such a helpful book on how I need to handle him, to help him learn to deal with his stressful situations. This book has more ""real"" information then most that I have real (and I've read a few!)"
5,author's review,"This is a booklet that takes the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator theory of personality differences and applies it to the classic three 12 step disciplines: prayer, meditation, and inventory. The spirituality is inclusive, and contains more hints and affirmation than detailed instruction. It's a quick read and works for most people I have worked with."
4,Two tear drop,"Steve is very good at entertaning people, and he is a very good writer and singer,which is very rare to find.keep the good work up steve,you dont need Garth or nobodyto help you achieve you goal."
5,A Fine Overview of a Neglected Band,"Family never got the respect they deserved. The album FEARLESS is one of the greats of the rock era, though impossible to classify-- loose-limbed rock/jazz/folk/weirdness. Brilliant musicianship and inspired songwriting showed a group completely unified and right at their peak. Much of that album is included here, with lots of other goodies from previous and subsequent works, providing an excellent precis of their entire career. As an introduction, or as a best-of, it's well worth owning."
4,Wicked Funny Music,Excellent choices for drunken idiots to sing to. Get some culture while you get smashed!
3,Good music but not very Oktoberfest-like,"The picture and title of this CD is misleading. Lot's of classical music, but not much to do with drinking beer. Maybe I have to understang Italian and German to get the significance of most of the songs, but this is definitely not a CD I will be playing during Oktoberfest."
2,"In the end, not all that interesting","At some point in time--say, maybe twenty years or so before it was actually published--a book like this might have seemed daring simply because anal sex wasn't discussed that often, especially by women, who (at least in various sex surveys) seemed far less interested in it than men, and generally didn't do it as often as they do now. But now, this book seems to occupy some territory between quaint and queasy. So she had a little pillow that she used during the act? That's cute, I bet that you can get something like that on Etsy. So she saved every used condom from the act in a little container? That's... wait, what? Not everyone's kink is weird in a particularly interesting way."
4,"""One brave woman""","Finally,a courageous soul willing to ""bare"" her very sexy self in a most intimate memoir of the pleasures of the back door. This book is designed to become a classic in women's true liberation. My one criticism is that a few short chapters appear to be included strictly as filler, but who cares when even the filler is tantalizing!"
4,Enjoyable,An interesting memoir by a woman who deepens her spiritual life through anal sex. The joining of spirituality and anal sex actually has an ancient pedigree which Christianity has sought to repress. It has largely been kept alive in left-hand path spiritual traditions.
3,Shocking but stimulating,"Shocking but stimulating, not written well, thought her wording was a bit choppy. The story was interesting though and I did enjoy the book."
3,What the??????????????,"I read The Surrender : An Erotic Memoir and have absolutely no idea what to make of it.On one side, it is a great read. On the other side, the author is off. I have never met the author, but it seems clear that she has issues."
4,Tale of a Female Predator,"What I found shocking about Toni Bentley's Surrender wasn't her love affair with anal sex - or actually, maybe it was. This authoress is a chilling female predator. Never once in the catalogue of lovers throughout Ms. Bentley's life could I detect warmth or compassion in her attitude towards men. Not that that's a bad thing. Perhaps years of ruthless work and competition in the ballet world contributed to this seductress's lack of interest in men beyond sex. Her mesmerizing description of sodomy has a lost-down-the-rabbit-hole quality, almost as if she's been caught in her own game. When a powerfully cold women is helpless to resist what one lover can do to her, it makes for a very sexy read."
3,"""Innocent"" fun read","Well.... I'm not sure what to say. I found this book interesting and ""instructive"" in some ways. It was a unique experience to have something so ""tabo"" and undiscussed written about so blatantly."
2,"Overly ""anal-lytical""","""The Surrender"" certainly has a titillating topic: a woman who's obsessed with being sodomized by her lover, the cartoonishly named Mr. A. The memoir, however, is a curious blend of the pornographic and the banal. Her descriptions of being anally penetrated are often erotic but she over-analyzes her motivations and induldges in psuedo-philosophizing.When the focus is on her ass, Bentley's prose is lucid. But when she goes metaphysical, the prose turns purple and pretentious."
4,A very interesting read.,"This book is very interesting although not written excellently, it gives an insight to both men and women as to why a woman would even consider this type of sex. Definitely something you should prepare yourself for by being open minded to the author's experiences."
3,Hot reading,"Even if anal sex isn't your thing, this is a hot book, because it's about a woman revealing all about her sexuality. I enjoyed it. I'm currently reading Abby Lee's Diary of a Sex Fiend: Girl with a One Track Mind. It's the same kind of thing--a woman describing all her sexual thoughts and activities."
2,Meh,"I'm not sure what I expected, but found Ms. Bentley's tale (pun intended, and entirely consistent with the author's excessive use of sophomoric puns and double entendres) less than satisfying. This was mostly an exercise in self-indulgence."
5,use of itchstick,I find itis easy to apply to hot spots which my dog developes from time to time and i like the fact that it soothes her and has a bitter taste which discourages her from licking that spot again.
5,Great Knife,"I bought three of these to complete my Twin Signature Series Henckel's set. This is my BF's favorite knife in the set and my ""go-to"" knife for most tasks. It works like a charm on Tomatoes. I love the look and feel of the knife."
1,Henckels Utility Knife - Don't Buy,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. I was looking for an all-purpose knife that would cut everything from vegetables to bread to meat. After reading good reviews on this particular knife and liking the mid-line price, I decided to purchase it. The knife is very light and flimsy. It is difficult to cut almost everything - I felt as if the knife would break as I was slicing. I usually slice with my forefinger on the back of the blade - which you can't do with this knife, since the back of the blade is pretty sharp. About a month after I purchased this knife, I purchased two trimmers from Cutco - a much better decision!"
1,JC & BBB LIVE & RE-HASHED!!!!!!!,"I have nothing against this cd. I enjoyed it the first time it was released in 1992 as Eddie & The Cruisers LIVE & IN CONCERT on Scotti Bros. I have mixed feelings when a record company (BMG) re-hashes previous recordings in a false format... Extended Versions my ##*****%%%%!!!!! ENCORE COLLECTION my ##****%%%!!! JC & BBB fans would be better served by releasing the soundtrack to the 1992 movie Jersey Girl. I would say re-releasing, but to this day I have never seen a copy of this soundtrack supposedly released with the film. Of course the music is great, it's just the concept is shady... If you have the LIVE & IN CONCERT cd, don't bother with this release. Save your money to see JC live.. He's still touring!!!"
1,LAME,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD EXPECTING TO SEE PRETTY GIRLS IN LINGERIE AND SOME NUDITY, WHILE THE GIRLS ARE CERTAINLY PRETTY, THERE IS VERY LITTLE NUDITY AND IT DOESN'T HOLD YOUR ATTENTION WITH THE LAME STORIES AND LAMER MUSICRANDY"
3,It's okay.,"This video has a nice line-up but the clips are pretty boring overall. Sexy Lingerie 4 & 5 is the best in the series with honorable mention to 3 for some fun clips in my opinion.Day Dream - Shae Marks + Guy - would be better without the guy.Picture Perfect - Tawni Cable, Tiffany Sloane, Wendy Hamilton - descent clipAntique Lace - Julie Cialini, Maria Checa, Brunette - okHotel Deuce - Carrie Westcott + Guy - again better without the guy.En Vogue - Hamilton, Marks (bad hair), Tanya Beyer - ok clip but neat to see Tanya with jet black hair for a few brief moments. To bad this is her only clip. She was the main reason I wanted this one & it was hardly worth it.Naughty & Nice - Sloane & Victoria Zdrok + 2 guys - Sloane had some nice moves.Perfect Ensemble - Checa, Marks, Cialini - good girls, only ok clipWell Suited - Cialini, Checa - probably most fun clip on video?Victoria Secret - Zdrok, Brunette + guy - boring clip with annoying music. Terrible way to end the video."
3,Good background music.,Like most instrumental alblums sometimes they can become background music. This album does it's job but does not inspire much. Except that is for the untitled track 3 which is a masterclass in Ebow guitar. Buy it just for track 3 I say.
2,"Wordy platitudes, some interesting points, no payoff","I recommend that you read the Scientific American review that you can find above. It contains just about everything this book has to offer. The ideas about brain hemispheres are interesting, but you won't learn much more by reading the 300+ pages.The Wisdom Paradox has a very promising premise and the topic is very important and the author has a mighty pedigree, but still the book leaves you emptyhanded. The most infuriating part is the last chapter that describes a program for cognitive fitness, i.e. a way of enhancing your brain power. And that's it: a description! Nothing else. The author doesn't give the reader a single exercise, but he just pats himself on the back for inventing such a wonderful program.You won't become any wiser from this book."
5,An Enjoyable Read,"I came across this book after I read Joe DeLoux'sSynaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are, and it proved to be an enjoyable read. Elkhonon Goldberg has written quite complex information into a very comprehensible direction for the reader in his ""The Wisdom Paradox.""There are fifteen chapters in this book, with an addition of an epilogue. With each chapter, it is more like a personal journey than a simple or dry work. It is both personal and informative.I personally like this book because it adds to my understanding of neuropsychology and neurobiology as it would be a good resourceful book. After reading this book, I find myself feeling compelled to exercise my mind and get those synapse of mine firing. My current skills are limited and useless. However, I can increase my skills by doing what I never done before. Knowledge is indeed unlimited and so is our brain power.In my opinion, I recommend this book."
5,"Reading ""The Wisdom Paradox"" is a wise choice","Highly recommended. A fascinating, well-conceptualized proposition that educates, integrates, and provokes at many levels. Dr. Goldberg's clarity of writing makes intriguing concepts understandable for lay persons, yet challenges experienced neuroscientists to re-think old paradigms. Who wouldn't be interested-from either a personal or professional perspective-in coming to understand how our aging brains change in ""style"", and can be strengthened throughout our lifetime? While there is no guarantee that reading Dr. Goldberg's book will make you wise, reading, understanding, and practising the ""wisdom"" the book offers is certainly a step in the right (or left!) direction.GBS, Saskatoon"
3,Non Fiction,"A look at one particular player's methodology in the past to bet on the NFL, and to sell selections, of course."
1,Not Good,"I would have to rank this book in the bottom 3 of the books I've read on sports betting. JR himself isn't even a legitimate professional gambler, he's just a writer who happens to sell mediocre, long term losing plays on his website. The math method he describes in chapter two is worthless, he claims that that simple method will hit 54% against the spread but it's not true. You won't hit anything higher than 50% using that method.Miller has very little understanding of proper bankroll growth, especially in regards to the kelly criterion. The true title of this book should read, ""how amateur gamblers flip coins against the pointspread"""
1,Basic Drivel Straight From the 70's,"While the fundamentals are here about how lines work and frequent scoring distributions and new fangled inventions such as online betting, what was missing is how to put together more comprehensive models. While it was nice that you needed to be an amateur psychologist to figure out teams, Miller doesn't expand into what things you would look for and how it would exactly affect betting.I'm sure there has to be a more comprehensive text out there. If this book really does help you, you are probably reading it in a Las Vegas bus station after losing your car and shirt."
2,OK beginning,"This text and CD set gives a decent practical introduction to Italian, with clear and manageable grammar information. I would estimate that it is equivalent to a college semester of a language, if you learn this text well.CDs give very clear and lovely examples of Italian conversational speech. One can follow along in the text; this is very helpful.The format of the text, however, makes it somewhat difficult to review, and there isn't even a vocabulary list at the end of each chapter! This is a serious flaw. I would prefer also extensive review exercises at the end of the chapter. Instead, there are only small practice sessions embedded in the the text. I would like this format--it makes it seem manageable--if only there were also review sections at the end."
3,"A good book, but I miss the good old days","This was a good book, and i enjoyed reading it. It had a good plot and good characters. I'm not much of a writer so thats about all I have to say except for I'm getting sick of constructions mechs. I miss the good old days when the fighting involved battle mechs not construction equipment. I miss Super Novas, Mad Cats, Thors, ect.They can't call the book mechwarrior when there are like four actual battlemechs in the story. Plus one was a koshi, and as far as I'm concerned a koshi is just as bad as a construction mech.Thats the only problem I have with these books, aside from the lack of mechs, and actual fighting these books are okay."
2,BattleTech needs to be cleand-up...,"Being a fan of BattleTech for over 10 years, I must say I've seen my share of good and bad novels, soucre books, games, etc... I was not very happy with the new Dark Age setting, as somet things just dont make too much sense (I am still struggling with the fact that some Clans - or maybe all - actually GAVE UP their mechs). I think there is a lack of consistency in this series - and this book. If A. Kerensky is such a good MW, she should have ripped the Paladin apart. Second, the Clans are depicted as rather naive - being tricked very easily. This may have been the case when they first invaded, but even in Classical Btech they learned lessons!! Did they actually FORGET everything? After living in the IS for decades, one would think they'd learn something about the people they live with.The story itself is not bad, but the action is little ridiculus."
4,This book ROCKS,This books rocks. This book gets back to the true nature of Mechwarrior. I can't wait to read the next book!
4,moving to Tucson,"I searched all over for a book on Tucson, and this was the best one my bookstore had to offer. I am excited to see all that the city has to offer, but I wish that this book or any book on Tucson at all, had more about people who are moving to the area and have no idea what to make of the different neighborhoods. They offer brief descriptions, but I would have liked to know more."
4,Nice quick review for a med student,"The information in the book is quite sparse, but it's enough to give a functional overview of OB/Gyn so that as a med student, I didn't appear totally clueless in front of my residents and attendings that first week of the rotation. It's short enough to breeze through over a weekend.I found it absolutely invaluable for the clinical case scenarios at the end of most chapters, which helped greatly for the oral exam I had at the end of my clerkship.But, as I said, it's sparse on details, and I needed other resources to get through the rotation as well."
2,Not a Dance Workout,"I was very disappointed because I was looking for a dance workout. This is more like step aerobics with some dance moves occasionally. Plus, the music was not very motivating- I mean, I know we're getting close to Christmas, but ""The Nutcracker?"" Really? It does offer a total body routine, but definitely not a dance workout. I'll be looking for another video."
2,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this video based on the rave reviews and was very disappointed.The video was very repetative and boring. I was looking for a video for advanced fitness that would be fun and different from other interval videos such as the Firm videos. I found the routines to be very boring and in many of the intervals I didn't even break a sweat. It is very frustrating, because I was really looking forward to this video. I do not recommend this video to anyone who is serious about getting trim and losing weight."
5,Lots of fun!,This was my first Christi Taylor video. I have read many times about how wonderful she cues. I found it to be very true! This DVD was lots of fun with a great variety of music. I am not exactly coordinated when it comes to stepping but I could do this. I can't wait to do it again! I am glad that I didn't wait until Amazon's release.
3,It's OK,I bought this for my sister and she loves it. It gives her a good workout. It came right on time when they said it would.
4,So much fun and great workouts!,"I love Christi's Fit to Dance workout! She makes it a lot of fun and great routines throughout. I do wish she would do another workout DVD more towards a Jazzercise type atmosphere; I can't find any jazzercise related workout dvd's out there, they are all really old and all seem to be renamed as 'dance'. I would buy it in a second if Christi came out with a jazzercise type workout dvd! :)"
5,A real challenge,I loved Christi's basic step video and wanted something a bit more difficult. At first I thought I would never catch on. I did not give up and now this is the workout I look forward to the most!
3,"a little more rock, please",This is a new band for me and my first album of theirs. Overall pretty stocked. I just wish more of their songs were faster. I'm not a big fan of slow songs; I like songs that make you want to boogie and play rippin' air guitar to. The ones that are fast absolutely ROCK and I can't turn up the stereo enough! But I do find that I'll skip songs to get to the rockin' ones. But I will buy another one of theirs.
2,It has all been done before,"Every song on this CD sounds like a song that has been done by some other band in the past. There is nothing unique, cutting-edge or even slightly catchy about this album. Spend your money on something worthwhile like ""Wilco."""
1,"Ouch! Waste of money, horrible musicianship","This album should let the RIAA know why they can't sell music anymore. Crap like this is getting released. These guys simply just drone on with pointless lyrics and no possible coherency to the songs. No wonder BMG was giving this disc away, they couldn't get anyone to buy it!"
4,another gem,"this band had me from the first note i ever heard them play. they're all about the rock show. decoration day creates a unique atmosphere alot like they're southern rock opera album did. the album is solid throughout, no real weak points, it just sounds damn good. if you know this band, you're gonna love this album. if you're not familiar with they're sound yet here's what i can say about it; if all of your stones, skynyrd, allman bros, aerosmith, alice cooper and ac/dc albums are more of a religion to you than just music then these guys are for you. i'm not saying they necessarily emulate any of these bands, it's more like the apple not falling too far from the tree. let it rock everyone. let it rock."
4,Trailer park poets,"Certainly music is a matter of taste and these southern rockers have a uniqueness about them that will separate likers from non-likers quickly. I found myself drawn to the lyrics, which are steeped in a self-loathing white trashness and quite remarkable in their peotic capacity to tell a story. The singers drawl-laden vocals became not only tolerable, but a necessary component to the songs' emotive qualities. The tempo and tone of this music is predominantly set at dirge, which is OK based on the underlying sense of sarcasm but is (for me) the reason I did't rate this CD excellent."
3,Putco H3 chrome antenna base cover,"It was very difficult to install. It looks as though it will just snap on, but I was unable to get it to do that until I filed down the opening that goes over the antenna. I had to make it bigger in order for it to clear the width of the antenna base. Then it suddenly snapped on, but now, because that opening is slightly bigger, it reveals a little more of the plastic underneath. I guess it was worth the price--about 1/2 of the GM product. So if you buy this one and have the same problem, don't give up. You can file it down pretty quick."
2,Low price for a mixed bag!,"The price was right for this European music mix; however there are too many music types mixed together with songs that weren't that popular here in the states, or popular by different artists. For that reason I'd suggest that anyone (considering buying this item) check the complete listing of songs and performers before purchasing."
2,Not like other Lord of the Rings,"If you have played Lord of the rings 1,2, or 3 this game is completely different, you dont attack and parry or anything! you just take turns killing the other guy and him killing you so this game is really boring because its more strategy than action and adventure"
1,total crud,"when i first rented this game, i was so exited that another lord of the rings games were out. but it wasn't like the others.i hate games that you have to take turns, and this was one of them.i played this for 5 min. and was thinking,""this is a load of crap"".im just gonna stick to the other lord of the rings games such as the two towers instead of this crud"
2,Run all day long,"I got this a few days back and I must say ""DO NOT BUY"". Sure, you battle a couple of foes, but you probably NEVER will finish this game. You'll waste more than $10, so DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!>:("
5,The Third Age,"*Whistles* Wow! This game is going to be gooooood! This game takes place through the trilogy in which your team of Men, Elves, Dwarves, (and hopefully Hobbits), track the footsteps of the Fellowship. Sometimes in the game, you actually get to fight with the Fellowship! This also isn't what you recognize as the hack-and-slash games from TT and ROTK. This is a Roleplaying game (Like Final Fantasy.). This will be my first RPG but I'm still dying to get it! You get to choose which side you want, the good...or evil. I can't wait for this game! A must-have for Tolkien fans and RPG fans. Once you start, you can't stop!"
3,boring,"i was really exited when I rented this game, thinking it was going to be yet another fun Lord of the Rings games.But I was sadly mistaken.I waasn't expecting it to be an RPG game,so after 10 minutes of playing it,I was bored to death.If your collecting the Lord of the Rings games, I suggest that you don't include this one.the reason i gave it 3 stars is because it was fun for about 5 minutes, but then it became stupid.I'm just sticking to the other Lord of the Rings games because those are actually fun."
3,Not the best,it at the same time has too much and too little fighting. you have to do alot of exploring but at random times you will enter a fight.
1,where have all the real characters gone?,"i did not like it at all. almost no relation to movies or book. no characters from the book and bad story. and, instead of running down the road into a band of orcs, a big green thing will apper, and you'll be in a fight. highly disrecomend it."
2,could be much better,i rented this game from a block buster and i hated it! i would recomemnd you rent it before you buy it to see it yourself. i mean u don't play it like the other lort games. this game stinks! ( i'm a big lort fan and i think this game stinks! )
2,MIGHT AS WELL PLAY IN THE DARK,"Lord of the rings......by far my favorite movie/game/music in the world. this game, has most of that. the graphics are really good. the attacking is kinda like final fantasy/pokemon stadium. BUT before you start saying ""cool i want this game"" you cant see a thing!!!! i rented this game and everthing is fine....until you get to the mines of moria. you cant see anything!!!!!! you have to look at the minimap 24/7. this is a really dissapointing game."
5,A great game,"This game is awesome. The graphics are incredible, the plot is good, it doesn't have much to do with the movie, but who cares?It has great character customization. Of the 6 characters you get, each one can get hundreds of different equitment(armor, weapons,...). Each character can learn around 30 skills and can level up 100 times (at least). The characters are all vey different and specialize in different things. As you complete quests and get things you can unlock little clips of film. A lot of times they wern't in the movie and are pretty interesting. I guess the point of them is to tell you what's going on other parts of middle earth at the time.Another cool part is that when you complete a chapter you can replay certain battles from that level as evil.The one downside of this game is that it is short. The game is 2 disks, so I thought it would be long, but ther is really only 9 long levels.This game is very fun, and a must buy."
3,Okay but not the best,"The games overall okay but but it has a few bad things, such as on evil mode you cant move all you do is fight over and over and the heroes do stuff you cant do yet. Its also stupid when youre sorrunded by 6 enimies on hero mode and you have 6 guys but you can only use three and the enimies are all attacking twice. It also horribly diffrent from the movie when you do stuff like help eowyn kill the witch king(yah id like to see that in the movie) and help gandolf kill the balrog in moria. It does have a few good things though like customizing your guys( even through its not really customizing like they say you can, its just sticking on new armor). And it has decent graphics and you get to go someplaces the fellowship goes. But overall if you didnt like the lotr movies or games stay away.But personally even if you do like lotr its still not worth your time."
1,BORING!!!!,"I got this game thinking yes a new lord of the rings game. But it is nothing like the first to. In the first to you get to attack any bad guy when ever you want to. In this game you and the other people ""Take Turns"" attacking. And half the time your people miss. (...)"
4,A Bit Long...,"I love all things Lord Of The Rings. This game is great, if a bit hard at the start. The graphics are some of the best and most realistic I've seen on Nintendo in a long time. The only thing that bugs me is that you have to switch discs halfway through the game. I know that this is because of the intensive graphics and sound effects, but it's still annoying. All in all, this is an amazing game and probably one of the top two LOTR games I've ever played !"
2,Disappointing,"I rented this game hoping it would be like to Knights of the Old Republic...I was dead wrong.The weapons, spells, and whatnot look pretty cool, and the landscape look nice. The games weakest point is its storyline. From the view of an avid LOTR fan, its ludicrous. It begins okay, but around Helm's Deep and Osgiliath, the plot worsens until the end. The script is painful to hear.Bpttom Line: RPG and LOTR fans might want to rent this, but anyone not wishing to see the most ridiculous final boss fight of all time night want to skip this."
3,lacks a lot of RPG qualities,"this game is kinda fun but gets dull after doing the same thing over and over. the game lacks buying and selling items. also you can only have 3 characters fighting at once. it's nice that it tells you when you are getting close to a fight but it takes away the fun of suddenly running into a fight unprepared. the story is really stupid and sort of ruins the movies. if you like RPG's don't play this game it will destroy your heart, I would recommend final fantasy games or morrowind."
2,"long, boring","thought it would have been more in depth of the ocean floor, instead it was a lot of talking, they dropped the ocean level several times instead of all at once and being able to look at all of floor at once. bought for myself and my kids ages 8 and 10, they found it boring."
3,Good graphics but a little dry,I bought this to help teach my 5th graders about the ocean floor. The graphics are good but it is a little dry for students.
2,Good video,This DVd bored me on multiple occassions. I triedto watch it without going to sleep but I could not.I tried multiple times
5,The best overall D&B CD I've ever heard!,"This CD is the ish! Too bad I found out about it so late. It has all of the elements, from the cosmic analog sounds, to the cool samples to the FILTHY beats. It's 2004, and this is still the best CD, (although I have yet to listen to SMB). I have now ordered all of his other CD's. I can't wait!"
1,A very bad and disappointing product.,"As a big fan of Star Wars I would have expected that this CD contained an audio version of the movie, but instead this is a poor pretext for another licensed product."
2,TRIGGERING,Please do not read this book if you are in the midst or in recovery from an ED. The author's journey through her ED describes habits and tricks that will be triggering to you.
2,casket for sale (only used once),"I was at first, fascinated by the title. In the beginning the author's combination of humor and gore made for a good read. About half way through the book, however, it gets tiresome and eventually boring. I managed to finish it, but it was an effort."
3,It's Pretty Okay,"Overall a decent product for road navigation. I use it with my Dell Axim X50v PDA. My only complaint is that it's only really usefull for roadtrips. Don't think of taking this thing Geocaching, camping, hiking, or backpacking. There's no topographical map support unless you buy third party software (and hope it works). The Ostia software could also be a little more user friendly. Getting a signal can be tricky at times too."
4,a step in the right direction,"As a person trying to learn Vietnamese relatively late in life (age 23), this book has been great in answering my questions about the Vietnamese language. The long section up front about the linguistics will be tough as it is much less intuitive than classroom instruction. There is a fair amount of vocabulary available (which will take more effort than the text suggests), but the book's glossary will hardly be a reference in real life. Also, the author fully notes how he will use the Northern dialect, so the Southern and Central dialects will be lacking.I bought this book as a cheaper introduction than those packages with many CDs, and the text has satisfied my intentions well."
2,missing pieces,"Upon reading the introduction, I discovered there was an audio CD to accompany the book that was not provided (standard). I wrote to the author and was informed that, for [money](+... shipping), I could buy the audio CD's directly from him.As far as a textbook quality goes, I cannot rate it accurately because I have not used it fully. Upon first and subsequent impressions, it is much more complex than texts in the romance languages, which probably should be expected. It seems to offer very little support for slow learners like me.I rate the book with two stars because I desire to give it the benefit of the doubt (due to all of it's other wonderful reviews)."
5,Indispensable Resource,"Dr. Ngo's Elementary Vietnamese is quite simply the finest Vietnamese text book on the market. Period. As a Vietnamese Studies major I am familiar with a number of text books and am convinced that Dr. Ngo's text is superior to all others. Believe it or not, many Vietnamese texts date back to the 1960s. Dr. Ngo's text teaches the modern Hanoi dialect. If you intend to learn Vietnamese for business or study, this is the dialect to learn, and Elementary Vietnamese is the book to use."
3,Careful when appiying,"The tape is very delicate. When you are ironing it on it will shift if you are not careful, also when removing the excess form the edge it has a tendency to tear so I use a fine file, Other than that it does the job."
3,"Decent material, but redundant.","This was a mandatory purchase for a class, and although I did learn some new things from the book most of the material is repeated to frequently. I think the book would be great at 50 pages and less expensive. The other thing is that many of the ideas in the book are common sense, and are just renamed into catchphrases. At the sheer number of pages in the book I guess I was hoping for a little more content, and fresh material."
2,Out of date,"This was a pretty good book, but the information now is quite dated. LiPo batteries and brushless motors are the standard now, electrics have come a long way."
3,Good overview but needs more flight time,"Given that most beginning RC aviators will fly planes that are factory built, too much time is given to model construction rather than the basics of understanding aerodynamics and the use of flight controls."
4,Ice Cream: Thirty of the Most Interesting Skaters in History,"Fans of Toller Cranston's other books will have some idea of what to expect here. Toller isn't frightened to say what he thinks or be controversial! As it says in the introduction - take your blood pressure pills skating fans. I found it a great read, and Toller's obvious love for the sport/art of figure skating and its history shines through. You may not agree with the opinions he has of some of the skaters listed but he expresses his opinions in a very entertaining way. Martha Kimball as always provides good introductory factual information on each skater before Toller lets loose!"
4,Convenient but pricey,"This is a good product and slightly thicker than 3/4"" veneers.The thing I object to is the total price after shipping. I can buy this for $19.30 at a fancy, somewhat local store, but I use $8.00 worth of gas. Still I save $4.00, but am out an hour's time and wear and tear on the car.It's almost like they've figured that out! I think the price is a little inflated, at $23.00 ($3.70 or 20% more), but that's convenience for you, right?"
4,Bold and Brassy,"You either like the sound of brass instruments or you don't. I do. I especially like them in the hands of competent musicians playing tunes I like (mostly), I like this album.It's a hodgepodge of mostly very short pieces and not all of them are ""classical"" although that is the main thrust of the work. Intermixed with Handel's MUSIC FROM THE ROYAL FIREWORKS and Ravel's BOLERO you will find such pieces as the CAN-CAN or GLOWWORM. It's all very enjoyable."
3,it took me back home.....,"I was given this book by an old high school friend -- which introduced me to the encryption of the names in the book -- afterwards I was able to easily recognize the names and cities referred to in the storyline. The names and descriptions of the various locations are true to the region. My next trip to ""Beckerton"" will definitely include asking about the case upon which this is based..... as far as quality, the text lacks standard proofing, but the story is substantial and easily holds ones interest."
4,Zapan is Back to hunt Alita,Angel of Redemption - Hunter-Warrior Zapan comes after Alita for revenge. Will our Battle Angel give herself up as a scapegoat to save her friends and other innocents?
1,Not a useful book.,I'm a new user to Flash and for the most part the book put me in a coma when I tried to follow the examples (drawing tutorial was particularly painful to get through). The online tutorials and lessons provided by Macromedia are so much more helpful. I personally think this book should have been recalled because of the missing tutorial files. Author should at least post a url where we can download the missing files. Sorry for being so critical but that book cost too much to ignore the flaws. A nice looking cover design and some eye catching color page inserts probably tricked a lot of shoppers into taking this book home. Too bad the content wasn't better thought out.
2,Disappointed,"The missing contents from the CD is a major flaw. I spent far too much time drawing the graphics in Flash then actually following instruction from the book. Though drawing the clip arts did help establish some skill in the drawing tools of flash.However, the instructions were sub-par. I felt as if several steps were missing and the explanations were not clear. Many of the instructions were repetitive.I've already gone through one basic flash book. The alluring graphics in the cover and pages made it seem like I can take a step up to at least the intermediate level (the type of step one could use to get a job! ) Unfortunately, it did not.Sorry, I'm glad I borrowed this book from a friend rather than buying it."
4,Another point of view.,Since Macromedia allready have the best manuals I have encountered books on the subject have to be extremly good to be of any use. This wasnet the case with this book but rather it made me look at flash from another poit of view. It helped me and gave me a fresh go in my design.
2,Disappointed,"I needed to learn Flash quick, so rushed out and found only this book. It was quite a disappointment. I felt it dwelled far too much on drawing in Flash. I actually spent half a day playing with Flash and learnt more than I ever could than if I learnt from this book. Also as other people have mentioned, the CD was awful...I couldn't find the turorial files anywhere."
1,Do your tutorials,"If you complete the online tutorials you have covered all the information in this book. I found the only useful thing in this book was the limited sample links. These showed me what others have done and what is already out there, but if you are interested in seeing some really cool sites just visit the Macromedia web site for links. If you learn the tutorials and have any creativity and vision you dont need this book"
1,"Companion files are not on the cdrom, where is the clipart?","I thought this was going to be better than the other Flash 3 book. I just received this book. Where are the files mentioned in the book? I can't locate them on the cd rom. Page 79 - swan.png Page 88 - dragon.eps Page 106 - skater.png These files are supposed to be on the companion cd rom. I am a little disappointed. I thought this book was supposed to be better than ""Flash 3 Creative Web Animation"" by Darrel Plant? I can't recommend this book to anyone!!! You guys forgot to put the clipart and other files on the cdrom!!!"
2,No light in this Book for Flash,"The Book: Much more (and this is no joke) could be learned from the well designed demo tutorial which comes with the Flash 3.0 program. This book is just an expensive reiteration of what you get for free with the program.The CD: On a Macintosh level, there are only demo programs which you could download from Macromedia.com for free. Occasionally, the book would ask you to import a certain file that's to be used w/the tutorial and *NOT ONE* was present in the CD. - go figure!Overall: I believe that the authors should first read through the tutorials that Macromedia provides and then publish something that would actually be better."
3,Great for beginner/intermediate!,"Most of these reviews stress how bad of a dissapointment this book is, and how you can get all the info out of the tutorial. I somewhat agree, if you buy the book you are getting the lessons on paper and don't have to read them on your computer monitor, and yes it does indeed help out alot, there are things in here that aren't in the tutorial. For the ones who were whyning about not being able to use flash in there page. You should try implementing your flash movies in dreamweaver. It works great, its not that hard. This book is well written. You guy do realize Flash is for the advanced computer user don't you? Most of you don't act like you are. I've been doing graphic design and web animation for 2 years...maybe thats why I think Flash is easy. But for all you beginners in Flash, I suggest you pick up a copy of this book."
1,Useless!,I bought a couple graphic design books from The Coriolis Group before. They are all not good. I read this book at the bookstore instead of wasting my money. This book is not well organized! The information inside is far less useful than many online Flash tutorial sites. Too bad there are only a few Flash book in the market and all of them are useless. Maybe this is still a new software and there are not that many smart Flash designers around.
1,Missing files and tech support!,"what disappoints me most are the missing sample files in the cdrom. i e-mailed their tech-support but there was no response.Mr. Milburn and Ms. Warner, your book was neatly written but are there any recalls for the cdrom please?"
1,Very Disappointed,This is the most disappointing book for flash users! very poor with exe. from the cd'.
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this book with the idea that I would be able to post a ""Flashed"" web page. WRONG!! The book runs you through a bunch of crap that you can glean from the online tutorials. This same information is reiterated later in the book and most of the examples leap over obvious steps (leaving you to scratch your head and figure out). I don't even want to get in to the missing files that were left off of the CD that accompanies the book!! My advice - use the online tutorials and then visit other flash sites, you'll get more out of them..."
3,A good intro... but does it compare to web tutorials?,"I've only completed about half of this book so far and I must say that it's neither a great book nor a terrible on Flash 3.0.I'm just learning Flash, so as a beginner's guide it serves it purpose. But I've been seeing some awesome flash sites out there on the web and see no sections in this book that describes more advance techniques.... so I'm somewhat disappointed in this regard.My advice, download the 30 day version of Flash from the Macromedia website and do the turtorial and lessons that come with it. Then go to the various websites that have tutorials, they are more advance and updated than the ones in the book.One major plus is that the this book comes with a 30 day version of Flash, so for those who have slow internet access, you don't have to deal with the slow download of the 12meg Flash download. Plus this trial version has a tutorial with it, which I found easier to use than and learn than the book itself."
1,This book costs $10 more than Darrel Plant's book!,This book costs $10 more than Darrel Plan'ts book and it's missing a lot of clipart. Save your money and use the Flash tutorials found on the Internet!
1,"more like ""Flash for kindergarten""","This book is supposedly written for advanced users...well, IT'S NOT! An entire chapter is devoted to ""other"" sites that use flash but this book is so basic that you will be clueless if you would like to do the same.Bottom line: this book is a mockery if you're interested in learning advanced techniques that will leave surfers in awe. Flash is an extremely powerful program and you only learn the a,b,c's with this coloring book.Save your money till something more meaningful comes out and for the meanwhile, the demo's that come with the program are all you need."
1,A tutorial rehash by any other name....,"There is very little in this book that isn't effectively covered in the Flash manual or the online tutorials. In addition, the breathless ""Golly Gee, isn't Flash swell"" tone of the book gets irritating rather quickly.In addition, the missing CD-ROM content, and the lack of any truly advanced topic coverage make for a frustrating experience.Save your money, and check out some of the only resources for Flash first!"
2,don't be in a dusty environment,"I had purchased the G-Pack Console Case and it is a good setup for environments that don't have high dust issues, it is made up of good durable material that alot of airport travel bags are made of. (you can use the PS3 in the case and it has a area to carry a good bit of the accessories but it doesn't have room for the PS3 intercooler). You have to completely take the PS3 out of the case to use the PS3 if you are using intercooler. If the seller had mentioned that I wouldn't have bought it. The company needs to redo the design of the case to include that feature and increase the accessorie compartment. All I have is 1 controller, charge link, DVD remote, power coard and the AV cable and it is completely full."
2,Why there is a hole at the bottom of the bag?,"I got this bag for my PS3. Everything seems OK. But I don't understand why there is a hole at bottom of the bag. It is inconvenient to carry the case. I am so afraid, that my new PS3 would fall through that bottom hole."
3,Great Concept - Not fully Thought Through,"It seemed as though they thought of everything, e.g., a place for the controllers, cables, games and their manuals. Unfortunately, after the first time I used it I realized what they hadn't thought of. The placement of the CD holder sleeve on the panel that sits above the PS3 without enough spacing between them led to the surface of the PS3 to get scratched up. Not good! I recommend you place a towel or pad on the PS3 before you close the case to avoid this."
4,Great case!,"This is such a great case! It is very easy to transport from one house to the next and you can even play directly from the case! You just need to undo the bottom velcro, plug in the cords, and you are good to go! There is ventilation on the sides of the case so your PS3 doesn't over heat. I suggest placing a towel between the velco scraps that hold in the PS3, and actual PS3 itself to prevent scratching. The material inside is very soft, and the outside is a thicker, harder material. A negative is that it doesn't seem to hold my dvds/games in the case very well, they slide around and sometimes slip out when I open the case. Otherwise it's a great case and I'd recommend it for people who transport their PS3 alot.Edit 02/09/08: Still in good condition, and I have yet to take it out of the case since purchase!!!"
3,Sturdy Case for PS3 - Except Zippers Don't Work Smoothly,This is a sturdy and well constructed case except for the following:the zippers don't work smoothly when they get to the top of the case.This is quite a shame because everything else about the case is excellent.
4,A Good Carrying Case,A fairly good carrying case for you PS3 system. The only negative I have is that my DVD's don't always stay in the pocket slots. The peripheral pouch is good but might have been better if it was a little bigger. But overall it's a good case.
4,works as expected,"Its a well made case works as expected, there is nothing so fancy about it.There are pockets for game cds, PS3 wireless controlers and other stuff. A good to have case keeps your PS3 safe and away from getting scratched."
4,I'd Buy again!,I bought this because I was tired of traveling with the PS3 box and it was beginning to fall apart anyways. Overall I am VERY happy with this product. Its simple and does what it needs to do. I didn't give it a five because I have these two observations which are slight shortcomings but don't compromise my satisfaction that much. 1. The games sleeves are extremely way to lose. Not a single game stays in their compartment unless you double them up. Second: This carrier has two velcro straps that hold the PS3 down against side-to-side shifting but not one that stops back and forth movement. Because of that the PS3 shifts a bit and you need to be carful when you first unzip it after traveling.
4,Good case,"Over all this is a good sturdy carrying case. The PS3 fits well in it and the Velcro straps keep it in. You can put four controllers in the top pocket, but there is no room to spare. I put my cords in the case after zipping it up most of the way. The two main grips I have with this case are One- the air is some what restricted while the PS3 is in the case so I always take it out. And Two- I don't like the disk holder. I think that it is a good as they can make it given the case and the fact that it will be in several potions but I have had my disks fall out a couple of times. Overall this is a good case that will serve you well."
4,You can feel it,I took it 3 tablets per day before work out and is more than enough for your goals if you going constantly
5,HamuHamu's Sing!,"This is a great CD! The songs are both upbeat and entertaining. Of course, it's all in Japanese (including the written lyrics,) but if you listen to it enough, you can sing along. Contains: ""Tottoko Hamutaro"" in several different versions; ""200% no Jumon"", the ending song; ""Happy Hamuhamu Birthday""; ""Ai no Uta"" by the Minihamuzu; ""No Kekkon""(Wedding Song)with the Minihamuzu, and even better, the Mohamuzu; and a whole lot more.I love this CD, and I am 62 years old. It helps, though, if you know Hamtaro well."
4,ALL CLASSIC,"The best songs of DR DRE, SNOOP DOGGY DOGG, RUN DMC, MC HAMMER, HOUSE OF PAIN in one cd? Ya it's real, the best 90's songs of hip hop in this album the best greathest hits in the millenium. ""all classic"""
5,"Remembering Jr.high, high school & college days!","This is a great compilation of music that brings back great memories, not to mention the ultimate ""get ready to go out"" music."
4,OLD SKOOL,Very Good Cd if you want some OLDER songs Snoop and Dre on there from back in the day I reccomend this cd to any old Skool Best song on the cd ....... HUMPTY DANCE
5,The only CD you'll ever need,"This CD gets the party started and the party don't stop til you turn it off! It's (almost) more fun than Erich's mom putting on chaps after a few shots of tequila.MHHP is the best CD ever compiled, and that is not an exaggeration.Buy it. Cherish it. Love it. Share it."
4,"Some filler, but very good","A few of the songs are forgettable (read ""filler""), but the rest is great. I can't add much that hasn't already been said."
1,Too much pop.,"When I got this album, I still had a love for rap, and I had high expectations for this album. Eventually I discovered that the same people who bought this album bought stuff by BSB. When I got it, I thought that the album would be full of hardcore stuff. Rather, I found it littered with overrated pop-rap, stuff which I'm sure no one likes. As I did with ""Big Willie Style"", I eventually gave it away, since it is obviously worth nothing."
1,a terrible cartoon,"This video features the adventures of two Hispanic youngsters and, now get this, a talking, magical Rubik's Cube(You know, the puzzle thing from the 1980s?). Rubik the Amazing Cube spoke like he had a mental handicap, with the annoying characteristic of referring to himself(or itself?) in the third person. The only good memories I have of this cartoon are that of me and my best friend making snarky remarks about it ahla MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 back when it aired on television in the 1980s."
3,I keep going back to Ousterhout,"This reference is good if you are only looking for syntax or available options to a command you understand.If you have questions about the way the commands work, or the concepts behind them (what is a list?) then you'll find that you keep going back to the larger books.So I am currently in Ousterhout for most of my questions and then opening this infrequently to check syntax.I think it could have had a more extensive index and I cannot see any order in the table of contents."
4,Young Adults Enjoy This Book by Linda Post,"The story is from real life and one young high school boys decisions. Based upon comments by middle and high school students, they enjoy story and read the book from cover to cover.Several schools in Bell County, Texas include the book in the English class reading options."
3,Renzo Gracie,This tape is sweet cause it features Renzo Gracie. A kind of unknown Gracie. But don't look for any UFC excitment in this video. But nice if you like having Gracie members besides Royce and Rickson on tape.
5,Country Music The Way Country Should Be,"Country Music has somehow been derailed by Nashville and Radio lately leaving the true and loyal fans nothing! This release by David Frizzell is something that the true Country Music fan can appreciate and enjoy, telling of the American way of life in the same fashion as his Legendary brother Lefty and many other pioneers had done for many years. This is a great listen!!"
1,Brush scratches tub,"This brush scratched my new tub within 2 weeks of buying it. I contacted Fuller Brush company to arrange a refund and return. They would not provide a large box or return postage. Therefore, I would have had to buy a box and pay return postage. Not worth it!"
2,Of little use to the average user,"I think this title is probably okay for an absolute beginner in computing. The author forgets, however, that most users of GNOME already at least know Windows."
4,Very nice low power eyepiece.,"This is my go to eyepiece when I get my scope out. Nice wide field of view and very clear. The rubber cup keeps my eyeglasses from hitting the hard plastic. Good price, great value."
2,Buy the 32mm instead of the 40mm,"Celestron's 40mm Omni is not a bad eyepiece but its field of view is almost 10 degrees less than Celestron's Omni 32mm eyepiece, so they both give approximately the same view except for an increase in magnification with the 32mm. I purchased both of these and I never have any need to use the 40mm. The 32mm is also cheaper."
3,I wanted to like this eyepiece,"I bought this eyepiece to use with my 4.5"" f/8 Celestron telescope, but I also have a 10"" f/4.7 Orion telescope. I have found that this eyepiece works well in the slower scope, where it gives bright, sharp images. However, it is not up to the task in my faster f/4.7 scope. In the faster scope the view is on the dim side and a lot less sharp. I wish I had bought a 32mm Orion Highlight eyepiece rather than this one."
5,Great Product.,"Great Product,I highly recommend it.Now I can see Clusters upon Clusters of Stars With great Clearity,And I'm only using a 70mm Celestron Telescope.....""Celestron Powerseeker 70EQ""......"
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"I don't normally write negative reviews about movies, as they are subjective to the viewer. However, this is one of the worst American movies I have seen though. The acting was awful, the fight choreography was terrible (it resembled a comedy spoof), the storyline is never really developed or explained, and the camera work was just plain bad. Normally I love this genre of movie and am quite forgiving, but make no mistake, this is a very poorly made movie. The only good thing about the movie is it's cover art."
2,"Mechanical Tach, not electric!","This tachometer needs a spinning wire to show RPM's.I did not know it existed, but this tach does not show RPM's via an electronic connection, but a mechanical wire, just like the old school speedometers.Don't buy this, if your bike does not support an RPM connection.The picture is incorrect.On the Honda Shadow 750, you will need the electronic version of this tach!I will return it, and order the electronic version!"
3,Questionable prices,"I was a bit surprise to see that Overstreet quoted some of my collection at the same value as the one published in the monthly comic magazine Wizard. It's be widely known that Wizard tends to overestimate the value of comics so as to drum up interests for anew generation of collectors, but it is shocking to see Overstreet, a trusted publication since the invention of comics, to use the same pricing techniques as Wizard.If one take the time to do price research on Ebay and other popular auction sites, one would see that most comics can be had for a fraction of what Overstreet is stating in value. Newcomers to the world of comics should take the prices quoted in Overstreet with skepticism.The positive aspect of the Overstreet Price Guide is it gave a most comprehensive catalogue of comics published since the turn of the 20th century to today."
3,Paperback Poor Quality Binding.,Iv'e had several Paperback Overstreet Guides and after moderate use pages tend to come loose from the binding and the book becomes worthless as a resale not to mention trying to keep it together. The Hardbacks seem to hold up much better and are more desirable as a collector item. For the additional price I find it is worth going with the Hardback version. I have never found Amazon.Comm to offer the Hardback and I don't know why??
1,this is for the vendor Hooktown Games,He sold me a game that said in very good condition and was very badly scratched.I do not know if it will play I have yet to try it out.
2,Golden flop,"OK you have to admit that this game has it's good moments, but I would have thought that with the success of ""All or Nothing"" and the failure of Angelfire that all of the Bond games would have followed the obvious pattern of ""All or nothing"". The part that I really hate is the fact that you have to shoot the guys 10 or more times to get a hit and they run around like a bunch of panzies while you're shooting at them. OK, I expect them do do a certain bit of running around, but after a while it gets to be like a game of ""ring around the rosies"". While the game does have it's enjoyable moments, it's not as enjoyable as it could have been. Hopefully the next game, they'll do better."
4,Good Game,"It's a very fun shooting game. If you like any of the 007 games, this is pretty much the same exact thing,just with Golden Eye instead of Bond."
4,Great Bond Game,"This isn't the best Bond game, but yet, a great game. I like the duel weapon feature that EA Games added in also. It could be a little better by not having the levels so long. Hong Kong was much too long. The levels that were perfect were Fort Knox, Artic Enterprises, The Casino, and Crab Key. Of all, I think Crab Key was the best because of the nice placing of checkpoints, and of the great combinations of weapons. (MAGRAILS ARE SWEET, DUDE!) The other thing is that I think it is to cheap that on the last level, one shot on you with the OMEN XR, you get erased from history, you gone, you dead, you... you get the idea. EA Games has done such a great job with this Bond game. I can't wait for the next one! Bravo!!!"
1,This is a horrible game!,"I had been looking forward to this title since it was announced. However, upon playing it I was horrified to see it was a cheap version of Halo 2. The dual weapons, the recharging health, even the weapons and controls are alike. I was hoping for a classic Golden Eye or Nightfire type multi-player gameplay, but this more like a generic run and gun game. There are no bots, you can only carry two weapons at a time, you can't aim at all with most weapons, and there was no jump button. The powers you do get are stupid and pointless. The level design and graphics were terrible. The colors were like a cartoon and the game itself was glitchy. It seems EA just rushed to get this out and took little time with it. They probably spent more on advertising than the game itself. I rented it with my friends and played two matches, then we played 007 Nightfire. If you like Golden Eye you are better off just getting a N64 [...]"
1,Certifiable Piece of Crap,"EA has ruined the Bond franchise as far as I am concerned. Don't be confused that since it shares a name with the 1996 Goldeneye title for the N64 that it is good.First off lets establish one thing about this game, that you are supposedly a bad guy. But instead of doing bad guy things like robbing banks and blowing up things that make civilians tremble and fear you, you just go around fighting Dr. No another bad guy. So in reality you are just a pseudo goodguy.The entire point of the game is to run from point A to point B killing a legion of bad guys with the same four guns. The levels are long and legnthy and often hideously pointless, because as I've established before you don't do anything except escape or get to point B. Classic Doom is more fun then this.So if your thinking about buying this game - Don't save yourself the money and treat yourself to a body piercing in a sensitive place, as it will be more enjoyable then playing this game."
2,"Hard game, bad controls.","What could have been a great game is ruined by the difficulty mostly due to the bad controls, although the same game might perhaps be better on a different platform."
3,Well-worth playing and buying!,"This starwars game may not be gaming gold, but atleast its bronze! It is pretty fun, and you can go into space battles, and use jedis, and a bunch of other stuff. The downfall is the AI, the selection, and just maybe the graphics. The AI is not vey good. If a tank hovers buy, everyone will chuck grenades and then run up to them, and forget sniping and strategy. There always moving. And for galatic-conquest and instant acction, there are so few planets! No geonosis, no coroscaunt (sorry about spelling), no utapau, and only two space battles. What I'm trying to say is that this game is good and quite fun, but could be much better."
3,SWBF2 Does some things right for the PSP.,"Graphics: 7/10. The graphics for this game are really nothing bad, but they are nothing special. They are just, ""okay"". They are a bit bland and don't show off any of the PSP's capabilities graphically.Sound: 8/10. This game sounds exactly like the console versions in every way. It obviously has the Star War's theme, but it also has other Star Wars songs, and great overall sound.Control: 6.5/10. This game also proves that the PSP would be a lot better if it just had that extra analog nub. There are a lot of different ways to change the controls for this game, but they take time to get used to, and even a SWBF/SWBF2 console player would have to get used to these controls.Fun: 6.5/10. Star Wars Battlefront 2 for the PSP does some things right, but most things wrong. If you are a Star Wars fan, rent this game, but if you have a PS2, Xbox, or PC, definitely just buy that version instead; unless you want Star Wars on the road.6.7/10"
4,quite good,This game is pretty good when I first got it I was really exited.The graphics are not the best and I played this on PS2 and it was better.I would by this but try to get it for a cheaper price.
5,Star Wars Battlefront II,I bought this for my son (12) and he just loves it! He said the characters sound a lot like they do in the movie.
1,There are better 3rd person point and shoot games out there.,"I am an active and experienced gamer and I found it difficult to navigate and spot enemies. Graphics are mediocre, however I feel that way about the full size game as well. Campaign is way too difficult. You start with nothing and get sniper'd easily. Quick battle is fun and has a better feature then the full size game by which you can become a Jedi fairly quickly. Overall, there are far better point-and-shoot games for the PSP."
2,Star Wars,Good price and super fast shipping but the game sucks. The characters are hard to maneuver and I pretty much gave up on after a day.
5,My son loves this game,I bought this for one of my boys because he loves Star Wars. He said it is a fun game.
5,Game Rocks,This is a great game with plenty of challenges and levels. Graphics are great and it is easy to jump right in. Love it!
4,Housedawg,The game was pretty good. The only problem I experienced were the controls. The controls are pretty hard to learn. The other thing was that there isn't hardly and tracks avaliable for play.
2,"good, but not great","this game was an alright buy for me since i found a used one for much less. I wouldnt pay the retail on it though. The gameplay itself is pretty fun if you are into battlefield 2 and battlefront 2. The loading times are a hamper(about 30 seconds, after you customize your round) and do prevent the game from being a pick up and play game. It is a fun game but doesnt seem to wow you after you play and make you want to go play again, nor is it very addictive. The units can upgrade to become a jedi in this game. The Jedis are very annoying and tottally dominate the battlefield so i recommend turning them off.I would say it is one of the better psp games out there, but dont pay full price for this product."
5,My 9 y.o son loves this game,My son played this non stop for about a week after he got it. He is still enjoying it.
1,What were these people thinking?,"This is the second Star Wars game that has been hyped up and completely falls short of it. I bought Knights of the Old Republic a few months back after being constantly urged by friends to experience ""an awesome game"". The controls were horrible the experience was completely non-linear, and it was an overall abysmal experience. So the legacy continued with Battlefront. There is NO story. The controlls are HORRIBLE. Its like some little kid took his Star Wars toys from the last six movies threw them up in the air and they landed on a PSP disc with broken arms and legs."
1,time and money wasted.,"i bought this game because i was looking for a good shooter and i kinda like star wars, as soon as started playing it, it felt weird the player moved wait too fast, the aim its horrible, and i dont even know if it has a story, since the game its so bad, i only played for 5 minutes and then got it out of my psp,so in other words i ended up wasting my time and my money, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
2,somewhat a disappointment,"Star Wars Battlefront lacks the certain features a gamer willappreciate. For instance,the controls. If you are runningaround trying to complete a mission, you don't have time toplay around with the triangle,square,circle,and X buttons.It's just annoying! Why couldn't it have target lock andanalog stick control? The only reason mosy people say it'sa great game is because they don't want to admit that their$50 went down the drain! Sure,it's got it's ups(like goodgraphics,neat weapon selection,and dark side/good side choice).If you want a good shoot-em-up game,I would stronglyrecommend Grand Theft Auto(Liberty City Stories). Also, avery good game that recently came out about 2,3 weeks ago(GodForbid!) is SSX On Tour-only if you like snowboarding."
2,Terible graphics,not much fun terrible graphics i liked the orriginal battlefront for ps2 much better
1,Horrendous,"After all the hype, I purchased this game for my new PSP. I must say, this is the worst game I have ever purchased...ever! There is no story...in fact, there's nothing resembling any kind of direction or clue as to what you have to do, save for a small, vague blurb at each mission. Furthermore, when playing a mission, you spend 80% of the time just figuring out what you're supposed to accomplish! You die WAY too easily, which makes this game frustrating from the start. If you complete all the missions, you get nothing...absolutely nothing! Finally, the play control is painfully awful. This is a game that should never have come to the PSP, since it's completely vital to use either two analog sticks or a keyboard and mouse.Don't waste your time and money on this, whether it's just the game or the PSP bundle. This stinks."
4,A good buy,"Although this game lacks a story or campaign, I found myself having a lot of fun with it. The controls take some getting used, but when you do, the game is a blast! However, if you are not a star wars fan, then I would not recomend this game because of the lack of story and and campaign. But the best way to find out is to try it yourself!"
3,disappointing,"its a good game, but its nothing like the ps2 version. first of all theres no online multiplayer, thats the only reason i got it. and also it is missing alot of the levels from the original version. finally the layout of the psp makes it awkward and difficult to aim."
4,Loverboy Still Rockin!,"It was nice to finally see a live release from Loverboy. If you are a fan of the band and have ever seen them live during their hey-day, then this CD is an absolute must have! The CD includes material from their first 4 releasess and really captures Loverboy at their best. For the most part, the mix is great and the band really rocks most of the old favorites. Strangely enough, they ommited a live versions of Notorious & It's Your Life, but included ""Lead A Double Life"". Anyone who saw the band during their 1983 tour probably remembers the voice synth in Queen Of The Broken Hearts, but it is missing from this version, though the song still rocks. Also included is a very nice tribute to Scott Smith, the bands bassist whom died recently. If you are a Loverboy fan, then buy the CD, crank it up and enjoy the music just as you did when you first heard these songs, you won't be dissapointed."
5,Underrated,"Loverboy was definitely underrated. The true test of an artist is how well they do live, as well as in the studio. Loverboy exceeds expectations in all areas."
2,Not Really Live,"This is obviously not really a lve album. The vocals were overdubbed, and probably everything else. The audience cheers at all the wrong times. Come on, guys."
3,Doesn't look anything like the picture,"I just purchased this fan, It does not say Atlantic Breeze nor has white fan blades.This is the same fan you can get cheaper but if you do factor in S&H; it comes out to be the same price due to super saver shipping.This fan was easy to put together and has solid metal clips and I was impressed by how quiet he fan was and decent output.The negatives other then not looking like the picture is too much flimsy, thin plastic in the base and the fan blades. The cage however is thicker metal."
4,Satisfied so far.,Fan is quiet and easy to assemble. It works fine. It's a tad chintsy though. No other gripes so far.
5,Quiet Fan,"If you are wanting this fan for noise at night to help you sleep, forget it. It is very quiet. It is great for having in a family area, because it IS so quiet. Has nice air flow, too."
1,Waste of money,"After assembling this fan and turning it on, I was disappointed to find that the motor does not maintain a constant speed on any setting. It constantly revs up and down and does not put out much air. Also, the tower part is a different color (gray) than the rest of the fan (white). Seems like it was a combination of two different fans, maybe more. Totally useless and a waste of money."
1,Malfunction,Pushed button #3 which is high and the fan would turn off. Nothing to make your day like assembling a product and then it doesn't work.
4,Good buy,Meets my expectation for a fan - cool and quiet.Should have warranted 5 stars had one of its handles not been broken already when arrived.
5,Cool breeze,"The Atlantic Breeze fan puts out steady air that won't blow sheets of paper around your room, but that will noticeably cool the air around you. It's a good fan. I wouldn't go through a summer without it. It seems to generate cool air somehow and then to move that air forward. It also rotates. Set at level 1 in power, the fan is extremely quiet and effective. Level 3 is much cooler and significantly louder. This says desk fan, but I have it on the floor because it is large. Recommended."
5,great fan,This is a good fan. I was so glad to be able to buy it off-season. This is also a good price. It was delivered amazingly fast too. It is surprisingly effective for circulating air when it is only 12 inches in diameter. We are glad we purchased it.
3,Pretty but could be better,"Would like to see it move a little more air on the low setting. Medium and High are just too noisy. It has a slight vibration noise that comes and goes even on low, it is not coming from the fan shroud but somewhere around the motor casing, but it is not very loud. It is a nice looking fan. The instructions were not very helpful, but it was easy to figure out."
2,"If you don't expect too much, this fan might deliver","If you want a fan that on the highest setting will give you a very subtle breeze in a small room, such as a closet, then, this device will probably suffice.It has three speeds. Why they even bother with the first two is beyond me. I guess low and medium would work well if you were trying to do a scientific experiment where you were trying to get a feather to dance in place.Do not get this item if you want to stand next to the fan and get cooled off on a hot day. It won't happen.You literally have to get within one inch of the fan housing to get anything that can even remotely be called relief on a hot day.As far as the construction is concerned, I know that, as a kid, I discovered toy surprises in Cracker Jack boxes that were made of thicker plastic than the base of this fan.It's cheaply constructed, it has virtually no power and, if you want to get cooled off on a hot night, you might throw it in the trash like I just did."
1,The movie was the Immortal Sin,"I purchased Immortal Sins after an Amazon search for all films featuring Shari Shattuck. The list was short, but I find her to be exotically attractive and inclined to play seductive roles. Whether she is or is not wearing clothes, this typecasting is perfect.Unfortunately, this film did not even approach the 2 star rating which probably marked the zenith of Shari's film career (On Deadly Ground with Steven Segal). The plot was probably written by a six-year old with a crayon, and could have been edited into a film of about 10 minutes in length without losing anything. Further, the film was shot in what I unimaginatively refer to as dark-o-vision. If there was anything of interest to see it was probably so dark in the film you wouldn't have or couldn't have seen it anyway. Regardless of whether you are a Maryam d'Abo, Cliff De Young or Shari Shattuck fan, save your money."
5,A masterpiece of New Criticism,"Bruce Haywood's analysis of Novalis' imagery was the first doctoral dissertation to be published by the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University. It is in effect a primer of the interpretation of poetic imagery and symbolism, precisely defining the differences between the two, and analyzing brilliantly and convincingly the evolution of complex poetic expression in Novalis' major works. This book is, in Milton's famous aphorism, the lifeblood of a master spirit, and more than half a century after publication it continues to enlighten students pondering how to analyze an assigned poem. Too, as all good books do, it enlarges the reader's vocabulary in the process."
5,Wilson Ump-Catcher Mask,"Excellent product. High quality construction, nice finish and a good fit (I have a 7 5/8 hat size). Pads are comfortable. Good viewing range. Excellent mid priced mask."
4,Great catchers mask,"This is an excellent catchers mask for the money. It is a little heavy, But does the job well. I would purchase again."
5,Amazing!,"As soon as I took the mask out of the package I put it on and it was SO comfortable. The only thing that is different in the picture is the padding color. The whole mask is black. The MLB logo is on the back of the straps (If it matters to you). The straps are adjustable sliders. Great mask, and comfortable."
1,Sleazy Caper,"About the only thing going for it was the setting, and the story line was ok. That's what drew me in the first place to pick it up, but...yuk.. The main characters had a totally one-track mind: sex and more sex. Trashy. Randy robots. No real brains. No romance. Mindless sexual musings. The worst ""graphic novel"" ever written. Don't waste your money, esp. the teens who undoubtedly will be drawn to the sexy-cute cover: wht's in between the covers is NOT for sweet sixteen!! Watchers of Sex and the City would blush...or throw up."
1,Just Plain Awful!!,"Cutting to the chase--the sex scenes were robotic at best. The characters were dull: the hero, a video game creator, rode around Wisconsin in a white pick-up truck, the heroine, a comic book store owner...There is absolutely, ZERO foreplay in the sex scenes. It is just really odd. Wait maybe there was a kiss once...This book is not worth a dime!Susan's older stuff is much, much, much better.It's sad but I think she's lost her steam:("
2,*NOT SUSAN'S BEST*,"I love Susan Johnson books! I buy everything she writes! Hot Spot was contemporary NOT historical, which I prefer. Quick read, light, entertaining. Some good sex. Hope this helps."
2,Disappointed.,This was not what I expected it to be. The plastic was so cheap and flimsy. I purchased two because I had to cover a long distance. It did well as far as the flow of air after I had to tape the two together and tape it to the floor so that I would not move all over the place. It needs to be sturdier to be impressive.
4,good purchase,"After looking high and low for a similar product in my area, I was forced to locate this item onlne. I read the negative feedback and felt leery about purchasing it. However, I am very glad I went through with it! I think the reason why it is made with ""flimsy"" plastic is so that it will not break if it is stepped on. It was used to reroute the air flow from under my bed. For years, I was forced to have my bed in the middle of my bedroom, now that I have the vent extender I have so much more space since the bed is now against a wall! It does exactly what it's advertised to do. My husband installed this product with duct tape to prevent it from being displaced when the heat kicked on and it works like a charm."
1,It's cheap but it's about what I expected for the money,"Many reviewers comment on how cheap the plastic is. That is not an issue for me since all it needs to do is redirect airflow, and a sturdier, more brittle plastic will snap if stepped on, this platic won't. My issue with this is it states that it clips on to the vent. It does not, as other reviewers commented. I used a little clear shipping tape, but I didn't feel I should have since it is clearly dishonest advertising. Without some way to attach this to the vent, when the heat or A/C comes on, this vent extender just goes floating away across the floor."
3,"Not sure how it ""clips"" on","I purchased this to put over the register that is under a cabinet. It does work to direct the airflow to the edge of the furniture, so that's good. It is a light plastic, but it is certainly thick enough for the type of item. I don't think I'd want it exposed, but then again the smaller ones that we're all used to also get kicked and broken, so I don't think this one is any worse in that department. My major beef is how is it supposed to clip to the register? It comes with nothing that would clip it down. You can get around this as other reviewers have suggested, but when the description says it clips, I want to be able to clip it. I wouldn't recommend it for any area where it will be exposed to feet (human or pet), but under a piece of low furniture it seems to be perfectly fine."
3,The Truth,"the product worked as promised. Wasn't to concerned with how cheap the plastic was as others stated, because its under my couch, no where visible. The only problem i had with it is it had no magnets that most duct deflectors have to hold it onto the register. But i had a small brick that i placed on top of it and it is working fine. Other than the lack of magnets, this product works perfectly."
2,Better off making something yourself,"As a few others have mentioned, this is made with incredibly cheap, thin plastic. It is thinner and more flexible than most plastic packaging material. The picture I saw shows white plastic, but it is actually clear. Given that it is so light/flexible/flimsy, the air from my vent blows it out of position. I'll have to find something to set on top of it like other people have (the problem is that I'm not sure how much clearance I'll have under the furniture). It would definitely be nice to have something a little more rigid. I'm sure you could make a better product yourself and not spend any more money..."
5,Another good one,"There is some similarity to the set-up of the author's excellent previous novel, ""Hadrian's Wall."" But ""Scourge of God"" has a broader sweep, convincingly contrasting life in Constantinople with Attila and the Huns before the main character goes on to the Western Roman Empire. The dilemmas faced by the Romans of the mid fifth century, both east and west, are very well brought out. But this book is far more than just an interesting, and well-researched, history lesson as it skillfully threads a gripping storyline around a series of pivotal historical events. I found it very hard to put down and, if anything I would rate it slightly above ""Hadrian's Wall."" I certainly hope the author will give us more from this era."
4,Just get past the first 150 pages...,"So this book was recommended to me by a little old lady in a small independent book store. I bought it because she was really nice and the store needed the business. So the book starts off really slow. It took about 154 pages until something interesting happened. Granted the author needed to set up the storyline, but it would have been nice to have some action happen during the set up. After the story got going it did get better and I enjoyed it. If you can get past the first 150 pages then I think you'll enjoy this book, especially if you like history. If you follow Roman history then you'll really love this book."
4,Family Matters,"This movie is wonderfully scripted and acted and illustrates perfectly the importance of family, regardless the makeup of that family. It teaches many lessons about unconditional love and commitment, following your heart and what happens when you succumb to the pressures of the world. There are enough twists to hold your interest, and enough personal flaws to make each character believable. Treat yourself to a good story with a great message."
3,Jumbled but a moving film,"First off thos movie had an excellent cast with a hard job of connecting the people in this movie. It took me a while to know how and why the people were connected. It was a moving story of the family of Caramel Boxer. Her life, love, and hurt were presented in a sad, but tasteful fashion. I want to give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars because it was emotional, driven, and beautifully written, but the scenes were jumbled and not inspiring. I will have to watch it again, because I see that the director wanted the movie to be like a constellation. You may only see one star (person), but they are apart of the whole constellation (family). The quotes from this movie were amazing. I am going to add them to my facebook page. Be patient with this movie and you will not regret it.I would very much like to have had a soundtrack to this movie. The songs were moving and excellent."
1,Choose Another Constellation.,"I am from Huntsville, Alabama, and like most Huntsville residents I find this community an exceptional place to live, work, and raise a family. I can only sense that the writers, editors, and directors of this film feel the same way. Which is why they produced this film? The actors each gave good performances. But the script was poor, the direction was rushed, and the film editing was, well..., bad. This film was painful to watch, and I can only recommend watching to those who may find it interesting to see the more recognizable places in Huntsville. That was enjoyable."
1,Total Disappointment...not worth watching,"At first glance given the cast line up, I thought Constellation would be a great movie. However, The characters and the set were the only good parts of this film. As for the storyline, it is totally all over the place. Whoever wrote this movie seemingly had a bunch of ideas and just threw them into one movie with no order or smooth transition from one scene to the next. The movie jumps around too much and you have no idea why this scene is following that scene. Totally unorganized and poorly written and directed. The storyline is difficult to follow from all the inconsistencies in the plot, and I never really saw a love story develop like the cover described. I just got it as a rental and I want my money back!"
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","I was under the impression that this was going to be a good movie. But boy was I wrong. The story was all over the place and it takes 30 mins to figure who's who in the movie. Movie doesn't really do a good job of laying down the foundation of the movie. I thought the movie was more about the main character but it was really about the main character's brother and his family. Rent Kingdom Come, it's pretty much the same thing but a little bit better."
2,Where is it,"Its been over two months since I placed this order. Tracking information is not available, so I have no idea where my movies are. Once they arrive, I may submit a higher review."
1,Don't waste your money,Another film with alot of hype. I wish I could get my money back for this one too. Script was missing something. Acting was alright.
2,I Had High Hopes For This Movie,"I was going to buy this off of Amazon but something told me to rent it first and I'm glad I did. This could have been a real good movie with a better script. The acting was superb; I was so excited to see Rae Dawn Chong, but other than that I was so NOT impressed with this movie. I'd have to watch it twice to really figure out was going on because the story is so all over the place you just really have no idea whats going on. Only thing is, it's so boring I couldn't even bother to watch it again. Honestly, I was quite angry by the time the movie ended. I'm not going to discourage anyone from buying this, but I will encourage you to rent before you buy. And if you're still intent on buying then please watch the movie and try not to be distracted by other things because it deserves attention.....ugh!!This movie is certainly being removed from my shopping cart."
4,Arling & Cameron - We Are A&C,"Arling & Cameron excel at putting the ""pop"" into electro-pop, and their 2nd album, _We Are A&C_ displays this perfectly. The album starts out ridiculously peppy, from the strings and horns that sing out halfway through ""5th Dimension"" to the acid and scratching of ""B. B. Electro,"" there's an undeniable current of fun here. They're not afraid of mocking themselves in the title track--""Two fruits from a musical tree."" Sure, if you say so. The funky tropicalia of ""Coconut Conga"" gives a sly nod to Senor Coconut's own digital reinterpretations, and ""Can You Pah-Pah?"" is deliriously perky. ""Born in June"" takes the tempo down several notches to a soft R&B vibe, while ""Love & Understanding"" swoons with cheeky romance. If Italian jazz is more your thing, then jump to ""Ocean Drive,"" a cruise down the Malfi coast, and ""Sunday"" is just as warm and sunny. The Delta blues of ""Multiplications Blues"" or the punk attitude of ""Don't You F**k"" show a whole new side to A&C."
5,Great taste.,"First found out about these chews in a coffee shop. Was so glad to be able to find out I could purchase them through Amazon. Have a great flavor. The only problem is that the chew is hard to remove from the wrapper. It sticks to it. Do, however, recommend it."
5,Fun book.,"I enjoyed this book. There are mixed reviews on it, it can be a little slow at times but I really do enjoy the characters and the basic premise of the book. Its worth a read."
5,Tahitian Music,This group is so amazing and creative. I ordered the CD via Amazon and it arrived perfectly within about 5 days.I am so glad to have this CD!
3,Remake of their previous CD;s,"I bought this CD because I have two other Fenua CD's and I love them. But, I am disappointed with this one (Hymnes de Tahiti). Most of the songs or music are a remake of their older CD's. The second one was the best. I believe it was Fenua the Voyage."
1,Nice specs... thats all they are,"AVOID AVOID AVOID BUFFALO> I have the 500GB version of this Linkstation. I would agree will Bill, although mine hasn't failed yet(had it for a month). Constantly grinds. Slow as molasses for everything, DLNA non compliant, 500GB of tortoise storage, 50 db of constant noise. Without getting into all the details, DLNA basically is non functional on this. Even if it did work, why in the world would the drive need to spin constantly just to remain available on the network?Support has blown me off 2 times, although they seem quite aware of the problem, but developement and management let them blow in the wind. First and last Buffalo product I guess. Unless Buffalo has some other product that actually works and will trade me, I guess I got another new paperweight. Arg."
1,Waste of Money,"Never could get this thing to work reliably. Took up space for a while in my PC tower area, then flipped it to the trash. Don't bother to buy this unit."
4,Reccomended Product,"The product is well serving. A lot of functionality for a small business and a cost effective way of managing certain IT needs without overspending. Beginners need not purchase. Intermediate skills needed to operate but still user friendly if you are not advanced. So far, no problems."
1,so good,"me gusto mucho la compu, ahorita estoy enviando el mail desde ella. es muy buenaaaaaaaaaaaa.. jejeje"
5,Incr&#65533;vel!,"O VAIO VGN-FJ270P/B 14"" ? perfeito! ? extremamente leve e r?pido. Apesar de ter somente 14"" e ser bastante compacto, d? a impress?o de que as imagens s?o enormes. E, mesmo n?o sendo denterminante para a compra, a c?mera na parte superior da tela deixa o laptop ainda mais charmoso.Altamente recomend?vel."
2,DON'T buy for the Speakerphone,"I recently switched everyone in my office to Skype for phone lines. We needed a good speakerphone for conference calls. In the past I have used Polycom Skype speakerphones, with good luck, but my new laptop seems to have a dead microphone port. Result? Had to switch to a USB speakerphone. This seemed like a good deal, good price, so away my One-Click went.The speakerphone is terrible. Good volume, but the callers cannot hear you unless you move directly over the phone. The vaunted Skype integration via software is a pain: non-intuitive, and requires working the phone and the PC at the same time. Finally, if you want to use a headset AND this phone, forget it: while you can reconfigure the software to stop sending calls to the phone, it still insists on ringing the phone and lagging hangups.I'm heading to return this one."
2,Not for professional use,"just tried the skytone and he polycom communicator side by side. (spoiler: the polycom is MUCH better).the only thing that works kind of ok is when the skytone is used with skype. even then most buttons on the phone don't work right (and the manual does not even explain what most are actually for, like SEND). vol+ and vol-? no effect! the sound quality is 3 stars out of 5. what bothered me the most is that the big green speakerphone button does not switch the speakerphone on in any other application other than skype. so even though the device gets a brownie point for functioning as a sound card with those pc's that dont have one, you can hear system sounds/audio only through the handset... go figure...in summary, its only $40 bucks, but it does not really work as good as it should. if you only plan to use it with skype you might be satisfied."
1,"DOES NOT Integrate well with skype, messes your PC Audio Controls","Though cheap, this phone does not integrate well with skype, some of the buttons on the phone like the 'in', 'out', and 'del' do not have any or the wrong effect on skype software. Also the drivers messed up my laptop's audio quickset controls, which did not happen with my cyberphone W which I got from the skype website"
2,can't seem to get calls IN???,"Phone seems ok, but a bit difficult to figure out how to enable it for use. You don't just pick it up and dial! I just got it, but can't seem to figure out how to pick up a call, without hanging up on it.Also, as others have stated........ it seems like it should be able to read the skype contact list and transfer it enabled to dial capacity. but even though the skype contact list says ""+"" and ""1"" before each number, the phone will not register it to dial it that way. Therefor you have the number in the directory on your computer- but you have to enter the codes and the # manually for calls out using the phone. You can't even hit ""call"" on the computer.......... the call won't go through. you can only use the list to access what the number is.Not too satisfied with this product yet."
2,You get what you pay for,"Very easy to set up. Could be described as 'plug and play'. That is the only good thing about it. The quality of the reception is appauling and people on the other end kept complaining, so we've stopped using it. It is destined for the scrapheap of dead phones. I have another skype phone, the lynsys cordless which I paid over double for and the quality is pretty good."
2,Def NOT hi-def,"I purchased this based on reviews here saying that the screen resolution was good. I have been very disappointed. The picture quality is horrible, menu's are almost unreadable. I'd rather watch movies on my Samsung DVD-L25 with a 2.5"" screen than this larger 3.5"" screen. Battery life seems good, but with the battery on, it doesn't even fit in the case it comes with. I wouldn't recomend this product to anyone."
2,If You Plan to Use This DVD Player in an Airplane....,"Or ANYWHERE that there is a lot of noise, the VOLUME just does not go high enough!! I loved this player until I tried to fly with it (and I was in first class!) and just finally gave up trying to watch a movie on it.I found the screen to be good and sharp and the colors were quite brilliant. I had no problem with the size of the screen.I use it when I am on the treadmill at the gym and with the volume turned up as high as possible, I am still able to hear the movies pretty much. The only problem is that occasionally when it is in my gym bag and in its own case, the ""on"" switch will be pushed by something in my bag and the battery will need to be recharged so they could work on making the switch a little more resistant.I plan on purchasing earphones that block out a lot of environmental noise and hopefully it will allow me to use this DVD player at airports."
3,Nice features However,"I have had this product only 1 month. The features were why I purchased this item & I have not been disappointed with that. However, multiple segments on the function display did not illuminate. This was a gift for my son & the hassle of repackaging, returning to vendor, waiting for a replacement made an exchange non-desirable. In this case, buying the product from a store rather than over the net would be my recommendation."
3,Nice option for personal use,"As some have noted, this little DVD player has barely enough sound level to be heard comfortably through headphones in a quiet room. There is no built-in speaker. On an airplane, you cannot hear the audio at all over the roar of the engines. I used sound-cancelling headphones and was barely able to hear much of the dialogue. 18 mw is terribly insufficient.While screen resolution is low, it is adequate for most movies. This is not a newly produced device; it has older screen technology. It works well enough.Overall performance is very good. I was able to watch a complete movie during each of two flights, recharging the unit between flights. I did notice, however, that while there are adjustments for brightness, color and contrast, there is no TINT adjustment. I did find the colors to be a bit towards the blue, and no way to adjust it."
1,do not buy this,"This product played only 50% of the DVDs I tried to play - all of the DVDs were brand new, sealed in the box, commercially produced DVDs of recently released movies or tv shows. For those DVDs that it did play, I found it slow to load and the resolution is TERRIBLE."
5,Wonderful singing! In tradition of Nusrat...,"I picked this up by mistake actually, thinking it was a younger Nusrat recording.When I got home and saw it was his ""successor"" and that the album was produced by Rick Rubin, I was dubious.The first seconds of the first track took away these apprehensions, though. Rahat has a beautiful voice, and all tracks are in the traditional style, not bastardized for a Western audience.It's not really fair to try to compare Rahat to Nusrat, is it? Rahat has a strong and unique voice in his own right, and I enjoy this CD very much. I just wish there was more of his music available."
5,Pleasure Pleasure Pleasure,"Rahat has a voice only a successor of Nusrat can have. His voice is completely different from Nusrat yet he can create that magic that only the best qawwals can create - the feeling of ""wajd"" or ecstasy.Buy him, its worth every cent!"
4,Rahat can sing!,"I saw Rahat Khan in Chicago at one of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's final shows. Nusrat was very, very late arriving, and Rahat took centerstage (with a rendition of Mera Piya Gar Aya) to placate the audience which had started to hiss and boo. And what a turnaround. He won rapturous applause for an electrifying performance. Only 17 at the time, Rahat stole the rest of show too, outsinging the others (even the ailing Nusrat) with his soloes. It was clear that he would be the one who would claim Nusrat's mantle. It is good to finally see a solo release by Rahat, though the lack of sound clips here makes a buying decision difficult. The one track I've heard (Khaban Wich Meray Toon Na Aa) was great and indicates that this release is in the traditional (rather than fusion) vein."
3,Expected better from EA,"This game isn't bad, but it's nowhere near as good as the version for the PC. The graphics are nice, but the gameplay isn't that great. Navigating through the pre-game menus is an incredible chore. This is one of the first games I bought for the N64 and I was disappointed. If you have a PC with a gamepad, buy the PC version."
4,"works for iPods, but didn't work for my iPod Touch","Got the merchandise no problem from the vendor and price is unbeatable. HOWEVER, it doesn't work for my iPod Touch (it said ""unauthorized"" or something like that)."
1,4th Generation iPod owners...stay away!,"When I plugged this charger into my wife's new 4th Generation iPod Nano, the iPod told me that this charger is not compatible........woulda been nice if Amazon hadn't promoted this as a go-with item when I purchased the iPod."
3,"Ok, but melted after a year",For the money it's good. But about a year after I bought it for my iPod 5G it made a pop sound and stopped working. It looked like it had melted plastic.
3,good,"I have used this charger about 8 times on my nano (3rd gen) and it seems to be working fine. A downside is that it can take more than 6 hrs to fully charge when you have little battery left on the ipod. UPDATE: my brand-new ipod started crashing and freezing not long after I got it and I hold these malfunctions to be this charger's fault. My ipod has even 'blacked-out' for days after using this charger. My ipod is fine if I use my apple charger (computer one), but it freaks out after using this one, probably because this charger has no way of stopping the charging process w/o unplugging the whole thing from the outlet. This sudden disconnect probably is a cause of my ipod's various issues. In conclusion, the ruin of my ipod stemmed from this charger and the abrupt disconnect problems sure didn't help any. I would not recommend this charger to anyone."
2,"Seems sturdy, but does NOT work on my iPhone","It clearly stated on the product details that this charger works with iPhone. Unfortunately, I plugged it in and that oh so friendly message came up saying that the accessory was not compatible. Here's the thing though, someone else's iphone worked on the charger (his is older purchased in December), but mine is new and had the message pop up instantly. This happened with my other iPod related accessories that I had for my old nano and iPod...they just don't work on the iPhone. PLEASE BEWARE...it says one thing on the website, but I can attest to the fact that it is not iPhone friendly on the new phones."
5,handy little gadget,"Ok, I purchased this for 99 cents and was doubtful, but hoping it would work. It worked perfectly and charged my iPod nano in a short amount of time, i don't know how long exactly. This is the perfect thing to carry along for any type of trips or vacations. Or you can use it if you don't have a dock and the computer's too slow."
4,"Works well enough, nothing special","This iPod charger is just that--it charges the iPod in about two hours, almost the same as if you'd plugged it into your computer, only without the hassle that almost always comes with that option. It's cheap, and gets the job done.My only complaint is that the cord is a bit too short--it's just enough to reach up to the top of a 28-inch high desk, with no wiggle room. Other than that, though, it works fine. Can't beat the price either."
4,iPOD charger,The first time the shipment was lost in mail; the sender sent it again. I got it a week later. Except for this issue i'm satisfied with the transaction. The product works absolutely fine.
4,Its good...,"CTA Travel charger for iPod is real cool. As it is 40$ with Apple, I was looking for a cheaper, quality stuff...and this travel charger proves to be one...I am happy!"
3,Works great with my iPod nano!,"I bought this to charge myApple iPod nanoand it works great. I much prefer to charge it with this, rather than plug it into my computer - since most of the time I don't need to synch anything.I haven't had any problems - and at this price it's a pretty great deal. It doesn't work with my son'sApple iPod touch, but it does exactly what I want with my own device."
4,"Good Price, Good product",Cheap and fast delivery of this iPod after merket charger.. I works fine and I saved some money.. The only thin i dont like is the red lite that is on whenever its plugged in..
1,Broke in Less than 1 Month,"Charged the ipod 1 time, then broke. I'm just glad it didn't hurt the ipod."
3,Charger doesn't work for all ipods,"I purchased this charger to go with an Ipod nano 4th generation. It seemed to me to indicate it would work from the description, but it did not. It plugs into the ipod, but an error message appears on the screen saying something about it being incompatible. I have an older version of a regular ipod (30g memory, no video), and it does work with that. I've just kept it as an additional charger in case I lose mine or want to leave this one at work, etc."
1,This charger destroyed my Ipod,"After reading numerous reviews on this charger, I decided to give it a try. After the second time using it to charge My recently purchased, refurbished Ipod Click wheel, 3rd gen, I received an Error message. I called Apple and and based on the error message they determined the battery was not accepting a charge. The first thing they asked me after determining it was the battery, was, what kind of charger was I using. They told me that these chargers are known to damage the charging circuitry on the Ipod. After being repaired by Apple, and purchasing a brand name charger, I havc had no further problems."
1,iPod touch - NOT compatible with 3rd and 4th gen,"Tried to charge my daughter's iPod touch. After plugging it in, the touch displayed, ""charging is not supported with this accessory."" Check the cta site to be certain (or least slightly more so) that this is compatible with your specific device. It is only compatible with 1st and 2nd gen touches. [...]"
2,Disappointed - won't work with iPhone 3G,Does not work with my iPhone 3G. An error message displays on the phone saying that the device is not compatible. It does however charge my iPod 120GB. Oh well. Cheap product. You get what you pay for.
1,does not charge ipod nano !!!,"not happy.with product,. state in front of package for (ALL) ipod and iphone charger, did not work with my ipod nano."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this for my iPod touch, and like may other people, I received the error message, ""Charging not supported with this accessory."""
5,Excellent for a charger back-up,"Unless I'm downloading new music to my iPod video, I prefer to recharge it using this. It's fast and dependable and it's $28 cheaper than an Apple charger, with both doing exactly the same thing. Also there's an effective lock on the plug insert that keeps in firmly in place as it's charging your unit. Recommended as an excellent value."
1,BUYER BEWARE - Product will KILL IPOD Video 30G,"If you own an IPOD Video 30G, stay away from this product. I tried charging my IPOD with this charger and it completely FROZE the screen and the IPOD could no longer be used. I had to return the IPOD to amazon to get a replacement. What a hassle!!!!! Do not buy this CHEAP product and invest in the APPLE Charger. There must be a reason why this charger is being sold for under $2... GO FIGURE!"
5,Easier to use,"This item makes it easier to charge my ipod, i don't have to have my computer on and better tp travel with."
5,Works Fine,This product charges my iPod mini just like the Apple brand charger except about 20-30 bucks cheaper.
1,Don't bother,I took a chance and bought this. It came quickly but only lasted 3 days and then gave out. If you want to buy a charger then go with Belkin or another reliable model. This one didn't make the grade. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Great for old iPods,"This is the second one I have bought. The first one was stolen by my old roommate. He has used it on 2nd generation iPod nano and I have 1st generation iPod nano. Great thing to have if you don't want to use the USB port on your computer and did I mention great price, too!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I was excited to see a cheap alternative to an Apple branded product and decided to take a chance. My workday exceeds my ipod's battery life so I need a way to charge it during the day. I plugged it in at lunch time and the LED on the charger lit up, and the battery indicator on my ipod showed that it was charging. Then, within 30 seconds, it stopped working. The LED on the plug is the only thing that works. I paid $.01 for this, then nearly $3.00 for shipping! Never again! I should have read reviews before making this purchase seeing that it has destroyed some people's ipods! I guess that I was lucky to have only wasted a little bit of money. If it were possible to give a rating of less than 1 star, I would, I can't stand to get ripped off."
1,Does not charge iPhone 3G,"I took a chance and ordered this item hoping for an inexpensive additional charger for my new iPhone 3G. Unfortunately, when I attached it to the iPhone a message came up on the screen that said ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"" and ""This accessory is not made to work with iPhone"".Oh well...Lesson learned. Pay a little extra and get an item that actually works."
1,Will not work with ipod Touch,"I tried to use this charger and it says.""Charging is not supported with this accessory"""
1,You definitely get what you paid for.,My iPod charger did not work out of the box. So I put it aside and siimply used the USB cable that came with the iPod to charge with. Later when I inspected the iPod charger to get it working I found it was burnt out and simply covered up again for resale. Don't buy your recharger from this vendor.
5,No longer have to use the computer to charge my iPod,"Great product - and means that I can recharge my iPod any place. Before because I have one of the older models, I was always plugging it in to my laptop - and I don't always have my laptop with me when I travel - this is a great convenience and was the best price of all of the places I checked out before ordering this one from Amazon.com."
2,"Sort of works, but not what you want","I have a Nano and a 3rd gen Touch. This charger does charge both of them, but it doesn't charge them all the way, they both stopped before they were fully charged. Even after unplugging then replugging back in, they won't charge fully. The charger also makes a very quiet buzzing sound and I swear it has a funny smell when it's charging as though the charging rate is incorrect. I ended up returning this and paying for the overpriced Apple charger."
3,Not supported by iPod Touch 3G,"The quality is fine, and the product is lightweight. However, when I plugged into the third Generation iPod touch I bought it with the following message appeared on my screen: ""Charging is not supported with this accessory."" A quick search online revealed that Apple changed their charging specifications for third generation iPod touch, rendering older charging accessories useless. However, it does work with first and second generation iPod Touches. Caveat Emptor."
1,Cheap Junk,"I plugged my ipod touch in using this charger and the screen started jumping and going crazy. I unplugged it and threw the charger away. I don't think there is any permanent damage but I would not try this one. Just in case you think I am an apple shill, I have an after market car charger that was bought on amazon that works fine."
4,You get what you see,"Fast shipping. The product is exactly as described. Works just fine too. It has a simple design and is not fancy, but price pays off. Definitely recommend."
1,Very poor product,"This charger was supposed to work with 4th generation ipod nano. When I plugged my new nano into the charger, I got a message saying something to the effect of ""device not supported."" Also, the first time I pulled the charger out of the electrical outlet, it all fell apart. I threw it away. My advice is--do not waste your money. I had to give it one star in my review--no stars was not a choice."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought 2 of these chargers, one for me and one for my brother-in-law. His stopped working 2 weeks later, mine 2 month later (yes, it ""just"" stopped working one day). Based on my own experience I'll say that this charger will stop working 2-8 weeks after your purchase. You'll decide if that's acceptable and if you're willing to take the chance. I believe Apple's charger it's too expensive, and this cheap one just doesn't work (at least for me). I guess the best thing I can do is just keep charging my iPod through the USB port. Thanks!"
5,Works great,"This really came in handy on a recent trip to Vegas and southern Utah as I don't own a laptop. Get it, it really works."
5,Inexpensive and Effective,"This charger is fantastic! It's hard to believe it is so inexpensive. My ipod charges up in about an hour or two, which is a lot faster than when I plug it into the hard drive."
3,Its good enough...,"I like the charger. Its just difficult to tell when it is fully charged. But, it was super cheap and does the job."
4,it works ok,"it works ok however, the appearence of the charger is not so appealing...also, be aware that the price changes every day!i bought it for 1.40 and then the price was one cent.. then 30 cents then 70 cents thats the price right now.. sowatch when it is one cent jaja"
1,Warning: NOT COMPATIBLE W/ iPhone 3G,"As my subject says, this product will not charge your iPhone 3G. Don't even try!"
1,Waste of Money,"I've bought these aftermarket chargers before and never had an issue. My son vacuumed up the cord on our iPod charger - tearing it to shreds and I thought this looked like a reasonable replacement.Wrong.It doesn't charge any of our iPods: 2nd gen. Touch, lastest generation Touch or 5th gen. nano. Says they're incompatible.Not really worth returning so I threw it away."
1,Never Received,"This item was never received. Out of frustration, I let it go considering it would probably not be worth the aggervation it would cause to try to straighten it out."
1,Does not work,"I have an iPod 3G and an iPod 4G. When I plug this charger into either one the screen displays ""charging is not supported with this accessory""."
1,Doesn't work for iPods,"We bought this for our daughter in Bolivia. It didn't work on her iPod nano. So she sent it back to us with a friend. I tried on my iPod Touch, and it didn't work on that either-- ""device not supported"" error. Not recommended."
1,waste of money,"When I plugged this in to my iPod Nano, a message appeared on the screen that said, ""Charging is not supported with this accessory."" I tried it with another Nano and with an iPod Touch as well and same thing happened in each case. There are cheap, generic chargers out there that work but this isn't one of them."
1,DO NOT BUY,This is the second CTA device I bought... should have learned my lesson from the last time.First time it stopped working after 1 week. CTA had me contact the seller and the seller ignored my emails. Ended up buying an Insten brand and it's working great with a used ipod I bought to replace the one damaged by this device.
3,CORD Length - Too short,"Because of short cord length on this charger we have to plug it into the wall and place the IPOD on the floor. The cord is 3'8"" which is not long enough to even reach an end table that is only 4 inches over from the wall outlet. It also prevents us from being able to plug it into the power cord under our home office desk and using the IPOD at the same time...same reason, cord is just not long enough. It will not reach from the floor powerstrip outlet (located just in front of our feet under the desk) to our hands - even when sitting down at the desk.If the manufacter is reading this....we would gladly pay and extra dollar to have a decent cord length to work with. Most people obviously need to be able to use their electronics at the same time they are being charged. [The product does its job of charging the device.] We feel expensive electronics should not have to be dropped onto the floor, and possibly stepped on, in order to be charged."
5,Just what I'd been searching for,"I've been looking for months for a power solution for my video ipod that wasn't going to cost me a lot of money..I wanted to be able to use my ipod at work, all day long, without it running out of juice. I could only get about 4 hours of video before the battery drained. This unit is perfect for charging AND watching/listening at the same time. Most usb connections bring up the ""Do Not Disconnect"" screen on the ipod, so it was great to see that that does not happen with this charger.Possibly the best five dollars I've spent in a long, long time."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"You get what you pay for with this product, because you can usually find it for less than $3 (not including shipping).When I try to charge my ipod, sometimes it alternates between charging and not charging every 5 seconds or so, so my ipod cannot charge. Don't waste your money on this - find something better."
1,TERRIBLE CHARGER,"Can it even be called a charger if it doesnt charge??? I bought this a few weeks ago and have tried several times to use it on my IPOD touch... and it doesnt work. When my IPOD is on the home page it shows on the battery that it is plugged in, but it doesnt charge. I paid more in shipping than I did for the product, so I am not sending it back... I just threw it away."
3,This is simply a REFERENCE book.,"I was greatly disappointed - I homeschool and expected it to be a work/textbook - neither one. It is just a reference book, and quite simplistic - max of about 3rd grade level."
2,lavender room spray,It's lovely and natural smelling when it comes out of the can but it does not linger so it's not good for room freshening.
2,Okay but Grossly Overpriced!,Yes it smells allright but the price is cost prohibitive so I would recommned checking other options or simply buying some lavender oil and mixing it with water in a squirt bottle
1,rip-off,"What you get is not 4 cans (as pictured), but 1.This is misleading.A similiar product can be bought elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.With shipping, you end up paying approx. $15 for one can of aerosol !"
2,Happy Palette,The speaker is monotone and repeats herself numerous times to get her point across. It was boring and contained very basic information. I expected more after reading the other reviews.
1,"Terrible, A waste of money",The sound quality is off and somewhat distorted. The instruction was the worst I've had in thirty or more videos. I feel cheated. I read the reviews and thought I was getting something worthwhile.
2,As disappointing as the movie for which it was made.,"Sad to say, and even more so to hear, but the Star Wars saga took a tumble with Episode VI, and the soundtrack was no exception. I didn't get the original LP, though I enthusiastically did so with A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Different than those two releases, it was only a single record, and to be painfully honest, it STILL doesn't need more than one disc! Much as with the movie, the music, while featuring some interesting and even fun bits (""Jedi Rocks"" is a hoot!), is largely a rehash of the themes of the previous two movies. Without any discernable fire or vitality to the effort, it comes off as a limp copy of better work, kinda like the lame re-working of William's stellar Superman soundtrack for Superman II. For the true Star Wars fan or John Williams completist (I plead guilty on both counts, Your Honor!) only."
1,Put them on the street where they belong.,"As a parent, I find these dolls too sugestive for younger children. I am by no means a conservative, but these babyz are over the line. I find dolls that dress like Fredericks of Hollywood not suitable for younger girls! If you are a parent, think before you buy these dolls."
3,nice but too big,"I just got this doll and she is great, the only problem is that you cant play with them as being the baby of the bratz. I didnt realize it but when i put her in carage and got my other bratz doll, i noticed the baby is two times the size of the bratz doll. Overall this doll is fun!"
5,My Introduction to Carmen McRae,"This album was my first introduction to the vocal talents of Carmen McRae. The music backing McRae is an absolutely glorious fusion of modern and old school jazz. The singer's phrases is so effortless. This set of music is wonderful for a truly romantic evening with your ""significant other"", two stiff high balls and candlelight."
3,Its Fast,It cooks Pizza better and faster than a normal oven; but its big. Many bars have the same unit.
5,Nifty,"I like my oven so much that I bought one for my parents.Beg to differ with the previous comment. All I do with mine is rising dough. I prebake the shells for about 5 minutes and throw them in the freezer. When it's show time, I thaw a shell, put cheese, sauce, spices, and what not on it, and in about 12 minutes I have a fresh-baked pizza. Specifically, I prebake the shells in a 12-inch pan. I do the follow-up baking on the rack. Proportions per shell, for me, are 250 grams of all-purpose flour and 150 grams of water, plus yeast and salt.Does a nice job with focaccia.Warm-up time is about 3 minutes, during which you can do your preparation. There's no thermostat; everything is controlled by a timer.In short, it's a simple, effective, easy-to-use appliance.My only other comment is it's a fairly large special purpose appliance and I have a fairly small galley kitchen."
3,Middle ground on these,"They have great sound, but then this is Sony, I wouldn't expect anything less. Problems with design. I don't use the for running, but can see this would cause problems. The ""earhook"" are very nice is you are not moving about. Easy on your ears, very comfortable. But the slightest movement dislodges them. This could have been corrected if they had made the earhook longer. As if, for exercise these are the pits. I used them hooked to my laptop to listen to my writing being reread back on ReadPlease. Even with as little movement as that take they were constantly falling off!I also didn't like the cord design. Instead of the Y shape with equal cords, that generally are adjustable. The has a very short side that goes under your chin and then the long lead comes from the one side. Nice concept, but it's the pits for something with very long hair. Feels like I have a chin strap.Sorry, cheap ones half the prices are much better."
1,"Decent headphones, horrible for running","These headphones fit comfortably, produce decent sound (nothing special) but do not stay on your ears while running - despite the fact that they are advertised as ""Sport"" headphones! I spent half of my time running holding them to my ears or catching them as they fell out.Another annoying point: the cord is the type where one ear is much longer than the other (so that you can wear the player at your hip). Some people like this but it drives me crazy and the cords constantly get tangled. I have to untangle the earbuds before every use.However, if you just want some white earphones to match your white iPod then buy these."
2,Not Intended for Use During Movement,"Stupidly, I bought these for running without readings reviews. They did fit in my ears nicely but would be ripped off with the slightest tug while jogging. Also, the plastic on the cord rubbed off exposing the wires after only two months. The plastic used to encase the wires is too soft to stand up to movement. The sound is pretty good but only buy if you plan on remaining stationary."
2,Not built to last,"I have had these headphones for several years. Like many of the other reviewers, I got them because the earbuds that you have to jam into your ear canal are not comfortable for me. They are comfortable enough, but I've been looking for a new pair of headphones because they are falling apart. I have tape holding both earphones together as the rubber coating between the wire and the ear piece has completely separated on both sides, exposing the bare wires beneath. Also, the ear hook on the left side keeps coming off, and often manages to find its way far beneath my desk at work. These were good at first, but for the price you'd think they would be of better quality."
3,Good sound - but it didn't stay in my ear,"While I like these headphones, they did not stay in my ear, and thus were not very useful for excercising, etc. The sound was good."
3,An Inspiring Vision,"In his classic simple language Jackson describes the costs of our current way of doing agriculture. He focuses on soil loss with emphasizing the fact that our dependence has gone from ""soil to oil"" for energy and fertilizer.This book outlines Jackson's idea for a perennial, herbaceous, polyculture agriculture that mimics the natural environment instead of our current annual, herbaceous, monoculture. Jackson also gives a broad view of decentralizing our societies and distributing people across land according to its ability to support them in the proper concentration.The critiques of current agricultural practices is well done but simple enough for the laymen to understand. Simple computations are used to illustrate the ecological and financial costs of capital/oil intensive agriculture.The discussion of values and religion in chapter 8, though it has a good direction, is lacking in comparison to Jackson's other topics."
5,Informative and well-written,"As a congregational rabbi interested in both the therapeutic and religious aspects of various disorders, I found this book to be well-written, clear and succinct in its formulations. This is a very useful tool for clergy of all religious faiths, as well as those in the mental health profession interested in a spiritual approach to their work."
3,It's OK...,"This CD has tons of music...but it seems to be a low quality recording of most of them??? There are also some pretty obscure tunes. I am a big Disco Fan, but some of these tunes are new to me."
2,The Music Isn't Remarkably Popular... Neither Are the Notes,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I REPEAT.There are so many songs in here I've never heard of. Also, most songs in this book are very religious. ""Happy Birthday Jesus""? My my. The few popular songs that ARE in here are not arranged very well. It's a great book if you are overly religious and not so good at playing the piano."
4,I never received the item.,"I never received this book of Christmas songs. I recently remarried and changed my name and address on my Amazon profile, but this is the second time that the selected seller apparently did not have access to the new information. I still want the book...I have tried to email everyone, but as of today have had no response. Can anyone help?"
2,"Nice book, bad print job","The book and songs are what I was looking for, but it has a problem. The book I received has poor print quality, slightly smudged like a poor photo copy. As an early intermediate player, the quality slows my reading down just enough to make it difficult. I found the book in a local piano store with excellent quality. I would have said this only to Amazon, if there were a way. I won't chance a music book from Amazon again, but will continue buying other books."
4,Just in time for Christmas,Received book just before Christmas. Has most of my favorites in one place. Nice book and I'm still using it now in February!
4,Better than others we tried.,We tried a couple of machines from other companies including one from Cabellas. This one outshines the others. We had no problem processing a whole hog and several pounds of deer sausage in one afternoon. Fairly easy to clean. Just remember to oil the parts. Great price on great product.
1,not recommended,"This item is not exactly cheap, but it is poorly designed and cheaply built. It broke down after less than a year of light use. Not recommended for any purpose."
3,Professional Meat Grinder,This grinder doesn't have the power I expected for a Professional Meat Grinder. Also made the mistake of washing the parts in the dishwasher. My fault as I didn't read the instruction book thoroughly. The dishwasher took the polished finish off completely. A bit let down.
1,differnet model,"be careful when you order this, they will send you the newer, weaker, less powerful model mg855 which is only 350 watts, while the mg 800 is 450 watts"
5,Great Grinder,I normally do not do reviews and not unless I have had the product for awhile...time enough to really evaluate. We have now had this grinder for probably close to two years. We grind 35 to 40 pounds of beef every 5 weeks for raw dog food for our two dogs. Never have had any issues or complaints. If meat is cut up small enough (1 inch cubes) the meat feeds very smoothly and very rarely is the plunger used to force feed. I keep seeing reviews referring to rust but I have not ever had that issue. I wash the parts thoroughly and allow to air dry and never any issue of rust. Clean up is very easy. I can highly recommend this grinder to anyone in need of one.
1,Broke the first time I used it.,"I was excited to get this in the mail. I had a ton of sausage to make and couldn't wait to get started. This was slightly more powerful then the Villaware I previously owned so I thought it would easily meet my expectations. Unfortunately, it broke upon the first use. It would make this horrible screeching noise and then stop before I could shut it off. I then spoke to a buddy of mine who recommended the Northern Idustrial tool model and I ended up buying that and am super happy. I went from a LEM model that I sent back, to the waring then to the Northern one - each one cheaper then the previous and I am most happy with the cheapest one. Just goes to show you more expensive isn't always better."
5,Great grinder for homemade pet food,"I just made 10# of raw cat food and this grinder ROCKS! Absolutely no problem what-so-ever grinding boes, skin and meat. I used 10# raw chicken and the worst part was cutting up the chickens. This grinder didn't hesitate once during the whole process. Clean up was easier than I expected and the machine is relatively easy to take apart to get clean. If you are committed to making raw dog and cat food, this grinder would serve you well."
2,Very Disappointed with Motor,"After grinding one pound of deer meat, the motor burnt out. Since this was a gift for a friend, it is extremely disappointing to have to claim a warranty after only one hour of use. For the price, I was expecting much more."
2,poor quality,"We put it together and turned it on and the whole thing shook, this was with no food in it."
5,One whole beast went through without a problem,"After reading a Cooks Illustrated that rated this grinder first, I tried to buy it. My boyfriend hunts deer, and we've tried a couple of other meat grinders; they got clogged up, and we were wary of anything that didn't weigh over 75 pounds and belonged at a processing plant. I'll admit, we only put one deer down this thing so far, but it was a big buck, and we made lots of burger. We didn't have to use the reverse, the machine was easy to clean, even without the bread method they suggest. I'd be surprised if there's a better grinder at this price. I was ready to move up to commercial/restaurant grade, but this is it. Loud? Yes. But if you bring home the goods to grind, you're tough enough to deal with the sound. If you're just grinding vegetables for something, this grinder will certainly work, but you may not need it. It's just one of the best lower priced ones for grinding large chunks of raw animal."
2,Disapointed,"The description of ""brushed stainless steel"" and the picture gives the impression this item is sturdier than it actually is.When you grind the simplest pieces the attachment section (actual grinder)sways. The motor is very loud and only has one speed. The ginder section is lightweight. The cutting part (rotary knife)actually showed rust after only one use. I had ordered this item as I wanted a more powerful unit than my kitchen aid mixer with the meat grinder attachment. The ""kitchen aid"" meat grinder attachment although some of the components are made of plastic is of better quality."
4,Great product for the money. Gets the job done.,"I recently purchased this grinder and have ran about 100lbs of meat through it. It is powerful enough to run beef straight through the medium grind, but with game meat, I noticed that it will really bog down if you don't do the course grind first and then the medium grind.One other key tip I noticed is if you cut your meat in strips and feed it in, it will just pull the strip in and you don't even need to use the push tube. The real work comes when you are doing a re-grind. That takes a while to pack the meat in and feed it through.All in all it was definitely worth the money and will probably be purchasing another for double action."
1,Died on 4th use,"This noisy little monster made it almost to the end of its fourth batch of sausage, then let out a terrific howl and expired. A friend saved the day by bringing over his Kitchen Aid stand mixer with a cheap looking plastic grinder attachment. I was dubious, but his machine quietly chewed through several batches of sausage like it was just another day at work.Why all the noise and drama with the Waring MG-800 Pro? Even when it's not breaking down, it sounds like a chainsaw cutting through an iron tree.Let's see how the seller responds to my return request...Update: December 11, 2012Seller requires ALL original packaging, including the box, otherwise, no refund or replacement. Heck, I recycled that mess the first week I had the machine!I called the manufacturers, who were nice enough. I sent the machine to them (on my dime) for repair. Now let's see how long it takes them to make this right..."
5,Great appliance for a great price!,"Read the reviews carefully and choose the Waring MG-800 Pro based on its reviews and I was not disappointed. Well crafted appliance, with an easy clean up and its a work horse. It is kind of loud, but found that if I wear my noise canceling ear buds, I'm not bothered by it. If you make sausage or just want to grind your own chopped meat or poultry, this is a great unit. Combined with Amazon Prime the cost can't be beat!"
5,Go no further. This is it.,"Unless you are in business, you will find this grinder quite adequate. I started grinding pork when I was 6 yrs old (really)with a large hand grinder. As time has moved along, I have tried (through purchase or borrowing) several different home grinders. I process 4-6 deer a year. I have never been satisfied, until now. This grinder has enough amps in the motor to process quickly. I processed 3 deer recently. I did not have to take the grinder apart to clear the stringy fascia even once. Grinding was effortless. I like the forward and reverse switch mechanism for clearing jams. Reverse automatically stops when you remove pressure. Since I didn't have to actually use it, I can't tell you that it works great. All peices ahave a good fit. The stainless makes cleaning rather easy. Truth in advertising wouldn't allow me to promote this as a Professional grinder (which I have used), but I think that this grinder has found a home. It's definitely worth the money."
4,Waring professional Meat Grinder,"So far so good. The grinder arrived timely and in good condition. Have made several batches of game sausage, mostly bear, and it has done the job well. I'm afraid to try grinding a whole chicken for dog food as it doesn't seem powerful enough for that. But, we like this machine."
4,Nice Machine,looks and feels to be of good build quality;rather loud when running;but then so is my music...have not had opportunity to put the grinder to the test yet;so only give it 4 stars for now. after I do some grindin n stuffin; I will update this review
4,"This is a good, thorough beginning book on Shostakovich","Over the course of the last few months I have been nursing an ever increasing love of Shostakovich. This is the first book I have read on the master and, in light of other readings I have done (Volkov, Fanning, MacDonald, Wilson)this turned out to be a good primer. Its strength lies in that (outside from a few quotes from Testimony) it stays away from the Volkov controversy and focuses mostly on facts (i.e. who Zhdanov, Sollertinsky, Meyerhold were, the political horrors of Stalin, his major works in relationship to his life). For those searching for a book a that isn't too daunting, but will still give them a thorough introduction, this is a good start."
2,Destroyed in minutes...,"This thing didn't have a chance against my year old boxer, he started pulling off inch long chunks within 10 minutes. Not really worth the money."
4,Future Big Beats,"Well what an album. To start off with I can say that if you are a fan of big beat, acid jazz, trip hop, hip hop, or any million different (but similar) styles of electronic music then you should definitely check this album out. The various tracks on the album have only one similarity, that is that they're all funky. Apart from that they're all fairly different in styles of rhythm and beat, and that's the main focus of this album. Strange and sometimes very complex beats and rhythms mixed with beautiful melodies.The highlights of the album are defiantly track 1.) Laid Back by Space Raiders, Track 5.) Don't Mess With People by Mandrill, Track 9.) Coming From the Top by Thievery Corporation and Track 12.) remix of Run On by Moby.This album is unmixed and is therefore perfect for the CD DJ's out there..."
5,Excellent figure!,"Beautifully sculpted with outstanding colors and detail. The Blue Dragon Blade is only balanced in her hands instead of actually being gripped, so you're limited in how you can position it, but that's a small nitpick. Overall this figure is outstanding!"
4,Nice Brass,"I was looking for something a bit more lively, but this is still some good music. I was not disappointed."
4,great headphones,"Comfortable, lightweight, great price. I've had these phones for over a year, and got this pair for my sister-in-law who says they were life-changing! Love that it takes a AAA battery, and that unlike Bose NR phones, they work (not in NR mode, of course) without the battery. I had Bose NRs, and had to return them 3 times because of malfunction. They are also not as well constructed as the Sony's. I am not rough on the phones, I basically only wear them at the gym, but the Bose earcup swivels broke twice during the 10 years I had been using Bose phones. Sound quality is fine, noise reduction good. I can't say that they are as good as the Bose because I can't make a direct comparison, but I love mine and if they ever need replacement I hope I can get another pair."
2,Great until they fell apart after a few months!,"These headphones had great sound quality, were very effective in blocking out external sound, and came with a flight adapter. However, after only a few months, both of the earpieces broke of my headphones. I had taken great care of them and used the carrying case that accompanied them. So, 4 stars for the sound quality, but 0 stars for durability! For the price, look for a more durable pair--unless you want to throw out $100 every three months for a replacement!"
1,Not for small heads,"The price, construction and quality are all fine.But, the headband is designed for a medium-large adult head. My head is small, and even with the band adjusted all the way in, the cups always slipped to be half off, half on my earlobes. This is uncomfortable, and obviously ruins the noise reduction capabilities and bass response.These now sit in my drawer at home, I travel frequently, but without comfort there is no reason to take these with me.It's great that it comes with its own travel pouch, but it is tricky to fold it up into it."
3,Good headset for the price,"Is this the perfect set of noise cancelling headphones? No. Not by a long shot. But, for the price I think this is a very good product.The noise cancelling works well enough for most situations, although it isn't able to, for instance, truly elimate the whine of an airplane engion in the background. When not in use, the headphones fold up into the very nice little included pouch, which is much more convenient than most competing offerings.All in all, I am happy with the purchase."
2,"Great Sound, Poor Construction Quality","Had these for about a year, carried them with me everywhere. Flights, trips, and work. Great sound (can get distorted at high volumes) and great noise cancellation, however, these have literally fell apart. Both ear ""muffs"" have fallen/broken off the headrest. Not durable."
2,I don't think these are true noise canceling headphones,"These were the first ""noise canceling"" headphones I ever purchased. I was never impressed with the feature. It changes the sound of the content dramatically and I had to wonder if this was just a bass boost coupled with a filter to block out the high frequencies.Well, I recently purchased a Nokia BH-905i and I'm pretty convinced that Sony's noise cancellation is nothing more than trickery. The Nokia's offer true noise cancellation with microphones that listen to the surrounding environment and actively send audio to the ear pieces to cancel out the noise. It's really quite startling. You become aware of your own heart beating.Yes, the Nokia's are much more expensive but if it's true noise canceling you are after, pass on these Sony's."
3,Meh,I washed my Apple in-ear noise isolating earbuds on accident so while looking for replacements I decided to give these a try.The sound quality was good. Noise cancellation was also good . . . Problem is it gave me a headache after about a half hour of use.I loaned them to a coworker and ultimately gave them to my partner and neither of them complained about headaches so it must just be me.I ended up ordering another pair of Apple's noise isolating earbuds and foam tips from complyfoam.
3,Sony Headphones,"These came in great time and in great condition, calling them noise cancelling is a little misleading....I thought they were going to block out all noise....they do not"
2,Broke within 6 months of moderate use,Cheap plastic housing broke off after trying to close and fold headphones to be placed into the small case provided. POORLY CONSTRUCTED!! Just bought a pair of JVC 250's great construction and good case for storage.
2,Not as I hoped,I was very hopeful that these headphones would work for me. I am in an area that is pretty noisy and having the comfort of not hearing the noise would have been very comforting to me. With these headphones the surrounding nosie heard may not be as bad as other headphones but the nosie still filtered through. I am a little dissappointed. I gave the Sony MDR-NC40 two stars because they are I will say better then other headphones I have used.
5,Sony MDR-NC40 Noise Cancelling Headphone (Black),"Sony MDR-NC40 Noise Cancelling Headphone (Black)The noise cancelling works so great, I can tune out just about any background noise including industrial.Sound quality is excellent.Also, when plugged into my Droid, it works great to talk to my dad since he puts the phone on speaker and talks to me from across the living room. I used to have to strain to hear what he was saying, now he comes in loud and clear."
4,Great for glasses wearers,"As a glasses wearer I often find headphones uncomfortable as they squish my glasses arms. But these are very comfy with no discomfort what so ever.My only criticism is when they say 'de-noising' although it block some sound out, they aren't truely de-noising, but for the price and the compact form they have are still worth it"
2,"Bulky, and mediocre Noise Reduction","Prior to these headphones I used theSennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling Headphones, which I used for about 2 years. Now having used the Sony's for about 3 months, I really miss my old Sennheisers.Even when folded the Sonys are still pretty bulky. Unlike many noise canceling headphones, the Sonys don't fold flat which makes them really hard to pack into a notebook bag or carry in a jacket pocket. Also, the noise reduction is not that great. In noisy environments I find myself checking to see if they're turned on.Sony did get a couple things right: the battery holder is compact and sleek, and there's the perfect length of cable. In comparison to the Sennheiser PXC-250, these Sonys pick up less interference from wireless signals."
4,"Great price, very good noise cancellation, good sound","I first purchased a pair of slightly-cheaper, over the ear noise cancellation headphones from another brand I will no mention. The bass response was so terrible, the cans were very tinny, and the bass would distort at ANY volume. To boot, the noise cancellation (despite promises it would reduce it by 70%) was almost non-existent.I took those back and purchased the Sony pair. Wow, what a difference. It really does seem to reduce noise by around 70% (not the 80% claimed), and that is enough for me. It will reduce the dull roar at coffee shops to polite chatter; the coffee grinding is a low buzz. The sound is also pretty good. The bass is great (sometimes TOO good).My only qualms would be the fact that the pair NEEDS a battery to sound good. That's a design flaw. Other than that, I am pretty happy with these (especially with the price tag being 1/3 of the Bose sets)."
2,Disappointing sound quality,"I'll actually be returning these. The sound quality is horrendous- overly boomy bass and muddy midtones. The quality improves slightly when the NC on, but is still very colored.Look elsewhere."
3,"The sound is great, but what about the overall contruction..","For the price that I paid (considering I was using the rest of my $60 gift card), I am in love with these headphones. They are equip with a stand alone noise cancel control and mute button that works to the T.The only problem that I have with them is the overall construction of the product. I admit for the price and the fact that they fold up is great; but they are a bit flimsy. the are on attached to the head phones tend to slide and the speakers tend to wiggle around quite a bit. I still don't know how to feel about it. It doesn't seem like they will break anytime soon, as long as I don't do any strenuous activities with them, but they do tend to slide around my head if I am not stationary.Overall, I am very satisfied with them and they serve the purpose of my library headphones, but I would recommend them to anyone going for a jog.Enjoy.."
2,Poor sound quality and noise cancelling,"The only good thing of this product is the reasonable price, and the case goes with it. The sound quality, as many people mentioned in the review, it very poor. You have to turn on the noise cancelling function to hear a bearable sound, which is ridiculous. Don't even mention the noise cancelling, since it is not effective at all. I used it on two flights, and it only reduces about 20% of the engine noise. It is way worse than the Bose one, but considering the price, it makes sense... I don't recommend this product."
2,not what was advertised--great sound; not great noise cancellation,pros:great sound qualitycons:sound cancellation is insignificant. (at points couldn't tell the difference between active noise cancellation being on and off)conclusion:great sound quality but if you are looking for both features look somewhere else
3,Great sound....inside,Great headphones on paper. They have top notch sound and can fold into a compact pouch easy for travel. BUT BEWARE!!!! Any wind severely penetrates into the headphones and creates disturbance. This seems like a big enough misfire to merit 3 stars. If you intend to use these headphones indoors...GO FOR IT!
4,Decent on-ear performance,"I prefer on-ear headphones. These headphones feel just a little tight on my head which is probably good for keeping them on while riding the commuter train. There is almost no sound 'bleed', when I have them of my ears, around my neck I can not hear the music. The sound reproduction is quite good, full bodied without an overwhelming bass. The noise reduction does not amp up the content, which is excellent, though other SONY n/c headphones seem to remove more ambient noise. The travel case is fantastic, well constructed with slots for an included airline adapter and a supplied battery. The battery compartment is midway on the wire rather than in an ear-cup or by the prong, which is nice for getting weight off the headset, but the battery compartment does not seem to hang conveniently. There is a pocket clip to the compartment which I've clipped to where the wire splits to go to ear earpiece."
4,"Good Performance, Nice price","As a frequent business traveler, I was looking for some noise canceling headphones but did not want to spend the chunk of change on Bose. After reading some of the reviews on these Sony's here and other places, I decided to give them a shot. I'm glad I did! Now, I'm no audiophile, nor do I have much to compare these to from a noise canceling perspective, but they do their job well. Yes, you have to have them turned on for them to sound decent, but the battery life seems very good. I've made 3 trips to China and a few domestic trips with the original battery still in them. Probably 60 hours conservatively (I only use them on the planes). I can keep them on for a 13 hour flight with out any discomfort, and I am very pleased with the degree of noise canceling."
4,thank Sony! I can finally sleep in long flight...,"NC40 work perfectly and sound better than the price suggest. And yes, this is actually comfortable enough to wear for long flight. NC work well enough for me to get some much needed sleep in planes. Battery life is good too!update Jan 2013:The NC 40 gave me enough confident with the Sony noise cancellation technology that I actually brought a pair of Sony MDR-NC100D. The digital version of this technology work even better than the NC40. In fact I can sleep fairly nice even there were two screaming babies near my seat!! BTW, I gave my NC40 to my mom and she sleep like a (not screaming) baby in long flight!"
1,very cheaply made fell apart 2nd use,"Bought these and used twice, second time the plastic headpiece snapped. Very thin plastic. Sony will not replace. Buy something else if you want to use more than twice!"
2,Don't Buy These,"The sound quality is mediocre, and without the EQ/noise canceling switched on the natural sound of the drivers is pathetic. I mainly use them just for the noise canceling, which probably gets you 10 or 15 dB of attenuation. I have no idea where they get their claim of ""80% noise reduction"". They also broke pretty quickly. The drivers separated from the headband. There are so many junky headphones out there and this is just another pair. I am an audio professional."
1,Very bad product,"Bad, buy some other. No bass is heard wrong, they sound weird, have the battery on or not makes no difference."
2,Hurts My Ears/Head,"I didn't even have the chance to try out the noise cancelling.. didn't have a AAA battery on hand. Unfortunately for the headphones, they're very uncomfortable in a way that I have them on for more than 5 minutes and my head starts aching. I don't have a large head (usually I run into the problem with things are too big for my head) and my younger sister tried them on and had that problem too. They press against your ear in a way that is rather uncomfortable. I haven't had over-ear headphones in a while but I don't remember my last pair being like that.The sound seemed pretty good and the earphones themselved muffled sounds without noise-cancelling on, but there's really no point in having them if they give me a headache."
3,Hurts my ears,"The headphones are compact and easy to travel with. They had great sound for the on board movie and were okay on noise reduction. Because they sit on the ear rather than over/around it, the pressure from the headphones hurt my ears for days my trip (actually just my right ear). I coudn't even sleep on my right side. If you really want noise reduction and comfort, Bose are better (but I had two of those break so chose not to purchase them again)"
1,Battery Eater,It consumes a lot of batteries; you have to change the battery almost every two days. The battery chamber is heavy and annoying. It is expensive product compared to its quality. Not recommended.
4,"Nice headphones, fair price","I've had these head phones for several years now. They've become one of my favorite headphone sets. Very comfortable...I've worn them for a couple of hours at a time when traveling with no discomfort. Ear cups are very soft. They fold up fairly well. I turn the NR switch on whenever I use them as the sound is so much nicer, perhaps a tad heavy on the bass, though. Not sure how long the battery lasts in the NR, but seems like I don't have to change the battery that often, unless I accidentally leave the switch on for a length of time. They seem fairly well constructed since I often throw them into my computer bag or a suitcase when I'm in a hurry, but after about 3 years they've held up okay. I often use them at home, too, when I want to relax to some good music. I would probably buy them again if something happened to these."
3,Good Buy for The Money,"The noise cancelling feature doesn't perform as well as I would like, but for the price I paid, it's certainly a good buy. They feel a little flimsy, but they haven't broken in 6 months of steady travel, so overall I'm pretty pleased."
3,Okay for the price but not comfortable,"I had bought this headphone in 2008 and after using it a few times, I gave it to my dad partly because he was a more frequent flier than me (and therefore needed the noise cancelation more than me) and also because it hurt my left ear lobe after keeping it on for a few hours.Sound quality - Not too great. Bass is higher. I felt my ipod's earphone's sound quality was better.Noise reduction - about 60%, which is good for the price when you compare to Bose headphones. Bose gives exceptional noise cancelation but the price is also ridiculously high.Comfort - My left earlobe (or was it right? I don't remember now) always hurt after having it on for an hour or more. Don't know if it's just my ear but anyway I didn't find it comfortable. Next time I'll go for an over-the-ear headphone than an on-the-ear one... i think that'll be more comfortable."
4,Looking fro quiet.,"The headphones are comfortable and they do lessen the ambient noise, but not as much as I was hoping. I am able to operate some noisy yard equipment and hear a CD player with a audio book through them. They also work well in a normal environment without the active noise canceling turned on. So far so good."
3,Detailed analysis of varied art works,Visions of space has a lot of art work and I was suprised to see how many different forms there were.The language is quite complex and I don't think younger readers would enjoy it as much as adults.I like space but that is not really a good reason to buy this book.If you like mordern or pop art than this is worth a look.
3,The Old Lamplighter,"The whole CD was not that impressive. Old songs are good but most were not particularly well done. However, The Old Lamplighter was EXACTLY like the original. Romantic and well re-mastered. Would be ideal to buy this without the rest. Howver, the price of the total CD was worth this one recording."
2,Things are not what they seem,"I'm a very big fan of the Beatles. This dvd is somewhat of a disapointment. There are 4 songs listed on the dvd box that are not on the dvd. The fool on the hill, I am the walrus, just to name a few.Most clips are from the Ed Sullivan show. Quality of this dvd is good and bad. Be sure you want this before you order. I consider the Beatles to be the best band in rock n roll history. Long live Liverpool England!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"This hat is way too floppy and much too big, plus you can see the liner when you have it on. But the material is nice and it blocks the sun very well."
5,American English the world language,"I'm a brazilian and here in Brazil to study American English is a priority for everyone. Berlitz provide one of the most effective way to learn (with the books) e speak english (with the tapes). I have studied english with the 3 books (Speak English Portuguese, Berlitz), and I felt that I have improved soo much (I know that there's much to learn). I have never visited the USA, but I certain that with this book I will have no difficult in maintain a good comunication. Please, I'm knowing that Berlitz have new books with tapes ""English, The Berlitz way level 1, 2 and 3 - for portuguese speakers"", and I'm waiting Amazon make this new course available. Realy, everything I'm writing here I learned with Berlitz books, this books are excelent. Thanks million to Berlitz and Amazon, you are helping million of people to study english."
5,Dorothy writes the best books,"This is my second favorite of her books (with Return to Red Castle being the best). If only she would write more books like these. If you have never read her books, they are a must for everyone. I am not a book lover, but her books seem to touch my heart in just the right ways. I have read this book at least 4 times. Her descriptions of the characters are so vivid it leaves an impression on you long after you have (regrettably) finished the book. She has written 7 books(that I know of) and her first 5 are the best. Jayhawk, Flower of the Winds, Shadow Song, Mermaids Purse and Return to Red Castle. DOROTHY... Please write more books like your first 5."
5,I loved! The charachters were all so unique!,"I loved how Dorothy Keddington used so many different kinds of people to make this story work. I also loved how the plot took so many twists and turns, it definately kept me guessing."
5,PLEASE write more!!!,"Dorothy PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE write more books!! I have them all and read them over and over... I cannot get enough. Soft, clean, romantic.... When life seems to rough I love to escape into your books!!!!"
3,Cute but not so good,"This book was very cute and had great pictures, but it only covered the ages of 1-5. It did not have room for pictures of sonograms and of pre birth."
5,An Excellent Book for all animal lovers!,"This is a lovely book, very well put together. It is a touching story of a Golden Retriever who ""works"" at a gas station. All animal lovers will enjoy the adventures of this courageous, loving and willing Golden, who gave so much and asked for so little in return."
4,NBA Live 99,Woooo! This game has 21 Century graphics that will knock your socks off. I was desperate for an action packed NBA game since I'm a huge B-ball fan. Get ready be blown back on your tailfin!
2,RINGS ACCURATE AND TRUE BUT NOT SCARY,"I felt that the paranormal events this family experienced, as told in this book, were accurate and true. It seemed the writer wanted to tell the story without sensationalism. He succeeded to the point that the story moved slow and was not compelling. I wanted to like the book more as I admired the writer's intent. I was surprised that by the book's end, everyone affected was still clueless and blaming the events that occurred on ghosts and hauntings. This made the ending very unsatisfying to me. Read it if you're looking for an accurate account of the paranormal. If you're looking for chills, you won't find any here unless you are easily frightened."
3,Good Story...but not enough there.,"I read quite a bit of ghost stories and non-fiction new age stories and this one doesn't really measure up. It is very short, lacks detail and leaves me at the end of the booking saying ""That's it?"" It is a good book for a very quick read, but not worth the retail purchase price."
3,Shakespeare for everyone,"This is the perfect book for Shakespeare 101 classes. You get the original play and a translation that keeps the spirit of the text.But don't expect to find a word by word translation (you'd be better off with a dictionary of Elizabethan English), or a detailed analysis of the characters and main themes (Sparknotes has another book for that). It's just the play, easy to read."
1,Decorative Discomfort,"I received the Zohar flat, tried it on, and promptly sent it back. The sole on this shoe is not flexible--I'm not sure how someone would actually walk in these...so unless your main transportation is by litter, you might find these useless."
5,Excellent recording of a brilliant artist,"Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was, perhaps, the most intensely spirtual vocalists/musicians to have lived. Regardless of personal beliefs, this collection of music will touch your heart and soul. Through Nusrat's voice, it is abundantly clear that this is a man leading a performance of talented artists through an emotionally intense musical experience.For those not familiar with the works of the Ali Khan family, this is an excellent starting place. The songs are long and cover a range of energy and emotion.For those familiar with other Nusrat recordings, this particular recording is a bit ""warmer"" than what is often encountered. In particular, there seem to be more tracks in the recording and more focus was placed on doing a true mix as opposed to trying to capture the sound in a more traditional ""live recording"" fashion.This is an excellent recording of a tremendous artist at his best. Highly recommended to both to the initiate and the long time fan!"
3,Ok but....,"Being a big fan of Nusrat's, I have listened to many of his recordings. Many have been brilliant, but i cannot say the same about this one. The album contains very meaningful and emotional songs, as well as religious. However, they are not very good as far as Nusrat's voice goes. The title is 'The Final Studio Recordings', so I asume that they were recorded during the end of Nusrat's career and life. Therefore, he was in ill health. This explains they poor quality of voice. But obviously it does not matter, the Ustad has proved what he had to, the fact that he WAS the BEST!"
4,Great read - I couldn't put it down,"Although it's told from Hamsher's perspective (giving a somewhat biased view of events), this book gives some very revealing insights into the way that movies really get made. As an example, she describes Richard Rutowski, one of the individuals who received screenwriting credit for ""Natural Born Killers"" as merely the person who provided Oliver Stone with a steady supply of drugs and women during production! (she said that the crew nicknamed him ""Pimpowski""). If you ever wondered how a studio can spend $50 million producing a film, this book will open your eyes...The book doesn't really have any socially redeeming value, but if you liked the movie ""Natural Born Killers"", you will find it fascinating and amusing - especially her descriptions of the off-camera activities during several key scenes in the movie. I started it at 10pm one night and read it all the way through without stopping."
5,A great Hollywood tale from a female point of view,"In KILLER INSTINCT, producer Jane Hamsher tells the story of how she came to be involved in making the film NATURAL BORN KILLERS, one of the most controversial movies of the decade. From meetings with original (then unknown) story scribe Quentin Tarantino to defending the violence of the picture overseas with Oliver Stone, Hamsher takes us on a whirlwind journey through the Hollywood system. I'm not a huge fan of NATURAL BORN KILLERS, but found myself totally absorbed in this book. The story of how the movie got made should be extremely interesting to anyone interested in the subject of filmmaking, and Jane tells it with lots of humor and visual style."
1,lightweight,"This book is pretty flimsy. Other reviewers have noted that it is a fast read, nothing special. But, come on...there are so many GOOD books out there, why waste your time?"
2,"c'mon guys, i mean, like.........","who's this ditz kidding? her partner's a fat oaf, the bozo meter rates a potential's b.o.this man is a meany, this one's a crook, this one's dumb.i mean like.....y she hatin?"
4,A book that's not afraid to blast the industry.,It was refreshing to read a book by Hollywood insiders that isn't afraid to be honest. Hamsher's often-scathing perspectives on big egos such as Quentin Tarantino and Oliver Stone was both satsfying and entertaining. Natural Born Killers wasn't a great film but this book gives you an idea of what might have been...
4,The Player meets Living in Oblivion,"Nuts-and-bolts, wonderfully gossipy account of how to produce a movie .Hamsher's conversational tone draws you in and pulls you along on the wild ride that was the shoot for NBK.Yes, she is somewhat self-aggrandizing (as one would expect from any decent producer), but her partner Don Murphy comes across extremely well. He's about the only one, though. Her portrait of Oliver Stone as a drug and sex-obsessed maniac is pitch-perfect (and believable).Come to think of it, an enterprising director could make a damn good film out of this story (I see Sarah Polley as Hamsher, Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Don Murphy, and Stanley Tucci as Oliver Stone.)"
5,Dreams can come true . . .,"This is absolutly one of the best insider book ever written. Together with ""Final Cut"" and ""Hit & Run"", this is the top titles. Jane Hamsher is without doubt one of the best AND funniest producers to come out of the Hollywood mayhem for years. If you're are just the least interested in either Oliver Stone, producing or just the other side of Hollywood, this is the book for you. And it also paints a different kind of picture of the ""wunderboy"" Quentin Tranatino, and when you're finish with the book you'll say: ""Goddam she was right, he is a fad""."
1,JUNK,"Instead of buying this product, buy an external drive bay. They are more expensive, but they are 100% compatible. This set does not work with my Dell laptop. Brilliantstores gave terrible helpdesk support and BenQ support said that these kits are junk and never work. How true they were. I really wish that I would have just spent the extra money on an external bay.."
2,Nice gadget,"This is a nice gadget for accessing data from an HD that will not boot up, HOWEVER, the""Coolmax SATA and IDE-USB 2.0 Converter"" is a much more stable item."
1,Don't know if it works or not,"I was hoping to transfer files from 2 old hard drives onto my new computer. Package arrived OK, but the included driver CD was broken in half and couldn't be used. The package is not a box but a plastic bag. It was literally stuffed into the mailing envelope. I emailed company and was given an alternative way to get my computer to recognize the attached cable with hard drive. NO LUCK. Tried it on a couple computers with different operating systems, Windows 7 64-bit and Windows Vista. Emailed company again. They gave me a return authorization number. Really? The postage to send it back would have cost almost as much as the cable did. So, this piece of unuseable hardware sits in a box.To their credit, the company did respond within a day or 2 of my emails. However, they should have been able to supply me with a new CD or a link to download the driver. Searches for the driver yielded no results that worked.Not terribly happy with this cable or the company that supplied it."
5,Great and simple,I used this product right away to find out which of my drives laying around were good. It turns out they were all defective but one as I had suspected. I then used the one drive to back up my photos. I plan on using it when my friends ask me to fix their PC. Most of the time they have viruses and such that I need to work around. Now I can just pull their drive and scan and clean it with my PC. Awesome price for how easy and useful it is.
2,I can't figure out how to work it!,"I got it really quick, it came in 2 days with regular shipping which was great. but i can't get it to work! so there was no use in haveing it fast if i can't get it to work. should have just bought a more expensive one. Guess i got what i paid for.If someone could help me figure it out that would be nice too"
5,GOOD INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS PUZZLES,"VERY HELPFUL. SHE DOESN'T LEAVE YOU WONDERING WHAT CAN I DO, OR TRY, OR WHERE TO START. IT'S ALL THERE FOR BEGINNER OR DIFFICULT PUZZLE SOLVER. THE ONLY BOOK OF IT'S KIND OUT THERE ...I.B.E. MASS."
4,Good for a beginner,"The puzzles in this book are good confidence-builders for a beginner. The increase in difficulty from one level to the next is much more gradual than in some other sudoku books I've used. This allows the user to really fine-tune the level of challenge they're up to, and to add new techniques gradually.For a serious sudoku player, though, only the most difficult puzzles in this book would be at all interesting."
3,COULD HAVE GONE FARTHER,"I WAS HOPING THAT SHE WOULD HAVE GONE INTO THE SOLVING OF MORE DIFFICULT PUZZLES. HOWEVER, I THINK SHE DID A GOOD JOB IN SOLVING THE MEDIUM PUZZLE SOLUTIONS."
2,Where is the (instructional) beef?,"Have you ever wandered who writes 5 star reviews? I certainly do everytime I get a flop...And this book is one.I have been playing Sudoku for about a month, my only learning tool has been reading some instructional material on the web. Based on the reviews in Amazon, I got this book to see what else could I learn. What a dissappointment!!!The book is very basic, as others have pointed out, it only goes through very simple instructions. The book is divided in sections: Easy, Medium, Difficult and Super-Difficult, preceeding each section there are a few pages of instructional material, followed by 40-50 puzzles.The instruction is tidiously verbose, making it difficult to follow. It takes a page to explain something that could have been explained in a paragraph. It got two stars because of the number of puzzles, otherwise its instructional value is minimum."
1,very confusing,"Carol Vorderman calls herself a master, but i dont think so. She only started sudoku in 2005, not even a year. The way she explains her methods in the book are confusing. There are much easier ways to find out the answers. Any logical person would know that there are easier ways to find answers than how she says how to find the answers. Her methods take a long time. The methods are correct, but it just makes the player (person doing sudoku) take longer to do the puzzles. I did one of the puzzles that are ""super-difficult"" in her book without using any of her advice and I was able to do it in 10 minutes comfortably. You don't need her hints to do sudoku puzzles. You should buy a book that has pure sudoku puzzles in it."
5,Excellent Guide!,"I started doing Soduku puzzles while vacationing in the U.K. I picked up Carol's book for the plane ride back to America. I was already able to finish these puzzles, but the techniques presented in the book allowed me to do so much faster and more efficiently. The guide to super-difficult Soduku puzzles is a godsend."
2,Where's the beef?,"I'm a new Sudoku learner and although I'm a pretty smart guy, this book isn't all that great. For instance, in the (mini) lesson on Medium difficulty puzzles, Vorderman brings up the logic rule she calls ""the only one that fits."" The explanation is insufficient, the example doesn't make sense. And then a few pages later, where she walks you through an entire puzzle to practice everything that you've just learned, the rule is never used!The amount of tutorial material in this book is miniscule. (She probably could have written this in a day.) Lots of puzzles, but I wanted a tutorial book and this wasn't it."
4,Probably the best introduction for beginning solvers,"Unlike other sudoku books, which are essentially collections of puzzles(and thus a borderline waste of your money, as there are 1) several computer programs that will generate as many puzzles as your heart desires for free and 2) the sudoku magazines of Dell Publications, which prints bimonthly (in the United States) a magazine of 200 puzzles, for around 3 dollars)this book has useful teaching content. It goes through the basic techniques of discerning values for sudoku, using logic.However, I have discovered every technique in this book on my own, and so its usefulness was personally limited. This is why the book did not get 5 stars.This is the book I would buy as a gift for an interested novice in sudoku. I am awaiting Vorderman's book on more advanced solving techniques; such a book should eventually appear if the sudoku craze does not die down."
2,Master Sudoku yeah right,"I thought that Carol Vorderman did an excellent job explaining her different techniques in a nice step by step fashion. Aside from that I felt the book was very lacking. I ordered this book a week or two after I first started doing Sudoku puzzles. When the book finally arrived I had already learned, on my own, all the techniques that she explained. She classifies her different techniques by skill level. I do not feel that there is an increased skill level for each technique but rather a specific time and place for them. She also stated that her techniques would allow you to complete any puzzle without guessing. This is not so and there are some really advanced techniques out there that she does not even discuss like the x-wing and the swordfish technique. I would only recommend this book to a person who has never done a puzzle yet and would be interested in learning."
2,Didn't work for me,"I have CFS and am continually looking for supplements to help me get a decent rest. I tried this and found out that it does nothing for me. I tried it for about a week and a half. It didn't help me get to sleep, and I didn't feel energized the next day. However, I think that these kinds of supplements don't work on everyone. I was disappointed that it didn't work for me, but it appears to work for many other people."
1,Pills Not Effective,Pills were of no value in improving my ability to fall asleep or to stay asleep.
1,Mom didnt like this product,"This product has lots of stuff in it... bleck! It hurt my mom, as well as, disappointed because she hoped that this would work from Dr. Teitenberg. It didnt work for her - hope it works for you."
2,Nada,"I started with one/night, then 2/night, then 3 and still nothing. Added 100mg 5-HTP and still nothing. Anyone have a clue why NOTHING helps me sleep?"
2,Disappointed,It doesn't work for me. I took it 1/2 hours before I went to bed and I stared at the ceiling for couple hours....... Very disappointed. I switched it back to Natural Sleep.
1,Didn't work for me,"Sorry , tried it for a couple weeks with no results. If this works for you then great, but I'm still looking for a natural way to get sleep"
5,"Finally, I am sleeping!","Enzymatic Therapy Revitalizing Sleep Formula, 90 CapsulesTried everything, literally, in the health food store to help me sleep. This, combined with melatonin, is what finally worked!"
2,Kept me awake,"So, this cleared my mind... but kept me awake. I can just take Theanine (one of the ingredients) to clear my mind. I don't know which ingredient is the one that keeps me awake, but this doesn't work for me. I had high hopes."
3,not strong enough for me,"The first 2 times I used it, I was happy that it worked so well. I mean I could really feel the effect of my body & mind leading into sleep while I was awake. It hasn't worked since and I take the max recommended which is 4. I've stopped using the pills for a while now but will probably try again just to see."
3,So So,Tried this for awhile but really didn't seem to help me sleep. I have read that is is a cumulative thing and maybe I should give it another chance.
5,"Finally, I can get some rest!","It took me awhile to figure out when was the best time to take this product and how much to take to get a good nights rest without taking more than necessary. After a few nights, I figured out that I need to take only 1-2 tablets right at bedtime and then go right to bed. It still takes me a short while to fall asleep but then at least I sleep soundly. Sometimes I will wake maybe once during the night but can easily fall right back to sleep and the next time I wake up is just before my alarm is set to go off and I feel like I'm ready to start my day! I was sceptical that this could work, but for me it's really helped a lot, especially with the ""quality"" of my sleep. Having fibromyalgia, the ""quality"" of your sleep really matters! I told my doctor about this formula and she said she may suggest it to some of her patients that don't necessarily want to take medications to help them sleep. I say, if it works, why not?!"
2,Didn't Revitalize Me or Help Me to Sleep,"Since I suffer from being tired all the time, I've read a lot of books on sleep, chronic fatigue, etc. One of the most comprehensive of these books is ""From Fatigued to Fantastic,"" by Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum. What he says seems to make a lot of sense.I researched all of the ingredients that people seemed to be saying were natural, over the counter products that helped people get to sleep and get deeper and better sleep. After having done this, I discovered that this ""Revitalizing Sleep Formula"" had more of these ingredients than most other products: valerian, passionflower, L-theanine, and hops.Unfortunately, after having taken ""Revitalizing Sleep Formula"" for a month, I've found that it doesn't really help me get to sleep. Also, I don't seem to be getting any better sleep. I was hoping that this formula would work as well as prescription sleep-aid products, but I've been disappointed.It may work for some, but it hasn't for me."
2,"""Russian"" is a marketing gimmick?","I do not rate here quality of the exercises; I rate my dissatisfaction with the author's advertising scheme.The author (or publisher) cleverly sells his creation under variety of names: for Russian speakers, for Chinese speakers etc. In fact, very little about this kit told me that it is customized for Russian speakers.The introductory letter, book of examples, and mouth-shape pictures are the same for everyone. To ""tailor"" the product to Russians, they left out half of the sounds on the cassettes, leaving only 24 supposedly difficult for us.There are no parallels between Russian and American sounds, no explanation of what is it that Russians do wrong with those sounds, even the word ""Russian"" is not mentioned anywhere except the front cover. Everywhere else it is ""your language"", so that the same kit can be sold to anyone.Do not choose this product in hope that it is made specially for us, Russians."
2,The author makes false claims to lure buyers,"this book is sold as an Accent training book that targets people who come from different backgrounds and have difference accents. However, there is no material in this book that focuses specifically on differences between Russian speech and American speech. Basically, the same book is being sold to Chinese, French, German etc. speakers. The only difference is the title of the book. Overall the book provides a good overview of typical American sounds but if you are looking for a book that focuses on your accent this is not the right book for you."
