5,Powerful,"""Professional"" - Yes, this thing is that. Once you plug it in and turn it on, you know you're dealing with a high powered product. The cut is great and I expect many years of use. The unit is a little heavy and the cord could stand to be a bit longer, but there is no doubt this is a good value."
4,ok,worked great when we first got it but lost its sharpness quickly. I expected more but it'll do for now
3,not quite what I was looking for,"The trimmer cuts hair pretty easily, but it's a lot bulkier than I imagined, and it doesn't give a extremely close shave."
4,nothing like hot clippers!!!,"My boyfriend is a big fan of these clippers and this is the second pair I purchased from Amazon. The first he threw away but we will not get into that. He loves these clippers and it does not matter that after using them for some time they get HOT, because this is his third pair. I love how his face and hair line looks after he uses them. Whenever we visit family I make sure he packs them so he can line up my brothers."
5,NO MORE RAZOR BUMPS,"In the past i had issues with razor bumps anytime i used a razor on my face, and so i used magic powder which worked good for the most part, but would require that i buy a tin every two months or so- then i got a foil shaver for my birthday and that revolutionized the way i shaved with one one setback- the following morning i could not recognize myself because of how many razor bumps i had. my barber then suggested that i used the t-outliner, and i have not regretted it since.ProsClose enough shave, with minimal stubsEasy to useEasy on the faceEasily adjustable for closer shaveConsGets hot- but i am not a barber, so i dont have to use it for extended periods- this doesnt bother me that much.This shaver has fulfilled the requirements for which it was bought- its gives me a close enough shave and is easy on the face as well."
2,I would give this cd away but my mama won't let me!,"This cd is garbage with recycled songs such as ""Southside"" by Lil Keke, The late Fat Pat song, ""Top Drops"" and South Parks Mexican's ""Merry Go Round"". Those songs are tight but they are played out and how many mixed cds have those songs on them. The answer to my question is a lot. And the rest of the songs on the cd are from wack Houston cats. It is so funny that I think my grandma can be on the cd and she is 72 years old. Just because you are from Houston and got gold teeth doesn't mean you can rap so all yall Houston cats besides Chamillionaire, Slim Thug, and Lil Keke need to put down the mic."
4,PATTI IS SUPREME AS USUAL!!!,AS most of us well know Patti Austin is one of the most underrated singers in the entire music world!!! Which is a pathetic but expected shame!! NOW....this album is again classic and Patti's ability to take ANY kind of mediocre song and turn it into sheer magic is clearly on display here! WELL worth the purchase she is one of the absolute best in any and every genre! This cd displays that. Can't wait til she makes another pop/r&b/dance cd which her talents tend to burn quite bright!!!!
3,freestyling and profiling sounds,The music that was heard was one of a kind. the beats were quite unique but still slaming if you get the picture dog.
4,Great crunchy Gothe Pop rock,"Just discovered these guys the other day at Rasputin's. If you're looking for a big, heavy, guitar/synth oriented band, female & male vocals, give this Italian band a try. Definately an interesting Progressive Metal offering.I was first attracted to the strength Christina's vocals on 'Unspoken'. At first I thought Madonna had come back to life, but it was really much too interesting to be her anymore. I just sat in the store, bought a copy, and have been listening for the last few days.The band's music is nice and good, if sometimes a little cliched, but nothing to be put off by. 'Entwined' uses many standard guitar tricks, all to the songs betterment. The title tune 'Comalies' is sung mostly in Italian which I dug.Cheers!"
5,Awesome!!!,"take my word-this cd is amazing. it has seldom left my cd player since i bought it. also, consider getting the 2 disc edition. it has beautiful acoustic versions. Lacuna Coil kicks Evanescence's ass. I don't think they're even all that similar, but since people seem to be comparing the two, i'm stating my opinion."
3,"Weak verse, strong chorus",Skirts a mediocrity so many similar acts evoke by accentuating the vocals to aid occasionally powerful gestures.
3,okay but overrated,"Let me start off saying that this album is very overrated. After hearing all of those 5 or 4 star reviews i decided to get this and i was excpecting the best. It wasn't. Yeah, there are some really good songs on here, but that's about it. Cristina and Andrea both have really pretty but haunting voices. You should check out nightwish. Nightwish is WAY heavier and WAY better than this. If you're a newcomer to gothic rock/metal you should get this. But other than that don't bother."
3,Decent CD - Not a Substitute for Evanescence,"I liked this CD pretty well. I bought it on a whim because I kept hearing how comparable they are to Evanescence. I am a huge Evanescence fan, so I thought what the heck, I need something to hold me over until their new album. The songs are decent, but the lyrics seem to lack the maturity and profoundness of Evanescence's."
5,"Very cool, just like A.D.D. from Chicago",I really like the CD a lot......there's a band from here in Chicago called A.D.D. that are very similar except that the female sings 100%. Kicking tunes too !! Check them out at www.addarmy.com
1,A Colossal Waste of Money,"Maybe I've been listening to too much Nightwish. But after carefully listening to Lacuna Coil's Comalies a few times, I still didn't like it! I found the melodies repetitive and the lyrics meaningless.Yet it was the singing which disappointed me most. While not as bad as some other reviewers suggested, it was still worse than I had expected. Christina Scabbia may very well be a ""good"" (or even a ""great"") singer but I didn't hear it here.Her voice did not ""stand out"" in any way for me like Tarja Turunen's or even Mariah Carey's!Too bad my online speakers aren't working. Otherwise, I could've saved myself some money!"
3,Dont see it.,"Everyone seems to think this album is a LC masterpiece and thats it's completely amazing. I definitely don't see it. Every LC album that comes out sounds the same, whether in comparison to their previous CD or when dealing with just a single album's songs themselves. Cristina's voice isn't that great and it doesn't vary whatsoever. The songs just don't give me that ""Wow"" feeling at all...this is nothing more than an album to pass the time. Nothing special."
2,OMFG...this music is crap!,"For some reason, I've heard that Lacuna Coil is similar the band Evanescence. And I've even heard that the female singer for Lacuna Coil has a better voice than Evanescence's Amy Lee. Out of curiousity, I decided to buy this CD and listen to it. I listened thouroughly through each and every single song. And guess what? It was an absoulte waste of my time and money. The male singer's voice sounds like it's dying in excruciating pain. However, the female singer sounded ok. But I must say that her voice sounds very typical and ordinary, unlike Amy Lee who has an amazing and unique voice.I don't understand why people would like Lacuna Coil over Evanescence. Evanescence is obviously A LOT MORE BETTER (not to mention a lot more succesful). But your opinion is your opinon."
1,Plegh!,"Hmm...How boring does it get. Well if you put a track on repeat you probably wont notice when it starts or finishes as there are no defining moments on this entire cd. Cristina is slighlty flat but brilliant compared to the male singer. Listen guys, sing in your own language! When rammstein sing in german they sound great, in english? Well try not to laugh. Itallian is such a sexy language, it would be 10 times better in Italian. I speak from experiance. I live in spain and when my freinds sing in english, no matter how good they are in spanish, it sounds bad, if the pronounciation is slightly off or if they are struggeling and concentrating too much, which leads to sounding robotic. This is the problem here. Chow!"
3,Well...3 stars actually,"Don't get me wrong, 3? stars is a good rating seeing as there are only 5 possible stars. Before I say anything else, can people just stop putting Evanescence in Lacuna Coil reviews. They have nothing to do with whether Lacuna are good or bad. Secondly, Nighwish is my favourite band, do NOT bag them just to say that you like Lacuna Coil. Who cares if they are goth or not...they sound amazing. Onto Lacuna Coil. If you ever get a Lacuna Coil CD, this is the one you should get. I gave it 3 because all their songs generally sound the same. I was listening to it and 20 minutes into the album I couldn't really tell if it had changed song yet. This isn't to say that this is a horible album. Heaven's a Lie is a great song...they just need to expand their song style. However, for such a talented band, that shouldn't be a problem. They are, after all, a fairly new band."
2,GET RID OF THE MALE VOCALIST!!,"This band has some good music, but the male vocalist has simply got to go. He contributes absolutely nothing to this album (except making my head hurt) and ruins almost every song on the disc. And after you get rid of him, turn up the volume for the female vocalist! If you just had her singing, even though she doesn't appear to have the vocal range of Amy Lee (Evanescence), at least LC's music is much less Top 40-ish and the guitar work is better. Without the male vocalist, this band could be much, much better."
4,Her voice-amazing!,"I was listening to the sample music and was amazed by the woman's voice. I like their style, which reminds me of Evanescence, which is my favorite band. I think if I hear the full song of Daylight Dancer I will buy it. The only thing I didn't like was the repetitive chords."
2,Boring!,"I found Lacuna Coil's ""Comalies"" to be bland, generic, uncreative, and most of all - boring. I'll agre that Cristina has a decent enough voice, but the band regulates her towards the eye candy role; she should sing more and they should dump that use twit that thinks he can sing. Never showing a hint of creativeness or agressiveness, this CD is pure generic ""goth"" rock that is depressing, and not in the sense that the lyrics and music are conveying a sense of depression. It is truely depressing to listen to for it's lack of creativeness and expression. Recommend for the MTV cum faux goth wrist slitting crowd that is so 'depressed' because their lives 'suck' so much. Yeah, whatever."
5,a must-buy,"this is an awesome cd. the male and female vocals intertwine perfectly. I can honestly say there's no horrible tracks on here; one or two seem a big long in parts, but that's it. ""Angel's Punishment"" and ""Heaven's A Lie"" are my two favourite songs, but the rest are pretty awesome too. they are able to blend melody and heaviness in a way that's so catchy. what else is there to say? it's an awesome band, and I'm glad to hear they're Italian too!"
2,Female vocals drowned out by bad mix,"I had high hopes for this album, but the mix is not very good. The female vocals often come out as vague vowel sounds and the male vocals are lackluster. The songs have simple setups and melodies and are uninventive. The only song which shows promise is ""Aeon"" and they chop that one short. Sorry, this band is mediocre."
3,Sigh....1986 style music,"It's hard to tell the age of the average reviewer who discovers Lacuna Coil. It DOES seem that people forget that the mid to late 80's were FILLED with bands that had this same sound. Not that Lacuna Coil is BAD, it's quite good! But what is somewhat boring is that there is nothing new in their band's ""sound""."
1,"Awful...Wanted to like it, but couldn't...","I listened to various snippets of songs from 2 Lacuna Coil albums on Amazon (this one plus ""Unleashed Memories""), and was initially blown away by Cristina Scabbia and the musicality of this band. However, after receiving the actual CD's, I was grossly disappointed...The male singer absolutely, unequivocally ruins every song he joins in on (which is 90% of the time). This in turn just makes the music seem clown-like, pathetic and campy at best. Very sad - I really wanted to like this band. They should eject the male singer and let Scabbia take the lead entirely to herself. Pathetic...Just wish I'd known this before I wasted my cash on not one, but two of their CD's."
4,Yes.,"Lacuna Coil's third full-length disc will not disappoint fans of the group's stately goth pop; led by the excellent tag-team vocals of Cristina Scabbia and (male vocalist) Andrea Ferro, the Italian sextet continues to produce top-notch atmospheric rock that defies easy categorization. Although there are occasional lapses into conservative craftsmanship (""Self Deception"") and trite lyrics, there are also some nice experimental touches, like the attention-grabbing start/stop digital editing in ""Aeon."""
3,A phenominal voice,"The italian six-piece offer their thirdfull length album.This marvelousachievement of beauty-and-beast goth metalsensuality offer's 13 original track's.Sure to please every Lacuna Coil fanand sure to please all the new comer's.When I first heard the song""Heaven's a lie""I was amazed by the lead vocal's.AlthoughI only heard that 1 song and I said to my self""Wow,I gotta see this band live!!""I have not seen them yet but I heard theyput on a phenominal show.A must own album for every fan."
3,"""Heaven's A Lie""","This is a good effort for Lacuna Coil, but it's my least favorite. I like some songs like ""Entwined"", ""Heaven's A Lie"", & ""Self Deception"" but this disc isn't the Lacuna Coil I love and know. I'm glad that they had a song on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball compilation because we need to listen to a good group like this. I wish Lacuna Coil would get more recognition than Evanescence cause they can't hold a candle to Coil. This is a good place to start if you're just getting to know the band, but as I say, this is only my opnion so the final decision is up to you."
4,Okay. . .,"Okay, sure, this is a good cd, but why are you all dissing Evanescence and comparing Lacuna Coil and Evanescence!? Can't they both have talented lead singers? Can't they both have good material?Lacuna Coil has been around longer, but Evanesence is no spinoff. Lacuna's earlier material isn't as good as the more recent songs/albums, so let's leave the whole time thing alone?Both Amy Lee and Cristina have beautiful voices, and I think they're equally good. They should team up. Kick goth-rock ass.Lacuna's ""Comalies"" is a very good album but it doesn't live up to the heavy metal goth rock that I've heard many people associate with Lacuna Coil. It's actually pretty slow paced, and softer compared to other groups who sing in the ""Goth-Rock"" genre (or ""Metal"" if you prefer.)80/100"
5,MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!!,This album is perfect every song is perfect.Get This truly a masterpiece for any rock or metal fan.
4,Join the Spiral,"The Italian band Lacuna Coil (meaning Empty Spiral) is one of those missed musical gems. For those who miss the old Progressive Rock and are tired of brainless metal, check out this band. Their tracks ""Swamped"" and ""Heaven's A Lie"" will give you an excellent sense of what they have to offer."
5,Great album!,"First off i would like to say that i like this band more then evanescence and i love evanescence. Cristina Scabbia's voice is eretheral and angelic with a dark edge to it. I have to say that my absolute favorite song is comalies. The italian in it gives it a exotic quality that i like. It makes me sad, happy,and passionate. When i listen to the begining of comalies, i feel a little like crying for some reason. Overall great album. I do recommend it 100% to anyone!"
5,Evanescence WHO?,Lacuna Coil is one of the most beautiful melodramatic bands I have heard. I don't see the comparison between Lacuna Coil and Evanescence. Lacuna Coil sounds different and by-far better. They have something called talent. Cristina Scabbia has wonderful vocals and they are awesome to be seen live. Listen to Lost Lullaby and Stars if you think they aren't good. Evanescence is one-hit-wonder pop rock and has nothing on Lacuna Coil.
3,Not what they used to be,"This album is okay, but they are not what they once were. This album barely deserves 3 stars. I only gave it that because it has a few good songs. I love Lacuna Coil, they are one of my favorite bands, and i hate to see this happen. Their first two CD's, Lacuna Coil EP and In A Reverie, are AMAZING CD's, but this is NOT. Lacuna Coil used to play original,beautiful,exotic and amazing gothic rock music. I had never heard of a band that played that kind of music. But now, they are doing what every other metal band is doing. Lacuna Coil just lost their originality. It's too bad. Lacuna coil had everything, but, sadly, lost it all."
5,Goth?,"Why is this classified as gothic? I used to think so too, when I was new to the genre. Gothic is like, Tristania, Sirenia, Theatre of Tragedy... This is atmospheric metal. What is gothic about this? There are no choirs, classical influences, unclean vocals, and it's not very dark. Of course I do like this album but I do not understand...And while I'm at it...Nightwish isn't gothic either. It's female-fronted power metal.and also, what is wrong with Evanescence? I broke away from the mainstream, I know real bands now, and I still like evanescence. Of course they arent as good as what the foriegn metal scence has to offer, but they are quite superb for mainstream."
5,BUY THIS CD!!!!,Anyone who thinks that evanesence is a decent band NEEDS to buy this cd!!! This cd is countless times better evanesence!!! Lacuna Coil is amazing and I listen to them constantly!!!! Everyone needs this in their music collection!!!
3,"3,5 stars","I generally like very much atmospheric metal. Well in this album we have also female vocals (which are very sutable and good). They remind me The Gathering (Though i believe The Gathering is much better than them). Anyway, its a good album, not to go crazy for but an album betwwen its just ok and i like it. FRom what i have been told this is the most commercial album they have ever released. Well its sound a little bit more approapiate to the every day fans. If you like atmospheric metal then you will like this album. But its not as good as their first Ep which i believe it is their best work."
1,This band actualy got signed by a label?,To each his own but i can't see how a person can listen to these songs or clips of song and then buy this cd. No wonder people are switching from alternative rock to hip-hop. This band has nothing special just an efensence spin off.
3,Not for everyone,I like this cd...there's like 4 or 5 songs that I like on it.I don't know if everyone will like it though. it came out in 1995. soo it's gonna sounf a lil different but it does sound way good for that year and it's still doing good to my ear now..but the choice is yours.. the choir is pretty strong...they got that wild ricky dilliard thing going on...aight peace out.
4,Hard Knocks and Cowboy Logic,"A story about working cowboys (could be anytime in the 50's and 60's) that held their own council in the face of movie stereotypes and owners with ""more money than brains""."
4,Classic 80's comedy,My favorite Billy Crystal movie. If you liked the Beverley Hills Cop movies you should like this.
3,Fun!,"Forget originality, unpredictability, or logic. Sit back, relax and enjoy a very funny, action-packed comedy with undeniable chemistry between Crystal and Hines. This is what 48 HRS. wanted to be!"
3,Sweet Freedom,"It's a pleasure to see this movie again and again. Good scenario,intelligent jokes, Gregory Hines and Billy Cristal brilliants, last but not least the good music of Michael McDonald."
5,One of our favorite movies!,"Brilliant writing brings together two actors who would NEVER be considered ""classic cops,"" Some of the lines in the movie are still used by our family on a regular basis. That kind of staying power says it all - definitely worth a watch!"
4,Marvelous !,"This movie was released a year earlier than the first Lethal Weapon. Too bad no interest of making a sequel as Running Scared is fun buddy-cop movie and the pairing of Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines is fun. The lovely Darlene Fluegel is the love interest. The plot is standard cop movie nothing new or original just sit back and enjoy this fun movie. The DVD is OK nowhere near a demonstration quality but certainly better than my WS LD. I would have given it five stars if only there is a 5.1 Dolby Digital and English subtitling option. But for the price, it is highly recommended DVD for both action and comedy fans as this is every bit as good as any of the Lethal Weapon series."
5,a lost jewel,"There are quilty pleasures{Road House} and those movies that are so bad that they become good{Show Girls} HOWEVER this not one of those. It is one of those jewels that doesn't show up much on tv and got lost in theaters. The teaming of Hines and Crystal is a once in life time thing and sorry to say it turned out to be just that. The comedy flows and is not forced. The leads make you like them and you belive that they are real cops. The chase on the El tracks is great and the building shoot out at the end is well done. Hines has a nice turn when he ""arrests"" another man's lover for his own. The montage at Key West is nice. But the sound track is 70's gold and realy moves the movie forward. This movie holds up well. It's really was a shame that the sequel was never made. Maybe that was a good thing because the sequel could never live up to the original. Look for this movie and enjoy!"
4,One of the best buddy-cop films made.,"This really is an underrated classic. Hines and Crystal are superb and their chemistry made me wonder why they never appeared together after this. The script is loaded with excellent comedy touches, but the film also satisfies in the action department. Superb."
3,When we were twenty years younger....,"""Running Scared"" is the typical cop buddy of the era, so common in the decade of Ronald Reagan. Billy Crystal and the late Gregory Hines share some amusing moments but the film can't seem to decide if it's an all-out comedy or a cop drama parody. In an early career role, Jimmy Smits plays the seedy drug kingpin that the two cops are trying to bring down.The period music and fashion make this one a film for those waxing nostalgic, needing a reminder of why ""we love the 80's""."
5,Mix with 5 oz of 2% milk and 12 to 16 oz of Ice - Slap yo mamma good !!!,"I really enjoy the flavor of this product. I found it at a shop in Myrtle Beach and brought it home with really not much thought it would be anything special. $1.99 a pack, I purchased 4 of them. Mocha and the Vanilla. WOW OH WOW. As far as a powder mix this is great. I mix a little starbucks via instant coffee in it and it taste just like the way over priced Frappe they sell. The pice on here is a saver too."
3,Expresso flavor is stronger.,This flavor is good but the caffeine is weak. Try Big Train Expresso it has more caffeine.
3,Too Much too soon,"Not believable. A gorgeous, handsome millionare can have almost any girl he wants and he is used to being around pretty ladies, so why would an experienced man have no hormonal self control towards a woman who wants to harm his ""family""? At least be cold and aloof in the beginning; then warm up later. Brenda is still one of my favorite writers, I have lots of books by her. However, considering everything, the guy should have been meaner."
5,"Yes, it was a scandal...","This book was good. I've read many books from this author, and she's always leaving you where you're looking for more. Anxiously waiting to read your next book."
4,Nice,Another wonderful read by Brenda J.This story takes a lot of twists and turns. There are enough there to keep your interest.
5,A Scandal Indeed!!!I,"I love all of Brenda Jackson's books. They are writen a little too short for my taste but the storylines are very exciting. It's never a dull moment within the pages. I really don't have any gripes about digital downloads because either theyre going to download or not. However, the book was an ok read. It started a little too slow for me. The good thing about ordering digital books from Kindle is that you can download it to numerous of equipment. Not only that the downlaods are instant once you click ""pay""."
4,cute quick read,"Story of Wesley, a young millionaire that is extremely loyal to his adopted family. He won't let anything or anyone hurt them - even a persistent reporter. But what happens when he finds himself falling for the very newspaper reporter, Jasmine, who is determined to get the dirt on his family? It's a cute quick read."
4,Always Great Work by a Great Author,"I usually don't read harlequin books, but since there were books by Ms. Brenda Jackson I had to sneak by my friends and head to the harlequin aisle and pick up this book by Brenda Jackson. I must say that the book was well written and I enjoyed it even though it was short. I wanted more of the story. I just enjoy all Ms. Jacksons book and would tell anyone to pick this and her other Harlequin books up even if you don't read them because this is still Brenda Jackson at her best, which is writing good books."
1,Scandal Between The Sheets,"I never recieved this book, it was probaly lost in the mail. Please check into this, the visa card was charged for this book.pbf"
4,Good Book,"This is a great book for coahes, counselors, and therapists working with individuals that are grieving or dealing with past issues. I found the book to be helpful in explaining why so many of the people I coach seem to have denied or repressed very emotionally traumatic incidents. The human mind is amazing and complex. This book helps unmask some of that complexity.My one criticism of the book is that it is difficult to read at times. The tone is a bit academic and challenging to read. If you can wade through some of the language it is definately worth reading."
4,Very informative book!,"Vital Lies, Simples Truths by Daniel Goleman is an excellent, well-written book that provides plenty of good examples to explain how humans deceive themselves. It flows and is relatively easy reading. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the psychology of human beings."
4,"Justified for its cost, don't compare to high end receivers","If you are looking for a reasonable home theatre, that performs for the price you pay, then this might be the one for you. I hooked it up to my 51""TV in a 14x12 room and it fills up the room with decent effects. Quality wires DID make a difference, I used cheap co-ax in the beginning and later upgraded to BetterCables and the sound effect were pretty good. In my opinion, use a 14 gauge wire to connect the speakers. Few cons are that- it has only 2 digi inputs (1 opt 1 coax)- to fill the room with sound and effects, I have to keep the volume at level 40, which I think that is about 80% of the max volumeOverall value for money and you can slowly upgrade it (speaker by speaker)."
3,Stain blaster,"I had a number of items that had stains, from tanks, to stuffed animals, to tablecloths - all ready for the garbage due to stains....and yet I could never seem to throw them out thinking someday I'd find a way to erase the stains. Theh I heard about RIT. I couldn't find it in any store, but found it on Amazon. The price is a little high for the oz capacity, but figured it was worth it. In using it, I've found that it works better than most removers - it completely removed long set-in stains from some shirts, and most of the ones on the stuffed rabbit, but others it didnt work - soooo I guess maybe it depends on the material, how long it's set and what type of stain. But overall, I'd say it's a good product.However, what wasn't good, was that it arrived 3/4 empty, having not been packaged well, it leaked into the envelope and plastic. Then I had to hassle with returning it for another."
4,Dope Hip-Hop from tha Boot,"This title is out of print, and is EXTREMELY rare and difficult to find, if you ever find it. It has some nice, spacey beats, via the dope keys (which sound very reminiscent of the Korg Triton LE's soundbank). My cousin used to f*** with KP with the rhymes (they used to work together), and he's a friend of the family. Really, really good stuff. If you have the money to dish out or the heart to go ""CD huntin',"" this is a great buy. Hey, like I always say with rare albums: you'll be the envy of all your homeboys and homegirls, too! PEACE!"
5,it jam,the album jam but the group broke up.so sic is not a stable record label.all the members are doing their own thang.
5,Excellent album from Norwegian singer-songwriter!,"Thomas Dybdahl is a classical singer-songwriter, and this is his premiere album. Best song is is the album opener ""From Grace"", closely followed by ""John Wayne"" which really shows Dybdahl's great voice.If you like John Mayer and Ryan Adams, then you'll like Thomas Dybdahl. Start with this CD, then try Stray Dogs, his debut album.I recommend this CD very much!"
4,Singapore by panorama,"THIS DVD COVERS MOST OF THR POPULAR ATTRACTIONS IN SINGAPORE. THE PRESENTER HAS A NICE APPROACH, AND THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS FIRST CLASS. IF YOU ARE PLANNING A TRIP TO SINGAPORE THEN THIS DVD WILL HAVE YOU WELL INFORMED."
5,This has to be the best band,Hilarious. Period. Its Punk but instead of being used as a way of showing anarchy a way of showing Fun. Dickies created the fast fun pop-punk that we now know as the...warped tour main stage bands... None of those bands could live up to the predessors.
4,More for the Masses,hey y'all if you havent heard then you need to hear this is an outstanding mix tape of some of the Freshest East and west coast underground and over ground talent..whether it BE in front of the Mic or Behind it on the 1 and 2's this is a phat album ..and the man M Boggie did it up in stlye..Pick this up if you want a real treat in your hip hop meal..and please..get rid of that junk like JAY-Z and DMX..MAsa P..etc..bad for your health..Peace
2,A little lacking,"I bought this book while in the brainstorming phase of my outdoor kitchen. Incidentally it's STILL in that phase, and this book did not advance my cause at all. It had good reviews and I was hoping it would have good ideas and planning tools. Instead, it seems to focus on only a handful of actual kitchens, and doesn't really cover much ground. It does not have any recommendations on building YOUR kitchen as far as usage of space, appliance placement, etc. There is ZERO cost information as well, so if you are hoping for help shaping your kitchen budget, this also is not the tool. It has some moderately useful technical information, but not nearly enough to let you build anything unless you already knew how, in which case...you wouldn't need the book. Basically, it's got some nice pictures of some pretty sweet kitchens that might give you an idea here and there; that's about it."
3,Outdoor Kitchens,"This is a good book. I gave it three starts because it only gave s few designs for the construction I needed, but it was a good reference. I think its important to research projects with these books then launch your own project with the ideas you've learned.3 stars out of 5."
1,It has so many errors that it isn't funny,"Beside the errors pointed out by last reviewer, I also found the following:1) A typo(?) on page 179. ""...but IP addresses can reach 256..."" should be ""...but IP addresses can reach 255...""2) The WHOLE chapter of Week 2 Day 11 (page 213 to page 232) has WRONG subnetted addresses. For example, in the table 11.3, subnet network of 135.55.4.0 should have host range from 135.55.4.1 to 135.55.7.254. NOT as in the book that the host range from 135.55.1.1 to 135.55.4.254.I have stopped reading this book since that chapter. It's a shame that this book still doesn't have an errata note yet."
1,If it didn't say Sony on the front...,"I definitely wouldn't know Sony made this. It's crap. I put it down on a table, it shuts it's self off, it refuses to play some regular (store bought) CDs (no scratches). It eats batteries. It's very, very loud when it does decide to play a CD. I am very disappointed. I was better off keep my 3 year old Pannasonic, it has better rumble control and plays all my CDs."
3,Dont be fooled by the display price!,"I have no complains for the product itself. Its a good player for the price.But if you think you are getting a good deal for this product, you are being taken for a ride. The registered price for this product is just $39.95 on the Sony Site."
2,Not pleased,"This was a cheaply made Sony CD walkman. The reception is not good. The programming of the radio stations was not easy.The quality of the item surprised me, being its a SONY."
3,Not as good as the originals,"The movie began with a preview for some devil movie which was definitely not appropriate for children. The movie as okay, not as good as the original ones, but I think my girls (aged 8 & 5) liked it. It would have been nice if the characters didn't use the word ""stupid"" so many times throughout the entire movie. The new voices for the characters is bothersome simply because I'm used to the originals."
3,For fans of Peanuts only,"Happiness is warm blanket, Charlie Brown has nothing to write home about. Released eleven years after Charles Schulz's death, it is loosely based on some of his comic strips. Albeit lacking the charm of many of his earlier specials, the movie has its moments, delivered mostly by Snoopy's pranks on Linus.The style of the movie is a throwback to the style of those earlier specials, but we the movie never really takes off to that level. There is even a Peanuts television series that has episodes that are stronger than this movie. It is hard to recommend this to anyone but to Peanuts fans only, since there are far more superior Peanuts material out there."
5,Wonderful dvd,I really loved this dvd. I have been a fan of Charlie Brown for sometime. This is one of my favorites. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Possibly the best Peanuts special ever!,"I've loved Peanuts in the comics and special for as long as I can remember, but the quality of the television specials has dropped over the years. I had low expectations for this, but was completely blown away. If you read the peanut comics as a kid, this brings the strips to life in a way that you probably imagined in your head. The tone is very true to the comics, animation is beautiful, and the story length is just right. Very nice extras as well. I recommend the blue ray to completely enjoy the superb artwork.Buy it so they'll make more like this!"
5,lots of fun to watch,This is a typical Charlie Brown Story...lots of fun to watch for the entire family. All young kids can relate to it.
5,Excellent!!!,"Just watched this DVD a few nights ago- and was blown away!! The style was at once classic but also slightly updated for today- with different camera angles and the like. Honestly, I probably sound crazy but often as I read the strips in the new collection of books that are coming out- I imagined a special really close to the style of this one. It is pretty sad though! But so happy with it!I just hope they continue to make more similar to this- with Peppermint Patty and Marcie too! The strips have sooo many story lines that would be great as specials, I think they have ample material to produce more classics like this. Love it!"
1,Mean Spirited and Dissapointing!,"I was excited for a new Peanuts special to watch with the family after turkey dinner. We were all pretty disappointed though. It seemed to be so mean spirited. Lucy was just over the top in tormenting Linus about him having to give up his blanket when their grandma finally arrived. Snoopy was also downright mean instead of playfully mischievous. The feel of the 60's was there but I didn't think it was necessary to keep the lines about calling each other ""idiots"" was still needed. I won't spoil the ending but it does sort of eventually redeem itself. The whole duration though was kinda ""meh"" and we felt the characters were mean instead of playful. We happily loaded up the Charlie Brown thanksgiving DVD afterwards and felt much better.I see there are a bunch of positive reviews here... but Rotten Tomatoes agrees with me. Out of 72 reviews it is currently rating only 62% of people liking it."
4,Cute little movie,"This movie is actually quite well done, and seems like it could have been made in the 70's, but was only made a few years ago. They did a good job with the animation, making it look vintage, and even the voices are pretty decent. Nice little heartwarming story that lets you know that it's okay to be different."
3,"cute, but scary movie trailer before Peanuts begins!","This is a cute little movie; very reminiscent of old-school Peanuts. My 2-yr-old daughter loves it (though I'm not crazy about all of the ""stupids"" that are always found in every Peanuts movie - we just make sure she knows that's a word that we don't say!). My only major gripe about this is the awful, dark, scary movie trailer that auto-plays when the DVD is inserted and is darn-near impossible to skip! Whose idea was it to put THAT movie preview on before a cartoon?"
2,Happiness is a Warm Blanket,I normally love everything relating to the Peanuts comic strip as well as the various animated productions that have been presented. This DVD was simply gross disappointment......RWS
4,The Comeback Guy,"The book is written by C.H. Frick. Softcover. 1961 by Hartcourt, Brace & World, Inc. 189 pages.The author's understanding of young people and of the things most important to them make the story remarkable read."
4,Few are aware the Twilight Language exists,"Excellent book. As I mention, few are even aware the twilight language exists,both in The East and the West in their respective esoteric traditions.Bucknell makes the possibly dry subject, come alive for readers with his wayof simplifying the definitions he asserts. From years of working with this language I can say that usually the definitions hazarded by un-trained academicians are lacking in a tangible touch with reality.Bucknell overcomes this, yet keeps the work easy to read and understand for the layman.Definitely a recommended book for any among the erudite, East or West."
3,"Useful outside of the ""Dark Ages"" setting?","I think a good source book is one which can be used by a storyteller regards of when/where your own story is set. While I could use of the information here for history or for lost artifacts, I was disappointed by the rather sketchy nature of the information in the book. It does give you good historical background and some more information on older clans. The mystically items have potential."
5,Great book. It helps me out all the time.,My freind has this book and I barowed it from him for a few days.It helps me all the time when I'm the story teller.
5,Good Tips,I'm trying to move toward living a greener lifestyle. This book has great ideas for using a natural product that is earth friendly and very cost efficient. Recommend for anyone trying to go green and cut back on household expenses. Also easy to read and entertaining!
5,It's worth buying.,The hygiene & grooming section alone justifies buying this book! I tried the tip on mixing a little bit of the baking soda in my shampoo to remove all the product build-up from my hair. Worked like a charm!
1,lacks substance,"No real insights here. Undeveloped, brief. Far from exhaustive. Essentially Lansky can take one use, for example: to clean stuff, and turn it into 100 just by listing different things to clean. 5 or 6 uses multiplied 100 times gets the book to their, but wasn't worth my money. Regret, we meet again. Sigh."
5,I enjoyed this one,"I was pleasantly surprised that there were so many uses for Baking Soda! My grandmother used it for many many things; but I was too young to care, I guess. I have been using it as a cleaning agent for a very long time; and now I use it more than ever."
3,too small,I like the book but I didn't know it was so small. You need to display the page count in the description of the books and the size.
3,And now for something completely different. . .,"Ctachy surf punk spiced up with spacey synth sounds, hip-hop beats, scratches and samples. Silly and offensive lyrics about sex, space aliens, religion, soccer, TV celibrities, JFK's murder, and more sex. After continuously touring North America, this infamous mexican band finally has a domestic release in the USA (actually, a selection from their first two Mexican albums `Demasiado Peluche' and `Un Domingo Familiar')."
2,More Aerobic than Anything,"This DVD was a great workout,shot in beautiful locations, but I was expecting a little more body sculpting in those specific areas(Abs,Buns,Thighs). It was 3 20 min.programs. 1 program had slight weights(circuit traing). The other 2 were hi/low aerobics.So I was disappointed in the naming of this workout. I feel it is definitely an aerobics based taped, not sculpting for your Abs-Buns&Thighs.I am going to try the pilates tape,because of the beautiful locations and I like Shelley & Jennifer."
1,NOT Abs & Thighs,This was a waste of money especially since I had already purchased the double pack of kickboxing and aerobics. It has two of the same workouts that are on the aerobics DVD. I purchased this because I thought it would be more sculpting and that would compliment the cardio workouts I purchased but that was not the case.
3,I was expecting more out of this,"This workout is mediocre. I haven't tried a lot of videos, but I was recommended this one. I have a hard time following the actions because the camera is focused on the womens' heads or showing the scenery. This would be better for someone more familiar with aerobics."
1,Glad I only paid $4.86 for this DVD,"The first time I put this workout DVD on, I expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs. What I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD. I kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs, but it never did! The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet. Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off. All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid. I turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy Blanks TaeBo on instead. MUCH BETTER!!!"
4,Great,"Good luck trying to put this down, Kennedy has a great insight into the specifics of the game. Great book for experts or just for starters, all can gain from reading."
2,Too difficult to use this huge box!,"Too difficult to use this huge box! Doesn't fit on the shelf easily, and awkward to use- tossed the box, and used Tupperware. We won't bother with this size again..."
2,Not worth the price,"My son was really excited to get costume...took several days to receive. As soon as my son put it on and I tried to zip it, it ripped and the zipper fell off. My son did not want me to send back because he waited so long to get it, so I just added some Velcro to the back and a safety pin. He still has fun playing in it but for the price it could have been made better"
2,This is embarassing...,"I received a sample of this product from Sephora. I like the darker fragrances, and I liked this one. Then I realized it was men's cologne. Whoopsies. But, it could easily pass for a woman's perfume as well! I liked the scent but it has poor staying power. I also wouldn't want my husband wearing something that smells like ladies' perfume. I'm just sayin'."
1,A sleeper,this movie is a gross and drawn out method of teaching boddly up keep. i didnt like it and im sorry i bought it. although Bill Muarry have been in better films ...I think he discredit him-self here. I dont think people want to spend thier money on a movie to tell them about the insides of thier bodies...
4,A good germ in the making.....,"Osmosis Jones is about a white germ, but bad at doing it. He is a loser to everyone, a slacker, he is a slacker/rapper, that teams up a 12 hour cold pill to kill a DEADLY virus! The 12 hour cold pill gets down and does the nose first, Frank, the guy the white germ lives in, is a slob, a 100% slob. To save Frank, the white germ kills the virus, and puts the body tarm. in the right place, so Frack is saved, but still he was almost a goner, the white blood cell his happy and respected, and Frank is doing exerizes. There are more stuff, like that there is a mayor inside Franks head, and more, but I told you the main stuff. I don't want to ruin everything for you. Drewing, is very good, they druw the characters well:8.5/10 Fun, there are some good parts and some bad parts, I would say there are more good parts:7/10 Movieplay, this is a good-sized movie:9/10 Overall, Osmosis Jones is very good:8.5/10"
4,Osmosis Jones: Great for When the Kids Get Sick,"Whenever our kids are sick we watch this film to spark discussion as to what is going on inside the body.As already stated here, if toilet humour upsets you, use caution with real young ones.The FishersDuke, Sharon, Bud(98) and Grif(00)"
4,My 5 year old liked it,"We like this show. My son is 5 years old and into bodily stuff like farting, snot, etc. He enjoyed the show and it gave us a good opportunity to talk about how the body works. This movie goes between real people and cartoon characters, which are germs, white blood cells, red blood cells. It's got action and comedy, which I believe are appropriate for young kids."
4,Kids love this movie,My kids love this movie and haven't seen it since it came out. They loved the ease of renting through Amazon.
5,Osmosis Jones Educational,Great fun movie for children and adults. Educational about germs and being healthy/clean.Watched this movie with a 3.5 yr old boy and he begged to see again and again.
3,O Jones,"Pretty cool little animated movie.Slightly educational, and fun for kids.It's even not too bad for adults.Good voice acting and the animation is decent.Not a blockbuster, but a fairly neat cartoon mov.3.5*"
4,bought for my students.,It's a good one. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new.
2,Eh...,"Well, personally, I thought it was pretty gross but maybe other people liked it. It wasn't funny. There were some kinda sad attempts at jokes that didn't work out, and all in all it was pretty much a gross walk-out movie."
3,Funny movie but not for younger kids,"I like that this movie provides a humorous but fairly accurate view of how the body's immune system works. It also has a great message about interdependence and taking responsibility. It has all the bodily humor you would expect - jokes about snot, vomit, farting, belching, etc. This is a Farrelly Brothers movie, after all. Adults should be aware that there are two instances of mild cursing (""this damn toe"") and one scene that shows alcohol consumption in front of the main character's teenage daughter."
2,Entertaining for kids,"As a Biology teacher I am always on the lookout for entertaining movies that allow me to bring real science into the classroom. Osmosis Jones has enough Human Biology to justify showing it, but I did not find it very interesting or factually relevant. Some students enjoyed it, but others were bored (the animation keeps it juvenile)."
3,OK.,"Osmosis Jones is a great movie for kids,I wouldn't tell older people to watch this movie.It's kind of weird seeing Chris Rock in a movie without him cursing,well there is no bad humor but there are some very sick parts considering it takes place in a body and it's about a white blood sell and a cold pill tring to save a body from a bad germ.It get's stupid and slow at some parts but it's a good movie all together.Recap!Good for kids bad for adults,slow but good.Kids,get it.Adults,don't bother."
3,Cute but gross,"THE REVIEW'S TITLE SAYS IT ALL: THE MOVIE IS CUTE BUTGROSS. I'VE RENTED THIS AT LEAST 20 TIMES ANDI STILL FEEL LIKE HURLING AT CERTAIN TIMES WHENI WATCH IT. JUST PLEASE,FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,DON'T WATCH THIS AND EAT."
3,amusing and somewhat informative,"this movie in a nutshell, compares the human body [that of frank-bill murray] to a mostly dysfunctional city. the unlikely hero, a misfit mostly screw-up cop/white blood cell, faces off against an undiagnosed evil invading disease.while mostly above the understanding of children, it is a relatively clean movie and is an entertaining mix of live action and animation. osmosis jones provides light amusement without trying to be something its not."
3,Osmosis Ewww,"Fun to watch, until Bill Murray comes on screen. Word to the squeamish...you might want to close your eyes during his scenes. But the animation is very well done, and the dialogue is very funny if you follow closely."
5,Excellent,"Osmosis Jones, a tale of physiology, an adventure of how the immune system works; and a beauty story about a father and his daughter, health and disease in a well done zoom-in-zoom-out between reality and animation.Parents can't miss!Children pay attention!"
1,Don't bother!,Make that ZERO stars--rude and base. The kids I was watching with asked me to stop it after the first 5 minutes. Not at all clever or funny. Don't bother!
4,good,peter farrelly's osmosis jones is one of the funniest movies of 2001. that has bill murray and chris rock.
4,Fun and educational,"Jumping between live action and animation, this movie is fun for kids and also explains a little about how the human body works.While folllowing a white blood cell (a cop named Osmosis Jones), and a cold pill he has been paired up with to help the human (Bill Murray) feel better as he gets what he feels is the cold. Later we find out a deadly virus is planning to take over.Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a fun movie, maybe with a few one liners geared towards slightly older kids. My 4yr old son loves this movie, and I think it helped him visualize what was happenning to me.I was diagnosed with Leukemia and I think he can relate the ""bad guys"" in the movie to the bad guys in me, and that I have ""good guys"" (and pills) in me fighting to save me."
4,enjoyable & educational,"We liked this movie, it was educational for my 11 year old and he also enjoyed it. I was hoping that it would expain a little more in detail some of the roles of the ""clean up crews""."
1,Z06 Aluminum Frame,The cost of the article is a sham! The article is a few paragraphs long and says less than many other articles. Save your money and get a Corvette brochure or go online to Corvette sights and get free information worth something!
4,Very informative,"This book, while overpriced for the condition and binding,was indeed very helpful in our quest for natural healthy food. A lot of good recipes as well as information on grains, fruits, vegetables and other ingredients."
4,"Easy listening, reminds me of a lounge singer",Patricia Kaas has a voice that can relax you like a glass of Merlot. She has a lot of energy but at the same time her voice comforts the listener. It is extremely interesting to hear her sing a duet with James Taylor.
5,Fantastic,"If I had to sell all my cd's and could keep only one, this would be my choice. She has an incredible voice and sings with such emotion. You will have a difficult time finding something better after you have this disc."
4,Get in on it,Beautifully driven fusion guitar is calibrated just tightly enough to make over-shot mistakes blend seamlessly into one consistently interesting offering.
1,Not The Movie,"Not sure why some people have written paragraphs worth of reviews here for this movie. This IS NOT the movie.Reiviews here should be of the product listed. In this case, the reviews here should be of this, which is actually an over view of the making of, and some behind-the-scenes footage of the actual movie.Like others have commented here, I was pretty disappointed as well when I added this to my watchlist, only to get home later in the evening (expecting to watch this with my kids) and find that this is NOT the movie."
2,Not as good as the first movie,"I think this movie was trying to be to much like the first one but it failed, they should have had a better plot than the one they used for this movie. The first Night at the Museum was really funny and Ben was very good, He is still good in this picture even with a bad script."
5,Movie,I love the first one and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian: World Premiere was also very funny.
1,Wrong DVD,The DVD to the first Night at the Museum was in the case instead of the Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian. Disappointing for my kids who were in love with the first movie and excited to see the second! Hoping Amazon fixes the mistake and sends the correct movie!
4,"Fun movie, not as good as the first","I always worry about follow up movies but we enjoyed the first one of these so when it went on sale I ordered it. I wasn't dissapointed really in the movie, but without spoiling it, the ending really could have been better. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this, the old charactors are back with some new ones to add to the mix. The premise of the new one is a bit crazy, but the kids will love it."
2,Boring and more of the same!,"I too, saw this film at the Smithsonian's IMAX theater last June. I thought it would be an ideal place to see a movie like this.The first movie was cute but this one was so boring, I had trouble staying awake.Good for the kids but forget it if you are an adult. The plot was terrible and the characters were not much better.Save your money on this one!"
1,Hollywood spent millions of dollars.......on this !,"This has to be the most INFANTILE movie of the year(Step Brothers scored that title last year). It blows my mind that Hollywood continues to churn out these incredibly stupid movies and pass them off as entertainment. I am able to engage a suspension of disbelief in order to be entertained, but I find movies like this, an insult to adult intelligence. In exchange for the current crude humour, we get dialogue that sounds like it was written by 2 12 year olds. And Hollywood wonders why the attendance levels keep nosediving. Kill the mindless sequels, the copycats, the endless stream of Adam Sandler/Ben Stiller/Will Ferral type ""comedies"" and start getting CREATIVE again. Enough already!"
1,Pitiful,What a waste of time and money. Hank Azaria should stick with voices on the Simpsons where he shines. His acting sucks. The dialogue was stilted and seemed to be pieced together. Nothing flowed. The only redeeming thing was Amy Adams had a great rear and really tight pants. Otherwise there was nothing to look forward to but the end. Don't waste your time as I did.
2,New DVD was not new - it was used,"Bought this DVD as a NEW one from DIRECT Liquidations. However, what I received was not new. It had been played since it did not start at the beginning. Don't like that I was promised a new one and got used instead. Would not recommend this seller."
3,Worth watching just for Amy Adams,"Not a bad little comedy, better than expected. This was the perfect airplane movie - nothing to upset my fellow passengers, and made the trip go by quicker. And I'm just becoming such a huge fan of Amy Adams - she's our new Rosalind Russell. They should remake 'His Girl Friday' just so she can star in it!"
1,"Night At the Museum, Battle Of The Smithsonian","Whoever said that LSD is not the drug of choice for Hollywood writers has never seen Night at the Museum, Battle of the Smithsonian. Nothing made sense, , ,nothing flowed, , ,I can't help but wonder if they spent both dollars of the budget."
1,NATM 2,WOrst sequel I have ever seen! Waht a waste of money! Amazon: Can I please have my money back?
5,Night at the Museum:Battle of the Smithsonian,I bought this as a gift and was very happy that I received it when it was expected and in good condition. I was happy I was able to find the 3 disk edition + the digital copy + DVD + Blue Ray....all what I wanted....and SO EASY!!!
1,Bait and Switch,Tried to take advantage of this on Amazon's so-called Black Friday week sale. Item was listed at $1.99 and I completed transaction in required time limit but item actually came up as $6.99. Shame on Amazon for dishonesty. I canceled entire order.
1,Can't even watch,"I have rented this twice from Netflix, and cannot even view the movie for more than 5 minutes. The disc freezes for several minutes, and then skips way ahead, making the movie basically unwatchable.I have a Sony medium-high end Blue-Ray player.This same issue also occurs with Chronicles of Riddick, which apparently has a bad master disc making it problematic to say the least."
1,Not a naturally funny movie,I can't laugh watching this movie. The first one is better.Sometimes seem like stupid jokes.
4,fine & dandy,"good movie, however the jargon didn't always match the character and ""amelia's"" pants were way too tight."
2,Mediocre,"We enjoyed the original Night at the Museum film much more than this sequel. The quality of the Blu-Ray is great, and technically, it's fine. The plot is fairly elementary, however, if you can call it a plot. And much of the writing is unsophisticated and somewhat contrived. Owen Wilson's part seemed like an afterthought. Not much spontaneity. I doubt we'll watch it again - it's a one time experience."
3,Night at the Museum:Battle of the Smithsonian.,"This is the sequel to Night Of the Museum, except Ben Stiller,Hank Azaria **sadly there was not enough scenes with Robin Williams in it.** The movie is somewhat funny, More for the kids, still okay to watch,but was expecting more."
2,Thought it would be a better movie.,"We loved the first Night at the Museum movie, so we did just go ahead and purchase the second one before even renting it first. While there are some very neat scenes and the story is good, the movie is one drawn out boring ""playful banter"" scene after another. Yawn! My kids lost interest and so did we. It could of been so good if they would of cut 90% of these scenes out as they were not necessary to the story. It also seemed to lack the truly clever dialog that the first movie had and at times the comedy seemed very forced. Cute movie to see once, but I don't recommend purchasing it."
2,The first one was better,"There are a few funny scenes in this film, but I thought the first one was a lot better. Ben Stiller looks like he is just going through the motions while the other actors do most of the work. He looks bored and tired in this second film. I was disappointed overall."
5,A better offering than the first!,"I laughed and laughed through this one. Not taking anything away from Ben Stiller because he is a funny guy, however, Hank Azarra (or however you spell his name) was just the BEST! Everytime he opened his mouth, I just couldn't help myself. Don't be afraid to give this sequel a try. It's quality storyline and cast will leave you wanting more."
1,NOT the movie,"downloaded this ""movie"" for my grand child only when we went to watch it, it turned out to be a commentary on the movie by the director. It really should have been noted as such on your site. If there is something I am doing or not doing wrong I would appreciate feedback from Amazon. I downloaded the movie, went to my video library & when I clicked on ""watch movie now"" all that was there was the commentary from director."
2,This is only a short film (NOT ACTUAL MOVIE!!!),i was under the impression that this was the entire movie and was only a short film about the movie
3,Light movie,This is a movie to just enjoy without any thought or looking at it too seriously. It's somewhat interesting at times.
3,Fine for the Kids,"This is a harmless enough movie and the Smithsonian settings are fun, but the story is nothing special. In fact, I couldn't tell you the story, and I've seen it all the way through, twice, once in the theater and once on the couch with my son just a couple of days ago. Honest, I was actually sitting watching, not just glancing up from some other activity once in a while. There was a lot chasing and special effects. Abraham Lincoln gets up out of his Memorial and walks around on the Mall. Something about a powerful tablet. Hank Azaria wears a tunic and other characters mistake it for a dress. Larry Daley learns a life lesson. Aside from Owen Wilson and a so-perky-it's-painful Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart, most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking as they play one-note characters. Kids will get a kick out of it. Adults might want to plug into their iPods or do some needlework. Very family-friendly."
3,Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,"This was an ""alright"" movie but not at good as the original Night at the Museum. It was a little more ""violent"" than I liked for my smaller grandchildren."
5,"For ""Museum"" Fans","If you liked the first one, this one won't dissapoint you. Same lively action, quick wit and surprising twists. My kids loved the first and have been waiting patiently for the sequel to come out on DVD so they can watch it 100 times... and they will. It's like a cult flick for them. Good use of my precious time."
3,A little bit low in quality,"Like the previous reviewer, I thought this was the movie. Unfortunately, it is just the footage and interviews from the premiere of the movie. I wouldn't mind that except the quality is very low. Good information about the movie if you enjoy the movie though."
5,Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,"Very fine/fun movie. Well-acted and directed. Entertaining and abit better in some ways than the first movie. More people and less animals in this one. Yes, I certainly would reccommend this movie to others."
3,Better than one would think,This movie is actually more entertaining than I would have thought. We watched it with my son and daughter in law and granddaughters aged 6 and 4...and we all enjoyed it. I can't help myself I love Amy Adams she brings a warmth and joy to so many roles.
4,Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,I enjoyed the first and saw the second to determine if I wanted to add it to my family movies. I was not disappointed.
4,Entertaining,Entertaining. Not as hilarious as the first one but I still liked it. Family appropriate.
4,Funny Stuff,Great movie. Probably better than the first. It was definitely not the usual half-hearted sequel you usually see. More action and twice the fun. Recommend viewing this movie.
4,Sequels can be good,This is one of the rare movies that the sequel is almost as good as the first. It was fun to watch.
4,Funny Enought To Watch More Than Once,I really enjoyed the first Night At The Museum amd looked forward to this sequel. The first is still my favorite.This one is good but not as good. Too much time spent leading up to the action and not enought with all the great characters that made the first movie.Still I bought it and will enjoy seeing it several times. I like comedy.
4,"Saw it in the theatre, just bought this and taking our first trip to D.C.!","We saw this movie in the theatre with our 5yr old daughter. If you over analyze the historial facts of each character in this movie, you may not like it, as the one star review below. But take the movie for it's child friendly humor and overall use of historical characters and it's a Great movie! We loved it and so much so, that we are taking our daughter to see the Smithsonian for ourselves. There we may learn more acurate historical facts but still have this fun movie to watch and remind us of our trip. Like this movie and especially for the pre-order price amazon is offering!"
1,I thought it was the movie.,This was just a featurette about the movie. although it was enjoyable I thought I had purchased the movie and I was disappointed.
2,Night of the Museum dvd,"There are way too many scratches on the back-I tried to cancel this order 10 minutes after I ordered it BUT apparently gohastings does NOT check their mail so it's buyer beware....on a positive note, I have done business with them in the past with no problems but THIS time, am extremely UNhappy with them!BTW-I also ordered Whip it dvd and it also has scratches on the back. I have yet to watch either movie but should they not play right, I will def sent them back to gohastings."
2,Not as great as the first one.,"I am a mother in my forties. My kids and I loved the first movie. I didn't like this one. They should of used all new characters. I loved the characters in the first movie, but by using all the same characters in the second movie is what made the sequel boring. It was the new characters that made the sequel somewhat interesting like the Einstein bobbleheads, Abraham Lincoln and Amelia Earhart. The woman who played Amelia Earhart did a great job! The villian in the movie was the stupidest character and pretty much helped ruin the movie. Very poor casting for that character! If you are trying to decide between the two movies to buy, go with the first."
3,All the funny parts,"All the funny parts were in the trailer--okay not all of them, but compared to the first movie, this one just doesn't have the story or action or comedy to make it great. My kids loved the first one, this one made them forget the series altogether."
5,Funny movie the first . . .,time you see it. But still a funny movie. All actors are good. I like Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart.
4,NAM:BOS,It is a nice family movie with a few interesting twists in the plot. There are many moments of redundant or stereotypical slapstick comedy that hold it back from being an innovative classic though.
4,Great movie...more action than the original,This was a sweet movie that was probably better than the first with all the people it used and all the action. The only problem was the cheesy enemies.
3,Night....,A good movie for entertaining the family. It isn't as good as the first movie but is good enough.
1,lousy,don't wast your time. there is nothing here worth watching. just a conglomeration of video bits. la la la la
1,THIS SUCKS,I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOVIE IT REALY SUCKS ITS HORRIBLE DONT GET IT ITS GARBAGE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!
1,Rip Off,I thought it was a free movie. Ended up being a trailer only 9 minutes. Did not know I was charged until the review your purchases email.
2,night at the museum battle of the smithsonian,I only have one problem with the digital copy. It doesn't let my download to my computer. Can this item be returned?
3,Night at the Museum 2,As most sequels go it wasnt as funny as the first one but it did have its moments. Hank Azaria was hilarious as he usually is and Robin Williams's cameo was too short.It was not the worst sequel and it wasnt the best I've seen but it was descent enough to watch. Kids that are into history will enjoy it. As far as family films go it was pretty good.
2,Night at the Museum II,"I was all excited that the DVD came so quickly, but after a few viewing I became disappointed. The DVD now pauses in certain area of the viewing. BUMMER!I will not buy anything from that dealer again."
3,Eh....It's a kid's movie,"Not the greatest as an adult to sit through, but my kids loved it. They watch it all the time. And of course, the price was right"
5,LED Light,"Great product, Handy size, gives out an amazing amount of light. Everybody that sees it wants one."
2,Low quality game by defunct company,"I had wanted this for a long time, based on the good quality of this company's other game, ""Silent Steel,"" and a plot that appeared compelling at first glance. The video quality, the internal consistency of the plot, and the acting are all very bad. Internet research indicates that many others also had a bad opinion of this game."
1,"I was tricked into buying this CD, I swear.","How can this be compared to Jurassic 5? The inscription on the inside cover reads something like ""This is a tribute to the people who invented Hip-Hop."" If that's what I wanted I would have gotten Kool Mo Dee. How can raising a tribute to the originators of Hip-Hop even be considered ""fresh""? Not innovative, repetative lyrics and weak, weak beats. Very uninpressed."
4,Give It A Chance,"This album is one of the most refreshingly different albums I have heard in a long time. It shows that there is more to hip hop than talking about the clichéd themes that are in so much rap heard today. Don't get me wrong I listen to all sorts of music from Stevie Wonder and N.E.R.D to Ben Folds/Five and The Pixies, so I'm not saying that other rap artists aren't good, U.D are just a funny intelligent alternative. Finally, to 'a music fan from Harlem' a Tribe Called Qwest's ""Low End Theory"" is not the greatest album of all time but it is one of the best. If you were a true music fan you would respect U.D and A.T.C.Q for daring to do something different even if you didn't like it. Their music is not an imitation they are just influenced by other artists that they respect. You can appreciate good music with out loving it."
3,They look better than they feel,The appearance of this item is very attractive but the fit is unlike other Clarks that I have purchased. They are tighter near the peep toe which makes the shoe uncomfortable. I have tried stretching them but without much luck. They are not what I expected comfortwise.
2,sizing,This shoe runs pretty small. I had to return my usual size in Clarks. Ordering on the internet sucks sometimes for that reason. You incurr shipping costs both ways.
1,Too bad!,"This shoe is not comfortable at all! See the cute black leather design running down the center? It is raised and rubs on the bottom of your foot. My feet are narrow, I normally purchase narrow width, I ordered this shoe in the normal width and it pinches my feet. I cannot even wear these shoes."
1,Not worth the money or time!,I bought 2 sets of these speakers because they would not last for more than a year. I don't listen to music that load but being in the garage I have to turn it up a bit (about half volume) to hear it outside. They do not like that. After the second set I bought Yamaha speakers and have had no problems at all and they sound much better.
3,Does exactly what it says on the tin!,"I`m pleased with it.Only criticism is that the wheel is exposed. Maybe they could have put some clear, thinner plastic over it.I took it on the beach and it got sand in the wheel, but other than that, I`m happy!"
3,Works when it stays together,"I use this product attached to a benchtop spindle sander's 2"" outlet to step UP to a 4"" dust collector hose. While it does work, what's not apparent from the description or the picture is that it's actually made in 2 pieces. In fact, I never noticed this myself until it came apart. Since it first happened, vibration periodically pops it apart again. Easily fixable with a little glue, but were it designed properly to begin with, it would never happen."
4,reducer for dust collector,Product was exactly as described!! I had to make a few adjustments but I knew that when I bought it. They don't make the exact size I needed so I compromised by adding a few end pieces to get what I needed.
3,What can I say?,"It's a piece of plastic, bigger on one side than the other. I just wish for my application it was 4"" ID and not 4""OD"
2,Eclectic Electronic Elevator,"Hmmm. It's all electronic renditions. The composer does a fairly good job imitiating real instruments from an electronic keyboard, but it's electronic never-the-less. This isn't a bad thing if that's your niche, but personally, I like true instruments and the rich, non-metallic sound they create. This is a personal choice for anyone here."
5,amazing book,"Igore Henry Miller's comparisons of himself to Arthur Rimbaud, and enjoy everything else about this wonderful, energetic, brilliant work. Miller's insights into Rimbaud's genius, and creative genius in general, are timeless."
3,A long and expensive blog entry,"I bought this book because I'm a Rimbaud fan. Somehow, H. Miller wrote like a blogger would talk in-depth about someone great. That's all. Then I lost the book. I did not even bother to look for it.I think this book is something you can show-off on your bookshelf but not really enjoy."
2,miller was no rimbaud,"henry miller, although an okay writer and admirable in his rebellion against false values, has no business comparing himself to someone like arthur rimbaud. the reviewers who think this is some kind of masterpiece are pretty gullible, and it seems that miller had a talent for two things:fooling people into thinking that he was something special, and using obscure and derivative ideas lifted from other writers to deceive the pseudo-intelligentsia into believing that he discovered something original in his mostly unremarkable and notoriety-seeking life. miller may have talked a lot about empathy with outcasts and misfits, but he seems less a person who actually felt different than others so much as an avid reader who decided that he liked the fashionable and avant garde self image of the outsider, and so adopted it. ultimately, for all his muddled, fragmentary talk, miller's philosophy of life can be summed up in two words:""who cares?"""
3,Saves your hands,"These are a little thinner than I had hoped. But, the last really heavy-duty pair I had cost a lot more, too! Used these most of the past winter for carrying wood and loading the fireplace insert. Looks like they'll last at least through next year, so they're adequate for my purpose. Unlike the web page, they are really a bright blue color!"
4,Well made!,"Well made, but a little too snug compared to others. A little longer would have been better. They also work well when you can't find your regular cloves for outside in the cold."
5,400 Welding gloves,I bought the gloves to weld on my vehicle and around the house.I weld with them for one day with no trouble.great glove feel great.I highly recommend.
2,Not as big as advertised!,"These gloves are very nice, but are only 13.25"" long. I was counting on using all 18"" that they promised. If I got burned 17"" up from my finger tip, would Amazon cover the hospital bill? But I digress"
5,Work Well,"I recently had a new woodburning stove inserted into my fireplace opening. I quickly found out that you needed protection whenever you load wood into it as the heat generated is terrific. I ordered these gloves to use and they work extremely well. I have actually picked up live embers with them and tossed them back into the stove. And since the gloves have the long cuffs, it protects your arm halfway up which also turns out to be important. They are a very bright blue color. For the price, they can't be beat."
5,Great pair of gloves,I am new to welding and checked the previous reviews about these gloves. All I know is during my practice welding session I was holding a piece of flat iron in my hands for quite some time and then set it down. I looked and noticed it was glowing red (I was not holding it at the red portion but just below it). I felt NO heat in my hand. These gloves are durable and protect your hands amazingly well.Pros:+ comfortable+ fits mid size to large hands well+ quality construction+ made in the USACons: (minor)- color comes off easily on the finger tips with alot of use.Overall these gloves are perfect for your welding jobs.Thanks for reading my review.
5,Best fireplace gloves,These are the perfect fireplace gloves! My husband loves them! They are really well made and I'm sure they will last for years.
5,Great BBQ Gloves,"I bought these glvoes to use when BBQing. I can pick up a hot grate and feel no heat. Just what I was looking for. These gloves are more of a royal blue, they are a different color than the picture provided."
2,Not good for high temp cooking,"I thought these would be good for bread baking (we use an iron skillet with lid in oven at 500 degrees). As soon as I grabbed the skillet with these gloves, the heat went straight through to my hands in seconds, and the glove's material smoked and charred.Anything over 450 degrees is too much for these things.These may be good for welding, but not for cooking."
5,Use'em for BBQ,"As all the other reviewers mention, these are awesome. I use'em for grilling/smoking and couldn't ask for them to be any better. I did try the redneck test and picked up a smoldering piece of burning hardwood charcoal to see how long you can hold it...note to self: don't do that, haha. So, short of grabbing smoldering hot pieces of flaming charcoal, these are awesome. Oh, and to anyone worrying about the color, if you use'em to BBQ, they won't stay electric blue for very long if you're using them right."
1,too big for me,These are not one size fits all. The tag on the inside says SIZE: L and they are way too big for me to use safely. The tag also says they are made in China. Very disappointed I have to return these.
3,not made in america,thought maybe it was made in america? U.S. forge! label on the inside reads made in china. should call it communist forge.
1,Waste of time,"This album sounds so much like Queensryche that I wonder why they even recorded it. If you read other comments you'll hear the Maiden/Ryche/Fates comparison many times, I totally agree. Why bother with imitations when you can always listen to the originals."
5,A GOOD DISC...,"This disc is on the Austrian label Neatwork, and features tracks not covered in the excellent French Cronological Classics series--which is now mostly discontinued.If you're at all interested in classic Jazz, you should snap up all these discs you can find.By the way, the Chronological Classics is distributed under the Melodie label."
2,Pass!,"Out of all the Olsen twins movies, this is one that you can really pass on. It has lost the ""cuteness"" of their earlier movies, and has a lack of any sort of plot that you see in their ""grown-up"" movies. They tried fitting in some humor, but it just doesn't fit. I thought the boys were terribly mis-cast. They could have at least cast boys who were actually French. The accents were terrible. If you want to see a couple of pre-teen girls see the sites of Paris, and jump on beds, then go ahead and see this. If you want to see a better MK+A movie, then see Our Lips are Sealed."
2,Mk&A and french boys,"This movie was good at first, then okay and then bad with me. Definatly MK&A's worst movie... they are so BRATTY in this film!!! They just talk, act and dress like total snobs in this one. And the french boys... I refer to them as the UGLY boys! They are so wierd and ugly!!! To think they were cute...!?!"
5,Passport To Paris,i thought that this was one of the best films i have ever seen aad trust me thats a lot! there is two really SEXY lads ETHAN PECK and BROCKER WAY.!! ethan is so fit i think everyone should see this film i have been to paris and the real french lads are fit so they did pretty well GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!
2,Oooops! Forgot to build in a story line!,"Let's assume you and your 13-year-old twin sister want a vacation to Paris, and you want a tax deduction for it, how would you do it? Simple! Make a movie while you're in Paris!! Although I truely admire the work of Mary-Kate and Ashley, I must say that this movie was a complete waste of their time - which they could better have spent making more serious movies. Two girls go to Paris, to girls meet two boys in Paris... end of story. That's it. There is no more story than that. I give it two stars, because there are two stars in the movie, it's just a shame that they ARE in this movie and not in any other they could have shot while they shot this one."
5,Wow! Hot boys and awesome girls! What stars!,"This movie was awesome! Not only were the Olsen twins good, but there was really really hot boys! It really showed you Paris too! I'd rate it a 6 stars! It was da bomb! Kewl movie, kewl actors and actresses! Buy it now from Amazon.com!"
2,it wasn't that good,"Look if you want a really good olsen twin movie get Winning London not Passport to Paris . I mean get to reality who in there right minds would let 2 13 year old girls on a plane by themselves to a country they hadn't even been 2. Another thing i mean what sought of idiot would you be 2 let 2 13 year old girls around Paris with 2 boys they hardly even know. At the beginning There in LA but all they do is go to the mall talk on the phone and go on Dates and have parties. I mean what happened to studying, Homework, going to the beach and going on the computer! This is not the kind of movie i expected from the Olsen Twins i thought at least one of them would have had some sence!And one more thing the boys were sooooooo not cute and there accent was ..."
1,"Great acting, but again, another plotless movie :(","Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are incredible actresses, we all know that. Nobody could argue that toddlers who will say their lines and be the hottest female actresses are not good. But this movie really has no plot. It's basically Mary-Kate and Ashley hanging out in Paris... going out with boys... It has great scenery of Paris, but not much else."
3,"Good in a bad way, or bad in a good way? by Elissa, 13","This movie kind of gave me mixed feelings. There were many good things and many bad things about the movie, and I will list a few of them:THE BAD!-Their parents decide that their daughters get a foreign vacation many people dream of because the daughters have no lives. (WTF?)-Melanie and Allyson(MK & A) acted like snots in this movie by always being obsessed with popularity, their looks, and boys, and also getting away with spit-takes and sneaking out.THE GOOD!-The music was very illustrative to the scenes it was in and added lots of emotion to certain parts.-In most of the movie, MK and A were very cute and fun. I loved the ending at the dance when the MK & A kiss the French boys at the dance, especially with the song they played, because I think that added a lot of feeling to the scene.Okay, so those are my reasons. 3 stars. Ain't too bad, since some of their other movies were better."
1,Passport to Boredom,"As someone who has followed the Olsen's work for many years, I must say that Passport to Paris made me weep. My tears were not of joy but were, rather, of mourning. Mourning for a bygone era to which I had nary a chance to say ""goodbye."" Goodbye to the sweet, sensitive protrayals of pre-pubescent siblings whose surpisingly complex characters were beautifully interwoven into simple and yet poignant storylines. Hello to a new breed of Olsen - an Olsen who would rather quickly coast through a predictable plot and grab her paycheck on the way out the door. When did this all get so commercial? Needless to say, Passport to Paris will not be the vehicle to bring the Olsen's their long-overdue Oscar nomination. But it is the perfect vehicle to expose Mary Kate and Ashley for what they've become: Sell-outs to corporate greed who put money ahead of their artistic values. Shame on the Olsens!"
4,Very Satisfied,"I watched this movie on a iPhone and really enjoyed it and are currently working on getting everything Olsen.This movie is the best thing ever.My favorite part would be when they ordered pizza.And then the butler dude was like""Who would order this!what is this!""A second part would be the jumpin on the bed and faking to be the chef dude"
5,Very good!!,"The DVD is in great condition as is the case, which is how they were decribed in their ad. When making purchases, I put my trust in the sellers description and other customers feedback. I haven't been disappointed yet and I hope I never will be!! Thank you!"
5,Finally!,"This product is the greatest thing ever!I really like it:Highlights-1.The bed jumping scene!LOL how they heard the Twinnies2.The food rejection scene.No!Nah!Nope!Totally Not!3.The ending were the grandfather went to where they lived and spent time with them4.Where the girls ran off and the showfer chased them around5.The giving of the passports,packing,and whoop,off to the car"
4,Tres jolies petites filles!,"Those two girls are so cute...the french boys are a little bit goofy but overall the movie is satisfying and a nice taste of MK&A. Good for anyone who already loves them or at least doesn't totally detest them. I don't know how you could but some people are just a little crazy. Paris is beautiful and the movie shows that, only the scene in Le Louvre is really stupid with the computer animation. Other than that it's completely satisfying, cute, entertaining and fun. Try it out!"
4,Amusing,"""Passport to Paris"" is a decent, high-end video release for older kids. Mary Kate and Ashley play twin seventh graders whose interests seem limited to boys and shopping malls. In order to broaden their outlook, their parents send them to Paris to spend a week with their grandfather, the U.S. ambassador. He is a strict gentleman who assigns the girls an itinerary of sights to see and a stiff chaperone named Jeremy, whom the girls delight in tormenting. Soon they manage to elude their chaperone and have fun on their own, zooming around Paris on mopeds to rock music with two dishy French boys. In the end the girls' carefree attitude manages to have a positive transformative effect on both their grandfather and Jeremy, as well as on members of the ambassador's household such as the snobby, stereotypical chef. Though somewhat formulaic and necessarily silly, this is an entertaining, feelgood film and is sure to please any fan of the Olsen twins."
4,Fairly good.,"This movie was a little bit more realastic than some of their more recent movies, they seem to have more energy in this movie, and they don't play ditzy blondes, if you are looking to see a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie and arn't sure which one, this is one of their better movies."
1,Not appropriate for children,"Have you noticed that Marykate and Ashley are like rolemodels for girls between the ages of 6 and 12?? Girls see them act a certain way in a movie and then will think its cool and then act like that trying to be cool. Well, in every movie Marykate and Ashley meet two boys and ALWAYS kiss them and in this movie there is a scene where they sneak out to be with their 2 french boys they just met! Do you want your daughter sneaking out?? I certainly hop not!"
1,Ahem... *GAG!*,"You're kidding, right? Mary-Kate and Ashley are ANNOYING as HE11!This movie is about two snobby, lazy, dumb, horny blondes that go to Paris to visit their grandfather. They think they're so kewl in this movie, (and all their movies!) they ditch the only person who'll unwillingly spend time with them for two French guys who don't speak english and don't look or sound at all french! PleaZZZZZ do not expose little kids to this garbage!"
1,These two need a good swat on the behind,"What a mistake. They were sarcastic, disobedient, and mean. They have no respect for anyone or anything. The adults in the movie enabled this bad behavior by indulging these brats, and even saying positive things about them at the end.What a terrible example to set for young girls. Don't buy or watch this if you are trying to raise nice kids."
3,"Cute idea, but a little boring.",I love the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movies but this movie disappointed me a little. The idea of the movie was very cute but at times it got a little boring. Even my friends asked to turn it off before the movie was over! All I can say it rent the movie before buying it because this is really an item that has multiple opinions.
2,THis MOvie was good at first but quickly got tired...,"Ok, so this movie was actually kinda good at first but then it started to make me sick the way the girls always have these ""hot"" guys going after them is kinda unrealistic.I mean who always no matter what country they are in has all these hot guys wanting them? unless they are something to be wanted, and lets face it the olsen twins will always be michelle tanner from full house i dont think if they posed nude they could shake that rep. I guess this movie is ok if your younger girls like 8-10 but the only reason i would watch it again would be to make fun of it with my friends and it would really be good for that too!"
1,Not worth the time,"Skip it even if it's free. The twins are kind of cute. That's all I can say good about this movie.It feels like it's all done in one afternoon. No real story, just a collection of short scenes. The girls act like in a school play. The rest of the actors are worse. We watched less than half of it. My 9 year old asked us to switch to whatever is on TV."
5,Passport to Paris is funny and has 2 really cute guys!,"I think Passport to Paris is by far one of the best movies of 1999.Brocker Way and Ethan Peck are SO adorable and have the cutest French accents (even though it's easy to tell they're not really from France!)Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are wonderful actresses, but I think that Brocker Way and Ethan Peck should get a little more attention for their roles as Jean and Michel because the movie would have no point without them.But the movie is still great!"
4,Great movie,This is a great movie! Both Olsen and non-Olsen fans will like this movie.I Recomend for ages 9-14.
2,Does Not Work on all DVD Players!,"This DVD did not work on my current dvd player, and when tried on my laptop, it changed the settings to European. Plus, it will only allow me to do that four times on Windows Media Player. I don't know if the manufacture does not make the dvd compatible to all types of drives, but I was not pleased when I figured this out."
5,"""Passport to Paris"" is cool!","This movie is great! I am a Mary-Kate and Ashley fan and I love their movies. This one was a good one! Ok, two twins Allison (Ashley Olsen) and Melanie (Mary-Kate)Porter are turning 13. Their mom thinks that ""their world is too small"", so she sends them to visit their grandfather, the U.S. Ambassador to France, in Paris, France. They go durning the week of spring break and they miss pool parties and their big ""spring fling"" dance. Their upset about it, but would rather go to Paris. They meet two French boys while touring Paris and befriend a French supermodel.Their grandfather is too busy to spend time with them, so he sends a complete airhead named Jeremy to be their tour guide. They ditch him more than once, but end up being his friend in the end. The scenery is great- Paris hasn't changed since they filmed their movie. Paris was a great place to shoot the movie and MK&A made Paris shine!"
5,Another HOT Pick-- and I Don't Mean MK&A OR the Movie...,"This is MK&A's second best movie. It's funny (""Ze American girls, zey say, 'bonjour, bonjour... o ma Godt!!'"") and MK&A actually do act pretty well... but Ethan Peck (the one with lighter hair and a thick accent) is SOOOOOOOOOOO cute... I lvoe him."
4,Great entertainment for young girls (3 - 10 ),My daughters (3 1/2 & 7 ) love this movie..they have watched it twice a day on some days. Some parts are a little off key but to them very funny. The olsen girls are a nice way to give girls a wonderul outlook on what you can do in the world today
3,Very cute.,"This movie was not the best because it didn't have much of a plotline. But since I'm 13 I can kind of relate to the issues the twins have. The movie was very cute and entertaining but if you can't relate to a 13 year old's perspective, don't waste your time!"
2,"beautifully boxed, pears dissapointing","I was hoping for big, juicy asian pears. I was very dissapointed. The packing was a beautiful decorated box that I use for other storage."
1,What?,"This card may work just fine but it is 2012, no one pays $150 for a 32mb AGP video card. I rate this 1 star out of 5 for horrible pricing. Keep looking on Amazon, you can find waaaay better video cards for even just $30, like this one: http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Express-Graphics-512-P3-1300-LR/dp/B004BQKQ8A/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1345552821&sr=8-5&keywords=agp+nvidia"
4,I watch at the gym,This is good enough to keep me occupied on the elliptical for an hour. I love that Josh Flagg- so cute.
4,"Long, fine hair, looks great!","I have long, fine hair, middle of my back and naturally frizzy. I bought this product after reading some other reviews from people who reported similar hair types. My stylist thought I was crazy for thinking this product would work and tried it out with me last time I was there (after I'd already ordered the product) and it was gross. It left my hair oily and bendy, very weird. But I used mine today to give it a second try with my own touch and it was great. I used some leave in conditioner and then just a little tiny bit of this was before drying with a diffuser and am very pleased with how it came out. I haven't tried it with blowing my hair out or heat styling it, but it works for what I bought it for and that is to hold the wave and reduce frizz. Very pleased."
5,Fabuous product,"Best wax on the market. Very soft hold. Prevents frizz, creates lovely texture. Wish I'd discovered it sooner."
3,Might not be best for extremely short hair,"I'm a guy with hair 1.5"" (3.5cm) and usually shorter, and I was looking for something to add a little shine and take away some frizz. Given that this product melts at body temperature, if it is applied to hair close to the scalp it tends to stay molten and waxy. Although I've rarely been satisfied with the look, I've been trying it off and on for quite some time, and I think I have a little better luck in the winter. We tend to have hot summers >98.6 (>37C) here in Dallas."
2,not fragrance free,"Not fragrance free, just as stated on the actual label. So don't believe the reviews that say that it is. It doesn't advertise itself as fragrance free, and it is not."
1,Seller Listed it as UNscented but it has Fragrance :(,"It was advertised as unscented, but when I got it and read the ingredients it listed FRAGRANCE. Anyone who is sensitive or allergic to fragrance do not buy this. I contacted the seller about this and requested that they fragrance to their list of ingredients on the product page. I had to return it for this reason, but I'm sure it is a good product otherwise."
4,cute,"This set is cute, durable and the kids like it. I recommend it and would buy it again. Looking forward to other graphics"
5,Opens a window into the past,"This is a brilliant novel which engages the reader fully. The plot twists and turns as if this were a work of fiction rather than a biography. The characters are vivid, unique and unforgettable ... and they were real people. Ms. Barbee Lee was a keen observer and her descriptions are fascinating. Most of all, I liked how she tells us interesting gossip about some of the powerful people involved in the Cripple Creek gold rush and then, explains how things turned out and why. Some of these explanations needed enough time to pass in order to be told. While reading this page-turner, I felt like I was watching the events unfold through a window. I have recommended it to friends just because it is a really good book. The fact that it is true and will give the reader more insight into the past and into Colorado's mining history is just a bonus."
5,"Interesting, entertaining, and well-written","This well written book gives you a good feel for what it was like living in Cripple Creek around the turn of the century. The stories are entertaining, and its history educates. A wonderful and unique book, with lots of enjoyable detail."
4,Cripple Creek Days,"I live in Colorado and read how the different gold and silver mining days were. This book takes you from aplace in the Rocky Mountains became a town, did it survive many did not. I was in Cripple Creek 10 weeks ago seeing all the places mentioned in the book. Some of the mines are still working and others you can tour"
3,the consummate songstress,"Although I love Twinkie's vocal ability and song-writing skills, this cd is not one of her best performances. I guess I'm still stuck on the vintage Clark Sister sound!"
5,Creatice Zen Vision case - PERFECT!,"This case fits perfectly on the Creative Zen Vision. Perfect to protect if dropped. Product is made to allow all plugs, cables to be used while in case. Excellent product"
4,Very Good Carry Case For ZEN Vision,"Recommended. Good quality materials and construction. Good access to the player controls and jacks, however in order to use the memory card slot, you must remove the player from the case. Edges of the case extend past the inserted edges of the player; I would expect that the edges of the case would first absorb any impact from a drop."
1,i've got decieved,i have bought this product to use it with zen vision w but as soon as i got it i found that it doesn't fit with it cause it only works with regular zen visionso i had to through it out and to go to creative web site to get another one that fits it .
1,Sticker on Cover unacceptable to collectors,Returning CD due to sticker affixed to info booklet. Please return and send one that doesn't have stickers affixed to info booklet. I am a collector and it ruins the value
2,Too little too sinister,Her late works are very dark. And I thought I would get more than 2 episodes. I was very disappointed. And I love the series.
4,I liked this episode,This was a good episode where Poirot is older looking. The early episodes I like better though. Would recommend it.
5,"Claudia Acuna takes ""Standards"" and makes them her own.","Forget what you heard about latin-hype. Also forget that Claudia is amazingly beautiful with a voice to match. Clear your mind and hear the voice of an angel. From the first track to the last, this album, made up of mostly standards, plays out like a soundtrack to a movie. Highlights of the album:-pianist Jason Lindner's arrangement of ""My Romance""-Avi Lebovich's trombone on ""Nowhere To Go"" (an original by Claudia)-""Volver a Diecisiete"" the string quartet is amazing here.-Luisito Quintero on percussion on various songs, most notably is the timbale solo on ""Nature Boy""-Jeff Watts and Dave Holland!This isn't one of those albums where maybe two songs are good, you will fall in love with this music upon listening."
4,Glad I waited awhile before reviewing it,"This is an album that grows on you with repeated listenings. It has risen from a 2 to a 2.5 all the way to a (rounded upward) 4. After listenting to Diana Krall, Jane Monheit and especially the incredible Cheryl Bentyne I can say that Claudia is of a different style...and talent. It's not only that I prefer the ballads and sultry interpretations, it is that on this CD many songs are indistinguishable - same beat, similar melody, same rhythmic expression. Her range is not as great, her tone is not as poetic, nor is her diction as clear as many other ""jazz"" greats but she is powerful. The incredible ""I Fall In Lone Too Easily"" commands a 10 while the uniquely personal interpretation of ""More Than You Know"" makes a nice conclusion."
5,"Great song, awesome voice!","I love the song ""Unconditional"" and the second cut ""My Best Friend And Me"" is great as well. It has a rockin' coutry feel to it. It's awesome! Clay Davidson is an up and coming country artist with the potential to go straight to the top. I can't wait until the album is released next month. It includes a number of songs written by Clay who is an exceptional writer as well as a wonderful singer. Clay Davidson, remember the name, you will be hearing a lot of it in the future!"
4,Better than average,"Benford is usually good, and he doesn't fail here. The Martian Race is far better than the Kim Stanley Robinson series, but not quite up there with Mars Underground or Outpost. The planetology is up-to-date, quite believable for anyone who keeps track of new releases from MGS on the Malin site.Unfortunately my paperback fell apart as I read it. Hopefully it wasn't meant to self-destruct and be read only once."
3,Great Read - Bad Book,"This book is an excellent read with a couple great characters, and an extremely plausible story. There are some places in the book that are cut short and others that are focused on too much. For instance there is too much time spent on the economic race and not enough on the possibility of life on mars.When I read another readers review about his book falling apart at page 92, I couldn't believe it. Mine fell to pieces around page 50. The worst bound book I've ever seen."
1,What a rip-off,I sent $30 for The Martian Race by Gregory Benford thinking I was getting a standard hardback with dust jacket etc. What I recieved was an edition with a text book like quality. A hard glossy finish. I am not sure what kind of edition this was but it was not what I was looking for. In the description it did not mention anything of the sort. I went to a dealer here locally and purchased a signed first edition hardcover with dust jacket for under $30! I donated the copy I recieved from Amazon to a public library. Buyer beware!
4,"Well-paced, interesting Mars novel","This is near-future, hard (no ""warp drive"", ESP, or even nanotech) SF. Benford doesn't really milk the tension of the race to return from Mars, which is probably a good thing. Instead he mixes that drama with character development, the story of exploring Mars, and trying to survive on Mars. All in all, it's a fairly well-paced book. It never really elevates itself to a gripping, ""just one more chapter before I go to bed"" level. But it never really drags either, so I never really found myself bored and wanting to put it down."
4,Another New Wave Classic!,"Representative of the height of the era of New Wave. Songs of troubled moods, dark ages, negative lyrics, positive beats. Excellent!"
5,One of my Absolute Favorites,"With the exception of 'Save Me Tonight', I absolutely love this record from start to finish, particularly 'Broken Heart', 'All Roads Lead to You', and 'I Don't Know Why'. It gives me the (good) shivers just thinking about those songs- if you enjoy thoughtful synth-pop, this is an absolute must :)"
3,naive art,"I also am looking for Naive Dance...it was my first red flag tape and I only had it for three hours before someone ""borrowed"" it.If anyone has any idea on how to get a copy of Naive Dance, please e-mail me."
5,one of the best 80s dance,"I get in my car, I pop this CD in, and let it take me back to the 80s. this CD is full of ---> ""songs you never get tired of"" RED FLAG, thank you =)"
2,right.,"I've been a nextel customer for 5 years. I love the service and the PTT feature. I even love my plan.. but i hate my phone.I've had this phone for 9 months and its unbearable. The phone shuts itself off, freezes and only dials when it feels like it. I have never had more dropped phone calls and the call quality used to be alot better. The first 2-3 months were great. the phone was adorable and problem free but it was all downhill after that. I'm tired of never having service and the scratches all over the phone screen are a pain. I'm looking for a new phone.. I've had enough. While the appearance of the phone is wonderful and will be missed.. I simply cannot wait to finally get a phone that I will have service on."
1,stinks i830,I have had this phone for 1year and it is the worst service I have ever had with a wireless company the battery stinks loses life before the day is up I never have service when I want it and drops calls when you are talking I would not advise getting this phone
3,One question,I am considering getting this phone but I have just one question: does it have external caller id?
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this phone around late July of this year. Although the phone is very sleek and stylish, the battery life and reception on are the worse. I have had so many problems with this phone when placing calls and using Nextel's Direct Connect service that it is not even funny. In addition, the phone is always redialing, especially during off-peak hours. Although Nextel is most popular for their Direct Connect Service and Free Incoming price plans, they are also known for their poor reception. Truth be told, if you go Nextel, buy one of their older model cellphones such as the i95, i90, or i88. A large number of my friends have those models and they never had any trouble out of them. Before this phone, I had both the i530 and i730 in less than a year, and they were a mess as well."
3,The best for Nextel users,"I rate this phone the best for a Nextel user due to it's slim size. I've had mine about a month and am really enjoying not having to strap a phone the size of a brick to my hip.This phone is essentially a 730 slimmed down. It seems the space savings was achieved with a slimmer battery - because mine does need recharging about once per day.I've used the 1000,85,95,73 and now this phone. I prefer a slimmer design over battery life. If you don't mind returning to a charger every so often you'll probably like it. If you are away from a power source and on the phone for a while you will need a spare battery or two. UPDATE 3-29-05: Still enjoy using this phone. The small size and solid construction has worked very well for me. If you're thinking Nextel and want a compact phone I'd definitely look at this model."
4,Great size + built-in TeleNav GPS system,This is the best phone nextel has put out (minus the speaker phone). Its got everything you'd want.small sizebuilt in TeleNav GPS that works like those expensive GPS systemslight weightlooks cooli just wish the speaker was a bit better.I highly reommend it
1,DO not be juju'd by this book,"Not only is this poorly written and sophmoric it is hard to believe that a publisher would actully try to sell it (I found an old copy at a hostel in Africa. I found out why only the first 25 pages had been read) If you are serious about Africa, the experience it can provide, or want to have a really good armchair travel experience read ANYTHING else...It is just that bad"
3,"Much cheaper if you buy the ""Under the Nile"" brand ones","Save some $$ and buy the Under the Nile version of these. They are identical, but Giggle puts their name on these and raises the price. I own both..."
1,A terrible show,"I bought this title after reading a few decent reviews of it here, but it was a total waste of money. I was hoping GaoGaiGar would be similar to Godannar, a recent, terrific robot fighting anime that has similar-looking people (due to having the same character designer). But the two shows are completely different. The directing for GaoGaiGar is awful, the music ranges from bad to downright annoying, and the show has no plot. It's just a 50-episode long ""working"" show where the same repetitive thing happens over and over with every episode.GaoGaiGar feels like a cheesy robot anime that might have been made in the mid 70's. However it was actually produced in 1997, so it's recent enough that no excuses can be given for the poor way in which it was made."
1,Seizure Causing Robot Show,"GaoGaiGar was advertised as a giant robot show made by fans of giant robot shows. If that were true it should have been more like Godannar, Gravion, New Getter Robo, Dai-Guard or Kirameki Project. Instead it's simplistic, repetitive and seem to have been made to sell toys to seven year olds. It's like Voltron, only dumber. If you're under ten you might enjoy it, but if you like old-school robots, stay away from this one."
4,Another great album!,A must buy. Never travel without it. It is amazing how this group just keeps up the stuff they're known for!
4,THOUSNAD YEAR ITCH,"THOUSAND YEAR ITCH combines the style of classic heavy metal music with modern, cutting edge technology to provide lively, adrenaline filled songs about the highs and lows of life on the edge. The songs range from slow-burning to fireworks with some serious guitar work throughout. Along with the bar-busting tracks there are a couple of rock ballads that showcase Dyanna's sultry vocals and a bluesy offering with some guitar riffs that are reminiscent of the old masters. There are also two cover songs that successfully pump new life into old standards. The end result is clean sounding rock-n-roll without all the distorted racket that many artists use to make their work seem creative."
2,bad item description,"I thought I was buying the main grille insert, but it was the bumper insert. Nothing in this description or product info lets you know that you are buying the bottom bumper grille."
5,Branding Your Way to the Top of Your Field,"This book establishes a strong case for branding very early. It then goes on to show you several techniques for creating your brand.Some of these include isolating patterns from your previous successes, writing books, speaking, creating marketable products to reinforce the brand etc.The pay off of successful branding is that it creates an attraction that draws business your way, helps with client retention in the face of competition, and provides you with a guidance system for your practice."
3,Solving Crimes with Forensic Science,The author is an expert at forensics but I was not familiar with the crimes except Ramsey and Moxley. Most of the evidence was removed from the police files of the Moxley murder and I agree with the author's opinion on the Ramsey case.
3,Just OK.,I have seen him lecture in person and his books are just Ho Hum after hearing his dynamic lectures. He does not share any new information or render an opinion on the cases.
2,Hours wasted..,"Well, I was hoping against hope that this the second book of The Bronze Canticles would be better than the first, after all the world was now established, the characters were set and ready to go... yet, what is in this bookis more drivel and a stalled storyline that leaves the reader ready to abandon the book all together. Don't get me wrong, that's not to say that there aren't a couple good points to this book, but in this novel they are few and far between. Which, is rather disappointing considering the great things Hickman was able to do in the Dragonlance world.I really wish I could say something positive about this book, but in the end I just can't do it. While it's not the worst book I have ever read, it is surely not the best either... far from the best actually..."
5,Good Book,I enjoyed this story very much. I recommend it to others. I believe others will enjoy it also. I look forward to other stories from this author.
2,What Happened?,"Usually I can follow a jump in time. This however was a bit much without some kind of prelude or a chapter interlude. I enjoy the authors writting style except for this point, which I found difficult to overcome and still enjoy the book.Joe"
4,Good Speakers for the price,"For the $ these speakers are nice. Installation is easy, and fairly fool-proof. I installed 6 in about 3 hours (the wiring was alreay in place). The speakers do come in pairs. They are NOT high-end speakers. To connect the speaker wires, you have to wrap them around connection tabs, versus the normal ""insert the wire in to the black or red connection point"".Overall, I'm happy with them."
1,Both Speakers Damaged,"Like others who posted reviews on this site, both of my speakers came damaged with broken pieces loose in the packaging. The package itself was not damaged in any way, which leads me to believe these speakers are either very cheaply made or were already broken when shipped. I will be returning them and looking for a different brand."
1,No quality control,"The shipping carton and the inside packaging were both in perfect shape, yet the speaker frame was badly and obviously cracked. It had to be that way when it left the factory. I returned it and it's replacement was likewise damaged."
4,Decent sounding mid-to-high range speakers with 3 inches depth,"I was looking for shallow (about 3 inches with grill cover), inexpensive speakers for background office desk music and to replay recorded meetings. This was what i needed and so I'm happy. I just lean the speakers against the back wall of my desk unit. Sounds fine on ""folk music"", straight acoustic guitar (very good) and just recorded voice (very good); it's not what you want to play rock music at any volume higher than low levels. I'm running them with the small (15 watt) Pylepro PCA1 amp and use equalizer in my MP3 player to boost bass a little. I might bring in a Pylepro PCA2 which has a bass and treble control and would help the sound."
2,"Latino is not a race, Hispanic is not a race","I understand how people may want to group every spanish-speaking country because of convenience, but these people are NOT THE SAME RACE.Of course, each country has its predominant racial majority. For example, white people in Argentina, Amerindian (indigenous) people in Bolivia, and black people in Brazil and Dominican Republic.But we spanish-speakers are of DIFFERENT RACES just like you people in the United States!.Have a great Holiday Season,"
1,They clearly want to take over,"Open the first page and there is an outline map of the US with the word Hola, which is not only a horrible thing to do, it shows the author's intent. There is almost no correct fact in this book. It is filled with propaganda, logical fallacies, and falsehoods."
3,Red Sox Book Review,This book has all the important information you would want on the Red Sox. All the players stats are included. The only down side to this book is the section that is dedicated to crosswords.
5,AWESOME,"I really enjoyed the book! For a first time writer, Dawn is excellent. I admire her courage and strength to write this book in her own words. She is a tell it like it is woman and wants to do what is best for her child and I think this book can be very educational for moms and or parents with severely handicapped children."
2,Extremely Negative Book,"I received this book as a review copy from the publisher because I am an employee of an early intervention program. I work with families who have children with devastating birth defects or diagnoses, some even more involved than the author's son, Jacob. However, most of the families have at least something positive to say about their child and sometimes even about the people they never would have met except for the tragedy that occurred. Although this book does demonstrate how important it is to be an advocate for your child, I am reluctant to share this book with parents of children with disabilities because it is so negative. I would hate for a new parent of a child with a disability to feel that they only have continual struggles ahead of them with no hope of joyous moments. Additionally, the obviously unedited book has numerous grammatical and spelling errors that were very obvious when trying to read the book."
3,Compelling yet flawed,"This is a mystery story. True, it is nonfiction, but it is a mystery, nonetheless, the mystery of David. Halpern does a good job of solving this mystery and showing us what the real David was probably like, but it is a rough journey to see the solution.Halpern has done his research and definitely knows his stuff. Unfortunately, he is not very good at presenting his material; this book has all the detail and tedium of a courtroom trial (although he does give warnings about the most technical chapters). The overall organization is not well-thought out; he revisits the same information over and over again.I think that this is almost a good book. Halpern does get his point across and shows that David was not as heroic as he is often thought of. He brings out the reality behind the myth. If he only could lay out the details better, this book would go from almost good to either good or great."
5,Not Quite Like Anything You've Ever Seen,"I saw this DVD years ago during a trip to England, long before it made its way to this side of the pond. This is not like anything you've ever seen and is deeply worthy of the cult status it has around the world. Your jaw will drop in the first minutes of the film and not make its way back closed until long after it's over. And it will be a ride straight through. It's incredible and audacious (as are all of Aussie Rolf de Heer's works). Its sharply funny, deeply disturbing and a great piece of filmmaking. Watch it, but not on a first date!"
4,"Weird, fascinating, unpredictable","This movie was really weird and different. I saw it last night & I can't stop thinking about it! It tells the story of a 35 year old man who is basically an idiot with no social skills. His mother keeps him in their apartment, NEVER allowing him outside. She bathes & shaves him, he applies her make-up. They even have sex! When Bobby's father comes back, Bobby is forced out into the world where he has some crazy adventures. He also becomes a serial killer named the ""The Cling Wrap Killer"". This movie has a LOT of nudity and 4 people and (2 cats) die in it. If you like ""art-sy"" movies, you'll love Bad Boy Bubby."
3,Nothing new here,"Mike Dorosh's review is accurate. Writing military history is about solid research and pinning down the facts, something that is continually missed in this series of books. While they could have made a solid contribution to the literature on the Canadian Army in the Second World War and on the Italian Campaign, these books offer nothing new - which is not really a problem on its own - but given the numerous errors, it is simply not worth reading."
1,the first rock that hopped up hit my windshield just as if I never had this thing in place : (,"Well, it was worth a try. My husband asked me to purchase and install it so I did. It made him momentarily happy, so for that it was $50 well spent, however I would NEVER recommend this shield as a means of protecting an automobile windshield as it does not perform whatsoever and ultimately proves to be a WASTE of money. Steer Well Clear of this purchase. : ("
3,Not reach my expectation!,"This deflector is not working very well, I didn't feel anything different compare with before; I still get bugs and stones on my windshield even on 75~80 MPH. also both edges are not even!(one side looks too low almost touch my hood)"
2,bug shield,Ordered this thinking it would cover more surface area then i actually does. Seems kind of chintzy too. Very disappointed
2,Unhappy customer,"We purchased this product to use on our deck for the summer. The package was complete, with everything we needed to assemble the arbor, but it would have been nice if everthing fit as expected. I always thought 10x13 was the same everywhere, but this 10x13 is only 10x12.5. We had a terrible time putting the framing together, and it was impossible to attach the plastic tarp to the frame, without figuring out our own way to secure it. Once secured, the framework bows in several places, and it looks terrible. We had such a terrible experience assembling this (although we've put one up each summer for the past 8 years), that we were not going to return it, and go through having to erect another. We are, however, keeping our fingers crossed that it makes it to September, like our other arbors have done in the past."
1,a terrible item,It is a terrible tent. No real instruction and it doesn't hold up at all. Very hard to put up and the fabric doesn't fit the frame.
5,The book I've been waiting for,"I've been a fan of McHugh's since her first novel, ""China Mountain Zhang,"" but have felt as though she hadn't written the book I've been wanting her to write. Well, with ""Nekropolis"" she has delivered that book. This is an engaging, extremely well-written view of the future, from a perspective that most science fiction writers simply don't give us -- the perspective from the 'have-nots' in a more technologically sophisticated time. She explores issues of class, gender, sexuality and power in an emotionally accessible, even compelling, fashion. There is not a trace of didacticism in this book, yet it is an extremely serious look at important sociological issues. For fans of LeGuin, Russ, Tepper, I would immediately and highly recommend this novel."
3,Interesting Concept; Writing Not Srong,"The cover states ""A Literary novel in Sci-Fi clothing"" but, really its the other way around. Characters are not particularly strong. A poor woman's version of Margaret Atwood. The concept: lab-created people and jessed people try to find happiness in a future world should be compelling, but the writing doesn't quite carry it off. This has the look and feel of a pulp novel. It's a little better than that, but it's not ""literature""."
2,Quick read but where was it going?,"Ok I picked up this book because of the Amazon list suggested it to me. Flew through it just this morning but I'm not certain why. There was good character development, gratuitous sex that actually was useful at building that character. But the thing most missing for me was the flavor of the time that the story takes place in the future, I just wasn't brought into that world. I didn't care about the characters because they weren't all that deep. I've another of the authors books I picked up and hope to report back better."
1,This book is just awful,"What a huge disappointment. How many times the heroine weep? Fifteen? Twenty? Nekropolis doesn't really have a plot. It is made up of 5 sections, each written by a different character. Unfortunately, the character selected for the main focal point is a miserable creature of victimhood. See if you can follow this logic: Our heroine's brother is caught having an affair, therefore she decides she is unclean and must sell herself into chemical slavery. And yet, her sister seems to have no trouble finding a husband and starting a family. Several characters make enormous risk/sacrfices for the miserable heroine, but her gratitude, or even her awareness of these sacrifices, is remote. I only read this book because it appearred on SF Site top 10 list for the year. I had already been bored with China Mountain Zhang and Half the Day is Night, I shall not be fooled again. This is an BAD book."
5,Highly recommended!,"This book has 120 Sudoku puzzles with grids of 4x4, 6x6, and 9x9. All the puzzles are of the classic type using numbers. There are no alphabet sudoku puzzles that are played with letters. The puzzles increase gradually in difficulty from the beginning to the end of the book. Although this book is for kids, the simple 4x4 puzzles are limited to only 20 puzzles. For a book with solely 4x4 puzzles and with alphabet sudoku, check the book ""Kindergarten Sudoku""."
4,GREAT way to brighten up an old infant seat,"After 4 boys, I was ready for my little girl to have PINK! So I covered up the old drab black and white infant car seat with a beautiful bumble bag. Washes easily. The only thing that would keep it from being a 5 star is that I wish the canopy part had come with a plastic insert to fit into the car seat ~ I had lost my old canopy so I wasn't able to use the old one and had to make a bendable plastic ""thing"" so that the canopy would work."
1,boring and drab,"This book doesn't look any different than any BH&G magazine out on the newsstand - and maybe it's the same thing just tweeked a bit. Lot's of pictures, but sadly this book offers few new or fresh ideas. Save your pennies, friends!"
5,Full of ideas and answers,"We love color but had not found a decorating book about color that actually helped us and showed real homes until we got this one. It's the kind of book we can flip through for ideas because the photos are great. But we also can get answers to the kinds of decorating questions other books never seem to address. Finally, the book presents optional solutions for each common decorating question, so we can begin to see how we might actually decorate our own rooms. I highly recommend this book for anyone, like me, who is stuck in a builder beigs house or apartment and is yearning for some color. It's also a great guide if you're ready to buy some new carpeting or repaint your walls, because it tells you how to pull rooms (or your entire main floor) together."
3,"Not bad, but not terribly helpful for me","This is a good book to buy if you have color questions that you want answered, such as what color paint will go with your wood furniture, or how to approach decorator problems. It's not a bad book, but it didn't demystify color for me ... I didn't feel after reading it that I was confident and ready to go paint and decorate my home. I feel like I need another book."
1,Unbelievable!,"This book belongs in the Jokes and Humor category! I am a Pakistani, and I can say with shame that this book does no justice to what is well known to every Pakistani. Pakistan lost pathetically to India in 1965.. we almost lost our cosmopolitan city of Lahore to an onslaugh of an Indian regiment. Had it not been for the hard headed patriots who tied TNT to their bodies and snuck under Indian tanks.. we were gone for. Pakistan Air Force, no matter how patriotic did not stand a chance against well organized and sophisticated Indian counterpart. It's a shame who the Pakistani government will recruit to spread its propoganda. UNBELIEVABLE!"
1,A nice book for the kiddies,"If cinderella,snow white and alice in wonderland don't put your children to sleep,then I seriously recommend fricker's 'Battle for pakistan'.You can read all sorts of fantasial fairytales on how the mighty pakistan airforce destroyed india,how one wizard called MM Alam shot down 5 aircraft in 30 seconds and all sorts of delusional drivel that's a great replacement for the usual bedtime stories.If your kids do ask 'What's pakistan',don't tell them the truth or they'll get pretty disgusted.'Battle for pakistan' is the best fairytale book I've ever read!It's also great for those wannabe dictators who want to know how to conduct transparent propoganda."
1,Rather pathetic,"The book should have been renamed :""The pakistani version of the 1965 air-war"" which it absolutely is and hence as usual is quite far from the truth.One should not mistake Fricker to be neutral,it is well known that he is a close friend of the PAF and was employed by them to write this book based on their usually absurd and fake claims.The book itself is full of contradictions and can easily be seen as an attempt at propoganda rather than a true and dedicated analysis.Neither is the PAF as good as described nor did they win any air-war.War is not a numbers game and getting 3-4 kills more than your opponent does not make a winner.The book is full of manufactured facts,horribly inaccurate figures and can lead the inexperienced reader to come to a false conclusion."
1,Absolutely horrifying,"The book is simply one of the worst I've ever read.I've never seens so much truth-twisting,propoganda or garbage written.What is the purpose of the book?To mislead pakistanis into thinking that their airforce is actually good?There is'nt a single FACT nor a shread of truth in this book.Everyone knows what happened to pakistan during it's wars and in 1965 it was absolutely thrashed.Why do they go on and on with their lies even today?Why can't they just go on with life?I'm very disappointed to have wasted my money on such rubbish and I hope this saves the potential buyer some precious bucks."
1,Pure Bilge,"Goebbels would have been proud of this book(?). The fact is the PAF was trounced in that war. I ought to know first hand as I was an 8 yr old kid in Amritsar at that time and I literally saw Sabres being shot out of the sky. My father went on to use the metal from the fallen jets to make steel trunks! And by the way, in case delusionary Pakis think they won that war they ought to remember that Indian forces reached the outskirts of Lahore with Dograi under Indian occupation. Fricker must be smoking a special intoxicant given by the hallucinating PAF."
5,Makes Practicing a Joy,Virtually every volume of trombone technique I've consulted refers to this work and its companion Book 2. Now I know why: It's filled with beautiful études of medium difficulty that make practice a joy. A very reasonably priced volume that should handsomely repay dividends over many years of use.
5,Melodious Etudes for Trombone Book 1,This is a required book for auditions at colleges and universities. The book arrived quickly and in great shape for our son to start readying himself for his college auditions
5,Post Office ruins book.,"Not a fair review as the book came completely destroyed with a nice ""check the box"" apology. No information from US Post on how to get reimbursed. Surprised?"
5,O1594 - Melodious Etudes for Trombone Book 1 (see item #O1954X - new REVISED edition),"This is a great book to work out of, I love it! The book that I received had a different cover than I had ever seen on this book, but the contents are the same."
4,Fascinating Read!,"I enjoyed this book by psychic medium Allison Dubois on a number of levels. First, as a fan of the show MEDIUM, I loved the intimate details Dubois shares about herself and her work - including how her life became a TV show. (Sounds like the portrayal is pretty true-to-life.) Most of all, as one who is fascinated by the work of psychic mediums and the paranormal, I loved her often touching stories about specific readings she has done. These stories make up the bulk of DON'T KISS THEM GOODBYE. It's an easy, enjoyable read. Dubois's view of her special gift is so positive. What she shares about her supernatural experiences and her encounters with her clients' loved ones is very life affirming (and AFTER-life affirming.)"
4,Helped me understand the afterlife and psychic abilities does exist,Allison shares her world with us and helps us understand what it's like to have the gift. The book also reinforced my belief in the afterlife. Easy reading and a positive book.
1,Don't waste your money,"I mostly bought this book because I am a fan of the TV show Medium and thought this book might give me an idea of who / what the real person was. I was hoping also to hear more about the criminal profiling aspect of Alison Dubois' ""gift"". Unfortuantely none of the above were achieved. This book seems to be more about telling it's audience to accept the psychic's in their lives. I didn't feel it gave me any insight into the afterlife. Overall I was very disappointed."
1,"Little substance and worse writing, don't waste your money","This book presents the experiences of the author. While some of the experiences are insightful and interesting, overall little is gained from reading this book. Moreover, the author is a poor writer. The book is written practically as a stream of consciousness, with little attention to structure or grammar. Don't waste your money."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I read this book cover to cover without putting it down. Then, sent it off to my mom to read. :)Not only does this book tell you of Allison's experiences, but it also guides you in understanding your own gifts (if you have them).For anyone who lost a loved one, this is a ""must read"", as it will help you deal with the loss.I give it 5 stars, and both thumbs up (too bad I only have two)."
4,Definitely an interesting read for a Medium fan,"I bought the book due to being a fan of the show Medium. Really cool to see the simularities but a bit disappointing to find out how much liberties Hollywood takes. However I got over that quickly - I enjoyed reading her experiences with certain ""sitters"" and those who have passed on and she offers great advice to parents who may have a budding medium. However, I found myself wanting more.Looking forward to a next one or, at least, the next season of Medium."
2,Not What I Thought it Would Be,"My father recently passed away and I guess I was looking for a ""how to"" book on how to stay connected with him. This book seemed more of a book and how to behave if you are a medium. It had interesting stories from the author's life, but nothing that was useful to me or anything that convinced me that my Dad was still with me."
5,WELL DONE!!,This is a great read for those who have grieved over the loss of a loved one or wondered about the continued existence of consciousness after death. I found some of her understanding of spiritual experiences here enlightening- for example that people who radiate very positive energy attract like a beacon- those spirits who are not loving and wish to do us harm. She offers sound practical advice that has clearly been earned though her challenging personal journey. Thank you Allison for sharing this.
3,Open your heart to the possibility,"Although I found the writing a bit stilted, the ideas rang true. And whereas another reviewer said most of us ""will never encourage an adolescent psychic"", well, I disagree. As Allison knows, most of us, no matter what our age, ARE adolescent psychics, scared of what we think we know and tentative to use our intuitive powers. The book didn't really entertain me much but for the next several days I felt my own psychic powers kick in more often. For that reason alone I recommend reading it."
2,Book,"The seller sent the book in a wonderful condition and very prompt. I bought this book because the author is the basis of the TV show ""Medium."" And, I found it mediocre, in my opinion. Although I believe the author is a sincere person, the book itself was rather dull. But, you would need to determine the merits of this book on your own."
1,Don't Quit Your Day Job...,"I could barely get through this book. I am interested in the subject, study the subject and am developing my own skills. I feel like a 10 year old could have written this better. Also, I was expecting actual information on how to develop and/or more details on some of the cases she was involved in. I read the whole book because I love the subject and the show, but I can't find one thing nice to say about the book. E for effort..."
2,"Love the show, not the book....","I read Allison Dubois book over the weekend and although I do believe she has ""abilities"" I thought the book was very very weak. It didn't tell me anything about anything. I am one for detail and in depth explanation and this short book provided none. It only contained brief ""descriptions"" of readings she has done, scientific experiments, but doesn't explain what it is truly like to be a medium. I think that next time she should add a lot more detail and documentation notes if possible or at least better describe events or what she FEELS. I am interested in what she sees and feels, explain it to me, I want to know."
5,AN INTERESTING READ...,"I read this book the same day I bought it. Like another reviewer, I wish it would have had more detail, but one with an open mind will not regret buying it because it is interesting.Don't let the ""nay sayers"" in these reviews discourage you from getting the book. They have only given their narrow-minded opinions about psychic phenomena and I wonder if they have even picked up the book, much less read it.Granted, there are a lot of fakes who scam people under the guise of calling themselves psychic, but Alison is not one of them. She would not have the support of professionals like Dr. Gary E. Schwartz and law enforcement if she were."
2,Disappointing and unconvincing,"I bought this book a while ago and tried to read it (I got so bored I could not finish it) with an open mind. I found the writing style amateurish and the total effect unconvincing. There is no effort made to support her claims and if you are looking for some type of evidential support for her claims - you won't find it here. Alison may have some form of mediumistic ability but it does not come through in this book. If anything, she now (in my opinion) has no more credibility than a TV psychic. If you are already a believer and don't want any 'proof' then you may find this a good read."
5,"A cheerful, hopeful conversation with a friend.","Allison DuBois is a down-to-earth psychic! The speptics will dismiss her book and her abilities, as they will dismiss anything that contradicts their own opinions-as-law.If you are looking for sensationalism, you must look elsewhere. The author presents her experiences and abilities without in-depth scientific explanations. She offers none, quite simply because she is who she is and does what she does. It is as natural to her as breathing.If you are a skeptic, pass this book over because Allison DuBois' easy-going presentation will enrage you. If you have an opened mind, this volume will convince you that there is something more after this life. If you already believe, prepare to have your spirit renewed by a sincere and wonderful author."
5,Living the bold and daring uncommon life,"If you've lost a loved one, have psychic intuitive abilities that you are trying to figure out, if you are a fan of Jonathan Edwards or James Van Praagh or Tiffany Snow or Sylvia Browne, this book will be a pleasure. Understand what it is like to live the unique life, one where no path is there to follow, and the trail blazing is left up to you. May we each be as bold!"
3,thought provoking story,This book presents a more balanced view of the life of a person who has a special gift. Good and bad are fairly shown.
2,Not so much,"I'm interested in all things related to the possibility of life after death so I bought the book. It's okay, but honestly, I'm not real interested in her thoughts and family life and complete history, etc. All that is relevant, and should be addressed, but in a few chapters at most. I wish she would have included a LOT more readings and a lot less of her personal stuff."
2,Allison Dubois is the real thing but....,"I thought this book would be more about Allison and that it may tie in with ""Medium"" the television series. It was more about how to tell if your child has the gift and how to handle it - there were some real life stories - interesting that she does not get her information in dreams like the TV show. Other than that I feel I wasted the money on both her books. Not so great - although I love the show."
2,It's ok,"This book does have summaries of her cases and some examples. I just feel that the book jumps around and the book doesn't flow very well. I found quite a few grammar errors. It seems almost like you're reading a journal or having a conversation with her. So it's ok in that aspect. I guess I was expecting more details of the other side. For instance, how the spirits get there? What do they do all day? Does Mrs. Dubois believe in reincarnation like other mediums? Etc."
1,A Ghost Writer Was in Order,"Too bad Allison didn't contact a dead writer on the other side, or at least a living ghost writer. This book is absolutely horrible. The woman cannot write effectively and what she does say is just fluff. I suffered through two-thirds of it before I realized she was never going to talk in any detail whatsoever about her psychic experiences. She may be a psychic, but she has nothing interesting to say. If you want a really good book about psychic experiences, I reccomend _A Farther Shore_."
2,"Amusing read, but not a quide for real life","I disagree with the author's advice about letting a child go to the police with a ""psychic premonition"".I've read a lot of true crime stories.Most ""psychic premonitions"" are either wrong or too general to be of any use (e.g., ""The victim will be found near a source of water.""--people can't live without water, and the source of water could be a bottle of water, etc.).Sometimes, the killer will pretend to be ""psychic"", and tell police where to find his/her victim!If a ""psychic"" injects him/herself into a police investigation, the police have been known to treat the ""psychic"" as a ""person of interest""--interrogating and detaining the person.I wouldn't want anyone, espically a child, to have a bad experience or get a bad reputation by going to the police with a ""psychic premonition""."
3,Kiss and Tell,"I found the book interesting. I believe that Allison does indeed have a gift, but the writing and the subject matter was a little to immature for me. She spent too much time talking about how to help others and not enough time talking about herself and her experiences. Perhaps the next book (which I have) will be more of what I am looking for. I do enjoy the TV series."
4,Interesting,I bought this book because I have a niece who has an extraordinary insight into the paranormal. It was very helpful in being able to understand what she deals with.
1,This book is so bad I couldn't finish it!,"I tried, really I did. A friend of mine told me the television show was good. After watching a few shows I agreed and thought that the book would be an interesting read.The writing is so bad that I find it hard to believe the publisher provided Ms. DuBois an editor.This is the first time in my life (mid 50's) that I put a book aside knowing that I would never pick it up to finish. I kept reading, sometimes literally groaning, hoping things would improve.The book is filled with judgemental opinions and condescending remarks that just fill up space. When I read her statement that a deceased friends husband stayed married to her friend just for insurance money that was the last of it for me. Who cares and how does she know? That was just mean spirited (no pun intended) I was happy to put the book down. You'll be happy if you never pick the book up."
1,Kiss this book good-bye,"I find the subject of psychics helping to solve crimes fascinating. Too bad this is such a terrible book. At most, there a few very uninformative, uninsightful paragraphs about the crimes she's helped solve. But most of the book is mindless, sophomoric blather about what to do if your teenage daughter is psychic. Not exactly a situation many of us readers will ever be in. The book is so superficial and lacking in substance that I began to doubt her psychic abilities. Definitely one of the poorest excuses for a book I've ever skimmed."
1,Needs years of therapy,"Allison Dubois is a sick, childish, imbalanced, nasty, insecure, competitive narcissist. And I normally never have anything but kind words for anybody but I was absolutely sickened and repulsed when I saw her in action on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills show. It disturbed me to learn that there were really people like that in the world. And she should not be allowed to call herself a medium. Medium's by trade and nature are people who are spiritual and really want to help others not dump unwarranted visions of grandiosity on others."
3,Just OK,"Allison's writing is unfocused and confusing. I felt like I was reading a first draft of this book and not the final edited version. I suspect this book was rushed, to make sure it was out before the TV show aired, and it suffers because of it. I am sure Allison is a fascinating person and I would like to hear what she has to say but I hope the next time around she is given the time, and opportunity to collaborate with a professional writer."
3,mediums are real,It is hard to think of real people being psychic.This book tells you about a real person who is just like all of us only is also a medium. Now you will see why the TV show is a hit. Very interesting reading. A quick weekend read.
3,It was okay,Ms. Dubois book was okay. I honestly felt she should have delved more into her gift and used more past stories to illustrate her unique gift instead of giving us an autobiography of her life.
1,Horrible quality,"For a jacket with an original list price of over a hundred, this jacket is dead cheap. Every component of this jacket is bad; the zipper is bulky, the lining is roughly done, the down filling is thin. It doesn't have a warm/cozy feeling as one can expect from its puffy look, instead it is thin. I was very unsatisfied with this purchase. If you're looking for a winter jacket that will perform well at below freezing temperatures, DO NOT BUY THIS JACKET."
4,Warm for the price!,Warm for the price but does not hold well if rained on. Down starts to poke out of the fabric after a couple of years
2,Disappointing Souvenir,"I would dearly love to recommend this album, having searched for it for ages as a kid--on vinyl, yet--but having obtained the CD version, I have to warn all Dolls fans the world over not to be terribly impressed with this one.The performance sounds worthy--ditto for the new tracks--but the sound quality is atrocious. Usually I can take a spotty recording, especially depending on who the artist is. But posterity notwithstanding, even the five songs they recorded on Don Kirschner's 'Rock Concert' (Stranded..., Trash, Chatterbox, Don't Start Me Talkin', Personality Crisis) would have been better than this one."
5,Hey man that's something else,"It's the New York Dolls Live, what vcan I say. you're probably dead bored of hearing about the sound quality but it clears up a bit on Something Else. The only problems throughout the record his the guitars are buried by the rest of the band and everytime they do a ""doo-doo dodoo"" it's fuzzy louder than everything else.Closest we'll ever get to a third album. i definately recommend this.Hey a bit o trivia I think it was around '00/'01 when a record company offered Sylvain Sylvain 1 million dollars to do a New York Dolls reunion, his reply was ""Hey I agreed to do one back in '84. The only one who won't do it is David."""
5,Love the interviews.,I love Alieen Wurnous! I dont know but I just do. I bought this new for only a couple of cents. It was in great condition when I bought it.
3,"It was Okay, could been better.","I thought we would see more about Aileen life, especially when she was younger and what cause her to killed but we see mostly her lawyer and her adoptive mother. I found it very barbaric to still killed people in the electric chairs, I cannot beleive they still do this and especially for Ailleen Wuornos, who would not want to kill someone who rape you and torture you, she said she did it for self-defense...well so many men it kinna odd but who know it maybe true. I don't say I approuve of what she did, of course not, it not right to killed but it sure not right to killed her too. It obvious she got emotional problems and killing her is not the solution, God society is sick. Her adoptive mother seem like a loony, she said she love Aileen so much but she want her to die for her sins, she cannot take another trial, wow how motherly she is. She live a tragic life and she had a tragic death, I find all this very sad."
3,Overwritten but entertaining sexual melodrama about an absolute bitch...,"In this sexual melodrama--where the flow of bad language was new at the time--Liz is the dark heroine, a passionate woman who listens to blaring rock; Susannah York is the misty-eyed fair heroine, all prissy decorum, who listens to dignified classical music... Paunchy Michael Caine is the man between... The contest is merely an excuse for Liz, as the randy wife of a straying husband, to bask in the vulgarity she has such contagious fun with...Like Maggie the Cat, Liz-Zee is determined to ensnare her man, even going so far as to seduce her rival... Taylor's embrace of Susannah York is awfully tentative, altogether lacking the fervor of her attentions to Lassie or Paul Newman or Montgomery Clift...Overwritten but entertaining, this sexual melodrama is a blatant and hollow confection... Two hours of relentless bitching by Liz, it's a valentine to her fans, a good-natured send-up of her earth mother, sex goddess image..."
3,Liz is at IT again,"Liz stars as Zee. A woman who will do anything (and we do mean ANYTHING) to keep her husband (Caine) who seems to be going though a mid life crisis, and also has a eye for Susanah York (who gives a rather interestingly dull perfomance. Liz shows a flair for comedy here, and this writer feels the producers should have let her show it off a liitle more. Im sure eyebrows were raised at the initial time of its release, because of its tone, but nevertheless, Liz is as always, an eyeful to see.Michael A. Turner Baltimore , MD"
5,elizabeth daughter of the tamed shrew?,"What a movie! at 57, fights, domestic, control, enticed intrigue ambigouse sexuallity and competitive OMG! what you won't do for love ?"
4,Ive heard Jeckle bros too,"yes its true Jeckle bro's isnt near as good as i hoped it would be but it's not too bad once you listen to it a couple time you learn like it. ""Everyboady on the East Side rize"""
5,UPDATE,"I have heard it, and like ICP, it is MAD FRESH!!! The 5th Jokers Card is going to be the shit! PREPARE FOR THE DARK CARNIVAL TO SWEEP ACROSS THE NATION!!!"
4,Undercover Covers Uncovered,"For a while this one was hard to find; I'd long suspected it was a copyright issue keeping this delightfully devlish album from mass release. My LP copy is pretty worn, which is especially painful when I try to listen to ""The Baby King,"" told in five parts to actual children who are unwittingly absorbing a parable about Elvis. My kids love these versions, and are surprised when they hear the originals on the radio. Their favorites, and mine, are ""Blue Suede Shoes,"" ""Teddy Bear,"" ""Return to Sender"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel."" My only complaint with the album is that it starts to sag near the end, where the band seems a little less inspired and the concept grows a little tired. But the Residents should be hailed for presenting us with an Elvis many of us suspect is closer to the true item than any other biography, and certainly any Elvis movie."
2,Once there was a baby and the baby wanted to be king.,"This album features the Residents doing Elvis songs, periodically interupted by someone telling the fable of ""the baby king"". It's an intersting concept, but the excecution leaves much to be desired. While ""the baby king"" parable is fairly interesting, the Elvis cover songs are virtually unlistenable. I realize that the Residents have a cult following, but if this is the kind of music they make, it must be a small cult."
5,Classic Christmas,This is a very pretty song collection. I put this on to clean house & wrap gifts. Very nice. I would recommend it.
5,Very well made,I really like these earrings. They are made very well and they are larger than what I thought they would be. I'm very pleased with them! Great price too!
4,Won't fit 22/45,"Fit my buddy's MK II bull barrel perfectly. However I ordered for my 22/45 and that DOES NOT fit.Listing should address that.But overall it's still a good holster, like all FOBUS products."
3,Not for use as a competition holster,I was hopeful that I could use this in competition but when I tried a quick draw it would hang up if I didn't try to snatch the weapon it worked quite well. If I was using this holster to carry my Mark III and drew it in a little slower manner it would serve great. I returned this item as the holster I got with my XD works quite well.
1,Does not fit well at all,I have two different Mark 3's and they both do not fit the holster well at all. Had to loosen the trigger guard bolt all the way and I still have to jam the pistol into the holster. The opening where the trigger guard goes in is now completely out of shape.
1,NO WRITING,"This book should only be sold with a BIG warning: THIS BOOK HAS NO WRITING!!Ok, so a few reviews now mention this fact, but when I ordered the book there was NO WARNING that this book had no writing. As a big fan of Mercer Mayer's Little Critter series and also The Great Brain series, I was very disappointed."
5,Nice,This is another nice book to have in your library if your are a SLP like me. Use it with my students often.
5,Excercise your Imagination :),"I bought this book because it was one of my childhood favorites, and I knew its wordlessness would allow my daughter to learn how to tell a story using visual clues. However, she's not at that stage yet and it has been challenging MY imagination instead! What a wonderful excercise for old and young minds alike :)Wonderful drawings too!!!"
3,Picture book for children,The book was in new condition and arrived in a timely manner. I teach preschool age children. This picture book had too many pages for the age group I was looking for.
4,Good Resource for History of the Christmas Food Celebration,"Beautifully photographed and illustrated historical cookbook. This book is a delightful education in the history of Christmas cooking in America. You feel as though you are touring a museum decorated for the holidays with delicious spreads and a peek in the kitchen. The kind hostess left a copy of the recipe for you to take home and try. I was attracted to the photo of Christmas barley candy made in molds to look like stained glass ships and circus animals. The text unfolds a story of the influences and changes in American Christmas celebrations. I love cookbooks where the photos let you savor the foods while you read and with this book I can almost smell the ""Humbug Pie"". There are close ups of the completed recipes so you see how your attempts should look. This book is a great find for those who love historical cookbooks."
5,The Christmas Cook,"Beautiful book, delicious pictures, very interesting background and well ""translated"" recipes. I'm delighted to have this book. Clean and little used for an ex-library book."
3,Ok .......,"I actually saw TSOL on multiple tours and every record they were doing something completely different so the crowd was bummed - best show I saw them at was the Metro (Chicago) where they played ""Dance with me"" songs peppered with some ""Beneath the Shadows"" songs (both those records I thought are brilliant) This record I could really never get into although I saw them on this tour also at the Cubby Bear in Chicago and I sat with Mitch Dean at the bar and he was super cool - anyways yes I agree with the reviewers that said this record was better than it should of been however TSOL to me is with Jack fronting the band - anyways - cheers"
4,"Changed style, still good","This is rated way too low, and I have to correct that some with my own opinion. I have all of TSOL's prior work in addition to Hit and Run. Yes, they used to have a punk edge, and yes Revenge is an absolute classic everyone should have. Hit and Run, however, is an excellent metal release. I don't see how you could not love this release if you like GnR's Appetite for Destruction and later releases. The vocals are good, the lyrics are good, the playing is good, and the production is good."
2,Not as good as their other efforts,"Had some of their old albums on vinyl when I was into punk as a kid. Not their best effort, Revenge much better"
2,Too simple for the real world,"This book does not provide any information that could not be found in a college level textbook. The assumptions and examples provided in the book are over simplified. If you are anything higher than a junior accountant I would suggest you purchase something else. Calling this book a ""Controller's Guide"" is just plain wrong."
3,"Ahh, the smell.","The smell of this stuff is my favorite part about it.I love the smell. It works well in shorter hair, in my opinion, it leaves longer hair looking more oily."
2,Sumo Tech WAS the Best Styling Cream/Gel,"I used Sumo Tech a lot before...and I liked so much that I didn't mind paying for the premium. However, over the last couple of years I've witnessed the quality of this product go down the toilet. It maybe a coincidence, I think it started when B&B; products started appearing in stores like Target (nothing against Target, though...because I LOVE Target). I've bought from three different sources: one from B&B; online store, one from a B&B; salon, and one through here...and after that i stopped buying the product: it clumps like there's no tomorrow and it has become very hard to apply on my hair without leaving residue on it; forget about applying it on dry hair.It's a shame, because the brand I'm using now (Aveda Pure Performance Grooming Clay)--while it's good in its own right--is nowhere near as good as Sumo Tech ever was. I hope the decline in quality of B&B; products doesn't happen to the rest of their product line."
2,not fragrance free,"Just so you know, if you are sensitive to fragrances, this is not fragrance-free. I had to look at the actual label to see that fragrance is an ingredient."
4,"Sumo Tech is great, but there are better priced options","I've used Bumble and Bumble Sumo Tech for the past couple of years after a stylist at a salon recommended it. I have very fine hair, and this really helps give extra body without weighing my hair down.However, upon hearing other reviews here on Amazon, I was made aware of a similar product called American Crew Fiber. When my last tin of Sumo Tech ran out, I gave the new one a chance. Turns out, it's just as good, cheaper, and the tin has more product (3.53 vs 1.5 oz). The only mild downside is that I'm not as fond of the smell of Fiber as much as Sumo Tech. But for 4x the value, Fiber wins."
2,Very thick and sticky,"I bought this at a local authorized salon. It is very hard like plastic and you need to dilute it with a little warm water. It does not glide through your hair freely. Even after diluting with water, this hard wax-like substance doesn't completely dissolve. Definitely not for long hair nor dry hair."
2,Expensive version of great product.,"This is a great product but the same as Modern Organic Products Molding Cream and American Crew Fiber, which are A LOT cheaper. Check out the ingredients to compare."
1,Died after one season,I purchased this last summer but haven't used it for a while - last week when I plugged it in it did not come on at all. Very dissappointed as I loved it when I first got it.
3,"Almost the perfect grill, but...","I was also tired of my Foreman grill and bought this for the panini capability and the multiple positions it has.The good - very easy to take apart and clean. Flavors are better with hot dogs and hamburgers - they're juicier and not 'flattened'.The bad - I would love for it to have a timer and to beep when it's hot enough. For the price, I'd expect one. But, instead, we get a little dial that goes red when it's not ready. Grilling at first was hit or miss - burgers would be charred on the outside and red inside. Finally figured it out after a few bad experiences.It could be the perfect 'do it all' grill. But, it's not there yet."
4,Sandwich maker,Good value sandwich maker. Good engineering. Fairly big so adequate for family. make sure you have enough space for it on your counter.
1,NYPD FAIL,I bought one of these hats after 9/11 (I lived in NYC from 1994-1999) and am SICK to my stomach after watching the crackdown in NY. I feel like burning it now.
4,I like it,This book was helpful and came in almost new condition. It did the job. No complaints.. because it was required for the class I was taking.
4,For School....,"I bought this book for school, but I have to say it is very interesting and written an easy understandable way, so if you want to learn something about China, this is a great book."
3,Not very fragrant,"While I love D&G Light Blue because of its light and airy scent, I found myself a bit disappointed with the performance of the shower/bath gel. It smells great while you're bathing but doesn't deliver much afterwards. I layer products, so ultimately the gel's lack of staying power isn't a huge deal for me, but if you're buying it to use alone, I would reconsider."
4,Danzig Remixes Should Please Most Fans...,"Not everyone is a fan of remixes to metal/rock songs, but Danzig really knows how to mix it up on this remix album. Comes with six different mixes of ""Sacrifice"" (of course, the album mix is the best one), and two different remixes of the song ""Deeper"", plus a remix of ""Serpentia"", which is actually good. Overall, if you like Danzig period, then this remix mini-album might be for you.Short review, mostly to the point...you'll either like this or not. That's up to you, the listener, to decide."
4,Good instructional CD,"This CD-Rom was very useful for me and my daughter (my daughter is 6 yrs old and a green belt, I am a yellow belt). The video and the ability to watch the video in slow motion and from a different angle is great! My daughter really appreciated being able to watch and follow along over and over again - it is definitely more patient than a master. I only wish the quality of the digital video was a bit better but considering the technology available to the makers at the time it is O.K. It is enough for me to practice my poomse just by listening to the narration which is very detailed. I would recommend this CD-Rom to Tae Kwon Do students who need help practicing their poomse at home."
3,Get a better translation: maybe Penguin Modern Classic,"This version was pretty good. I enjoyed the story...thought it was very interesting. But the translation wasnt what i had expected. It was confusing at times, and i know there has got to be a better translation out there. Im currently reading The Trial (Penguin Modern Classic) and the translation is easy to read -- has a real nice flow to it. So, yeah...i recommend this book, because it opens the doorway to Kafka's style of writing with his most famous work. Plus this version is pretty inexpensive. But once you read it, im sure youll find that his other works (i.e. The Trial) are more engaging."
3,"A nice work, but...","A nice short story; it's only about 50 pages in this bantam classics edition with the rest of the 100+ pages devoted to critical essays and documents. This work is considered a masterpiece of the 20th century literature; this book and Kafka's other works have influenced the who's who of the literature world. However, I haven't really understood the reason for the magnitude of importance ascribed to this work. Vladimir Nabokov in his notes says, ""If Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" strikes anyone as something more than an entomological fantasy, then I congratulate him on having joined the ranks of good and great readers."". It does strike me as more than an entomological fantasy, but I'm still missing something. Perhaps, there are more symbolisms to be uncovered, perhaps I need to read it a few more times, perhaps I need to understand Kafka's background better (I did read a bit about his relationship with his father), perhaps...?"
2,Unfufilling,"After all the hype, yes hype, surrounding this supposed classic, after trying to read it, I had to stop after only 1/3 of the way through due to the rambling diatribe I found myself engulfed in. I think that most of the praise for this story is unfounded and ill-placed; mostly due to academics who try to justify their own meager ramblings. The Metamorphosis is boring, superficial, and trite. Do not waste your time if you value it."
2,Not for me,"Kafka's Metamorphosis is not for me, the story too surreal, the alienation too alien and the plot too far-fetched and depressing without any space for redemption. While recognising Kafka's genius, this story only confirms that Kafka is indeed not for me.Stories should have wonderment, should transport, sweep away, allow the reader to identify. For me personally a story that doesn't evoke any kind of emotive reaction or involvement is quite wasted. Reading this classic I felt nothing."
3,"Not bad, not great","Metamorphoses isn't one of the worst books I have read, but it certainly isn't one of the best books I read either. I found the psychological aspects and how it related to his life more interesting than the plot itself. I recomend reading a little bit about Kafka's life so that you can understand the psychological aspects and how Kafka uses Gregor to show some of his own feelings."
4,The Bug Life,"This book really makes any reader think, there is several dimensions to this piece of writing. Gregor wakes up one morning to discover that he is an insect, the stresses of his life start to fall down upon him making his family turn their back and ignore him. Several questions arise if you examine the book, is Gregor really an insect? Or is it just symbolism surrounding something else. This is a short novel that I would recommend on reading, its definitely worth your time."
3,A well descripted metaphor for the dieing process.,Metamorphosis is a book that has been written about the dramatic change one man must go through. It relates to all the pain his family must endure as well as he must endure physically and mentally. The whole book is written as a metaphor in relation to his terminal illness. The book starts in action when he awakes to dicover he is not well anymore. I thought that this was a very descriptive story. It allows you a visual picture of what is going on. I recommend this book to anyone who likes dramas.
1,Not like new,"When I bought this book, the description said it was nothing like that. I was like very used and even with the name of the previous owner written. I would not trust this sellers."
3,Huh?,"I read this book in high school, but decided to take a fresh look since my son has to read it for his summer reading. And I just don't get it. What is the point?"
2,"what a long, boring, and pointless story","This story is the most boring, most pointless story I have ever read. I guess this is because Franz Kafka thought that life was boring and pointless. But still, it's stupid. He spends five pages telling about how little Gregor gets out of bed. Really, is that necessary? The only reason I would suggest it to anybody is if you haven't graduated high school yet. It is helpful to have at least read the story once in your lifetime, preferably before you leave high school, because you'll probably encounter discussions/assignments later on in college that deal with it. But it's a bad story, period."
2,over-all it is weird.,"I did not find this novella very amusing, i only had to read it for a research paper.If you don't want to waste alot of your time, then don't even pick this one up!"
4,Odd and Agreeable,"Most of my reading time is consummed in the world of non-fiction, but I picked this book up on advice of a friend, and found it to be most enjoyable. A reading group or a college instructor would have been helpful to ellucidate upon the symbols in this novella, but I believe it fits well with other books, works of art, and ballets produced during this time that grapple with the modern world, and its dehumanizing qualities.Indeed, the discomfort of Gregor's transformation seems indicative of the discomfort felt when the human heart is wedged into a world of machines, numbers, and efficiency standards. However, apart from this symbolism, I most enjoyed the lucidity of Kafka's prose and the structure and design of his story. Metamorphosis is the perfect form of a short story."
5,Very entertaining,This book is one of the most creative short stories of the 20th century. It's reminiscent of Greek tragedy.A quick read and an excellent book.
3,NOW WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO A GIANT INSECT,"I was very eager to read to book. I think it might be fair to say that this is probably Kafka's most referred to book. To me the story starts out great,I was even laughing at the sitution Samsa found himself in. But I'd say 20 or 25 pages into the book it actually gets boring! The whole sitution starts to get ""stale"". You begin not to care about the character and just want to stop reading it all together! I don't mean to bash the book completely, it is very well written,but lacks fire after a while. NOT THE WORST THING I EVER READ,BUT YOU COULD DO BETTER!"
4,Ultimate betrayal of a family,"this novel starts out as an unreal, disgusting idea of a man waking up as a bug. but it actually ended up being sad. overall good work."
2,I found that this book was extremely boring,"I am sorry, but I must say that this book was a waste. Kafka's writing style, grammar, ability to portray the characters. etc. is excellent, but nothing ever really happened. Kafka spends the whole time describing how Gregor feels and the family's reaction. This is a key point for anything extraordinary, but not important enough to focus the idea into a full book."
2,"Boring, Slow Moving Book",I feel that the story was rather boring and the only reason I read the whole book was because it was a school assignment. I dont recomend reading this book unless it is the only book left in the world and you have nothing better to do than read.
4,cool little story...you probably wont get it,"I really enjoyed reading this...it is definatly a book that is not only a good read, but a great book to read into... my favorite type of book is one that makes you think, and makes you think of all kinds of parallels in the real world to help you make sense of the story, and i came up with some very interesting ones for this story, and had a good time thinking about them...i bet very few people truly get this book, its a lot like the film joe vs the volcano (strange analagy i know, unless, your cool and know what im talkin' bout)..most people will think its just silly but there are tons of deep truths about life within them...joe is a little more upbeat, but the ending of M is a happy one i think, well, sort of..."
1,Don't see what all the fuss is about.,"I don't see anything philosophical, moral or intelligent about this book. It's a boring, nonsensical story that has no point and on top of that is an excellent example of extreme ennui. If anyone other than the intellectual, snob critics' pet ""Kafka"" had written it it would have been flushed down the toilet where it deserves to be."
5,I can't believe there's people who talk bad about this book.,"I mean, all those people below who say that ""it's boring"" ""I read it 'cause it was an assignment from school"" and all that, I don't think they understand it at all. This book is a simple, easy and short story with a great background. What you got to read here you got to read it between the lines, while amusing yourself with the story of Samsa.Actually the first time I read it it was an assignment from school, and I've read it twice more since then. A very enjoyable book."
1,Too basic.,"I found this 'pamphlet' too basic to be useful for someone without any training. Anyone with even minimal training should go for one of the advanced books, especially if your sailing included any offshore."
2,Not as well-written or insightful as it might have been,"Someone needs to write an updated biography for Paul Newman and do better justice to the life of this interesting and talented man.A cheap, outdated paperback, few photos to speak of, and the used copy I received was only in ""fair"" condition."
2,"Plenty of information, terribly written","This book does have lots of information about Paul Newman's life. However, it basically reads like one, 350 page wikipedia article about him. It is very disjointed. If you want to learn a lot about Newman's life, you could certainly pick this up, but I'd recommend looking for a different biography."
3,Paul Newman,"Excellent, large picture book with great narrative about one of the greatest actors. I highly recommend this book. The pictures are large, color, black and white - beautiful."
4,Good Overview of British Generalship in WWII,"This book provides a good introduction to the British Army Generals of the Second World War and the theaters in which they served. Each essay is a concise, well written look at the men who fought the Axis powers while at the same time had to deal with rivalries within their own service, dealing with the American and French allies, and had to contend with the dominating personality of Winston Churchill. Generals Slim and Wingate perhaps come off as the best British fighting generals of the war, battling the Japanese in Burma with intelligence and ability. Montgomery comes across a bit more sympathetic than American students of the war are used to seeing him. In all, Keegan has assembled a group of first-rate historians to provide these portraits."
5,A Culinary Masterpiece!!,"Dear Amazon readers,'I am the proud owner of Helen Corey's cookbook Healthy Syrian and Lebanese Cooking. This is truly an interesting culinary masterpiece as Helen goes into the description of Middle Eastern customs and cultures. Her easy to follow instructions on preparing these foods will enable any novice to becoming an excellent chef and I have become one of them. From Tabooley to Baklawa, this is a mouth watering adventure into unveiling the best food flavors of Syria and Lebanon. I'm headed to my kitchen now to make the healthy Tabooley salad as written in her book. I've already made her easy to make Yogurt in my microwave and I get raves on it from my friends. Thanks to Helen for keeping up our culture.'Chuckie ShahadeyFt. Lauderdale, FL"
5,Healthy Syrian and Lebanese Cooking: A Culinary Trip to the Land of Bible History - Syria and Lebanon,"Helen Corey does extensive research prior to having her books published, and the background information contained in these books is factual and the recipes authentic.Helen is a knowledgeable, dedicated author."
2,Look elsewhere,"This is the first Ramones CD I bought. The first 10 songs are good, but the live versions aren't that good. And that's a shame considering that their best songs, including Blitzkrieg Bop, Sheena is a Punk Rocker, and Teenage Lobotomy are only in Live version on this CD.You'd be much better off getting ""Loud fast Ramones: Their toughest hits."" That's a great compilation for any Ramones fan, and it contains better songs. This compilation is very passable."
2,mangal pandey dvd seems to be incomplete,"Aamir Khan's Mangal Pandey is an interesting film version of the 1857 rising in India. However, this DVD is advertised as having two discs, the movie and a disc of extras on the movie and The Rising. I ordered the movie twice from Amazon and twice received copies with only one disc in DVD cases that held only one disc, event though the price ($29.99) was for two. The problem may be with the supplier, but the problem was never resolved. So check your order carefully."
2,dissatisfied.,"I received the order, but found the case broken. Although I ordered a new one, I have a feeling I received a used one. However, I have decided to keep it because it is not worth returning."
2,good and bad,"I thought that the sections on RFK and JFK would be a good read for the novice reader. There is little new evidence, but Smith covers the main issues in a readable way, without the difficulty of proving each assertion (as they have been proven by previous authors).However, the chapters covering Ted Kennedy/Chappaquiddick were disjointed at best. Smith offers no theory of what happened to Mary Jo, and it is difficult to understand the movements of all the players.The section on Tippit's murder was interesting, but it is difficult to understand that ""they"" would send someone unreliable to drive Oswald to the airport, but at the same time have a gunman ready to kill Tippit if he didnt follow the script. Why not find a reliable driver instead?Those two portions of the book make me suspect of the Marilyn Monroe information. I am not as familiar with the circumstances of her death, and Smith's telling is not convincing.My conclusion is that there is too much speculation."
4,Into the Heart of the Storm,"Rob goes into Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan war, and realizes how plastic and robotic his life is.There he falls in love with Afghanistan...the people, the land, the animals. Rob goes on to chronicle many parts of the war, from 1984-1987. The really unique piece, was the eye witness accounts of men and figures that I have read about in texts on the war.This in itself could have carried the book; but he goes on to do more. For those of us sleepwalking through life, many will find this book a breath of fresh air. The book chronicles his many adventures, tales of the absurd, his fear of being killed, his bouts of depression, and the many hilarious situations that can only occur in war-time Afghanistan.I think Rob found a piece of his soul in Afghanistan and in turn, he allows the reader to witness some of it. I for one, thank Rob for the oppurtunity."
4,Just Like on TV,"Can those guys with the weird hats and AK's living in the dirt on TV be real? Smiling all the time. Just for the cameras or what? Well, this book is evidence that those TV people really are real. They really do smile all the time. They laugh at stuff that would prove your insanity on this side of the planet. But over there it's really - different - and more real than just about 100% of our lives. And apparently it's not possible to go there just once."
4,"Not their strongest, but very good.","An avid Cranmberries fan, and have LOVED all of their previous. This one is slowly growing on me, but the lyrics seem forced and lacking the passion of the three previous releases. Still a few really strong songs here, just not as many as on the other releases. If this is your first Cranberries experience, the other ones may surprise you...quite a bit better!"
5,"Great Music, Lyrics, and Voice!","The Cranberries continue to supply their fans with great songs that will be perfect to sing along at their upcoming tour. Animal Instinct, Shattered, and Copycat are so different in speed, rhythm, and vocal tone, but all serve the same purpose and succeed...they all get their fans to sing along, sway, jump around, and, ultimately, be happy! What a super CD. For those who gave up on the Cranberries during To The Faithful Departed....get back in the game! This one is a winner!"
3,Hypocritically average,"At this point of their descent into mediocrity it is safe to say fans cling, foes cringe, and everyone else may stand a chance to be very modestly won over. Even if some of the material can be more solidly written, plodding production disengages songwriting which mainly seeks to recreate a watered down version of glory days."
4,The Best album they ever made.,"This album ""Bury the Hatchet"" was definitely the best work by the Cranberries. I had bought all of the other albums without listening to them first, and I was really dissappointed, but this album was a whole lot better than the rest, Delores O'Riordan's voice also sounds nice too, usually she sounded really loud and annoying, but I truly believe that in this album you could call her voice RELAXING.All of the songs on this album are magnificent, especially ""Shattered"" and ""Dying in the sun"" If you are into slower relaxing music. So Go out and buy yourself a copy today, you will not be dissappointed."
1,Bury the hatchet - the worst in the world,I think this is the worst album Cranberries ever released. Too many slow bad song about nothing. Lyrics couldn't get depth of previous albums and no invention there. Really sux.
3,se merece mas que una sola escuchadita,"Como en todos sus cd's hay buenas canciones y contienen algunas que son aburridas.""just my imagination"" es una obra muy buena,tal como ""you and me"".la primera cancion""animal instinct"" tiene buen ritmo tambien.es cierto que dolores burton tiene una voz singular y el grupo es capaz de producir musica bien emocional y profundo,sin embargo, no lo logran siempre."
2,It's tough to write good lyrics from your Irish mansion,"I think Shakespeare said: Drown cats and blind puppies and that insipid album, Bury the Hatchet. tkbaird@hotmail.com"
1,A Terrible Album From A Great band,"While I generally do reviews on albums I really like, I thought I'd switch the tables and review an album I really dislike. Mind you, I am a big Cranberries fan, and have seen them in concert a number of times over the years. When I bought this album and listened to it, I couldn't quite believe what I heard. Save perhaps for ""Promises"", there really isn't quite a memorable tune that I really enjoyed after listening to it. Whatever happened to Dolores' muse? OK, she's a happy mom now, but I linger for the strength of songs found on, say, ""No Need to Argue"". Don't buy this CD. Cranberries have a lot to offer, but it sure doesn't show on this CD."
1,Minus One Star for a total of Zero,"The Cranberries might want you to believe that everything's OK now they're acclimated to success. Rather this secure and predictable move is a desperation play to return to some imaginary, womb-like safe haven among their fans. Apologizing to the world as if to say, ""Um, did you prefer ""Dreams"" over ""Zombie""? We can fix that."" The solution is to trod out a batch of re-hashed ideas and melodies from their more profitable past to simulate the experience of a band ""still in their prime"". Unfortunately not an uncommon occurance in music. The Cranberries are the Pink Floyd of the 90's."
3,#4 is not so bad...,"This is definitely an album made for those who are already major fans of the Cranberries. It very much makes use of the sound and lyrics we as fans recognize as Dolores O' Riordan. If you're just getting into them you'd be better off trying earlier albums such as ""Everyone Else is Doing it So Why Can't We?"" or better yet ""No Need To Argue"". The best three songs on this album can be found on ""Stars-Cranberries Greatest Hits"" so that would probably be the best route to take if you're not a die-hard fan."
1,"One or two good songs, but this band has seen better days.","Save yourself the cash on this one. If you liked their earlier stuff, you're likely to be quite disappointed. Their 3 year hiatus doesn't seem to have done them any bit of good, as this is, IMHO, a total display of utter lack of creativity. It's akin to U2's Zooropa: utter junk. Musically and lyrically, The Cranberries have seen much better days. I hope they will come again, because I really liked their earlier work."
1,Terrible,"While Cher goes from strength to strength poor Dolores and co. seem to be stuck in a mire, sad very sad."
1,absolutely horrible,"What happened to the days when hearing the cranberries used to make me shiver? Listening to this cd, all I could do was cringe. ""Copycat"" is perhaps the worst song I have heard since the late 70's and the rest of the songs are right up there with it. How anyone can come up with as many painfully unoriginal songs on one album and then ramble on as self-righteously as the 'berries do in this song is simply beyond me."
3,"Worth buying, but not up to par","I'm a fan of the Cranberries and I own all four albums. If you're a fan of the band, I'd recommend buying it, but it's definitely not as good as the first 2 albums. While just about every song on the 1st 2 albums is a keeper, this album is much more inconsistent. The better songs, such as Promises, Fee Fi Fo, Animal Instinct, and Saving Grace are weighed down by the lesser-quality tracks like Desperate Andy and Copycat."
4,It is Still the Cranberries.,"This album is not bad. In fact it could be described as good. Yet, it just isn't as deep, nor as entertaining as their last CD. You can sense a tone of maturity in the songs and their singer. All things put aside, the album is good, not great. And personally I do not enjoy it as much as ""To the Faithful Departed""."
3,"Not Their Best, But Pretty Good","I bought this album right when it got out and I was partially pleased. Even though the song Promises stands out from the others I did like other songs like You And Me, Loud And Clear, and Shattered. If you are a fan of the Cranberries, it might be worth buying it."
5,All the promises we heard.,"THis CD really,rewally rockz!...I meant.id be just a perfect CD with ""Promises""...BUY IT!"
5,da best!,"Cranberries is by far my favorite band and this is by far their best album! animal instinct is like perfect! promises, what's on my mind, desperate andy, each and every song has its value. it worth it! you'll love the first five songs and after a few listenings you'll love the rest of it."
5,Please write to me if you found better CD than this one.,I think it is the best album of The Cranberries. So many great acoustic songs...
3,i had expected better,"for any other artist, this would have gained more starts from me, but measured with my expectation it's three starts. i love 'animal instinct' and dolores' voice is good as ever, tbu the lyrics are so superficial and impersonal. i don't get why dolores claims she's ashamed of their last album being so depressed. It was much better than this one. Still, 'NO NEED TO ARGUE' is their best one, with every song a hit..buy that one if you haven't yet. This one is nice so far, but they're the Cranberries...you know?"
4,ENJOYABLE BUT NOT THEIR BEST.,"""Promises"" is one of the best songs the Cranberries have done. ""Copycat"" is probably the worst song they have ever done. I still enjoyed most of the album. I wish they rocked out more on the album with more songs like ""Promises""."
5,Definately a keeper!!,"When i heard Promises on the radio for the first time it immediately became one of those singles that when it came on the radio i would run to it and turn it up. Then I'd be like, "" I heard Promises today!!!!"" And so i couldn't wait for Bury The Hatchet to come out. I bought the CD after already owning two other Cranberries CD's and i know they have a great range of abilities in their music. They aren't going to be just slow, or just loud, just humble, or just angry songs on a CD. This has the perfect mix, and Dolores' singing is unbelievable! This is definately one of the best CD's they have made."
2,regression,"The Cranberries were once a band that had a mission to purge their souls of pain. Now the band is at the lofty heights of fame and success. As always at such altitude comes the unrelenting stressors of maniacial producers and record label executives who make unreal demands on the creative process. For many artists this can kill one's creativity. This has happened to Dolores.On top of that Dolores is now married. She seems to be happier. Happiness has a flip side for disturbed artists: it also kills their creativity!Hence, you have ""Bury The Hatchet"", a watered down album that is lacking in originality, added is a feeble attempt to cover up this lack of originality with the song ""Copy Cat"", which actually sums up the compilation of songs on this release."
4,Worthwhile buy,"""Bury the Hatchet"" is leaning toward a harder-hitting style, but I would say it's of the same caliber as their first album, ""Everybody Else..."". The lyrics aren't that great, but you'll find yourself humming along with the catchy tunes."
4,It's worth your money,I think this album is worth your money. and the cranberries have very pretty voices. I rate this album at 4 stars.
4,still going good,"Don't bother listening to the previous review..sure, this isn't as good as their 1st cd, but does it have to be?? I still think this is a good effort. The semi-radio ""Promises"" rocks, which is 1 of the only ones that do, but the slow tracks mixed with strings & other orchestral instruments are good, especially #4 ""You & me"", a personal favorite of mine. I really like the opener ""Animal Instinct"" too, & other highlights are ""Saving Grace"" & the last one ""Dying in the Sun"". Definitely get this cd if you like their 1st 2 cd's & you won't be disappointed....I think it's more reminiscent of ""No Need to Argue"" of the 2."
5,BUY IT NOW!!,"ITS THE CRANBERRIES,WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY..THIS CD IS GREAT!!ITS MORE MELLOW LIKE THE 1ST ONE....THE 2 SONGS THAT STAND OUT THE MOST IS PROMISES AND YOU AND ME...YOU AND ME IS A GREAT SONG!! AND IT END W/ A GREAT SONG ""DYING IN THE SUN"".... YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!! ELECTRIC BLUE IS STILL THE GREATIST CRANBERRIES SONG!!"
3,A fairly mediocre effort,"This is the kind of album that many Cranberries fans will like, but few will love. On the plus side, the group has apparently gone back to their ""old sound,"" which should please fans turned off by their last album. And some of the songs are catchy (""Promises"" and ""Just My Imagination""). Unfortunately, the rest of the album is a collection of unoriginal, forgettable songs. It is clear that little effort was put into this record. Although their previous albums haven't been 100% perfect, back then they had at least tried to do something new and expand their sound. This time they wimped out and played it safe. Bad move."
4,The Best of Cranberries,"It's very good,I like it.You listen this album... It's great and songs are very good.Exampke;Animal Instncts"
2,This is from the most devoted cranberries fan...,"OK, I have all of their albums, and I sort of notice a trend with the cranberries with each album that they release. The quality decreases, more screaming and heavy music.. What happened to the kind of songs that were on their best album ""everybody else is doing it so why can't we?"" or on their second best ""no need to argue?"" I really miss the old cranberries. When to the faithful departed came out, I was slightly disappointed.. Songs like ""I just shot Jonh lennon"", and that circus song (forgot what it's called), and just the other fast ones were kind of forced and didn't seem like them.. Maybe they are not themselves anymore. On this album there are even less good songs than on the previous. I love ""you and me"" and ""just my imagination"" but the others just don't cut it. I'll just say that this album was a let-down for me."
2,Disaster,"The best way to describe this album is to use two early Cranberries titles as a comment: ""Disappointment"" and ""Empty"". I have no future hope for Cranberries to make such wonderful music as in the first two albums. A loss."
4,Bury the Hatchet,"This album makes me proud that I stuck by the Cranberries when critics and so called 'fans' blasted the band after its previous album: To The Faithful Departed. Honestly, that album isn't their best album but you can't call it bad. Bury the Hatchet on the other hand is top quality.It reminds me of the much loved first album,which is my favourite. Just slighty not as high standard. Animal Instinct, Just My Imagination and My Saving Grace particularly refreshes my memory. If you like the first two albums. I urge you to buy this."
5,"If you love The Cranberries, you'll love this CD!","When I read some of the other reviews for ""Bury the Hatchet"" I was worried that I would not like this CD, I am so glad that I ignored the bad reviews. I have loved the Cranberries CDs ""Everyone Else.."" and ""No Need to Argue"" for years. I was disapointed in ""To The Faithful..."" but this CD feels more like their first 2 CDs which is wonderful. If you like The Cranberries try this one, you'll like it!"
2,Who kidnapped the real Cranberries?,"The Cranberries have always been a thoughtful and thought-provoking band in my eyes, but with Bury the Hatchet they seemed to have lost their skills. The first three albums are amazing, but I don't sense anything special about this one. Except for a few moments of good music (not lyrics), this album doesn't offer anything to make it listenable for any more than a week at most."
1,I don't get it!,"I expected there to be just a few 3 and 4 star reviews for this CD. After giving it another good hard listen I just don't understand why there are so many good reviews. Are listeners tastes at the end of the 20th century that damaged? This CD is pure watered-down, repetitive, unoriginal dreck! It is almost inconceivable that it was created by the same musicians who made the beautiful and enchanting EEIDISWCW. I like to imagine that it is either purely a contract fulfillment piece or some strange inside joke on their part. Either way, it is a waste of time and money as there is much better music to be had by groups that still have something left to say."
1,"Well, I used to like The Cranberries...","I bought Bury the Hatchet because I have always loved the Cranberries and I heard ""Promises"" on the radio and loved it. Unfortunetly, that is the only good song on the CD. I keep listening to it hoping I'll grow to like it, but that hasn't happened yet and I don't think it will."
3,Nice product with a couple drawbacks,"What I do like:1 - The Nifty Catch-All floor mats are designed well and fit as I would expect2 - They hold an adequate amount of water/slush/etc but there is a drawbackWhat I don't like:1 - Lack of good anchoring to the carpeting. They slide around too easily, especially the drivers mat2 - Inadequate drainage for water/slush/etc that just dumps it onto the carpeting"
2,2 for 2 bad,"I was expecting a little more from this compilation. Most of the beats and mixing seem a little amateur to me. Filla Brazillia's track is dope. A couple others maybe, but overall this album is pretty stale. Pick up Thievery Corps. album ""DJ Kicks"" instead if you don't have it already. It's a much better example of how to mix the right beats at the right time."
3,too laid back even for me,"Since I had the first 2 volumes of this series (the first is 3 stars, the second is 4) I picked this one up as well, without trying any audio samples. Honestly, I'm pretty disappointed. This is congenial and laid back a disc, with absolutely nothing standing out. The first track has a bit of spice to it, as well as track 7, but besides that it's just placid beats and occasional melodies or vocals. Lounge 2 had the great ""What's Your Number"" by Ian Pooley, the change of pace Ming & FS in the middle, and some better Fila Brazilla. This...well there are many other better discs out there."
5,Best OM compliation,"I have all of the OM compilations and, for me, this is still the stand-out. More than just your typical ""future lounge"" assortment, this has a nice range of tempos and styles."
5,"To me, TSOL's best effort....","From start to finish this album is one of my all time favorites. I don't know what the band was into when they made this recording, but this is dark, angry stuff. A manic, punked out Jim Morrrison risen from the grave."
3,It's A Shame Really,"This album is really good. a 3 and a half, but not quite a four. The sad part is that TSOL gets a lot of crap for putting their name on this album. People expect the old TSOL and this is NOT the old TSOL. I love the old TSOL and to compare it to this album is wrong. The drums are very punk but wood adds an incredible rock feel to this album. If you only listen to something if its punk don't get this. If you just like good music pick this up."

3,Not God,"I haven't had time to read it yet, good info but very slow reading. It makes some important point, not only for recovering folk, but also for all of us."
2,not God,The first part of this book was very educational the second part goes very deep into reasons and logic into how the program choose their words. I ould have been delivered in a simpler and more enjoyable way Seems the author is proud of his vocabulary
5,"Very informative, historical data galore","Very informative, little known historical data galore, kind of a hard read though, took me a while to get though it"
5,Not God,Very well done history of AA. Helps an alcoholic understand the importance of 'surrender' and of 'spiritual awakening' so necessary in obtaining sobriety.
5,Great book,"This is by far the most in-depth history I have read to date on the A.A. program. Definitely not a fast read, it is written like a textbook. I am finding it very helpful in my quest to understand the origins of A.A., and what the organization has been through to bring it to it's current state as I know it."
4,I.O.U A Wonderment,"I was just listening to this cd as I do about once a month,it never fails to totaly blow my mind. Probably because it brings back so many memory's of seeing him live in this season, I have seen alot of guitar ""gun slinger"" shows, and few have taken it to a/ the level that Allan did as far as shear genius,passion,almost leaving the music behind, to show a glimps of pure expression,and I don't meen that lightly! The exceptions would be John McLaughlin,Bill Frisell,David Torn. These guy's are all aliens! And like Hendrix and Santana,Garcia, in the 60's,They have changed guitar Forever. All hail chuck Berry... Ok, I blab, this cd really is a piece of guitar history, Allan say's it makes his teeth grind to hear it, it is not well produced, it was a shoe string budget .no matter how you slice it, it's great. The tone is Great. If you like this kind of blowing, check out Coltrane's Impressions."
4,"3M SandBlaster 21916-320 Between Coats Sanding Sponges, Fine 320","The soft pad works well on surfaces that are not flat. This is not a total replacement for sandpaper, but it is a good product."
4,Mao's War Against Nature,"Book was much appreciated. Useful for a specific research project; well written but could have had more detail, which would be difficult given the enormity of the subject. Appears to be the only reference on this issue. Would recommend it to anyone interested in one of the more insidious sides of Mao's campaigns."
5,A Breakthrough Album!!!,"""Mixed Messages"" is a masterpiece. DJ Signify (of 1200 Hobos fame) deftly blends in beats and music that you would never expect. The most important thing is that there is SUBSTANCE to this album, not a bunch of wicked scratching with dope beats. The music is entrancing, and the scratching complements its, while not overtaking it. The album for the new millenium. BUY THIS ALBUM...YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!"
5,Awesome Series!,I read these when I was elementry age and have bought thi series for my children. They are excellent! Large easy to read type and keeps kids entertained while imparting information. Well worth purchasing.
1,Untruths,"This book perpetuates that Disney myth about lemmings committing mass suicide. They don't do that. Who knows what other lies are in this book, since we know these authors weren't too particular about what they put in there?"
1,Absolute junk,"This is absolutely, hands-down, the worst computer-related book I've ever had the misfortune to read. It's also the first ""For Dummies"" book I've read, so it may be the fault of the series rather than the book.The book is poorly written and poorly edited. There are errors in the code examples and numerous inconsistencies in the text. The book doesn't really say anything except, to paraphrase, ""There are many things that you should know, but they're beyond the scope of this book. Check somewhere else.""I bought this book based on the recommendations on this page-- my mistake. I'll never buy a ""For Dummies"" book again."
3,"Good reference, not for beginners","This book has a lot of good technical data, but it's not well organized for learning, more of a reference. Also, it assumes you are already an experienced SQL programmer."
3,Okay if your in a pinch,"Standard mid range quality belt, very light, and runs small, I would recommend going one size larger, could serve in a back up roll."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I ordered my belt last Saturday and about half way through the week, it came. I am greatly pleased with the speed of the delivery. I was not expecting it for another week at least! And they got the order right. Double Points! I would without any hesitation order from them again."
3,Nice belt not so hard!,"Very nice just out of the box, but i wash it and put it on the dryer, came out with a little rip on the edge of the fabric, don't know what to think about this, maybe it was the regular cycle on the washing machine... other than that its pretty nice,it works!"
2,Brown Belt,The belt is very light weight and not a solid good belt for professionals. I would not buy this item again and have no use for it.
5,good value,the brown belt I ordered is well stitched and color fast. the size is exactly as ordered & it is sturdy and well worth the few bucks I spent on it!
1,Please: It's Fiction For Pete's Sake,"Not to burst anyones bubble but this book is a novel... and while many maintain it's based on the author's TRUE experiences I'm here to tell you that the big climax, the birth of her son, is totally bogus.1.] Martha MARTIN is the pen name of Helen MULLEN. Helen isn't even her real name as she chose to drop her given name of Orpha Myrtle. She was the first wife of my grandfather, Clyde L DeVOL. They were married 30 July 1914 in Pueblo Co CO and divorced 7 September 1925 in Cook Co IL. They had lived apart apart since 1918. Clyde came home on a ""surprise"" leave from the navy [WWI] and, as he put it, ""found her in bed"" with another man.2.] Their son Clyde E. DeVOL was indeed born in a log cabin but it was hardly in the ""wilds"" of Alaska. He was born 23 May 1915 at his grandfather's summer cabin in Iron Co MO. This nearly 10 years before his mother ever set foot in Alaska.A well written and gripping NOVEL, perhaps. Based on reality, hardly."
5,Wonderful,The kind of book that transports you out of your space and time into another person's world with their concerns. The hardships and loneliness of life in a small cabin in remote Alaska make you grateful for the comforts and loved ones in your life. And it has a happy ending.
2,Unit did not work with my Direct TV,"This unit did not work at all with my Direct TV receiver. I have a new Direct TV HD-Tivo DVR-250. It's an all in one unit. After hooking it up correctly, I could not receive any satellite signal. Removed this surge protector and everything went back to normal. I don't think it supports everything. Better check before you buy."
1,works but spike fried it,first spike my house ever had fried this product . i have know idea if this product helped or not . the spike fried an xbox that was not hooked up to a surge protector . but it should have some sort of a reset if ther is a spike.
4,I know it works!,"I recently had a noticable spike in our power that woke up my whole family. All our cable boxes went bananas except for the one I had hooked up. I have a Westinghouse LCD and the picture is a little clearer now. But I can't give it a full 5 rating only because I still don't think the price tag justifies its functionality. However, I promise you that if you buy it from amazon you will pay less!!! Best buy has this same product for 179.99 plus Taxes. Amazon had it for 102 w/free shipping. And with prime, I got it in two days. Just this purchase made the prime membership worth it. Getting stuff in two days is cool. and i didn't pay california sales taxes. sweeeet"
2,Start to produce loud humming noise after 5th years,I stopped using the HTS 1000 after 5th years. The buzzing noise which come from from the HTS 1000 is annoying.I will not buy any product from Monster cable. [...]
3,great songs poor sound quality,"what ever happened to the original master tapes? normally iwould give four and a half but the sound quality is really frustating.let us hope that for future releases of such great albums like ""disco connection"" or ""new horizon"" the original master tapes will be discovered"
4,A decent college textbook for a week's study,"The author, Roderick Nash, does a fine job in refuting the common beliefs about the 1920's. He looks beyond the hype and heroes and looks at the true culture of the era.Chapter 1 is an Introduction.Chapter 2 discusses those who popularized the decade in people's minds, and the professionals who teach about it.Chapter 3 is an overly-long chapter about the Intellectuals of the era, and their takes on war, man, democracy, nation, nature, esthetics, ethics, and existentialism.Chapter 4 talks about the mood of the people and how that affected the era's heroes, books, crusades, and fith.Chapter 5 discusses Henry Ford as being representative of the period.The book is almost a collection of separate essays, as each chapter seems to neglect that the others are there. In total, the book makes for a nice read for one week's worth of college classes, but is not deep enough for more."
3,Rent Before You Buy,"Was not impressed with the transfer of this movie to DVD. The sound and picture was terrible. Although, it was good to see the""Alice Cooper"" show from the 1970's as it appeared on stage.Now if Rhino can get ABC to release their ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" TV special to DVD, that would be great.There is also a Paul Lynde Halloween show featuring Kiss thatABC also has ahold of I wish they would release./\/etflix.com"
4,great dvd,"I just purchased this DVD and I was quite impressed with the quality.The only bummer is no snakes and gallows etc. I was expecting to see this as a reviewer said that it was in the DVD. If you haven't seen Alice,buy the DVD. I have been a long time fan of Alice and understand where he is coming from,to shock and entertain of which he does quite well I do also reccomend Brutally live his latest"
1,HORRIFIC,"the picture quality is the worst, i saw this show live and it was great but the sound and picture quality *ucks your better off with the vhs version i have both and they look and sound the same. save your money!"
1,"Welcome to ""my"" nightmare","From the very begining of the concert footage I new I had made a big mistake. The sound is awful, almost unlistenable. I am a huge Alice fan; and this is not the cliche for die-hard fans only. Look for a used copy of the video for 1/4 the price."
2,MISLEADING.....,"I bought this dvd thinking I was getting the televised show from the seventies and soon found out that although the cover led me to think this, instead I got a crappy live concert that seemed really uninspiring - therefore...not only is this dvd misleading, but it also stinks!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOR MONEY!!,"I just finished watching this DVD. IT SUCKS! I thought it was the TV Special. It was Alice Cooper's concert for the album. The video is bad. So is the audio. The cover says it's ""REMASTERED"". If this is remastered. I'd hate to see the original. If you're looking for the actual TV Special, look for the one that is under 120 minutes AND does not include his hits from the previous years as this disc does. SHAME ON RHINO FOR GIVING US THIS CRAP!"
2,"Vintage Coop, Sub-par Quality","What a disappointment. This was released as a concert movie back in the seventies, and the sound is worse than any theater you could imagine. The film is grainy, and the extras negligible. Rhino should do us a real service and find either a master negative for a reissue, or get the rights to the ABC special that aired right when the album ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" was released. It was a long form video years before MTV. Unless you're a diehard Alice Fanatic, take a pass and move to the better ""Brutally Live."""
3,Great for Alice fans but editing and camera work awful.,"I've been an Alice Cooper fan for 22 years and have owned this vid for about eight of those years. For heavy-duty Alice fans it is a must, unfortunately the concert is poorly edited, the sound quality is poor, as is most of the camera work. However, if you're looking for a true rock spectacle, one that puts Jim Morrison at his worst to shame, then this is the vid for you."
2,it's a nightmare dvd,"I am a fan of Alice Cooper since 70's and when i bought this dvd I thought to see good music and best show, the video is from 1975 and the quality is very poor, the music sounds bad and the perfomance was recorded worst.I think Alice Cooper has better shows and I hope to see one with good sound and perfomance.Este DVD esta muy mal hecho, el sonido y el show estan muy mal grabados,creo que Alice Cooper debe tener un mejor show y espero encontrar otro DVD con buena calidad."
4,ALICE,"Did Obama see this before his recent Arizona commencement address? If not, he should have if only to see the stagecraft he and his teleprompter can only HOPE to live up to! I took off a star only because the package should've included the TV Special...oh well, maybe that's for a future release"
3,Alice Cooper rock show,"The DVD cover is the same as the original album. But the TV WTMN with Vincent Price was much better then this after market rock show. For the time period it was taped, the video is OK and the sound is not as good as expected. Overall it was worth getting for the price. I would rather have the TV version."
4,Alice Cooper Good bad or indifferent,"I read the reviews on this DVD, pulled up a fence and sat on it for a bit, don't get me wrong I love Alice and have seen him live 5 times but I know Alice from trash onwards and this, well, I don't know! In the end I had a good month (thanks Y2K) so I bought it. Basically if you've got the time, a dark room and a six pack. This CD rocks ! it ain't modern rock and it aint pretty, but it is rock, and it's worth every penny. The commentary track is good and it adds to the repeat value, as if the music wasn't enough.Party on Dudes cos were not worthy !!!"
2,Very disappointing,I have been a fan of Alice Cooper for many years and bought the DVD based on the songs listed on the backcover. I was very disappointed in the quality of the live show. It was very inferior to the studio recordings. Perhaps it has some value for collectors of Alice Cooper but I was disappointed and will not watch it again. A waste of money as far as I am concerned
1,Unlistenable,I really like 'Welcome To My Nightmare' so it was a huge disappointment that the sound quality was so poor. The guitars are virtually silent. Rhino should be ashamed to admit to remastering the audio.
2,There Are Better Alternatives,"The idea of this dvd sounds great, but they don't pull it off. Alice is drunk and I can't stand his singing in this. Also, the bass is too high in the mix and the guitars are too low. The stage show is kinda cool, but Alice ruins it. Buy GTSYA Alice Cooper,Trashes the World,Brutally Live, or Live at Montreux 2005(I haven't seen Nightmare Returns). All of those shows are better than this one. However, the interview is very good on this dvd, which gives it an extra star."
3,Cooper Fan!,"Alice Cooper is one of my favorite musicians. However, this dvd is not what I was expecting. This does not mean that it is not your cup of tea. This dvd is a little on the strange side, but of course thats the way Alice Cooper is. I have given this dvd only three stars at this time but it is starting to grow on me so who knows it may yet receive five stars at a later date."
3,"Decent System, NOT 5 Star Solution","I rec'd this system. It is decent. Probally works great in small room, Dorm Room etc. Not what I would call Top of the line. Base is ok. Suround OK. I have a large family room with high ceilings. High end 42"" Flat Screen and wanted to take sound up a notch or two. I bought this system for around $250.00 and am returning it. I will look at higher end systems like BOSE etc. for better sound. Probally $750 to $1500.00 System to get what I want."
4,A lot of fun!,"This is a fun tape but make no mistake, you need to fitness ring with inner and outer padding to do it. You cannot fake it. Nothing else will really do. It is 50 minutes long and contains 4 minutes of upper body work (just 4), 26 minutes of super duper lower body work, and 6 minutes of targeted abs. There are also relevant stretches for all body parts worked. While this is not necessarily total body toning, if you are looking to tone your lower body, this is the place. It is hard and you will yell at her in places but, if you stick with it, those results will be coming!!"
2,midnighters series,"i didn't even read this book,i didn't even finish the first one.i bought all 3 and sold them to half/price bookstore. just not for my taste."
5,Good sequel,Loved the first book but I found the sequel to be a little slow. They do develop the charactersmore fully and you start to understand their own personal histories a little bit better. Stilla good reading.
5,Great Introductory Book,This is an excellent introductory text for Operations Management(OM). I highly recommend this book if you are starting to learn OM.
4,Great Price - Great Service,"100% what I expected and more, the book was in prime condition, arrived sooner than expected, and I couldn't beat the price anywhere."
4,Great Service!!,Excellent Seller. Would buy from again. Thanks for the extremely fast shipping and accurate description of the product!
1,Do not order from,I ordered a Supply Chain management book and did not receive until almost a month later. I sent multiple e-mail inquiring about my shipment and not one was responded to. I tried to check the shipping itinerary number and that was incorrect as well. I do not encourage anyone to order from this individual
3,Operations Management,We did not receive the book as quickly as we had hoped. I did have to return the book and had no problems with at at all. And a refund was issued promptly.
4,Comfortable but not great for circulation,"These are a well made, comfortable sock. But unfortuately, the tops are a bit heavy on the elastic and if you are prone to swollen legs, they cut into the calves. Still, a good sock and a good price."
5,A brief and detailed biography,"The first thing that really struck me about this particular biography on President George Washington was the large font which younger readers and older eyes will both appreciate. The author swiftly moves the reader from Washington's childhood through the death of his older brother and his marriage to Martha Custis to the French and Indian War, the various battles of the Revolutionary War and his retirement and death at Mount Vernon. The story of Washington's chopping down of a cherry tree is included, but the author points out that the incident probably did not happen and that it is a purposeful story in that it shows forth the honesty of such a virtuous hero. This is a good way to introduce young readers to biographies. The large and interesting illustrations will be sure to keep their interest."
2,3 good songs,"PEOPLE! Why buy a CD when the bands only got one hit song? I bought this CD because I heard Flagpole Sitta on the radio and loved it. I heard the CD and the only good songs were Carlotta Valdez, Flagpole Sitta, and Terminal Annex!"
2,"One good song, nine annoyingly average ones...","I have seen Harvey Danger three times in the great city of Seattle, and I am of the opinion that they DO NOT perform well live, with just one exception: ""Problems and Bigger Ones"". Unfortunately, this is also the exception on their debut album, Where Have All The Merry Makers Gone? I was extremely disappointed with their performances and their album, and I DO NOT recommend that many people but this trendy little album."
2,Not even close to decent,The only reason i gave this album 2 stars is because it had flagpole sitta and Private Helicopter on it....the rest was total garbage..no substance and a lot of it was quite morbid....Dont buy this cd
2,Don't be fooled,"Flagpole Sitta is a great song. Unfortunately, it is not representative of the bulk of this album, neither in style nor quality. The only other songs worth listening to at all are ""Carlotta Valdez"" and ""Private Helicopter"", and even those are only okay. Skip it; wait until FS appears on some MTV compilation or something."
5,This CD Rocks,"I love this CD! It is so cool. I especially like the song:""Flagpole Sitta"" That is a totally cool song."
4,Harvey Danger Couldn't Be More Merry,"Harvey Danger's CD is by far an awesome advance in alternative rock. Flagpole Sitta, being his top hit, is all the rage. If you like alternative music, Harvey is a must!"
4,Best thing to come out of Seattle...,"I was not really moved that much by the early-90s ""grunge"" genre, but I like Harvey Danger and their 1998 ""Merrymakers"" album. The album has its weak spots, but is still pretty good with songs like the radio smash ""Flagpole Sitta"". Album Highlights: ""Flagpole Sitta"", ""Problems and Bigger Ones"", ""Jack The Lion"", ""Old Hat"", ""The Terminal Annex"", ""Wrecking Ball"", ""Radio Silence""."
3,Probably should have bought the single.,"I love Flagpole Sitta but frankly am dissapointed in most of the rest of the CD. I play about 3 tunes, the rest are throwaways..."
3,"Doesn't live up to the success of ""Flagpole Sitta""","Harvey Danger writes great songs, but most aren't presented as well as the extremely catchy ""Flagpole Sitta"". Most are slower paced. If you like Liam Neeson of Oasis, Sean Nelson's is very similiar in the vast majority of songs. However, just for ""Flagpole Sitta"", this CD is worth the money. That song is great and if they stick with that formula, they will enjoy a long career with much success!!!"
3,Above-Average Album,"""Flagpole Sitta"" is the finest track on the album -- and one of the best singles of the year. About half of the album is pretty good. ""Jack the Lion"" deals with a serious subject in a humorous manner. ""Private Helicopter"" will make you laugh. ""Problems and Bigger Ones"" and ""Wrecking Ball"" are solid. The background music detracts from the lyrics and the overall good vocals of Sean Nelson. You should give this CD a listen before dropping $10 on the counter, because it might not be for you."
2,Disappointing,"I have always loved the song ""Flagpole Sitta"" and had heard great things about this CD, so I finally bought it. I have to say that I don't understand what all the fuss is about. I didn't really like any of the songs beyond ""Flagpole Sitta"". Some of them drone on and on.I'm new to Harvey Danger other than the couple of singles that have been on the radio over the years (""Flagpole"" and the remake of English Beat's ""Sooner of Later"", which I like better than the origianl), so I had no other context to consider Harvey Danger's music. Needless to say, I didn't find anything that made me want to delve into it more."
2,A CD destined to leave you humming it's one good song.,"Harvey Danger's Where have all the Merrymakers Gone is not a fantastic CD, but it does not suck either, I personally found only one song ""fFagpole Situp"" to be of my liking, but the rest of the United States does not see it my way. If you are looking for a cd with many great songs, skip this, and instead, buy the cd single, Flagpole Situp, also by Harvey Danger. The mediocre cd will leave you humming for hours, yet does not show any musical genius"
1,"The Merrymakers fled this horrid ""music""!","Being from the Pacific Northwest I follow the Seattle scene rather closely, and I always wonder why the rest of the country seems to pick up on the absolute worst bands to come out of that city. Harvey Danger is repetitive, annoying, and unimaginative. Not to mention WAY overhyped. If you want to be cool because you listen to Seattle music, then go up to that little search box in the corner and type in ""Goodness"" One listen to them and you'll see everything Harvey Danger did wrong. I am on an e-mail discussion group for Goodness, and there's more than one person on there who saw Harvey Danger back when they were periodically getting laughed off the stage. That was only a few years ago. It should still be happening now."
2,You call this music?,This is the worst CD that I have ever bought and I have bought a lot of CD's. I got it because I liked Flagpolesitta' and what I got was trash. I like the sound of an old man coughing more than this album. The only good songs on this album are Flagpolesitta and private helicopter. There are other songs that could pass for ok. I tried to listen to this album many times thinking that it would get better. It did not. Do Not Buy This Album!
4,Excellent Album,"Like most others, my favorites are Carlotta Veldez, Flagpole Sitta, Problems and Bigger Ones. I also really liked Jack the Lion. The singers voice is great, but sometimes the guitar seemed a little too hard."
4,New artists are the best!,"I've seen these guys in concert in their home state and although this CD is fabulous, I loved them on stage too. It's a must for anyone who loves up and coming local bands, or just small bands in general."
4,A great debut,"Throughout the history of music, there have been many great alternative albums, but lately, the offerings have been very mediocre. I was very impressed with the quality of the songs on this album. Some songs are just so catchy that they won't leave your head for the whole day. The best song is probably ""Carlotta Valdez""(I am learning it on the guitar) and the whole album in general should be listened to. Another great reasont rock album is Fuel's Sunburn."
2,Flagpole Sitta and.... not much else,"Flagpole Sitta is such a catchy tune, But it's really the only song worth hearing on this disc. All the lyrics are funny and witty, yes, but only the lyrics. the songs themselves are irritating. You'd be Much better off with Harvey Danger's superb and entertaining ""Little By Little"" and then just buy the Flagpole Sitta single.This disc leaves a lot to be desired"
3,Average CD. Flagpole Sitta is rockin' though!!!!,"If your idea of a music group is stunning rock with a twist of lyrical humor, this CD is for you!"
2,i thought it would be a lot better,"i was surprised, i loved flagpole sitta, i listened to it all the time, but i found the rest of the cd to be not as exciting and not as fun to listen to."
4,Great fun for Preschoolers!,"Even though this book is for age group 4-8, my 3 year old loves it. She gets a kick out of trying to figure where Pete is and she gets a decent snack out of the adventure!"
2,I feel misled,"When I saw a new release by Bryn Terfel, I was very excited. He is the brightest new male voice I have heard in many years. But when this CD arrived, I found that I was listening to Bryn Terfel at twenty--not Bryn Terfel at 35. While Bryn Terfel at twenty was a pleasant voice, he had not developed the depth of tone or the control of dynamics that mark his work today. Had I known that the recording was fifteen years old, I probably would not have bought it. I will continue to search for more recordings by this great singer, but I hope not to be misled again."
2,Don't understand Welsh!,"If I had known the entire disc was all in WElsh, I wouldn't have ordered it as I do not understand one word of it. Terfel has a wonderful voice, but it is difficult to enjoy an entire disc when one doesn't understand it."
5,Great Gift,I purchased this serving set for a family member as a gift and we both are pleased with the quality. A variety of styles and languages are offered which I loved.
5,About as hip an early music recording as you could imagine,"A radio station today played Michael Praetorius' Dances from Terpsichore, and remembering I had this very very funny treatment of early music, I listened to this again. It is every bit as melodic when it's serious, with all the right instrumentation (recorders and such), but then every once in a while it takes these strange, surprising turns which make you laugh. It's not as silly as, say, PDQ Bach -- no, it's actually pretty earnest -- it's just that they weave in all these other types of music, and instruments (although they never go electric -- maybe the buzz saw is an electric one, but there are also gasoline buzz saws, right?)."
2,No coffee flavor / high calorie count,"I really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the ""base"", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.I will try a different brand next time. I'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor I've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&TL;) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)!"
4,Underrated Crime-Courtroom Story,"More often that not, I'll call a movie overrated, but this one, I think, is underrated. It features solid acting and a very involving story. I'm sorry there are less than 10 reviews here by 2009. I guess most people don't share my high opinion of this film.There isn't as much violence as most modern-day crime movies and that's fine because this story doesn't need it. The profanity is also lower-than-normal. All that's missing is better cinematography.Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Armand Assante, Gabriel Byrne and William Hurt all make this interesting and provide good performances. This is a good ""date movie,"" too. It's tense, yet without a ton of the usual overdone violence and profanity."
5,"""Too Much Tampering Going On!""","Better than average performances by all the players. Kathleen Quinlin does a great job playing a part that is very far-afield from most of the parts I have seen her play. The gorefest in the park is a little unbelievable, but played well. Stuart Whitman was a sight for sore eyes as the father. Gabriel Byrne is believable and stellar as the prosecutor, very good, prosecutorial charisma, etc. I should have seen the movie when it was first released to get the full enjoyment of what were then, very elegant women's costuming. These outfits are slightly humorous in retrospect. It is still a very entertaining movie."
1,Horrible,"My wife and I had to shut this one off after the first 20 minutes. The characters were uninteresting, the plot slow and whew!!"
2,Easy listening,"The Minnesota Orchestra under its director Eije Oue has a marvelous set of musicians, but in my opinion they made too many records in the last years. Although none of the pieces on this record is really bad, with the exceptance of Otto Klemperer's Merry Waltz, the common denominator is popularity, the wellknown showpieces that lack the element of surprise. Liszt's Les Préludes is played adequately, but lacks the intensity of The Philadelphia Orchestra under Wolfgang Sawallisch (Water Lily Acoustics) and the Boléro by Ravel misses the jazz-influences Ravel intended.The sound quality of this Reference Recording is outstanding, as usual."
5,Great entertainment,"I grabbed this off the library shelf because I was on my way to the post office and needed something to read while I stood in line. As it turned out, the line was short, but I kept reading when I got home. This is my first Jake Hines and I didn't feel lost. I liked all the characters and the fact that it took awhile to sort them out. The detecting was excellent and the pace perfect.Only slight quibbles: Jake is awfully nice, but then I was glad to read a non-hardboiled detective. On the other hand, I wasn't completely convinced he was a guy. I mean I accepted that he was a guy and had a girlfriend, but as a guy he was almost too good to be true, what with how nice he treated everyone.That said, I plan to start with the first book and read my way through all of them."
2,Not the best biography for this age group,"This book was not ""readable"" enough for its target audience. It seemed like it was for an older, maybe even adult, audience. I'm unaware of another biography on Amy Carmichael for this age group (besides the series on heroes of the faith), so I was disappointed that it did not meet my expectations."
3,"better than average,","I don't know why some people did not like this movie.I did. The story is abouta submersable the ""Siren 2""with a crew that is searching for the ""siren 1"" a lost submarine.they discover a under water cave filled with mutants and monstersthat are the results of genetic engineering. Soon they start to kill off the crew in gory deaths. interesting story and good special effects are what make this above average monster movie work. rated R for gore and profanity."
3,FLORA AND FAUNA FREAKS,"ENDLESS DESCENT isn't so bad when you remember that it was made in 1989, when CGI special effects weren't being used and budgets for movies like this were restrictive to say the least. With that in mind, this movie is okay. Jack Scalia is macho and effective; R. Lee Ermey repeats his drill sergeant persona; and Ray Wise who would later be the killer of Twin Peaks' Laura Palmer is effectively villainous in his deceptive role.We've become so used to todays marvelous effects, it may be hard to appreciate movies that had yet to reach this pinnacle of excellence. ENDLESS DESCENT offers some fairly despicable monsters and even if its derivative and predictable, it's mildly entertaining."
5,Saw the Show - Had to have the music,This is the only CdS show I've seen live. I've seen the videos of some of the other shows and seeing the show live is by far the best way to experience a CdS show.
4,The Storyteller is here!,"I, like several other reviewers, saw ""La Nouba"" in Orlando this summer. I will tell the novices to this album: if you haven't seen Cirque du Soleil, then the score may appear to be a bit off. ""La Nouba"" takes the fantasy of the European circus and mixes it with the urban legends (hence, the rapper in the title song. I've seen the production only once, but the more I listen to the score, the more I envision the acts.On Dessy Di Lauro...when I heard the first- and I do mean the FIRST- three seconds of her voice, I looked for her all over the theatre. Being an African-American woman, I knew. I KNEW. I all but stood up with my hands raised to the heavens and cried out, ""Sing ON, sister!"" Her voice is an instrument of preaching, prayer and salvation.You have to see Cirque du Soleil through the eyes of a child. You can't have adult trials and tribulations in the theatre, and you must be as open when you hear this music. It WILL touch you."
5,"Great Music, Great for a band show","Here in Wisconsin, my son's band (Greendale High School) used the music for their 2005 marching band show. It's an absolute fantastic score for band, creating an excellent balance for woodwinds, percussion, and if done right, featuring both high AND low brass.With this music, Greendale took first place in the class AA competition at the state competitions held in Whitewater, WI. In addition, they also nabbed three of the four caption awards (Best Musical Presentation, Best Percussion, and Best Visual Presentation).During ""Urban"", the band broke out in a wild dance break, which was pretty cool and fun to see.While I suspect this selection of music may end up getting over-done by many bands (similar to ""Pirates of the Carribean"" a year ago), it's a great band show. I highly recommend it to students and parents alike. The kids had a BLAST playing this music."
5,Excellent,"If you like Cirque Du Soleil music you will like this, Especially since the La Nouba show is one of the best out there."
5,wow,"wow i think this would be really fun to play for a marching band show. i myself play french horn and i think it would be really fun and a huge contrast from what we usually play.we're using the first one (Once Upon A Time) for our winter colorguard show and we're very excited. everything is going to focus in on corners (if you listen, at the beginning of the song, the little boy refers to corners) we're using dark colors in our theme, and i can't wait to start performing!"
2,There are better productions,"This production basically takes a look at van Eyck's Ghent Altar which is Belgium's most prized relic. During the Second World War, this piece changed hands numerous times, and was moved from place to place. The story of this art treasure's startling journey is presented in a rather disjointed fashion here. The focus is not merely on Ghent's Altar as underlying it is Hitler's great quest to gather all of Europe's great art in a museum in his hometown of Linz, Austria. It also addresses Stalin's plunder of of German art collections. It is worth a look but there are better books and production on the theme of looted artwork during WW II and their fate:The Rape of EuropaThe Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in HistoryRescuing Da Vinci: Hitler and the Nazis Stole Europe's Great Art - America and Her Allies Recovered ItThe Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War"
2,Hitler's Museum,"Overall disapointing documentary. One of those that use the same ""re-inactment"" footage over and over and over. The Ghent Altarpiece stuff is good. ""Rape of Europa"" is a far better one on the subject."
2,Less than stellar,"This is effectively two different shows on one DVD. The second builds on the first, but includes some of the same material already covered in the first, so if you are watching both it is tedious.The format did not cover the material as coherently as I had hoped for; the presentation jumped around a good bit, so at times the order things happened in wasn't as clear as it could have been.I was also disappointed in the lack of depth in the material. While it did cover the Ghent Altarpiece, that was not what most of the time was spent on; it was almost a second thought. Overall the lack of cohesion was a serious problem. Sections were quite good, but overall it was most disappointing."
2,DVD - Hitlers Museum,The program lacks any of the required organization that surely most have preoccupied Hitler as to how the stolen property was to be centrally gathered and eventually exhibited.
1,Make Your Own Book,Go through the text.... get the main ideas and take out words and leave blanks.... get someone to lay it out for you and POOF! You just saved some money. Our singles group used this book and it was so boring dry. The information is redundant. The points are decidedly masculine. Gee! I wish I hadn't bought it. I bought it at my church but thought I would warn others!
1,Didn't work with AT&T Uverse Receiver,"The IR transmitter doesn't work with my AT&T Uverse receiver from Cisco (Model IPN430MC) and when I tried getting help from technical support, they never replied. Their web-based help ticket system is totally worthless. I bought it too long ago to return and I can't seem to get any help, so it's now just a spiderweb of useless wires in my cabinet. If you have a Uverse box, don't buy this repeater."
3,Not for Dish remote,"I only gave this three stars because it doesn't work with may Dish Network remote. It probably will work with most other remotes. I bought an identical item for Sewell Direct, but returned it and choose their 29311 model. It's a dual band unit. Sewell tech said it will work sat and cable remotes."
3,ok,"set up was easy but despite being ir/plasma/sunlight proof (per manufacturer's website) it does not work very well. in the room it is about 15-20 feet from the main sitting area. you have to aim the remote (harmony 880 is what we are using) precisely at the eye or you get mixed results. by contrast, the xantech that we have in another room works flawlessly. i guess you get what you pay for."
5,A Fitting Farewell,"I am a rock/popster. What am I doing here you may ask? Well I listen to music for the melodies and this man was the master of sublime uplifting music. But this requiem differs from the masters usual light happy arrangements . Angels hovered over the bed of the great man as he breathed his last while dictating his final piece to his student. ( so the story goes ) Full of darkness and seriousness and strength , Mozart was understandably nervous about his impending doom and the requiem represents this . After breathing his last, the piece was apparently finished by Mozart's student Sussmayer and while perfection is left to the man 's own parts, his friend and student did stay true to Mozart's intentions as well as he possibly could . A fitting and sometimes even scary farewell from ( in my opinion )the most ingenious composer of all time . Mozart took a peak at the heavenly realms and translated the beauty into his music . The voice of God ? Oh yes absolutely ."
4,A wonderful performance of a true masterpiece,"This version of Mozarts Requiem is one of the best I have heard in a long time. Although it was recorded with period instruments, it is a great version. It has a wonderful sound quality to the CD and the singers sound absolutely angelic and smooth. You can feel Mozart's terror when he was writing this piece. It is an incredibly emmotional experience and this CD was well recorded. The singers voices are very excellent and clear. I recommend this version of Requiem, especially if this is your first time listening or buying Requiem."

5,verbatim hard drive,This is the second verbatim portable hard drive that I have bought both have performed flawlessly. This first one is carried around with me so I can show off my photography. It has performanced so well for me that I downloaded the picture from a wedding to it for the bridge and groom.
1,Does not work for MacBook Pro,"As others have noted, this product simply does not work with the MacBook Pro. Even after purchasing the AC adapter, my MacBook will simply not recognize this product. May be fine with PCs, but avoid all Verbatim hard drives if you are a Mac user."
1,Smart-Disk Bad Decision,"I Purchased one of these drives for me and my wife. Hers broke a month after teh warranty of a year expired. I called them, they said it is a fatal error and it has happened to other people,because it was over a year they will not do anything about it."
5,fantastic,"If you want to draw faces and it doesn't get to the heart I mean, when you can not exactly describe the soul of the model just reach out and dig this book You could learn to snatch the delicate and subtle difference between masterpieces and junks of paper & carbon"
5,extremely well done,"This book explains what is behind the scenes in the human face, in terms of muscles and bones. It looks at things from every possible angle. It shows how different emotions create different facial expressions. It shows how faces change as they age."
1,Caution! Terrible Print quality makes illustrations useless!,"I was VERY disappointed by the print quality of this book and returned it.This is an art instruction book yet the art was so poorly represented that it looked like the book was a photocopy of a photocopy.There was no way to distinguish values or even get a good idea of what the illustrator was trying to express in the drawings.Since my purchase, I have found out that many people have this problem with the book, and that the first printing (hardcover edition) is much better. I have not seen the first edition and it's only available through used book sellers.So good luck, and as for my review, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AT ALL FOR ANYONE SERIOUSLY STUDYING ART FOR THE REASONS ABOVE.~Laura"
5,A Favorite!,"The Artist's Complete Guide to Facial Expression by Gary Faigin is one of my favorite art books because it isn't limited to a particular medium. My goal as an artist/illustrator is to portray people as realistically as possible, and this book is filled with hundreds of pictures of expressions along with the facial muscles that produce those expressions. The demonstrations show the artist how to portray even the subtlest emotion. But this book isn't just for artists whose style is realistic; artists who prefer cartooning can also benefit by understanding how to translate complex expressions into simple lines."
1,its made in chaina,"hiwhen i bought this watch i thout it is orginal , but the surprice happens when i open it and i found that it is made chaina , is it replica watch or origonal?please advice ....thanksanwar"
1,5 year warranty not enough!,After 6 years my HTFS 1000 is buzzing so loudly I have had to pull it out. Monster is no help - 5 year warranty of course! Plan to replace this every 6 years if you buy it!
1,Stinky Soap - PHEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This product STINKS, produces no suds, and because of the shape, is awkward to use. It is extremely round and big so it is hard to get a grip on the product. In addition, it produces no suds! I've tried using it directly on skin, with a washcloth, with a sponge, and there are no suds!! Does it even clean???? It stinks to boot - never smelled mint chocolate like that - PHEW!!!!! Complete waste of money."
2,Poor quality,"I expect better quality from Mead. This notebook's cover pages and spiral binding is weak and flimsy. I bought these from Amazon and Fivestar notebooks from another store. The Fivestar product is much more durable for being carried around in a book bag and moved in and out of lockers all day. I can imagine the quality of this Mead 3 subject notebook will not fair well under such use. The Mead products that I saw in the store were of similar if not better quality than the Fivestar. However these are not, this must be the Mead budget or recycled line. Also, the Fivestar 3 subject notebook has 150 pages (which was required on our supply list) compared to the 120 pages with Mead."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"These are a fraction of the cost of others, but when you get them you see why: the wire is thin and the covers are *very* soft and cheap; I don't imagine the covers offering protection for very long. Still a good value if you don't need standard quality covers and binding though."
1,Purchase,The product was old and had no fragrance of anykind. It went straight to the trash. This is my first bad purchase of any kind while buying products on Amazon. I would actually rate this product a -* if the rating system would allow it.
5,excellent,"The advertised price was so reasonable I decided to order 2 of each color available. I gave a set to my mother. We absolutly love these tops. They are so comfortable and the fit is just right. I have never purchased this brand before, but I would not hesitate to do so in the future."
1,Pachmayer's trapshooting with Ken robertson,This video is from 1985. It is totally out of date. Save your money. I wish I had mine back.
4,Industrial Funk,"Bill Laswell's band's 1983 release is a classic synthesis of bass-heavy funk and arty, industrial sensibilities. With depressorama song titles like ""Conform to the Rhythm"" and ""Unauthorized,"" you'd think this disc wouldn't be worth the trouble of putting it in the machine, but it's very dancy and even fun in some parts, such as the subtle irony of ""Square Dance."" Check out where all the technogoth teen idols stole their ideas."
5,Excellent book!!,"Nice treatment on stochastic processes (a lot of emphasis on Markov Chains).It has a nice level, really didactic."
5,Excellent book.,"If you want to learn about Markov Chains in a non-measure theoretic level, this book is a must-have. But you need to have something in probablity before, as you are supposed to for Markov Chains.It made no mistakes. Enjoyable. Exercise problems are good, although somewhat easier than Ross's Stochastic Processes. But the contents are definitely better.If you find this too difficult, may be you need:1. Basic probability or 2. Basic math (how to read/write proofs) 3. and Good sleep, good dinner, good shower, lots of determination/motivation, a girlfriend too maybe.Note: put parentheses on 1 and 2. :)"
2,mediocre,I found this book to be terse and unfriendly. I used this text for my introduction to markov chains class and did not get much out of it. If ur looking for a review of markov chain theory then U should consider this book. If ur looking for clear in-depth explanations and problems that are relevant to the chapters material look somewhere else.
3,Major confusion about the U.S. Constitution,"This series of books seems bent on discouraging any American family from ever taking in a foster child. This book is no exception.The plot is fairly lame - condors at the Grand Canyon are ending up with lead shot poisoning. It turns out they are eating corpses of animals being mass-killed and dumped. Malcolm, the foster child, is a computer hacker, and he works to save the day. But first he posts ugly information about his foster sister. Just lovely.All through the beginning of the book, Malcolm excuses his rude behavior by saying, ""free speech."" No, son: Bad manners. Free speech has nothing to do with it. And believe it or not, veterinarians do not propose new gun-control laws in America by holding press conferences. Give me a break."
3,Great series,The series is great for about a tween to teen age group. My children have both enjoyed this book and they are 7 years apart in age.
5,Very Comfortable & pretty too!,I forget I have them on sometimes and whenever I wear them &wherever I go I always get compliments! NICE :-)
4,Cheap and pretty!,"So this is my first cuff earring (I've been dying to get one so I'm pretty excited), and I don't know if it's just because I'm still learning how to wear it (hard to get on when the gap is smaller but tends to slide down a little on my ear when the gap is bigger) but I am having some minor issues. Even so, I love that it was so cheap and because the metal bends easily so I can adjust it. I think it's very pretty, and once it's on, it's very comfortable, and I completely forget it's there."
4,"4 and a half stars, actually...","From his homeland of Auvergne, Jean-Louis Murat, the savage one, gives us twelve songs loaded with some of its finest moodswings and rainy-days melodies. Dolorès is the album where he is as its most heartfelt and pastoral, singing about love and stuff that only he really understands about. A man of few words, Murat manages to speak the depths of his soul with cautiously chosen words and crush your heart with it.Still the kind of man to roam his blues in his unique countryside gentleman allure, Murat is a one of his kind artist, one that can appeal to those who like Scott Walker or David Sylvian and since Dolorès is one of the most essential albums he ever released, it makes for a suitable introduction to a great singer/songwriter."
1,One of the worst singers ever!,"Very ordinary voice is unappealing to begin with. What makes it worse is that the singing is pitchy. If she were an Idol contestant, she wouldn't make it past the auditions.Skip this!"
1,Really is a dare!,"It really is a dare to listen to this worthless single! It's better ""burned"" ad ""twisted"" (but she's definitely no angel). As someone has said in her poorly reviewed CDs, ""Tina Arena SUCKS! She's an overrated singer with a very plain voice!"" How true!And looney Derrick Lam has the gall to compare her to the brilliant and very talented international theater star Lea Salonga? Oh puh-leez! She's no better than trash on Ms. Salonga's shoes!"
5,Wonderful Dresser!,"We recieved this dresser/changing table as a gift and we couldn't be happier with it! It has a very large space on the top for the changing pad and more than enough room to keep clothing, diapers, sheets, blankets, and baby toiletries in it. It came completely assembled - I didn't even have to put the shelf in the cabinet part, it was already installed! It is very sturdy and it WILL be used for a dresser until our baby is grown. I made a similar purchase from Babies r' us when I was pregnant with my oldest child and she still uses her dresser. I didn't (and still do not) see the usefullness of purchasing a traditional changing table along with a dresser just so that the fifty to one hundred and twenty dollar changing table would become useless by the time the baby is six months old. This way, we have a piece of furniture that our child can use until she is a teenager."
2,VERY POOR JARDINE SERVICE,"We bought the entire Jardine Olympia, Lifetime crib and dresser/toy box set. We loved the looks of the furniture, but the quality is quite poor. The finish on the changing table / dresser is already coming off. Where we change our baby (who is only 3 months old), the whole front of the dresser is chipping!! I can't believe it! I contacted the manufacturer, and they said the finish is not warrantied. They're not standing by their furniture. Also, the drawers, as several people have already said, are not quality made. They are difficult to open, and they shift when closing. The tracks are poorly constructed. The one good thing I have to say is the looks of the furniture is absolutely beautiful.....UNTIL YOU USE IT! It wears quickly! We expected to keep this furniture nice for a while, considering how much we paid for the set. I would never go Jardine again after dealing with them directly, and having no luck."
3,Drawers,"Overall, I love the set. We purchased the crib and dresser/changing table. The problem with the dresser is the drawers. They are a pain, they do not glide smoothly at all, and when you are holding a baby in one hand, the last thing you want to deal with is a drawer that does not pull out easily. We went back to the store to see the drawers on the floor model and they had the same issue. So we're guessing that it is not just ours. We are going to replace the gliding mechanisms on the drawers because we do love the dresser."
3,Product Details,To Whom It May Concern:The picture is really helpful as far as color and shape however; you didn't put any information about the dimensions or the size... what's the height/width/depth of the product???How can I tell from the picture??
4,beautiful set,"I got both the changing table and the crib. I love them both, but I have come across a couple of problems with the changing table. The drawers are sometimes hard to open. I just have to pull at it for a little bit to open a couple of them. Also, I am not sure if it is because I haven't figured it out yet, but the changing table does not give the changing table pad anything to attach to. If I am doing something wrong would someone please let me know."
5,Great Nursery Furniture,"My husband and I recently bought the matching changing table and crib and love them! They are beautiful pieces and look great in the nursery. Both are sturdy, easy to assemble and will last for a long time."
3,Chipped and broken leg two times,"We ordered this changing table and when we got it home the leg is so damaged and the wood is breaking off and on the top of the table the wood is also peeling there. I wouldnt change my baby on it she might get splinters.. We are still waiting on a reply from BRU and what they are going to do about it. And all the other posts are correct about the drawers, they are horrable. For the price it's very poor quality.Update, we ordered another one and it also came in broken so now we are hoping that the 3rd time will be good."
4,Expensive Nail Clipper worth the money,"Do you really need to spend this much money for a nail clipper? Nope. But if you do have the money then might as well invest in a Wusthof Trident brand made in Solingen, Germany.Pros:1. It's very sharp - careful how deep you cut2. Folds flat - you won't believe how flat this becomes that you can store it in anywhere especiallly for travelling3. Solid and elegant feel - I've had this for years already and it's still as solid and sharp since the day I purchased it.Cons:1. Price2. Comfort - It takes a little bit getting used to since people may be comfortable in holding thick nail clippers. Because this can fold real flat, you have to find your comfort zone in holding the clippers.Overall, I wouldn't hesitate purchasing this product again. Once you get used to it, you will find storing one permanently in your travel bag."
5,Great nail clippers,They are hard to open at first. They are really sharp. My husband keeps a pair in his wallet.I love these things. I have had these for a while now and they are still just as sharp when i took them out of the package.
5,Merry Christmas to me!,"I bought this set as a Christmas present for a friend, and liked it so much I bought one for myself, too. There's some truly great music on here--the songs that make it for me are MWS's ""Place In This World,"" Jaci Velazquez's ""On My Knees,"" 4Him's ""Basics of Life,"" and Kathy Troccoli's ""Everything Changes."""
4,Body of Proof is Wonderful!,This season things really start to heat up with Dr Murphy dating Dr. Hunt's ex. Will their 'friendship' survive the turmoil? Will they... with killer viruses and people attacking them and others in the ME's office?
4,Needs closed captions,"I am reviewing Body of Proof specifically, but my remarks apply to all Amazon Instant Videos. This production is really five-star, but I have to take off a star because I am hearing-impaired and missed about 20% of the dialog. As far as I know, Amazon does not offer closed captions on any of its Instant Videos, even though the original production for cable TV may have had them. Hearing impairments are going to become far more common as the US population ages (not to mention those induced by MP3 players!). I would probably triple my purchases of Insyant Videos if they included closed captions. Incidentally, closed captions can also be useful to American viewers who are not accustomed to British, Australian or Indian accents."
4,Between Two Souls: Conversations with Ryokan,"I had never heard of the Zen monk Ryokan until I began writing Haiku. Mary Lou Kownacki and Ryokan have a deep connection with each other. This poetry is beautiful and heart rendering with great emotion. This book opened the door to Ryokan. Read ""Sky Above, Great Wind."
5,"Fantastic color, just a pictured","I love this little beanie - the color is beautiful. Most of these hand crocheted cotton beanies made in China seem nearly identical. What makes this different is the intense color. The material felt a little stiff on arrival, so I washed it first thing in a little shampoo and a whole lot of organic fabric softener. Yum!"
4,Remarkable voice,"I initially saw and heard this young lady on Celtic Woman's DVD, A New Journey,at Slane Castle in Ireland...she fit right in with these other talented women and added to the enjoyment of the concert. Haley's DVD provides a variety of song styles that she handles with ease and grace."
4,Great quality,"The video for itself is a MUST HAVE if u like Westenra's voice. She's fresh. She's nice. She has an angel that flies out of herself continosly... Not only the video quality is great if u have a DVD Home-Theatre 5.1, but the quality in Westenra's voice.I like it when u can hear little breath's in the singer voice so you make sure that there is not some studio recording behind it. In here you can have that. You can make sure with the changes she makes in her tunes that she's singing.She's simple, she's gorgeous. She's going to give you 70 minutes of a great treat. I hope she decides to come on tour soon. Maybe after one more big smash cd...But this is definitively a MUST HAVE in your collection for a tranquil evening at home and go to sleep delighted by this cristal clear voice."
5,most enjoyable,I first heard Hayley on Celtic Woman: New Journey live from Slane Castle. I have since bought several of her albums. I think she has the most pleasant and relaxing voice I've heard in a long time. She is the best. Only one song I have not enjoyed is Wuthering Heights. This is well worth the investment.
4,Hayley live,"Raw, powerful vocal talent, immature stage presence. Being 17 shows. Put this DVD in your home theater player and leave the tv off."
1,Technology lets down great talent,"It was with great anticipation I received my copy of this Haley Westentra DVD, Live from New Zealand only to be bitterly disapointed when listening to the disc. There is distortion on her voice in some of the tracks. I wrote email after email to her record label and agent with no reply. It is such a pitty that such a beautiful taleneted young lady is only as good as the useless people who represent her. Don't buy this disc if you REALLY want to listen. It is wonderfull if it's on to fill a room though."
4,Hayley Westenra-Live form New Zealanf-dvd,"Her voice limits her to a certain type of song. She haven't got a strong voice and should therefore not try to sing Opera music, etc. Most of the songs on this dvd suits her voice however there is 1 or 2 where I prefer other artists. Overall I do enjoy the dvd. The sound quality is very good."
5,As Pure as it Gets,"Kudos! A phenominal performance. This amazingly talented young lady is at her best in her native New Zealand. There are many selections from her ""breakout"" CD, Pure. This is a big plus, yet the other selections equally showcase Hayley's talents as a performer. What's next ? ""Super stardom,"" of course."
3,Book written by committee doesn't pack much punch,"I have been on a recent tear through libraries, databases and book stores to adequately research reunions of adoptees with their bioparents. One word of caution to anyone going through this same process: this book has a Canadian perspective, so contends with Canadian adoption laws. Through no fault of Ms. McColm, this is my number one complaint about the reviews that enticed me into reading this book. Another obstacle the reader must overcome is the author's overwhelming efforts to be politically correct for everyone. I felt that some of the book's honesty and integrity was sacrificed in order not to ruffle any feathers. The truth is, adoption is an issue of many, many nuances and many generations have different terms for similar things. I think the author might have been more effective if she had written from her heart and her experiences, and not been so worried about her audience."
2,Subtitle isn't accurate.,"Simply put, this book is not for birth parents, it's for the birth mother. The subtitle should be changed. The ""voice"" of the book is talking to the birth mother as the only interested birth parent, and even though some brief paragraphs refer to the birth father, he is treated not as a reader of the book, but in the third person, for example, ""What if the adoptee asks about the birth father? What should you say?"" Well, how about ""I'm him."""
3,"it's a very good product, but...","it's not the size I expected. I blame myself for getting the wrong size, but there is only one cooled side - not like my old one which has gel all around."
3,Not bad....,"I bought one to travel overseas. It worked well the first time but repeated use saw increasing diminishing ability to maintain the ""cool""."
5,Really works!,"Okay, I knew that evaporation would keep things cool, but I wasn't entirely convinced that the case would keep cool for days! It does, though, and my husband, for whom I bought this, is delighted! I am too...even when our (still new) refrigerator went out, I knew his insulin was safe and cool. That is a comfort."
2,Doesn't stay cold,"Just didn't work for me. I need my meds to stay colder. If you only need it cool, it's fine."
5,Great Buy!!,"Great! just as the buyer described, I,am a happy camper. Works great in a small purse or medical traveling bag.I highly recommend this product to carry your insulin in, it won,t take a lot of room in your purse. Ms. Willis"
1,Do Not Purchase this Junk,I purchased to keep my Byetta pen cool. I followed the instructions carefully to activate it. The gel pellets expanded but it did not keep anything cool! I REALLY WANT MY MONEY BACK! Don't buy this item.
1,Not Worth It!,I used this item in December and it worked fine. When I tried to use it again the insulation did not expand with the water and my insulin pen did not stay cool. The only thing it is good for is the trash. What a waste of money and it was not cheap!
1,Not recommended,"This product honestly just doesn't work. It may be a couple of degrees cooler than the ambient temperature, but it does not provide enough cooling to make it useful for those trying to maintain the integrity of their insulin in warm weather. It is not even close to being worth the money. I strongly recommend against it."
5,Damn The Defiant,"6 Sept 09 Sunday: This is one of Alex best movies. He shows his great acting talents to the very best!!!!!!!.. The plot is an excellent showing of the dangers of the abuse of power & the cat-of-nine tails, to open the back-bone. Dirk Borgart is the villian & he plays the part to the hilt!!!!!! It seems WAR never changes!!!! Thank you Amazon.com for your bargin $$$$$$$$ prices. A great British production. Best/Wishes Charles in So. California.."
5,"Rousing, sea tales with superior acting!!","What can you say about the powerhouse teaming of Alec Guiness and Dirk Bogarde?? Two of the greatest actors of our time. The dynamics of Guiness' Captain, controlled by a malicious Scott Pagent the first mate, played with a wicked gleam by Bogarde, is something to watch!!! There is excellent supporting work, and super battle scenes, but it is the power struggle between Guiness and Bogarde that is the sole and centre of this film.DVD only enhances that and made me feel like I was seeing this for the first time!!Wonderful historical drama, wonderful character struggle.......A definite must for fans of Guiness, the gorgeous Bogarde or historical dramas."
2,Not Exactly a Classic,I purchased this on a friends recommendation who seemed to have similiar likes in other movies. Alec Guinnes is great. My wife and I were expecting something along the lines of Horatio HornBlower. Horatio it wasn't.Ok to watch once however it will gather some dust in our library before its next viewing.
5,"Amazing, sexy and smart","I read about this book in the Hot issue of OUT Magazine where Sycamore was the Hottest New Novelist, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. This is the most exciting book I've read in a while-- I really couldn't put it down! Sycamore's voice is raw, smart, and flamboyant. This tale of searching for meaning and sustenance in a world that wants to squash all difference and beauty is emotional in such a direct, unflinching, honest way. He really knows how to pare language down to it's essentials, while revealing so many unexpected twists, like grandmothers talking to their grandson about hustling, the startling beauty and danger in anonymous sex, and a sudden love for a girl in a diner singing ""Lean on Me"" or an old lady at the post office. The Provincetown section is absolutely hilarious-- Sycamore really knows how to present the gore of gay culture. What Edmund White says is right, ""I have seen the future and it is Pulling Taffy."""
1,A sad book from a tragically damaged author,"The jacket blurb from Edmond White says that Pulling Taffy is the future of gay fiction. I think the opposite is true. This book is basically an enormous sob from a tragically damaged author. And he has every right to be damaged -- his personal story is horrific(sexual abuse by both parents from a young age, etc.). But the semi-autobiographical main character of this book wanders through the world like a zombie, having no meaningful interactions and learning nothing. The book has plenty of sex, but none of it is remotely erotic. The book has plenty of bizarre events, but none of them is entertaining or insightful. The author needs therapy -- not a book deal. Hopefully, the next generation of gay writers will write from a stronger emotional place than this -- and produce more rewarding work."
2,Why the hype?,"I read this book after reading an article about how the author was a new innovative voice in literature. Literature? This book is more strick erotica than anything. While Bernstein has moments of illumination and his candid honesty is appreciated, he also teachers us nothing new, his writing style more ADD than anything. Why do so many books like this get published--it's just one of those hustlers plays around, does drugs, acts irresponsible and never gets it together. Another thing that should deter people is the price of this book. Almost eighteen dollars (retail) for a paperback? Not worth it, AT ALL."
1,HUGE waste of time,"You've read this book before...same story...different author. Lately it seems as though anyone with a sex or drug problem can take notes (and they don't have to be very concise or coherent) and have them published as a ""promising new author"". Here's an idea...find something to say FIRST. This book is incredibly insipid and mind-numbingly boring. May appeal to 13 or 14 year old wannabe-drag-queens."
3,"Nice Collection, Shame About The Company","Great stuff, but subject to poor mastering from knackered vinyl sources by a company with no ears and a refusal to obtain master tapes, even when offered them by the licensors! Standard cheap packaging and infantile grammar round off a real Scrooge's deal. As Soul Brother continue to work their way through some interesting catalogues and ruin/cheapen the music in the name of cost cutting...oh, why bother."
4,Good Overview,"it's always cool when a Career Retrospective comes out on a Artist that hasn't always gotten there due.that is the case here with Leroy Burgess He has done alot of Behind the scenes Material for a wide range of Artists.He Co-Wrote Rick James's ""Big Time"" back in the day among other Artists He has worked with.His Vocals&Production are on point here.a Cool Collection."
2,Wasn't all it was cracked up to be,"My husband and I thought this would be a great multi- use item. We do a lot of hiking (front pack) and jogging (stroller). But when we got this product home we were very disappointed. When using this item in the front pack it hooks around your neck, and hangs from your neck, we didn't see this noted in the information about it - that is a huge downfall is it gets pretty heavy after a while. Also, I didn't feel it encapsilated our child in the pack very well, and often times would flop forward if I leaned forward. We have a BOB stroller and I also didn't feel it worked very well in that setting, following the pictures on the package and placing it on the stroller, there are a fair amount of air gaps between my son and the fleece warmer. Needless to say it was kind of a let down for something we thought it was going to be a great product, we were able to find something else that works perfect for all of our uses[...]"
4,"Great book, but...","I am one of the many fans of R.D. Morgan's books. The amount of time spent on research is very impressive, and he brings to light criminals that are less known. His subjects are long overdue in being covered and he does a GREAT job with them, BUT PLEASE, include NOTES and INDEX!! As a fellow writer and researcher, you know how valuable those things are!! Keep up the GREAT work! We want more!"
4,Very helpful backstage story,"As I was writing a term paper about Broadway musicals a few years ago, I found The Making of West Side Story very helpful to my research. The book tells about the creation of the idea by Jerome Robbins and the subsequent collaboration with Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Laurents, and Stephen Sondheim. It tells of deep research into gang warfare, of grueling rehearsals with the oft-cold Robbins (in constrast to the gentler Bernstein), and of startled reactions to this unusual musical. It gives great insights into the motivations of the characters, the construction of the plot, and the choices of the lyrics and tunes.My only complaint is that this book gives no proper respect to the excellent movie version; it refuses to allow for the differences between the stage and the screen. (Note: I did see the 1979 Broadway revival, as well as high school productions, and have enjoyed the movie umpteen times.) Otherwise, The Making of West Side Story is highly recommended."
5,Excellent!,I received this switch very quickly. In fact sooner than I expected. It was a cinch to hook up to my monitors. I use it everyday because I am a teacher and it helps with all I do for teaching.
5,Classic Song Stylings From One of The All-Time Greats,"This CD is a wonderful compilation of some of Ms. Fitzgerald's interpretations of the Great American Songbook.You don't here the brassy, sassy scatting Fitzgerald, but you do hear someone who could take a song and totally make it her own. She never overpowers or oversings, but provides enough swing and sass to achieve the moods that the songwriters were looking for when they wrote the songs.This is a great collection and well worth owning."
4,Great book,Keeps you on your toes with each chapter. Loved it!This author knows how to grab your attention and keep it
1,This is soooooooooooo boring,Dougs so broing the charecters voices suck and why are so of the charecters skin green and blue. Hello? do we live in the simpons world? I really don't get what the crator is trying to tell us bad anmations cool? Doug knows nothing? Having blue skin is coo.........ZZZZZZZ opps sorry just thinking about this made me dose off. Still if you looking for a good old ncikloden cartoon watch rugrats or the first epsoides of sponge bob. This is a waste and not even worth 1 cent!
5,"one of the best workouts, yet easy","I found this video a creative, fun, yet short workout. One of the best so far, and I have alot of tapes. The tempo and explanation by Karen are easy to follow. It has helped all major areas of the body, although arms are not as intense as butt and thighs. The balls are pretty versatile, but I use dumbells too. I would recommend this to beginners or intermediate exercisers."
3,"An Anthropology book, not a Sociology book","This is an anthropological study of the politics of the people of Shasta Country, California. Its a typical college like textbook. It's too specific in its evaluation of social norms to these people to draw any general abstract conclusions, but thats the book. If you are interested in a specific case study, then the books kinda okay (its still written like a typical college anthropology textbook - deliberately dense and boring), but you're interested in general abstract conclusions about social norms that you would find in a sociology book, I recommend you pass on this expense book."
5,Completely awstruck by the spirit influenced music,We absolutley love all of the music and videos demostrated by Olanda Draper & Associates we just found this cd yesterday andhave played it alot already I only wish i could have seen him in person if anyone who knows anything about his background how he was raised and what faith he is i would be interested in any information. i love to watch his videos he totaly gets into his message and i love that in a gospel singer
4,Definitely works,Have used this and it definitely gets u going to the potty!! Bye bye water weight! I just don't like that it has to steep for a while...I am impatient.
4,Takes Some Getting Used To,"I took this as a liver detox and I believe it helped. The taste takes a little getting used to, and this is coming from someone who drinks green tea without any sugar."
1,NASTY,"I bought this because I read some reviews that said it was a good coffee alternative. For me, it is not. Unfortunately, the order came with multiple boxes. I kept one box JUST to remind me that I NEVER want to make the mistake of buying this again."
3,Ehh...,"I love Traditional Medicinal's Everyday Detox and Female Toner, but this stuff...hooo... I once had to a rent a cheap apartment whose previous resident was a two-pack-a-day smoker. The smell of this tea is identical to the smell of that apartment. When drinking it, it tastes very peanut buttery and I don't have a problem finishing a cup, but were it not for the tea's supposed health benefits (I admittedly haven't had enough to notice a difference) I wouldn't be drinking it."
5,Really does work for me.,"I have edema, low metabolism, osteoarthritis, low energy...think you get the idea. This tea works for me! I was buying it from my local Walmart but they stopped carrying it. Then I started to buy it from my local Safeway, but they also stopped carrying it. Local health stores want $2 more than what Walmart and Safeway were charging. I did a search on Amazon and I was happy. The taste is nutty. Took a bit to get used to, but I am very glad I stuck with it. It has really helped me. I did all kinds of research on this product to gain insight (pros and cons) and to me the pros outweigh the cons. It has helped me lose weight by increasing bile production. Eased my osteoarthritis pain. Helps relieve my edema that I have in my left leg. I am a believer in this tea.*If you do try this tea, make sure you follow the directions on the box*"
5,good price,I bought this tea because of the wonderful reviews on Amazon. I love reading up before purchasing. I tried it from my local health food store first to make sure I liked the taste. I really enjoyed it so I purchased from Amazon when I couldn't find it at the stores. Imagine my surprise that it was cheaper to purchase it off amazon. This is not always the case but happily for me this time it worked out. I got six boxes so I can clean my liver to my hearts content!
5,tea,I liked this tea because it is good to help your liver and I used this in my tea diet and contiue to use it
3,Good Product,I would recommend this product. I have been using this tea for two weeks. It has a roasted taste and overall good product
4,Surprising Taste for a Tea,"Tastes much more like coffee than tea. Adding an extra bag (one more than instructions), to hot water makes it even more so. Wife and I both like it."
2,Tastes like Dandelions,"I understand this has many, many health benefits. However, I really dislike the true dandelion taste it has. I would like to continue it for the health benefits, but I need to find something to add to cut that bitter dandelion taste. I drink a lot of different herbal and flavoured teas, but this is not something I could drink on a regular basis. I find it very unpleasant tasting. We all taste things differently, and this taste is not for me."
2,Disappointed,"It is my own fault, but I didn't look into this cookbook before buying it. I am vegan and have been using spelt flour for over three years. I was looking for a cookbook so I could be more versatile with foods. This book is certainly not vegan (although it doesn't claim to be). I also found many of the recipes to be on the unhealthy side. It was published in 1995 which may explain that. When cooking or baking, using large quantities of sugar and butter don't fit into my lifestyle so I will donate this cookbook with the hopes that someone will find it useful."
1,The Spelt Cookbook,"This book did not have recipes for the grain........just the flour. Oh, I just remembered......there was one, but it was just how to boil the grain. Very disappointing."
3,The Spelt Cookbook,"I find the book informative and helpful as I have just started using spelt flour instead of wheat flour. I do have a problem with some of the ingredients mentioned in recipes because I live in Australia and am not accustomed with certain brand names, so have to find out what the equivalent is here. Otherwise it is helpful to me and I am satisfied with your prompt service."
1,"review for Ah, Wilderness!",The book itself was very old and written in a lot. The binding was taped to hold the paper inside the cover. It was not a good quality book but I was still able to read it.
5,Contents...,"Speechless. That's often how people found themselves when they came face-to-face with the astonishing wisdom of Jesus of Nazareth. From the learned rabbis in the temple whose jaws dropped open at the words of a 12-year-old Jesus, to the wilderness defeat of Satan who unsuccessfully tempted the Savior even after He had grown pale with hunger from a 40-day fast, this compelling and swiftly-moving video takes you on a remarkable tour of Jesus' early years. Walk where Jesus walked and you, too, will find yourself speechless as you witness these remarkable episodes take from the life of Jesus, The Son of God.(1995, Nest Entertainment, Inc., color, 30 minutes, HI-FI stereo)"
3,quick delivery,looks good but I ordered the wrong thing so was unable to use but I will find a use later for it I'm sure
3,"Good setup information, but lacking in fish identifications","This book is good for the setup part of the Aquarium hobby, but is severely lacking in fish identifications. Meaning, it is one of the least used fish books I own. Most of the other information is good."
4,Outstanding...,I recently read this guide and found it very helpful in making decisions for my new acquarium and also discovered ways to care for my new friends! Life is much easier now.. Thanks Amazon!
4,Funny,"I found this and the previous book funny,but they are alittle weird. You might not like this book if you want abook that is believeable romance. It is good if you can laugh at some of the farout there magical things."
1,Hardly romantic,"I read the back cover and thought this seemed interesting. Well, I was wrong. Granted, I did not read the book(s?) that came before this one, but I feel like this author has no concept of the term ""romance.""There is very little relationship development between the lead characters. There are no intimate scenes other than a few kisses, so do not expect any lovemaking. I never really felt like I wanted these two characters to be together for the rest of their lives.I kept getting confused with all the rules of the different magical systems and why I should care. It also took forever for the action of the story to get going. I felt like I was stuck in a rut for 50+ pages for the hero to decide to accept his magic. The Fates were amusing, if sometimes annoying. I did like the son and his psychic abilities. That was probably the only bright (and humorous) spot. If you feel compelled to read this one, don't say I didn't warn you."
2,not enough romance,"For a romance novel, this sure lacked a lot of romance! I think the leads kissed 2, maybe 3 times throughout the book. They didn't really get to know each other very well - seems their ""love"" was based on the Fates prophesy and that's about it. It was kind of interesting to find out the Fates' fate in this book, but the plot just never seemed to really GO anywhere. It plodded along until it just came to an end. I was somewhat disappointed in Simply Irresistable (the book before this one) and I think I was even more disappointed in this one."
3,I admit it,"O.K. I admit it. Curiousity got the best of me. I had to see Viggo Mortensen's full frontal. It is what it is. However, this movie has other merits. It is a story about family and brotherly love. It is one brother's struggle to adjust to this world. I love it when Frank says he's still trying to figure out what happened to Santa Claus.I think that Sean Penn, the movie's writer/director, should have made a better link to how Vietnam added to Frank's rage and inability to fit in.I love the parts with the brothers bonding and playing rhyming games. Frank's brother really tries to help him.I got a little more than I bargained for with a birth scene. I also remember thinking gosh, these people smoke a lot! It is not a bad movie, and it does serve a purpose. However, I wouldn't want to own it."
5,a masterpiece!,"This movie is a rare and exceptional film. Besides being an excellent actor, Sean Penn has proven himself to be an exceptional director. He and Kiefer Sutherland both hold promise for unique films in the future.Penn's cast demonstrates his eclectic choice in talented actors. Of all of Morse's films seen by me this is his best role.The part for Viggo Mortensen was perfect. I always see any and everything done by Mortensen and Penn."
2,Not my fav David Morse film,"I was very disappointed with Indian Runner. I've heard DM mention it so many times in interviews that I had to have it. But honestly it was painful to sit through the entire thing. I found it very slow, Viggo's character is in no way likeable. Charles Bronson was a highlight but has little to do. David was good but his material was not. This was definitely one of the most boring movies I've ever endured."
5,The Indian Runner,"A smart, emotionally compelling movie that epitomizes the gap between love and understanding. The visual imagery of this film is subperb. Rich characters, realistic plots and an undertow of emotion drive this film to a climatic ending that registers with all."
2,Information good - quality of book poor,"This was a text book for a college class. The content of the book is a good introduction to the subject. As a design student, I feel I benefited from reading it. But, the book itself is cheaply produced. 100 pages, only a few black and white images of poor quality. (Actually, they look like poor photocopies.) The cost of the book is more expensive than many of my other text books, which were printed on quality paper and included lots of full color, photographic images.There have to be other books with similar content that are better value for the money."
2,música muy interesante... grabación muy mediocre,"El repertorio que se aborda en este disco merece la oportunidad de ser interpretado, grabado y, por supuesto, escuchado, en una versión más acabada. Es una pena que estas obras no llamen la atención de músicos especializados que puedan ofrecer una verdadera semblanza de la música. El ensamble de músicos deja mucho que desear... o quizá sea el sonido de la grabación, que también es pobre... la soprano Valentina Álvarez es una pena de oír: no musicalidad, problemas de afinación, de emisión... simplemente no está al nivel de integrarse en un proyecto que pretenda ser profesional. En resumen: música interesante muy mal ejecutada."
5,"Joan's down-and-dirty rock at its randy, dandy finest!","I first bought my ""Album"" LP at a K-Mart in the summer of '83...little did I know! I've played this record more than most any other in my collection... I'm talking HUNDREDS of times. Let's just say it's aged very well. Joan could have released this album in 1973 or 2003 and it wouldn't sound dated. You've probably remember ""Everyday People"" (the Sly Stone version recently co-opted on Toyota's latest ad campaign) and ""Fake Friends"" from Eighties rock radio. I've air-guitar-grooved forever to the gritty grrrl lust of ""The French Song"" and ""Handyman""...this record can wake you up in the morning, drive you home in the car - or rock the house at your next party. ""Album"" has a mean love jones - and a sense of humor. When I had a chance to finally meet Jett at an Albany-area show a few years ago, do you know which CD cover I had her sign? Three guesses."
5,"In the '80s, ""Album"" got me through high school","Joan Jett is a talented artist, and I think ""Album"" may well be her best work, it is certainly my favorite of her earlier albums. I'll take ""Fake Friends"" up against any of her songs. A true gem of a record. Rock on Joan!"
2,meh,"I only ordered this movie because a friend suggested it to me. It was really slow and I lost the movie before i could finish it. :( if you are really into RPG's and have dry humor this may be the film for you, it just wasn't my cup of tea."
5,This movie is an autobiography of anyone who owns 20-sided dice,"Do you know what this movie has that Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, ET, Gladiator and There Will Be Blood are all missing?LOTSFunny premise, ridiculously funny dialogue, funny songs, Madden (franchise mode), midgets, lovable characters (and yeah, I am still including ET), clowns, ridiculously disturbing references to beef jerky, corn farmers, pogs, role-playing, Beverly D'Angelo, John Heard, Kelly LeBrock and William Katt (although there is this deleted scene with him holding stone tablets) and a irreverent sense of humor.Seriously, if you like any or all of the above, you really need to check this movie out. It's definitely not for kids, and there might be one or two scenes that some might find offensive, but trust me, it's worth the viewing. If you want a big laugh, get this movie!"
1,Avoid at all cost....even free,"Are you an RPGer? Then this movie isn't for you.Are you a fan of comedy? Then this movie is definitely not for you.I rented this with low expectations to begin with, but since I was a roleplayer I figured there would be some decent ""inside jokes"" about gaming and it might be at least enjoyable.WRONG!The very little it does have on actual gaming is just juvenile and plain stupid. I've heard it compared to Napoleon Dynamite...not even close. I found absolutely nothing enjoyable in this and would sue the makers for the time back if I could. It really is that awful. I think I softly chuckled at maybe two or three little bits, but those are quickly forgotten under the deluge of lame attempts at humor everywhere else in the film.Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. Please...."
1,Painful,"It's supposed to be about a group of roleplayers setting a new record for hours spent on a single campaign, but it's actually a painful pseudo-documentary about crude, pathetic losers who don't even like each other. It panders to the worst stereotypes about gamers, because roleplaying is an easy target to pick on. There's really very little about actual gaming. The movie mostly focuses on bad attempts at low-level humor.If the phrase ""splattered with horse semen"" revolts you, run.Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.Worst.Movie.Ever."
1,I want my money back,"To say I hated this movie is too weak a description. It is offensive, gross, stupid, and unfunny. There are many good gamer movies out there and it gets confusing because they all have similar titles. Unfortunatley this is not one of them. If you have any respect for gaming, or any respect for yourself for that matter, don't waste your time with this one. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities about this story. One out of five stars is too generous a rating."
1,So sad ...,"There are some great pieces of gamer culture out there. This is not one of them. The budget seems to be pretty good, which is a shame, because the movie turns out to be so awful. It's not really even ABOUT the game, but rather about the real lives of the gamers ... who are all caricatures and stereotypes. Compared with ""The Gamers"", which you can find in about five parts on YouTube, this is pretty abysmal. It really is sad, because ""The Gamers"" obviously had a budget of about $20, and manages to poke fun at ""that guy"" in the gaming hobby while still treating the hobby as a whole with affection. When my buddy and I realized that the movie was halfway over and we had still only seen bits and pieces of the actual game (and had only given up some token ""pity-laughs""), we put in a different movie. I really wish I could say that I liked this film more than I did, because I love RPGs, and the guys who made this probably do too."
3,"It has it's moments, but is a little rough","I am a big fan of gaming and was looking forward to this film.When the jokes work, it is funny. But some of the pacing in the film is a bit slow. I would like to see a re-edit of the film to structure the film a bit differently."
2,"Buy ""Million Dollar Consulting"" Instead...","There is little to nothing new here that hasn't already been covered within Alan's incredible ""Million Dollar Consulting."" Based upon my very positive experience with ""Million Dollar Consulting,"" I made a significant investment to purchase most of the titles within the ""Ultimate Consulting"" series of books. Unfortunately, with rare exception, each of these books is little more than an expanded excerpt from ""Million Dollar Consulting."" My advice? Buy, borrow, beg or steal a copy of Alan's incredible ""Million Dollar Consulting."" If you already own it, save the money that you would have otherwise spent on this or other books within the ""Ultimate Consulting"" series to invest elsewhere in your practice. Good luck."
1,not what I ordered,"This is NOT Bumble & Bumble product. I have used the Thickening conditioner for 6 months now, usually purchased from a salon, but for convenience I purchased it online. It smells different, is a different color, much thicker than REAL Bumble conditioner, totally different. I suspect it's been repackaged."
1,Used to be great before they change formula in 2011,"I used to buy this product all the time before 2011, but then I got a bottle online that didn't smell or look the same texture, so I thought it was fake, but it wasn't. I went into Salons that are validated by Bumble and Bumble site in Houston and saw that it was the same type of product that I had just gotten at home, so they changed the formula! This new formula doesn't work one bit. The other product was truyly amazing, but this new formula they have does not do anything to my hair and it smells pretty bad too. I am so disappointed at this brand and product- that never again will I buy from them."
2,"Satisfied, but not impressed","The day that I posted negative feedback regarding my order it arrived in the mail and the seller finally got in touch with me. They issued a full refund, but I find it very unprofessional that they only contacted me once I had posted a negative comment, which they asked me to change/update if I was now satisfied."
3,unsatisfied,"Unfortunately, the product is watered down & the pump doesn't work. I've purchased this product from salons for five years. Believe me, I know what the consistency of the shampoo should be. Let the next consumer decide for themselves!"
1,complete waste of money,"These thickening products are terrible. I have used the shampoo and conditioner together on and off months now, so I'm leaving this review for both products.Sure, it thickens my hair--turning it into a completely unmanageable knot of ratty, tangly hair. There is NO way to comb through my hair after using these products (without ripping it all out) unless I use yet another twenty dollar Bumble and Bumble product (the Prep spray). And even then, as the day wears on my ends get all ratty and knotty.This does not happen with any other hair care product that I have ever used. I have very fine, medium length hair.What a waste of money."
2,Disappointing,I love the B&B thickening shampoo so I thought this would be good. Guess not for me. Made my hair harder to deal with.
4,Amazon Verified Purchase,I like it better than all of the other conditioners - best if used with the Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo. Delivery was not as speedy as I would have liked.
1,"No conditioning, just drying!","This product just dried out my hair, leaving me with fly-away frizzes that had to be managed with other products. It didn't seem to provide any noticeable thickening qualities. Don't waste your money! Bumble and Bumble Super Rich conditioner provided much better results, but I can get the same results with other, much less expensive products."
1,"Can't tell any improvment in my fine, limp hair","For the price I expected at least some amount of noticeable difference in my fine,limp hair after using this product. Instead, I could not see that it helped at all. Save your money!"
1,powerball,"look this gyro is o.k. but the powerball is better, and by powerball i mean the 250Hz powerball from rpm ltd."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie,"I enjoyed this movie for many reasons, my familiarity of the original story, the settings and character dynamics, etc. Sure the special effects were a little weird, but it's a Christian movie, not a big budget film.I was so engrossed that I was disappointed at the end and even wrote to Deseret to ask about whether the 2nd and 3rd Volumes were in the making yet.Also enjoyed the streaming. I hooked my laptop to my HDTV for the first time and it was great."
1,Bad audio,"The audio on this movie was so bad we couldn't watch it. I wanted to show it to my niece, who was studying the Book of Mormon, and we were SOOO disappointed with it."
1,Huh..?,"The filming of the movie is good, The acting is so-so and alot of overacting in places. The story is something to mulch over and makes you scratch your head and go Huh??? Not sure about the BOM story so lets see if Nephi and his family were Jewish and came over to South America, then their skin turned dark Lamenites). Thier linage is indian? This is a interesting tale...huh? I would rate it 1 star...."
2,epic but corny,"Dude so some parts were corny and other parts were awkward. I felt that the film got better and better as it went on. The movie only got better from the begining. Cool story, i wish there was a higher budget film of this though..."
3,Not that great.,"The directors first feature length film, it shows. The acting is corny, the costumes are fit for a stage play and the script is a pretty simple narrative. Children might like it, but you really need to wait for a better film to come out. There are a few in pre-production. Hopefully one of them actually get's made."
2,Mustang Gloves,"The gloves are really thin, and the symbol is already peeling off.Wouldn't have bought them if I knew."
3,Full Metal Alchemist Gloves,"I bought these for my grandson several months ago.He wore them a lot at first and wore them out.They were not as durable as a 14 year old grandson, but he got some enjoyment out of them."
2,I'm not impressed,"I had some other expectations to these two books. Shotokan Karate Kata Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are nice to have, BUT don't thing of these books as source for learning Kata.regardsSiavash T."
3,Kinda bogus but entertaining,"My son (17) considers himself a draconologist. He loved this movie and thought it was true but it's pretty fictional. Still, it was entertaining."
4,Fun to watch and believe!!!,"It is very interesting and very fun to watch! Anyone who likes dragons would love this movie! The scenes are so realistic. I did not see it on TV but just got in on DVD. I thought it would have been more like ""The Future is Wild,"" but it was more like a movie. That's way I'm just giving it 4 stars. It did make me think that maybe dragons could be real."
4,Parental Guidance,"Parents of small children should be aware that there are some icky moments. The scientists are dissecting the ancient dragon carcass, basically pulling out sloppy, gloppy organs and musing over them. ""Hmmm. What did THIS do?""Also, at one point a baby dragon has to consume the flesh of its deceased parent in order to survive. Not a great precedent to set!"
4,Dragon's World: A Fantasy Made Real,"This movie was made as tho it was a real 'Nature' show. The graphics were very good. The scientists went step by step in identifing the animal and used scientific methods to do so. Well, they stretched science a little to go in the direction they needed it to prove the animal was a dragon. But it was quite convincing that dragons may have really existed. The grandchildren really liked it."
2,Tis ok.,"Im a big fan of dragons, I liked the movie somewhat but I wished it dove into history more than it had. It only touched on things I already knew of draconic origins and the rest was fiction. Great animations. I originally saw it on Discovery Channel and had wanted a copy for myself for a long time before I looked at amazon for it."
1,Aired on British Television,"This ficumentory has just been aired on UK television.The blend of documentary and background detailed fiction, along with amazing effects and just the right level of intrigue and mystery, make this as good, if not better than the Walking With Dinosaurs series.This production ads credibility to the fantasy, making myth as good as real.Well worth buying. Now I've seen it, I'm more likely to buy than just by reading the reviews. Fantastic experience."
5,Awsome pseudo-science...,"This was recommended to me after I did an analysis of dragons for a literature class. I love how they did a scientific study of a dragon. A little bit of it was far-fetched, but most of it was explained in a manner that one could really believe this was true. It really made the brain whirl to imagine dragons were once real."
5,Great Spelling book,I like all the activites that go with each lesson. Wouldn't use any other spelling program.
3,Just not for my hair,"I have really thick dry hair. It seems to hold well when I first apply it but then 3 hours later my hair will go flat. It also feels incredibly greasy and clumps my hair together. It doesn't smell very good either. BB Sumotech however is one of the best styling products I have used. It smells much better, doesn't feel oily, applies easier, and holds much better for me."
1,overpriced and hard to use!,"I was very disappointed in this product for several reasons. first, very little product for the price so I expected it to be amazing...which it was not...secondly you have to ""melt"" the wax by heating it to use it effectively which is a real annoyance. Finally, the end result once you have done this is a slick pile of wax in your hair that ends up flattening it not giving it lift or volume which I had hoped for....so disappointed because the product description sounded so good."
4,works well in cooler weather,"melt this wax with your blowdryer and it will harden after you've sculpted your hair thus forming a strong hold. sometimes I literally put my head in the freezer to make sure my hair is how i want it when I leave the house. :) the problem with this is that if you live in a hot climate area or work in the sun, the hold weakens because the wax melts again. I'm not saying your forehead will be oily. you'll just notice that the hold lost a little life."
3,Works well but can't stand the smell,"I really liked how my hair could be styled in different ways (I have short hair) and stayed the way I wanted for most of the day.The only problem I had with it is the smell. Some of the other reviews say the smell is not overpowering and it isn't unless the Sun hits your head. When the Sun hits your head on a warm day, forget it. It starts to have a very waxy smell (duh) plus add in some of that fragrant they put in it and the mix does not smell pleasant."
4,"A teeny, tiny amount will do ya!","This is a good product for someone needing a lot of hold for shorter hair. Only a little is needed to set it in just the right place. However, once your hair is there, it is staying.Not a hard hold, but a tacky, sticky one. Only a smidge will be needed, allowing this small jar to last forever."
1,Does not work on my hair,"Sorry, but this product does not work on my coarse, straight hair. Yes, the product starts off stiff--so stiff that you almost can barely apply and run it through your hair. It is so freakishly shiny I have Darth Vader helmet head. Not strong enough to slick my hair back, and falls apart in no time flat, and I can't even restyle it. My hair isn't even that long--the longest parts fall right at my earlobes. I tried using a small amount, I've tried using generous amounts, doesn't work for me. A waste of money. I'm currently happy using Sexy Hair Play Dirty wax--controls hair, but not stiff."
3,A bit too waxy for me,"I'm a huge Bumble & Bumble fan, but this one is literally like a jar of wax. It definitely has major control for your hair, but I pretty much need to wash my hair before going to bed unless I want it all over my pillow and getting on my face while I sleep.If you're looking for something that waxy it's probably great but I think the less waxy version in the black jar is better and less extreme."
5,Great,"The wax does exactly what it says it will. It holds style. It definitely makes the hair feel a bit greasy, but not overly so, and it doesn't show up shiny, so you don't look greasy. I think that a bit of greasiness comes with the territory of wax! I have curly hair, so I just use it on the top near my scalp, but if you had a straight, short cut, I think this product would work beautifully to hold the hair in a style, as it holds my style even when weighed down with the heaviness of long hair. Would recommend this product."
3,aok,"charlie rose,is his best in all his interviews, i do like the willie morris interview, albeit, it is too short, of such a gifted author. also, the price of the video, is a little too far off the mark, it should be reduced and put on dvd instead. the price does not justify the marketing of this product on video. 25 dollars is too much. for this outdated format."
2,Music for the Voice... Revised,"Really disappointed and tricked by the word ""Revised""... I have the original which must be from the 70's and the contents are exactly the same... the 2 stars are for the original..."
5,GOOD COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF CAPTIVE FROGS,I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT BOOK WITH LOTS OF GOOD IDEAS AND HELPFUL PICS.
4,Enthralled,"I'm not in the habit of writing these things...however I am so enthralled by this music I felt I had to share my thoughts. The CD is a good introduction to the immense variety of music coming out of Africa. My favorites are Ndima Npapedza (#1) by Oliver Mtukudzi and Wassiye (#7) by Habib Koite'. The music is fun and yet has depth to it. I listen to it and while I'm tapping my toes, my soul is singing right along. I recommend this one highly."
3,Africa,"This album is a good one if you put it with others like it and put your collection on ""shuffle"" while you are working around the house. It's fun to dance to, and there is a good mix of different kinds of African music here. Les 4 Etoiles ""Doly"" sounds like Tabu Ley, and Oliver Mtukudzi's ""Adumi Ndapedza"" is pretty much a good representation of his overall sound, even though it's not my favorite song by him. Diaou Kouyate's ""Gafale"" grows on you, and I find myself humming the tune sometimes because it's catchy. Johnny Klegg has a song on here, as well."
3,VHS Abdominals & Back,"I have a friend who would like to order your VHS Abdominals & Back video. However, she does not have access to the internet and has ask if you have a toll free telephone number she can call to place an order?"
3,A fine account of China during the last part of WW2,"Harrison Forman lived among communist Chinese troops on the ground in northern China as the Chinese fought against Japanese invaders during the last year or so of World War 2.Forman's account is personal, up close, and a compelling picture of life lived among the communist soldiers. He's especially good at documenting relations between the civilian population and the soldiers.Forman's account is, of course, limited: he writes before the communists came to power in 1949. But this is a story of a time little known in the west, and his account is good at bringing to mind what occurred then."
2,Not the item in the picture when ordered.,"If I'm not mistaken the item in the picture is solid black. The glasses I received have a clear tint at the bottom which I was not happy with. Will be returning this item. They did fit nicely, but as I mentioned I wanted solid black all around not just on 3/4 of the shades."
2,Big Disappointment,"Although a few small details helped, for those who know anything about horses, and hooves it did not help much for mini owners looking to trim their own. Way too expensive for the content."
3,Works well - First one defective,"Works well, however, the first one I received did not work properly (4 outlets didn't work). Amazon replaced, at no cost, with a replacement which seems to work fine.I may not have the proper ear, but I wouldn't swear that it makes my HDTV sound better, but I simply bought it for voltage protection."
5,Excellent Power Strip on Steroids,"Had a few power outages and so far no damage to my devices. Comes with phone line and coax video cable.Great labeling as I have hooked this up to LCD TV, AV Receiver, HD DVD Player, Blu Ray Player, Wireless router, 5 Disc Changer, Cable Box, Nintendo Wii.Great spacing for all sorts of bulky plugs.Excellent digital meter will let you know how much current and voltage you are using."
3,This thing is HUGE,Be sure to check the dimensions of this item before you purchase. Make sure you have enough room for it.
4,Seems OK,"Except for being very large I have no problems with it. I use it to power A Toshiba 73"" tv, xbox, dvd, etc. I assume it's doing it's job and protecting my equipment. No problems. By the way getting it on Amazon saved alot of money over the prices charged at Circuit City."
2,A RIDICULOUS MONSTROSITY!,"There is no need for this thing to be so huge!! The technology exists for it to be the size of a regular surge protector, but monster decided to make it obnoxiously massive, roughly the size of a volkswagen. It probably doesn't do anything special, and it is overpriced, made-in-china garbage. The pic. doesn't do its obesity justice. I don't know where the he11 I'm going to put this thing, I might need a garage for it."
4,"Great Product, eliminated the humming","Great Product, eliminated the humming at low volume in my surround system. However, due to the large size of the unit and the angle of the plug outlets, I cracked one of the plugs when I pushed the entertainment center back to the wall. It still works like new. Over all I would still buy it again. I was able to buy this HTS 2000 MKII from amazon for less than the HTS 1000 from Nebraska Furniture Mart, which was the cheapest place in town."
2,Power center failed,"It looks like the power on button disconnected or separated from it's socket and it will no longer turn on. I thought at first it needed a reset but that wasn't the case. I don't think there was a major power surge because my other surge protector on my computer wasn't affected.Admittedly I used the power on button daily to reduce power vampirism from the equipment when off but still, for this much money you'd think it wouldn't fail like this.2 stars for working well for over a year before abject failure."
1,Serioulsy reconsider buying Monster products,"I truly wish I could provide a decent review as I had done a bunch of research before buying and was looking forward to using it, but I never really had a chance to use it. Straight out of the packaging several of the outlets simply didn't work. I had to return it (at my expense). While I noticed several other reviewers had commented on intial purchases not working, I thought it was a fluke. Now I realize Monster must have a massive quality control problem. My neighbor returned a similar Monster product (bought at a big box store after I purchased mine) and he had the same problem. For what you are paying you shouldn't have to gamble at all on whether the unit will work or not.BTW, please review the product's warranty. It won't be valid if you purchase from a non-authorized seller. While Amazon is an authorized seller, most of their market place sellers are not."
1,Not sure about Monster,"This is another product I was talked in to purchase. Bad design, too bulky and difficult to situate. I'm not sure how much better this surge works than others that cost 1/3 of it's price.Research more about what you need before buying the Monster products."
3,"Good for the beginner, less useful for the experienced","I have this book but don't find that it is really an encyclopedia (where you'd go to look up a technique, for example.) The salt, sponge, lifting techniques are nicely documented, so this book would be good for a beginner who doesn't have these tricks up his or her sleeve yet. The section on skies is useful as well.In summary, if you are a beginning landscape watercolorist, you might really like this book. If you are a past master, pass this one by."
2,Okay but not all that helpful,"I was disappointed in this book. There seemed to be a lot of emphasis on various ""tricks"" like masking fluid and salt crystals. There didn't seem to be many new or fresh ideas to inspire me."
4,"Easy to understand, easy to use, a little tricky 2 implement","First off, if you are a beginner at programming, this book is great. The book gives you easy to understand, hard to fail examples that walk you through the code and gives you a basic understanding of what your writing.The only time I struggled was when I was trying to implement the code to my own applications. This is the book's only short coming in that it doesn't explain the possible errors that you might encounter. Eventually, I was able to figure out the reasons for my problems, but it took a little time. But I have a few different books, including the VBA handbook and my feeling is that this book does the best job of getting you moving along. If you plan on writing a lot more code, eventually you'll probably want to pick up one of the large reference books, but for learning the ropes, start with this book."
1,Renamed old book,"This is ""Microsoft Access 2000 Visual Basic for Applications Fundamentals"" with a new title, same text,diagrams and files. This was not rewrittened or updated, just renamed."
3,I would have liked more...,This is a good book but I found it to be a little too basic for me. A good book for beginners though...
3,"No longer made in France, ours was made in China","Considering all the concerns about the safety of toys made in China, I was happy to pay more for a doll made in France. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case as Corolle no longer makes the dolls in France, but in various countries in Asia and Europe. The one we ordered was made in China. The doll was cute as pictured and my daughter loves an older mini-Corolle that was passed down to her. This one is going back to Amazon though and I will continue to search for a doll that is not made in China."
5,Baby Doll,"This baby doll is perfect for my twin grandsons who have a baby sister and love to cuddle their own ""baby"". The doll was a big hit on Christmas when we gave them to the boys. They carried them around, put them in a cart to take them for a ride and seemed to enjoy playing with them. They are just beginning ""imaginative play"". These dolls are good additions to their toy collection."
1,punk is still very dead,"Turbonegro is the music equivalent of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"". What this means is that this band tries to be hip and cool by being gay. Homosexuality is not a trend, and straight men should not listen to this music. And what of the music, the same punk rock thats been hashed out from coast to coast for 20 years and still is crap. Just because it's Norweigan doesn't make it better. This isn't irony, this is stupidity. ""Oh dude! a haha, turbonegro pretend to be gay"", so I don't care, Elton John actually is gay, and his music is ten times better (Elton John, as we all know, isn't that great either). Man, punk is so dead."
5,Best rock and roll album of the nineties.,This was the best rock and roll album of the nineties. It is an excellent album from a very influential band. Anyone who doesn't like Turbonegro is poser and should be executed immediately.
4,To the point!,"I liked this book, because it was short, and very to the point. The book is witty and clever. Maynard answers some popular questions. This book is definately a must read for any episcopalian.It's a relatively easy read as well, i read it in one sitting. Its a shame, Amazon doesn't stock it anymore.The only reason i gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that i noticed quite a few grammatical and formating errors in the book (or at least in my opinion, i thought they were errors). I think Maynard needs to find a better editor. Other than that, great book!"
4,Good Recipe Book,I enjoyed reading this cookbook. It has several original recipes and many helpful tips. Outside cooking us fun and easy.
3,Turkey?,Book is an effective resource but to pretend that it should be titled as a turkey frying book with only a handful being turkey recipes is a little misleading to me. Fine book recipe wise other than the bait and switch set up.
4,Good Soft Pillow Cases,"These are very good pillow cases -- flannel type feel, not Egyptian Cotton, but I like flannel. Since I got these for free with the sheets I'd have few complaints in any case but I was very pleased."
2,The product is fine...,...but it wasn't the same as pictured online. I haven't returned it because to do so would be too much hassle and expense for something so cheap.
4,Definately a Great Illustrated Classic,"I love the Great Illustrated Classics and I love Jane Eyre. I've been waiting for this book to come out for years. The pictures in here are very well drawn. Jane is as I pictured her to be. She's plain and proper. She might look a little to old to be 18, though. Rochester looks like a dark, brooding Master. He might be a bit too handsome, however. Mrs. Reed looks like a creepy old witch. Adele has really short hair which I think should be long and curly. The cover art does not match the pictures inside. Jane does not have curly hair. One of the pictures is in the wrong place, and a few are inaccurate. For example, when Rochester is at Ferndean, he should have a hand missing, but they show him with both hands. Overall, the pictures are very well done. The rewritten story is close enough to the book. It's a little abrupt at times, but still a good read for a child."
3,Felling of the Sons,"The Felling of the Sons: A Bonanza NovelI haven't had a chance to read the entire novel, but I've read a few pages and it looks interesting and reads well. Nicely written."
4,Great For Bronson Fans!,"Once again Charles Bronson plays the role of the hero.The leadlady in the movie is played by Jill Ireland.She hires Bronson tobreak her husband out of a Mexican prison.According to the movierhetoric,when you go to prison in Mexico you never come out again.You have to make note that Randy Quaid plays the role ofhis mechanic.You also have an appearance by Robert Duvall in themovie.He was riding high after his role in the Godfather.Afterbeing hired by the wifw played by Jill Ireland Bronson decidesto use a helicopter to break the husband out of the Mexicanprison.The escape sequence is very exciting as well as actionpacker.During this time period Bronson was making a lot of movies.This was one of them."
2,Jill Ireland ruins the film.,"Mrs CB cannot act and because she has a big part the film is ruined by her, imho."
4,LIFE IMITATING ART,"When BREAKOUT was released in 1975, it was shown at Jackson State Prison (Michigan). Several days later, someone tried to break an inmate out of the prison using a helicopter. Unlike the film it failed. But another classic example of life imitating art. The prisoners would have been better off trying to get an imitation of Sheree North in (the)black lingerie (sequence). BREAKOUT is yet again another enjoyable Bronson time waster, not of the caliber of his work with Michael Winner, but still worth a look. The Jerry Goldsmith score is first rate as expected."
1,lots of outdated descriptions,"This,and many other books on the caribbean suffer from irregular updates.It's OK if the hotel or restaurant is long established,and will therefore be included,although this isn't always a guarantee,as recently closed establishments tend to still be listed long after their demise.Many guides(including this one) just send a questionnaire to establishments asking them to up date information,and to include a brief description,thus many listings are far from impartial.The most consistently accurate guide for this area,updated yearly by the author himself is Doyles Guide to the Windwards and Leewards.This is mainly aimed at sailors but gives accurate (and updated)descriptions of shore based establishments."
4,Beautifully Designed,"This is a beautiful figure through and through, and much detail is put into it. Personally I find that this sculpture represents Henrietta's shy yet mysterious personality perfectly, and it is EXTREMELY well crafted, as expected of Good Smile Company's merchandise. I have never bought a PVC figure before, but this lives up to my expectations of what a figure should look like: simple, elegant, and definitely worth the purchase."
4,Restoration Musical Theatre,"'The Indian Queen' with music by Henry Purcell strikes me like so much of Purcell's other music. It always reminds me of the 'Masterpiece Theatre' theme with great pomp and circumstance, but weak on musical value. That is, until the arias! They are still no match for the great German or Italian arias, and they are just a bit tinny, like so much English music (except the works of the German Handel), but this is still good stuff.The plot is almost entirely inconsequential, as it is pure fantasy. The work's greatest value to the casual listener is that it is a great exemplar of English Restoration musical theatre, which seemed to have a lot more in common with American musical theatre than the operas by continental composers.A facinating piece from a neglected corner of musical history."
1,Not an authorized paperback,"This book is NOT a paperback of the hardcover version. It's a ""bound galley,"" meaning that it's a pre-publication version before the author had the opportunity to revise it. I (the author) subsequently revised and improved it significantly and can reliably inform you that the ""paperback version"" being advertised does not accurately reflect the hardcover version that was ultimately published. Do not buy it in the belief that you will receive an inexpensive of the hardcover."
3,These were a gift....,I bought these for my Mom and she loved this Ying/Yang stuff....but I thought these earrings would be a lot bigger. They were really tiny. She liked them but I was hoping they were bigger.
4,Ear rings,These earrings are pretty good. Pretty much what I expected. This is the second time I have purchased them.
2,Picture Quality is awful,"The books begins with an introduction, then many images from the Tres Riches Heures, and at the end there is a commentary of the pictures.The big problem is that the pictures were made in the sixties, they are fuzzy, unsharp, the colors are not vivid and bright, such a very low quality of photocomposition is no more acceptable at the end of the 20th century. It is high time that a newer edition be made available in English, as is already the case in French."
2,Disappointment,I am an ultimate Net Force fan. I loved the first seven books; it was my favorite series at the time. Book 8 let me down a little bit but this one was just awful. None of the characters are anywhere nearly as interesting as the initial characters. Thorn is much less interesting than Michaels. Fiorella adds a subplot while Lowe adds nothing. Fernandez is now a guest star. Kent is an extremely subpar substitution for John Howard. The new Gridley is a joke compared to the old hotshot. The antagonists have no depth. Michaels needs to get back in the picture and save the series from sticking itself farther down the tubes.
2,Spring-bored,"Are they kidding? This series has turned into Net Farce. In no particular order we get a Chinese computer geek who breaks into mega secure US government systems as well as some heavy duty commercial systems with consumate ease, a lecture on religion, or lack thereof, our hero, Jay Gridley, getting a new pair of VR glasses which may or may not let him catch the Chinese computer geek, several lectures on parenthood and is it more important than the job, Abe Kent stalking and killing the bad guy from the last book (or was it two books ago) after the bad guy first steals Abe's socks without taking his shoes off, a Chinese general who hatched the whole plot (plot? plot? don't ask!) and bites the big one (really!) while in Net Force custody, and oh what a lovely romp. Gawd, this series is going to the dogs. I think it's picked up a virus and needs to get its hard drive wiped and reformated."
1,Confusion Reigns,"I am a Tom Clancy addict, I've read them all. This is absoultly the worst book ever put out under his name. Actually it may be the worst book of its type I have ever tried to read. I put it down after about 100 pages. There is no plot, the characters are one dimentional, and the story drags, with many pages that have nothing to do with the story. Grindly keeps going off into virtual reality and these little excursions make absolutly no sense. I will sell my copy, used for ten cents, and will be drasticly overcompensated."
2,Not really Clancy,"I was dissapointed when I picked up this book. I thought--wow! A new Clancy---but it's written by someone else, and Clancy's name is slapped on the POS. It's just not the same as a real Clancy."
2,A point to make,"I have agree that this is the worst book of the series so far, but if you'll examine the credits a bit more, you'll see that Clancy isn't responsible for this farce. He had the basic concept and then handed it over to Perry. And I ahve to say quite honestly that Perry generally isn't that great an author, he seems to generate most of his sales by hanging onto the coattails of better authors and series i.e. Clancy, Star Wars, etc... But don't blame Clancy for this one, unless you think he should have proofread it first."
1,Horrid book,"The Net Force haven't always been up to par with Clancy' other books and with the other ongoing serirs, Op-center. The book starts out and then disintegrates into a plodding story. Instead of focusing on the events, the author time Jay's new quwest to be a fatherhood .Alot of other things afre wrong including the reason why the General has inflilitrated the computers. Read it if your really are desperate for a Clancy fix. This book is the worse of the entire series(I have read all of them)"
1,Shocking,"This is the first Net Force book I've read, bought for me on a whim. I've read all Clancy's own works and this is something else entirely. I can honestly say, one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.The story although somewhat basic was more or less a passable effort for about three quarters, excusing the cliches, stereotypes, meandering story lines, building up we think to some climactic event? Wrong. What happened towards the end left me truly stunned and feeling quite cheated.It felt almost as if it was thrown together over a coffee in a single sitting, no thought, no plan.We're left to believe that the whole book was somehow a plan of misdirection for the events in the final couple of chapters, though why or even how these would be linked, god knows. Just complete random rubbish"
2,This one is a flop,"This is easily the worst entry into the series. The plot took the team into an arena that is not their forte. Probably 7/8 of the book is a buildup to a conflict that lasts maybe a dozen pages. It reads like something that was thrown together at the last minute to meet a publisher's deadline. There was so little plot impetus, a secondary plot from an earlier entry was needed to pad the number of pages. The bad thing is that it was more interesting than the primary plot line and over, also in an unsatisfactory manner, half way through the book. Not much right with this one."
3,Not that bad. . .,"This was my first Net Force book (I got it from a co-worker) and I wasn't as disappointed as the other reviewers were, probably because I hadn't read the 8 prior books (or maybe because I didn't pay for it?). It was interesting enough for me to read it to the end. I'm new to the whole vr simulation / internet security / military intrigue genre so I was completely entertained. I was impressed enough to track down the other 8 books to read them, so I will say that this book seemed a little too contrived in hindsight. My favorite was #5 Point of Impact. Hammer, anyone?"
1,Don't waste your money,"I have found previous Net Force novels fairly entertaining, but this one is terrible. It tries to make up for poor plot and lack of good VR sequences by including sexual escapades of various characters in almost every other chapter, descriptions of nudity in some of the VR's, and even the art hanging in some of the homes described. I can't believe Clancy has stooped this low. I won't buy another of his novels."
5,English Ladymass,This is an incredible CD. I have another one of their CD's and had to get another one. The women who sing this are heavenly.
5,Other worldly bliss,"The American Angels fly again from their permanent perch in heaven, inviting us all to accept this bliss. And they did thisrecording many years ago. Timeless perfection and beauty.Kim Thomas Hartman"
3,"Great, but you can get MORE","I purchased this cookbook along with ""Food network kitchens Favorite Recipes"",This is a great cookbook, but when you purchase the other you get everything this one has & more!!"
2,What a disappointment,"I thought this was a collaboration of all the chefs on thefood channel. This book is written by the staff of the food channel kitches, not ie, Rachel Ray, Naked chef, etc.I was disappointed, the receipes were just so-so."
3,Hmmm...,"Having heard a promising sample of Mtukudzi's music, and having read the laudatory introduction by Bonnie Rait, I had high hopes for this album. But sadly, I was disappointed. Oliver's voice is nice, but the songs don't really seem to go anywhere. I listened to it, always thinking to myself, ""This next song will blow me away,"" but it just never came. I'm sorry to say that this album is repetitive and rather boring."
5,Breathtaking!,"This album was so powerful that I went out and purchased everything I could of ""Tuku Music"" and just loved it. The translated words of all of Mtukudzi's songs are so powerful and so beautiful. It is ""message music"" with a bluesy theme. Mtukudzi's gruff voice is in the tradition of great blues singers from John Lee Hooker to Leadbelly. There are few records that you can listen to from beginning to end without getting tired. Here's one that you'll do that with, time and time again."
5,One of Godard's best,"This is a beautiful, exilarating, joyful film if there ever was one. I can't watch this thing without getting an overwealming sense of euphoria. Godard wasn't really known for making such whimsical films, and this one still contains his cynical observations on the relationships of people, but it is nevertheless is most exuberant picture. I consider this my favourite film of his, and indeed one of my favourite films ever, along with his (far more depressing) ""Contempt"". All the acting is wonderful to watch, Anna Karina is incredible, as is Belmondo. It also features some of Godard's most exciting experimentation. See this film."
5,To be re-released by Criterion,A Woman is a Woman should be re-released by the Criterion Collection in the 2nd half of 2004. Save your money from buying the expensive Fox-Lorber version.
2,Don't Bother,"For anyone who loves silent movies, this version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" is not worth your time. For anyone who hates silent movies, this film is excellent support for your position. This movie was made after Frank Baum had died, which is the only reason I can think such incredible license was taken with the original book. A disappointment."
3,wizard of oz- american home entertainment version,"a very interesting story line,the only thing is the bizarre music score.it's a too modern psycadelic jungle music totally inapropiate for this movie alternating with a little original type music. they also had poor narration to go with it. movie content was different but good."
1,...for the record...,"...silent films were never silent, there was always live music, be it a lone piano, a small ensemble, a theater organ, or a full orchestra at the biggest theaters, so the question of accompaniment is not merely academic. That said, no score could possibly help this tedious mess of a film. I saw it once for free at a local library and was able to laugh at, not with, the film, but now I can only find it painful. Only for silent film completists - if it did go out of print it would be no real loss, and that's from a diehard silent film enthusiast."
3,About the connection of this film to the original book,"Well, for one thing. The story sticks pretty close in Dorothy's background. She has an Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. She lives on a farm. Some connection right there. It falls down quite a bit connection-wise in establishing Dorothy was discovered as a baby by her aunt and uncle. A poster here says the actress in this film playing Dorothy is Semon's wife. Actually I think the lady was instead Oz author L. Frank Baum's daughter-in-law. I wonder if the monarch bit of this story was inspired by the collapse of European monarchies seven years earlier."
4,Good movie to watch while tripping,I saw this movie years ago on a television inside a fish tank. I thought it was pretty cool.
2,Have to agree,"Other than catching an early Ollie Hardy and the few bits of the tale that do adhere to the Wizard of Oz, much of this is a showcase for Semon, who not only must have had an ego the size of Saturn, but who's a virtually unknown silent comediam today for an excellent reason -- he wasn't funny. He's the poor man's poor man's poor man's (yes I know I repeated it 3X; intentional) Chaplin"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE!,"I HAD THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. FIRST OF ALL IT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR, THERE IS NO YELLOW BRICK ROAD AND NO INDICATION OF THE HOUSE ON THE SLIPPERS, ETC. SHE LANDS ON THE SCARECROW AND THEY PROCEED TO FIND THE TINMAN ON A BRIDGE ALL OILED UP (!) THEN THERE IS NO LION, ALL THREE (!) OF THEM WATCH A BIAZZRE PARADE AND WIND UP IN IT. THEN AFTER ALL THAT GARB, THEY SEE THE WIZARD IN HIS USUAL FORM, NOT IN ANY SPECTACTULAR DESGUISE!! HE PERFORMS SOME STUPID TRICKS AND AFTERWORDS, DOROTHY DOESN'T EVEN GO HOME.IN THE END THERE IS NO PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED! THIS IS THE BIGGEST WASTE, BUT IF YOU WANT IT, GO TO A DOLLAR STORE!"
2,the worst,the only intersting part was the sword fight with kynd and kruel.It was very sad. dorthy is so shallow.
1,I'm sofa king we todd did!,I thought the movie was very excellant but the very first line by Frank Baum's was very difficult to understand!I give the movie 1 star=:(
3,Kind of funny,"This could have been a lot more fun if the verbage had been more clever. The ""joke"" is given away too soon."
5,Unforgettable collection,"I was extremely impressed by these stories when I read them in April of 1951. The book was the best book read that year. I have selected a ""best book read this year"" each of the years of my reading life, and this book is the only collection of short stories which has ever won that accolade!"
1,Not sure what I am supposed to be feeling,"I took this vitamin for a month, not sure what it is supposed to do for me, but didn't feel much different."
5,Ground Zero is ASSMASTER,"Folks, This album is simply a compilation of the Raging Slabs' first LP and follow-up EP ""True Death""(for Buy-Our-Records outta NJ). This album also contains two extra cuts: the cover of Cheech & Chongs ""Earache my Eye"" & an original ""In Contempt"". The RCA S/T release is actually their 3rd record, not their first. It is also worth mentioning that Greg Completely REMIXED the material on Slabbage that comes from their debut record ""Assmaster"". If you ever have the chance to hear the Original ASSMASTER on vinyl (never released on CD) it sounds completely different and to my ears better in many ways. You can hear entirely different gtr parts etc. Since you probably never will see that record, start here. True Death is THE best recording the band ever made and it is all right here on Slabbage!"
5,the violent men,"A great movie with all star cast. Just don't make 'em this way anymore. I like most any Glen Ford movie and with Edward G, Barbara Stanwyck, how can you go wrong. Ever notice how Ford rides a horse? I've always admired that."
4,Glenn Ford is as good as ever,This movie has a great cast and a great plot. I bought it because it had Glenn Ford in it and it was cheap. The picture quality is good. I think this movie is better than the description would lead you to believe.
4,"Good product, but pants are too long.","This rainsuit works very well, especially the jacket. The water proofing is excellent and the price is decent. The only problem is that the pants are too long and it is hard to alter them since it would ruin the waterproofing."
4,Rain Gear is Good,"I like it, although it's a little hot here in MI in the summer, but it does keep the rain out well. It seems to be holding up well, and it is quite thin. I have already used it a fair amount."
4,High & Dry,I wanted a rain suit for fishing that was inexpensive. I got both and alittle more. The suit is really well made and is plyable. Good buy forthe money.
4,Columbia Rain Gear,The rain suit was purchased for my son who works outdoors. Finding rain gear that will hold up for those who work outdoors was not easy. The rain suit is well made and was reasonably priced.
4,Just Right,"Purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my Dad. He likes to walk alot, even at 92, and was looking for a new Columbia Rain Jacket. This fits the bill, he wears it over his winter jacket, and in the spring without, keeps him dry. He had a Columbia previously but it got so worn, doesn't necessarily want the pants but they came with it. Who knows maybe he will wear them to on a reslly bad day."
4,Reasonable Price,-Price is fair w/ a Brand you know you can trust.-Timely delivered.-Cannot be compared to those cheap 5 dollar Ponchos that rip apart the minute you move....-Two pair for the price of one.... I dont have to buy and match the upper and lower portion of the suit.-Best of all Im happy using it.
5,Simply...A Great Single!,"The third single from Sixpence None the Richer's platinum-selling self-titled album shows a resemblance to their previous top 40 hits ""Kiss Me"" and ""There She Goes"". This import single of ""I Can't Catch You"" contains the Ben Grosse Remix, followed by the Tommy D. Remix Edit, and then the album version."
5,Please !,"Some reviews simply don't do justice to this great album. If you are open minded about music you will like this record. It's true... it has a lot of strange modern sounds... so what? This is music freedom in a way a lot of jazz pioneers would have done if they were alive today... Brett is a pioneer of modern electric guitar, so is T.J. I cannot wait to hear their next album !"
5,Cool Tunes,I have been listening to Fusion for last 30 years. This CD makes it happening for me each time I listen to it.
3,Not ground breaking.... good,"Yeh, Yeh, Yeh,There are spots of adventure, but the over all compositions are not that honed. I think that the musicianship is great, but there seemed to be more of a ""Jam Band"" approach in the music.Maybe that was the intention... either way... it's good.Dennis Chambers lights it up on another (of many) CD's and is kind of the focal point/ or the facilitator of the feel on the majority of the tracks. So.. inclosing if you dig Dennis... pick it up... Peace"
2,What's the point?,"Oh dear, one of the most interesting bass players around has got himself lost in a one-off band that on paper promises much but aimlessly fires one chop after the other without delivering coherence in content or overall record structure. This is a prime example of why fusion music has got itself stuck in a rut since the last twenty or so years with few exceptions. The novelty of it is long gone and it is being recycled uncreatively. Fast show off licks don't compensate. Time that Gary Willis revived Tribal Tech or did a complete project with John Scofield (listen to the two on Dennis Chambers' record ""Outbreak"", now that is wow-music!)."
5,The title itself is suggestive of the failure of communism.,The book is must for a history as well as philosophy students. In this book you will find how at one time Author is facinated by communism turned against it after finding it very oppressive.
3,American Tax Dollars at Work,"This is perhaps the most celebrated anti-communist book of all time. Incidentally, it was created using your tax dollars. The odd thing is that all of the contributors are very clear about why they left the Party, but still a bit confused as to whether the chimera they were pursuing in the first place was a good thing or not. One could get the impression that the main problem with communism is that the wrong people were in charge. This seems to be the basic position of the New Left. In reality, the only thing that communism and social planning with effective power have ever produced in abundance is human suffering and dead bodies. This is a very important book, not only for what it's writers have to say about communism, but for what their essays reveal about them. Pay close attention do what they do NOT say as well as what they say."
4,3ds max:video Training CD,"A very helpful training cd, it tell you step by step to create the face, and also teach you different kind of techniques such as surface tools, box modeling and NURBS.I strongly recommend this cd for the people who really want to be an expert on model builing."
5,Absoutely Essential for the serious learner,"This CD has greatly improved my modelling skills and knowledge in max. It is like having a teacher there showing you and explaining every step, with the advantage of rewinding as many times as you need to. I would recommend this to the beginner of max modelling. It has certanily helped me out a long way. And Tim Kugler provides great support as well.What are you waiting for, go buy a copy!Shan J"
2,Dissapointed,"Get some reading glasses prior to purchase. you will need them to see the poor quality photos generated by this device.Should have been an electric razor that takes notes.Very bulky. Sony makes some great IC recorders bot this is not one of them. I put it back in the box. Get the Sony ICD-sx46 with the Naturally Speaking software instead.I have had two so far and they work well.As an alternative,Cannon allows you to attach voice notes to photos on some cameras.Someone at Sony should revisit this design especially at the cost of this device.M"
4,Very useful,"This is one of the better books to explain both NTSC, PAL and digital measuring tools such as vector scopes. I found it very useful. It complements well training materials you find from Tektronix. Presentation is similar. There are a few tests that could use a more thorough explanation but most will tell you how to troubleshoot and setup video and audio equipment."
3,BB product,Expected more for a BB product. It works well. But does not smell particularly good or does anything particularly special to my hair. I've purchased other BB products and have been very satisfied. This one is just ok.
3,sunday soap,This product makes your hair feel refreshed after a long week or styling and products. It felt like a nice Sunday hair soap that really got my hair free of impurities after I rinsed it. The shampoo reminded me of soap because it has a good amount of suds and smelled clean.
3,it's okay.,I am not so sure that I would order this again. Seems as though my hairdresser gave me something that worked just as well and certainly is not as expensive.
2,Really strong product so use wisely,"Updated review (8/15/11):Pros: The product does what it claims and gets rid of product build up. It really gets your hair ""squeaky"" clean so if you have a lot of product build up, then this will definitely get the job done and remove it.Cons: However, this product stripped my hair of critical moisture and nutrients. I only used the product 1 time several months ago and my hair has not recovered since. Since then my hair is not as healthy or moisturized and I have experienced unusual breakage. I definitely cannot imagine using this on my hair again.Overall, I have mixed feelings about the product. It does what it claims but I think it damaged my hair. Definitely would not recommend for processed or fine hair."
5,Best clarifying shampoo ever,"I've tried several clarifying shampoos, including the acclaimed Fekkai Apple Cider one, and B+B's is absolutely the best for my hair, which is fine but tends to need a lot of moisture. I love using this and following with a masque-type conditioner. My hair is shiny and soft after using this shampoo, yet I can still go 2 full days before my next shampoo without getting oily roots. I can't say how this would work for very thick hair, but for my fine, somewhat dry, sort of frizz-prone hair this stuff is a great once-a-week treat."
3,PREVINed,"I am 48 years old and have listened to Korngold film music since I was twenty. I had second thoughts about buying...I just had to listen to Previn`s version to hear for myself.Having listened to the original recordingsand watching the movies, I think this CD is an absolute PASS.As sedate as Sedares, Previn has done poorly especially on thebrass tracks. The tempo is just not up to the mark. One reviewerdescribed some tracks as sleepy. I couldn`t agree more.The vibrant and dynamic Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk areterrible let-downs...I don`t think anyone has been able to matchhis conducting skill except maybe Lionel Newman`s collector`sitem CD The Foremost Composer from Hollywood.To film music die-hards, I must say: AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Ifyou listen to the CD for the first time to discover Korngoldthen you`ve been shortchanged.Maybe Mauceri should try to match Korngold. And please, dropthe pedestrian pop tempos."
2,Borrow It From The Library,Spiritless conducting by Previn and mediocre playing by the orchestra spoil the pleasure of my listening to these wonderful scores. Good recording and documentation make this item worth borrowing from the library.
5,Good CD,"Service was excellent. I have been enjoying this CD. It is of good quality, and the CD was received as scheduled."
5,"Shine of Me: The Biography of an African American Woman, Bo","Shine on Me : The Biography of an African American Woman, Born Blind is a must read for all generations. It is filled with intense, colorful characters which explore and celebrate life and love. This extraordinary debut expertly illustrates how a woman, an African American woman, with four strikes embraces her struggles and with the power of love and faith turns them into triumphs."
5,Voices from the Heavens,I am grateful to the anonymous individual or individuals responsible for having written these remarkable pieces. I can only imagine what it might have been like to live in Midieval Hungary and feel inspired to create music so profound and timeless. If God did hear them I can only imagine him/her/it stunned by their beauty.How nice it is to live in a time when music such as this can be made available for our listening pleasure by the wonderfully talented and dedicated people of the Anonymous 4 and the technicians who make such recordings possible.So many people have come together in the course of 1000 years or so to make a CD like this possible.I salute you all for you contribution to this effort. It is a thing of beauty.
5,Wonderful Album,"I heard a cut from this album on a Celtic music show I listen to on a local radio station every Saturday, called Celtic Nation (the station's web site is [...], if you want to stream it). Once again I heard something there I had to hear more of, so got this album. I like it more each time I listen to it. Rooted in Celtic, but travelling to some unexpected places, it hasn't yet failed to satisfy me. Recommended!"
3,"Works for gooseneck, but not with fifth wheel adapter",I bought this to use with the Putnam fifth wheel adapter. I was disapointed with its performance and with the installation kit for my 2005 GMC. It would probably be OK as just a gooseneck hitch and may have a better fit kit for other vehicles.
4,Footprints Of Prince Hall Masonry In New Jersey: The Source And Course Of Ancient Craft Masonry Among Prince Hall Freemasons In,"Because of some missing pieces lost to time and poor note taking by some past secretaries, some parts of this story can only be assumed. Mr. Cooper put those missing pieces together masterfully and wrote an as complete documentary as possible."
2,No,This artist was discovered in Miami my home state. His first album which contained the hit One Night Stand was excellent. He sounds smooth and soulful. His next album in 2005 was a hit with the single Somethings Going On with JT Money. This album though sucks and has no singles. I would not suggest it to anyone and he needs to get a new beat maker.
4,Great Book!,For one I have read a book about what the life of a twenty something year old girl is like. This book tells about a real american struggling female instead of the fairy tale perfect life of a female I have read in other books. This book is a great one! It is funny yet sad and unusuall. I suggest this book to anyone who wants a good laugh and a look into others lives.
3,Energetic and Entertaining in Style but Ultimately Stale,"This is ultimately the standard tale of a woman whose past is shameful to her finding her roots and making peace with her self and her past. Very exciting read via the engergetic style but I'd like to be really surprised someday, and I'd like to see a woman who doesn't ""heal"" by deciding she may be able to fulfil her ""biological destiny"". Wonderful use of traditional style and an unfortunate use of traditional image of women."
4,Such a good book,"I truly enjoyed Not Ready for Prime Time. I picked the book up at the library and I couldn't put it down. I had not read a book in a long time and this book made me want to read again. Justine, the main character made me laugh, cry and wonder what was coming next. I'd recommend this book to anyone."
4,Julian Marley is pure RASTA!!!,Yes Irie Mon!!! He lives up to the family name. Julian Marley represents roots and dancehall styles on Lion in the Morning. Some songs start out slow but build up nicely by the end. Good beats and great for all occasions!!!Recommended
1,Awful,"Pros-Having it operate on batteries is actually kind of nice in comparison to cords.-The vacuum works great, and it's easy to clean.Cons-The battery pack makes it large, and incredibly clumsy to hold.-The blade's at a bad angle which means you have to awkwardly run it across your face for it to actually cut any hairs-I have to keep my beard very trim and like precise lines. Because it's so large, awkward to hold, and not sharp at all, I can't get any precision on my neck and cheek lines. It's hard to see exactly what I'm doing because of how big it is and how awkwardly you have to hold it. and it left my actual beard really patchy all over.-The blade trimmer itself is pretty long and makes going for any type of precision impossible.Don't get this if you actually want to keep your beard or mustache trimmed and neat looking."
1,"Useless, and possibly dangerous!","I ordered this for my husband as my #1 annoyance is him leaving stubble all over the sink. I was so excited when it arrived! However when he tried it out, the vaccuum didn't seem to be working at all... strange I thought, let's try some different batteries (we had just put in the batteries that came with it). When we opened it up the batteries were super hot, and the plastic coating of one of them had begun to melt! Good that he stopped when he did - as if he had kept going it is likely the whole thing would have melted or worse. I'm guessing that's not meant to happen... Surely these things are tested before they ship? Totally dangerous. I have sent it back for a refund and will be getting the Philips one instead."
4,Clipper Review,"The Wahl 5571-500 vacuum beard trimmer cuts very well and surprisingly the vacuum actually works. Some hairs invariably escape the vacuum but most end up in the easy to empty, pull-out chamber. More importantly the clipper head has a number of easy to adjust ""depth of cut"" settings that make getting a consistent beard easy and accurate. I would have given this a five star rating except for the size-the vacuum feature makes the trimmer thicker in the handle than the old, non-vacuum model I had. However, it is still a very nice trimmer that I would highly recommend."
3,Okay,"I ordered two books about John Belushi. Both appeared to be original copies and were yellowed with age. Other than this, the books were in good condition."
5,"Warm, witty & wise","When I grow up, I want to be like Mrs. Greenthumbs!This book doesn't have any glossy photos - just so much practical gardening information that it's the BEST gardening book I ever read (and I've read many, many, many). Cassandra Danz shares her successes - and her failures - and hard-learned lessons in a funny, easy-to-read, month-by-month format. I LOVE this!!!"
2,Where will authors stop to find a new twist ?,The mystery part is totally unbelievable. The lesbian sex scene probably less so. The author should find another genre to discuss her/his insights than the fairly clearly defined genre that mystery is
1,Burned out,Burned out the first time I used and hasn't worked since. Lasted about 10 minutes. I bought a $15 Weller 40 watt soldering iron at my local hardware store to replace this one and that has been working fine.I do not recommend this product.
2,Best of the worst,I got carried away and purchased a bunch of went nowhere power pop groups based on reviews. All of them were terrible and I learned a valuable lesson; I would have sent them back if I could. This was the best of the worst
4,Great example of 80's guitar rock!,"Outside of PA, Tommy is a relative unknown. This CD is an excellent listen if you are into straight-up, rootsy, guitar-based rock. Sounded great in the 80's and it still sounds great today."
2,Too Many Mistakes,"I'm new to Final Cut and I thought this was an OK tutorial but it seems rushed. The instructor is good, speaks well and the screen captures are fine. But there are a number of mistakes such as missing infomation (section 10.5 the latching information is missing) duplicate information(Section 11.3 he exports to MPEG 4 twice) and other glitches like this. Also, they will not honor their money back guarentee unless you buy this from them directly. I probably won't be buying other products from this company."
4,a beautiful book,"Fleda Brown Jackson's poetry touched my heart. I do not have a sister and yet when I shared ""Michelle"" with my friend Jana and watched tears come to her eyes I knew it was good. I do not own a lake house, yet her intricate glimpses of family at leisure (but still carrying their own unique problems and personalities) spoke to me. I teach AP junior English; I know and appreciate Dickinson, Cummings, and Eliot. I also enjoy the poetry of Ms. Jackson; I can't wait to read her other book."
1,America's Most Boring Book,Nothing captivates me in this book of trite words placed in conjunction to produce an effect. What the author aimed for was the poetic but what she hit was the rump of Morpheous which quickly vented its cloud of sleep upon the reader.
3,Now That's What I Call Dance (Import),"This album is a must for anyone who is into the EuroDance scene! However if you are looking to collect due to the ""Now That's What I Call Music"" title, then you might want to reconsider. Overall the album has a lot of catchy dance tracks and would be an excellent addition for the DJ who is looking for something a little wild, different and exciting!"
4,another good Gregory book,I enjoy all Phillippa Gregory books and this was no exception. The romantic relationships were a bit different from her usual but I believe historically valid. I also liked all the references to plants since I am a gardener too.
3,good... but I don't care about the details of gardening,"I love Philippa Gregory, but this wasn't as good as the others. This book was good in itself but long, one and two-page explanations about gardening was a little too lengthy."
3,a little bit more worn than I expected,I bought this used but it was a little bit more worn than I expected. I may be a little picky though as my own books are always well kept. Service was fine and I'm satisfied
3,Earthly Joys,"Interesting historically of times during and after the Reformation, but a bit repetitive at times. Sometimes difficult to relate to the characters even though it was a lesson on all the different ""loves"" that can exist. Written well and certainly kept one interested in the story."
4,a surprise book for garden lovers,"This was such a surprise and quite different from Ms Gregories other books.Her style is easy to read with plenty of titillation but the content of how John Tradescant superceded politics and traveled the unknown globe exploring, searching for new species of plants was truly fascinating. Tradescant was the gardener for the Stuarts, James I,Charles I and after the restoration for Charles II.I learned so much about how plants were discovered and the birth of gardening.This book would appeal more to those with an interest in the history of the garden and the plants they love."
1,"Boring, disappointing rubbish.","As an avid fan of all other novels by Philippa Gregory, I was terribly let down by this one. Unless you are a gardener or botanist interested in the origins of English gardening, there is nothing remotely interesting about this story. And even the historical facts, which are usually so masterfully intertwined with the plot in Gregory's other books, are given very little attention. The main focus is on the characters, but the characters never change or grow or learn from past experience. One theme is established at the outset of the book, and it just continues in the same dull vein until the end. Stuck with it because of how much I loved her other work, but I'm sorry that I wasted weeks of reading on this dud."
3,A Man's Constant Search,"After reading several of Gregory's other works, I was excited about this one. It was refreshing for her to take on a male lead character. Although the subject is interesting, it's hard for a modern-day person to believe that the main character would follow his employer and/or travel to far reaches to find different plants to the detriment of his own family.The book tends to get bogged down in some of the descriptions of the gardens and doesn't really develop the characters as much as I would have liked. It's hard to really like Tradescant. He may have the love of his employers, but he doesn't seem to earn the love of his family or the reader."
2,weird,"Have enjoyed her other books. this book proves that ""company men"" live in all ages. Career is just more fun than familys.the book wanders like a vine, not a good first choice read."
1,earthly joys,"I have read all of Phillipa Gregory's books, and always eagerly await her next, but this was a miss. I was very disappointed in this stilted, boring book...I can only imagine that it is enjoyable to garden enthusiasts. Unlike Gregory's other novels, which have unexpected twists and enough action to keep one interested, 'Joys' drags on, with pages and pages devouted solely to plant descriptions. Gregory's attempt at some sort of 'love connection' between the gardener and his master is completely unromantic. I encourage anyone who likes this genre to read Phillip Gregory's work-just don't bother with this one."
2,Earthly Joys,I love Philappa Gregory but was disappointed with this book. The book took unexpected turn that was rather disqusting so I would not recommend it.
3,Disappointing lead character,"I am in the midst of reading ""Earthly Joys"" and out of all the books this author has written that I have read, I have been the most disappointed. Maybe it is because I enjoy her books that have a dynamic female character as the center of the action as in ""The Other Bolyn Sister"" or ""The Queen's Fool."" Both those books are outstanding. This one falls so short because the main character, John, insists on staying loyal at all costs -- including going against his conscience, his common sense, any kind of sense at all. Maybe this was what really happened back then with the person this was patterned after. And it is a good lesson for all who read this -- to think and to stay true to oneself. But, I haven't grown to love this character at all. I am saddened by him. I am very irritated with him. I will finish the book and I hope the ending is outstanding because the rest of the book isn't."
3,Unexpected,"This book was a little unexpected for me coming from Phillippa Gregory. Most of her books are about strong women and their relationships with the men who made history. This book did contain some of the scandalous elements that I expected after reading her other works, but it was not as much to my taste. It could be that it is more difficult for her to portray a man as a central figure. This book was just ""ok,"" but the sequal was better."
2,A Little disappointing.....,If you have really loved the other boleyn girl by the same author...then this book will be disappointing as it does not have the thrill factor like the other one did. This book failed to engage me and I had to put it down several times. The author must have done extensive research but emphasis is done more on the plants/garden than on the actual story. I Usually finish reading off an entire novel within 3-4 days but this one has been laying around for the last 3-4 weeks!
4,Over-The-Top-But Very Entertaining,"I enjoy a good revenge movie as well as the next guy, but, holy smokes, this crosses the line a little bit with the glorification of it...at least with the ending (which I won't give away but involves Sharon Stone's character).Whatever, the film features an entertaining tale of a revenge-obsessed woman (Stone) who hires Sylvester Stallon (The Specialist, a term for his bomb-making talents) to kill all the people responsible for her parents' murder years earlier.The villains are over-the-top, to say the least. One almost has to laugh out loud at one of them: James Woods. Few people have been better at playing despicable villains than Woods, and in this film he plays that role to the hilt. He also rattles off the best line in the movie when he tells some tourist to ""get a new shirt, too.""Some of the bombing scenes are quite memorable, such as a chunk of a condo building falling into the ocean.If revenge is to your liking, this is your cup of tea - a big cup!"
3,Decent Stallone Action Drama,"A little less over the top than most of Stalione's films and I prefer the over the top efforts (such as Demolition Man). This one rates 'pretty good' for story, action, pace, characters. It makes an effort to blur the line between good and bad but doesn't come off as serious as it seems to want to be."
2,"another action movie, only for Sylvester Stallone, yet...","The movie does not have much talks as before for Sylvester Stallone, which is still working for this star. Small amount of the talks give very dramatic effects for Sylvester Stallone. The plot is kind of boring. But, viewing Sylvester Stallone is always a treat. Sharon Stone was not acting. No one really acted, but the entire setting was acted. It created an impression that the movie story is a part of the long stories that are told together for an epic of the '90's till 2005. And, the epic bores the audience. Strangely, the appearance of Sylvester Stallone in the epic seemed not bore the audience."
4,Loved it!,"Stars, action, Florida filming location, high energy Spanish beat music by Emilio/Gloria Estavan. All of the ingredients for an enjoyable movie fantasy, plus the wardrobe and style of Sharon Stone for Stone lovers."
1,The second worst film I have ever seen,"It was the worst until I saw Batman and Robin. I think this screenplay was submitted as some kind of sick joke. The dialogue is ridiculous, and the plot simply did not exist.Maybe it is supposed to be ironic?"
1,Still gives me nightmares,Stallone made the biggest mistake of his career by agreeing to do this movie. It just doesn't work. Its utter trash . Stallone doesn't deliver any kind of Rocky or Rambo performance here. Instead we are treated to a silly plot with lots of holes. I cringe every time this film's name is mentioned.
1,NO CHEMISTRY AT ALL,There is no chemistry at all between Sly and Stone in this movie. But this is not the main reason for the failure of this garbage. WOods is very bad as the villain (one of the few times he is not good) and the script is a total mess. The producers wished that the appeal of putting Sly and Stone together would be sufficient.
4,about the movie the specialist......,Another good action flick movie/film. A good recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film but to mention that Sharon Stone makes herself sexy in this movie/film. Enjoy....
3,Blu Ray Review,"The Specialist in blu ray is simply gorgeous. The colors, clarity and sound is outstanding. Its not a great movie, but its a good popcorn movie to watch on a Saturday night.Worth adding to your collection."
4,Clever with bombs...,"I can't explain what it is that I truly like about this movie other than how a couple of the characters are so knowledgeable about the blasts they want, and who they want to be hurt by them!! Just love the explosions!!!!"
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I don't agree with all the naysayers as to the merits of this movie. I saw a very different view of Sylvester Stallone (especially the love-making scene with Sharon Stone). Beautifully and tactfully done and the movie was chock full of action. It was nice to see the bad guys get some retribution this time, esp. from a young girl who witnessed the brutal slaying of her mother and father. Well thought out, well-produced and well-acted."
3,"Just another action-""like"" movie","I must admit that I am fond of Stallone's movies.Not all but few.The same applies for Stone's.I am not going to discuss or criticize the plot, play and atmosphere of the movie. After all too many people had already done that.All I have to say is why a mid 90's movie is presented in 4:3 format on DVD? I just cannot get it.Enjoy!"
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible cartoon of a movie. I couldn't believe how badly acted, directed and written it was. It was like a really bad TV movie. Actually, I've never seen a TV movie as bad as this one. And at least TV movies are free...."
2,Sharon Stone is hot,"The action is not the idea in this movie, it is the big shower scene. It is so sexy!!!! The music also makes it better... IF you like good shower scenes get this one other wise don't the action and everything else is out of wack."
1,WHAT A TURKEY !,"Combined by the wrong reasons (money), the union between Stallone and Stone flopped, was a total failure, one of the worst Sly movies ever. Everything here is misplaced, misdirected, wrong."
1,"Woods, shame on you","Stallone's worst film ever, even worse than Stop, or my mom will shoot. Sharon Stone gives possibly the worst performance of 1990's. Stallone looks a bit out of place because even he is too good for a movie like this. As for a dynamic quality actor like James Woods, he really should be ashamed of himself for taking any part in this film."
1,If you want to SEE Sharon Stone--get Basic Instinct.,"In my opinion, Sly's worst movie! Just when Antonio Banderas was coming off high from Desperado....this movie all but destroyed him! As for Sharon Stone? The shower scene was halarious...but I don't think that was the director's intention. Oh who cares, if you want a good comedy, rent it. But if you want an action flick, you're better off watching cartoons on TV."
1,THE SPECIALIST IN BAD MOVIES...,"I'm only joking, because I know Sly has made great action movies in his fabulous career. Bu in this one he completely dropped the ball, and everyone involved knows that!"
4,great cast with a great story!!!!!,"liked this film as it has a great cast with a great story, stallones character makes you want to be a specialist. would defo recommend this movie to any stallone fan or action fanatic, :)"
4,The same great music that I remembered.,The record is great if your a Britny Foxx fan or just enjoy rock n roll. I recommend this record to everyone. Its really an under rated record.
5,Awesome,"I love this item, when I ordered I had to return it because it was a gift for my dad for Christmas(2008) and my sister-in-law bought it for him before I did so instead of my dad having a second copy of it I returned mine and she got it for him. The important thing is, is that he got it for Christmas and loved it and listens to it all the time, esp.the track ""Girls School"". Anyway thanks to amazon for having the item in stock :)"
4,"not the best dr dolittle book, but entertaining","gub-gub is one of my favorite dr dolittle characters. his book, selections from his ""encyclopaedia of food"", is entertaining, although it reads less like a dr dolittle book and more like roald dahl. most of the stories are kind of whimsical parodies, so there's a story about a famous food detective named ""sherbet scones"" and a three-part ""epicnic"" about a ""Picnic King"". there's also a recount of ""the war of the tomatoes"". there's some funny dialogue among the other animals as they comment on the stories. overall this a decent read if you love dr dolittle, although i imagine some of the stories would be less engaging for kids than the other dr dolittle books."
4,Good!,"Three CDs for a very attractive price and 2,5 hours of beautifull music.Especially part1(violin,harp and euphonium) and part3(solo piano) are good.If you like Wim Mertens,don't miss it!"
5,this is a must to read,I read this book when it first came out and I love Rosemary Altea. I gave this book to many friends to read and all came back with how accurate it was. It also explained to me why some of my friends were the way they were even being the same zodiac sign but how completely different we were. To this day I still recommend the book to my many students to read
3,An average read,"From the back cover:Would she become his part-time wife?How could Elexa stop her family bugging her about finding a ""nice"" man to marry? Right now, she wanted to concentrate on her career. The solution arrived in the shape of wealthy businessman Noah Peverelle, who wanted a son, but who had no time for emotional entanglements. Impulsively Elexa accepted when Noah proposed.But their convenient, part-time marriage wasn't working out as planned. For one thing, Elexa made the mistake of falling in love with her husband...And my review:A typical Harlequin theme: the marriage of convenience for some reason that somehow turns to love. And to keep sex in the mix, one of them wants a child. Not very memorable or amazing, but okay to kill a couple of hours."
5,Wonderful!!!,"Another winner by Jessica Steele. She continues to create stories and characters that make for great reading. You won't be sorry if you buy this book. I read it in one sitting, because I couldn't stop until I finished it. Wonderful book!"
3,"Full Featured, but not very bright","Lots of bells and whistles, but even in the brightest setting, the beam just doesn't compare to other headlamps I have, so buy it if you need it's special features, but not if you're looking for a strong beam."
4,You get a lot for your money in this little gem.,"This is a terrific little inexpensive book on hydrangeas. It was published in 2001/2002 by a New Zealand horticulturist. The pictures are luscious and most are labeled with specific variety names. However, this is not just a coffee table book. It contains easy to understand, accurate information on growing hydrangeas. The chapter on pruning is excellent and includes a section on pruning tree form hydrangeas. I would highly recommend this book."
3,"Music that's off the beaten path - especially ""Thriller!""","In all honesty, this album can be rather irritating to me if I'm not in the right mood for it. Thomas' bizarre caterwauling is unique to say the least, but it's very expressive. I'm sure this music would've been more of a revelation to me if I could've heard it when it first came out. It's pretty fun when I feel like hearing it though.Conversely, I really like weird, unique, otherworldly music and therefore I really dig the ""Thriller!"" track. Without a doubt, it is really trippy. It starts off meandering rather aimlessly in a spacey jazzy sort of way and is soon overcome by some sort of alien rhythmic frequency. A while back I made some old tapes of the strangest music I could find (Faust, Cabaret Voltaire) and ""Thriller!"" always made the cut."
5,favorite one,"This is my favorite album by these guys they manage to experiment while being weird and original. Only one song I don't particularly care for and that's ON THE SURFACE. That main keyboard or synth or whatever instrument that is is just plain annoying. My favs are I WILL WAIT, NAVVY, THRILLER, DRINKNG WINE, UBU DANCE, and DUB HOUSING buy this u will see why."
5,Explains the dynamics clearly,I read this book a couple of weeks of taking over my first church. This book saved my job (and the church). It made me ask the questions that I needed to ask and allowed me to avoid some of the pitfalls of change.
5,Not enough stars,"There aren't enough stars. This CD rates at least seven. What these women do is incredible, of course; but in this CD they reveal that rock and roll was invented in Cluny around 1150. Oh sure, you're saying to yourself that this clown is employing dramatic license in the extreme. But I challenge you to listen to track 8: Brief responsory before you dismiss this idea out of hand. Get 'em while you can. They will soon be snapped up by a Motown label and you'll have to put up with a blues backbeat.Four Angels came down to Earth and are making music for us."
5,A real miracle,"Certainly, I am not being original, if I say that the way Anonymous 4 sing in this record is itself a real miracle, but I am just telling an obvious truth.In ""Miracles of Santiago"", the performers almost reach a level of divine perfection, guiding the listener to a state of pure spiritual peace, carrying him to an era where our western cultural heritage dives some of her deepest roots.A wonderful record that I highly praise and recommend to everybody."
1,dont buy it,"the bass is no good at all, and the enclosure came losse, i had to readjust the screws since they were making a really bad noise, and the enclosure doesnt help to much the bass. At the end i had to by a new bass with a new enclosure. Its a waste of money!!!"
3,Bought for my wife.,"Bought for my wife. I think she likes it, but I don't use it so it is difficult to say."
1,Stings,"I love the smell of this but it stings my face. That led me to read the ingredients more carefully - two kinds of alcohol are within the first few ingredients. So, no wonder it stings. I want a soothing mask I can use often to help with dry, premature aging, skin. Since this stings I wouldn't want to use it -- I'm sending it back and will keep looking for another mask."
3,Not truly a story,"This book is basically a print version of Mr Valenti's diary. There is no true narrative, instead it's a random assembly of his thoughts and writings on what he experienced. Very stop and go type reading.If you are looking for a true narrative on what its like to be a combat medic, you'll have to look elsewhere."
2,Lets hope the next biographer does better,"The usefulness of this biography of the greatest art critic of the 20th Century is fatally compromised by its unfortunate tendency to use rumor, innuendo and the undependable testimony of disgruntled art world second-raters to cast Greenberg as an nasty, abusive all-around bad character.I knew him for 35 years. He was sometimes cranky and disputatious, but he was also gentle, civil and always helpful, and he went out of his way to crit my paintings and listen to and tolerate my bitching and complaining about the art world. I do not recognize the man I knew in this book. Lets hope the next biographer does better"
5,Great!,"Since I play the hammered dulcimer I am a big fan of Maggie Sansones music.This CD is very diverse, from guitar solos to slow dances, although most of these are reels that make you want to tap your feet to the rythm. Some have interesting percussion instruments such as bones, dombek and finger cymbals. If you enjoy any hammered dulcimer music you'll enjoy this CD and her other hammered dulcimer music CD, Mist & Stone."
3,"Understanding Zora Neale Hurstong's Their Eyes Were Watching God: A student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Document",This book has some very useful essays that raise questions regarding the issues raised by the story. The essays are interesting to read. At the end of each section there are reference materalsi for further study as well as discussion questions. It is useful as a resource and background information for the novel.
4,"A great perspective on the ""end times"".","Originally my wife bought this book. I'm not into Revelations books myself since I think that mostly the authors' analysis is clouded by current events and/or their cultural world view. What makes this book so great is that it comes from Arthur's love for the Lord. From reading the pages of this book I sense a deep, consistent and mature faith that has originated not from the dusty halls of academia but from experience.Not to say that this work is somehow a ""Revelations for Dummies"". Quite the opposite it respects the complexities of the final book of the bible yet outlines them in a succinct way in which the reader will be able to recall the outline or main points of the book.If I were to fault this book it would be in the writing style. Sometimes I felt it a little long winded, some points expounded on a little too long. Yet if you push on through some of that you get to a lot of great teaching and significant truths."
3,Pretty good..,"This is one of the better, 'End-Times' outlines I've read and I've read over 50. Moral warnings predominate. A few dry moments."
4,Flamenco and onward.,"The singing on this disk is great, and the guitar playing is great. Both musicians have been active since they were about 12.This CD is a brilliant development of flamenco music, involving some jazz and other influences without ever sounding contrived. Fans of flamenco with an ear for the progressive will like it. So will fans of Piazzola and Threadgill...Peace out"
5,Best for Intro to Crowley's Work,"When I first decided to read Crowley, I started with ""Eight Lessons in Yoga"" which left me a bit bewildered as to terminology. But when I found Book 4, it explained everything, and I truly began to understand some of Crowley's thinking. This book is what gave me a deep appreciation for his work, his philosophy, his magick, everything. I tend to take notes as I read, and I ended up with 23 pages of notes on the chapter on the wand alone. For the aspiring mage, this book is inspiring and motivating! P.S. When talking to Thelemites, do not confuse this book with Liber Aba, which is also referred to as Book 4. This one is the ""little Book 4"" which is a chapter in Liber Aba."
3,Poorly arranged,"Crowley had a habit of writing books in a very difficult to understand manner. This book is no different. I use this book as a reference though, as it has a veritable cornucopia of info on many different types of eastern and western philosophies ie Yoga, astrology, etc. I wouldn't advise anyone read this book as an introduction into the occult though, because it can be very confusing, and it has many contradictions. Still, his work is well researched and he provides some wonderful poetry."
2,Not the complete Book 4,"Book 4 in its entirety is comprised of 4 parts in all modern editions. This is simply part 2. It is good information, but it should clearly be marked as only containing the one part. I had wanted part 3 personally."
4,Another aid for my aching shoulder,"I continue to deal with an aching shoulder (possibly rotator cuff injury?). Different stores have different brands of patches to help out. This is the third of three brands that I have tried--Ben Gay and Activon are the two others. Each has provided symptomatic relief, which is my main goal now.And, I must say, Icy Hot Patch is pretty comparable in its effect on the discomfort. So, as I try to directly address the underlying problem with exercise, these products help by reducing the pain and discomfort.So, I'm pretty satisfied. . . ."
4,Original equipment is always the best choice,"This was original equipment, I got what I wanted and what I ordered. This is original equipment made for my color printer. I am happy with this transaction"
3,Decent product / hard to dispose,"I use these at work, for Ricoh / Lanier printers and corporate-grade multifunction machines. Generally, the performance, cost per page, and service contracts are pretty good. The systems work as advertised, but duty cycles tend to be over-stated.My primary negative is recycling these. There is no recycling label in the box to return ship (like most big vendors do with Toner).If you have existing or new rules about disposal of these things, keep that in mind before you buy.Sometimes, I feel like we are ""stockpiling trash"" until we can find a safe(safer) way to dispose of this legally. This is not convenient, and is definitely a deal breaker for me.I won't sign any future contracts for lease or purchasing - unless the vendors guarantee a path for recycling. I don't even mind paying a little extra, or for postage."
2,"Not ""Tree of Heaven""","A disappointing read after ""Tree of Heaven."" I felt that the sub-plots detracted from the main storyline of the book. After a slow start, the book had confusing threads: part self-indulgent confession, part folk tale. I was frustrated by this lack of focus, plus the entire hermetic writer theme. I just couldn't sympathize or empathize with most of the characters. They seemed curiously flat. I had a feeling about the way the book was going to end, and was disappointed to be right. Couldn't tell if I just didn't ""get it"" or if it was really not that great of a read."
5,DVD Format PULEEZE,"I love the show and own DVDs for seasons one and two. I really would like to have season three on DVD. I know old way... but then my life will then be complete.I love the scenery of flying above Alaska and running a regional airline. I really miss this show. It was the only show that I would plan to be in front of the diodes for.I am glad for the Tweato family, they did not go all Hollywood and are just good people. They really became members of the family and you genuinely cared for them. It is what reality TV should be. Their lives are full enough of danger, they didn't need much help from producers. What happened to all the aircraft series? There are a lot of pilots out here that crave the stuff."
5,Great show,I wish they would keep going with the show. I love it.Highly recommend this video series to anyone who loves flying.
4,One of the books that I reach for the most,"I collect baking cookbooks and I have many. This book is one I reach for often. There are a few of my favorite recipes in here. The White Birthday Cake Frosting is the BEST! I make it all the time and always get raves about it. There is also a Raspberry Cheesecake Bar Recipe that is to die for! I give this book only 4 stars because there are recipes in this book that I think are not that great. I bake frequently (a least a few times a week) and therefore I'm pretty familiar with recipes that work and ingredients that work. The recipes that are not that great are few though. No matter what cookbook you buy, you can always expect to like only so many of the recipes either due to personal opinion or the fact that it just might not be a good recipe. I recommend this book if you like good old fashioned baking. Lots of easy recipes and classic recipes. It's inexpensive and has tons of recipes."
3,Attractive but small and does not suction well,Purchased this item. It came from Touch of Europe. It was packaged nicely and is very attractive but was smaller than expected. The problem is that it does not suction well at all. It would not suction well even when the suction cup was wet to the high chair tray or to the wooden dinner table. It suctioned just fine to the kitchen counter - but that's not where the kids eat. :-)We ended up returning the item at our expense (understandable) and the vendor indicated initially a 20% restocking fee and was actually pretty snotty about it all.The item is attractive but you mayfind it does not suction well which was the entire point. But it could have just been us. But we did order three different bowls each with a different design (we have triplets) and all performed the same - so I suspect it is the nature of the product.
2,not satisfied here,The first bottle I used basically just made me swell. I started to fully fill out my A cup and go into a small B. After that if went back down to my original size and haven't budged since. Don't waste your money.
2,It was ok but didn't really work that well..,"After a few weeks of using the product I noticed some firmness but, that was the only thing I noticed aside from noticing my face clearing up but, my breast size didn't change that much.."
3,noticable difference,I had taken these pills before and did notice a difference. I was a 34A and went to a 36B. I didn't even take the whole bottle i stopped taking them because I was really small at the time and didn't want to be all boobs. This product works better then Brest Success.most def.
2,Bleh,"It is one thing when people put ""their"" spin on a tune for recording purposes, everyone wants to be unique, but this a karaoke cd for gosh sakes...at least come close to what Dean did. Unfortunately this was the only CD that had the song ""I Will"" on it."
3,"Great product, advertising a tad misleading.","I use the Barley daily. Super stuff!I've had one of these cups for quite some time which had been offered free as a trial from the manfucturer and have been looking to get more for some time now.I thought, it was offering four of the cups as a ""4 pack.""You get 4 small packs of barley and one cup.Excellent price on the 10 oz canister of Barley as well."
2,TOO SMALL NOT LIKE ADVERTISED,"We were very disappointed with the shakers. They were not like the description at all. we purchesed them to use with the powder for our diet and because they were so small, we had to spend more money and get a blender."
5,Monster HTFS 500 Power Center,"I wanted a power filter to use behind my new 46 inch Z series Sony HDTV and this product fit the bill. I am very pleased with the performance of the television and the peace of mind provided by the power center. I am using it with a recessed electrical outlet. The power center mounts directly to the wall and allows the television to be mounted on the wall with no cords in view. I am not a Monster brand ""junkie"" but this provided the best value for the money via Amazon compared to anything I could have purchased elsewhere."
4,Well Made with One Design Flaw,"I have to agree with Mr. Warrington about the plug. I added a recessed plug behind my 60"" plasma and I can't get the Monster Power Center plug to fit in the socket. I am going to have to remove my plasma from the wall mount and might have to change the wall outlet just to get this thing plugged in. I'm not really upset about that because I was going to take down the TV anyway to paint...but if that were not the case I would be agitated about that."
3,Worth It or Not?,"I purchased this product to protect and compliment my Sony 55"" TV. I can't say if I recommend it or not because I cannot see any difference in the picture quality from the previous surge protector I had. If I had it to do over again, I'd spend the money on one of the larger power centers with mulit inputs and outputs."
5,Find out about the fascinating world of neo-burlesque,I am a fan of burlesque and have seen many of the stars of this movie at burlesque events. The film is a great look into the world of neo-burlesque where creative and confident women (an a few men) are bringing back this uniquely American artform.
3,very good as a cult classic.,"a somewhat funny movie,it's a totally diffrent movie, I really liked it."
5,All you ever thought Chaco's should be,"Perfect shoe/sandal for someone who needs a sturdy pair of sandals. Very comfortable and has great support for your feet. Personally I don't wear flat sandals or flat shoes because it gives me foot pain due to my bad arch, but these give great support. They are perfect and easy to adjust! Plus they look great! I love these Chaco's!!"
4,great shoes!,"I bought these for my trip to Mexico and was very happy with them! They do take a little getting used to - the arch support is pretty high - but the treads are great. Climbing up rocks and things, I never worried about slipping because these sandals grip everything! The only reason I give four instead of five stars: If you get dust or pebbles in these shoes, it's really hard to get them out without taking the entire sandal off, which, on an excursion, isn't always that convenient. Would've given 4 1/2 stars if it were possible. :)"
4,"If you have bunyons, forego the toe strap!","It's not the entire shoes fault that the toe strap is uncomfortable but it was worth docking one star to me.The shoes them selves are great- I don't think this tread will ever wear off and I feel like I'm prepared for nearly anything wherever I go. I do have bunyons and so the toe strap would have been good to forego but I didn't realize it was going to be such an issue. At this point, I just don't put my toe in and I walk on top of it- which sounds a little uncomfortable but I can't tell at all. Overall a great shoe, I just wish I had bought the Z1 model instad of the Z2."
2,Cool shoes but not adjustable enough,I love these shoes in theory. The sole bed is super comfortable but some of the straps are not adjustable and those loops were too big for me. I tried going down a size but then the foot bed is too small. Ugh - I really wanted to keep these shoes but had to send them back
3,Chaco didn't work for my foot,"I had hoped these would work, but they didn't for my foot. The pattern on the foot bed rubbed on my foot too much. The arch reached too far forward on my foot. I felt like I had a bulge pushing against the bottom of the front part of my foot. Just didn't work. I went back to my Teva Toachi (have closed and open toe types). These seem to fit my foot the best. I know they are a great sandal for most folks, but just not for me."
2,Opening for Big Toe Way too small,Cute design and length was perfect. I do not think that I have abnormally big toes but my big toe would not fit into the opening at all. Finally got it in but tight and uncomfortable when walking.
2,too clunky,This shoe is too clunky and the arch is way to high. It gives me blisters on my arch and my big toes are going to fall off. They are good for outdoors and a great concept. I wish they were more dainty.
4,Love Them,"I was unsure about ordering Chacos. So glad I did though, I absolutely love them. Had a little trouble figuring out how to tighten/loosen, but once I got them set, they were perfect."
2,They hurt my feet!,"These are very uncomfortable. I bought them because of already having feet issues/pain, but these only made it worse. The imprint ridges are very annoying."
2,Too Sweet,"Personal preference... too sweet. Tastes like General Foods International Coffees. Price is great if you like that, though. And makes up very easy."
4,"Fun for the kids, but ...","I must agree with all the other reviews. The Gator is loads of fun for my 3 year old son. He drives all day. Battery life is very impressive. It has been over a month of non-stop driving in our yard. Our drive way is loose gravel so it would slip a bit but I took care of that by placing a load on the bed; works great.We started my son on the low gear but he soon found the shifter. This is my only dissapointment with the product. The shifter is made out of plastic, as is the entire vehicle, and not very durrable. It is almost broken off completely from my son shifting. Should be made out of at least solid plastic not hollow...medal would be best for the price tag! Now I am stuck trying to look for a way to fix the shifter.However, other than the shifter problem my son loves it. I am hoping the gears and the tires last :o) from all his driving."
3,Great fun with some flaws,"We bought this for our kids 4 & 5. They love it and enjoy riding it together. It's by far their favorite power toy out of the four they have. The downsides: Poor battery placement which is a pain to change and charge, plastic parts that have broken easily with normal use and a battery that has a very strict maintenance cycle to keep is usable. Even with the drawbacks, we'd buy one again."
4,GRANDSON JACOB'S BIRTHDAY GIFT,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT GIFT FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDSON. BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SEATBELTS AND IT CAME WITHOUT SEATBELTS. PLEASE SEND US THE SEATBELTS.THANK ;YOUCATHY EDINGER3312 FOX HILL DRIVECLEARWATER, FL 33761727-647-0862"
1,Love's Illusion,"Overall: Monotonous, irritating. I had a headache after only three cuts, and the cut I really wanted is barely recognizable as the melody of interest. Let's just say that this is a sound (i.e., all female vocals, no instrumental variety), regardless of performers, that I do not go looking for."
5,dede801,This music appeals to almost everyone. Delightful and inspiring. Even my 4 year old granddaughter has learned to sing along with many of these wonderul Irish songs. When we saw them in concert she danced in the aisle and has decided to learn to play the violin (fiddle)
5,Spellbinding,These young women have the most fantastic voices ever. Anyone of any age would love their music.
4,Caledonia,I really bought the CD for one song after watching their live in concert on our local Public Broadcast. I just fell in love with the song Caledonia. Every time I hear the song it makes me feel like smiling.The whole CD is wonderful!! I would hightly recommend it to anyone who likes Celtic music. The Live concert is also sold too!
2,Great voices,"Although these women have great singing voices the music sounds as if it was created by Disney. If you are a fan of and own the Lion King CD you will love this CD. I was looking more for music like the Midevil babes, who I like because of there style of music and beutiful voices but this is not it. I was looking forward to this music since I heard one song on PBS. Should have investigated more."
3,Good listening but not as good at the 1st,"While I am enjoying this CD, it was a little disappointing that some of the songs from the TV special were omitted, namely Spanish Lady & At The Ceili. These are traditional Irish songs & should have been included. I do appreciate the lyrics having been included."
4,Enjoy it and recommend it but not as fantastic as the original,The music is excellent and I enjoy the CD. However it seems more production oriented than individual voices shining on their own. The original Celtic Woman had a special sound in each song and I find myself flipping around the New Journey songs to get the ones I really like. Still - I highly recommend it.
5,Interest Keeper,The voices are beautiful as is the song choice--nice mix of familiar and not so familiar. A must for Irish music lovers esp. Enya.
3,CELTIC WOMEN CD,PURCHASED TWO OF THESE. RETURNED ONE. THE PRICE WAS SO COMPETITIVE. WHY LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE.
5,Loved It !,Bought this CD for my daughter (her request - birthday gift)... she absolutely loves it. Nice to see an 18 year old appreciate other types of music - she really enjoys the sound of it.
5,Fantastic,"This CD is an audio treat. If the songs, instrumentation and the voices of these women don't bring chills to your spine then you are probably dead. When PBS brought these wonderful and harmonic voices together they could not have made a better match. I can barely wait for their next CD release. Hear it and believe. I do wish that there were more songs in Gaelic but I still give it five stars plus."
5,This is a great DVD!,The DVD turned out to be better than the PBS special. No comercials.Thanks for the decent price.
5,Get the bonus tracks version!!,"We first purchased the Celtic Woman, A New Journey DVD + CD pacakge and we were very disapointed that the original CD did not include some of the best songs from the DVD. Once we figured out that the songs that we loved were only available on the version with the bonus track we purchased that one. We felt cheated that the original cd was short songs, but on the bright side we now have one CD in each car. It is only an issue as to who is going to get the version with the bonus tracks."
5,Greatest CD ever,"I have never heard such beautiful harmony and vocals! The music was just wonderful! The orchestra was outstanding! I have already decided that ""The Prayer"" is going to be sung at my wedding. I can't help but cry every time I hear that song sung by Chloe (I have already bought the sheet music for it:))There were a couple of songs that got a little boring but for the most part it was GREAT!!! The DVD is magnificent as well! It has about 6 or 7 more songs."
4,Celtic Woman Needs More Fiddle,"I saw the concert at Radio City and was truly WOWED by it. Unfortunately this CD contains mostly soft, quiet songs. They are great, but it needed more of the electricity of the fiddle, drums, etc. Both in the concert and on the CD, the use of non-Celtic music was not needed. There is plenty of ALL Celtic music to handle a concert and CD."
3,Don't like this cd....sorry,"I loved the celtic women CD and DVD. I thought their Christmas CD was lovely but... I really, really didn't like this CD. It has too many lame instrumentals and I hated ""Scarborough Fair"""" and ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"". I have gotten into Celtic music pretty seriously and this CD is just not very celtic. None of the songs really excite me. I feel the song selection for this CD was poorly done. I'm glad to hear that the DVD was better but so what? That dosen't improve this lame CD. Why didn't the better songs get put on this CD."
3,"Celtic Woman, A New Journey",My husband was slightly disappointed with this CD as it doesn't contain many of his favorite songs from the DVD.
5,Memories of my father,"My father was a mason and a carpenter who spent a good portion of his life building homes in the village where he was born and in the neighboring villages. One evening, on his way back home, he heard singing voices of some women. To him - the songs and voices were angelic and never heard before. He decided to wait and see the approaching singers thinking that these singers might be equally angelic beautiful girls as their songs and voices were. To his great disappointment - he met a group of ugly, sweaty, old women going back to their homes from a work in fields. My father died twenty six years ago - but his expectation to see the girls of angelic beauty and voices would be met with the Celtic Woman - for sure."
5,great music,I really like celtic music and like watching it on my large flat screen TV. It is great music. Thank you!!!
5,I can't say enough,I had seen this group on PBS which at that point I got online in Amazon.com and ordered. The music is fabulous and the quick delivery was great as well.
5,Celtic Woman,I purchased this dvd for my daughter and she is very happy with it...she loves it and listens to it over and over again.Thanks.
5,Awesome Celtic Woman,"I had seen the TV special of ""New Journey"" on PBS, and had to get the CD. The voices, the harmonizing, and the music is just outstanding!!! I'm in awe of the talent these ladies have and share! Makes me want to be right there to see and hear this wonderful music!"
5,Just Wonderful!,"Celtic Woman, A New JourneyFrom Start to finish it was a joy, The setting the Music the arrangement the presention. All were perfect.A real joy to watch, listen and enjoy!"
5,Celtic Woman A New Journey,I first saw this a TV and loved it. Now I can watch it when ever I want without any commercials or interruptions!
5,A New Journey,I love the music from this group. It is so lively for some of them but also soothing for some of the other songs
1,Overpriced,"These are excellent drill bits from an manufacturer with an excellent reputation, but at the price I'd expect these bits to make holes by themselves on verbal command. Seriously, Amazon is selling these for 4 or 5 times what good drill bits cost from other sites."
3,Justin Boots,Well they're Justin's so that says alot however I wanted a hard toe boot and that's what I ordered but that's not what I received.
1,Disappointing,For the price this product is very disappointing. It is extremely thin and the quality of the print is less than stellar. It will likely go in the garbage after the first wind next fall. Don't waste your money!
2,"Chintzy, not worth the price","This flag is the lowest-quality garden flag we've ever had.The fabric is very thin (I can see through it) and has a paper-y feel to it. I'm guessing it's only going to last a couple of months.The design is bright, but it's (a) printed, not appliqued and (b) on one side only.Finally, all of our other garden flags are 13"" x 18"" -- this one is 11"" x 15"" and it just looks small on our pole. Admittedly, it says the size in the description, I just didn't realize it was smaller than ""standard.""This was a real disappointment. I'm giving it two stars as the description isn't technically incorrect; I just expected it to be of higher quality."
1,Within a couple of days stones were falling out!,I loved this ring online...after wearing it only two days stones started to fall out of two of the three bands. It looks great but is not worth the price!
5,Are you kidding me???,"No one has bothered to review this yet??? This is HUGE. If you are reading this, you have an interest in heavy music...look no further. A bit on the industrial side, this two piece sounds like the plates of the earth in shift. One disc of ""best of"" material, the other rare. Track one of the rarities, ""Love is a Dog from Hell"" is worth the price alone...crushing riffs, pounding bass in sync with a drum machine...primal. There are moments of beauty to be found on here as well...the hypnotic ""Flowers"" being one of them.The ""StreetCleaner"" album is considered a classic, and rightly so...one listen to ""Like Rats"", and you'll hear why...After the earache years (which this collection encompasses), Godflesh went on to record their last album for Koch entitled ""Hymns"" as a three piece, featuring Ted Parsons (Swans, Prong) on drums...they broke up shortly thereafter. This is unfortunate, for they were onto something good..."
4,piccassoesque artsy watch,"Gave it as a gift. I like it a lot. It is bigger in person that in the photos. The movement is made in Thailand, the watch in Switzerland. All in all for the amount paid, a very nice, most unusual and lovely watch. Thanks."
1,Turning Tricks in the Studio,"At the end, the Dead Boys were imploding due to any number of issues and the vicious feuding was more reminiscent of arena rock acts.Sadly, this ""live"" album is also like the dreck issued during this era by many of the rock icons making the rounds in large venues; Stiv Bators overdubbed the vocals while sitting in a studio, with some of the musical performances sliced and diced after-the-fact.While the creation of the album is explained in the enclosed material, it does not excuse the shoddy practice. Turning tricks in the studio is deception, no matter who is working that street corner."
2,Chaotic mess...,"In the booklet that accompanies this accompanies this CD Bomp! records explains how this Cd came about. After reading about Stiv Bators not singing in the mic on purpose(only later to go back and over dub the vocals - in which he did a horrible job) and the spliced guitar parts this album is a chaotic mess. Bomp! wrote a whole lot about Stiv's performance in the booklet trying to make it sound better than it was... I'm sorry but when you're introducing Sonic Reducer as your newest song (in an unsarcastic manner mind you) in a Los Angeles studio overdub booth 3 years after the fact it comes off as pure crud. And one more thing where's ""High Tension Wire"" at?"
3,"Lovely bag, but heavy before you even put anything in it.","Amazon does not give dimensions or size information. When I received this, I thought it was lovely, but it was heavier than I want to carry, even empty. It's also not a small bag."
2,Not worth the hype:,"Despite the overall rating, don't get sucked in. I admire what Glenn has done over his illustrious career, but this album comes off sounding sophmoric at best. To be truthful, the keyboards are sub-par to match the chords. This album sounds like an ameteur tooling around with various string patterns on a low-end Yamaha keyboard. There is a theme, but it's washy and redundant. The album is short, non-direct and basically pointless. If you're looking for dark, ambient and professional non-lyrical digital work, check out Delerium.Black Aria isn't horrible; it just isn't memorable.Thumbs down."
5,Danzig at his best!,"The most orignal work from the dark one. Totally different from anything Glenn has done. A beutiful score for the fallen angel himself, Lucifer. Everyone needs this."
2,oooooookkkkk.... ugh.,"I was recently given this one and for good reason it seems. The songs aren't horrible but they have one major flaw: They don't DO anything. They all sound like the intros to songs - there is no real completion to them, no real bridge or anything... ""Intros"" is the best way I can describe them. It's not bad as mood music goes, but that's about it."
1,HAHAHA!,"Oh god. I don't know why I even bought this now.At the time that I saw this album, i was delighted,""Glenn Danzig?!Compositions!!""but..when I came home and threw it into my cd player, I was sorely disappointed.This is nothing but horribly thrown together synth-orchestration.I can see it now..Danzig hunched over a casio keyboard giggling to himself and stroking his *ahem* ego. All the while secretly congratulating himself on his so-called 'Masterpiece'avoid at all costs people. PLEASEavoid it like the plague."
4,Black Aria,Danzig himself says that many fans will find it strange that he decided to make this album and writes about this in the book-let. This sounds nothing like the music Danzig has done in the past and he shows that he is more then just a singer for a rock band. The compositions all can be said to be minimalistic and sound like a mix between delerium and instrumental synth music a la vangelis or Jarré. Danzig is not as tallented as these fellows but still has created a nice instrumental album with some nice tracks.
4,An interesting experiment,"I'm not a fan of heavy metal and so was a bit skeptical when a friend recommended this album to me (""Danzig? You know I hate heavy metal..."").When I was finally able to track it down I was glad I'd spent the time to do so. It's not ""classical"" per se (more synthesizer than much else and the repetitive themes do get trance-inducing, but maybe that was an intent...?), but it's good nonetheless. Great backdrop for rainy-night RPG sessions."
1,Can't give negative stars...,"Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star. I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought. Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser. I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.Don't buy this product if your plus size. If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing. If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did)."
3,Ab Swing Review,"The Ab Swing is easy to use but is a bit tricky to get started. As a senior citizen, I wanted something that wasn't too strenuous. This works very well and I don't realize I'm getting any exercise until after I stop, then I can tell in my lower stomach! When first starting, I had to remind myself to go very slowly."
4,i love megan kelso,"This book has some great stories and marvelous art. The stories vary in subject and tone, but the book radiates a beauty beyond words. Megan's art is simple and ""cartoony"" and, at times, awe-inspiring. If you only read one comic this month read 'Hicksville'. But if you read two make sure the other one is 'Queen of the Black Black'."
3,Good but have read better,"For a mother with a child who has seizures I purchased this book after purchasing another one, although it is informational it has too many references to get by and not very reader friendly. Recommend, Maybe."
5,EXCELLENT REMIXES!!,"Excellent remixesm but there's one song they left out.CD2, track #4, Shannon - Give Me Tonight (Victor Calderone Remix), instead it's Shannon's - Let The Music Play (Full Intention Club Mix).""This is the reason, why I got this CD, & to find out this song is not included...aahh!!This Compilationm still deserves 5 STARS, for the other trax."
5,"excellent remixes, but.........","Excellent remixes, but there is one song they left out.CD2, track #4 Shannon - Give Me Tonight (Victor Calderone Remix), instead the label put Shannon's - Let The Music Play(Full Intention Club Mix), which is already on CD1 (track #6). This is one of the reason's why I bought this CD. - & to find out this song is not included....aahh!!. This comp. still deserves 5 STARS, for the other tracks."
4,Dance your shorts off!,"I enjoyed this CD. Why do i have to write 14 words , if all i have to say is that i liked the product?"
3,Cute But Not as Pictured,"I bought this item because I'm a bit of a koala fan, as are my three young nephews. I was sure we could all have fun with this very sweet headband.When it arrived, I was pleased with the headband's color and apparent durability. However, the actual size of the koala ears is nearly just *half* of what is pictured. The headband's ears look like small, white tufts -- not like the prominent ears shown in the picture. Even after some combing, I can't get the ears to resemble the picture. There's just not enough fur.Perhaps the koala headband will still delight my youngest nephew (age 5). However, I'm pretty sure the older ones (7 and 9) will tell me right away that these ears only vaguely resemble the very prominent and endearing ears of the koala."
5,On the Kumon North America required reading list...,"This book is on the Kumon required reading list. Wonderful illustrations, amusing, and easy to read. You and your child will laugh."
4,great artwork,"This book has amazing artwork and a fun story, and not for toddlers who have no patience. But I had it when I ran a daycare 20 years ago, and the children loved sitting there talking about the pictures, finding the cat on every page, watching the animals do odd things. Very good book. I have it for when my granddaughter gets past the hurry up and read it and where are the tabs stage."
5,A must for bedtime reading,"As a mom of three, this book is one of my all time favorite picture books to read to my children. My kids love that I have a different voice for each animal and that by asking them ""What do you do?"" they feel included in my storytelling. My oldest is now 11 and still loves to listen when I read this story to her 5 year old brother."
4,What DO you do?,"Here you are, going through your day, and you KEEP on and KEEP on being RUDELY interrupted by the wildlife! What do you do when the kangaroo demands you make your bed for him to take a nap? What do you do when an opossum starts brushing his teeth like he owns the place, squirting toothpaste all over the floor? What do you do when a tiger takes your trike and insists you push him on it?YOU THROW THEM OUT!Of course, if you can't, you might all just have to snuggle up together and go to bed. It's been a long day :)"
5,My daughter loves this book!,This book is silly and my daughter loves it. We read it every night for 2 weeks. The illistrations are great. This is a good book for animal lovers.
2,average is average is a middle part of a trilogy,"Lawhead like many writers has a good idea for a beginning and hopefully a great idea for an ending. The problem is that he doesn't have or want to say to much in the middle. So he has given us this very nice travelogue of the twelve hundreds and what it was like to travel around the mediteranean.My gosh, there were good and bad people. Some were christians and some were moslems, and if we had actually met some, a couple of good and bad jews would have been in there too. But, maybe they were all murdered in Book One.Lets hope that Book Three is an improvement, or it means that Lawhead is beginning to suffer from ""Michner Syndrome"". At the end of his great writing career, Michner had become a magnificent researcher. The problem with his books became that you were going to see everything he found in his research in his books because no one had the guts to edit him.Inshallah, this too will pass"
2,"Good Show, But Not a Full Length Movie","""Imagination Island"" is one of the better Barney outings, and I can happily recommend it. However, the new packaging and promotion is extremely misleading when it claims to be a ""full-length movie."" It's not, and it never has been. ""Imagination Island"" runs only 45 minutes, and was originally a primetime TV special on NBC. It has been available on DVD since 1999.The production values are quite good, but are the same as other Barney videos of this vintage and are not of ""feature film"" quality. All of which is to say that kids will enjoy the show, as long as neither they (nor their parents) are expecting this to be either a new production or a ""full-length movie."" And shame on HIT Entertainment for this deceitful repackaging."
5,A Barney Classic,"As the professor would say... ""enchanting""... my two year old loves it- as did my -now ten year old son when he was two..."
5,used book,"I absolutely love this book. I've had it for years, and had to buy one for a friend. It arrived very quickly, and was packaged perfectly. The condition is very good, better than my copy. Thank you!"
4,MXR M103 Blue Box Fuzz/Octave Pedal,"well made. when you roll the right knob all the way to 5 o'clock you get a fuzz sound .. roll it to 7 o'clock you get a octave, everything between both is a mix of fuzz & octave.. the left knob controls the output volume. it also mixes the fuzz octave sound , it also changes very fast i mean one second fuzz and the other oct .. that fast.. from oct to fuzz you can hear it way on the back but it's there.. its hard to describe but if you're reading about it maybe its for you. the only thing i dont like is that if im playing the clean channel and then activate the blue box with the volume set a maximun, the sound coming out is lower than that when playing clean .. therefore youre gonna sound lower when you turn it on.. to solve that i use a compressor but i'd still have to press one first and then the other in order to get the same amount of volume as playing the clean channel alone."
4,Useful once you learn its quirks,"There's a slight volume drop when you activate the pedal. While there are mods out there to reconcile this (the C11 mod), they don't work on the newer Blue Box models (any model with a red PCB). To compensate for the drop, I placed the Blue Box before my clean boost pedal (an MXR Micro Amp, which is always on). Now the volume is spot-on, and can even make my overall signal louder.The octave setting (mix knob at 0) sounds quite good, but the tracking is a bit off. Use the neck pickup and play above the 12th fret for better tracking. The fuzz setting (mix knob at 100) sound great too. This is how I use the pedal. So far, I'm not too fond of the settings in between, but they are definitely usable in certain situations."
5,Great Florida Folk Music,"This is a really fun CD for children. Anyone from Florida (or the South) will enjoy the familiar themes and catchy tunes(Hot Boiled Peanuts, Florida Rain, Honeysuckle). A great gift for Florida children or those that have had a vacation to the ""real"" Florida. You can order all her CD's from www.mrskate.com"
2,It's good for now.....,"The gaurd is good for now. Eventually the teeth will chip off being that at times the gaurd rubs on the clipper blade. when the gaurd breaks, I will purchase the metal gaurd that i saw on line."
4,"Raw, gritty fusion - 4 1/2 stars","John Mclaughlin's closest brush with straight ahead hard rock. This features fellow 'Lifetimer' Larry Young on Organ and Hendrix's Band of Gypsies as the rhythm section.The sound is influenced by Hendrix, with the use of heavy distortion and wah wah processing. Mclaughlin and Young's interplay is superb throughout. This is not for persons looking for melody - with atonal harmonies and angular jams. Producer Alan Douglas deliberately makes the sound gritty to veer it closer to rock.An interesting and important document from the early days of fusion."
