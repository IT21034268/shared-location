2,A bit of disappointment,"The tracks are hardly distinguishable, same style, same melodies. After two or three tracks it is becomeing boring...forgettable. Whilst Morrison is one of my favorite singers, this album is not - put it mildly - his best"
5,Van the Man,"Van Morrison is a poet. Sometimes a bit of a clumsy one , but always the art is there. I don't have any doubts or regrets about purchasing this music and supporting this artist. ""Crazy Love"" is worth the price of admission in itself."
5,moondance,This album is like a greatest hits album in its self. Instead of buying that messed up greatest hits album van released a couple of years ago buy this. you will be listening to this for the rest of your life. Its great.
2,Strangely uncompelling,"There are inevitably comparisons between this and the ""Claudius"" novels. They are only justified in subject matter, not quality. Whereas Graves' prose was mannered and interesting, Massie's is, well, clunky. He fails to convince the reader that Augustus himself actually wrote the book. If you're looking for something to read after ""Claudius the God,"" try ""Memoirs of Hadrian,"" or at least get this from your local library first. (Some editions are entitled: ""Let the Emperor Speak: A Novel of Caesar Augustus)"
1,Not a good book,"I have the Cosmic Tarot Deck, which is why I purchased this book - to gain insight into the images in the deck. However, this book is lacking in everything one needs to determine the meanings of the cards or the images particular to this deck. I can't figure out why on earth this book is so expensive. If it's not lined in gold, there's just no reason to spend this kind of money on this overly simplistic paperback. I gave mine away to a thrift store because it was useless to me. Unless the seller of this book can give a good reason for charging $650, don't spend that kind of money for this book. For that price, you should get a lifetime of psychic readings to go along with the purchase."
5,Suitable for the more modern among us,"Would your idea of good fortune encompass things like a full voicemail box, or ending up as a dentist who actually pays off those student loans? A Waite-type deck, only even easier to interpret, with lots of additional material from a talented counselor. The descriptions of card combinations can launch you past fortunetelling by rote into new territory ..."
1,STAY AWAY!!,"Don't expect this to sound like ELP. It doesn't. This is by far the worse ELP CD ever. It's ELP in name only. Even though I tried several times, I could never even listen through the whole thing. I sold my copy and I am a big time fan of ELP. Really a waste. STAY AWAY!!"
1,Very disappointing adapter,"I researched a couple of wireless devices prior to purchasing the Linksys router and adapter. I figured, ""Both from the same company. This should be no problem."" This adapter is terrible. Dropped connection, poor signal, freezes the USB port. I read several forums and followed the suggestions. I called Linksys tech support. That call turned out to be the longest 2 hours of my life. I downloaded the most recent drivers for the adapter and for my USB. Nothing seemed to help. The last straw was when the adapter lost my control panel. Don't ask me how, but it did. I disconnected the adaptor for the last time and did a system restore. I wired my network then returned this little headache. Problem solved. By the way, all the paperwork recommends this device for Windows Vista."
5,Great range and speed,"My D-Link wireless-n router (3 antennas) is in the basement and on the other corner of our sprawling house from our office, maybe 60 feet and one floor away, with heating & AC ducting between. The Linksys adapter has no trouble communicating at around 50% signal strength & 108Mbps to 216Mbps speed, while the D-Link wireless adapter on my wife's computer in the same room often limps along at 5-10Mbps & sometimes loses connection entirely.I think part of the Linksys advantage is due to its 2 little exterior adjustable antennas which allow you to tune reception for a specific direction, while the D-Link relies on an internal antenna.Install was straightforward & easy on my dual-boot box (Win2K & WinXP) and works great with both operating systems. It was a little spendy compared to the D-Link adapter, but well worth it in terms of better overall functionality. Would definitely purchase again."
2,Works OK Until...,"This unit is great when all you're doing is browsing the web. Haven't had any issues with that. But when you start downloading a large file, or gaming it cuts out intermittently. The only way to fix is unplug it and replug it in. As other reviewers stated Linksys hasn't given a driver update since 12/04/2007, so obviously Cisco thinks its perfect despite this terrible flaw."
3,Poor Indoor Range,"Others have reviewed this product for speed and reliability and it does seem like a good choice but I bought this product for 1 main purpose which is to be able to connect over a wider range... 54Mbps (for wireless-G) is not bad at all if you compare it to 2-base-T or 10-base-T networks or the early wireless technology of 2 Mbps.Unfortunately, the indoor range for this adaptor is not at all four times as much as for wireless-G. It's barely 10% better! Plus, the Linksys driver/utility is too simple yet not intuitive! I didn't get the ""profiles"" idea and I would definitely like to see a noise indicator as well as a graph that records network signal power, quality and noise.What I read in other reviews like not having to unplug/replug and its amazing speed are true. And the manufacturing quality is good as well.Although I'm not using this adapter because it doesn't cover the range I need it to cover, I didn't return it back to Amazon because I think it's worth keeping"
1,Did not work for me!,"This may have been a problem with my PC or Compatability with Vista, but the device never stayed connected to internet. I have returned the device, and had the local telecom carrier install a dedicated line."
3,Great once you get the driver,"64-bit Windows users beware, Linksys does not have compatible drivers published, and neither does anyone else. However, if you have another internet connection established, and then install the WUSB300N, it will find alternate drivers via Windows Update! Also, this driver has issues with coming back from standby."
2,Still won't work well with Vista,"Got this device for Christmas along with a new N router from LinkSys. I experienced hangs and drops in the network connection repeatedly on my HP Vista machine. Linksys Community Forums are full of complaints about this, and while the Linksys Vista download site lists a Vista driver, the link is defective and downloads the driver for a different product. Linksys support hasn't been able to resolve the issue with multiple contacts."
1,Unreliable,"I have five computers in the house. I recently got a Linksys N router to increase range and bandwidth. In general, I love the range and bandwidth benefits, however, with this particular adapter, I have to re-boot the computer daily. I purchased a 600N and replaced this on my XP computer. I have not had to reboot the computer at all since the replacement. I moved the adapter to a Vista Computer and I have had bluescreens every few days. I need to reboot frequently to re-establish connectivity."
1,WUSB300N - is N for nightmare,Have wasted an entire day trying to get this to work. Linksys technical support is terrible. No solutions. Seems like there are a lot of reported problems with this product. Thought it would be great to have N network but my Netgear g wireless network never caused a problem and was super easy set-up. Linksys is a nightmare.
2,Not what you would expect,I purchased this product thinking that the newer Wireless-N technology would allow me to have better wireless access to my upstairs computer. Such is not the case. The wireless signal still has issues with distance and wall interference.I have better luck with my Linksys Wireless G network adapter. I suggest saving money and buy the G adapter or wait until more advanced technology is developed.
2,"good, when it works","The Good - Extension cord comes with it so you can position device for best reception possible. Ive seen pretty high transfer speeds.the bad - overheats/overloads quite easily. If you run a torrent program for instance and get too many connections.. it just overloads and loses connection. I find myself unplugging the device and replugging it in to have it re-detect the wireless signal quite often....even just regular web browsing. This happens on xp,vista and win 7 and connecting to a linksys router. I do keep my pc on 24/7 so that may have something to do with it.Id think maybe I just got a bad device but to be honest.. every linksys product Ive owned seems to have problems,, be it a laptop card or whatever.. Its really quite aggravating actually. I think this might be my last linksys product I buy."
1,Caution - WUSB300N is not stable under Windows Vista,"Could not get device from dropping link. The only solution was to unplug and replug the USB cable into the PC. Tried all drivers from Linksys, Windows Vista, and 3rd party. Called Linksys support and got nowhere. All they offered was to uninstall and reinstall their driver off their web site."
2,"Worked for internet, drops too much to play games","I bought this piece of equipment so I could play Starcraft 2 on the Computer in my room which didn't have internet. It worked fine for internet use, but it just isn't sufficient for gaming use. It actually has nothing to do with how fast the connection is. It is a fast connection. However about 1 in 10 games I get dropped from. That is annoying enough that I have no choice but to bring in a 30 foot Cable and hardwire the computer."
2,NOT COMPATABLE WITH WINDOWS 7!,"This adapter worked ok for XP. It was pretty finicky but it worked ok when it worked. However, I came here to let everyone know that this adapter is NOT SUPPORTED BY WINDOWS 7 and probably wont be in the near future. So if you are thinking of purchasing this and you just upgraded to win7 or are thinking to upgrade and you already own it. You will either need to wait for a driver(who knows how long that will take since its not out already) or buy something else.Cheers!"
2,Super Fast (for the 1/2 hour it works before stalling),"I bought this over a week ago and it has been nothing but trouble. The connection frequently gets dropped requiring the user to reset the card and/or reset the router. I also have the Linksys-N router so it's not an issue of incompatable products. The included ""monitoring"" software is of no help because it reports the connection is active and strong when there is no connection!I thought Cisco was a good brand, but this new draft N technology is obviously too new and has not been tested enough.I'm hoping Linksys comes out with driver and firmware updates to improve the connection.Last, while writing this review the connection dropped, requiring a ""repair"" It's like returning to the days of dial up modems hoping the connection will work."
3,Wanted more.,"I read Flowers for Algernon, again, for the third time and some how found this book while randomly searching on the net.I was excited to hear D. Keyes answer ""What if."" I went through this book with a vigor that didn't allow me to put it down. D. Keyes answered ""What if""... but it wasn't to the question I hoped for. He specifically states that he doesn't answer questions about the book, because it takes away from it. I believe that this is true but I just hoped he'd delve. He didn't.If you are looking for a true story on the struggle of evolving and amazing idea then please read. If you're looking for the answers to all your ""Algeron/Charlie"" questions use your imagination. :)"
5,Good read.,"Really good book. I totally recommend it, plus any other of her books. I haven't been disappointed yet."
1,POOR VIDEO,For the price and 30 minutes this video is not worth it. I like Tim McGraw but this was like watching TNN. It shows only clips of his videos.
4,Church of the New Testament,"This book is an excellent reference tool for church ministries that are trying to change the paradym of their operations from a traditional doctrinal church to a church that is transitioning into the apostolic move of God. All of the references are scriptural and the examples of how ministry leadership offices, ordinations, consecrations and selection of leadership are clear and understandable.Dr. Ramona JosephCharlotte, NC"
4,Excellent Reference,Church in the New Testament is an excellent reference book loaded with sound references for the Church of Jesus Christ.
2,Does not hold up!,"I love the design and colors which look so much better in person much more vibrant. I love the size it's perfect for soups, stews, chips, ice cream. After repeated use the glaze cracked and chipped after using it in the microwave and hand washing it after use. The ceramic started to flake and chip I have several Soup/Cereal Bowl by Pfaltzgraff but this one I guess it is the design has an issue this is the first time I have had this happen to any dinnerware I own. Maybe it was the type of design or how it was fired. There is not enough of a glace it's thin and cracks then the rim chips. I love to bowl but it just does not hold up over time."
2,"Pretty, but not durable.",Pfaltzgraff Sedona items are too fragile for normal household use. The slightest tap of a metal spoon on the edge of a plate or bowl results in big broken chips. I've used Pfaltzgraff dinnerware for 30 years and have never used a pattern that is as fragile as Sedona. A huge disappointment.
1,Don't waste your money,"I have a few brown spots on the bottom of my le creuset. I have never been able to get them off. I thought this product would be the magic formula, but it wasn't. If you're thinking about purchasing a le creuset you might think about purchasing the cleaner too to catch any stains as they happen, but once they're set nothing will take them out - not even this cleaner."
2,Le Creuset Enameled Cast Iron Cleaner,"This product did not remove month old stain on my Le Creuset Dutch oven. Also, it did not bring back shine to the enamel. It recommends wearing rubber gloves while using this product. The label does not specify that this product is biodegradable. Le Crueset recommends removing stains from enamel by boiling 1 part Tide or Gain and 3 parts water for 10 minutes in the enameled container. Let cool and wash with dish wash soap. Dry the container and then rub with white vinegar to renew shine."
2,Not worth the money,"My reason for purchase was to see if this would get red of mild stains caused by pot roasts, cassoulets and other preparations involving red wine. I have always washed the dutch ovens by hand, with hot water and mild soap -- never in the dishwasher. The enamel, especially at the bottom, had became a tad browner every time I put it in the oven. I wondered if I could have the pale-cream surface back, and bought this.Sadly, I have had no success at all with this solution. I don't think that using this cleaner from the get-go would have been brilliant, because it made absolutely no difference to the stains. Maybe Le Creuset enamel gets colored from red wine tannins and they don't advertise it?"
4,IMPROVED APPEARANCE OF PAN,"Pan incredibly marred by user so it will take a few more treatments to bring it back to the original, flawless, appearance."
1,What a waste!,The product didn't seem to make any difference. I should have listened to the negative reviews.
2,Not As Advertised,I tried this on a brand new lodge cast iron casserole. It had just regular stains on it after one use and after using this cleaner the stains were still there. I've used it since and still no good results.
1,Product does not work,so save your money and use Bon Ami cleanser instead. I purchased two of these in the outlet store for about $20 and now I wish that I had saved my money.
1,Cleaner is no better than soap and water,"I have had Creuset pots for years and love them. My big Dutch oven got some discoloration and I purchased this cleaner hoping it would get rid of the spots, but after fifteen minutes of intense scrubbing, my arm was falling off and there no significant progress. Back to soap and water. Waste of money."
3,Try Mr Clean Magic Eraser,"I was annoyed my Le Cruset was getting stained so tried everything to clean the spots off and NOTHING worked. As a last ditch effort, I tried Mr Clean Magic Erased and it worked! I have no idea why or how but the stuff works. Doesn't scratch and for stubborn stains, you really have to scrub hard but stain will come off. Trust me.try it out and good luck!"
4,Works well on my new le creuset skillet,"I bought this when I got my new skillet grill and have been using it to wipe away stains and burn marks on the enameled surface after cooking. It does a great job of removing fresh stains without scratching the surface. I'd definitely recommend this for le creuset cookware to keep it looking brand new. Judging from other reviews, i think it will be useful only on fresh stains."
1,worthless,This was absolutely worthless. Bartender's Friend worked better at 1/5 the price. I should have believed all the earlier reviews.
4,"Removed much of the stain, but not all.","We've used our Le Creuset french oven for just over one year.The oven has acquired some light brown stains.We tried Bar Keepers Friend, Cameo and Comet, they haven't helped.I was really looking forward to this Le Creuset product being the cure.The bottle claims this is a unique formula,specially designed for cleaning enameled cast iron cookware.Cleans fast, removes most stains.I have mixed feeling about this product.I shook the bottle, used an ample amount, rubbed and rubbed.Much of the stain did come off, all the part that looked 'brownish' was removed.However, some light 'grayish' stain still remains.This cleaner did remove much that others wouldn't.However, I was expecting it would remove all the stain.So I am some disappointed, and yet glad for what it did that other cleaners didn't."
5,Very Happy With Results,I had purchased a used dutch oven pan. It had some brown spots on the bottom. Got this product and it took out all the spots! Now after I use the pan a few times those searing brown spots may show up now and again. I just put a few drops in the pan and scrub lightly and it looks brand new again. Very pleased with product.
5,Larger than I thought,"It fits on my frame well and is slim enough that my legs don't knock against it. The bag is built sturdily and stores quite a bit of stuff actually, more space than I need for my tools, pump, wallet, keys, and pistol. Tabs on the zippers let it be opened quickly and it opens both forward and backward with dual zippers on each side."
4,Convenient storage on the go,"When I got this pack, I didn't realize how big it would be. It can store a lot! It has dual compartments on either side with dual zippers to open/close in both directions. The construction seems tough and rugged. Because it was so big, it didn't fit the way it was intended. I turned it around so narrow end is toward the bike's neck and used both straps that would normally go around the down tube to wrap the seat tube and a bike lock. To clarify, the top strap went around the seat tube while the lower strap goes around the base of the u-bolt style lock. The lock is secured to my top tube by a mount, but there was a time when it fell out of the mount. Luckily, the strap held onto it until I could remount it properly. If you got a Diamondback Insight 2 small, medium, or large, then you'll probably have to do the same as I did because the frame has a narrower space than usual between the top and down tubes where they meet at the neck."
2,some design flaws,"The zippers don't rattle and the cordura is quite heavy-duty, but they inexplicably used a continuous piece of cloth for the top strap. This happens to collide with the lugs for my brake cable, so I can't even mount it on my bike. If they had used several smaller straps, it would not matter if one or two collide with a lug. Also, it is divided into a smaller side pocket and a main pocket. I find this ridiculous in a bag this small (cuts down on the usable space), but some people may enjoy that feature."
1,"What a disappointment, DO NOT BUY!","I was so disappointed in this book! I bought it to read to my son on his first night in the ""big boy bed."" I'm sure glad I read it over myself first! It says things like ""I can bounce high on my bog boy bed."" and ""Mom and Dad tuck me in, but I can get out again anytime I want."" Jumping on the bed and getting out anytime he wants are not things a child sleeping in a big bed for the first time needs to hear about! Doesn't this author have children??? Please don't waste your money on this book, it will fill your child's head with all kinds of things that will just end up getting him in trouble!"
1,Terrible book,I agree with the last reviewer. This is a completely inappropriate book for a toddler. Jumping on the bed? Getting out of the bed at night whenever I want? What kind of idiot writes this? I only wish I had read the reviews before I bought it.
2,Just Okay,"Two things I did not love about this book - it talks about jumping on the big boy bed (something I would assume most parents - myself included - do NOT want their kids encouraged to do) AND it talks about getting out of the big boy bed and going to disturb baby sister in her crib down the hall - not sure I like that idea either, but other than that, it's a cute story about getting a big boy bed and leaving the crib behind."
3,The kid's like this one,"Even though this is far from an excellent book, the children like it because it is a bout a puppy.The story centers around this puppy and his first Christmas. He is kicked out of the house on Christmas Eve for ripping presents and knocking down the tree. He then goes to the barn where the animals try to figure out what Christmas is.This is obviously not a religious book as the only definition given for Christmas is the receiving of gifts."
3,Battery design a bit gimpy,"This microphone picks up sound just fine. No complaints about that.If you are using the mic without the battery supply it should be great. I need the battery supply. I have three complaints:1. The required battery is an odd type. Why not go with something standard?2. The battery holder is gimpy. Difficult to open. Awkwardly shaped, it creates an inconvenient package in the middle of the mic line. Where do you put this when the mic is on your lapel? I don't know. The design is not helpful. It would be better to just have a bigger mic with the battery inside it and leave out the separate battery holder.3. Battery switch is confusing. I'm getting used to it, but when you switch it on the battery indicator doesn't stay on, so you can't tell by looking if it's on or not. Makes it difficult to remember to turn it on or off, which is almost a deal breaker for someone like me."
4,Clip-on Microphone,"I use two Sony ECM-C115 omnidirectional Clip=on for amature, hobby film making. These are great for inexpensive microphones;however, I have invested in a more expensive, heavy duty microphone and a sound mixer for better quality as I am now getting PAID for filming workshops and lectures. But small sony is great for family recordings."
3,Politics as usual,"Griffin at his best, but I expected the characters and the plot would be more in line with the title"
2,Not a fan,"I agree with the earlier opinion that this series is like a long drawn-out soap opera. Especially evident in ""Counter Attack"" - I was just waiting for the book to end. I'm done with Griffin."
2,"Confusing, convoluted, not one of his better books...","Griffin's books normally run in a chronological order, with frequent and sometimes confusing flashbacks. Yes this book goes back and starts chronologically somewhere in the middle of book one of The Corps and revisits people and places we've already seen and been to. This book also throws names at you, LOTS and lots of new characters and places, people who didn't exist in the first two books and yet appear in the time frame those two books take place in. If you put finished the 2nd book in the series and expected this to pick up where that left off with the characters you were reading about and interested in, you'll be sadly disappointed as most of the people we've already met have only supporting roles in this novel."
2,Typical Cheap Chinese Product,"The review stating that this is the only model NOT made in China has been deleted, though that was my main reason for buying it. The sound is OK. The design is the problem. The battery compartment is located in the most inconvenient place and you need a tool to pry out the batteries (which it uses up too fast). There is no external power option at all. The controls are tiny and marked white on white. I will not be buying any more Panasonic products."
4,CD Player,I read the reviews saying the buttons were too small. And yes they are too small. I have to pick up the player while I'm on the treadmill and hold it close so I can see which button I'm supposed to push. Other than that it's great. The headphones are comfortable and it was priced right.
4,"Panasonic SL-SX480W Portable CD Player, White","I use this CD Player mostly for listening to book on CD. It has a very useful feature that it would remember where to continue when it is turned off and on again. Furthermore, the 2 AA batteries can last a long time with this player. The only thing I don't like is that the buttons are too small."
3,"Good player, free shipping","I use this for books on tape and the feature that remembers where you left off is the reason I bought it. The small buttons are a problem, but I got used to the feel of them. The earphones are very WHITE, clunky, and not very comfy and look old fashioned, so I bought others. Has a good volume level and doesn't skip. I always have good luck with Panasonic products. I hope they keep the quality up. Love the free super-saver shipping-things show up FAST, even though they say it will take 3 to 5 days extra. I usually get things in 3 or 4 days. Zoom."
2,did not last long,It did not last more than a few months before it broke. It was never dropped either.
4,Early Prog Rock Classic,"A great early British progressive rock album. Mellotron and keyboard lovers will delight in this one! STRONGLY recommended to all fans of old KING CRIMSON and THE MOODY BLUES. ""Introduction"" has got to be one of the coolest ""Jesus rock"" songs ever written!!! (In fact Paul (Sandy)Davis later sang on the Jesus Christ Superstar album). From there, we move on to the classically tinged art rock of ""Heaven"" (with great atmospheric mellotron and guitar) which asks us: ""Do you have a clean mind?"" and ""Hell"" (with much King Crimsonish chaos). The closing tracks are full of classical music and mind-bending elements and pomp. If prog rock's what floats your boat, Gracious are one of the finest examples from the early 70's. A much overlooked band."
3,Thankful?,"Not without signs of promise, the classically influenced psychedelic rock is quite hit-and-miss, with creative compositional technique and some subtly excellent transitioning work beating out what can devolve into garish medley and arranged awkwardness."
4,Windows XP Home Edition: The Missing Manual,It is clear. Full of numerous illustrative tables and figures.Covering every aspect of the widows XP. I recommend it for the average computer user.
5,book,This book was exactly what I wanted. It is a gift for my father who is 87 years old and wanted a manual for his computer. Received it very quickly too.
3,Still Missing,The first 5 operations I tried to find were missing. The info may be in there but I could not find them by the index or other methods.
2,David Poque's advice will cost you $100,"Mr Poque says that you can not do a ""clean install"" with the Windows XP upgrade. He says that the only way to do a ""clean install"" (the only way to go to avoid trouble) is to purchase the full version of Win XP. This is false. Win XP upgrade works just like all other Win upgrades. When you do a ""clean install"" it will ask you to insert the disk from your previous version and then install WinXP. Buy the upgrade and save your money. There are many other errors, but this is the one that will cost you money.Female readers will be upset with the fact that he always refers to the ""administrator"" as a male and the ""subordinate"" as a female."
5,"Beautiful, inspiring; a joy to page through","This is for those who aren't into cute, cartoony looking scrapbooks. I have never really gotten into scrapbooking before, because the examples I've seen just aren't my style. This book has changed my attitude 180 degrees. If you love beautiful, elegant artwork, this book will inspire you. Anyone familiar with the magazine Somerset Studio will feel right at home. Your memory albums don't have to be childish or tacky...buy this book!"
5,I'm so glad I bought this book,"Even if I never did any of the beautiful art work described and shown in these pages,I'd still be happy to own this book. The author goes beyond the mundane, childish and in my opinion, artless arrays of photos mounted on various colored papers that I've seen in several other how-to scrapbook books. Each of the scrapbook pages and covers she describes and shows are truly works of art that might even be good enough to display in a museum one day. She describes how to use various media (watercolors, textured and handmade papers, decoupage, etc.) to make a memory book a veritable art collection. There is quite a bit of information on handling antique photos. In fact, many of her backgrounds seem geared towards old photos, although the techniques covered are also suitable for modern ones. The clip art at the end is pretty helpful. Definitely a very inspirational volume and well worth the price!"
4,Barbirolli or Baudo?,"Just for the record: John Barbirolli does NOT conduct the Messiaen here. Moreover, Glorious John only 'does' both Debussy pieces from CD 1. The 'rest' is Serge Baudo. It is true however, that in all cases it's the Orchestre de Paris that's being conducted. Hardcore Barbirolli aficionadi should know about this, since it is not at all clear from the CD info here, nor elsewhere.And in all cases it's a fine and impressive recording."
2,Good writer but bad story teller.,This book was extremely boring. I forced myself to read the first half of the book and had to stop. If I have to force myself to read something then its not worth reading. Munro is a good writer but the stories are depressing and boring at best. I was trying to figure out what was going on most of the time. I would finish one story and tell myself to keep going and maybe the next one would be better but they didnt get much better and I finally gave up.
2,I don't get what all the fuss is about!! Its pretty average!,"I only read the title story, Runaway. I'm not sure what all the hoopla is about surrounding this book - but i wasn't impressed at all.The characters are are neither interesting, nor memorable. You don't really get a clear sense of who they are or what makes them tick, they have no depth, no character, no personality.The storyline was equally uninspiring and uninteresting. I kept expecting something to happen or some kind of epiphany or insight but it never came and when i was done i just thought, ""huh??!!""I've enjoyed many books that don't have such distinct or interseting stories but are so beautifully written the words carry you along, and i've also enjoyed books that have a compelling story but are very simply written. This book was neither style or story driven.Whatever genre this is, i really don't like it!"
2,I had high expectations,"""National Bestseller"", ""...best fiction writer now working in North America..."", ""Best Book of the Year""? Unfortunately, I was not moved, captivated, entertained, educated or challenged by this collection of stories."
3,An inconsistent anthology,"This collection of short stories is inconsistent, but there are a few gems to be discovered. The title story was my favorite, an original, nuanced tale populated with complex characters that kicked off a lively discussion in my book club. I also liked Tricks, a story about a chance meeting between a man and a woman, and what happens when they agree to meet again one year later.Unfortunately, some of the other stories weren't quite as well crafted. At least three were well-paced until the very end, when they abruptly resolved."
5,Beautifully written short stories,"This was my first foray into the world of Alice Munro's short stories and I am hooked, as they say, line and sinker, and I couldn't be more pleased. These beautiful stories are so well written and straight forward that I couldn't break away. Admittedly, I was confused by the format of the book at first since it is a collection of short stories but the second, third and fourth chapters were a continuation of the same story. Once I realized that I was reading short stories I was amazed. They stood alone so perfectly yet fit together wonderfully. I experienced love, joy, pain and regret in these stories that I had never felt so clearly before. I will be reading more from Alice Munro in the future with no doubt."
5,Recommendation from home school mom,"I am teaching my 5th grade daughter about the Constitution (since it is in the news all the time) and can't tell you how happy I am with the series. It goes over why the ammendments were added to the Constitution as well as what they are. There were many things in there that I didn't know. They also talk about landmark decisions by the Supreme Court.A lot of the series went over my daughters head, but I would stop and explain what they just talked about. This would be great for junior high or high school as well as adults. It drives me crazy that history and government classes were so boring in school, dvd's like this one would have made it more interesting and easier to learn!! My daughter loved it and was happy we watched it, she said she learned a lot.One note, this series is in 8 parts (1/2 hour each) and is perfect for 1 part each day."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I was expecting a really engrossing video series for the money...BOY WAS I DUPED! It is terribly boring and kids can not be expected to watch more than 10-20 minutes of it. It can be used as small snipets on some issues, but on the whole, a terrible disappointment for the price."
2,Disappointing,The title and the premise seemed intriguing but it turned out to be a fairly boring book about errors and sloppy map-making.
2,Very disappointing,"My 4 year old daughter received this as her birthday gift. She ooh & ahhed when she was opening it, but it was very small on her. She really loved it & wanted to wear it, but moments after she put it on, she took it right off. It's marked for ages 3 & up, but it's more appropriate for age 3 to 3 1/2. The skirt is only knee length but the display photo of the outfit on the package does not let you see that it is only knee-length. It may be all right for a 3 year old, but at the age of 4, prepare to pass it on."
5,The Last Answering Machine you will buy!,"I purchased my ""Friday"" off ebay for a little under 100.00 dollars. The unit is heavy and packed with features. Although the unit is considered obsolote because it is no longer manufactured, I look at it as a well built unit with many features current machines do not, or can not include due to the cost factor. As another reviewer wrote it will take a few minutes to learn to program it. Once this is accomplished you will never have to do it again. I purchased my unit about ten years ago and then retired it for a much more modern unit. Unfortunately, my Pansonics, Sony, V-Tech unit all died and I have happily returned to this retro looking unit which has NEVER failed me."
1,Not very good!,This item did not meet my expectations. The call forwarding volume was very low and the answering machine did not hang up when someone choose not to leave a message. I don't recommend this!
4,Good,Seems cheap when you open it(it is plastic that is why it's lightweight) but is very sturdy. A lot better than the metal one I returned. Very pleased.
1,Used book,I was disappointed. I ordered this book new and it came obviously used with highlighter marks all through the book.Introduction to Christian Worship
4,Very Helpful,"White has written a book which, every new worship leader needs to read, and the experienced leader should keep on their shelf as a refercence. Each chapter objectively looks at the history and practice of worship and liturgy. White carefully outlines each Christian tradition and seeks his reader to understand, the practice of today's church.This book is helpful for those who may be from church traditions which have a unwritten liturgies especially."
4,Hits the mark but,"I have the Kindle version of this book so I must start with an issue with the Kindle version which is that the diagrams are impossible to look at. As they are not oriented for the Kindle. If you turn the Kindle the diagram moves so you can't view them. The book itself started slow but does cover the topic and I find the reading moved a bit faster as I read. The author is a bit ""wordy"". Overall though a good resource."
2,Boring,"The book contians standard information, is written somewhat blandly, and doesn't reveal anything the myriad other poker books have already covered.I do like the cover though.I went to the bookstore specifically for this book, but was rather dissapointed when I looked through it. So, take my review with a grain of salt, b/c I only spent approximately 20 minutes reading through the various chapters."
2,Yet Another Book On Basic Holdem Strategy,"Let me be perfectly clear: This is not a bad book on how to successfuly play holdem. I would have no problem recommending this book to anyone who is interested in LEARNING how to play.However, as a book that advertises itself as how to play and win online it is no better than anything else out there. Which is to say: it is a disappointment. 80% of the book is dedicated to the basics of holdem play and strategy. The remaining 20% offers sometimes useful insight into playing online but nothing that is particularly insightful or revolutionary.[...]Finally, don't buy this book in search of the ""secret"" to winning on the internet. It is simply not any better or different than anything else out there. It's a good BASIC book on holdem, nothing more, nothing less. [...]"
3,Fine Organization but Overpriced.,"Internet Texas Hold 'Em is one of the more meticulously put together books I've ever seen. It is strong in organization and focus. It gives chapter outlines, summaries, and test questions galore and the author indisputedly knows what he's talking about. You may recognize his name from this year's WSOP Championship where he had his Aces snapped by Al Krux on ESPN. Overall, this offering is educational even if rather dry and mechanical.I recommend this guide as I definitely learned some things, but I will say that you may be wise to buy something else first as the price is rather prohibitive. [...]"
4,Great book for beginner to low-intermeidate.,"[...]you can't go wrong with this book based on content for the beginner to low intermediate! Some of the details here basic, but if you're new to the online game -- regardless of how much experience you have in live play -- this book is worth reading even if it seems to touch only on the basics. The concepts of taking notes on other players and game selection is a very unique concept to the online game."
3,Solid Book - Great Starting Hand Chart,"I try to pick up something new from each poker book I read. As I am a new student to the game, I have found the starting hand chart found in this book to be extremely helpful. The chart lays out what hands you should play from what positions, and under what conditions (unraised/raised pot).But beyond this chart I have to agree with Bartman_9 in that internet poker is pretty much live poker without tells. There were a few pages of specific internet related material and internet tips here and there but not much at all. If you want to play serious online poker and you are somewhat of a beginner, then this book would be a good cold call, however don't expect it to impart an online silver bullet. You can't go wrong with this book, 3 stars."
4,Very good book for beginners,"I think this book is very good for hold'em players at beginner level (like me). One of the best organised one (the best I've ever read), full of good concepts on a very detailed way. I like it very much especially because of the lot of hand examples and Q&A-s.; So I think it is worth to buy, but unfortunately you won't get a lot of internet tips. If you buy this book you won't be disapponted, but if you really want a poker book about the internet play without common strategies concept don't buy this book.Good luck!!!........Luck?????? Read this book and you won't need luck anymore!!!!"
4,Very good reference,"This book is a complete reference for limit holdem. All the important poker concepts are included. It is a good book to go back to from time to time for reference. The author is not a professional writer so the book is written in, shall I say, an uninteresting style. The hand examples cover both high and low limits; however not enough analysis is devoted to how to play differently in different limits. If you are a beginner, this book will take several reading for it to make sense to you. Even then, you need some game experience to really understand it. All in all, this is a very good book and I recommend it."
3,Good information,"The book has a lot of helpful information for an aspiring poker player. Just be warned that this book is for ""limit"" hold'em and not ""no limit."""
2,Too simplistic for psychiatrists/residents,"I bought this book as a first year psychiatry resident, thinking that it would be the psychiatric equivalent to the Washington Manual. I was sorely disappointed. While the title says it is a practical guide, I felt it was practical only for diagnosis but not treatment. For a new intern who needed to know what drug to give when, how to treat this fell way short of the mark.It wasn't particularily helpful in the clinics or on rounds or in the ER. It was too vague for that.I ended up never using it. Instead in my third year I sold it brand new. I think it's probably a great book for someone who doesn't have basic mental health experience, such as a medical student, or a medicine resident etc. It's a complete waste of time for the psychiatry resident!"
2,outdated,"I am sure the book was a good book at the time of its printing , but as new version emerge the book becomes somewhat useless."
1,Theodorico and his family they were of former French origin.,"Documents of epoch that dismantle completely this book:- Theodorico he turns out to be mentioned together qith his father and mother ""Bernier and Rolinde"" for his grandmother Bertrada,forthwith of foundation of the dominion of Prum, dominion that was coming from the Ardennes up to Metz's city (721).- Theodorico he turns out to be mentioned in the ""Liber Manualis"" (843) together with his father and mother ""Bernier and Rotrude"" and others parents between the francs before lats of the dinasty Guilhemide.This book is very bad, and the author the uncultivated one."
5,"not the same as 25 years ago, but what is anymore","I remember having a similar rubbermaid product when I was a kid at my parents house. It was wonderful. Very large, and very sturdy. This one is large, but not as large as the one when I was a kid. I don't use the ""loft"" side much becuase it takes up too much space to use as a loft and the plastic is not strong enough to hold our heavy glasses. It's just my husband and I (with one year old baby) so we don't have that many dishes. For us, this is perfect. When my little one gets older, I can still see this being large enough. But for a family of 4, not so sure. It holds plates and bowls well organized and you can stack other pans, etc. above those. I agree with other users in that the caddy is too small and doesn't hook well enough. that's my only gripe about this piece. But I've been researching long enough to like that it doesn't rust and it organizes my dishes well.good buy"
5,Together,I feel that the dish drainer and a drain board should be sold together instead of seperate because most people put the dish drainer on the counter because it is so big not in the sink.
4,Does the job,I'm a little worried the cup section may break and the utensil holder is small and doesn't want to stay in place but overall I'm pleased with the product
3,Dish drainer,"I brought it for color preference to match kitchen decor. However, the little feet swivels and do not stay on, so often times, I just take them off, but then it does not really fit the drainboard that matches it. Small nusiance and I would purchase again if I had to."
3,"$12.99 is cheaper storage for extra pot lids, baking racks and cast iron bakeware","I'm not satisfied by the available products for lids and other sheet/flat items. Since my rubbermaid dish drainer has supported lids and such with no problem for more than a decade, I feel confident in ordering this product on the web.Without the side panel, I can fit in 2 cast iron cornbread pans, 2 cast aluminum mini cake pans, 1 bundt pan and 1 loaf pan. Everything is dark so it looks like one pile and less offensive atop the refrigerator. Black is wonderful.I use the removable side panel as a guard between the two cast iron pans and more fragile cast aluminum pans. The divided cup is the perfect size for measuring cups and rolled up silicone mats."
2,Good Story----Lousy Details,"This was a good story, but obviously not written by Clancy. I'm surprised he let his name get put on the cover. The details concerning the characters and some of the events destroy the whole fabric of the story. For example, most of the enlisted personnel in the story are cited as being ""Privates"". In real life, guys with those kinds of knowledge and skills would be senior NCO's. This applies to both the North and South Korean forces and the the US military. Also the team leader would not be a 25-year old Lt. Col. Maybe a 35-year old, but not 25. The author also shows his general lack of knowledge of things military by indiscriminately labeling all military forces the Army. The Army does not operate C-9A Nightengale or C-141 aircraft. The author's lack of knowledge of his characters took the edge off the whole story."
1,I love Clancy but this is 100% GARBAGE,I bought the book thinking that Tom Clancy wrote it. I like his books. I do not know if he ever even took a glance at this OP trash that bears his name on the cover. The whole OP series is trash... do not read it... very dissapointing.Ramon Bartschat
1,Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read,"What a terrible waste of paper. After about 100 pages, I kept trying to force myself to read a few more just to finish the book. At 350 pages (of the 500 page book), I quite literally said ""life is too short to waste on this garbage"" and threw the book away."
2,Very Weak Entry to the Clancy canon,"This book is very disappointing, as it never seemed the least bit believable nor compelling. The threat didn't seem threatening, the operations not convincing, and in a first for a Clancy-verse novel, was internally inconsistent. For example, on page 413 of the paperback ""..the woman put three bullets into the back of the wheelchair. The dead body fell forward."" Yet on page 426 referring to the same wheelchair (after a knife thrust to it's back,) ""..she murmured 'How did he miss?' 'I never go anywhere without my Kevlar-lining,' he said. 'Multilayered bullet-proofing in the back and seat..."" How does a body get pitched out of a chair when the bullets can't directly transfer their momentum to the body in question? It's not a big point, but an example of the sloppiness in the book, which is unusual for most of the Clancy-verse offerings. A uncharacteristically weak and unsatisfying offering."
3,Fun light read,"This was a good book with some intrigue and suspense. It starts off slow but gains momentum, and the the last 50 pages or so are fairly suspenseful. If you're looking for something fun to read that's not too heavy, this is a good book. One downside is that some of the technology that would seem so fascinating when the book was written is fairly mundane now."
3,"Corey's ""Games of State"" review","This is my second book by Tom Clancy and judging between this one and Shadow Watch, it is a much better book. The characters are a little confusing on their backgrounds and where the scene is taking place unless you look at the headings but I thought even without a very strong plot that it was still interesting. I don't normally read many books so it takes a lot for me to stay interested and I just kept reading. One of the bad parts was that a reader can almost guess what is going to happen next.The book has a small beginning, long middle, and short end. There are groups of neo-Nazi's in Germany that try to take over people throughout the world with video hate games on computers. Paul Hood and his team are in Germany buying things for Op-Center and get mixed up in the mess. That is all I can say. I don't want to spoil the end for anyone, so you will have to read it yourself."
1,Bad research?,"I started to read Games of State a few days ago and I must say that I am very disappointed. It shows that American writers sometimes feel that thorough research is not really necessary. How can you write about ""Chaos Days"" in Hanover as a neo-Nazi Event? Even if its a fictitious story, and even if you are American, there is no way that you can mistake a ""traditional"" left-wing event with a Nazi-event.There are many details about Europe and Germany in particular in that book that are flatout wrong or badly researched. Stick to the truth.Making easy money might have been the only idea behind this book."
2,Was Tom Not Able To Describe It More Realisticly?,"~I am a faithful fan of Tom Clancy, and I live in Republic Of Korea, the field of <Op Center(!)~ satelite, but that doesn't make any defference). In other words, North Korea will not agree on detente so easily, therefore senario in <Op Center"
1,Not Clancy - poor plot - wordy - childish,Not up to the usual Clancy style - concepts - or technical expertise. I wonder if Clancy really wrote this dud?
2,waste of time,If Clancy even had a part in this book I'd be surprised... incredibly unbelievable and hokey
2,Bad Stuff,"I wish Mr. Clancy had included more technical detail into his book. I feel that the book lacks more entertaining events e.g. Bill Gates drinking the tainted water. From this, Bill and his evil empire develop a program that buggers all computers in the Middle East. Next, Bill ( or if I were Mr. Clancy...) King Bill takes over the whole world and crushes the green empire of Linux. Once done, Bill kicks back in his favorite chair, kicks off his shoes, opens a cold Rolling Rock and proclaims ""I'm the K-I-N-G of the world..."" This book is so bad this storyline, in comparison, is actually good..."
1,"Oh, come on!!!","During this book, I found my self saying ""Oh, Come On!!"" over and over. That pretty much sums up the whole book. From a video game supposedly causing the destruction of the free world, to a young lady bothering to go to a Neo-Nazi camp simply to yell ""Screw You!"" to a man in a wheel chair beating the heck out of a group of Nazi musclemen with only a broomstick handle and a knife.I don't know why I even bothered to finish this nonsense."
2,Op-center does it again.,This was the third op-center bbok I read and they all seem the same. Someone is trying to overthrow a government or stage some type of a coup and it`s op-center`s job to stop them. I think any of the op-center books would be a dissapointment to someone who is expecting the quiality of the Jack Ryan series.
1,Worst Clancy book by far...,"This novel was an obsolete combination of stereotypes and badly researched facts. The story has definitely nothing to do with the situation in Germany. Usually I enjoy Clancy's books because of their acurate background research. But after this it makes me wonder how ""acurate"" the other novels really are... Stay away from this one!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED TOM?,IF CLANCY ACTUALLY WROTE THESE THEN HE HAS FALLEN FAR FROM THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER AND DEBT OF HONOR. ALL THE OP-CENTER BOOKS ARE TERRIBLE. THEY DEPART SO FAR FROM CLANCY'S USUALLY EXCELLENT WRITING STYLE. MR. CLANCY NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL WHAT HE PUTS HIS NAME ON. I HAVE READ ALL THE OP-CENTER BOOKS ONLY BECAUSE HIS NAME WAS ON THEM AND ALL THROUGH THEM I WAS WONDERING WHEN HE WAS GOING TO START WITH ACTUAL WRITING INSTEAD OF USELESS DRIBBLE. IF YOU ARE A CLANCY FAN STAY CLEAR OF THE OP-CENTER BOOKS AND STICK TO HIS BOOKS ON RYAN.
2,Disappointing,Very poor and not like Clancy at all. Not recommended for Clancy fans - it is only an average read in any case
2,Op-Center? More like Dead-Center.,"In reading the Op-Center books out of order, I was glad I was.Op-Center: Mirror Image was good. Not great, not enthralling,just good. Op-Center was weak. In fact, I did not even finishit!Skip this book and go on to Op-Center:Mirror Image."
1,It stinks!,"If you're looking for the typical Tom Clancy ""keep you on the edgeof your seat"" book, stay away from this one. It's not written by him,only his name is on it as developed by.Save your money and buy a Larry Bond novel!"
3,Filled with suspense but not without faults.,Fast paced and a typical Clancy. A little too heroic in my opinion. Fun to read. Not very convincing when dealing with computer viruses.
1,Flop-Center,"~I wonder how much of this book Clancy actually wrote. Is he just trying to make money? The plot drags on predictably and the cheesy a la ST:TNG sub-plots don Clancy is capable of. Clancy(?) usually writes much better than he does in this book and I feel embarrassed to call myself a Clancy fan after reading it. Bottom line: Stick to real Clancy novels. P.S.: Amazon, you should give reviewers the option of choosing zero stars."
2,"Touching, but not what I expect","Let's face it: its a touching story but this won;t impress people who are reading this for military/political thrillers!!! Anyway, the strikers cant survive an ""unleaded"" tomahawk blast even if it is aborted."
2,Lacked punch expected from Tom Clancy,The beating heart of America's defence didn't beat that much in this Tom Clancy. The beginning was exciting and promised a lot but it fell away considerably towards the end. The plot for mine was too thick and enough time was not taken to explain who the characters were.
4,A typical Clancy book. Lots of names and lots of action.,"It always takes me a while to get all the names stright whenI read a Clancy book, and this one is no different. I foundmyself going back and forth a few times trying to figure outwho a particular statement referred to. Around a third of the way throughthe book, I was able to really absorb the story and follow what washappening without distraction about who was who.The action builds well, and is believable. The charactersare well defined, which is absolutely necessary since thereare so many of them. I enjoyed the book more and more as I gotfarther into it. I finished the last third in one sitting.One thing which disappointed me was the introduction of astoundinglypowerful technology which ended up being nothing more than aplot device to get people to be in the right place at theright time."
1,Why so much hatred?,"I used to be a Tom Clancy fan. I read nearly all his books prior to ""Games of State"". I particularly liked ""Patriot Games"" for example, that I read 3 or 4 times. I said ""used to be"", for it is difficult to be a Frenchman and remain a Tom Clancy fan after reading ""Games of State"". Apart from the fact that, to add some local color, he makes a grotesque mess of the french language,(but this would not be that important for english-speaking readers) he has all the characters , the ""good ones"" as well as the ""bad ones"", express such hatred and contempt for France, its people and its institutions, that I couldn't help thinking it was the author's own view that was being expressed. So I am just wondering: what did we ever do to Mr Clancy to deserve such punishment?"
4,Capitvating and holds one's attention,"Good insight into the operation of our government. Interesting storyline, well-paced."
1,This was terrible!!,"I have read many of Clancy's books....enough to know that this isn't one of them! While reading it ,I could pick out the parts that Clancy MIGHT have hadd a hand in writing. Those are mainly the parts dealing with technology. The book reads like a poor James Bond script. Are we to believe that a video game is going to cause world turmoil? You could say that I've read this book (or any in the Op-center series) twice. The first time and the last time."
1,About as enjoyable as a bad TV Movie-of-the Week.,"As a die-hard fan of Clancy since before Red October was popular, I couldn't get over my disappointment at what was clearly a sell-out by Clancy. The plot was weak, the characters one-dimensional, and the '90's politically correct overtones were too much to take. Where is John Clark when you need him?"
1,From bad to worse...,"The Jack Ryan novels are usually good (if sometimes a bit one-dimensional...), but the ""OP center"" books are simply bad. The plots are thin, the dialog laughable and the characters uninteresting. ""Red Storm Rising"" shows how good TC can be at his best. Stick to that formular Tom!"
4,Knowledgable - Well Written Drama,"Negatives: Would have rather the enemy not been the easy Nazi target, just because it is too predictable to use any more in my opinion, butPositives: This was very well written. The way it flowed it really made me want to continue on. Use of gadgetry was studied, believable and just interesting. Recommended."
4,Have found a spelling error,"I have enjoyed Tom Clancy's books from Rainbow Six, The Sum of All Fears and now am reading the Op-Center Mirror Image. I was alarmed to find a typo. On page 254, towards the middle bottom of page, Orlov asekd. Should be asked, but of course I don't speak Russian."
3,Good Clancy Yarn!,"Good plot! Typical Clancy. I liked the indepth look at the characters, especially the way he portrayed Paul Hood's first love paranoia over Nancy. There were some parts that I just didn't know the meaning for them being there. Like the part where the FBI raided the New York house, what was the point of that, why was it there? And a guy in a wheelchair with a terrified girl, fighting an army of neo-Nazis. Come on!"
2,Hmm... Probably the worst Clancy book yet.,"Clancy's new Op-Centre novel ""Acts of War"" is notanywhere near his preceeding works.The misinformed rhetorical questions and prejudicial dialogs hecreated are outright awful. The book lacks the most basic knowledge of geography, language, culture and economics of the region that the plot takes place. Believe me, I know... because I live there. It was like reading a fantasy novel. Maybe his co-author was responsible for the research? In any case, a big disappointment for Clancy fans. :-("
3,What can you expect from a colaboration?,"This book can been seen as entertaining at best- but if you are a true Clany fan, prepare to be disappointed. There is none of the normal breathtaking player movements that are usually present in other Clancy novels. In the back of your mind, you always think ""Yeah, right, it could happen, sure."" You can definitely tell from reading that there is someone else besides Clancy involved in the writing of this book"
4,It was tolerable.,"First off, the only reason I picked up Op-Center was because it was created by Tom Clancy and ""the other guy"", and as a (at least I think I am) deicated Clancy fan, I feel a sense of duty to read anything written or created by him. And no it wasn't actually written by Tom, instead it was written by some guy named Jeff Rovin. That explains a LOT of the, er, unusual things in the text. Errors that Tom would NEVER have let by in one of his ""real"" books like at one point an F-117A Nighthawk takes off from an AIRCRAFT CARRIER (it really was in the text) and then uses all sorts of exotic weapons which I'm pretty sure an F-117 was never designed to carry. Well, now that that's off my chest, Op-Center is tolerable (barely) as far as techno/spy thrillers go, but it wasn't 1/000 as good as the ""real"", ""pure"" Clancy novels"
1,Key events unreal!,The smartest anti espionage minds in America fall for the old banana in the tailpipe trick? Missles flying through a cave? I am no military expert but I don't believe it. Then the childhood baseball scene takes the cake.Avoid this looser!
4,Entertaining and somewhat insightful,"A good read for anyone really. It provides a view of both sides, both US and the Kurds, and historical information and cultural background to the area.Definitly a good read, and somewhat educational about the conflicts and ideals in the Middle East (atleast as far as the Kurds and Turks go)."
5,Much better than the first Op Center,"I thought that Op Center: Mirror Image was much better than the first Op Center. I like the Striker Team a lot, and was very happy to see so much book time with them."
5,Only For The Die-Hard Clancy Fan,Tom Clancy always seems to come up tops with his techno-thrillers.THis one is no exception.The storyline is complex but readable-for the die-hard clancy fan.Not a good Clancy book to starton.
3,"LONG, DRAWN OUT AND PRETTY BORING",This book starts out looking like it is going to be great and action packed but the more you get into it the more it starts to become boring. This is not one of Clancy's best.
2,Nothing to special,"Ok, i just got done reading this book about a week ago and really its not all that good. The suspence was pretty good but other then that its not much. If you want to read a good book by Tom Clancy I suggest hut For Red October or Rainbow Six"
5,"Awesome, A great depiction of the dealing with terrorists",I just finished the book a couple of days ago and I was very happy with the way the book turned out. The part I liked best was the last few chapters. I won't spoil it for you but the ending it not what you expect. Overall the book has alot of detail. You can tell that Tom Clancy spent alot of time researching the book. The event that is depicted is very realistic and the actions that are taken are also very real. The book does have some gore but not a lot. The main view of the book is government stratigy when dealing with terrorists. The charicters are very well developed. You learn about the family's of the charicters unlike other books. That way you can learn how the charicters handel situations at home and at work.
4,An action packed book!,"I agree that this book is very unrealistic. Although it is a very fictional book, unlike other Op-Center books, this one never seemed to slow down. Tom Clancy is also a very good suspense artist. He always shifts to another scene every chapter leaving you in suspense, wondering about the last chapter. Overall, I found this a very entertaining book that I found hard to put down."
1,Buy any other Clancy-book before you get this one.,"I have read the complete 'Ryan-series', the other op-centers, and Red storm rising. Among those Acts of war is really the worst. Either Clancy is getting old or he didn't write this. The book describes how a bunch of pros fall for little tricks, how incredible hi-tech almost blows it, and a few Rambos save the world. Appaling torture scenes and a rocket flying through a cave supply the icing on this stale cake. Did I mention the DIY-psychology at the end of the book?"
3,Main plot has many logical flaws,"This was my first Clancy novel. I was a little bit dissappointed. Although ornated with some nice intelligence details, the main plot has many flaws at critical points. The fact that only two Turkish soldiers were defending the border-post where the terrorists broke in and the way the dam gets sabotaged sounded all unrealistic to me."
3,Shouldn't be made into a movie!,"Tom Clancy has tried to show loopholes in the russian hierarchy, even the one that had existed in the pre-yeltsin era. He proves that in the intelligence community information must be shared and only like minded people should come together. The failure of the russian op-center is mainly due to backbiting, concealment of information and use of arm twisting techniques. The central idea of the book is the one that appeals the most. It shows that how there could be sane minded people on both sides of a war who understand what hate can bring to mankind. The characters of both the russian and the american protagonists have been handled fairly well except of course the young russian Nikita Orlov who did what any head of a team would have done in his position but the american perspective to this seems to be different."
3,James Bond meets Days of Our Lives,"The first in a new series, I was surprised to find that this book appeared to actually be a sequel to the mini-series. A crisis in North/South Korea has Op-Centre proving its viability to the U.S. President and preventing a war, while its director is pre-occupied with his personal domestic crisis. Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining, but I found the humanistic qualities distracting. Otherwise it would have been a gripping yarn."
3,"Clancy + Pieczenik + Hack = OK thriller, sans plot","I'm not a huge Clancy fan, but I do enjoy the Op-Center series because they're a quick and easy read. Case in point, Acts of War, in which Kurdish terrorists bomb a Turkish damn in an effort to taunt the Turks and Syrians into a conflict. Out of the ashes of this war, the Kurds anticipate a Kurdish state. Add to this mixture a Gadget-laden remote Op-Center (GMC Conversion van with an attitude) that falls into the wrong hands.There's not much in the way of a plot here, but the counter-terrorism measures that are showcased are pretty neat stuff. And, even if the characters don't elicit much empathy from the reader, at least they've got some cracklin' good dialogue. I enjoyed it.comments email me."
1,Op-Center series goes from bad to worse.,"I have been a long time Tom Clancy fan but these Op-Center one week novels are not only goofy, they are bad. That from someone as talented as Clancy, is sad. Please get back with Jack Ryan and let these other people write on their own..."
2,Childer's BEST Album,He's got gems on a lot of records but this is his best work - it flows from start to finish and reveals a whole world of characters and moods. He hasn't matched it again from start to finish.
1,Really one sided!!,"From jayhawkers to Montgomery, to Sheridan to Sherman there are enough wars crimes to fill a DVD library so what what does this ""historical"" video focus on? The South. Once again we just cannot seem to escape the propaganda of the victor. And once again if you want a good overview you will have to pick up a book. Start with ""War Crimes Against Southern Civilians"", a collection of essays that will leave you shaking you head, and explain why the bitterness in the South ran so deep for so long. That is, if you can HANDLE the truth!"
5,Awesome,"This opened my eyes to things I did not know about the Civil War. Things like they used the term ""weapons of mass destruction"". Really! I watched the documentary on the History Channel I had to buy it for my children and grandchildren to watch. Simply fascinating!"
1,"Good encouragement, but very old school","I enjoyed the introduction to the book, but I found that the book contained advice only concerning expository preaching. I was hoping to find a ""how to"" book on various styles, but read only of the old, tired preaching model."
3,Comfortable but not that great,The best thing about this product and that you can wear it all day without thoughts of suicide! Unfortunately it doesn't provide the same results as the uncomfortable ones either. I guess you can't have it all.
3,Informative and comprehensive,This book is ideal for beginning to develop applications and for the need for a better understanding of the different COM aspects. The variety of examples is however limited and builds upon previous shown examples. However the author limits the need of useless repeating. Read this book if you want to understand the different tools but for real development the book is not practical enough.
3,Good first chapter,"The author had a good idea in Chapter 1 for developing the rationale for COM. It was an interesting read, and educational, without hardly even mentioning the term, COM. From there the writing went downhill. I'm an experienced programmer with a fair amount of prior exposure to COM, but the author lost me before the end of his 90-page chapter 2 on designing interfaces. He failed to introduce new terms before using them. He strung dozens of topics together with no apparent connection or organizing framework. Rationale was missing. I labored over this chapter but gained very little understanding. The text was well edited for the most part, but three stars overall is generous."
1,Bad book,I had to read this book for a class and I absolutely hated it. Butler tried to be concise with his history and it was extremely boring and wasn't worth the money.
2,My first blu-ray experience...and with considerable horror!,"Alas, the sets of this Covent Garden production is truly fabulous.I watched 10 minutes in the shop and decided to grab the blu-ray version, to do justice to the sets and costumes, to Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufmann...Alas, I regretted to get the blu-ray version afterwards because once Adriana enters, everybody watching with me screamed aloud. The screaming gained even more momentum when Maurizio enters.Needless to say, the reaction against the casting is overwhelming in my small party of viewers.Things did not improve, because when the Princess appears and starts to 'converse' with Maurizio, everybody started to sigh: poor Maurizio, caught between two old nannies...Enough said, the stars are respectively awarded for the magnificient male cast (Kaufmann and Corbelli), and the sets and music.As for the singing, the cast is generally fine with the exception of the miscasted Ms. Gheorghiu (vocally, too)."
3,Jack it up,"okay this is a functional bottle jack, I used it as a replacement for my 2000 Chevy Suburban because I drove off after fixing a flat and forgot the original Chevy version and well this was $100 cheaper than an OEM replacement model.1. It lifts heavy stuff2. It is a small compact size3. It works4. It is a small form factor5. It is yellow so you will see it when you drive away from it and remember to pick it up."
3,"Nice idea, but ...","I don't find myself using it as much as I thought I would. It's cute, and useful, but a bit pricey for how little I've found myself using it. I guess that's not really the product's fault, but that still makes me consider it just average."
5,******* STUNNING *********,"Just when I was about ready to give up on House, I find this album; it's totally renewed my love for the genre. Every track is soulful, beautiful, richly textured, and deep. The mixing is intelligent, stylish, and seamless - it creates an impressive and unique segue that envelops you in the rich layers of the exquisite percussion, sexy vocals, and elegant piano riffs. And, I have NEVER heard a flute sound so urgent, sophisticated, and true.This is what it's all about people. This album is the new standard for which I will measure all others. I especially, like ""still a dancer,"" ""like a sunshine, my memory,"" and ""portugese love,"" but every track is just stunning and proves that House can achieve the highest levels of artistry and raw perfection, especially in the hands of Lil' Louie Vega, who is truly a Master at Work."
3,"Wheel good, communicator connection bad","I've had two of these wheels and both had the same problem -- the communicator connection was bad. In races on PGR3, I would get complaints about feedback and a bad connection all the time. So I stopped using the communicator when I raced, which hurt the fun of the game. The wheel itself is fine and I actually prefer it to the MS wheel, which was nearly 3 times as expensive. But the communicator problem is serious, and I've heard other owners of the Mad Catz wheel complain about the same problem. I haven't used this wheel in six months and I'm hoping Mad Catz got enough complaints that they finally did something to correct it. Too bad"
5,xbox 360 wired racing wheel,"this wheel is amazing. first of all i saved 40 dollars. it is 100 and i got it on amazon for 60. the racing wheel is leather coated on some parts. their is also a gas and brake petal, but no clutch. plus a shifter like in the mazda. it is plus and minus to switch the gears but with no clutch. the only thing that i would have rather had on this wheel is a clutch. besides that it is perfect. i suggest getting one if you can. the best games to play with the wheel are are the forza motorsports. but midnight club is ok too. have fun with the wheel."
1,Known problem,"I've got this wheel and the voice function does not work. Unfortunately Madcatz's response is ""we know about it but because it's a problem with code and/or products provided to us by MS we can't fix it for you and by the way we will not refund your money"". They did say that sometimes they get wheels from China that have been refurbished and the problem is corrected (which means they know how to fix it they just don't want to spend the money fixing all the bad wheels out there) so if you want to send your wheel in they will replace it with one of these wheels but they don't know how long it will take (they implied it would be months). I'm very unhappy with them and will never buy a Madcatz product again."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,I WAS GIVEN WRONG PRODUCT A WASTE OF MY TIME & GASXbox 360 Wired Racing WheelSCARED OF BUYING IT AGAIN SAME RESULT
1,Did not receive what I ordered,"Shipper sent weong product and would not respond to me email. Very disappointing,Amazon was not helpful in getting the problem solved."
4,Wired Racing Wheel,"I ordered this Racing Wheel, for my car racing games, And I really like it. It is wired in to my Xbox 360 Slim. And, it has about 8'6"" of wiring to reach my Xbox. The unit comes a shifter for changing gears and with the feet controls for Gas andBrakes, and on carpet it stays put! It does not move around. It also has the lap clamps for holding it in your lap if you want. Or it has 3 big suction cups to hold it on a table, I use this alot and, It works very well. I higly recommend to anybody that likes the driving games."
5,kymom,"Was apprehensive about purchasing this over the internet but was pleasently surprised. My little boy spends countless hours playing with this, it is durable, fun, and easy to use."
2,no recommend,"slips and slides around, suction cups do not work well for keeping it in place. absolutely no feel of driving, standard controller works better. going to return it and order another wheel that has force feedback."
3,Broke in 3 months,I got one of these about 3 months ago and ii just broke! Other than that it's a good steering wheel.
5,Great Wheel,Very responsive on auto racing!! my kids love it and makes a world of difference compared to the joystick.
1,Broke after 1 hour of play,"Christmas day, wheel handed off to my 8 year nephew to play with Project Gotham Racing. After one hour the pin from the brake pedal fell out and, from what I could tell of the design of the pedals, I couldn't see how this could last more than a day or two."
1,Piece of junk,"I had purchased one of these wheels and in less than 2 weeks the d-pad died. It cost me over $20 to ship it back for a replacement and the replacement has a buzzing sound in mic jack, the wheel is off center by 15 degrees to the left and the wheel is loose and squeaks horrible. It will cost me another $20 to ship that back for replacement.Save your money and buy the new wireless wheel from MS. The new wireless wheel tracks much better and is very well made.As with all MadCatz products they are made like junk."
5,Just Wonderful! Fell in love with these characters!,"What an excellent, excellent book. It's been a long time since a book has drawn me in to another reality so deeply. ""Grace at Low Tide"" starts slow but once you are in, you are IN! The author created such complex characters and a complex family dynamic that feels so real it almost feels like stumbling upon a family diary. I loved getting to know this family! As an added benefit, I feel the book has uplifted and inspired me by reminding me of all the ways God is present. God was an ever present character in the book. I just discovered this was the author's first novel, WONDERFUL! I will read her others...."
5,"A tender, and beautiful story about God's love, mercy and grace","This is a beautiful, well-written story about a young girl who will truly capture your heart. Hart's writing brings you into the story as if you were a part of it. She had me laughing outloud and at the same time in tears. This story about God's great love, mercy, and redemption has truly blessed my life and most importantly, encouraged me and given me hope."
2,Not what I expected,"I didn't like this book very much but I really like Beth Webb Hart and loved ""The Wedding Machine"". That was a good book that I enjoyed very much. Not for the teen table at all. Sometimes I think that Beth Webb Hart has seen a lot in her life and has taken note of it all. I look forward to reading more of her books even though this one wasn't one of my favorites, I still enjoy her insights. In a way she reminds me of John D. MacDonald who muses about the human condition and assures us that we all have thoughts that frustrate us whether it's over ruthless development of a beautiful land or of how society is so much more crass than ever before. BTW MacDonald's books are NOT Christian lit so just wanted to warn you there. But his sensitivities are about the same as far as the land and the human condition aside from the fact that Beth Webb Hart's focus of hope is in God (which is a huge difference)."
4,A Tender Coming-of-Age Story,"Fifteen-year-old DeVeaux is faced with choices and changes when her father, a formerly affluent and respected Charleston resident, goes bankrupt and moves the family to a much more isolated and much less refined life an on island nearby. DeVeaux, the youngest of the family, deals with her father's breakdown, her mother's illness, and her older siblings' and cousin's troubles, as well as her own relationship and friendship intricacies.The story is understated, peaceful, intimate. You feel as though you're sitting on the front porch swing with DeVeaux as she relates the saga of the past six months to you. It avoids cliches without being overly cynical. And in my opinion, it is more well-written than many other contemporary Christian novels."
2,Not really that useful,"I don't particularly care for this now that I've got it and am trying to organize my Dremel around it. First, while the two see through side areas have plenty of molded holes in the plastic, they are pretty close together and aren't really practical. I would guess you can use every other one, maybe up to two thirds if you have a bunch of skinny bits or extra mandrels. Once you flip it open, you are no better off. The inside of the case is under sized and you can't fit any of the ""kits"" like the sanding and grinding or cleaning and polishing in there.I would suggest letting this one go. I'm thinking that I'll put this out for recycling and move my Dremel into a fishing tackle box. Should have thought of that from the start."
1,"Bad case for the money. Too cheap, too small.","I purchased a full package deal with my dremel. I have eight attachments and tons of tools. I thought this tool box would suit my needs. It does not. It doesn't even hold all of the accessories that came with my dremel. It also is solid plastic. The hinge for the lid is a strip of thin plastic, it isn't even a real hinge. I would have paid $5 for this box, not $20. Do yourself a favor and spend the same amount for a better box (fisherman's tackle box) at K-Mart, Wal-Mart, or Meijer."
5,Fantastic,"Great toolbox for dremel, works just as described. Plenty of space & solid carrying handle"
3,Poor Constuction,For the money this is one of the cheapest built tool cases I own. Poor case for a great tool.
3,small,the case is alright for the cordless Dremel tool and the corded tool but there is no room for the straight edge that comes with the corded Dremel.
5,rotary tool storage box,"Plastic box that holds many rotary tools and tool accessories ,space for loose {under lid} or holes for stationary tool storage.Has space for rotary tool storage,with room for flexshaft and saw and etc.For the price it's a bargain to keep you organised."
1,"hmm, isn't this exactly like her Celtic Magic book?","Granted, I was a newbie Pagan when I first got this book, soon after I read Conway's Celtic Magic, and I realized that *It Was The Same Book With The Names Changed!* Yes folks, that is right, the rituals were almost identicle, the invocations, etc. I have avoided Conway's books ever since. Her information is not accurate. If you must, use it for inspiration on Norse Wicca, not to learn anything about Asatru, or traditional Norse ceremonies."
2,only a tiny silver lining in the cloud,"THe only redeeming feature of this book is her concise retelling of some of the Norse myths; however, I agree with a previous reviewer that one is likely to get much more from Kevin Crossley-Holland's books. Her lack of knowledge on how the Norse actually viewed their gods is appalling. To say that Freya is a moon goddess is false. In fact, in the Norse pantheon, the sun was viewed as female and the moon was male! Her research is pretty thin."
2,"Good start, Poor middle, Fine ending.","Though starting out fine with norse ideals, The book really falls short after the beginning by focusing on wicca rituals."
1,More Fluff,"From a publisher that specializes in New-Age fluff and fantasy, this book is particularly aggravating for anyone genuinely into the Northern Traditions.What really strikes one, is the lack of any effort to make this in any way true to the historical sources. It seems to be yet another cynical excercise in mix and match, New-Age formula ""tradition"". Just pick the higlights out of a childrens book on Mythology, and plug it into a basic Wiccan framework. It has been done before, & done better (Buckland's Seax-Wicca), if you really like this kind of fantasy ""tradition""."
1,Complete and utter garbage,"This book is complete and utter garbage. Conway knows nothing about the gods and the mythology of the norse. It makes Fitch's Rites of Odin look well written.As a Lokisgodhi, I found her comments on Loki to be specious to the point of being disrespectful. Most of the things she has written have no basis in reality.Shame on her and Llewellyn for publishing it. If there's not a nithing pole with her name on it somewhere, there should be.This book is totally useless. Don't buy it unless there's a tolet paper shortage."
1,huh,"conway needs to do her research, this like celtic magic was really bad, all it is water down norse wicca, she needs to write more books like dancing with dragons or magickal,mystical, and mythical beasts or moon magick. that stuff she knows about but not this stuff."
1,Awful trash! Inaccurate! Should be named Norse Wicca,"Length:: 4:46 MinsThis is an awful book full of wrong and incorrect historical information. This is just a rehashed version of her other book Celtic Magic. She basically copied and pasted and changed a few names here and there. No new information. Newbies beware, this book will confuse and give wrong impressions of Norse/Northern traditions. Should be named Norse Wicca or Wicca with a Norse flavor."
2,"Not bad, but not good","Overall, I can't say much beyond what others have written about this book. It's more wiccan than Norse, and any Astaru worshiper would be appalled at how Conway writes. Mind you, ANYTHING Conway writes is Wiccan based, be it Norse Magick, or Dragon Magick, or any other book they have written. Nice for beginners, but beyond new ritual ideas, nothing else is any good. (I have a feeling Conway jumped on the money making wagon that other wiccan writers seem to have and lost all sense of why they are writing this stuff) However, it's not all bad, just most of it. Some of the stuff in it is not so bad, if a little basic and full of fluff."
3,"Fenrir, sick 'er!","This book has value in being Norse Mythology Lite, a quick and not comprehensive overview of what's going down in Asgard. However, I would recommend you find the Poetic and Prose Eddas to get at the meat of the Norse Gods. And by the way, D.J., some of us LIKE Loki and get along well with him. Cheers."
5,Fantastic,I had Beginning Callanetics in VHS. I love it and figured it is about time I update and get the DVD. I think this is her very best project. Her other ones are good but this one is GREAT!!! It really works for losing inches and getting flexible.
3,useful but boring,useful but boring . . . .great exercises based on simple and logical concepts and varied progressive difficulty levels. If you have the willpower you are sure to have great results.
4,like this exercise plan,"I've had recent foot surgery & haven't had a chance to use the CD, but I've done this plan before & it's great."
4,Excellent value for the price,"I totally disagree with the prior review. I have had this printer for a couple of years and it has been extremely reliable, with very few paper jams. And clearing the paper jams is quite easy, actually, if you know what you're doing - it's an almost straight paper path with access from the rear as well as the front of the printer. (Perhaps the previous reviewer should take the time to read the manual -- what a concept!) The print quality is excellent and the speed is terrific, especially for a printer in this price range. My only quibble is that HP refused to provide a Windows Vista driver for this printer, so -- although the printer still works fine -- I don't have all the features I used to have under XP Pro (like duplexing, which I now have to do manually). This is a very good printer, especially if you're still running Windows XP."
4,Awesome Games! Shoddy Compilation,"I have always loved Space Quest and it's great to be able to play the old ""3D Animated Adventure Games"" (As we called them in the day) on a modern computer. They all look great and act great, but it feels very pieced together. In a game so heavy with copy protection, it would have been nice to have an actual instruction book, instead of having to print the copy protection out. And the documentation is just the documentation of a previous collection that had Space Quest 1 - 5 and then they tacked on Space Quest 6. Nothing new was added and the older version of Space Quest 1 was left out. Still, what you're paying for is the games, and the games are worth every penny! I highly reccomend picking this up while it's still on the shelves!"
3,"Worth it, but not as good as the nostalgic hype","The games were fun, but not engrossing. There were a couple of mild glitches where the controls did not react fast enough for the challenge that your character is facing so it is difficult to complete certain levels, especially on episode 2."
5,No paper manuals??? only on disc,"I don't know about the rest of you, but when I recently ordered my Space Quest (New) from AMazon, the game itself was great and works great only 1 issue: it looked used!First off, there was no shrinkwrap. Second, the box was basically empty except for the disc in a paper sleeve. and one small peice of paper with loading instructions.Other than that, the game is great and works well on Windows XP. A great resurrection of this classic game I enjoyed as a youth! Brings back memories.Our janitor hero is back!Thanks for reading."
4,Makes bath time more comfortable but don't rely on the temperature indicator,"We combined this pad with our ""First Years Infant to Toddler Tub"" and it made our month old son more comfortable at bath time. He likes sitting down in the warm water and this pad makes that easier than the ""hammock"" that came with the tub. I would have given it 5 stars but the temperature disc is basically just a sticker that was coming off before we even used the pad. Also, once the sticker gets too hot and turns white it stays white for a long time(20-30 minutes). It takes so long that you won't be able to wait for it to tell you that the water is safe. We rely on a separate thermometer for that. So, if you want a comfortable pad to add to your hard bath tub, it is great, but don't rely on the temperature indicator."
1,water did NOT stay warm for ours,"Our daughter hated bath time so I got this hoping to have something soft for her to relax on while she had her much dreaded bath. I used it twice. Once in a ""baby tub"" and once in our own tub (in two inches of water). In both instances I had the water temp set to within the safety bar of our bath water tester. In the time it took me to walk from the tub to carry my baby across the bathroom when I set her down onto the foam - it was FREEZING COLD!!! Granted this was during December, but we had the bathroom door closed with the heat on so the room itself was quite warm. Then I noticed that the foam never got completely dry. It stayed wet for days (during the dry winter months mind you) talk about a germ harbor! I consider this to be a waste of money."
5,Lp Sleeve Version=Excellent Sound,"This is my favorite Bruce cd and the sound on this Japanese LP Sleeve version is fantastic. Far superior to the domestic release to my ears. ""Tunnel Of Love"" and ""One Step Up"" never sounded better."
3,Time Tunnel,"I've never been a true Springsteen follower. His, ""Born In The USA"" was one of his best releases. There is also, ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"" that is a true classic and then there is ""Tunnel of Love."" Moody, somewhat lackluster, yet catchy and memorable at the same time! That ain't an easy thing to do. I've waited a long time to find this remastered. Sound is excellent and, listening to this brings back a lot of old memories....some good, some not so good. If you're a Springsteen fan this is a must have. If you are new to his music this is one that will have you coming back to it over and over again as there is just something there that begs the question: ""Hey, wanna check me Out""?"
3,"Decent Art Clips, Bad Service","Getting this software installed was a bear. Reluctant to pay more for phone support than I paid for the software itself, I elected to work through the problems using Broderbund's e-mail support. Most of the suggestions I received from Broderbund's technicians didn't address my stated concerns. In fact, I'm suspicious the technicians weren't even reading my messages but were sending me ""standard troubleshooting suggestion #1"" followed by ""standard troubleshooting suggestion #2,"" etc. As such, it took nearly a week to receive the suggestion that actually solved my problem. If you don't mind feeling like a chump and wasting about 3.5 hours in total, the program delivers a lot of good clickart for the money."
4,woot,an amazing autobiography that tells the tale of a man who is completely tripped out on either drugs or schizophrenia. The line between reality and disillusion is often hard to figure out. Quite a read.
1,DOES NOT WORK ON MODERN COMPUTERS,"If you have a computer running anything but the software listed on this page, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. It DOES NOT WORK. My son found Ruff's Bone on YouTube and I bought this disc, even though I saw the other review about the OS, because I thought, well, OK, it didn't work on XP but maybe it'll work now. I now have a very disappointed child and feel like a prize idiot."
1,Pretty mean,"After you read this book, you may not like Jackie or anybody that she knew. Not a kind word for any character, except maybe Caroline.Even Jackie looks like a nasty hypocrite.I'd pass."
1,A crass and base piece of fiction,I found this book to be a crass and base work that relies on sensationalism and sexual depictions to make an impression. Obviously would not recommend it.
5,it was great!,"i just loved this book and even though i kept in mind throughout the whole novel that it was strictly fiction i really felt like i was reading jackie's journals throughout the most difficult, dramatic, and emotional roller coaster like years of her life. the novel just makes you wonder if these secret fictional memoirs superbly written by ruth francisco resemble any hidden truth about this most private woman. i just thought the book was captivating, telling all yet mysterious at the same time, i read it in two nights and then i read it again and again. if you're looking for an interesting vivid read on jackie o you should definitely read this one."
1,trash,I hope and pray that Caroline Kennedy and Robert Kennedy's children never read one page of this book.I guess you can say anything at all about someone when they are dead and buried and cannot come to their own defense.
3,a rather confusing book,"this book is a little confusing to read at first, especially if you dont read it in one sitting (i read it on a bus). the book has a great art style, but it has this wierd technique where they will show a person's reaction to a speach bubble rather than show the person speak, so, it makes you wonder who is speaking, other than that, you should read it twice, once to get used to the style, and another time to actually enjoy it, but be warned, the main girl character wears a skimpy top that the author ""shows off"" at time, if you cant tolerate that that (personally im can) maybe you should read a different manga.3/5 stars ~ good manga, but too much work on our part"
4,Not bad for a quick read,"I picked up this book because I wanted to improve my ability to network and make business contacts. The majority of the book is common sense advice and is fairly helpful. You're not going to read anything particularly novel nor innovative by any means (contrary to what some of these reviews might lead you to believe). It's a quick read and has some good reminders, but it's mostly just good advice slightly adapted to the business world. I'd recommend the book, but don't expect to hear anything you haven't heard before."
4,good book,"This book deals mostly with NLP applications (of course, one can expect that)but it also talks about our Social, private, etc. space. This is something I resonate with.It has good exercises but if you're an avid reader, you'd probably read all that thisbook mentions, before."
1,Bad quality,"I ordered this twice and both arrived broken. I don't know if it's the quality or the packing, but I would not recommend this piece."
5,A well earned tribute,"This book is a beautiful,thought provoking tribute to the wonderful service provided by the trained search and rescue operations carried out by these dogs, with particular emphasis on 9/11.Over 100 life sized German Shepherd forms were distributed to artists to paint in any fashion they wished to celebrate these animals.The results were exceptional.Each piece of art was given a name ,displayed and later auctioned off with the proceeds used for the future benefit of these dogs.Each piece of art is explained by the artist and there is also a short note about the artist.Overall this is a well put together coffee table sized book and should be appreciated by everyone."
3,The Great Mystery Solved,"Actually, it is very simple. The Ancient Race unravels the mystery of God and the Bible. The book is a word puzzle, just as is life. It explains the reason God let light into the deep and demonstrates the fluidity of words along the way. The author brings to the surface the hidden meanings of words. There are many areas of the book that are cloaked in absolutes, but, over all, the book betrays the truth about God and his creation. I would suggest that the book be read until it is understood."
2,It's about invisible people,"There are 3 books. They are hard to follow. Book 3 explains these invisible people the best. I don't see them. There is tremendous description of these Comanchero fishermen, but I can't see them. They are supposed to cause all the terrible happenings of the world. The book says they're everywhere. I don't see them. I was frustrated by the book. I guess I'm one of the blind ones."
1,Part didn't work,"The product that I received didn't function. It was obviously poorly assembled and missing a part. I would have returned it but since it was a low dollar amount, it was too much a nuisance to go thru the complaining/shipping process. I will not purchase healthcare products again from Amazon. It would have been significantly easier if I had just purchased it from the store in the mall."
4,Sonicare Brush Head Works Wonders,"I really enjoy the clean feeling when I use this item. I still use a standard brush in the morning before work to help speed things along, but this brush really does a much better job. Have been using for over 1.5 years. Haven't used any other mech. toothbrushes ever... take this for what its worth!"
5,My Fav Album of All Time,"This is my fav album of all time. Yeah, its dark and pessimistic. No it doesn't go down like a spoonful of sugar. But, its a part of me for better or worse. I think better, but I'm biased. The beginning of the holy trinity. Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning. This album starts off (not quite literally [because of a line or two]) with the statement ""I must insist on being a pessimist"" and Warning ends with the closing lines ""Because I'm thinking about A brand new hope The one I've never known Cause now I know It's all that I wanted"".Pessimism to Hope. Now thats a powerful message and a powerful transistion to move through in the space of three albums. I've grown up with Green Day. These three albums are my soul. Hope you enjoy them too."
4,"Not the best, but still pretty good.","I don't think this is the best album but i still like it.There are a lot of catchey songs like ""stuart and the Ave."" and ""Brat"". And i forgot to mention ""Stuck with me"" That is one of my favorite songs on the album. If you get this Cd and don't think it's the best ""Green Day"" Cd. I don't blame you because there are other green day Cd's that are better. But I still suggest that you get this Cd because it's a good cd."
4,Despite Warning,"Despite the SEVERE disappointment of Warning, I can't help but give positive reviews to Insomniac. Insomniac is the angriest, darkest Green Day album thus far. I doubt anything this punk will ever be put out by Green Day again. Because of this album, Green Day has to be respected as a very talented punk band, regardless of future releases. No matter their status as sell-outs, this is a highly regarded album by many who choose to be open minded about Green Day's decisions so many years after they were made. It's a mistake to judge this album based solely on personal opinions of the band."
3,NOT WORTH IT.,"Good cd, but not worth it. Download certain songs off of I-Tunes. 86, Armatage Shanks, Brain Stew, Jaded, Stuck With Me, and Stuart and the Ave. are good. That's why I gave it 3 stars. [...]"
3,A couple of hits,"This was an OK CD. It had some good songs,(Geek Stink Breath, Brain Stew) and some OK ones and then just some I couldn't even listen to. Not a great Green Day CD."
2,Is it me or isn't this the same set of songs on the last 5 albums?,"I liked the first Green Day work - it was original, a bit too punky and whitetrash for me, but decent to listen too. After dropping VERY large money for the last two albums I realized I was buying the same music just repackaged. Even the Live versions on Foot In mouth sound exactly the same. Save your money; either buy one of the first 2-3 albums of theirs or better yet, try something new."
2,this is GREEN DAY ?,"In the long tradition of great Green Day albums this one was a complete let down. there are a few good songs but most of the album is very scattered in its direction. This is so hard for a die hard Green day fan to say but DONT BUY THIS ALBUM, but please check out the other great Green Day albums like "" DOOKIE "" or "" NIMROD"""
1,I wish I could give it ZERO stars,"This album is a discrace to music. It is a discrace to NOISE! Sloppy chord progressions, a fake english accent, too much distortion, too little of a band -- THAT is this album. I can't understand what makes people like that stuff...Greenday seems more conserned with image..."
1,Bargain Bin Material,"My first Green Day album was Dookie. I played it non-stop for months. Then I bought Insomniac, played through it once, and angrily hurled it into the trashcan. Don't bother with this half-hearted, sloppy, uninspired noise. Five stars? Hah! I've heard garage band recordings that sounded better!"
1,Pretend this one wasn't made,"I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. Green Day admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the ""I'm still punk"" notion which fortunately Green Day gave up years later.I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew's refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.In general, unless you are a major Green Day fan, there really isn't much you're missing in this album."
3,gd's biggest fan,"I AM GREEN DAYS BIGGEST FAN! no doubt about that. my first gd cd was the american idiot single i havnt got that album yet. even though american idiot is the funniest and best song ever! i saw this album ""insomniac"" and i noticed it was by green day i was soooo excited!!! as i did not know they had any other other albums. so i made my mum buy me this for me and it is ok. they sound a bit different as it is older. but because it is green day it is cool. i am going to buy to buy another gd cd called nimrow soon. hooray.!."
3,...Closer to a 3.5...,"...I had great expectations for Insomiac, but sadly i was disappointed with Green Day's second major debut album.Overall, Insomiac basically is a continuation of Dookie execpt a little less energitic and less powerful.However, 'Geek STink Breath' and 'Brain Stew' eventually became relatively successful singles. I found the overall album not extremely impressive and at times boring.If you want a good Green Day album get Dookie or Nimrod..."
4,So good I can't sleep.,"I won't say that ""Insomniac"" is their best album, but I will say that it's easily my favorite. It rocks all the way through, all 32 minutes of it. I also have to admit, that of all the songs on here, I really do like the hits the most. ""Geek Stink Breath"" is completely addictive, and ""Walking Contradiction"" is pop-punk perfection. Of course the rest is killer as well, like ""Stuck With Me"", ""Panic Song"", and ""Bab's Uvula Who?"". These guys may have been knocked for becoming too popular, but there's no doubt they are talented, and almost solely responsible for bringing punk into the 90's and beyond. Let them make your (green) day."
4,What Dookie Was Missing,"Following Dookie returned in 1995 with the harder hitting Insomniac. In many ways this album has what Dookie was missing on a lot of it's songs, better playing and better lyrics from Billie Joe Armstrong. Also almost all of the songs could have been hit singles, well except Panic Song, as the A.D.D. generation would lose track around the midway part of the incredible instrumental opening. A great record that is worth buying but is just short of the perfect mark."
2,Dour chords,"While some of the energy may be intact, songwriting abilities were becoming all-too-predictably limited."
5,Could it be? Is this better than Green Day's Dookie?!,"With Insomniac, Green Day took everything that was great about Dookie, and amped it up to the next level, much like Weezer's transition from the Blue Album to Pinkerton. It's darker, sure, but they found a way to take the sound of Punk-Rock and make it something so much more. The passion behind this album is intense, and sorely underrated.I tried thinking of the key tracks, but really, it's easier and shorter to list off the forgettable ones. Every single song on this album stands out except, for me, the Panic Song and Stuart and the Ave. Other than that, this album is solid gold. If you're a punker looking for some inspiration with your band, or just want to hear something great that you'll be playing non-stop for days, this album is essential. It's also great to start off with as a new Green Day fan."
3,Geek Stink...,"Everybodys heard of Green Day, you know the band your average punk rocker loves to hate, because they got famous and ""sold out."" Insomniac is Green Day doing what they do best, which is catchy pop/punk songs with attitude. ""Geek Stink Breath"" was actually a radio hit at one time and it never gets old, however, with the exception of tracks like ""86"" and ""Stuart and the Ave"" the rest of this CD can get boring and repetative very quick. Insomniac has its moments, but its not Green Day's best album."
4,This cd is better than Kerplunk.,It could be a bit better. I thinks it is second best out of all the cd's thay have made. Nimrod is the best though.
5,Green Days most impressive album.,"It'll just blow you away.Simple as that.Today, I don't even want to think about what happened to this band, its just shamefull.Music from the 90s sounds even better and more refreshing than it did when it came out, and to think this album has been around for almost 10 years, it just shows you that good music can't be shaken or move by trends, or popularity its as solid as a rock and won't be moved.At present all this new music thats coming out at the moment is utter crap.Its shame Green Day succumbed to that too.Listen to this album in 30 years time, it'll sound even more unique and amazing."
5,COOL ALBUM BUT NOT THEIR BEST,"THIS ALBUM IS GREAT, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS DOOKIE. I REMEMBER WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND MY FRIEND GOT IN ON TAPE. YES KIDS TAPE. ANYWAY THE SONGS HERE ARE SOLID, BUT NOT THEIR BEST EFFORT."
3,they let me down,"i agree with someone who think this album is not good or cool enough ,all songs are tiresome ,but anyway i still continue to love green day forever"
3,What happened?,"Dookie was awesome. So was Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours was good. But all of a sudden, Green Day seemed to lose it. This is not a bad a album, but compared to the other four Green Day albums, it falls short. It has its good songs, like ""Geek Stink Breath,"" ""Stuart and the Avenue,"" ""Jaded,"" and ""Walking Contradiction,"" but songs like ""No Pride"" or ""Tight Wad Hill"" don't cut it."
3,Not as good as Dookie but a very good punk album,"Really, GD didn't spend much time on this one to make it sound good enough, but it still is Green Day and it still is a very good album."
5,What on earth's wrong with you guys?,"What on earth's wrong with you guys? This album is great and sooo underrated! I love Walking Contradiction and I used to hate Geek Stink Breath but now I've heard it a couple of times I love it and the title's quite witty. I love the video for walking contradiction. And I'm sure the other songs are just as good. I was wrong about Greenday being rubbish! What a stupid thing to think! Silly me! But it is just one of ten fantastic albums! Listen to this, they'll be one of the greatest bands in history!"
5,"SO GREAT I DON""T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT!!!!","GREEN DAY IS MY FAVORITE GROUP EVER! I KNOW THIS C.D. INSIDE OUT! tHE SONGS ARE SO CATCHY AND I SING THEM ALL THE TIME. AT SCHOOL I'M SINGING,""CUZ I'M A WALKING CONTRADICTION, AND I AIN'T GOT NO RIGHTS"". AT DINNER I'M SINGING ""MOM AND DAD DON'T LOOK SO HOT THESE DAYS. THEIR GETTING OVER THE HILL."" From SONG #2. IF YOU BUY THIS CD YOU WILL BE OVER WHELMED WITH GREAT FAST PACED PUNK ROCK."
4,Never gets old,This cd has lots of songs that never get old although there are not too many. I suggest that you buy this cd if you are a fan and/or you don't have it.
5,A Great Follow-up to 'Dookie',"Of course 'Dookie' will go down as the definitive Green Day album, but this album's way more abrasive than 'Dookie.' This was a response to all of the fans that said that they were punk sellouts and that Billie Joe was having sleeping problems (hence the title). Sure there might be traces of the 'pop' punk riffs on Dookie, but Billie Joe's vocals are more aggressive, as well as Tre's drumming, Mike's bass playing and Billie Joe's distinctive guitar tones.It's short, it's fast, it's heavy, it's abrasive, and I'm certainly glad that it is not a carbon copy of Dookie. It's definitely one of their best albums, for me it's second to NIMROD."
4,BETTER THAN DOOKIE!,"this album is a classic, no other words can describe it, a pretty short album, with 2 minute songs, but kicks ...! if you liked kerplunk, you'll love this album!, no punk pop...heck, it's not pop at all! it's hard punk, rip rockin green day! dookie will never sound the same!"
3,Not the best Green Day album but still good,This is Insominac Green Day have somehow let themselves down a little bit here because the record starts off drownish and luckly gets better as the record get's up to 86 now this is when it changes and you get all the cool punk stuff anyway if you are a die hard Green Day fan buy this now but if you are a regular joe who is just trying out Green Day for the first time go to better records like Dookie or Nimrod.
1,"Wow, THEY REALLY ARE PUNK!!!","Ah yes, this is the album that contains the classic single (and anarchist anthem) ""Geek Stink Breath"". I believe it was The Clash who originally penned that one. Or maybe it was the Dead Kennedys. No wait wasn't it the title of a book by that Nietzsche guy. Wow! ""Geek Stink Breath"" THEY REALLY PUNK ME OUT!"
1,Horrible,"This CD is horrible. My mom bought it for me and I thought it was going to be good like the American Idiot album. It was good at first but then when on the second minute of the first track, I felt the need to turn off the DVD Player which I used to play the CD."
3,Green Day's An Insomniac,"INSOMNIAC is part of the record product that has led Green Day to be the band that it is today. Released in 1995, this album showed that Green Day still had a lot to learn in performing to the top of their genre, but the band was good at what they already knew. With a hard grudgy punk sound, the rock band played their hardest on their guitar, bass, and drums. Joel added his own uniquality to the group with his upbeat and entertaining lyrics. His words are what made this punk band stand out from many of the others they were in competetion with. A great apsect of the group is that they are in time with each other. That in itself is an accomplishment in the style this band performs in. INSOMNIAC is a fair rocker album, and one to give some attention to.Stand out tracks include:""Brat""""No Pride""""Stuart and the Ave.""""Westbound Sign"""
5,Butchers Broom,This seems to be an excellent product!! I am using this daily and will let you know how it turns out!
5,Wonderful Magazine,This is a wonderful magazine. The articles have substance and the resources/ideas on being green and growing a more conscience family are wonderful.
5,Holiday,"My kids ages 12,10, 8 enjoy all of Clements books, safe for the kids and good down to earth material"
5,Authentic,"Kid readers have very good baloney detectors. This book passes the test.The plot is straightforward. A fed up teacher puts the kids in chorus in charge of coming up with their own show. Hart, a member of the cool table, learns how to actually earn the right to lead. The other kids learn how to argue and cooperate. The adults develop new respect for the kids, and the kids learn to appreciate the adults' help.Of course it's fiction, and of course the bittersweet ending is pretty much pre-ordained, but you could say that about ""War and Peace"", too. Seems to me that the kids are real enough, the dialogue is close enough, the plotting is honest enough, and the message is sincere enough, that a young reader will be pleased to have read this, and will feel he has accomplished something and maybe learned something. That works for me."
4,Another great one!,"I'm an adult, but I still love Andrew Clements' engaging writing style and creative storytelling. One thing I appreciate about Clements' writing is that it's continually unpredictable - I was sure I knew which direction this particular story was going, but in the end, I was surprised! Without giving away the plotline, I thought the story was very realistic. Definitely read the author's note at the end, too!"
5,A Spectacular Story!,"I really enjoyed this story!! Hart Evans is a very popular sixth grade student at Palmer Intermediate. One afternoon he found himself landed in the principal's office after deciding to launch rubber bands at Mr. Meinert, the chorus director. After some convincing, the principal decided on a light punishment for Hart. This angered Mr. Meinert and therefore led to his decision to turn the Holiday concert planning over to his students. After all, Mr. Meinert had nothing to lose; his position would be terminated after the holiday break due to budget cuts.Hart was chosen as the student leader and would spend the next several weeks attempting to direct the holiday concert. You will have to read this page turner to discover how the concert turns out. Although, I can tell you that it is full of surprises and emotion."
2,not yet,"I will not buy this until the Nelson Bible commentary becomes available than I will buy both. Why do we not have all books out here to choose from? If,you hate this book do not buy it if you liked it in print than why not have the opportunity to get it on kindle?"
4,student reviews,A real good reference work. I also have this on my LOGOS program and go to this material often. In my future as a full time student I see many times of going back to this material. Highly recommend this not only in the students library but in any one serious about biblical studies.
4,Good seller and product,"Seller ships promptly, which is a plus when dealing with online merchants. The product packaging looked slightly different than in the past, but not sure if the manufacturer has updated the look or not. Hopefully this is not from an older batch that has been sitting in a warehouse for a while."
3,not 100% happy,I do not think that this product does all it claims to. Also no instructions on how to return the product.
5,Great Find!,"I can't add anything to the other reviews regarding the band or band members, but you can bet I plan on checking out their previous works for sure. I'm not sure what thread I followed to find this, but I'm glad I did. I previewed the entire album on Amazon, and 'Mr Qwinkles Therapy' really caught my attention. After listening to that several times I knew I had to have the whole album. I've been listening to this album on my commute all week, and love it more every time! Great guitar! I don't really understand some of the negative remarks about the vocals, though.One breath of fresh air; No insane speed drumming like with so many 'progressive metal' groups!I don't feel inspired to write reviews often, but this group definitely deserves to be 'found' by others."
2,"Technically good, doesn't flow","I'm sorry, I have to be one of the few to downplay this album. Technically, the musicianship is good but the songwriting sucks. The lyrical subject matter is indeciferable at times and just not very interesting. Ted Leonard (vocals) sounds better than he has in a long time but, as one reviewer states, there's just too many notes on this album. For Dream Theater that may work but not here. Needs more style and substance."
3,"Nice, but sometimes confussing.","A love Enchant, that is way I wanted this album, Enchant's singer Ted Leonard sings here. And the Album is ok, the musician are great, a Ted singing is fine but you never have a feeling of wholeness. It sounds a lot like Liquid Tension, every one doing something different to impress the listener.If they release another album I hope this will change, the band shows a lot of talent."
1,Don't Buy,"I purchased a Singer Inspiration 4206 in June 2009. This Singer product has been nothing but a disappointment. I am an experienced seamstress and was very disappointed with the performance from this machine. Very light weight, this is my first plastic sewing machine, it literally hops around as you sew. I have had to replace the bobbin case 3 times and it still does not sew correctly. All previous machines I've owned were metal. I am going looking for a metal machine. Don't waste your money on this plastic defective Singer."
1,what a waste,"I've always liked singer. I had this one about a year with less than 25 hours on it and the plastic gears went on it. Don't get this one, it's a waste of money."
3,not obvious but mono,"Please note, though not mentioned on the front cover of the CDs, this recording is mono, not stereo. Unfortunately it was recorded during the period when EMI was only recording stereo intermittently in London, and not in the ""burbs"". Otherwise a solid Sargent-scale recording."
5,My nephew is in love~,"I saw this dinosaur at a local store and it was soon gone, so I'm glad I was able to find it online. It's unusual enough to see a brachiosaurus, especially one as soft and cuddly as this! He has a new home with my young nephew, who takes him to bed every night and can't sleep without him. Definitely the caliber of a child's best friend! In person, he looks much more brown and the green is quite subtle, but you know what they say: a good dinosaur is never a bad colour."
5,awesome live cd,its great to hear they have reformed and recorded this killer live cd.ive been wanting this for a while now.
5,The best MMORPG ever,"after almost 7 years ultima online is still one of the best MMORPG's out there. I played for 2 years before i left, but now that the new 7th anaversary is released im definatly going to get back into the game. Starting out as a new player in this game is easy, there are lots of people to help you, and there are special new player quests to help you learn the ropes of the game. I reccomend this game to anyone. Ultima has a huge playerbase and a HUGE world to explore. (in my 2 years of playing i still didnt see it all) The Crafting in this game is perfect too, for example you can be a Tailor, Blacksmith, Tinker, Alchemist, Scribe (makes spells) and you can learn the art of poisoning! This game has so much to offer, 5 out of 5 stars easy!"
3,Interested in this game if you are selling,"Im Interested in this game if you are selling, stephaniemonica@yahoo.com is my info, I will discuss info i need to know about the product, thanks"
1,"Junk. Used to be good, but now sheer junk.","Due to wreckless game masters and constant customer abuse, I am closing my account with this game. STAY AWAY! Unspoken policies are abundant, and exist everywhere, making avoiding a ban like running from the gestapo!!!The game used to have a wonderful gameplay system, the patches are wrecking it into oblivion. Less new players are coming in, and more players are leaving. I suggest you all stay away from this title."
2,"Used to be fun, but too outdated now","I played Ultima Online for three years, beta-tested UO:Third Dawn, and finally left to play EverQuest. I even came back last year to try it again, and it was the same old stuff... just a different wrapper on it. Ultima Online was a revolutionary game in its day, and was the ONLY game I played for a couple of years; it had all I needed in a game! But it has not grown with the times as many other MMORPGs have. After 3 years of UO, 3 years of EQ, a shot at Star Wars: Galaxies, and beta-testing Lineage II (a very good game), I am currently playing City of Heroes, and love it! However, if you're looking for a good fantasy-based MMORPG, I'd wait for EverQuest II. This UO:7th Anniversary Edition isn't worth the plastic it's wrapped in."
1,EA : We Destroy Worlds,"This game is so out-dated and the so called (new) 3D graphics are just horrible.Al they add is new re-hued items.Actually EA is selling the same old crap over and over again.Because of E-Bay everyone had 100 of millions of gold coins.I would not recomment this game to anyone.This game once a great game but because of all the expansions and the splitting of land mass into PVP and non PVP, it lost all it had to offer.A much better game would be Lineage 2"
1,Durability not good,I have had the brush for less than a year. It has developed cracks around the on'off button and is no longer usable.It does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth but the brush should last longer than one year.
3,Overrated,"It is a fancy electric toothbrush. I'm not so impressed. The 2 minute timer, however, does get me to brush for the right amount of time..."
1,Amazon was irresponsible and I never received my sonicare,I waited two weeks to receive my Sonicare ordered through Amazon and I never received it. I'm sure it's a wonderful product but now I will never know (actually I'll order it through drugstore.com so I will know soon enough). Amazon was incredibly unhelpful and I had to chase a package around until finally it got cancelled. Amazon prides itself on its personal recommendations but I'm terribly disappointed with their level of service and advise others not to use them.
2,Kind of toothpaste matters!,I have had a sonicare toothbrush for two years. I like how it cleans and enjoy using it. I am presently on my third handle. Cracks keep appearing in the handles or part where the brush is screwed on. Sonicare has replaced them but tell me that they will no longer do this because I use baking soda or peroxide toothpaste. They claim paste with these ingredients cause the material to crack. You might want to be aware of this before purchasing.
3,A bit clunky and awkward,"After having used the Conair Interplak and experiencing poor battery life and power to the unit, I switched to Sonicare.I've used it one day and I'm not impressed. The unit is bulky and awkward to use. There is a metal post behind the brush head that interferes at times with brushing. Although it did clean my teeth, I wouldn't be able to handle this unit for long. The InterPlak product I previously mentioned is excellent^2 at cleaning your teeth, but the battery life is woefull. I'm returning the Sonicare and I'm trying the Braun unit instead."
1,Starts to crack after 4 days of use,"I can't believe this! The handle is cracking in 4 places and I've only had it a week! It works great, but I'm astonished that no one tested this plastic under the conditions that someone would actually used it. I am VERY disappointed. I have talked to others and gues what! Cracks started forming on their 100 dolloar toothbrushes also! At this price, this appliance should be a lot more strudy."
1,BLACK MOLD,This brush may be great...but it won't last long...Like other reviewers I got the BLACK MOLD....it is disgusting. I guess the problem is that the water gets into all the places and cracks in the frame. This cannot be healthy. It is the black mold like all the homeowners got in their homes and ended up having to move away. Not a good thing on a toothbrush. While it doesn't touch your mouth...I don't think you want that stuff near you...much less your face.
5,so handy,These are awesome! Sturdy and functional as well as space-saving. I keep a pair in my kitchen and use them all the time for all sorts of things (used them to open the plastic ring on a carton of milk this morning).
3,surprise,"If you don't like to see guns pop up unexpectedly in children's books then don't buy this one. I was thoroughly disappointed to see a gun come into play towards the end of what was, until that point, a nice story."
3,Gets the job done!,"First off, Mad Catz does not make long lasting controllers. However, as a back up controller (one used only when a friend plays with you) Mad Catz is more than effective! Assuming you only play with it periodically it should last a good while. The Microcon style makes it feel smaller and more like Nintendo's Gamecube design. A good buy if you need a controller on the quick."
4,Great mask,"This mask is a pleasure to wear. It is much lighter than my old single bar mask. I have taken a few good shots both glancing and straight on, no indications that the mask is damaged in any way."
1,No tiene voz para la salsa.,"Sherly Bruce no tiene voz para interpretar el ritmo tropical de la salsa. La musica y los arreglos de este disco son muy buenos ya que tiene un estilo parecido a El Gran Combo e Ismael Rivera, pero solo la musica de este disco es buena ya que la voz de la cantante no es la mejor. Creo que Sherly Bruce tiene un estilo para cantar musin pop en ingles pero no para la salsa."
4,weird movie wonder,This movie is really weird and good but its not worth the 30.00 or so dollars they want for it. go rent it!
1,"Nice idea, terrible design","This is a beautiful cage, and it gives my two guinea pigs plenty of room to run. There is a huge design flaw, however. Someone didn't realize that small animals like to go the bathroom in corners and along the edges of their cage, so when they go, urine runs through to the floor because the drip pan doesn't extend to the edges. I have to keep puppy housetraining pads under the cage so the carpet doesn't get soiled. I would not spend almost $100 on this cage again. Having a solid-bottomed cage is a lot more work to clean, but at least your animals won't be relieving themselves all over the floor."
5,Great quality!,"The cage is sturdy, high quality and looks great. I love that I can wheel my bunny around to be with us. I was worried that she might not like being up high, but she seems to love her new cage. I would highly recommend this cage for your bunny. I encountered the same problem as others, the plastic pan came broken. Amazon shipped a new cage which arrived in less than a week."
4,I like it,"I ordered this same cage a little while back and had to return it because the tub was cracked. There were no problems with the return. Very simple. I was a little hesitant to order it again because I didn't want to have to send it back. The second one came in just fine, and completely intact. I was able to put it together very quickly and easily, and without directions. (There weren't any in the box.) My rabbit loves it! She isn't very big, but she loves the extra room. My students enjoy it because they can see her easily and we can wheel her to different parts of the classroom for a change of scenery. :)"
4,"After ""The Playoffs"" it's clear who the winner is!","I'm thoroughly pleased with this CD, the versatility shown in songs about Jonzin' and Drunk Words....Sober Thoughts, to the reflective but non-preaching, Die 2 Make A Livin definately show that DMS's second release is anything but Sophomoric. By the time that the lyrically gifted ""D Ale D"" and very much underrated ""Reef"" start flexing on Red Beans & Rice, you can give up any hope of not listening to the entire CD. Keep It Movin and the touching My World Too by Moe-B keep you hooked until the CD winds down and you undoubtedly activate your ""repeat CD"" feature."
3,"Good G-Funkish production, but lack of original lyrics","If you like the laid back sound of Seatown groups like Crooked Path and Major Weight Media, you'll no doubt like these fellas. They keep it simple: G-funkish beats with that Seattle twist, and laid back playalistic flows. It's nothing too original as far as lyrics go, but if you're looking for something to bump in your ride, this is the right stuff."
3,Nath,This Item is Ok. Pellow covers are not same as that are shown in the Photo. It Ok for the Dollars your Spend don't get carried by the look of the item
4,"A good, meaningful short story","Having to read and compare Young Goodman Brown to The Crucible as a school assignment first seemed like a chore at first. But after understanding the story and being able to analyze it, it really is a great story although somewhat confusing in the beginning. If you'd like a little backround, Young Goodman Brown is about a Puritan man who takes a walk into the woods and finds himself talking to the devil."
2,A Predictable Bore..,"Sorry to be the bad review... But I was surprised how much this book bored me. I have read quite a few of their books in the past and have found them to be exciting and engaging and hard to put down. However, this book lead me to wonder whether or not I should even finish it. The only reason I kept reading it was because I convinced myself it would get more exciting. It didn't.If you are ""medically inclined"", I can see it being more engaging, as you will actually understand more of it. Half the time, I was skipping ahead to get past the ""medical language"".The characters were likeable and the writing was good. But the plot just bored me."
3,"Not one of her best, but it's nice to revisit old friends","Mary Balogh's always had a way with romance, and she sure knows how to touch a reader's heart. This, though, is definitely not one of her best novels--in fact, I felt a little disappointed when I finally closed the book. It's not up to her usual standards, and it seemed a little like she had finally run out of steam. Unfortunately for me, I've looked forward to this story ever since Balogh first made mention of the raffish Earl of Haverford (I think it was in _Indiscreet_, which is by far a better novel--it's about the Viscount and Viscountess Rawleigh, who are mentioned in _Unforgiven_). Still, it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, and if you're a big fan of Balogh, or even if you're just starting out, this is an enjoyable read."
5,A POWERFUL TOUCHING NOVEL!,THIS NOVEL IS A VERY TOUCHING NOVEL OF TWO LOST LOVES! MARY BALOGH IS A VERY EXCEPTIONAL AND EXCELLENT AUTHOR BRINGING HER CHARACTERS TO LIFE. A WONDERFUL PLOT TO BRING BACK THE TWO LOVERS TO DEAL WITH EACH OTHER AGAIN!
2,2 stars for a traditional but flawed Balogh,"This is not one of Mary Balogh's better romances. I admit I have a problem with Mary Balogh's longer fiction. I find she crams an awful lot of plot twists & turns into her ""Super"" regencies, and in some of her longer novels...in place of character development, there's alot of dialog & plot weakness. There was just too much going on here, the romantic element & sexual tension (which Balogh can write so well in her shorter fiction) got overwhelmed. There was nothing particularly memorable about this hero or heroine; frankly, they seemed pretty blah. The reason they initially got separated seemed weak, and the reason they finally got together seemed weaker. So what if the hero cried when the heroine miscarried? I didn't feel anything for him, I just didn't care. This was kind of a ""by the numbers"" Balogh, with all her signature bits, but no heart."
4,this is a great book,"This is one of the best crime books I have read in awhile. I saw the movie years ago and had no idea it was a book until I saw it for sale in a cafe for a buck. While the movie sticks to the bank heist, the book takes you into the world of guys who engage in homosexual acts but don't consider themselves gay. They are just 'checking things out.' Littlejoe, the main character, is a fascinating figure. He starts off sleazy and manipulating but in the end turns out to be the most decent person in the story. This book has a lot of good insights as well. I am surprised it doesn't have more reviews."
1,BE CAREFUL,Even though it said 12 0nly 1 arrives. RIP OFF Do not order unless you want 1. Tiny No good for nothing but the trash
1,NOT the same Quantity of 12pc as Advertised,"I am Very UNHAPPY with what I received. I ordered the ""Bulk 12"" and Expected to receive TWELVE tire gauges BUT... only received ONE!I consider this particular item to be FALSE ADVERTISING.I would have rated this a ZERO if that option was provided so instead am forced to rate it as a One..."
1,Not a bulk pack,"The title is misleading, you only get one gauge, not twelve, as described. Other than that, the gauge looks fine."
2,misleading,"While this DVD is a reasonable record of the life of Cleopatra, the ending is completely misleading.The main authority for the life of Claeopatra is the Roman author Plutarch, writng more than a century later. At the end of this chapter Plutarch is quite clear that the death of cleopatra by almost painless snakebite was only the gossip in Rome at the time and that he personally didn't believe the story.There is no definite information about the end of Cleopatra but the snakebite story seems to have been concocted by the Octavian political party to compare the behaviour of the ""foreign queen"" to the ""honest"" Roman Mark Anthony who had thrown himself on his own sword and suffered a painful death."
5,Leaping Lizards,"Leaping Lizards! This is a fun story. It's not easy to write a tale with a lizard as the narrator, but Ms. Kelly pulls it off. Children will learn that seemingly insurmountable fears can be overcome. And it's a darn, cute story too."
5,A source book for great design and typography,"25 years of U&lc. If you have a big messy pile of old issues of this legendary design magazine, you might consider adding this compact (but not particulary small) book to your quick-reference library. If you don't have a print run of U&lc, what are you waiting for?"
2,Not very Fletch-like,"Taking place in Brazil, this book tends to lose the story among descriptions of Carnival parades and drums and songs. It is extremely slow, seeming more like a day in the life of Fletch on vacation. No real mystery or adventure here, nothing Fletch couldn't pack up and leave behind, unlike most of the other Fletch books. Not too much of the classic Fletch dialogue, but there is plenty of portugese without translation and names that are tough to pronounce. Clearly, Gregory MacDonald did his homework for this book, but it I could use a little less description and a little more story. I will, of course, still read the two Fletch books that I have yet to read."
2,Not Good,"This is my first Fletch book, and it might be my last. I'm only half way through it, but I'm not even sure I'll finish it. Essentially, the problem boils down to there not being any Fletch in the book. Though he's physically present, he doesn't seem to do, say, or think anything. Most of the book consists of McDonald going on and on and on about Brazil and the Brazilians. Fletch just sits in the middle of it and observses their zany, wackiness (as if anyone cares). Theoretically, there's a murder mystery here, but no one, especially not Fletch, does anything to investigate. Looking at the other reviews here, it appears it's not just me who thinks this. So, I'd say don't bother reading this."
2,Worst of the series,"It's almost as if someone else wrote the book. It doesn't have the feel of any of the other Fletch books and I was thoroughly disappointed. Obviously, the author wrote it after a trip to Rio, probably during Carnivale, and he was affected by it so much that he wrote the lead character so much differently from the other Fletch books. He doesn't speak the way he normally speaks, and frankly I almost bailed halfway through the book. Oh, and thanks for all of the Portugese which I don't speak. It just doesn't fit in the series. As a story, it certainly works and attempted to keep my interest, but as a Fletch book, sorry, I didn't care for it at all."
1,Fly Me Down to Rio,"Every prize winning author is entitled to a stinker. CARIOCA FLETCH by Gregory McDonald smells like the back allies of the Brazilian slums. The book does provide the reader with some back story as to what happen when the private plane landed with Fletch and a suitcase full of money as passengers.If you enjoy reading an entire series it is on the list.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
2,where's the mystery and fletch wit?,"cariocca fletch is probably one of the worst of the fletch books. certainly not ranking up there with the 2 of the best works of the whole mystery genre Fletch and Confess, Fletch. There is no real mystery or suspense here. Mcdonald delves into too much Brazilian mythology to create a plot. the mystery if you could call it one is who killed Janio Bareta 47 years ago? who cares. there is no real investigation into the murder, and fletch solves in about 2 seconds. the book could have been much shorter. i didn't find the characters very intersting. and i can't imagine that Brazilians are really this superstitious. most of the story is really about Brazil, and Carnival. the mystery if you could call it one, is really secondary to the setting. who cares. i can read losts of books about Brazil during Carnival without reading this one."
5,wow! that good pictures from dukes of hazzard,"what i look for i have one i love it because i love dukes of hazzard for long time so also i have dukes of hazzard poster, diecast cars of general lee, also model of daisy jeep, rosco police car and offical book and t shirts lot things at home i love lot of dukes hazzad county long time watch tv since 1978 when i was 3 year old. thanks!!!!!!!!"
4,Murder during the Silly Season,"Jed is running for the Hancock town council, and the whole Henshaw clan is stressed out. Susan is spending time trying to be the perfect political wife amid vicious items planted in the local media about Jed, and the total disintigration of the candidate for mayor's wife. The big issue is the Landmark Commission's mission to control every building in town built before 1939. The third party candidate for mayor, Ivan Deakin, announces that he has a solution for everything and will announce it at a press conference. Unfortunately, he drops dead at the podium before he can make his speech. All the candidates, their families, and the police chief's new girlfriend seem to be suspects.Wolzien seems to have captured the life of a candidate and his family very accurately in this novel. One is surprised that there aren't more murders during the election season. In any case, they wouldn't be as amusing as this one."
4,Elections Can Be Murder,"Tensions are running high in suburban Hancock, Connecticut as the local town elections approach. Series heroine Susan Henshaw finds herself right in the middle of the election excitement because her husband Jed is running for the Hancock city council. But when Ivan Deakin, one of the mayoral candidates, is poisoned right before giving a controversial speech, Susan dons her amateur sleuth role to help Hancock police chief Brett Fortesque solve Ivan's murder. Author Wolzien does a great job poking fun at the foibles of upper class Eastern suburbia. The mystery was a good one, too, that kept me guessing until the end."
1,Read it with caution,"Read it with cautionThis book contains a lot of information, some correct some incorrect, some useful some unlikely to interest the general reader. Do you really want to read a page-long list of Visigothic kings? Worse than this kind of information is the considerable number of errors,as a typical mistake, ""The Luciades"". This is supposed to be ""The Lusiads"" (see ""The Lusiads"", Oxford World's Classics, a five-star book). This traveller's history puts together a lot of material from different sources, but does so unselectively and without checking for accuracy. This is as bad as the Tyson-Ward Portuguese books!"
1,You can't call this a history!,"This is not really a history but mainly lists of events a large number of them presented in an unusual way and with the wrong date. Names are often spelt wrong, some beyond recognition. Others are quite amusing in their changed form, like Manrique (Manique). We the readers deserve better, much better. If you want a concise history of Portugal good for the traveller, then you have the right book in Portugal a Companion History by Jose Hermano Saraiva. That one is good!"
3,SHIPPING IS MORE THAN THE PATCH,"I would buy this in a second but the shipping is $3.00, more than the cost of the patch. I have shipped patches and it usually costs one or two stamps, ot $3."
1,This case sucks,I was surprised at the poor construction of this case. The holes drilled for screws to hold the hard drive bracket in place do not line up to the bracket itself. There are flimsy little plastic clips that broke of when I was inserting the HD. However the HD works. I am looking for a new case to enclose my HD.
4,"good quality, great price",I am very pleased with this watch. It's hard to find a dress watch that is also water resistant. This is both! A great look for an awesome price!
4,Memories,"I used to listen to these songs when I was a kid...I found this CD and all the songs are my favorites! Especially ""La Familia."" My new husband and I dedicated it to our families at our wedding this month. I cried!"
5,THE BEST IS YET TO COME...,"Pearl Bailey on Roulete Records... I have on record Pearl Bailey songbook albums which were released by Roulete... ALL STANDARD SONGS... Songbooks of Jimmy Van Heusen; Harold Arlen; Cole Porter; and more... Recorded in her prime in the 50's and 60's... This in my opinion was her best work... There's even an album of standards with her husband, the great jazz drummer, Louie Belson... So far all unavailable... It's a shame that she's being judged in our time on the basis of less than her best work... She was one of the best pop. and jazz song stylists... I believe those recordings are now owned by EMI... They really should be reissued..."
3,"Go Blue! Cool Game, cheap pieces","I'm a Wolverine, and I was so excited to FINALLY purchase Michiganopoly as I have always loved the classic Monopoly game. In terms of appearance, I was disappointed, and agree with other reviewers that the play pieces are cheap, as they're made out of plastic. Additionally, the credits are also hollow silver plastic cubes. One would think for the cost - you would have gotten metal playing pieces, and a bit better quality credits/diplomas.The game itself is a lot of fun. In the ruels, they tell you to put money under ""Spring Break"" (Free Parking) - which always makes for a fun game. I'm happy with the purchase, just wish the quality was better."
5,One of the Best i've ever heard!!!,"The Summerland Soundtrack is one of the best i've heard! It's got every kind of music! And even if you have never seen the show you'll love this cd! It has rock, indie, pop, and is very good to listen to! I hope you enjoy it as much as i do!!"
2,pathetic,i bought this album becuase i thought like the awesome songs they featured in the show was gonna be there...but all the good ones werent and all the ones that kinda suck are on there and i'm like whyyyyy....and the one with bradin and sara wasnt on there...wahhhhh
3,"Not as Good as I Hoped, But It's Not Bad","I like this CD, but the music isn't as good as what I'd hoped. Good for Summerland fans though."
4,why inspired by?!...,"this show is great and has so much good songs on each of it episodes,so why did they put songs inspired by the show?!...what's the use in that?!there is not a single song from season 1 to!...could have been better for me,love the CD though,but hope the only song inspired by is the one by jesse mccartney and the rest will be featuring on season 2!...anyhow,alive by kenny wayne shepherd doesn't siut the spirit of the show,it was better on the mountain where it was featuring at the begining...exept these things,you definatly need this CD to your collection for it great singers and groups."
4,Summerland-ness,"Even if you don't watch Summerland this soundtrack is more than worth picking up, if only for the All American Rejects ""My Paper Heart"" and New Found Glory's ""All Downhill From Here."" Jesse McCartney, one of the stars, proves he is multitalented with ""Get Your Shine On."" Buy this cd and immerse yourself in all it's Summerland-ness!"
4,Works great!!,"This product really does what it promises. Frequency of shaving did reduce once I started using this. Hair growth was slower and whatever hair grew was softer and lighter. I gave this only 4 stars because I didnt like the way it smelled. It didnt smell bad, but I wouldnt wear that scent if this were a perfume. Also, this moisturizer doesnt offer UV protection."
4,My fish approve!,"I feed these to my fish once in a while as a little treat, which of course they love. These come in rather large cubes, which for my 29 gallon is more than I need, so I need to break them by hand which is messy and not fun. They also float so my bottom-feeders don't get as much access to them, but that's par for the course I suppose. Overall, it's a great value through Amazon."
1,Waste of Money,"hi I have a community with a variety of fish, top, middle & bottom feeders. None of the fish prefer this brine shrimp, it actually clouds my tank. All the fish actually love the krill. If anybody wants to try any type of fish food, I would suggest them to get a sample from the LFS or from their friends, feed it to the fish, if they eat it then its worth to buy otherwise its a waste of money."
4,Recommend viewing,Well done. Somewhat depressing because of our age. Good example of upper middle class British social life in the 1920's.
5,Mrs. Dalloway,"Venessa Redgrave, as always, was delightful in this film. What a fantastic actress! The story was wonderful; so far removed from our society of today! I think it is a film well worth watching."
2,Mrs. Dalloway,"Vanessa Redgrave was excellent as expected, but the story line was not up to my expectations. I would not recommend this."
2,Should have listened to the negative reviews!!,"I was all set to love this movie, but as it turned out I couldn't wait for it to be over. I love to watch movies where they go back and look at their past, but this one was so disjointed. It kept going from past to present so often that you really couldn't enjoy watching either one. What I thought would be a love story from her past and them reunited and still in love in the present turned out to be completely different. I don't think she really loved either one of the men in her life all that much, what she was looking for was security, which made her an unsympathic to me. Also, I could have done without the crazy solider popping in and out of the movie. It just made it even more confusing."
2,disappointing,"Some reviewers enjoyed this film a great deal. I didn't. I hated the movie The Hours and I feel just about the same about this one. Vanessa Redgrave is an excellent actress and did a wonderful job as usual, but I thought the storyline was boring and slow. Expecting a lot more, I ended up disappointed."
1,Mrs. Dalloway,I normally love Vanessa Redgrave as an actress but this movie came up short. It was rather boring and lacked depth in the story. If I would have seen this movie before I certainly would not have purchased it.
5,The original version of The Hours,"If you are a fan of either the novel or film The Hours, then reading and watching Mrs. Dalloway is a must. The Hours was Virginia Woolf's original title for Mrs. Dalloway. Michael Cunningham cleverly took that title and turned into a novel that matches Mrs. Dalloway for its shear beauty. But this is a movie review and I can tell you that Vanessa Redgrave is brilliant in the title role. She should have been nominated for an Oscar at the very least. A day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, planning a party, remembering her life and loves. It's a lovely adaptation from Woolf's novel. And of course begins with ""Mrs. Dalloway decided she would buy the flowers herself."" Buy this yourself. You won't regret it."
2,Disjointed and Disappointing,"I usually love anything to do with England. About the only redeeming quality I found in the movie was the scenery in London and the countryside. Otherwise, the story was disjointed and disappointing with no real depth. Mrs. Dalloway spends a day remembering her youth, while being quite the air-head later in life. She speaks of no love, feels no regrets, appears shallow in character, and cares more about her parties than anything. Her loves and friends of the past haven't matured much either. The story was bland and slow, and I usually don't give two stars to anything. Except this one failed to move me, including the off-shoot of the poor man with shell-shock craziness after World War I - another disjointed part of the story."
4,Very Entertaining,"This is the 3rd or fourth book I've read by Pressfield. Last of the Amazons is yet another novel that manages to pull the reader in with its combination of the historically accurate, the historically possible, and the mythological. If you enjoy novels wherein the lines of the three become blurred to the point that one can hardly be discerned from the other all while taking the reader on a great ride you will not be disappointed."
2,"Good battle scenes, missing character connection & development","Pressfield does an excellent job of describing battle scenes and a decent job of creating the culture of the Amazons and the Greeks.However, what breaks the story is that it is told from several points of view - none of which have voice changes. The ""voice"" of each ""narrator"" is basically the same. The voice of a middle aged Greek warrior and the voice of his niece (either as an old woman or as a young girl) would be different, just as the voice of Selene would be. If the author hadn't noted who was telling what part of the story, you would never have guessed that it was a different person. I don't think this leads to strong character development and I couldn't quite get myself to care, on any level, about the characters. The over all impression was a flat one - a finely tuned world with characters that can't quite connect with the reader."
4,Loved it,"bought this book after i read Gates of Fire, another Steven Press book. And i wish they made a movie kind of like 300, but with boobs & gore:) by the goddesses it would be epiclly sexy!"
2,Not the worst book around,I honestly don't believe this is a piece of rubbish. Not at all. Well... maybe.
1,"Uggh, what's that smell? Oh, it's this book","This terrible novel emphasizes all the terrible elements of Gates of Fire. Flat, cartoonish characters and stilted writing style. Stunningly bad."
2,Very Difficult to Follow,"In all fairness, I was unable to finish this novel, but I gave it my best shot. Twice. Pressfield has a writing style that is difficult for me to follow. I thought it backwards. The prose is also too wordy. A prime example is this sentence: ""Now from the latter's throat arose such a cry as may never from memory's vault be eradicated."" I think that could be way simplified. There were also strange religious disrepencies like on page 45 a man declares ""Father Almighty, spare me for my bride and babe!"" and also ""By God, the storm had struck fast!"" This novel occurs in a time before a single entity existed. As a matter of fact, just one chapter before, the people are sacrificing a ram to Persephone and a bull to Poseidon. I feel this was a terrific story and plot, but needs a different style."
2,pseudo,"While packed with fun historic detail, unusual words and dramatic gore, ultimately this book is overcome by its excessive shifts in point of view, unappealing protagonists and drastic overuse of pseudo-archaic language."
4,great for all types of fish,I used this to feed to my guppy fry. Great to help them grow quick and produce color. Aftewrwards I fed to my other tropical fish as a treat they love it! They get crazy and produce vivid colors!
1,Redundant with Dramatic Writing,"Published after The Art of Dramatic Writing, this one is a suprisingly vague, wishy-washy rehash of the same material. Art of *Dramatic* Writing is excellent--buy that instead."
2,Shakespeare's boy? NOT!!!! A disappointing book!,"Anyone wanting to romantic, tender tale of boylove and innocence lost in Shakespeare's time will be disappointed by this book. The main character is totally unbelievable, and worse, unlikable. He's basically got world view of a 20-something bar fly. His language is so foul so often, that it becomes boring. But worse to me, was the slang is so contempary, that any feeling of being in West Hollywood or Castro instead of Shakespeare's England. Great Marlow is a fat, unwashed pervert, and Will is vague and undefined. Of course, some gay men really think like this that this stuff is very gay chic and cutting edge, and might find the book amusing, so I'll give 2 stars. But to an adult with a life and education, and actual positive experiences in my gay life, this book was a waste of time and money."
5,"Fantastic Story, Superb message","These books are fantastic! As a mother with a child who has significant learning difficulties, these books have been my saving grace. It was a fight every night to get my son to read. He could never relate to any of the stories; most at his reading level are too babyish and those that aren't were too hard for him to follow. These books are perfect becuase they are fun. He can relate to Hank and therefore has fun following the story. I wish that I could thank Mr. Winkler for this wonderful character. My son can see that just because you have a hard time learning does not mean that you are not smart and funny and able to have friends. What a wonderful life lesson! I had given up hope that my son would enjoy reading. He has even discussed the books with us after he is done reading, something he had never done before. I highly recommend these books for all kids. The stories are well written and funny. Hank has many great adventures and all have a great lesson to pass on."
2,"Considering the price, this is a terrible value and scent","I originally got this at 15, when it was trendy, but now 9 years later, I laugh at how juvenile it is. The scent has a paralyzing citrus/seaweed quality (it's too overwhelming, lacks nuance and basenotes)and the scent really does stick to whatever it touches. A high quality cologne develops over time, on your skin and once it has left the bottle, this clearly isn't high quality. There are many colognes that are far better for approximately the same price.The one nice thing about this item is the cool looking bottle, but what good will that really do you?"
1,leaking even during a light raing,"I had a small Eureka tent for about 10 years and it was great. Just weeks ago I bought the Tetragon 1210 and went for a camping trip. It was leaking water even during light rain. Probably through a place where the zippers meet in a corner. I wrote to Eureka, but got no response. When I called the customer service, the were not really friendly ant told me, that even when I had the tent for 2 weeks, the zippers are not covered through the warranty and I have to pay for their replacement, which will take several weeks. Surprisingly the person did not realy care,'that their tent with advertised storm shield is leaking."
4,Great Family Tent,"This is a great family tent! We had two adults, one toddler and one infant (in a Pack'n'Play) in this tent - and still had room for all of our stuff. LOTS of ventilation, which is great for warmer weather. We did seal the tent - and had no leaks during a huge storm. It's nice being able to stand up in the center - and the kids love all of the room!The only complaint is that the zippers are a bit tough to operate as there is an extra flap on the zipper to keep out the water/rain. We were able to get past it, but it's the only reason I didn't give this a 5 out of 5."
3,"It's the rods, stupid!","I am generally pleased with the roominess of the tent, but I'm very disappointed with the durability of the heavy rods that support it. The instructions say that the tent is more difficult for one person to assemble, and this is definitely true. It forces the major support rods to bend too much, and so far I have split two sections. Other problems with the rods are 1)the inner cord holding the sections together is too weak,so the rods keep separating as you try to slide them through the sleeves; 2. the aluminum sleeves holding the rod sections together are on the outside, so they are constantly snagging on the sleeves as you try to slide them through. Between coming apart and snagging, I have to spend a lot of time just getting the rods in position. Finally, the fly is poorly designed, and I woke up with rain in my face the first time I camped. However, last weekend I spent 3 days in pouring rain and fog, and the tent, once assembled, performed very well."
4,Light Recreational Family Use Tent,We used this tent for the first time and because I don't know much about tents I asked my husband what he liked and didn't like. He liked that it was large enough to fit 6 people comfortably. It was easy to set up. He didn't like the material used at the bottom of the tent - he said it was too flimsy. Overall he was happy with the tent and the fact that we got it for around $95 (it looks like the price has gone up).
4,Good tent,"This is our second new ""family"" tent in 15 years. I'm not sure how you could put it up with one person as some reviews state, it took two adults and two kids ""helping"" to go up easily even after a practice session. We had no inclement weather to test the water resistance. My only negative comment is about the zipper size: The pulls are small as are the zipper teeth, smaller than my old tent. And it does take two hands to operate the door zipper to keep the fabric from getting caught in the zipper. Not good when you have a bunch of stuff in your hands to go inside.It for sure can only hold 4 people with gear. The room divider does get in the way for family camping. The hanging gear loft also gets in the way of standing. It cuts the headroom down to about 5'. But I think it will do just fine for our casual use camping."
3,"Ok, but not for the rain","I won't buy a tent again that doesn't have a fly that goes all the way to the ground on all sides. Rain hits the exposed areas of the main tent and eventually dampness gets in. You don't want to have dry clothes touching the sides (inside) of this tent in the rain. The floor of the tent is too thin, a good ground sheet is a must."
4,Great tent at a great price,"Exactly what I was looking for, at the best price that I found. It shipped promptly and arrived in great shape."
1,Don't buy! Not the Eureka of old.,"The short story: Poorly designed and executed. Not up to the quality standards that Eureka maintained in years past.The longer story: This tent is made of very light-weight material. That would be understandable if it were a backpacking tent. It isn't. Here's what went wrong in the two weeks I had this tent before I sent it back:1. The gear loft could not be used because one of the tie points was missing.2. The shock cord pulled through the ferrule on the end of one of the poles.3. In what I would estimate to be a 20 to 25 MPH wind, the fly disintegrated.I had a Eureka backpacking tent (the Caddis, for those of you ""experienced"" enough to remember) That I used often for 15 years before passing it on to a friend in worn, but usable condition when I bought a lighter tent. The Tetragon is nothing like that. It is poorly designed, made of cheap materials, included many errors in manufacture. A complete waste of time and money."
5,Everything I hoped it would be and more...,"We are going on our first camping trip this weekend so I haven't really slept in it yet. However, we pitched it in the backyard for a test run. It was easy to assemble and took us about 30 minutes the first time around. I had no idea that there was a front and back door on this tent. Other tents I have had in the past only had one entrance. I thought this was a great feature. We had it up all day and over night. We had a very heavy rainstorm the afternoon we put it up and only a few drops entered the tent near the windows. I was fairly shocked that it was this waterproof! Of course this was with the rain fly on. Also, my husband is 6 foot tall and he can stand up in the tent which was one of my main criteria for purchasing the right tent for our family. I am very excited about our first camping trip this weekend with my husband, 2 year old son, and dog."
1,No Dimensions!,This company doesn't provide dimensions of its products. Won't buy a product without dimensions. This is important if you need to know if the case can fit into a cabinet.
4,different customers seem to get different heights,"Based on the other reviews and reponses, the exact dimensions of these units must vary from time to time, in the different batches they manufacture. One reviewer said they are 17 inches high, and someone in a response to another review said 19 1/2. The three units I received in Dec 2012 are 17 3/4 inches high. I was expecting 17 even, from that other review, so I had to re-arrange my cabinet shelves. The units are fine for what they are and serve their purpose just as expected, even though the price does seem high for a piece of molded plastic. All in all I'm satisfied with the purchase."
2,Flimsy,"I ordered two of these items. I expected they would be more sturdy than what they turned out to be.One of the two items was broken (the brace across the back of the unit). I returned the unit for a refund, which was easy to do.I would not buy this product again.On the plus side, it does hold DVD well."
3,A good Halloween story in colonial times,"Although kids may be a little puzzled and bored by this tale of All Hallow's Eve, it will still scare them and keep them interested enough to want to read it until the end. A good historical fiction book for younger kids."
2,Beginners book,This book is possibly useful for the total novice of reporting. Spending a lot of pages explaining how to install the application and making the most basic reports makes it unnecessarily long. A lot if screenshots makes the book even longer so you can wonder if the author was payed by the page. The price seems hard to justify.
2,Another disappointing job search book,"I have long been hoping to find the ONE career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that I want out of life. I'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money.This book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for FREE. It then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect. If this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you.Most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a VERY BASIC level.Save your money and speak with a career counsler."
5,Solid Kitchen Knives,"As a sort of a knife enthusiast, I bought these knives as a gift for my mother. They were inexpensive, they work very well, and she loves them. They were razor sharp when she got them and still are. Some have complained that the handle quality is low...but you should have known what to expect when looking at the image or reading the description (polypropylene). Sure the handles could be better (they aren't bad), but as paring knives, these really aren't the knives you should have out on the table and they are highly functional. For my mother's general use around the kitchen and specifically for paring, this is a great set of knives."
2,Very cheap handles,"The knives are sharp (they should be as they are new), but the plastic handles feel so cheap. I'm almost embarrassed to have them in my kitchen. I'm very surprised it uniformly received 5 stars from all of the other respondents."
2,The resources aren't worth the slanted viewpoint,"I keep looking for a good, down and dirty resource specifically for fantasy fiction, one that doesn't wrap it in with science fiction as an afterthought. Fantasy fiction, while speculative, is also its own genre and has its own archetypes and standards that stand alone, without the crutch of science fiction. The problem with LeFanu's book is that she leans on some archetypes while dismissing others. Any attempt of this sort leads to a narrowing of the genre. Being revolutionary and liberated from all past stereotypes is no more valid a stance than writing something fresh within old and standard archetypes. I was unimpressed with her one-sided viewpoint and sweeping judgements. The moment you say, ""You shouldn't do it this way or that way,"" someone will come along and knock you off your high horse, and I daresay that authors come along every year to prove Sarah LeFanu wrong."
1,Not as great as others with more features for less money,"This is an OK stroller, but it's not all that great. There are others that are better for less money. There is no basket underneath to put your diaper bag or purse. The sun canopy is very small and not at all effective. There is no snack tray for either child or parent. For less money, get the Safety First Avila lightweight stroller. It has a roomy basket, useful sun shade, and 2 snack trays...and it is just as lightweight as the Caddy, all for $10 less!"
4,Happy Flyer,Great stroller for all types of travel. It comes with a handy bag so that when it gets thrown around in the aircraft it stays clean. I love that it has a 5 point harness rather than the graco city light which only has a lap belt. Very light and easy to collapse.
3,NOT for tall people,"Great looking and comfortable for baby, but the handles are so short without extentions and the wheel base is close together, which makes it hared to push for those taller people (I'm 5'10""). I'm always slouching or kicking the wheels!"
4,Very functional,"Overall, we're fairly pleased with the stroller. The handles are a good height, and I love the carry basket under the stroller. It is very easy to steer and move around. The sunshade is a bonus that a lot of smaller strollers don't have, but this one is a little flimsy and a little small for blocking a lot of sun. Our biggest complaint is with the buckles on the harness. We like that the harness comes over the shoulders to provide more security for our daughter, but they are really hard to fasten and unfasten. I just started leaving the shoulder straps fastened and put her arms through them like a jacket. Then I fasten that part to the buckle that comes up between her legs. Much easier!"
4,quick and easy,"We have 4 boys, with each of them tried a new and improved umbrella or convience stroller. We did find one that we loved but it doesn't have the 5 point harness , and with this baby we really NEED that , he's a climber. The belts keep him safely seated and it's a breeze to put him in . I have taken it out of the car with the baby in one arm , opened it , locked it and buckled him in , in about 1 minute . It has almost all the features of the old convience stroller,,,, the sun shade, the basket, nice height for mom and dad....the only thing we miss is a cup holder for us, but we have used the zip pouches on the side to hold water bottles. The recline is so-so , not quite a full sleeping position . I'd have to recomend this to anyone with a climber !"
4,Good for summer use,"I like this product, but it is too low for my husband to use. Other than that it is really good deal."
1,Safety issue,"I have had my stroller for about 3 months. I only use it occassionally. In the few times that I have used it, the stroller has collapsed with the baby in it at least 3 times. It happened two times this week alone. I am writing this to warn others. I will not be using this anymore. There are two locking bars on this stroller, but it is so flimsy that it pops up on it's own. My baby is a year old, and weighs approximately 24 lbs. so I can't say it is because she is too heavy for this. Maybe it is a defect in my stroller, but I just thought people should know before a bad accident happens."
5,Love this stroller!,"I would recommend this stroller to anyone. It is definitely worth the extra money for a umbrella stroller. It comes with a carrying bag, and rain cover. It is so sturdy, compact, and lightweight. It will last much longer than the cheaper umbrella stroller, worth the money!"
4,Not made in Italy,"I just got this stroller so can't really rate it yet, but it is NOT made in Italy, it's made in China and plainly says so on the box. Otherwise, it seems like a good stroller so far."
3,This blanket is ok,This blanket is ok but my baby uses it more as a toy than to teethe. I do not like all the synthetic materials used to make this but it is cute. My baby is enjoying playing with it. It makes a good toy for the baby.
3,"Well made, but may not be liked or used by all babies","Not too expensive product that one could dish out the $10 or so on to try with their baby. This product is well made and has good features including the pacifier attachment. My son uses the teethers from time to time, but it is kind of big to fit into his mouth. He uses other teethers much more. Big plus is that it is machine washable."
3,Cute and colorful,My toddler did like to play with this when he was a baby but he never used it as a teether really. He'd chew on it but not the teether parts. It is a cute little gift but I'm not sure how much they'll really play with it.
2,Not what you think,The product you purchase is not the item shown in the picture. The product is nice all the same. But I like to receive what I think I am getting.
4,Little guy loves this!,"I'd give this five stars, except that my son is not really into the teething corners (but perhaps not YET--he is 4.5 months old). What I love about it is that its machine washable (I put it in the dryer, too, though I don't know if the manufacturer recommends this). He's has this for a month, and it's easy for him to get into his mouth, even without a great deal of control! Highly recommend--we have two, because one is always in the wash."
4,Fine,"As described, but smaller than I expected. The pacifier loop won't stay on my baby's pacifier, so I just took it off."
2,Good idea but needs improvment,"I was looking for something that my baby could hold and snuggle and I could attach my own paci of choice to, this seemed to be a great idea however the product itself is lacking. The pacifier attachment is difficult, you can't easily remove the paci to clean, I'm actually afraid I'd break the elastic if I tried it again. I also liked the idea of a silky side but it looks terrible. I washed it on gentle and let it air dry before giving it to my baby and all the silk starting unraveling then so I trimmed those threads. After my baby has grabbed at it for a day its all snagged. I give it two stars bc its a great idea but the materials used are so poor I doubt it will last more than a week more."
2,ONE BOTTLE,"Note, the color is beautiful. But the description is deceptive. You are not getting ALL FIVE BOTTLEs. You are getting ONLY ONE! And it's not returnable!"
5,Good stuff lifetime warranty!,Same wrenches sold by Sears and have a lifetime warranty. Wrenches are nice and tight.
1,5 minites of HELL!!!!!!,ok were should i should i start. first of all its ugly as hell. second the triggers are way to sensetive. and third its cheaply made i mean come on at leazst the regular xbox 360 controler has nice hard buttons these ones are cheap plastic. ooo and dont get me started on the bumpers which are extremly loud when u push them. the only good thing about it is that its 15$ cheeper then the regular xboxs controlar but i dont sugest it. u should buy microsoft licenced stuff only. i give this controler a 1 out of 1000000000000. ps. i said 5 miniets of hell cause thats how long it took for me to get angry enough to throw it out the window trust me DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!
4,LOTS of cowboy westerns,"Well it promises a 150 hours of westerns and it definetly delivers on that. Some of the shows are kind of grainy but watchable. I had forgotton that the Cisco Kid was color. I had never seen he Gabby Hayes show, so, in other words you have lots of stuff to watch when there is nothing on the other 200 channels you own!!"
4,Old Western movies,Good group of Weatern movies. OK quality picture and sound. I really enjoy Western movies and this is a good package but would have liked to of had more of the more popular stars.
3,slightly unhappy,the quality on a large tv is not good but is ok on a small 10 inch portable dvd player a few are ok on larger screens.
4,There's (a little) gold in them thar' hills!,"You won't find TV's best western shows here--no Gunsmoke, Rawhide, Have Gun Will Travel or Wanted Dead or Alive, but there's plenty of watchable stuff.Bonanza holds up very well after 40 years, as does Wagon Train and Death Valley Days. I never heard of many of the shows here, like Northwest Passage, Hudson's Bay, or Cowboy G-Men. The writing and acting are pretty crude in some of them, obviously geared toward kids.Still, if you're a diehard western fan like I am, you'll enjoy most of the shows in this collection. When the snow's blowin' outside and the TV networks are serving up their usual crappy reality shows, this box of DVDs will be worth its weight in gold!"
3,Enjoying.. however,"My husband is enjoying the westerns. However I'm finding a lot of things bad. Sometimes it looks like they filmed it off of a tv. Sometimes the sound has to be turned full bore and still hard to hear. Some act like they were edited incorrectly as they buzz and screech. Yes, I could quickly watch them all and send back the ones not working.. but I've decided to just let him enjoy and not worry too much unless they get worse."
3,tv westerns,"this set surprised me.i've bought these dvd theme sets that have a million movies for $20,and they've all disappointed me.this set gives the classic tv western fan quite a few shows that are actually good(the rifleman,cisco kid,bonanza,and a few more).over all,the collection is pretty good,and i do recommend this set for purchase."
4,Gave as gift to my Dad,So I gave this to my Dad as a gift for his Birthday. He loved it. He called to tell me that he was enjoying every episode and that it was hard not to watch one right after the other.
2,too childish,"i got this for a member of my family who loves westerns. and he couldnt even finish the first one,cause he said it was too childish. so unless you are buying this for a kid dont get it.because you wont get the classic gun vs. gun. man vs. man western you were looking for."
5,Ultimate TV Westerns - 150 Episodes,Ultimate TV Westerns - 150 EpisodesI enjoyed watching these great old TV Westerns.
3,A good laugh,"You can do your own Mystery Theater 3000, but for westerns with these. Can't believe I lived for these as a kid. Put some on once in a while and wonder at the innocence of our youth. Good for the classic gun lovers too."
2,Ultimate TV Westerns 15Episodes,"I have now received my copy of the Ultimate TV Westerns. I have given this 2 stars as it served the purpose I ordered it for, that was to check out so many of the old westerns to help me make up my mind as to which I would go on to order. Some I could not remember all that well and this helped to jog my memory. As I said the picture quality was not so good and had some faults but as I said this was a cheap way to check out so many series. I for one do like these multiple artist discs except for the reasons I have given."
4,Excellent Introduction to the Megilloth,"Soncino's commentary on the megilloth (Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther) includes introductory essays by Rabbis Cohen and Rosenberg, the Hebrew text with English translation on the facing page, and a digest of commentaries below the translation. Further midrashic commentaries are appended at the end of each bookThe commentaries present a wide range of rabbinic views of the megilloth, and are drawn from dozens of sources, from Talmudic times through the late Middle Ages. They present the reader with a respresentative cross-section of traditional Jewish thought on the subjects raised in each scroll. Consquently, this work serves as an excellent introduction the megilloth and their place in the Jewish Canon."
4,animalistic,"Excellent Animals-longer versions and different versions from the U.S. L.P'S. One disappointment was those U.S. versions were not included. I give credit to them because in the notes, they apologized for this exclusion. Must be about the songs rights of U.S. and English companies. Unfortunately it is not complete."
4,Nice looking but flawed.,"Very attractive, well built novelty bird feeder with one flaw. When it rains, the bowl fills with water. A drainage hole is needed."
3,Pretty good,"Pretty good light weight inexpensive conditioner. Not good for heavier treatments when you add aloe vera and honey...it gets these odd white things, although it didn't used to so perhaps there was a formula changes in recent years. Good smell that isn't overpowering."
2,Good,"This book was in pretty bad shape but I use very often. I just don't know which will fall apart first,me or the book."
5,Love this sling,We have a moby and it was getting too hot to wear it in the summer so I bought this sling and LOVE it! Super easy to put on and great to nurse in. I have been telling all my baby wearing friends about this sling!
2,FADED,so supposedly this item is new but the one i recieved looked very used. very dissappointed not the dark pretty purple color like in the picture. don't buy for a gift like i did.
2,Nelson Books paperback version is small,"I was disappointed in the nelson books paperback version of this book. It is only 5 1/4 by 5 1/4 inches. That amount of page space does not give much room to respond to the questions and truly write a life story. My husband has an 8 1/2 by 5 1/4 size book which he has really enjoyed writing in and I had purchased these to give to our sons. I will find the regular book size for them, these are too small."
2,This is not for every father!,"This book has a great idea. It's kind of like a journal into the mind of the father through his own words. I know that I sometimes have a hard time telling about myself and this book would help do that. HOWEVER, I do NOT recommend this book to anyone other than a Christian. I am a Deist and was a little upset to find it asking questions like ""When did you become a Christian? How did your life change?"" The other things are much better. For example: ""Recall for me five of the most important lessons you have learned in life."" THAT'S something profound and perfect to teach your children no matter who you are. All in all this isn't a bad book. It's has great stuff, but it has a lot of questions that non-Christians just aren't going to be interested in or will be disappointed with. Ultimately I think this would be fantastic if they kept this one, but also did others for non-theists and non-Christians."
2,Disappointing compared to the older version,"I had bought the previous version for my father but it got misplaced. I ordered this one as a replacement. In the older version, questions about my mom were referenced as ""mom."" For example ""Where did you meet mom?"" In the new version, ""mom"" is instead referenced as ""your wife."" For example, ""Where did you meet your wife?"" I found the new language creepy and kind of repulsive. Even if my parents were divorced (they're not) I'd be interested in the person who gave birth to me, not his current wife. Hopefully I'll be able to track down an earlier copy of the book. The concept of this book is wonderful, but the execution of this version isn't."
4,Wonderful gift,"I have not used this yet; however, it is a wonderful book & a wonderful idea. This is great for promoting relationships, particularly for young people and their elderly relatives (grandpa is the relative in my case). In doing this, I anticipate my son and daughter (who will take turns asking the questions) will learn a lot about their grandpa and find some common ground which is not always evident between generations. Absolutely stellar idea. Such a wonderful keepsake."
1,Poor!,"I agree with most of what the other reviewer has to say, but I have one major difference of opinion. The casting of this production is awful. There are some good voices, Gens in particular, but no one seems quite right. The Zerlina and Masetto are both swallowed up and leave a lot to be desired in terms of acting. The Ottavio is awful, and the commendatore took his time finding the beat. The only performers worth seeing are the Donna Elvira and Don Giovanni, both are fine, but not special and the people I haven't mentioned are utterly forgetable.I don't have a problem with Modern productions, in fact, at times I perfer them, but this doesn't work and isn't worth the disc it's burned onto. If you want a modern Don, get the Salzburg with Hampson and D'arcangelo, or the new release with Keenlyside. There are some awesome traditional Don dvd's like the Met's with Terfel. Steer clear of this unless you are collector, and if you are a collector make sure you have every other version before this one."
3,Will Rogers and his time,"Will Rogers is an American legend whose perspective on life, politics and entertainment continues to delight and inspire more than 75 years after his death. The scope of his biography by Richard Ketchum surprised me with highlights and embarrassments of a key era in US and world politics, as well as Will's personal tale. It is also a history of a unique period in US entertainment that loved Will (from radio and vaudeville to wild west shows and the developing motion picture industry). The book is packed with interesting information but rarely bogs down, balancing precious Rogers quotes with historic details."
1,Not worth buying,"This rug has a very thin weave and looks cheap. Also the ""white"" background in the photo is more of a dirty off-white color."
5,A sea dream,"tone poem in the same spirit as Martin Denny's _Enchanted Sea_ and Les Baxter's _Jewels of the Sea_, but even more relaxing than those great records. This will transport you to a late afternoon at a quiet beach somewhere.. circa 1956... Look at the album cover; in this case it's an accurate representation of the music inside. Slip inside..."
5,Nintento DS Lite Crimson/Black,GREAT SERVICE: received and have enjoyed it. Bought for my grandchildren and they love it. Great entertainment for kids when they are traveling.
5,excellent delivery,"I ordered this gift for my daughter on 25th DEC and was suppose to arrive on 29th , however, it was delievered on 28th early morning. It was a grand surprise for my daughter to get her Cristmas gift early morning. She was so excited that I had a strong believe on Amazon that they always deliver on time or before time.Thank you Amazon for the beautiful moments that we all share that day."
5,DS,I ordered this DS for my son for his birthday. It came in fast and wrokes great. It came in before I expected it to and in great condition. This is diffenantly a good buy for anyone.
5,What else can I say?,"There's not much more for me to say that hasn't been said by others about the good points to this system. I can say this: I was at a coffe shop the other day and there was a young boy (about 8) playing his DS. Around the corner from him there were several older (mid-60's) gentlemen playing their DS's. What other gaming system has that?I LOVE my DS system, I can't imagine being without it!"
2,Not so great,"This will be going back didn't realize I had over paid for it so much, bought it for my 9 yr old and he was so unhappy and said it was a old version. My older son said I paid way to much for it and could have gotten one much cheaper through Game Stop, what did I know. I am sending it back hard to find games too."
1,bad sale,this item was sent to me and I had problems from day one and was a big disappointment for me as well as my child cause she was looking forward to this for her birthday. how would you feel to want something and you get it and it doesn't work.and to have to explain it to a teenager.
5,"""best Christmas EVER!""","My daughter loved her DS so much, that was her reaction! Everything was just as described and the shipping was super fast! Thank you so much!"
1,Was good while it lasted...,"I had purchased this off of here because I did not have the funds to purchase a brand new device. So I saw that this was a refurbished one being sold for a lower than new pricing and it was in ""great"" condition. Initially when I received the device it worked flawlessly, I was happy. But then about 2 1/2-3 months down the road all of the sudden the touchscreen on the device started losing it's calibration and responsiveness. It was already out of the return period so I did not bother to make anything of it, I just lived with not being able to play touch screen interactive games. Today as I was searching through my recently boughten products I ran across this and decided I had better write a review for everyone.Buyer beware when purchasing a refurbished device from this company. Initially it may seem likea good product, but there may be a good chance just a few months down the road it will break down again as their fixes are only temporary."
2,noes lo q se esperava,pos el producto concuerda con la descripcion pero trajo uno q otro defecto como q los botones l y r no funcionan
5,....AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got my ds lite yesterday and I can't believe it. The first thing you think when you see it is ""oh my god!!!!!!!! it's amazing"". I played the ds lite at target so i thought I wouldn't be sorprised when i opened but I was wrong, I was so amazed!!!!11 the ds lite is way better than the original DS.The screens are unbelieveable!! I compared them whit my old DS' and i couldn't believe it, they're like 100 times brigther!!! I have set the brigthness at level 3 so the battery last longer. I highly recomend it even if you already have an old ds like me, you won't regret it. PD: The volume appears to be a little bit lower but that's not a problem. PD2: When you put mario kart ds on the ds lite mario says ""here we go"" instead of ""yeahoo"" at the begining. Oh and the games are so much colorful, they look like totally diferent games!"
1,highly irritated and very disappointed,"On April 30th, 2011 I ordered a Nintendo DS lite Metallic Rose for my granddaughter from Amazon. It arrived and she was ecstatic. She didn't play with it for more than 10 minutes when it quit.Got a hold of company and they said they had been having trouble with them. It has now been sent back 3 times and they just got it back a week or so again and it still isn't working. They wouldn't send a new one, they refurbished it, Come on people...if the U.S. made crap like this we'd never sell anything. I thought I was doing something special for her and it is a piece of crap. I have never been so disappointed as I am in this and my granddaughter is disappointed in me...Kathy Maas ketogirl@hotmail.com"
4,Well.....,"It's a DS Lite, and it's pink. What else can i say? It was a gift for my wife and she loved it. Until then she didn't know it came in pink. Now we link up on long trips and play against each other. For the record, no mine isn't pink. ;)"
1,profoundly disappointed,"Ordered this in October for my 7 year old for Christmas. When it arrived, we turned it on to ensure it worked, and then we promptly wrapped it and put it away. Much to our chagrin and my child's broken heart, we discovered on Christmas day that while the game console we purchased worked when charged, it did not charge unless you actually held the charger a very specific way ... THE ENTIRE TIME IT CHARGED. Thinking it was simply a bad charger, we got a new charger and tried that, and nope. It's not the charger; it's the console. But of course, it's too late. The returns window was closed. Few people consider testing whether or not a product charges when it's holiday time, and we feel we got screwed royally. My child did not get to enjoy his gift, and we cannot yet afford a new one.Thanks, Amazon, for this. I wish you could have provided better service."
1,Nintendo DS Lite Coral Pink,"It was false advertisement on this item. It is not ""Like New"" as stated!! It has been dropped as the corner is chipped & there is a dotted line going through the top screen, completely unsatisfactory! The item had not even been wiped clean of dirt & smudges. The stylus is red & stained. None of which was noted in description. This is something you'd expect in a garage sale, not on Amazon.com! This item was to be a Christmas present, but I would not gift someone something so faulty."
1,Didn't work at all,"I didn't realize that this DS came from a company in China. It took them 4 weeks in shipping. When it arrived, it only worked one time for 20 minutes. It wouldn't charge. We tried a new charger...nothing. We replaced the battery and that didn't help it either. It was a complete waste to buy this. I wouldn't go with this seller if it could be avoided."
3,Like New but NOT!,"This was to be a gift so I was disappointed that it came without the original box. Since it was rated ""like new"" it should have had the original box. There was no paperwork with it, no instruction manual....nada! We gave the gift to our grandson and I am hoping there are no problems."
2,Not happy,I bought this as a Christmas present. Wouldnt turn on after a month. Thought it was the battery so I got a new one and still the same thing. Wasted money!
5,DS was in great condition,very satisfied with the product. I got another DS from another company and their DS was not the same quality as this one for the same price.
5,Nintendo DS Lite!,"What I didn`t like about the regular Nintendo DS is because it was big and clunky,not to mention fairly heavy,so I never bought the original DS I bought a PSP,now I heard DS Lite was coming out,I played one and tgought it was a big improvement and actually bought one.You can do the exact same stuff as the original design but this is much better because it can easily be fit into a pocket,unlike the original DS and PSP which would stick right out.It has a brighter screen and is less fragile to damage.All I,ve gotta say is the DSL is worth the extra 10,also buy a PSP if you can they`re great too,Nintendo makes excellent consoles and I look forwards to their next handheld."
5,Nintendo DS Lite,"I think this is a amazing product. It has a bright screen and it is very fun. I suggest you get this other than the regular DS because it has much more features. For instance, a lighter weight, not like the origanal DS which was a little bit heavier. It can also fit into your pocket which is a nice thing. And when you have to go, just flip the screen down and it will automatically go in sleep mode. This is a very amamzing product and I think everybody should have it."
4,DS Lite from WorldWide,"I received the DS Lite a week ago, and so far, it's running good, according to my son. This is certainly not a new unit, as advertised, since the previous owner has registered his japanese name. Overall, I hope it will run well for the next 12 months. Thanks.Nintendo DS Lite Metallic Silver"
5,nintendo ds lite cobalt,Bought for my son & he loves it. The order was a last minute birthday gift & happy that it arrived sooner than date given.
5,Nintinedo DS,Absolutely love this thing. I bought one for my daughter and then one for my 5 year old grandson for Christmas. Well worth it's money and a real stress reliever. Great product
5,Nintendo DS Lite Crimson & Black,"Great product, great color. Easy to use. Very clear screen image. My daughter just loves it. Extremely fast shipment by Amazon."
5,Great Game Console,"This is a fantastic console, and great for mulitplay. For head to head gaming on most games (non internet based), only one game cartidge is required for up to 4 ds consoles to play. Game software is shared via wireless connection. Then there's the internet gaming (so long as you have a wireless).Just don't waste your money here, sorry Amazon. Other walk in stores sell the ds lite for the same price REGARDLESS of color. Why the crimson is more expensive than the white or black? ???"
5,Can a handheld be any more fun?,Not only is this a fantastic game but also expands the potential for education with the various innovative games. I'm glad I didn't get the PSP. Touch Screen and voice recognition mic has an almost limitless potential for games and learning. Touch and learn.
4,Nintendo stays strong with this handheld gaming system,"Nintendo has only been making small steps in their pocket gaming systems over the past 15 years, and have not evovlved much from original gameboy. Finally they have color, and now with this double screen, more things can be done to interact with the games. The graphics are decent, but I still really like the title selection, and the kid friendlyness. This does not have a bunch of the blood and guts games, much to the dismay of some adult gamers, but I feel comfortable giving this to a 6-9 year old and feel they may actually see something valuable in it other than violence. That is the other reason nintendo has been kept alive, is because of the family. Worth the a look, the price is a lot less than PSP, and features are basic, but still a fun gaming system."
4,Nintendo DS,"I recently purchased the Nintendo DS gaming system for my daughter using Amazon. The product arrived in days after I could not find it in stores. She has not put the thing down now in several weeks. The game was easy to set up, stores away neatly, and is compatable with several age appropriate games. I am very happy with the product."
5,Nintendo DS Lite,"I enjoy this product very much. In fact, this is my second one. My first one broke at the hinge so I replaced it. It is not just for kids. I am 68 years old and I enjoy the card games, brain games, and crosswords. It is so easy to take with you when you have to wait in the doctor's office, etc. for a long time. Would not be without it."
5,NEVER BORED!!,I am currently in Iraq right now and needed something to keep me busy on my free time. I orginally had bought a PSP but got bored with it fast and didnt enjoy the games it had. A lot of my friends were buying DS Lites so i figured why not get one too. The system is GREAT! not only are the games extremely fun but i found out i can play Game Boy Advanced games that the DS doesn't have yet. i love that i am able to use a touch screen for most of the games. Zelda will never be the same! This is a great gaming system!
4,I don't really know -,I personally didn't play with this game but my grandson played with constantly during Christmas....whether he will continue to use it still remains to be seen. It is very small and portable which is good for car usage but seemed a little on the delicate side to me as you have to use a stylus and this might cause some problems after awhile.Ask me in a month or two if it's worth the money or not....
5,10-year-old's Delight,"My 10-year-old daughter has been lobbying for this since Christmas. When we finally ordered it, she talked about it every day until it finally arrived. She couldn't be happier with it. We also bought Nintendogs at the same time. So far that's the only game she has but she loves it and is just now (almost a month later) talking about getting some more games.I have to admit, she showed me how to use it and I had some fun getting the puppy to sit, taking it for a walk, etc. She and her friends like to do the chat thing as well.I'm happy with the purchase."
5,My kids love it!,"All of my children, including my 5 year old got a Nintendo DS for Christmas. They all love them. I was afraid it would be too complicated for my 5 year old, but he does just fine. The games designed for younger kids are simple enough for him, and the older games are fun and challenging for my 14 year old!"
4,Love It,This game system is so much fun I have to buy another one because 4 people are always using it. We love it
3,Nintendo,"We gave our granddaughter the Nintendo DS for her birthday; we only saw the top of her head for the remainder of the day. The design makes it easy to hold; the graphics are engaging, entertaining and educational."
5,Very pleased,This is exactly what we had in mind for our son for Christmas. He loves it and has lots of fun playing with it.
4,fun!,It is a fun little gadget to play games on. I thought that it would be more technologically advanced though. It's heavier and bigger than I thought as well. Overall though it's nice. I really like the silver.
1,Bad experience,Pesimo really was because it is the second time buyer esteq team on amazon and I reached it yet I was charged at the first opportunity I paid like a month and half and this opportunity and make the claim and neither me nor have I made reemboso it is Ds. With agredezco with respect to know if Limewire harms support
1,I hate this thing - but my wife loves it,Was part of a surprise x-mas gift. She loves the nintendo ds and the games. plays it all the time. so much for romance.
1,Game,My granddaughter received Nintendo DS as a Christmas gift from us. She uses it everyday and is extremely happy to have it.
1,Nintendo DS,The product was never received! I ordered this for a birthday gift and it never came in. The order was cancelled and I am due a refund.
3,Summary Nintnedo DS lite,"This device haven't pen and bottom screen is scratch.The keyboard function is ok and screen resolution its amazing, all its components is ok."
1,It had abroke hindge and very scracted up,I was very disapointed it stated it was in very good condition. When I receieved it it had a broken hidge and was scracted up. My 3 yyear old grandson noticed right aaway it was broken.
3,?????,how many hours does this really hold a charge?has any one tryed this with the tap to talk app?
2,Excelente juego,"El nintendo DS es un excelente sistema, mejor que el PSP, se los recomiendo mucho, ya que la opcion de Wi-Fi es muy buena y los titulos que tiene son excelentes."
3,Doesn't recognize written/verbal responses,"I bought this for the Brain Age game only. I like the idea of the game alot, but it is frustrating when the Nintendo DS doesn't recognize a verbal response. It is also very, very poor at recognizing the memorized words you need to write on the screen - this raises your brain age and it isn't a true test!"
4,Great fun but. . .,"I have been enjoying my new toy but the thing I wish it had was a battery reminder to let you know that you are just about out of battery and to charge or change your source of power. I had to go back and redo several puzzles because of losing power while playing Professor Layton and the Curious Village. One game, Brain Age 1 or 2 told me I was getting low but that is the only one I have seen do that. Hooking up to the internet was quite easy with on line instruction and I have been downloading games to go with Professor Layton game. Buy a screen protector right away so that you dont scratch it all up--I have already replaced mine and it has only been about a month. I can only imagine what my screen would look like if I hadnt done this."
3,Not very durable,"My 8 year old daughter got this from Santa for Christmas. Two days after, she sat it on the counter(not very well placed) it fell off and the top screen stopped working. It started as a line going accross the screen and over a couple of days it turned completely black. She loved the gift a lot, it's just not made for children. Kids drop things, that's just a fact of life."
5,Got this 4 Christmas,"This year my mom decided to get me just 1 big thing with some little ones 2, instead of the usual, which was still good with me. I decided 2 do my research as 2 what I should ask 4 so I went on 'amazon' and did my research on the ds lite. Turns out there are more pros than cons. I fell in love with it. We also travel a little bit so getting a base system wasnt gonna work.Anyways, on christmas I got the coral pink version with a game and a case. I loved it. I had a Game Boy Advance, so these graphics were amazing in comparison. The charge also lasts a really long time so if you go on a trip just make sure it has a full charge b4 you leave and it should be good 2 go.I also was impressed with the interaction using the stylus and microphone. Especially with Nintendogs the simulation couldn't get any better.All in all, if you are a gamer searching 4 a portable system the ds lite is definitly the way 2 go."
5,Thanks amazon!,I looked everywhere for the Polar White Nintendo DS Lite for my daughter for Christmas...I found it here (and free shipping)!
4,Nice!,I love the style and look of this DS system. It's a plus that the bottom of the unit is a matte finish so the fingers prints won't show and it will not scratch easily. The only problem I have it that my right forefinger tends to sit on the side and it is a little uncomfortable to hold. BUT no pain not gain - I will keep on playing!
5,What a blast!!,"As usual, Nintendo comes through with a great product. And with Amazon there was no waiting in lines or worrying that it would be out of stock.AWESOME DEAL!! Thanks AMAZON!!"
5,"Loved it so much, we ended up buying one for every person in the house...","I actually like playing multi-player games on the Nintendo DS MUCH better than on consoles like our Xbox and PS2. When we are all playing together on console games, I have a hard time telling which car is mine, but on the Nintendo DS, it's so simple!If you are trying to decide whether to buy the DS or the PSP, go with the DS. There just aren't enough fun games for the PSP, whereas the Nintendo DS has a ton of games, plus it plays all the Game Body Advance games as well. Plus, the DS is less expensive than the PSP. It's just better in every way."
5,"Nintendo DS, a Mommys quiet time.",My daughter is 7 years old. She has Autism. Taking care of an Autistic child can be a challenge. Once a day I allow her to play with her Nintendo DS that I purchased from Amazon on line as long as she has good behavior. I allow her to play for a half hour. I use it as a way to reinforce possitive behavior. The added plus: this is my break time. Autistic children sometimes focus on one thing and stay that way. They get really good at that one thing and that's all they want to do or talk about. I am very careful that she only plays with it for that half hour each day. It is so easy to use and very portable. A must have for those long car trips or visits to the doctor. My daughter has become very good at her Nintendo DS in a short period of time. I love it when she play with it because I get that half hour of uninteruptid time to myself. And that is a blessing to me! Thanks Amazon and Thanks Nintendo!
4,Good Product,"My daughter and I are very happy with this product, no complaints. Very pretty color, works excellent, satisfied."
5,48+ and love it!,"I don't play everyday. I use mine to keep my mind busy while in a sit down restaurant or in a doctors office or waiting for the car to be serviced. Basically any down time. At home I am on a computer, but I really like having this device when away from home. Sometimes I plat in it while doing labor intensive projects on the computer. As you can see I have trouble with sitting still. At my age it is to EASY to fall asleep ;)! I highly recommend this for kids and adults. I use a paperback book carrier that you can buy from any book store for around $10 to carry mine around and I keep my extra games in it also in those boxes where you can store 3 games at a time. It is a perfect solution and I don't feel so odd carrying it around!"
1,I have not received my order yet.,I have not received my order yet. Can you please send me a tracking #?
1,Thumbs DOWN for Nintendo!,"This was purchased as a gift for my 17 year old son. He suffered a grand mal seizure playing it, and prior to that had NEVER had one in his life. I spoke to Nintendo and was not impressed by them at all. It is being returned directly to them, will never buy Nintendo again - EVER."
1,"Price gouging not appreciated, 3rd party sellers....","Why would I pay over $200 for something that is sold brand new in the stores for $129? Yes, its the holidays and the stores are mostly sold out but its not an excuse to take advantage of people. Its a very sleazy way of doing business."
4,It's Okay,"The condition is okay, but it works okay, which is why I wanted it. I love that it came with a purple stylus, it's my favorite color."
1,nintendo ds lite colbalt/black,they sold me broking item.my son play just once with this nintendo and it is not working anymore. payed some thing ever $80 for just a month is not good.
1,Not a game,"The DS worked as promised, would buy from them again. I ruined it trying to put a new shell onto it. The other person lied and didn'tsay how difficult it was to do. But the DS was perfect....when I got it."
5,Having Fun!,"I purchased this for my son, but he is not getting much playing time. Mama is addicted and won't give it up! I guess I will need to get another one just for me. :)"
4,Coolness!,"I'm totally in love with my new Nintendo DS. There isn't really much to complain about, except for the fact that the device needs to be re-charged every day to every other day, though I really cannot be described as someone who's constantly playing. That's why had to take off one of the five stars."
3,Good 2 years ago,"Bought this over 2 years ago, and after having used it extensively I must say that the fact the battery is still lasting and the games are still working, it is quite a good purchase, unfortunately now with the new DS coming out and the publishers moving on, I wouldn't be purchasing this in 2011."
5,Nice color for a girl,"I got this DS for a girl I like (I'm such a wuss), and she seemed to enjoy it, because I bought it with New Super Mario Bros DS game.Very cool color, it stands out from the white DS (mine) and the black one, which is ever so opaque that I really don't like.Nothing different than the color, though."
4,Nintendo DS and Brain Age,I bought the DS and Brain Age to see if I needed brain training...answer YES! My first test rated my brain at age 80! How depressing! So... a little training and puzzle solving and I'm down to 61. More training and I scored a brain age of 51! Not bad for a 66 year old. Now I'm afraid to test again for fear that the 51 score was a fluke... but the puzzles are still a great passtime.
5,Great Console!,"I just love my new DS Lite! it is awsome, and it is smaller than the first launched DS."
2,Not happy at all.,"I ordered this back in 2012, in October. It was cheap, and it shipped fast. That's probably the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. I had written a review because there was a problem with the system, and the seller had offered to take the one that was broken, and sent out a new one (Considering that it was received broken). I was then content that my son would get a new DS, and it would all be done with. It later carried out until December because they had a lack of communication with me, and then I wrote a response on the 29th of December. Today is 2/6/13 and I have still not received a new DS. I would not like another one, and will not ever be buying from this business ever again. I am leaving this post on here because I want people to know about the lack of business I had with this company."
4,Can't Say I'm Disappointed,"I've been wanting a DS Lite for a while now and since the New Year came around, I figured, 'why not blow the money on this'. It came in on time, and I was expecting a Crimson/Black DS Lite as ordered, but it turned out to be ALL red. Nothing like I've seen before, but apparently it's found in the UK and/or Hong Kong. I didn't give much thought about its authenticity and whatnot, but now I am. My dad was more excited than me to open it up, and the box went straight to the trash can, so I can't tell for sure whether or not my order was a sham. Although on the system itself, I'm more than satisfied, so I suppose it's just my conscience getting the better of me. Probably would've saved me the trouble if I received what I originally ordered though."
4,cool,it was in good shape and work good and this was the only thing he wanted for Christmas last year and it was the only thing he played with all day
3,Gift,I got this as a gift for my son. He was disappointed as it is glitchy and doesn't work as well as expected. Seller replied to return request so that we could return item.
5,Nintendo DS Lite Cobalt / Black,"excellent, it is very important to me. I liked the product, it's just as I wanted. and of excellent quality, and precise specifications thanks."
2,Its not like the picture,I dont like it. Its not the picture! The stick that came with it is not pink! its red and all chewed up! Would not recommend anybody!
2,Nintendo DS,"The machine was very dirty, the stylus was missing and the colors on the upper screen are off. If the condition had been ratedfair i would not have purchased it. Price to high for condition. I have purchased used products before and found the rating to bevery accurate."
3,No charger or stylus.,Works fine and plays great. Glad to have it but I wish there was a charger and stylus with it.
3,nintendo ds review,"The nintendo ds worked fabulous the first week, and I used it three or four times. Then the following week I turned my ds,onand I. Clicked on the game I wanted and it didn't work I tried rebooting it,recallabrating the touch screen,ect. But nothing worked. The ds is fun, but not as fun wihout the touchh screen"
4,Good game but....,This product is good but has one issue.... the game charger is not universal i.e. input is 120V (US standard) & you would need to buy another charger 240V if you want to use it in Europe or Middle east.
5,Good entertainment package,"One of the best product in market to pack all those old games in new Karma.Lightweight,smart and very good product over all.I enjoy the gameplay and other creative application that I use on it.I'm very happy with this DS liteBUT, even if Nintendo sold me this thing on Amazon, I doubt it's genuineness. I bought it from here and paid for new one, but it seems like I paid for the refurbished or defective one because the battery is crap. I could barely play 4 hours even on minimal brightlight settings with very very low volume, no wifi. I read stories about this thing giving hours lot more than that.I'm gonna contact them very soon about the workaround. Not all new products might have defective battery, but in my case, battery is crap. and I'm really disappointed that every two hours of play, I've to plug it to power outlet and sit around it.."
5,Family connection,"Since my childhood, I've always had video games, it helped me form a strong bond with my dad, and now I've that same bond with my daughter, we have lots of fun using its wireless connection and going on one on one challenges, I recomend parents to do the same, just make the time for it, your kids will thank you."
5,Best bang for the buck,I was so glad they decided to bring this color out again. Previously it was only sold in a limited edition package that could not be found after Thanksgiving last year. This color looks so much better than the traditional pink that is also available. My daughter enjoyed it so well that I'm going to buy one for myself. Now if they only released the gold console like the special edition one that was released last year it would be great.
5,My Grandson LOVED it!,I bought this unit for my 9 y/o grandson for Christmas. He LOVED it & immediately began playing with it...it was that easy! I've ordered from Amazon before & my purchases are always delivered in perfect condition & in a timely manner. And shipping was free! Ya can't beat it!
3,Keep Your Regular DS,"If you already have it. Yes, the screen is brighter and has adjustment settings. Yes, the battery playing time is longer and the mic was moved, stylus is longer, yada yada yada. You've read all of that I'm sure.What I don't like about the DS Lite is that they made the speakers smaller and it is now quieter. So much for the ""rich stereo sound."" The loudest setting on the Lite is equal to about mid volume on the regular DS.And the control pad is smaller and more difficult to use now. Maybe I'm old fashioned but not every game is stylus friendly. The A,B,X, and Y buttons are closer together now too.The nice contoured edges of the DS where one rests their hands while playing were scrapped as well in the Lite redesign. I personally find the edges uncomfortable now.So, all in all, I say if you already have a DS keep it and don't bother to purchase a Lite. I don't think the hype lives up to the product."
5,tons of fun,I purchased this one for my 8 year-old daughter and she really like it. She play with it every day and it still work like the first day.
5,Game boy,"This was the second video game my son has had, and I have to say he loves it. Its great when we go on trips. It keeps my kids busy for hours. My daughter who is 6 has one as well and my son who is 4 enjoys it so much. I would have to say my children never leave home without there DS."
5,My husband loves this!,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas '07. He had a handheld PDA that had a stylus operated touch screen for solitaire. He played it all the time, and when it broke, I looked everywhere for another handheld gaming device with a stylus. Finally, this Nintendo DS Lite came out and it is just what I had been looking for. I bought Clubhouse Games and Touchmaster to go with it at Christmas.Last month we ordered the Tiger Woods PGA Tour '08 golf game, and that is his favorite now. He is a lifelong golfer and he has found this game to be extremely realistic to actually playing a round of golf."
5,Nintendo DS Lite,My son is absolutely thrilled with this handheld game! It is durable and the screen color and display are magnificant! Very easy to use and hours of fun!
5,GREAT SERVICE,I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE AND MERCHANDISE THAT I HAVE RECIEVED WILL DEFINTLY BE RETURNING FOR FUTURE BUISNESS THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!
5,They loved it!,"I purchased the Nintendo DS Lite for my 8 yr old daughter for Christmas. Not only did she loved it, but also my 17 and 13 old fight to play with it too! It is a great product, easy and fun to use!"
5,THIS THING ROCKS!!!:),This is the best thing that nintendo has ever done to a handheld it is also coming in Onyx and pink in semptember. and onyx isn't full dark black on the inside it's a lighter grey!
5,arrived quickly and to the description,the product arrived a good deal sooner than expected and came in a great condition. only thing missing was the piece that goes in the bottom to protect from dust and etc. other than that it is fantastic.
4,"Nintendo DS Lite for the ""grey haired""","Excellent product and a wide range of ""games"" - especially those that keep your mind active. I have to confess to getting hooked on Mario Kart as well!Boots up almost instantly and very easy to use.Battery life seems to be very good too.All in all good fun and an alternative to listening to my iPod when travelling."
3,Muy Interactivo,"El Nintendo DS que compre atravez de Amazon ha estado funcionando en perfectas condiciones tanto en programas de cartuchos para DS como para Game Boy, es un articulo muy bueno que permite interactuar con la maquina y el raciosinio dando pauta a mejorar la agilidad mental.Yo recomendaria este articulo para todos los ninos que tienen un coeficiente alto de inteligencia en donde pueden encontrar una manera facil y sencilla de mantener su agilidad mental de manera constante y educada. Mi hija tiene 11 anos de edad y ella lo maneja perfectamente pero no descuida sus estudios, ella sabe que despues de hacer las tareas de la escuela ella puede disfrutar jugando con el nintendo DS."
5,The best system to have for a road trip!,"My boyfriend bought me the Coral Pink Nintendo DS Lite, and I have been in love with it since the day I got it! There are so many different games to choose from, and even if you have finished a game, it is fun to pick it up again and start all over! If you're into Mario Bros. Games, I highly recommend the New Super Mario Brothers! I also have Animal Crossing, which seems like a little kids game, but it is filled with different challenges such as paying off your loan for your house, decorating your house, careers, managing money, etc. It's pretty much the game of life, but with animals as your neighbors LOL! I also love the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney games! If you are into suspense and solving crimes, these are great games! Hope my review helped!"
4,Nintendo DS Lite is a great system,"I got this for my son for Christmas and it has been a big hit. The screens are bright and there is so much more to do with this system. Nintendo hit the mark with this one. I wouldn't pay the mark-up price, however. No handheld system is worth $200 bucks."
3,Buy an extra stylus,"The game is great. My daughter loves it. However, the game comes with a slot to store the stylus, and the stylus falls out of the slot. It slides in very loosely and falls out simply by tipping the game to the side. My daughter has lost one stylus already and nearly lost the 2nd one yesterday. It was a great idea to include a slot for the stylus, but it needs to be improved."
1,Faulty craftsmanship! Hinges break easily!,"The DS Lite is a super fun gaming system that my children enjoyed...that is, until the hinges snapped off after only three weeks. Turns out this is extremely common, as a multitude of friends have experienced the same design flaw. Our systems were kept in cases & very well cared for. Put us in the big batch of users that suffered from this quality issue; had I written this review the first week of ownership, it would be 5 stars! Three weeks in, all I've got is a broken machine and a sad, sad little girl. Nintendo refuses to acknowledge what is clearly a pandemic design flaw, blaming the consumer instead. Shipping and repair fees are $80 for a machine that is $130 new; Nintendo told me how lucky I was that they charge so little to repair. Funny, I don't feel so lucky... Simply search ""broken hinge DS Lite"" and you will see the sheer universality of this issue among users worldwide. Ugh..."
1,awful,This nintendo ds was very very scratched it was really bad and I wanted to return it right away because I was not satisfied with it but the seller refused
1,NOT HAPPY,"I ordered this product on December 11, 2008, this was a Christmas present to my grandson, unfortunatly we have not received the product. It was paid for before it was shipped, I e-mailed the store that it was coming from Diva_Trinkets, and have not heard anything from them."
1,What game? I never received my order!!,"I never received the product, it's been a nightmare experience for me dealing with this company!!"
1,I am seething with anger.,"This was given to me as a gift last December 2007, it is only July and its not working anymore. I try to plug it in but it just wont work. The LED flashes for a second then it disappears.I found a lot of people with the hinge crack problem too.I went to their website and followed instructions which eventually led me to a place where I need to pay $50.00, either for the hinge crack or the part where the item doesnt charge anymore.Did they make this thing to get money off repairs? If so, kudos to them. I cannot believe nobody pressed charges on this faulty item. My DS wasnt even used that much, 4x a week and not dropped. I clean it with an appropriate cleaner with cotton.Just do not buy this. Do not. Get a PSP."
1,WARNING: THIS IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF....,"I bought this for my daughter for her 9th birthday. When we got it in the mail, I was already broke. The battery will not completely charge or even hold one. She was super disappointed. I don't know if I was sent a dud or what. But the reviews that claim this seller is legit must be friends and family. If you do buy from here, beware."
4,Cutest color ever.,"My Nintendo DS arrived fairly quickly, and was in great condition. Some debris was wretched in the crevices along the edge of it, but otherwise, it truly was like new. I mainly ordered this for the color and for that I'm satisfied. For some reason this cotton candy-like pink is hard to come by in game stores. The only pink available nowadays is that metallic pink, that I'm not a huge fan of.Would totally recommend."
2,DS,"This really came in handy for transfering my pokemon form one game to another, overall the screen is really scratched but i can deal with that."
5,Nintendo DS Lite,This game was exactly what we expected - although there is not that much of a change from the original Nintendo DS except for the button location. (in fact I like my original one a little better)
1,concern about funtional,I didnt receive the charger so how can i test its working or not. If charger is not included I will probably return this item
3,opinion,"my daughter loved it. i bought it because it was cheap. but after purchase, i realized that ds liet and the regular ds is very different. the price was a bargain. would recommend"
5,"No grand kid should be without one, I guess.","All four of my grandchildren have these, and although they are restricted as to how many hours per day they can use them, they all smitten. It sure makes drives in the car go by more smoothly..."
5,Great game,This was a hard to find Christmas present for my daughter. She wanted piknk and I was glad that I located it on your site. I enjoyed playing this game and it was easy to learn. She is enjoying this game and having a wonderful time. We love this game and have recommended it to other parents.
4,its great...,"i like my ds... im just not sure if its better than a psp... but its great if you are a Nintendo fan, and if you like casual games more then anything, it wireless capabilities are good, but it wont recognize WPA-PERSONAL wich my wii works fine with, so i had to change my wireless settings to WEP. other than that... its great mobile console... battery last forever... its light and its not that big for your pockets. an overall good system."
3,Nice game but not for me,Its a good system but its just not for me. I like the psp better. My girlfriend actually likes hers ALOT. She takes it everywhere so Im pretty sure it's a great system because she is VERY picky.
4,Absolutely LOVE my DS!!,To all of you that are still young at heart but not the typical age for gaming...the Nintendo DS is GREAT! I love puzzles and have enjoyed playing Brain Age and The Quest Trio. The DS is compact and easy to carry with you. The stylus makes playing games easy. Very reasonably priced! If you are reading this review....don't wait...go ahead and order one today. Now that I have a DS I can put games and accessories on my birthday and Christmas list for family members!
4,No complaints,"Received quickly, in good shape, and as was ordered. Daughter really enjoyed this as a Christmas present."
4,Review,It's functional and it works. Great selection of games among a grand swath of crappy shovelware. Look for good games and you'll have fun.
5,Nintendo DS,Unit works really well and charge last a long time. Keeps kids busy for long hours especially on vacations and best of all does not use regular batteries. This is a kids favorite with great graphics and interactve games.
4,Fun for whole family,We purchased this product for my 7-year-old and my husband surprised me with my own games from Nintendo. Now my child and I share the game and he can understand how it works better than I can. It was very popular this past year and Amazon was great about getting it to us. -- Mom in Michigan
5,fun for a 4 year old,My 4 year old nephew loves it. It's the perfect handheld game to play on long car rides and elsewhere.
5,Another Nintendo Masterpiece!,"This new DS ROCKS! I thought the original DS rocked, but this one is just stunning. The screen is so bright, its minimum brightness setting is as bright as the original's maximum setting! Also, the power button is on the side so you don't accidentally turn it off when you try to press up on the 4 way pad. That's not it. Also, it's a lot more stylish than the original, and it's smaller and lighter. The Lite can play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, AND Nintendo DS games. Finally, the touch screen is really good and the PictoChat is sweet.This is the same price as the original DS, and it's A LOT better, so if you're getting a DS, GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not for lefties,"Nintendo made great efforts to make this device usable by lefties, but didn't quite make it. For example, Brain Age asks if you are a lefty, instructs you to turn the DS over and changes the orientation of the screen displays to match. Unfortunately, you have to use the DS in the righthand mode to get to that point. A manual switch would have been better, setting it up in left or right mode from the start. Once Brain Age begins, even though the touch screen is now in the proper position, the actual screen layouts remain the same, so you are stuck living in a righties world again. Not good."
5,great product,I bought two of these for my kids since they were perfect gentlemen this summer. They helped out around the house and really did their best to be good. Both have using them for a few months pretty hard ... it's held up great and performs as expected. A good entertainment value.
1,Okay,It's an okay ds but it s kind of plain. I recamen the the smaller 3ds. Join me on YouTube by the name of rnelson299
5,great,the ds lite is the only portable gaming system that I have ever owned. I got it for christmas back in 05. works great for what i understand. you can use a touch screen wich is really cool.
3,worked but not fully as wanted,It had to be sent back because the lower screen would go gray after about 5 min of play after turning it on.
1,didnt work from the start,the screen had intermiten blackouts and lockups from day one and got worse wish i had spent the monet to buy a new one
1,I meant to order a 3ds.,I meant to order a 3ds.and You misspelled my name. It is Lasswell=Had to go thru the refund process- Not a fun thing to do-Lost money on the deal. Not cool Amazon
3,Nintendo DS Lite Metallic Rose,"It arrived as promised and packed very well. The overall appeareance was great, but the sound quality is poor (volumne won't turn up) - that would have been nice to know since the price was close to the amount of purchasing a new one."
4,Como comerciante,"El equipo es bien apetecido por mis cliente, realmente no soy usuario del mismo sino un revendedor y el producto goza de muy buena aceptacion por el publico hispano..."
5,Not Just For Kids,"We are in our mid 60's. We each got a DS and found hours and hours of portable entertainment. New York Times Cross Words, Brain Age, Solitare, Sudoku all great adult fun."
5,Great DS,"With college and work, I have been reduced to a casual gamer; however, the DS Lite has been great so far in allowing me to get my gaming urges satisfied and while being portable and allowing me to quickly shut a game down without losing my place or my progress. Also, the battery life is pretty great."
5,Good gift for my grandson,"My grandson was very excited with the birthday gift. He plays with it quite often. And, of course, he can do more than I could ever do. I'm glad he is happy."
4,GRANDSON LOVES IT,I got this for my grandson who lives in Japan. I was very pleased that they were able to send to an FPO address and so very promptly as well. Very pleased with service and my grandson is very happy about his DS game that came with the DS unit.
5,Great handheld game system,"Purchased for 11 y.o. and she loves it. Good deal at $129 before the Christmas rush. I later got a second one from a retail chain that came with a nice little accessory kit, so I had to buy a second accessory kit for this one. We've tried Catz game, Horse Life, Super Mario, Star Wars, and High School Musical games and they've enjoyed them (not so much H.S. Musical yet). We've read the directions about how to share a game, but haven't gotten it to work yet. Kids love the pictochat functions. All in all, money well spent."
5,This was one great purchase!!!,I was saving up my money to buy the ds because my friend had one and I loved to play it. I finally had enough money and it was the best thing I have ever bought!! I can pictocaht with my frineds play cool games and it looks cool too. The ds is an awesome system and everyone should have one!The bad things about the ds are you have to within 65 feet to pictochat with someone the games are 30 dollars each( I think that's a bit too much) and you have to be careful with it it is really fragil. But still it's awesome and I love mine!
1,The color mattered to my autistic son!!!!!,"Was purchased for my son who is Autistic and bought only based on the fact that it was sold as ""Crimson"" and black. The unit we received is solid black, disappointing him and frustrating me to no end trying to explain why there was NO RED anywhere on it. The stress this caused will keep me from purchasing anything else where the color is so very important to my son, I spent hours consoling him and trying to find a way to make this acceptable to him."
2,Nintendo DS,This game i just buy couple weeks ago now it not working at all .i check everything and i have throw it away
4,great entertainment to kill time with,"i dislike the way the DS lite is set up that everytime you go to the settings or the chat and would like to go back to the main menu, there's no such option, instead, the system will shut down itself like you're done using it. imagine you just want to make a little changes on the DS lite before starting your game, you have to turn it back on after changing the settings. but other than that, it's a good thing to keep inside my handbag and to entertain myself when i am waiting to work or waiting for a bus or even waiting for a meal to come."
1,Nintendo DS Lite Crimson / Black,"The ""new"" Nintendo DS Lite Crimson / Black received (came directly from China) quit working. The unit started shutting down intermittently, then completely. It will not charge or turn on. Ninetindo support informed me that the serial number is not valid and that the unit is counterfeit."
3,V-E-R-Y SMALL,"This game is great for kids, but I'm an adult. I want Mario back, the way I used to play the game in the 80's. My sons got me hooked on that game and I used to get up early to play before going to work, and I used to hope my sons were doing something else in the evening so I could play. Finally I just went to buy my own. I really wanted a Wii when I bought this, but it's way too expensive. I'm retired now, so I live on a budget. However, that still doesn't stop me from loving Mario. I can just imagine what it is like to play the game on a Wii."
1,Nunca llego,Pague habilitación para que el producto me llegara en tres días el cual nunca llego paso mas de 1 mes para enviarme por correo que el dinero seria reembolsado a mi cuenta por no poder entregar el DS.
2,what i dislike,"nintendo ds lite,the product was good on the box it reads charger included, what i did not like was that the charger was missing."
2,I am not satisfied with this,1. - This is not the color offered. I expected the color coballt (Blue)2. - Was dirty. (could have cleaned before sending)
3,Lorraine's review,When inputting letters/words the Nintendo doesn't accept my printing of words. Tried different ways to print the letters and they were not accepted as well.
3,"daughter loves it, but right hinge is nagging flaw","My 11 year old daughter loves her ds lite, but recently it's right hinge broke when it was dropped. I figured I could buy another broken one off ebay and make a working one out of the two ds lites. What I found instead is a whole lot of ds lites for sale with a broken right hinge. Apparantly when dropped, the right hinge is the hinge that ALWAYS breaks, making me suspect this is actually a design flaw rather than coincidence. The games are kid oriented, but the sony psp is far more durable and shock resistant. I have a psp myself, and while I don't think my daughter would find the game selection as fun, I really think Nintendo needs to make the design stronger and shock resistant."
4,Dead Pixels,"This gaming system is great. There is nothing new I can say about it that hasn't been said in the reviews before me. However, there is one tiny problem with my ds lite: dead pixels. It started out as one small pixel which permanently turned orange and never changed color again on the lower touch screen. As I continued to play with the ds, the ""dead"" areas increased so I had several more pixels which remained orange and refused to change color. Luckily, I purchased my ds at a store where I could return it within 90 days. I got a new ds lite and it has been perfect so far. But I just thought I would throw the dead pixel thing out there so you all would know."
2,DEFECTIVE DS METALLIC,"We've gone through two of these, within 2 years, same problem, sholder buttons not working. Anyway, we were going to return this and get a new one, it was then I realized that the metllic was on clearance and no other ds lite was, this leads me to believe that all ds metallics are defective. I had a Onyx ds lite and it held up for 3 years of beatings. The ds metallic can't stand 1 year."
5,DS Lite,Four year old was completely in awe and we were pleased with the DS lite as well. No issues at all.
4,Great Game System,The Nintendo DS Lite is a great game system--ordered it for my daughter and she loves it--it arrived quickly also.
3,Great Alarm Clock,"The console is nice. The best game I played for it so far was Touch the Dead. Touch screen works great. But the feature I love most about this is the fact that you can use it as an Alarm Clock, with a touch screen! It also has a headphone jack, so you can actually attach some sound system, and blast it up really loud. It helps me wonders, I sleep through a lot of alarms. heh, great alarm clock, decent console. But with small consoles (from my experience) games tend to get repetitive. I think its b/c the games cant hold a whole lot at the size. But its great for killing hours in a flight, long car ride, in a lobby, wherever you're waiting and cant get entertainment."
4,Nintendo DS Lite,"Great handheld. My son really enjoyed it. The blue really holds fingerprints. Other than that , it's perfect."
5,A great way to keep your brain busy!,"I use it with the Brain Age game and is a great way to make me think! instead of riching out for the calculator all the time!A great way to keep yourself busy when you have to wait at any place, like airports for example. Small enough to carry in your purse."
4,"Overall Product is good, the seller, not so good","The nintendo DS itself is a great product. Having tons of fun playing the new pokemon black/white. Everything works fine. The seller that I had bought it from, however, failed to mention what terrible conditions the DS was in. It was nasty, gunk in the crevices. They did warn me of the cracked hinge, but failed to mention its cleanliness.That's okay though, considering I found a new housing replacement shell for it the next day to replace the hinge and disgustingness.Conclusion: Nintendo DS (two thumbs up) Seller (one thumbs down, middle finger up)"
3,"Works fine, more exterior damage than expected","The ds game works fine, but there was quite a bit more exterior damage than what was described. Deep scratches across the top cover of the ds, top lid is loose when it is open. Other than that, the game does work fine - just disappointed in overall appearance and loose lid since it was a Christmas gift."
5,He loves it so much we have to limit it's use,"Got this for our 4 year old son for Christmas (he thinks Santa is the best for this present!). He hasn't stopped playing it since then, except when we make him take a break from it. It's hugely entertaining, and I have to say I enjoy playing it and watching him play it as well. We go a Kirby game and a Sonic game to go with it and he really loves them both. Awesome!"
4,PINK DS LITE,this was a very good purchase especially on my part in that even tho the product was second hand its actually looks spanking new .great service and spot-on item.good work
5,Great buy!!!,"I love the Nintendo DS Lite. It is a great game system to play on the go, and Brain Age is a nice tool to help keep your brain active."
5,Gorgeous!,"I've been playing the DS for a long time (since the original version) and when DS lite came out I was VERY excited to see all the new colours. When I saw that a special red and black version was coming out I just HAD to sell my white one and get this one!The best part about the crimson & black DS is that it doesn't have that shiny plastic over the whole thing (just on the red backing) so if you're like me and get twitchy when there's finger prints all over your DS you don't have to worry with this one!Also, because the other DS' have that plastic coating around the edges, I'm sure you've noticed (especially on the white one) that dirt and 'gunk' gets into those tiny little crevices, making it almost impossible for you to keep it clean. Because the crimson & black one doesn't have that: you don't have to worry about the dirt! :DOverall this is a fanTASTIC version of an already mind boggling game system. Again, DEFINITELY worth the investment! :D"
3,Nintendo cheapens out on the Crimson/Black DS Lite,"I was so excited to received the new Crimson & Black DS Lite. I even sold my Onyx one. When I started using it, I noticed right away that the screen quality was different. When you tilted it forward or back, visibility would be far worse. This was not a problem with the previous models. I wondered if it was just in my head, so I did a search online and found articles reporting this same exact problem.As it turns out, Nintendo did purchase cheaper LCD screens for their new models. These screens are considerably worse than the Onyx and other color models and led me to returning this product.The Crimson and Black model does look very nice though. I personally did not like the back of the player. It has a rough feeling, compared to the glossy back of the onyx and is not as compfortable to use. Also,"
5,The Best Handheld Portable to Date,"The Nintendo DS Lite is by far the best handheld/portable gaming system available on the market. Clever, intuitive, and unique, it brings new life to video games. They have improved upon the older DS by incorporating a brighter screen, sturdier body casing, and crisp graphics. The games are of much higher quality than those found on the PSP, and it offers features that I find to be much more worthwhile. The Wi-Fi is an interesting feat of technology, and the ability to play as all kinds of classic Nintendo characters in their original environments is undeniably fun. If you're looking for a console that provides great performance and quirky fun the Nintendo DS Lite is your best bet."
5,Excellent purchase,"I really enjoy my DS lite. I recommend purchasing the DS lite over the other recent DS systems due to the fact that you can play all your original GBA games on this handheld that you can the DSI series. Came brand new with factory seal, and excellent packaging. I absolutely love this handheld, and I would highly recommend this to anyone."
2,Broken,I received a broken DS. Not too happy about that even though the rating was acceptable... Broken is NOT acceptable
4,ds lite white,its pretty god i like it but thats about it its a ds lite plain and simpile 7 out of 10
4,BUENO....,"TIENE UN DISEÑO AGRADABLE Y ELEGANTE, ES DE CALIDAD Y BUENOS CON VARIEDAD DE JUEGOS Y FACILIDAD DE LOS MISMO.."
3,"Good, but breaks too easily","I returned an original DS to get this because the screen is brighter, but to my disappointment, the L button broke on this. So did the hinge, and it gets dirty far too easy. If you have an original DS, keep it. If you really want to buy this, get ready to send it in for repairs every few months."
4,"Fun, fun, fun!","love my nintendo ds lite! i got this console specifically for the brain age games and they're totally addictive. my brain is much heavier as a result. :~)the only minor complaint i would have is that the console doesn't come with a protective case. the ds lite shell is very attractive, but unfortunately leaves fingerprint marks very easily and so a book cover type case would have been very appealing to me. other than this minor issue it's a great product which i highly recommend."
5,Great Fun!,"Just purchased two of these for my seven and five year old daughters. They love them! I initially thought it would be too difficult for them, but I was wrong. They will sit and play for hours if I let them. A really great feature is they can use one game cartridge to play with eachother. It does some kind of wireless download so as long as I purchase a game with the wireless capabilities they both can play it. They love Mario Kart! Also, the pictochat is alot of fun when they are on the school bus with several other DS users. The only complaint I have is now my thirteen year old son, my husband and myself all want one!"
5,Really Enjoyable Hand Held System,"The DS Lite is a MAJOR improvement over the original DS. Smaller size and brighter screens make it an attractive system, with a full library of enjoyable and sometimes innovative games (at least the ones that use the touch screen and microphone properly). At almost half the price of the PSP, you get a solid game system, which may not do everything under the sun, but does what it's supposed to well: play games!"
4,Not that impressed with service,"This is more of a comment about the service. It was poor. Because of human error which is human I bought the wrong system. Ok, I am human but the customer should have the option to return item and buy another product. My suggestion to everyone is to not buy from this particular vendor. Let me suggest to please purchase items from Amazon.com directly avoiding any problems with returning items that you are unsatisfied with or read extremely carefully. Power to the Players and to the Costumer!!!"
5,Nintendo DS is for children age 6 to 106,"I am a 46 year old woman with two grown children, that is enjoying my Nintendo ds. My 23 year old daughter has had one for a year or two, and said, ""Mom, you should get one"". Well, when my sister sent me an amazon gift certificate for my birthday, I used it toward a Crimson and Black Nintendo ds. I thought it would be fun, but I didn't realize how fun. I also, bought the game ""My Spanish Coach"", and have had fun with it. Although, too easy for me, as someone who is currently studying spanish, it would be great for the novice, both adult and kids. My service from amazon was great and it arrived exactly on the day they said it would. The game hardware itself is very easy to learn to use, even for techno babies like myself. I did not realize how many adult games have been developed for the Nintendo ds either, but there is quite a variety. So, even if you are a 40 something with no kids, you will enjoy the Nintendo ds."
5,Great babysitter for the kids!!,Purchased a black DS lite for my son's birthday in October '06. Both kids loved it so we bought my daughter one for her birthday in March '07. Battery life is fantastic and the systems are very durable. Only real complaint I have is that the games are so small and if not looked after can be lost easily.
5,Nintendo DS Lite,"OH, I could go on for hours on this product! I purchased this for my daughter (young woman) for her birthday; this has been the best gift I ever got her! I wanted to charge the battery so it would be functional when she opened it. I charged the battery and then thought I better test the Need for Speed Carbon edition! I spent the next 2 days playing on it! I would have taken it everywhere I went but it is pink : )This was no disappointment! I was playing with it and my girlfriend saw it and took it from me, she spent the next 2 days playing with it! We could hardly sit it down! Anyway, only downside, limited game selection. The quality of the unit is top notch! The sound - excellent! The video - even better! Gameplay quality - perfect! This is the best portable gaming unit I have ever had! This is better than the Sony PSP! The Sony looks better (the body of it) but the game play, video and sound are astounding on the Nintendo DS Lite!!!"
5,Handheld Console With A Good Price,"Improvements from the Original Nintendo DS- Extended battery life compared to the original DS- Brighter, more durable top and bottom LCD screens, with four levels of brightness- Larger stylus, but easier to hold- Capable of receiving Wi-Fi signals from other Nintendo DS Lites, the original Nintendo DS system, and Nintendo's Wii console- Future Support for Internet Browsing with Nintendo DS Browser (Powered by Opera like Wii)"
5,The Nintenod DS,Do you like tetcnolege? If you do the nintendo DS is for you.I love this prodict because if you close it will not lose power.But it will break easly and the games are awosem . I would buy this prodict again because it has triffic games.
5,Gift for my 12 year old daughter,So far so good....she plays it every chance she gets and takes it everywhere she goes. She can't wait to obtain more games for it. A very good game to buy for that age group!! I will be checking Amazon for their pricing on Nintendo games for the Nintendo DS Lite.
2,I love my Nintendo DS Lite!,"Nintendo has done it again. I have no complaints whatsoever. I received my ds lite as a Christmas gift and I haven't put it down yet! So far, I have New Super Mario and Brain Age. My neighbor has a ds and she has ALOT more games than I do, but she told me all the games she has, so I am getting some great game suggestions! I love the pictochat feature for talking to my neighbor without going to her house (Are you busy right now, can I borrow some sugar?). The cute pink color is just awesome for us girls and the bright lcds are just fantastic for playing in the dark or low lit areas. Get a Nintendo DS Lite, you will NOT be disappointed. Edited to add: The FUN stars should have had 5 stars there also, but I scrolled my mouse and changed it to 2 by mistake, believe me, THIS PRODUCT IS 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!"
3,too much planned obsolescence,"Nintendo DS Lite Crimson / BlackBought one just a year ago and it was fun. Then right after the warranty ran out, it quit working. Just stopped. The only options: Pay $85 and they'll send me a refurb in pink or black. If I want to keep the crimson, for which I paid extra, they'll look at it for $75 and if they can't fix it, they'll discuss my options. Whatever they might be.I haven't had any other electronics that lasted so short a time. Including ones I used a lot more. This bites."
5,nintendo ds lite great for 6 year old,"I bought this for my daughter's 6th birthday- she loves it. It is easy to use, comes with a charger and the stylus (in a great little nook within the unit so she does not have to keep track of it.) We bought the protective filters as well, which I think was a good idea as she taps a bit hard and fast sometimes. I also bought her a couple of games to go with it. She totally loves the Petz Dogz Fashion (only needed a little help with words the first time she played with it- spends hours on it without any help now.) The Imagine Babies also needed only a little help to start, but, after the first day, only plays with that for a bit here and there."
5,A great Handheld!,The Nintendo Ds Lite is a wonderful a great handheld gaming machine that is worthy to be used by people of all ages and stereotypes.Buy yours today and revel in the greatness of the Nintendo Ds Lite.Nintendo DS Lite - Polar White
1,if you are over 10yrs old dont buy it,i have owned this for two years now and there are no good games for this system whatsoever. the graphics are terrible. games that may be amazing games for other systems are destroyed in order to fit this system.i got call of duty 4 for it and the graphics are crap and the game is crap. the grapkics suck. i thought the toch screen would be cool but you can hardly use it without the stylus. you have to push very hard to do anything withouth the stylus. just buy a psp that has better graphics and they dont have to destroy games to make them work for the systempros:wireless multiplayer thing is cool.better than nothing?cons:crappy totch screen.most games made originally for other systems must be destroyed to fit this systemgraphics are crap.all games (that have not been destroyed to fit the ds) are baby games or games like mario.just buy a psp; the gaphics are better and you can get games that are worth playing.
2,"Good, if you are upgrading from a Gameboy!","When I first held the DS in my hands it reminded why Nintendo is a lost cause. Good for them that they are selling like hotcakes but you get what you pay for. After seeing what's now available on the PSP I just cannot fathom how people can still stomach Super Mario XCVIII when games like Super Ghost N Goblins, the Sega museum, Grand Theft Auto, etc. are available for the PSP. Now with the option of being able to access your PS3 with a PSP, expect more PSP sales. If you like simple games and cannot afford something better, go for a DS. If you're a hardcore gamer, you cannot go wrong with a PSP, especially since it's finally getting AAA games."
1,Be careful - don't travel outside of North America and hope to use it!,"What a dismal surprise! How can Nintendo be so myopic and build devices that can be charged only at 110V? Was it bad engineering or some marketing guru who thinks that customers traveling with kids to Europe would by a new one over there? Read their instructions: ""If you are moving to another country, it is highly recommended you purchase your portable game system in the country you are moving to. If you are traveling to another country, your best option is to purchase a step-down transformer. With a step-down transformer, the power can be converted to meet the requirements of the Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy micro, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo DS Lite."" Can you imagine if Apple would do the same with the iPod? Bad job, Nintendo."
5,Great Game system!,"I have a DS and my favorite thing to do is play multi player. Although they have newer and upgraded Nintendo systems, thisis a good starter for younger kids. Santa brought mine 4 years ago and it still works great and i play all the time. I recommend you also buy a case just in case you drop it. Buying a case will surley make your DS stay in good condition a lot longer. I love that there are so many different games for you to buy."
1,The X button is broken on many of these,Hey you should know the X button was broken on the first one we ordered from Amazon and then it broke on a 2nd one we got at another location. The red ones tend to have bad X buttons and the crimson rose ones freeze up - pick another color I say!
3,Nintendo DS sucks,"I have a PSP and i bougth the DS for my little cousin, in a few words the DS is a lame compared it to the PSP. If you are a little kid and you want to play Mario Bros the DS is for you, but if you really want to have fun, enjoy great games and graphics just get a PSP"
4,It is what it is,"Work without any kind of game breaking flaws.There may be some scratches here and there brought about by wear n' tear, but nothing that makes this unplayable.It just works and works well enough."
4,My daughter got it for her birthday,We got this for my daughter for her birthday and she really liked. She plays it all the time and it works really good. The screen is in great shape the case has normal wear and tear. Thanks so much.
5,6 year old loves it,"Got this for my 6 year old for his BD and he loves it, though now he wants the 3DS, of course!"
1,Milk those cows,"Here we go again. Another Nintendo hand held with another upgrade in less than two years time. Its almost a fine way of admitting they never get anything done right the first time around. With a laundry list of rehashed titles, horrible graphics, limited use of its dual screen and stylus gimmicks, this makes the DS hands down the worst milking of any hand held since the Gameboy Micro slimed its way onto the market.Not to mention the game library is nothing but the same old titles reworked and rehashed for a fanbase thats too loyal to see how dull these games have become. Mario, Metroid, Zelda, Starfox...surprise surprise its the usual suspects. Too bad 3rd party support is awful as usual.Nintendo knows how to scam the consumer and the DS Lite is proof. In another two years you'll be buying a better version of the Lite as well."
5,My daughter loves it,Very easy purchase and the product was exactly what we anticipated. My daughter loves the game and the color was perfect. Would purchase with Amazon again! Great product and received earlier than promised.
5,Nintendo DS,"I got this DS for my son's birthday and he absolutely LOVES it, in fact my daughter is a little jealous and wants one for Christmas, which we have already gotten. So now we own 2 DS and as soon as Christmas gets here, there will no longer be any fighting over the DS!"
4,Good Product,I love this game. It is easy to handle and take anywhere. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a handheld game.
5,My Kid thinks its the best so far!,"Nintendo DS is another good product from Nintendo, another upgrade worth the time to play. My kid thinks its the best so far, and I'm sure the next go 'round will be even better."
5,DS Lite,"5 year old really enjoys this game system. Didn't take long to pick on how to use, play games, recharge and all. No road trips without it."
5,I play more than my son,"I bought this for my son as New Year's gift together with Mario Cart and Super Mario Bros. He loves it, but i love too. When he goes to sleep I play until battery dies and I have to recharge it."
4,Great metal withough screaming,"Alright, first off, for everyone who gave this album one star, you're out of your minds. The guitars, bass ,and drums are all incredible and take it back to the days of Iron Maiden, Megadeth, and Slayer, so it definately doesn't deserve one star. Most of the one star reviewers were die hard AX7 fans from the start and they should be the first to know that M.Shadow had surgery to repair his vocal chords and he's now unable to scream at all. The fact that he can sing, even though its not the greatest, is a miracle. This CD doesn't sound like the previous Avenged Sevenfold CD's but it does remind me of Guns N' Roses and considering the current state of metal and music in general, that isn't a bad thing at all. Pick it up and listen to it a few times, it'll grow on you"
3,"Good but, Different from Previous","When first listening to this CD I noticed a great deal of change from the first two CDs by AX7. The vocals greatly changed from a rawer metal feel to almost a nu-metal feel. If you like the slightly whinier feel to your music then you would enjoy his voice. The reason they changed so much though is because the lead singer actually had a great deal of damage done to his vocal chords from the way he was singing before, so this forced him to change his singing.Apart from the vocals the guitar is sensational; you can observe a great increase in talent from the first two albums to this one. At the end of the album there is a Flamenco guitar solo that will blow your mind if you know what I am talking about. The musical structure of this band is very complex and uniquely original. If you appreciate a strong musical composition I would suggest this band."
4,Not too bad...,"Just like many people on here who have given reviews, I'm an old avenged sevenfold fan. When I first heard that Shadows was going to sing the entire album, I was still pretty excited about what it was going to sound like. Hearing the album, I was pretty shocked at what they sounding like. It reminded me of a old Iron Maiden/Judas Priest album. I can see why many people are pissed off because they are no longer metalcore, but I still find the music pretty amazing. The dualing solos were awesome. The only thing I thought that was very disappointing was Shadows voice. I'm not disappointed by the fact that there is no screaming, but by the fact the vocals were not that great. The singing in the earlier album was much better, but now Shadows sounds really bad and corny. Despite the vocals, I still give it a 4 for the instrumental work. You do have to listen to this with a open mind."
5,MY FAVORITE ALBUM BY AVENGED SEVENFOLD,THE GUITAR WORK AND MELODY IN THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY IT IS MY FAVORITE AVENGED SEVENFOLD ALBUM.
3,NOT Avenged Sevenfolds Best,This is definitely not Avenged Sevenfold's best work. Waking the Fallen blew this way out of the water with it's hard/melody contrasting lyrics. I was disapointed with this album. I was hoping for more of Waking the Fallen's style and I got a softer more mainstream A7X.Few things I did like was the new heavier more guitar intensive songs. I love guitar and they needed more of it in Waking the Fallen and they delivered. Also more drums. Also good. But Shadow's voice just isn't the best in this new album. His screaming to melody style of the last CD worked much better.Cmon A7X. Bring the new heavier guitar and drop the new singing for the old and give us something better and new. I'll wait for it.
2,Wow... Avenged Sevenfold went downhill.,"Let me begin by saying that I would have given this cd 1 star had it not been for some good guitar work. Other than that, this CD is horrible. What happened to you guys? This isnt even metal anymore. There's no edge to it. It sounds like MTV manufactured pop with a bit of interesting guitar work. Well, thanks for losing everything you once had."
4,"New Sound, Graet Record","I first heard of A7X a few years ago when a friend had one of their albums. I've never been a big fan of the ""screamo"" vocals, so I totally looked past them. I read an article about Synyster and Zacky in Guitar World and read about M Shadow's throat surgery. Then I saw the video for ""Bat Country"" and was really impressed with the new musical direction. After I saw the video for ""Beast and The Harlot"" I decided to buy the album. Now, I had only heard two of the eleven songs but took a chance. This bad boy hasn't left my stereo yet. No screaming vocals, plenty of guitar solos, and a rhythm section you can hear and that works well together. As a fan of more traditional metal and hard rock, I highly reccomend this album."
2,Bubble gum Metal,"I first began listening to Avenged 3 years ago. There first two albums were solid metal releases. However this ""City of Evil"" is corporate crap. Sure there are some cool dual guitar attacks, but since being signed to a major label anyone who heard the old CD's can instantly recognize the change in style. The vocals have gone to hell...I hate the way he sings now. If you like corporate bubble gum metal this album is for you. If you like raw old Avenged Sevenfold save your money."
3,"Dissapointing, but not yet sell outs","Well A7x dissapointed lots of us by cutting out the screams, as many other bands have done. It's not really THAT big of a deal to me, considering the fact that I like this band mostly for their guitar. But nevertheless, the screaming helped get the hardcore guitar riff point accross. Now, what this album did was tell everyone that we missed the point. They came off as a metalcore phenomenon on Waking The Fallen, but they really are a modern day Ac/Dc on City of Evil. Whateva, I'll still buy it."
3,City of Evil Live Is Shit,"Relating to the previous review shadows cannot sing anymore, i agree.I seen them live in Glasgow.The support (mendeed if you wondered) stole the show.However shadows does have a reason.He blew his voice box at the Reading Festival in England.Surely you knew that!You should also know he had surgery and then vocal training from the person who trained axel rose amongst others.So if your going to see them live dont expect 'second heartbeat' or reminissions' cause he just cant sing them!!!"
3,Not what I expected...,This band has chosen to completely change their form of music & ditch their beloved fans. I actually compared this band to Atreyu & Bleeding Through. Now they sound nothing alike. If megadeath or iron maiden came out with this album it would not have bothered me but I feel like I have lost a good band. It's just not the same music now. Hopefully they will be back to making hardcore music on their next album.
2,Mellow Yellow,"OKAY, HERE IS THE THING... I HAVE LIKED A7X FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW AND LIKED HIS VOICE PROGRESSION OVER THE YEARS, BUT THIS CD IS THE MOST WATERED DOWN P*SS I HAVE EVER HEARD. THR MUSIC IS GOOD, BUT IF I WANTED TO HEAR THIS STYLE I'D LISTEN TO 80'S HAIR BANDS... NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. THIS CD IS NOT WORTH BUYING, MAYBE BURNING. I FOR ONE WILL BE SELLING MINE BACK TO THE STORE. HOPE NEXT CD IS BETTER"
4,Give it a few more listens before you rate.,"Yes, at first few listens, this album came to me as the ultimate letdown. after becoming an instant fan after the powerhouses of STST and WTF, this release looked like the ultimate letdown. overly nasal singing(most prominent in Bat Country), no screaming, poor song strucure, corny lyrics...all the ingredients for a disaster.yet i remembered that i did not like STST for the first few listens too.likewise, this release has to be savoured like wine. listen a few more times, even as background music. and u will find yourself humming to Seize the Day and tapping your feet to Strength of the World. Even M.I.A. becomes immensely listenable.Yes, this album is not the one we expected. But it comes nothing close of being the Train of Thought of Dream Theater and St Anger of Metallica. come on, its just a less impressive album. many bands out there cannot even come up with this on a good day.listen more, judge well, and hope for a more impressive future release."
1,A disgrace to metal,Simply a disgrace to metal. I never really was much of a fan of this band ever since their 1st album. But since seeing them on TRL. Has just brought them to my attention. SELLOUTS!!! The guy can't scream anymore all the guitar riffs and solos sound the same. This album is going to bring a lot of destruction for metal bands. People who were never interested in metal at all. Will simply jump on the band wagon and embrace this band. Next thing they will be touring with Backstreet Boys. This kind of metal is just like the NU-Metal. Most bands will break up and go out. Very few will be remaining after all is said and done. A lot of people compare Avenged and Atreyu. But at least Atreyu isn't on TRL. And they are better.All true metal fans stay clear of this one!
1,"Help Me Out If You Like This And Please Don't Sing ""Bat Country"" In My Ear","The other day I was minding my own buisness, when some idiot came up to me singing ""Bat Country"". 1. Don't come up to me singing 2. Don't sing songs that suck 3. Don't think that you are cool or metal just because you listen to a sucky band that credits metal as a influence. You know what Avenged Sevenfold means? It is long for EMO. Avenged Sevenfold has some ok old stuff, but not the new stuff. The only good thing about AX7 is that the lead whiner suppports Bush. That's cool. I hope that keeps alot of you idiots that are anti-war from listening to them.Anyways, you can buy this album if you want, just keep it to yourself. So that the only mind it corrodes is your's. If you don't want to buy this album now, buy ""...And Justice For All""-Metallica, ""Reign In Blood""-Slayer, and ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine""-Exodus. Cuz these bands (and albums) kick ass."
2,OK but,"LIMP BIZKIT ROCKS, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYOTCH!So does Kid Rock, go figure.A Van G D 7 x Fold or however you all abbr. it, well, they got some interesting rock, but it's too punk too boring and it just doesn't stack up to the kings of the 90's!laaaaaaaaaadeeeeeedaaaaaaaaaaaaaah [gggggeeeetar lick] [drdrdrdrdrdrrrrum tap] WAAAHAAA Punkrappunkrappunkrapsinging = ABC123XYZ Fold."
1,Garbage,"I went from liking this band to totally hating them. I dont know how a band can can from an average record to this garbage. These guys dress like a bunch of **gs, and think they are cool. The only people who like them now are the stupid people who tatooed the band logo on to their body somewhere, so they have to like them, it's like a deal with the devil. ""While agreeing to tatoo this band onto your body for eternity, you have to sware to love this band and it's music for their career, no matter how bad it is.""Dont buy this record!! If you really must hear it, illegally download it."
4,A7X City of Evil,Ok this is a great cd and after reading all of these reviews i was just confused. The reason this dosent sound like te last 2 cds is because it is not phyiscally possible M.shadows (the vocalist) screwed upa blood vessel in his neck a while ago and cant do wah the used to do so obviously iw wont sound the same.
3,"Loads of fun, but nothing new","This album brings nothing new to the table that Maiden or any other metal band from that era hadn't already done. With that being said, this album is fun as hell to listen to. No it's not that deep, lyrically or technically, but they can sure shred. They are a tight band with loads of talent. I miss the screaming, too, and I have a feeling that was the doing of some producer with Warner Bros. saying something like, ""If you guys want this record to reach the masses (i.e. the lowest common denominator) you're gonna have to cut out all that screaming. The suburbanites just can't be rocked from their peaceful lives."" This is an album to drive fast to, nothing more, nothing less."
5,Avenge My Sevenfold-joke,"These are my favorite bands:Green Day, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, Bloodhound Gang, HIM, cKy, Blink-182, Mudvayne, Static-X, Helltrain, Devildriver, Yellowcard, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At the Disco, Metallica, Trapt, Crossfade, Lustra, Jimmy Eat World, Korn, Hawthorne Heights, Relient K, Insane Clown Posse, Good Charlotte, Disturbed, Daniel Lioneye, The Rasmus, Box Car Racer, Coheed And Cambria, American Hi-Fi, The-All American Rejects, The 69 Eyes, Hellogoodbye, Marilyn Manson, Pantera, My Chemical Romance, Papa Roach, Pink Floyd, Simple Plan, Slayer, Styx, Sugarcult, Sum 41, System of a Down, Turbonegro, The Used, Viking Skull... and no Avenged Sevenfold-joke"
1,Just ugh...,"I must say this band went downhill pretty quickly. After Waking the Fallen these guys had made quite a name for themselves. But City of Evil is by far one of the biggest sell out cds I've seen in quite sometime. Almost the entire cd is unoriginal from their older work. This cd sounds like a bad combination of Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and Waking the Fallen. It's noticable in several tracks as well, especially since specific guitar riffs and drumbeats can be picked out that debuted in older cds. This cd is a mess, unlike their career, which skyrocketed after these guys became popular. Another band goes to the wolves."
1,Forget buying this .....Downlaod at u r own peril!!!!!!,"If i wanted to listen to this crap i d listen to an Iron Maiden album.One of the BIGGEST let downs and the worst album of the year.No song ever hits u on the first listen and belive me u wont bother listening twice.Nowhere near Waking the fallen which in my opinion is one of the better albums and a benchmark in this genre of music.Better get u r hands on the new Nevermore album ""This Godless Endeavour"" killer riffs and amazing solos."
1,O how the mighty have fallen.,"What happened? Before I continue, don't take me for some closeminded dm only fan. I love Avenged Sevenfold. Waking the Fallen is one of the greatest album's I have heard. Now, they seem like an mtv wanna-be motley crue band. I mean was it really only two summer's ago that I bought Waking the Fallen? O how the mighty fall fast. I just saw them on an mtv rock countdown along with my chemical romance, fallout boy, hawthorne heights and green day. I mean God. I have never seen a band sell-out that fast. I know their singer blew a blood vessel. He should have just quit. For the sake of the fan's and the rest of the band. I don't recommend this at all. I do recommend anything else they have done. All past work is great, enjoy."
3,2 1/2 stars,"Reasons why this cd is trash-His voice the ""Happy"" sound of the guitars and its just way way way too different than their first 2 cds. LISTEN TO WAKING THE FALLEN THIS KINDA SUX!But Beast and the Hartlet, Bat Country, Trashed and Scattered, and Seize teday are ok songs"
5,A perfect rock album,"It's rare when you find and album where you love every song on it. With City of Evil by A7X (Avenged Sevenfold) I can say that and mean it. A7X are clearly influenced by bands like Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, and GnR but they also have a unique style of their own. Most hard rock bands today don't include the blazing guitars like A7X which I think is one of their stand out qualities. If you like hard rock/metal you should definitely buy this album."
3,I Don't Want To Like It...,"When a friend told me that I would like this CD I laughed in his face. Then I listened to it. I really, REALLY did not want to like this CD. I like nothing about this band, their stupid image, their stupid names, but man oh man this CD is pretty flippin good.Many of their old fans claim they sold out because they are no longer hardcore (the singer no longer screams), but whatever. I'll take Maiden style solos anyday. Yes, this may sound like a blatant G N' R rip-off at times (""Sieze the Day"") and ""Bat Country"" got played out like crazy, but this is still better than 95% of the garbage that comes out today. It's refreshing to see a band that can put out something that thrashes than something that is just loud for the sake of being loud."
5,Whatever you guys.,"I hear so many hardcore A7X fans saying how much this album sucks, but I know it's because they're used to the emo-ish hardcore type A7X in their first 2 albums, but me personally being a more metal fan and metal-guitar fan this is the best A7X album in my opinion. Gone are the hardcore screams, and the Good Charlotte-esque melodies and choruses, and in are the classic heavy metal melodies and a more technical shred-like guitar style. Now this is more of metal than Avenged Sevenfold's old stuff, not metalcore. If you want to wish away metalcore, emo, and hardcore influences, you'll like this Avenged Sevenfold.You have to listen to ""The Wicked End"" for all you guitar fans, that dual-guitar riff in the intro and between the verse and chorus is just...well, WICKED!!"
5,i'd buy a million copies!!!!!!,man avenged sevenfold is the cd for anyone i might be 12 but i still think this cd rocks my mom is supposed to buy me this for christmas rock on!
5,AWESOME,"Having only recently discovered this band a few months ago, I am blown away by how excellent , their first major label debut album is. Im a huge GNR fan, and its been awhile since I heard a band that actually comes close to getting me as excited about thier music as Avenged Sevenfold have.There is not one cut on this album that is filler, from track 1 to the end its all killer, not filler.My hats of to this band, and hope to hear many yrs and albums , as long as they continue to rock."
3,Vocals DO make a difference.....,"The instrumental quality of this album is quite good. However, the vocals are horrible. M. Shadows went from being a powerful and versatile vocalist on WTF to nasal and annoying. Were it not for that, this would be a great album. Only if...."
3,Adequate,"Well, I got the CD and it works, but there is a huge crack on the front cover, and the inner plate is damaged."
4,"Pretty good, but not as good as Waking the Fallen","My favorite tracks on this album are M.I.A., Betrayed, Burn it Down, and Trashed and Scattered. I would put Bat Country up as a favorite but if it wasn't for my 13 year old cousin listening to this song 50 times a day on a mixed CD with 50 Cent, Fall Out Boy, The Click Five, and Green Day (American Idiot, not the old Green Day), this song might be a favorite of mine. But maybe I'm just being hard headed about not mixing genres. Whatever works for people and brings them joy and all that other good stuff."
4,A good band with mixed influences...,"I'll be honest, i have been following this band since this new album. I have heard bits of their older stuff, and it is pretty good. I do see what some people mean by the screaming. Regardless though, i think that this band is pretty cool. I like the fact that they can rub off as (but not completely are) metal. You can hear their punk influences in their first 2 songs. From then on, it is leaning more to the metal side. I think that they have a unique sound, and the screaming is truly unnecessary. What people need to do is stop categorizing them as metal, so some of these ""music, or metal fans"" can get off their case.It's a good CD. Give it a chance, and don't expect METAL!"
2,Gman,"I feel like a tough critic. But after looking at everyone's review, I guess that I'm not alone on how bad this CD is. Wow, how disappointing. I was waiting for this CD for months...very excited since ""Fallen"" is so amazing. When I heard that they were going to Warner, I was worried. After listening closely to this record, I don't think it's Warner's fault. The songs are just bad. They flow into each other. There's no character to each song. Shadows voice appears very dead. Man, I just don't what else to say."
2,Terrible change,"This album was a huge disappointment to say the least. I realize that M. Shadows hurt his throat somehow, but try letting one of the other guys do vocals along with him to give it a dual vocalist approach so there will be something other than singing the whole time. Dying Fetus uses two vocalists, and they are one of the most talented bands out there. Anyway, Beast and the Harlot is one of my favorite songs by them. It's a good opener, but then the goodness stops and never gets started again. With the exception of Bat Country (maybe), all the songs suck and sound like punk music. What happened to the metal-ish sound these guys used to have? If you like this style, then go for it. But if you're like me and you like vintage A7X, you'll stay away from this album."
3,do not appropriate,"The lyrics and themes are not appropriate for everyone but the CD itself shows ingenuity and originality. Unlike many CDs that I have purchased recently, this group has songs on the CD worth listening to."
2,I'm Bummed,I must have listened to waking the fallen 500 times fully through before retiring it to my CD case and onto my list of top 10 favorite albums. I listened to this once and gave it to my little sister so she could listen to it while she played with her barbies and easy bake oven. CD blew. I smell some Radio play in the near future. For all you Muffinlovers this will line up nicely with some Franz Fernindad or Modest Mouse on your local KROQ station. Hopefully we can expect something with a little more energy and edge to it next time.
4,1st timer,Haven't listened to Avenged before this cd. Its not normally something i would listen to but i figured that i would give them a shot...while its not something that i can say i will always listen to. It is something that i can enjoy. Obviously i'm not a hardcore Avenged Sevenfold fan or anything. So i berate or debate on how this cd sucks compared to their previous one. I just like listenting to City of Evil every now and then thats all i can say on it. A pretty decent release from the guys.
4,very different,"i want to give this 3.5 stars, but i gave it 4 because avenged sevenfold is an awsome band.i knew this cd wouldnt have as much screaming(which they are very good at) as waking the fallen, but i thought there might be some. there isnt. thats disapointing.its also the only drawback to this cd. its good once you get used to it."
1,I'M APULLED,THIS ALBUM DISAPPOINTS ME. I'M AN AVENGED SEVENFOLD FAN AND HEREING THIS ALBUM REALLY SUCKS. WHERE THE HELLS THE SCREAMS? AND IT JUST DOSEN'T INTREST ME. IF YOU WANT GOOD AVENGED SEVENFOLD BUY WAKING THE FALLEN ITS HELL OF A LOT BETTER THEN THIS CRAP.
1,holy crap,"this is disgusting. its the worst cd i've ever bought. waking the fallen was amazing, the public should never have had to listen to this atrocity. without a doubt, the most dissapointing cd i've bought in the last few years. the vocals made me want to cry. if you mostly listen to heavier music than this (the red chord, into the moat, meshuggah), you are going to hate this with a passion. avenged was my guilty pleasure until this. i am ashamed to say that i used to like this band."
1,WOW SUPER BUG LET DOWN,"I'm going to start off by saying ""waking the fallen"" is prob one of my favorite punk/hardcore records of all time, and with that said I can say ""City of Evil"" is one of the biggest letdowns ever, it's also one of worst cds I now have in my collection.Mind you the music all around is great, but WOW when shadows starts to sing I wanted to cry, his damaged voice should have never been put on this alblum.It sucks he injured his vocal cords, but Avenged Sevenfold should have never recorded this record, and let down countless A7F fans.Get a NEW singer or have shadows do the clean vocals and someone else do the screams, something other then this trash!!Listen to samples before buying.........or find yourself crying :("
1,In agreeance with the musical doctor as well..,"The aforementioned musical doctor is correct in his esteemed analysis of ""A7X"". It has also been scientifically proven by the doctor's followup work that, ""Allow me to amend it: nobody with a mental age above 14 likes Avenged Sevenfold."""
1,Ouch.,"Really isn't all that fantastic of an album. It's just more pop-metal nastiness mostly. Vocals are nasily, yes I know he got surgery, but that doesn't mean the whole band has to change. The guitar work wasn't all the impressive either, let alone the drumming. You want metal? (Though Avenged Sevenfold is hardly metal)Listen to Mastodon or Lamb of God. Much more worth it, those are some boys with talent. Cheers!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is typical MTV music. It is not METAL!!!!!!!!!!!! It is for all of the mallcore losers out there that do not know what real metal is!!!!!!! This band is garbage.
1,rock and roll dudes!!!!!!,"this is rock and roll and its really darn good, rock and roll dude this is good rock music. rock on Dudes!! there really hardcore more than metallica but they cant be more hardcore than good charlotte they are the harecorest of the hardcore so if you wanna be like this retard below me then be my guess and rock on dude! because i love rock and roll because it is good dude music ROCK ON DUDES!! DUDE ITS ROCK MAN, ROCK ON DUDES!!!"
1,THIS IS SUPPOSED TO REVIVE METAL?!?!,"Forget it! This is just some crappy metalcore mixed with some guitar solos. Despite having guitar solos, they suck and the guitarist is no match for Kerry King, Adrian Smith, or K.K. Downing. The drums are a bunch of noise but that's what you expect in metalcore, A LOT OF NOISE!!! If you want an awesome old-school album in 2005, pick up ""Angel of Retribution"" by Judas Priest. Avenged Sevenfold weren't awful before this album but now MTV ruined it and we're hearing this metalcore trash go mainstream!"
2,couldn't rate it any higher...............,"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A 3 AND A HALF STAR, BUT THAT LEAD SINGER HAS GOT TO GO. IN FACT I FOUND MYSELF SKIPPING THROUGH PARTS OF SONGS THAT I WOULD NORMALLY HAVE LISTENED TO BUT THE SINGERS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO HAVE A BOWEL MOVEMENT IN PARTS. I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THE GUITARISTS PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS. BUT THE BEST PART WAS GUITAR SOLOS, THAT'S RIGHT YOU REMEMBER THOSE DON'T YOU? OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THESE GUYS, GET RID OF THE VOCALS AND YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD BAND HERE!................ Well sorry but I just saw the video for bat country and now I know why I gave these guys a two star. They look like emo vampires or something! Or I guess if you wanted to be funnier you could just say they look like GOOD CHARLOTTE!"
2,You know a band sucks when they change their tune this fast,"Before they used to growl and now they make radio freindly pop metal. That tell's you that this bands lacks an identity and will sell out to anything. Bat Country is one of the few songs in this album that sounds somewhat good but, it appears to be a fluke since everything else in this album sucks."
2,What Happened?,Ok the musicianship is defaintly there for the most part but what the heck happened to the vocals. They really got annoying on this album. Defaintly not another Waking The Fallen. Now I say this listening to Coheed and Cambria who have even more high pitched vocals then on this album. But the difference with Coheed is that Coheed's vocals work with the musicianship on their albums. This album however it just doesn't work for me. I give it a two because there's still a load of talent within the musicianship.
3,it's ok I guess,"A7X is musically one of the best bands around right now, and this really shows through on this album. There are two things about City of Evil that bother me. First is the vocals. No, I'm not mad that Matt can't/won't scream anymore. When he actually sang on WTF he sounded awesome, and when I heard that he would be singing on this album, I expected him to sing like on WTF and was actually excited about that. However, he seems to be channeling Axl Rose, which is not good. A lot of it also sounds like Velvet Revolver. Second, the lyrics in many places are really cheesy, and sometimes I actually feel embarrassed for Matt that he is singing such silliness. I still like A7X, will continue to go to their shows, and will buy their next album. I just hope that they get over this phase of trying to revive the 1980s, and that Matt (who has a lot of talent) will find his own singing style instead of copying has-beens from 20 years ago."
5,Genius!,"This album displays a7x evolving into a band that goes beyond genre labeling. Musically they have matured and are showing the world that they are ""musicians"" and not just some cookie cutter hardcore/metal/insert your label band. I am a bit disappointed by the vocals (not enough GRR RAH!), but it is still a great performance. This should definitely be in your collection."
2,gross,"too poppy for their own good.. I couldn't take it after hearing 2 songs off this album. Not to say that they are bad musicians, because they aren't, just ew"
2,Has a few good moments but metal saviors? hardly!,"Ok I'll hit you with the bad news first. 1. This band is not metal! when your main influence is Guns N Roses that doesn't make you metal. 2. Some of the worst singing I've ever heard in my life. I'm not into the whole clean vocal thing but jesus if you are going to sing make sure you can sing. It's like taking the most monotone tone deaf person in the world making him hold his nose and giving him a microphone! 3. The guitar playing is good but it's not great because i feel like they aren't used to the fullest extent of their abilities. Now the good 1. The guitar playing that's about it. If you are into hard rock i reccomend you dowload beast and the harlot, trashed and scattered, and seize the day but don't waste your money on the whole cd because the rest of it is complete crap. BTW I heard a sample of these guys covering walk by pantera (one of my favorite songs) and they completely butchered it. Dimebag Darrell is rolling over in his grave."
2,blaaa,"I really liked their other releases, they seem to be less polished. all the songs on this cd start out strong and then end up going into the same repetitive riffs that make up this cd, fast solos and powerchords. listen there are so many other good bands out right now, like, soilwork,threat signal,mudvayne,killswitch engage and my favorite band of all time, MASTODON. now theres a band whos music is exciting to listen too. i guess im getting tired of all these repetitive sounding bands, im looking for more bands like Mastodon, who are trying to do more original music, not just trying to sell cds."
3,what happened?,"Man has Avenged Sevenfold changed. They were much more brutal and hardcore with ""sounding the seventh trumpet"", my first A7X CD that I bought like 2 years ago, it was awesome. Then I bought Waking the Fallen, another amazing CD backed by powerful vocals that you can really rock out to and you can listen to the CD over and over and still be amazed. They were one of my top 5 bands, but with their latest release ""city of evil"" they became sell outs, their are no hardcore screams of any sort and M. Shadows turned into some sort a pussy with his at times annoying, nasaly, whiny singing. Unless you are new to the band and only heard of the band because they sold out with the bat country video, you will be disappointed from their previous work. But I must admit their are some really good guitar solos on this album, too bad the band had to turn to mainstream with their sound, they were amazing, it saddens me."
3,Weak,"Upon hearing this, my first impression is that it's a weaksauce version of Megadeth. Seriously. It's just another of those new, generic, ""metal"" bands that seem to be popping up every so often. While it's not really BAD per se, it does have a lack of distinguishing traits and creativity that make a good band."
4,A GREAT ALUBUM BY A GREAT BAND.,"This was a great C.D. Track one(beast and the harlot) is introducing Shadows new vocals. Bat country,beast and the harlot , burn it down are my favorite. sieze da day has a great solo(alotta songs do) it is a sad song. over all a great album, definatly worth da $.(P.S. Did u know that da beggining of Bat country, he who makes a beast of himself is free from the pain of being a man."
3,"Not bad.........if you never heard ""Waking The Fallen""","There are a few interesting and heavy melodic aspects on the album. A7X widen there sound but fall short of any real substance. I also believe the album is way over produced and overall the songs lack any bite. As you might have read M. Shawdows had vocal chord surgery last year cause he damaged the chords so bad. Now he sounds like a whiny Scott Weiland and a weak John Corabi mixed together. I hate the tone that he is using. This is so very unfortunate for the band 'cause I felt like they really had something going on. Really want to appreciate the band pick up 'WTF"" right now. You will hear how powerful M. shawdows voice once was. Think of an even balance of Phil Anselmo and General Mke Patton!"
3,not what i expected,"i dont want to be ""one of those guys"" who always says the older stuff was better, but i have tired to listen to this cd the whole way through 3 times so i could get a good feel and i havent been able to make it. i have been a fan for a while sounding the 7th trumpet is fantastic, but i really feel they hit the nail on the head with waking the fallen. so buying this cd i didnt even listen to any songs first, and upon first play of the cd, the music is cool pretty much the same, with some definate different changes with some of the softer more melodic (seize the day?) songs but there is not near enough growling, not the same mix of vocals from the first 2 cds. i know bands change become more mature, but i had expectations for this cd and they fell short, if this had been a new band i probably would have given it 4 stars but with A7X i just had higher hopes.I would call this more of a rock ablum then a hardcore album..."
3,Hmmm what to say. 3.99 stars,"This CD isnt bad but it's doesnt live up to walken the fallen which is pretty much a masterpiece. One thing I've noticed is that when bands change (sell out) 99% of the time its for the worst. Hence S.T.P., Sugar Ray, and of course Metallica theres more too. Take Slayer for instance they really haven't changed much and they still kick ass after what 20yrs.The fisrt time I heard this disk I was like WTF? What happened? Then I listened to it again and it started to get better. This CD has grown on me but its still not a 5 star. I have to disagree and say this isnt the biggest let down as one of the other reviewers said. The biggest let down ever was ""Saint Anger"" what a pile of GARBAGE. I think that they should get someone to scream and yell for Shadows. Beacause without that it seems like they sold out. It's still is A7X just without screaming and yelling and a slight bit mellower."
3,they messed it up,"People reviewing this beat me to it. The band messed up. bad. Who told the singer that he could actually sing. He must understand that his voice only sounded good in CONTRAST to the damn screaming, and of, course, he no longer screams. Other reviewers have already said it. Wait for the next album, hope they get this message. I loved their other two albums but I can't imagine anyone liking this."
2,"An OK CD, but not the A7X I loved...","OK, so they won awards for this album, but to me that's proof that the public eats up anything that gets radio play. Honestly, it's the worst of their three albums. I mean they simply sold out with this album. I'll admit to liking it a little. There are some good song, but there is no edge to them anymore. To quote a friend ""They went from being Iron Maiden clones to Guns and Roses clones."" That pretty much sums up A7X for me. They have never been super innovative with their music, but at least with SOTST and Waking the Fallen they had mostly interesting tracks. City of Evil is simply another nauseating nu-metal album. The only great tracks on this album would have to be M.I.A. and Betrayed(which is a tribute to Dimebag Darrel). The rest of them just blend in with all the other stuff that pollutes the airwaves."
2,Wow! What the hell happened,"Yes. I'm going to do it. Compare it to their independent label(Hopeless Records) effort. ""Waking the Fallen"" was one of the most influential and original records of 2003.A perfect mix of harmony and brutality combined with precise songwriting and guitar riffs.Excellent. Now we have this.Okay I know this guy messed up his voice or what not but half of this album doesn't even sound like Avenged Sevenfold.They remind you of a really gay emo band for about half of the record. When they really do try they manage to rock you out. I personally liked ""Blinded in Chains"" a whole lot. Also ""The Wicked End"" has a cool like Movie type symphonic interlude in the middle. I like maybe three more songs on this album but the rest of it blows.I do respect them for not kicking their singer out just because he couldn't scream. This is loyalty and not many bands would do that.I was just dissapointed I didn't get an excellent metal record like I expected. Oh well!"
2,bah,"I think avenged listened to a little too much maiden lately since album sounds like a really really crappy version of maiden cds. The first few seconds of Beast and the Harlot are really good, sounds like they got heavier and the drummer became way better but then it all goes down hill when the chorus comes in. Also, the singer sucks ass here, he does no range whatsoever, everything is very half ass high pitched. WTF was amazing but it seems as if they can't pull that off twice."
4,City of Evil delivers on multiple levels,"I'm not going to go in-depth with this review, but I will say that this is one of the more unique rock records to grace my presence in quite some time. Each song has it's own unique qualities about it, whether it be amazing guitar solos, incredible drumming, a mixture of both, or just a great song period. This band isn't your typical rock band with riff after riff after riff; this is a band that knows how to rock out with a variety that will leave you wondering what's going to happen next.This album, I guarantee, isn't for everybody. However, if you want an album with a wide array of different melodies, and you just want a good rock album, then this is your CD!"
2,Trying Too Hard To Be Cool . . .,"""Bat Country"" just loads it all on but is ultimately empty . . . I like music that ranges from the heaviest Death (try HUMAN) to the mellowist ambient but the music still has to be good and I just don't hear any great songs on this album.These guys brag about how they want unlimited access to $, drugs and trim. At least they're honest, but I can't say that I'm impressed.At least their tattoos are cool. ""Gee, I'm a loser, but if I get a tattoo, THEN I'll be cool! . . . The more tattoos I get, the cooler I'll be!!!"" ---------- LOOO-SERS!"
2,"ugh, wut?","ok, avenged sevenfold started of with 2 amazing albums!!!! 5 stars to both!!! then, this atrocity came along, and shattered everyones dreams and hopes. ya, sure, the lead singer had a surgury on his throat and he cant scream anymore, but that doesnt change the fact that they sound stupid as hell now!! i have no sympathy!! and its not just the vocals, everything we all once knew and loved that was A7X is gone! and for good!!!! so rememebr what they once where, and try not to grimace to much at what they've become."
5,This is Great Metal Music,"I'm 46 and my wife is 52. She doesn't care for 'screamo' metal bands and she wasn't down with the the other two A7X albums.When I played this she was amazed. The new style of vocals really appealed to her AND TO ME!. I LOVE THIS ALBUM.It's a bit Metallica, some-what Iron Maiden; the vocals are a bit like Queen (says the wife) or someone I just can't nail down.Doesn't matter. This and Wolfmother are my fave albums of new tunes so far this year.Eagles of Death Metal is #3!"
2,"great guitar work, BUT.....",THe guitar work is great! Something a lot of new metal bands seem to lack. BUT the guy that sings has one of the most annoying voices and vocal styles I have ever heard!!!!! If they got a different singer they could be a really great band
1,Avenged Sevenfold Sucks,"People say this crap is ""bringing an older sound to a new generation.."", ha, my arse. This is just emo turned up a little bit and made more gothic. Avenged Sevenfold sucks."
1,This band was never good,"[...]The singer tries to sound ""power metal"", but ends up sounding like he has a cold(for a good nasal singer, listen to any of Mike Patton's bands). The guitarists still play repetitive riffs, but now they have ""borrowed"" solos from better guitarists like Slash or the late Dimebag Darrel. The bass is still undetectable, and the drumming is generic. Don't be fooled into thinking this is metal!"
1,Wow...(no stars),"I love all styles of music, but this... wow. Bought it after all the great reviews I read about this being the future of hard rock. It sounds like a Limp Bizkit cover band decided they were into Jon Bon Jovi and Guns 'N' Roses, changed styles but didn't have the chops. The ""heavy"" parts of this CD sound contrived, if you've heard any metal album in the last 20 years, you've heard all there is to be offered here. The ""melodic"" parts and solos sound like they were copied note-for-note by an ice cream truck. Overall, this is a bad hybrid of Bon Jovi and King Diamond; basically a re-hash of the past 20 years of hard rock/heavy metal, but without any fire, passion, or good execution to make it essential, or even worthwhile."
1,Horrible,"I'm a metal fan, and I bought this album because it got so many glowing reviews, many of which compared this band to Slayer and early Metallica. As a hardcore fan of both of those bands, I gave Avenged Sevenfold a try. And I'm here to tell you-- it's absolute crap. I couldn't stand to listen to it, although I tried. Comparing it to Slayer or Metallica is an absolute insult. It sounds like David Bowie lyrics being obnoxiously screamed by a bunch of spastic teenagers who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. Like most music fans, I have a lot of CDs in my collection that I'm lukewarm on... but THIS was a CD I knew I would NEVER listen to again. I sent it back to Amazon, and they were nice enough to give me a partial refund even though I had taken it out of the plastic.Obviously there are quite a few people who like this band, and to each his own... but as a classic heavy metal fan, I have to say that Avenged Sevenfold gets two thumbs down from me."
2,Sell out?,"This CD is completely horrible. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the actual music part of the album is strong. The vocals are weak, and the band is only a shadow of their former selves. This is a terrible follow up to Waking the Fallen, which was an extremely well written album. So if you like A7X's previous albums, this will be a total waste. They're now just a hardcore band turned mainstream. (No screaming on the whole album, how is that hardcore?)"
2,What happened?,"It sounds like they got one of the kids from ""High School Musical"" to fill in on lead vocals on this CD and it really gets on your nerves over time. I give it 2 stars just because the guitar work is pretty good. Otherwise, don't bother."
2,Not as good as their first two albums...,"A.S's first two albums were brilliant, harcore metal compilations of powerful riffs and screamo vocals. Howeevr after hearing this i've gathered that they've gone for a more 'punk' style, which sadly isn't for me. :("
1,Garbage,I found this book both insulting and a waste of time. I read it ony because of the hype on the media behind the whole Tookie circus.
1,Yeah- Right,"I was forced to read this idiot's garbage years ago and yeah I was a kid then, too. It was just as ridiculous then as it now that people are under the assumption that kids will go out and commit atrocities because we didn't read these kinds of books. You know what, I don't go around shooting people for $100 in their register because I already knew that was wrong. I don't need someone telling me that a life in gangs is difficult and wrong path to take- because I already had my self-esteem and knowledge of what is right and wrong. I learned that from my brothers. Parents and family members- Stop wasting your cash on garbage like this and start talking to each other. It makes more of a differnce than reading it in some lame book written by a criminal."
4,Mieko and the Fifth treasure,In this well written multicultural book we get a glimpse of what life was like in Japan after the bombing of Nagasaki. Eleanor Coerr gives us a feel for the times and we can learn a lot about the culture of the Japanese people. A very inspiring story that makes us all want to look inside and find our fifth treasure.
4,A good book about teen death,"I just read this book, after ordering it for my classroom (I like to preview what's in my classroom library before making it available). This book hits the nail on the head: How do teens go on with their lives when one of their friends dies?This story hit close to home for me, since I lost a good friend while in high school...and we were in a car accident together, just like the characters in this book. I lived, he didn't. Like Trisha, I had to accept the fact that accidents happen and sometimes not everyone lives. We all make mistakes, it's just how you work through them that makes you a better, stronger person and helps you to grow.I can't think of a better book that deals with all of the emotions and quesitons that teens face when a peer dies. This author definitely knows her stuff and I would gladly recommend this book (and most of her others) to the teens in my classroom. It is high on detail (the senory details in the accident scene were excellent) and content."
5,A must read for young and old.,"This book reveals many emotions from laughter to tears. This book shows the true meaning of friendship and how to survive the loss of a dear friend. As well as, how to stand by your disabled friends. A fiction but so true to life."
4,A Great Book For Friends To Read,I thought this was a good book for friends to read together. It showed how much you would miss a friend if they died. It also showed the meaning of friendship and loyalty. If you and a friend are looking for a book to read together this would be an awesome book to choose.
4,Not By The Box,"I really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from Meiji. The chocolate has a great, and not too sweet, taste. The nuts are a bit small, if you are used to larger varieties, but that is a small problem.I found they were not good for my feeding frenzies. Stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea, as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat. Taken at a more leisurely pace, they are a real treat."
1,I guess it goes down the same way anyhoe,"I got this product ship one day express. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I opened it, all I saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with LITTLE macadamia nuts in the center of the holders."
2,Mostly Incorrect,"I was excited to get this book to learn the B-side songs I didn't know, and hopefully correct some things I may have been playing wrong.Unfortunately, when I got the book I was surprised to find that many of the tabs were blatantly wrong, and not even just the solo parts. I learned many of the songs by ear more correctly than this book had them. And I know I'm playing them more correctly because I can tell by live videos as well as common sense that this book is wrong in many ways on almost every song.So I would really only recommend this book if you really can't learn by ear and have no idea whatsoever how to play the songs. And even then, only use the book as a basic guide."
3,pretty but isn't as readable as it states,"I have to angle it to see the time as the coating darkens the face a bit. Can't see the date in its little window without a magnifying glass! So not as readable as they promote. But it is a pretty watch, reasonably priced--so I kept it."
4,No it Is not easy to read.,"This watch is attractive, but the clasp design is hard to open and close and as I said it is not easy to read.Really liked the method of adjusting the watch band."
5,Marvelous,We LOVE this poster. We took it to be framed and it's incredible. Had a thin red matte and a thicker black matte and a thick plain black frame mounted and it's beautiful! The thin red matte really brings out the red glass.
4,A tale of two worlds.,"I bought this CD in 2005 and thought it was weird how it went from rock to electronica. Then I realized, the CD is split between Jimmy's (Jesse Eisenberg) world and Ellie's (Christina Ricci). Jimmy's is young-male rock, which makes up the first half. The last half is Ellie's, with its entertainment-industry club electronica. It's a pretty brilliant attempt at a soundtrack, which doesn't just throw songs on there for the sake of it. I prefer Ellie's world, as it's more atmospheric. Overall, it's a well-rounded album that I've enjoyed for the past 8 years."
3,Ghoul Music?,"CD is okay, could have used more horror inspired bands. Horror-industrial rocker Rob Zombie/White Zombie would have been a good choice for the flick as well as The Misfits, The Cramps or The Young Werewolves, even though they are more of a new school horrorbilly band."
2,Cursed Soundtrack,"I had the oportunity to listen this CD, but I am totally dissapointed, only I save four songs, the other songs are really painful, techno and stuff.I like the son by Bowling for Soup, Lil' Red Riding Hood, is cool."
5,Very Fun!,We love playing this game and it is a nice version of the originial Monopoly. Especially if you are a Notre Dame fan :)
4,Useful design information,"Passive Circuits Design by Ian Sinclair is a good book that shows a lot of insight into how electrical components behave in the real world. Reading the section of the book explaining how capacitors behave was the most useful to me so far.I found one error on page 194 Cell Origins. The book explains that the cathode is the negative terminal and anode the positive terminal, this is wrong because from other references that I have checked. In Electro-chemical cells the anode is the negative terminal where oxidation takes place. The Cathode is the positive terminal where reduction takes place.The book covers a lot of information including a primer on CAD and some information on computer hardware I/O ports.All in all it is a good book filled with practical information"
5,Fender Rumble 100 1X15 Combo,"Great amp for the money i have other amps, but i use this one for my playing out.I have a half stack and a full stack,but this is my main amp.It' a little heavy but easier to move than the stacks, and gives me all the boom i need.I just bought another one ,now i've got two of them..paid 100. used. Can't beat the boom for the bucks...."
4,"Well crafted, and produced high energy metal.","This is the third (their seventh) album I have heard from Grave Digger. The other two were their first ""Heavy Metal Breakdown"" and third ""War Games"". To me, Grave Digger concentrate on getting great riffs similar in vein to Accept (Restless and Wild era) and combining them with big choruses and will crafted solos. The result is great music which is generally fast in pace but not thrash. From these albums I have heard the progression is definitely going in the right direction with the music getting more mature and slightly more intricate and the production getting better with the music alwways being kept well heavy and fast. The only criticism would be the vocals which are very German and hard to make out, but can be forgiven as the singer is the reason the band exist and without him this great music would not exist. Like fast riffy metal? BUY!"
4,Great for beginners,"...--This book is geared to the beginner that has no expierance in Tattooing. It gives a lot of information that would otherwise take you a while to figure out. However a book does not take the place of a good insructor, find someone who is willing to give you hands on expieriance in the art of Tattooing. Also if you have been Tattooing for a while, and never had any real or formal training, you will find this book very helpful. But remember Tattooing is Medic-classified as Minor Skin Surgery, and you can really hurt somone if it is done incorrectly. Check out moderntattooscience.com for some info on tattooing."
5,I have over 16 years of tattooing experience.,This book is a tattooing bible. Everything you want to know about how to tattoo is covered in this book.
2,msg fish food,"this stuff has MSG in it, but fry do eat it. i dont mean to be a health freak for my fish but i'd rather find something else that doesn't damage my fish's health. and if you plan on eathing your fish, like my tilapia, then i surely do not want to use it."
5,I Love these,These are one of the best product to feed my fry! They grow quicker and healhier using this product. Highly recommend these for all fry!
3,"angelfish fry eat it, but don't thrive","i've tried this product with three batches of new angelfish fry, both alone and in combination with other foods. the fry will eat it for the most part, but they don't go crazy for it. also, i don't believe first bites to offer the full nutritional value that angelfish fry require. i was feeding this food exclusively to my most recent batch of fry for their first three days of eating, until they stopped eating it altogether and i had to switch to another food.i think first bites makes a decent supplement to a diet consisting mainly of bbs, but don't expect to grow angelfish fry on this product alone."
2,Plating something in silver doesn't make it valuable,"The Doctor and Ace are attending a jazz performance when the Doctor pocket watch alarm goes off. He has set it to remind himself of something - but what? Something important as a number of people converge on Windsor - a group of Nazis, a sorceress from the 17th century, and the Cybermen...This story is a bit over-packed with opponents, and features an attempt to make the Doctor more mysterious again, and so sadly ends up being confusing and frustrating. The main problem is that not very much happens, and we keep getting hinted at that there is more than meets the eye.From my reading, scratching the surface just reveals even more surface. A bit of waste of time and effort."
5,George Williams and his Orchestra,"Given the period that the original recordings were done, the quality of the tracks on this CD is absolutely incredible. I had not heard of George Williams until a friend played it for me and I was just knocked out by the clear uncluttered arrangements of the tunes and the fresh approach he had to the many standards on the disc. As an arranger who does transcribing this CD is a dream come true."
2,Not Very Quiet,I purchased this case with the hope that it would be very quiet as promised. However - this is simply not true. It's not a loud case - but it's not really any more quiet than any other case.I think the main problem is the two huge fans on the system - one is mounted on the top of the case and is particularly loud. There are settings for the fans (HIGH - MEDIUM - LOW) and it is still pretty noisy at low.(BTW - I also have a fanless power supply on this case)Maybe liquid cooled is the only way to go...
3,design problem,"Great iron while it works. Major problem is burst of steam and spray buttons push a plunger that allows water to either go to steam or spray. The housing of the plunger is thin plastic and cracks. This allows water to leak inside the iron and drip out on clothing. This is annoying and probably a safety issue. I tried to fix cracked plunger housings to no avail. Since is is now out of warranty, hardly worth trouble and expense of having fixed. Until this design problem is fixed, I would find another iron."
4,Great iron,"After researching and reading other reviews, I decided to purchase this iron. This iron is awesome. It has lots and lots of steam and it just glides over whatever you are ironing. It also cuts down on ironing time since you only have to go over item once. The only drawback is that water tank is small and I have to refill every morning."
2,Pulled up lame,"The first 5-6 months were great: excellent heat distribution, terrific steam. After that, the steam feature began to give me trouble. Was always having to 'prime' the mechanism, even though I don't have hard water. In the 8th month, this gave up the ghost. Steam output just plain stopped.Designwise, this is a somewhat unwieldy model. The water line is difficult to see, and the handle tilt made ironing often uncomfortable.I'm giving this a 2 rating because for 5 months, the steam & heat features were a dream. It really deserves an F/0 for failing to survive a year. Overpriced. Underperformed."
1,hosed by reviews...again,every time I buy a product based on reviews I get screwed. Why doesnt this iron have a manual shut off switch??? I got this iron for my girlfriend and although she wont go out and say it I dont think she likes it. She complained that theres no way to wrap the cord around the handle side of the iron. Im just mad because it blinks all day long when its plugged in. I have a degree in engineering but for some reason I cant understand this iron.on the plus side it does iron clothes. ehh.
2,"Too havy, uselessly too big","Too hevy, too big. Overextended bottom makesit hard to see the surface. Thermostat control slideris not crisp and covers dots that indicate setting.T-Fal traded usability for slick look."
5,The Chrysler Building,A wonderful show. It was very interesting and educational. I really enjoy programs of that type. Thanks for making the DVD available.
3,Great content; very poor format,"Wish I had read through all the reviews before purchasing - it never occurred to me ANY Bible - Old or New Testament - would be presented without an index/table of contents to link to each book. Rather, as noted by another reviewer - good luck finding any Chapter/Verse. This was my first New Testament twenty years ago - I still have a dog-eared (actually dog chewed!) copy right here and it has been an excellent companion - however, unless I am missing something, the format makes it extremely difficult. I would say buy the hardcopy - look for something else for the Kindle."
2,Kindle Users Beware,All of the other reviews are based on print editions of this book. I downloaded this on my Kindle and the navigation is poor at best. Typing in a specific verse does nothing - you have to either 1) search for the book you're looking for and weed through the search results or 2) go to the table of contents and page through several pages until you find the chapter and verse you want. Not a good experience - I will stick to my regular Bible!
3,Multiple orders,"Ordering 10 for gifts is a challenge. Order was broken up and the first delivery listed 3 on the invoice, but only 2 in the package. The remaining items have come in one or two at time and the credit card company placed a hold on the card due to the unusual billing. The missing item was resent and received and I now have a complete order, however, I may have missed an email confirming the order and could be charged for the missing item. If I had it to do over, I would try a book store.Good thing I like this version, the Master Outlines are awesome!"
4,Very good tool for Christian growth and follow-up,"I have been using this handy little New Testament (in both KJV and NIV) for many years. The Master Outlines are straight out of the biblical texts quoted and arranged in a very logical and helpful manner. This is especially true when using this New Testament as a follow-up tool with new Christian believers. I have also found, from those that I give this to, that the small size does not ""feel"" awkward, say when a new believer opens his/her lunch at work and pulls out this Bible to follow the lesson for the day. The questions from co-workers start flying, but this New Testament is not overwhelming, like a new complete study Bible might be or a separate Bible study book or booklet to go along with a Bible."
3,NOT leather,"I searched everywhere in the description for a material content. I even went to the Saddlenam website hoping they would explain. Since it said ""leather"" and didn't say it wasn't leather I had to assume it was. I am dissapointed to spend this much money and find not even the center section is leather. The title is deceptive and then nowhere does it say they are actually made of vinyl and polyester. BEWARE!"
5,Amazing,"I'm amazed with the customer service I received. I order a seat cover, and I received in within 5 days. The Seat cover is in excellent condition and it fits like a glove.I would strongley recommend this seller."
3,Decent Camera for the Price,"Overall, this camera takes great pictures, with a wide choice of pic sizes and resolutions. The software and USB interface were flawless to setup and easy to use.I have just a few gripes, despite the low price...1. There is no lens cover. Even though the recessed lens should be safe from damage, a lens cover would be nice.2. The flash takes 5 to 8 seconds to recharge, even with fresh batteries. This seems excessive to me.3. The quality of the image on the viewscreen is not great, but use of the viewscreen should be limited anyway, to preserve battery life.Still, this camera is an excellent choice for the casual picture taker."
1,don't buy this junk!,I received the camera two weeks ago and return it two days later. The camera's LCD is not clear at all and cannot view subjects clearly. It is not worth a hessle!
5,Best Buy for the Price,"I started to look for a digital camera for my kids for quite some time. I would like them to learn to compose by taking pictures without spending all the money on films. Toshiba PDR-M21 is a very reasonable beginner's camera. The picture (default: normal 1600x1200) give excellent graphics. At the time I bought this camera, it came with a bonus 32-MB memory card that further adds to its already great value.As for the driver, I have no difficulty downloading the latest driver for WindowXP ... The graphic software is a piece of cake to operate."
3,Never did get this one to work.,"After 2 days of trying to install this camera on my computer, I gave up and bought something else.I'm using Windows XP and apparently the driver disk that this camera comes with does not support XP. So I went on Toshiba's website and downloaded the necessary patch for XP, but it STILL wouldn't work - I would get a message that it could not find my camera.After calling and e-mailing Toshiba tech support, I still didn't get the camera to work with my computer.I was, however, pleased with the camera itself. The LCD screen was very clear and setup of the camera itself was easy. The function button on the back is a little clumsy and too easy to touch during regular operation.From the sounds of it - this is a great camera, just beware if you're running Windows XP."
1,Not worth the price,"I had to return the camera twice, first because the view finder is crooked and second it does not take clear pictures. I had a HP 1.3 megaplex camera before and it took better pictures."
4,Intriguing,"This is a welcome dollop of Corelli. The Op. 1 Sonatas on the first CD are disappointing. They are uninteresting melodically and harmonically. The later works on the remaining 3 CDs are much better. They are decidedly modern sounding in their harmonic adventurousness, and often recall Corelli's brilliant concerti grossi. The performances are quite worthy. The violinists posess a good tone and solid technique, while the cellist is an absolute delight in the occasional passages where he is allowed to shine. The CDs were recorded in different locales each, but the sound, despite differences between the CDs, is always clear and engaging. I will be sampling the last 3 CDs from time to time, which seems to me the best way to appreciate this particular recording."
2,Disappointed,Viedo excellent but audio reminds of early cold digital sound. I'm use to lp sound and my other blu ray operas are more than satisfactory.
2,Worked great for 1 week,"Received the item for Christmas, read the entire user guide before plugging it in, and, after pre-charging the recommended time, I began using it on December 27. Worked great until January 3, at which time, when I picked it up to brush before bed, it would not stay on after pressing the power button. Nothing in the product literature describes this problem. Now, I'll have to try to contact the company, probably ship it somewhere, etc., etc., etc."
1,Broke before I got a chance to use it!,"This is the best toothbrush you can buy, however, after one week it began to radomly turn on and off - all by itself. I called the company and asked for a new one, which they refused to do. I sent it for repair and the box was returned - MOVED!"
2,what's hype about this useless toothbrush,"this is completely usesless toothbrush. I feel it never cleans my teeth. I need to spend 4 minutes to get my teeth ""clean"". This is something no money worth. Consider varity of toothbrush out there, this isn't a good choice."
5,Best Toothbrush Ever and excellent customer service!!,"This is the best toothbrush I have ever used! I had tons of dental work done 3 years ago, despite my brushing 3x's a day and flossing regularly. I got the brush 18 months ago and have had no dental problems at all. When I went in for a cleaning my dentist asked me why I was there, he said I had no plaque at all. He could not believe that I had not had a cleaning in the past year. The brush just quit working recently and sonicare sent me a new one free of charge. They said peroxide toothpaste is not good for the handle. The best customer service ever!!"
3,Brush heads were not advertised properly,"I love the Sonicare toothbrush (this is our second), but this QP-3 is not advertised correctly. It says it comes with two brushheads, and shows a standard size head in the ad. However, one of the heads is extremely small, sub compact, which we can't use comfortably."
5,GIve this one a chance and you will LOVE the results!,"At first trying the sonic tootbrush I thought...wow..this is strange....but soon discovered an unbelievable clean and fresh feeling that I could only get at my dentists' office. It stimulates the lips and gums too, making you face feel good!. I also love the feel of the handle. The timed beeps are great to remind me that I needed to switch to different areas of my teeth. It takes a little getting used to the sensation, but I would say ...give it a chance and you'll be sold!"
5,No need to floss...,This is a MUCH better toothbrush than any manual toothbush out there (you simply can't compare...) better than the Colgate Actibrush and even better than Oral-B Plak Control.No need to floss anymore ... because this brush does it all...I have sensitive gums yet I feel no discomfort using it.I think this is the best brush you can get - trust me!
5,Can't live without it!,"This is one of those things which you think is completely a waste of money or just a novelty gadget if you have not tried it, but you just cant imagine what life was without it once you have it. This toothbrush is just great. It gives me that ""after-the-dentist-cleaning-feeling"" every time I finish brushing my teeth. Those hard to clean areas behind your teeth are easily cleaned with this toothbrush. But it could be a lot easier if the brush head were angled though, which I think sonicare have with their new Sonicare Elite line. I didnt buy the Elite because it costs about 40 dollars more, but looking back, It would have been well worth it. But the advance model is still great, and now I cant live without it."
5,Brighter smile,"When I was reading the customer reviews at Amazon, I thought that Sonicare is paying its employees to write positive reviews. But the toothbrush really works--it leaves your mouth fresh and clean. One disadvantage, and dentists will disagree, is that after using Sonicare you cannot stand your teeth without brushing them after each meal--you get addicted to the cleanness of your mouth."
3,An average book on Swing...,"At first I was really excited about reading this book. I have several books from the WROX publishers, and for the most part I have found them to be very high above average in their ability to explain their topics in a very deep manner. While I do not think that this book covers Swing very deeply, I still believe that it is a good book for learning the concepts of Swing. Since reading this book I have read other books on Swing (Java Swing by O'Reilly for instance), and I have found that most of them seem to go into a lot more detail than this book. Another thing that I would have liked to have seen in this book would have been more emphasis on different design paradigms (MVC, model-delegate, etc). Design was mentioned, but not as deeply as I was looking for. Overall though, I suppose that it can be difficult to get just the right mix of UI design and API coverage."
5,very clean,"this is a very clean book for being used, and was packaged where it did not get damaged in shipment."
1,Continuing education credit no longer available,CERPS from IBLCE are no longer available for these modules. Please check with Jones and Bartlett Publishers for more information.
5,CMT - Kenny Chesney,"An excellent behind-the-scenes video from the current CMA Entertainer of the Year. Nobody puts on a show like the man from Luttrell, Tennessee, Kenny Chesney. This video gives you a good look at the 2008 ""Flip Flop Summer Tour"". There is additional footage of a few of Kenny's past performances in 2005, 2006 & 2007. This is a must have for any Kenny fan."
3,Not Comfortable,The shoes were very nice looking and sturdy but not very comfortable and eventually unable to use them anymore for work purposes.
3,Not Science...,"I was looking for a book that was about science rather than logic. This book is called the ""SCIENCE"" of reincarnation. There was not a single bit of science in this book. It was all about trying to sell the Krishna belief to the reader. I will admit there were some good points on the existence of the soul, but nothing more than another book trying to scare a person into their beliefs. If you want a funner book to read that tries to scare you into believing what it says, go read the Bible.3/5John McAdam: Author of ""Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?"""
5,The Best!!,"This is by far the BEST toothbrush on the market. I have had mine for 5 years now and recently went to the dentist for the first time in 4 years. He was amazed at how good my teeth were (no work needed at all!) and attributed it to the Sonicare. I use this exclusively and floss (maybe) six times a year. This product is wonderful, I wouldn't buy anything else."
1,What they said!,"Amazon tried to push this set to me a something special. I had to laugh when I read peoples reviews. I already bought most of this stuff three times and that was before the Rhino reissues. I bought the LPs, the bad sounding first CDs, and the Rykodisc CDs with ""bonus material"" in the early 90's, I wasn't even paying attention when he repackaged the stuff for Rhino. How many definitive reissues does one artist need especially when he's selling Lexus autos on TV? What happend to the angry young turk?If you never bought this stuff fine, but for us older fans enough is enough."
2,It's About Time These Have Been Re-Issued!,"There seems to be a bit of a tug-o-war between fans who have bought the originals, re-issues and re-re-issues and those who mark the re-re-re-issue as something noteworthy. I fall into the former category and find that it makes sense (from Costello's accountants' point of view) and doesn't make sense (from the point of view of any consumer who already owns three copies of ""Tokyo Storm Warning""). Personally, I'll wait until the Starbucks re-re-re-re-issue in 2010."
1,Gotta pay for the twins.,"You're better off becoming a Graham Parker fan. He's not as greedy and still making viable music. He was always a better songwriter and the Rumour were a superior backing band to the Attractions. Besides, the Graham Parker stuff is affordable."
3,Not Necessary!,"Ok, look, if you don't own ANY of the Rhino 2-CD reissues of Elvis's albums, then yes, this box set makes sense. But, if you DO own the Rhino discs, this new set of reissues is a waste of money. The music doesn't sound better, AND you're getting the U.S. track listings. Plus, the Rhino reissues all came with a second disc of bonus tracks. This is now the 4th time these albums have been reissued! ENOUGH!!!"
1,"Great music, already been released (in better forms)","This is 5 star music. But it has already been reissued, many times.In my opinion (and I believe, in any Costello-fan opinion), the""definitive Costello reissue"" is the 2-CD series issued a few yearsago, with each of the original albums doubled with a second,full CD of unreleased, b-side, alternate, live, demo takes, sometimeseven better than the original material.Very little (if any?) of that extra material seems to be issued in this box set.If you love Costello's music, then the 2-CD reissue is the right place toturn to: do yourself a favour, check it out, and pass on this box set."
2,I have to agree with the other reviews,"I bought them the first time when Ryko put out good reissues during the 90's, and Rhino got me hook line and sinker with the outstanding releases they did just a few years ago( and just finished with last year by the way ). I can understand any record label wanting to put out what they have the rights to, but the Elvis reissues have just gotten out of hand. I'm glad these cd's are going to be in print for anyone who wants to buy them, but unless something really special comes along my Rhino cd's will not be replaced."
1,No-one in their right mind would buy this.,"Up until now, the repeated re-reissuing of EC's brilliant catalogue has been a delight and a thrill, with pleanty of new material added to the Ryko reissue, and then staggering amounts of it in the Rhino releases. But who in their right mind would buy any of these new reissues? How moronic does Hip-O think Elvis's fans are? I don't even buy the line that they are suitable for new EC fans. All fans, new and old, should own the Rhino reissues. This set doesn't even cover the Warners albums. I'm a long time, tragic EC fan, but he should be ashamed to sanction this latest reissue program, at least so far. The plans for later release of new material, and a deluxe MIAT look much more worthwhile."
2,Awful . . .,I really didn't like this book. I don't think this book is going to be useful for me. The customes are awful. I really regret the money I spent with this purchase.
4,"Surprising pleasures of ""Running Down Division Street""","Having experienced an urban childhood myself, though in a city much smaller than Chicago, I recognize in Sauci Churchill's sharp and skillful poems the days when food (and garbage) smelled stronger, streetcars were noisier, and grown-ups (I thought) knew what they were doing. If James T. Farrell and Saul Bellow had been poets, maybe they would have written verse like ""Running Down Division Street."" I commend her short, evocative book."
1,NPR review misleading,The reviewer on NPR liked this book which is why I purchased it but I was disappointed. Would not recommend even if you like shocking and depressing content.
4,Intriguing Perspective,"In perusing the pages of this novel, I found countless aspects which appealed to me, from the strong character developments to the exciting plot, but it was the character of ""Henry Faber"" which most interested me. It is very rare to find a novel which indirectly presents one who would normally be teh villain as the hero in a sense. By the end, I wanted Faber to escape Britain and successfully expose the allied deceit, despite the horrid consequences such an even would have entailed for the world. Follet was exceedingly successful in garnering support and sympathy for an otherwise nefarious character; an apathetic Nazi agent with only a shade of conscience. I musn't give any important plot developments away, but I must say I was very sad with the end. In essence though, this was a very engaging story with a dynamic and exciting plot and well developed characters, and perhaps one of the quickest reads I've yet encountered (it took only a few hours to read)."
3,Tubby Likes This Book,The Second World War is roaring and the allies have a problem a spie is lose and he knows there greatest secret. Ken Follett shines in this book of wits and deception. I do not read many mystery books but i am glad I read this one. The book kept me on the edge of my seat and the two stories in the book felt like they were two trains on a collision course. I would recomend this book to people who like thier books to take them for a ride.
3,why does everyone think it's sooo excellent?,"I agree and think Ken Follet is a great writer, but what is everyone raving about? Yes, this book was exciting, but it just didn't hit the spot for me completely. I defedently think others should read it, but I sadly was not as impressed as I thought I would be."
3,Meh,"This book was ultimately boring. Nothing mind-blowing happened and I found it generally unappealing. I'm a huge Ken Follet fan, but this book made me question if it was even the same author that I'd been reading."
3,A good ride!,"Of course the allies fooled the Germans! Other than the predictable outcome, the book was a very good read. Held my attention from start to finish. My first Follett, and not my last."
4,Eye of the Needle Review,"The book told a believable story woven around the invasion at Normandy. The characters were well developed, there was action and intrigue, a little sex and a surprise heroine. It wasn'ta classic, but was an enjoyable read."
4,Conflicts,"This story, which I purchased from Amazon for my Kindle, seemed almost too authentic in its many aspects. It's a scary tale. If dead bodies are too much for you to stomach, don't read this book. However,I found myself admiring the main characters, both the ""spy"" and the woman trapped on the island, but at the same time feeling horror at the deeds of the man and wondering if there couldn't have been some way for the young woman to escape her plight earlier.That's what makes a good story - conflicts - these kept me on my toes, trying to help out and tell the characters what to do!"
3,Huge Hole in the Plot,"I was incredulous at the end of the book because all I could think was: When Faber went back to the shepherd's cabin alone to neutralize the shepherd, why didn't he send his radio message to Hitler then??? He was alone with a functioning radio and he could have contacted the U-boat that was there to pick him up and he could have transmitted his critical, war-winning news to the Feurer. Why did he come all the way back to the woman, then go through all the drama that followed trying to get BACK into the shepherd's cabin to send his message?? You can drive a tank through a plot hole that big!"
5,Could Be Ken Follett's Best Book - Terrific,"This book provides believable suspense of a German spy working in England during World War II. The book has plenty of suspense, historical relevance, a love story, and action all wrapped up in one not-too-long book. It is a great read. It is the book that turned me on to writing talents of Ken Follett."
4,Different point of view of Follett,"This one had lower ratings than many of the other older Follett novels, but I really enjoyed it. Typical Follett characters are the heroes... but this one's a little different. The main character is the ""bad guy"" in this novel, and I liked getting that side of the story.I'll admit, it's not the BEST of the author's work, but it's definately and enjoyable read, and for such a good deal, it's worth it!"
4,Excellent,"Eye of the Needle Excellent! Suspenseful! I enjoyed it very much, as I do all of Ken Follets works. Bravo Bravo"
3,VOices not great,"I love ken Follett and have listened to both jackdaws and hornet flight on tape. Those books were so extremely excellent, but this one is not as great. I am not a big fan of the different voices, and the narrator talks really really fast, which is hard becuase then you can't follow along. This one is just ok."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Mama bear v spy.In this case, not a story I bought into, as a mother and child get in the way of an enemy agent's plans, and must fight to survive.There's also a movie, which in this case I actually thought was better, something that is pretty rare.This is passable enough, but that is about it.3 out of 5"
2,Over hyped,"The book was rated as very good by the seller with a slightly bent and creased spine. The book is readable, and I think all of the pages are there, but it looks like it was an original from the 1970's. The pages are yellow/orange. Not just around the edges, but the whole page. I bought it as a gift, but will not send it."
2,Dissapointing,"After reading Pillars of Earth, I thought of reading other Ken Follet's books. Based on the customer reviews i picked this one, but what a crappy book, it starts really slow, and gets interesting until you reach 20% of it. I agree with the reviewer who said there was a huge hole in the plot, but i think the worst part was the ending, how come suddenly Follet makes this lame woman the hero of the book, unbelievable. Honestly, every time I had to read events related to this woman and her family I skimmed through the whole thing. The ending sucks so much, that it ruined the whole book for me, I don't think that I'll be reading Follet for a while."
1,Eye of the Needle,"I was really excited when I began to read this book. I love history and WWII is probablly my favorite war. The first half of the book is really good and suprising. I thought I was in for a good read. The story had so much potential. I was dissapointed when the author portrayed the man , Henry Faber, with such expertise at the beginning but then turned his personality totally around at the end. To be a suspence thriller the plot was easy guessed and the key element of suprise was left out. The author failed to make the book the slight bit realistic by leaving out any trace of human error in his charachters. I always knew what was going to happen and was dissapointed when I dicovered my conclusions were right."
3,Just Too Many Coincidences,"Give Ken Follett credit; he really knows his stuff. You can easily imagine yourself in wartime London in this very exciting thriller. The characters are portrayed in a very lifelike way and it is a good read. Unfortunately the plot itself is not remotely credible. It relies on coincidence after coincidence, and everything falls into place just as it must in order for the German spy to be captured. Written early in his career, it's not Follett's best. Still, the book's historic accuracy, particularly in relating the lives of normal British citizens during the war salvages a few stars."
4,Good read like all of Follett books,I like historical novels and Follett is a master at bringing in enought details from the time the novel was set to make it feel like you are learning a little about what people who lived at that time went through.
2,Kind of disappointing,"I have been a Ken Follett fan, and so I bought this book hoping for intrigue like the Key to Rebecca, and sweeping detail like Pillars of the Earth. I was disappointed on both counts. A contributing factor is that I'm still kind of new to reading e-books on my Kindle Fire, although I doubt that had much impact on my impressions of the content. The neglected wife's way-too-detailed-and-lengthy sex with the spy and the lack of impactful suspense negated what could have been a great read. I'll read more of Follet's work, but right now the score is: 2 good ones, 1 disappointment."
3,I enjoy Follett's style,"Ken Follett writes a very good novel with thorough aspects of the time period and culture where the story takes place. Great effort is spent in developing all of the characters. I have to agree that the ending was a little far fetched and easily predictable. Anyone who enjoys this Follett book should definitely read his Book ""The Jackdaws"". That one I give 5 stars to."
4,A fantastic thriller novel,"In the genre of thriller novels, Follet's ""The Eye of the Needle"" is one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys thriller novels..you will not be disappointed with this one...trust me."
2,"Wow, Slow","I love Ken Follett books! This book took me so long to get into the story. I think it took half the book until I really got into the story and character. The last half of the book is great. The first half is long and confusing. His other books are much better! I'd still read a Follett book, no one's perfect. :)"
5,A brilliant book ; need I say more,One of the best books I have read by Ken Follett. A brilliant piece of work. No page could have been done better.
3,Mediocre,"The historical accuracy is top-notch. However the drama that permeates the ending is rather bland and sometimes just eye-brow raising...consider this...if you had FACTUAL evidence that would essentially win your country the war...wouldn't you at least send a transmission of your discovery? It would be like a Japanese spy refusing to warn Hiroshima and Nagasaki of their impending doom because the information is too ""sensitive"" to be transmitted over the radio, it just doesnt make sense. I agree with one reviewer here on the concept that there is a plot hole so big ""you could drive a tank through it""."
2,Not bad,"I got this book for free somehow. I was looking for a thriller, and settled on this one. I guess it could technically be a thriller, and it was a pretty good read, but it felt like it could have been a lot shorter for the amount of actual plot it had. Plus, a number of the character relationships were rather irritating."
2,This was a condensed version,"I was expecting a full copy, not the Reader's Digest condensed version. The (full) original book is of course excellent"
3,"Good story, too much fiction","The conspiracy behind the whole story begins ok, but though the pages (at the end, particularly) it turns out to be too much, and you end up disregarding the whole thing."
4,Eye of the needle,"Well, I enjoyed it quite a lot. There are some interesting caracters in it and Follett writing is very pleasant as far as I can get not beeing English my native language."
5,Eye Of The Needle,"This was hard to put down a real page turner. This book re started me reading again twenty years ago. Ken Follett puts a great picture in my head when I read his books.Con, it could have been twice as long."
3,Fascinating,set in WWII this spy novel relied on human skill rather than computer technology. The human spirit of survival fueled the superhuman strength of ordinary people.
4,Eye of the needle,A gripping tale set during World War II. Set mainly on a remote island the authors imagery brings this story to life. Intriguing!
2,Eddie Bauer Performance Boccee Set - Crate busted in mail.,"The set is fine, however the crate was completely busted up. I will think twice before I order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all. I was going to try and get a refund, but I am not going to pay to have it returned. However, if the ""Powers that be"" might receive this e-mail - a new crate or bag would be wonderful.An Amazon Patron,Iris"
2,Won't last long,"Bought it strickly for the looks. The contents inside last about 7-10 days. If you want to frugal, I suggest you lift only one corner of the foil just abit."
5,Micro-who?,"I've been a Windows user since version 1.0 in 1980-something. I'd looked at Macs from time to time and liked some of what I saw, but couldn't imagine making the leap. Too much trouble for too little reward.Then I played around with an iMac (an older one) that had been upgraded to OS X.1, and saw how Apple had not only solved some of the old shortcomings of MacOS (like the inability to access the menus without reaching for the mouse), but most of the still-current shortcomings of Windows (like instability, ugly graphics, and the inability to use it without having seven or eight other Microsoft products shoved down your throat).I've leapt."
5,Rock Solid,"I have been using Mac OS X for almost one year. As soon as a started using it I realized that this was truly a step forward. I have daily experience using several operating systems. At work several editions of Windows but not X P and at home I use Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X 10.1. I have never had a crash with Mac OS X except for once when I disconnected A CDRW while it was writing. But even if I don't consider the stability of the operating system Mac OS X offers the best graphics and the ease-of-use on any computer system today. But wait, there's more. One can return to the command line interface and then run programs a la Unix. So far every device that I have attached, plugged in or installed has worked flawlessly. No problems with drivers. I can't imagine even comparing it with any Windows product. I am dictating this review directly using IBM ViaVoice for Mac OS 10. Another product which works very well with Mac."
2,Watch out for USB driver problems and kernel panics,"Six months into using OS -X started having Kernel panics (Apple's blue secreen of death). Not running non-Apple programs, multi-tasking, or running peculiar non-standard hardware (Logitech tracball, HP printer/scanner). 5 trips to the repair shop - new hard drive, new RAM, new system board, upgrade to 10.2.8; 4 phone calls to Apple ""Support."" Kernel panics returned. Lots of web searches - found lots of boards where people have the same experience, and found the only permanent solution was downgrading to OS9 or upgrading to OS 10.3. ""Support"" denies it's poor USB software."
4,"Practical, informative, useful book for...","...beginners and intermediates.I found this book very useful, full of technical details and practical information. It covers items from preparing your computer to preproduction (story boards, etc.), editing, using slideshows, sound, titling, and post-production. Information about the technical qualities of digital video cameras was also very helpful.After a year, this book may be out of date, but for right now, I think it will help beginners and intermediates. I found it more useful than Ed Gaskell's The Complete Guide to Digital Video, because Johnson et al. were more practical and direct."
2,For Extreme Newbies Only,"More fluff than content and they are using a product that is popular I guess but hardly video editing standard. If you know anything about digital video you don't need this. If you are a complete newbie and using Pinnacle products, I recommend reading your manual before you buy this."
5,Fantastic video education,"If you want to learn the basics, and beyond, of filming, editing and rendering your video, home or semi-professional, buy this book. The guys, mostly Dave Johnson, that put this together write in a style and format that is fun, entertaining, and easy for a novice to understand. They have done an excellent job of producing a book that carries you step by step through the wonderful world of videography. I read a lot of books to gain knowledge about different subjects and I wish everyone wrote the way these guys do. Their title explains exactly what you can expect. Buy it!"
2,Not as depicted,"This film was not depicted as 3D, everything lead me to believe it was the 3d version. Very disappointed ."
1,Shipper issue,"""Received the incorrect product, the picture indicates 2D & 3D one BluRay Disc, I received the 2D Version of 3D Theatrical Release which is not what I ordered. The reason I wanted the 3D version is that I already have the 2D version from last year, btw the music/video is great."
1,Disappointed in Kenny Chesney 3D - 2D version,"This was supposed to be the 3D version, but came as the 2D version. who would want a 3D DVD in 2D???"
1,"Re-release Has Only 4 Extra Songs, Not 7","I guess this re-release is for super fans only or people who didn't live near a location of the department store that had the exclusive right to sell the original release last year. According to Image Entertainment's website, the company releasing the new director's cut dvd, this dvd has 4 songs not included on the original dvd release, not the 7 that Amazon's listing description here claims. The songs are You & Me, Guitars and Tiki Bars, Don't Blink and Never Wanted Nothing More.The concert in this dvd is very good with Kenny giving energetic performances. If you already own the original release, it's your call whether you want to re-buy it for 4 extra songs. The concert gets 5 stars from me, but this dvd gets 1 star for the cash grab by the dvd company. Trying to double your sales by temping big Chesney fans to re-buy something they already own is a cheap way to make money."
2,Title deceiving - it is NOT a 3D DVD,"I bought this DVD as a gift for someone only because it says on there it is a 3D, but the title was deceiving. Once the DVD arrived, I found out that it actually is just a plain DVD, nothing in 3D. Although the person I bought this for still liked the DVD, we were disapointed to find out that it is just a plain DVD. If you are expecting a 3D as the title shows on the DVD, do not bother buying this...."
1,wrong country,im still waiting for a reply to my email the disc i was sent will not play on my blu-ray here in australia tried it in 3 so im stuck with it moral to the story make sure it plays in your country not just the US
3,It works ok...,"This developer worked okay on my hair, but it didn't make all of my hair completely blonde. I used it with L'Oreal's Quick Blue bleach and left it on for almost two hours. It turned my roots yellow blonde and the rest of my hair a light orange color. I had hair that had been dyed black several times, so having dyed it as much as I did I think it worked fairly well. It mixed good with the Quick Blue into a creamy texture and it took most of the black color out, but if you have black hair and you want blonde hair (not an orange color), I would go with a 40 volume instead, just condition your hair extra to avoid damage."
4,Creme Developer,This product works exactly as described- I couldn't use it so I gave it to one of my friends- but they really liked it!
3,Blah,I've used this product before. It's not my favorite but it's what I usually use. I would recommend this product.
1,Book for Corrupt Idiots,This book is the bible of the neocon movement. Its assertions over time have been proven false. The author is either deliberately lying (to push a political agenda) or has never traveled sufficiently to see the areas of grey between the complaints of groups in different geographies.
2,Flatware beware.,I ordered several of these and found them to be light weight instead of medium weight. If your looking for something with a little weight don't buy this product.
3,Scheibe's Sinfonias,A very pleasant piece of music. Nothing spectacular but it was very well crafted.
1,Bad product.,"I had to go through and individually sew each strap back onto the cover. If you even pulled the straps a tiny bit they would tear out or begin to. Because I didn't want to go through the return process I enforced every one of them. It works fine now, but it took me a long time to do."
1,ABSOLUTE CRAP!,"Worst seat cover I have ever bought. The seat and back fabric is OK, that blanket like stuff, but the other material is like panty hose and the straps rip out with the lightest pull. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Disappointed in the quality......,"I recently purchased this seat cover for my 2003 F-150 bench seat! The material for the seat cover is what I excepted and paid for, but the attaching material was very poor! Upon, installation the strings that were used for tying the seat cover to the bench broke! I thought it was just one string, but as we connected the rest of them we had at least 4 more break! The material that attached the string to the seat cover was cheap and flimsy and poorly designed! I hope it will least through the winter? I guess that's what I paid for! I wish they would have used better material to attach the seat covers!"
5,Great! Superb! Magnificent!,"The composer and saxophonist Moacyr Santos belongs (with Paulo Moura, Johnny Alf, Alaide Costa, Do Um Romo and few others) to a very unknown cathegory of brazilian popular music. That of afro-brazilian artists belonging to the Bossa Nova movement, considered by most people as an white middle-class way of play the samba. Santos, who lives in California since late sixties, have recorded very few in Brazil and America. This double cd ""Ouro negro/Black gold"" shows how good he is, with his sensual songs and magnificent arrangements. One of the best things ever recorded of modern brazilian music. Superb!"
5,Motivation to Learn!,"The Story of Louis Pasteur is an excellent movie. At first, I didn't know if I wanted to see it because it was in black and white, and I had stereotyped all black and white movies into the ""boring"" category. However, after seeing the movie, I feel so good about it that I want to add it to my movie collection. Louis Pasteur was a remarkable man, and his quest for knowledge to benefit people and not for monetary profit excited me and helped me feel grateful for the blessings I have (many of which can be attributed to him). He pursued knowledge and stuck by that knowledge even in the face of bitter opposition from his colleagues in science and medicine. I was so motivated by this movie, that I didn't just sit there and think, ""Oh, what a nice movie,"" but I really wanted to learn worthwhile things, too. This is the kind of movie that I want my children to see and learn from. Louis Pasteur is truly a role model."
5,Gift for yourself,I bought this with a gift certificate my company gave me. I had been wanting an electric toothbrush for over a year. I just couldn't get myself to pay that much for it. My dentist recomended this one. I really wanted one that spinned. I got it out when it arrived and have loved it. (a plus with the free shipping) I have checked around and the 2 pack replacement heads are cheaper online than at a store. The first try doesn't hurt like the other reviews would have you think it just tickles. I want to use it all the time. I have a teenager and a two year old. I do not have a lot of time for myself. I will make the time because my teeth feel so clean when I am finished. I did have them cleaned the day this arrived. Also I chose the cheapest shipping method (free with housewares purchase) and it arrived in about 2 days all my items together. If you have been thinking about one look at all the reviews this is the only brush that consistantly gets a 5 star.
3,Didn't last too long.,"I've had mine for over a year, and it stopped working last week. That's when I discovered that the designers have given you no way to replace the rechargeable batteries - you have to ""hammer"" the case to remove the batteries, then ""dispose"" of everything! That is unless you want to send it back to them, along with $50, to get a reconditioned replacement back. At this price, I would consider another toothbrush that allows you to replace the batteries."
2,Sonicare does not stand up over time...,"I had my sonicare for two years and suddenly it just stopped working. I contacted the sonicare company to find out how I could get it fixed. It just so happend that the warrenty on sonicare is only two years. Their solutions was for me to purchase a new unit. At the cost of sonicare and the replacement brushes, it is not worth it if you have to re-purchase the product every two years. BEWARE..."
5,great,"This is a great product . My teeth are getting whiter, my gums are less swolen and my teeth are a lot cleaner feeling.The only think that I don't like is that in the book it says that the unit beeps every 30 seconds and mine doesn't.But all in all this is the best toothbrush that I have ever used"
1,Lost,"I would like to give you a good review, but I havn't received all what I orderd, only half the order came, it was going to be shipped in 5 or 7 days that was 3 weeks ago. Can you tell me what happen to it???????????????????????????????????????????"
5,WOW,"I was taken aback by this album, after purchasing ""The Grave Digger"", I didn't think Grave Digger was faster of heavier, boy was I wrong. I knew in the opening second slash like sound, I was in for a treat. A little history for the new people: This is the 1993 reformation album. Six years before(1987) Grave Digger put out a commercial album called ""Stronger Than Ever"" under the name Digger. Luckily it failed, but Chris declared the band dead. So, one song in, Grave Digger has definitely returned. From ""Tribute to Death"" to ""Madness Continues"" you're treated to a heavy bombardment of music. Very fast, very loud. A great addition for any metal fan. This band needs more exposure I mean they've been out since 1980, how many people listen to them? Try to pick up a copy today, if possible, since it's seems to have gone out of print JUST THIS WEEK!"
5,boots,"These are very nice looking boots. With thick socks, they are comfortable to wear and they are a good buy for the money."
4,Boots,"I'm a woman with a long,wide, foot with a high instep. It is hard to find a good womens boot that fits well. Thats why I choose a man's boot. They fit like gloves, give me the support that I need, and look good,as well."
1,all junk,"what a waste. there are always the crafts that you skip over in any craft book, well, this book is a collection of the skip over craft ideas."
1,Anyone can put together a book like this????,I think this is the worst craft book I have ever brought!!! It might be ok if I was ten. I'm thinking about returning it or keeping it for 9 years for my 18 month old granddaughter. Please save your money. You can find almost all of these craft instruction free on-line.Barb R.
3,"Great book idea, but I never use it","I bought this book because it was written by local DIYers in my area... I actually bought two... one for me and one for a friend. I look at the book all the time, but I find that nothing in actually interests me to make it. I have had it for two years and I make a lot of home-made gifts, just nothing from this book. It is not the book's fault, the book is great... I just haven't found a project in it that I am inspired to do."
3,785 Amazing projects,"Not a lot of new ideas or ideas I could use. Had thought of it for granddaughter who's crafty, but didn't feel it had enough to warrant shipping it out to her."
4,lots of fun and great craft ideas,lots of fun and great craft ideas and lots of things to get inspriation from! i am definitely looking forward to doing some of these projects!
4,"Good projects, silly title","The projects in this book are fun, simple, and inspiring. The problem is the title: ""Saving the World from Mass Production"". I think some people have the wrong idea about mass production and use it as rhetoric to get attention. Not only does every project in the book require materials that have been mass produced (as most craft supplies are), but the book itself was mass produced, i.e. put through a printing press. I think anti-mass production gets confused with anti-waste and anti-over consumption. They all can co-exist peacefully.Enjoy the book!"
1,Hypocritical and Stupid,"Don't waste your money or your time on this book. Why is it called ""Saving the World from Mass Production"" when many of the projects require materials purchased at mass retailers? The tone of the book tries to be cool and hip, and ends up coming across as patronizing and immature. Most of the projects are available online in free craft forums like craftster.org, put up there by true super crafty individuals."
5,Great,"I liked that they talked to him. There was no videos but still was great. If you want has videos you can get the ""You Gotta Love That "" home video."

1,Bad Lacquer Job,I purchased a Cecilio Blue Lacquer Alto Saxophone Kit a few months ago.The overall appearance of the instrument is pretty good for the price.The tone and playability is also very good for the price.I have had problems with the Blue Lacquer coming off on the neck of the instrument and on the back side of the bell.I went to a local hobby shop and purchased some model airplane paint thesame color and have touched it up so it does not look so bad.I feel that the lacquer peeling off in this manner is a definite rip offso I cannot recommend this instrument.
1,Do not buy this,It broke with in 2 months. The co. would not even talk to me. I asked if they would credit me something and I would up grade. NO they said but they did say SORRY
4,Love new sax,This saxophone is amazing it has a nice clear tone and is very stylish. Before i had this sax i had a worthless peice of junk and i couldnt play with all my potential now im 1st chair in my orchestra at school. I love my sax.
4,Great Sax for School,"""My Son Loves the Sax, which means he should play it more. His sister (7 year sax player) said it was a good sax and fixed one slightly sticky key. It works great and is well contructed. Will do him good during the school years."""
4,The first part last,"Every African American male- teenager- who has fathered a child should be given a copy of this book and be required to read it. The book provides insight into how having a baby changes your responsibilities. Too often these fathers are insulated from the responsibilities of fatherhood, such as going to the doctor. The book provides a shocking glimpse into the mind of teenagers, but realistic. Adults might say, ""How could somebody think like this?"" Yet, Angela Johnson depicts accurately the prattle of teenagers. More than that, she demonstrates what I have seen as a teacher; perspicacious young ladies become pregnant by their boyfriends."
4,Cautionary Tale,"Angela Johnson uses the simple structure of back and forth ""Then"" and ""Now"" chapters until the two meet in this cautionary tale of teenage pregnancy. Bobby is only 16 and has a new daughter, Feather. The ""Now"" chapters hit hard as Johnson shows the reality of a teenager aborting his own life as a ""kid"" in order to meet the incredible needs of an infant. The ""Then"" chapters show us how Bobby and Nia got into this tough situation and how they dealt with the pregnancy.The brief chapters are at times poetic and bittersweet, but it's clear what the theme is and it's a theme every teen reader should appreciate by the end of the book. Recommended."
4,WOW!,This book is very enlighten to a young guy and may have made a mistake but is willing to take care of his responsibilities.
4,single father,"It gives nothing about this book away to say up front that it's about a single father in high school raising his brand new daughter. Johnson alternates the action forward and backward from the birth of the child, showing Bobby's struggles caring for an infant, and also giving brief glimpses of how things went when Nia was pregnant.By itself, it's a touching but realistic story of two students with promising futures that suddenly give way to parenthood because of one mistake. But for me, the story really came down to the question of why Bobby was raising the baby. This question is answered toward the end of the book, and to reveal that really would give the whole thing away."
4,4 teen dads,I think this was a very good book. The boy and his GF want to give up their baby but once somthing happens to the girlfriend he decides to keep the baby. I think this is a really good book for teen fathers to read because it shows how Bobby gave up alot of stuff to take care of his daughter.
2,First Part Last,"i thought that the book was not interesting. even though it was relistic, I did not enjoy it at all. It could have been betterby adding more details. Anyway, i just did not like it."
2,Not recommended,"I really didn't enjoy this book. The writing was somewhat confusing, and there were pages missing. A better job of proofreading should have been done."
4,"A lot like ""Hanging Onto Max""","This is a short book (131 pages), but is worth the few hours of reading time.Bobby is 16 and has a baby daughter named Feather. Mostly he takes care of her himself, only dropping her off at a baby sitter's for the time he has to go to school. Bobby has an extremely hard time taking care of Feather and going to school, after getting no sleep every night. Nia, Feather's mother, does not really come into the book until almost the end of the book.This book is sad and good. I gave it 4 stars because I don't think I'd ever want to read it again, but it is still worth reading.I recommend ""Hanging Onto Max"" more than this book.~Atalanta"
5,The First Part Last,"I loved almost everything about The First Part Last. The story is about 16 year old Bobby, and his girlfriend, Nia. Each chapter, except for two, is titled ''Then'' and ''Now''. Then descibes Nia and Bobby during Nia's pregnency. Now tells about Bobby and Feather, the baby, trying to make a living. The only thing that I disliked about this book was how short it was. My favorite chapter was when Bobby finds out that Nia is in a vegitive state and he has to take care of Feather on his own. It was sad.I hope that every middle-schooler gets to read The First Part Last by Angela Johnson. It's a very good book. I give it 5 out of 5 stars."
4,The First Part Last,"I think that the book was good,and it talks about how a teenagers life would be about if a couple were to have unsafe sex and have a child. It explains how life would be and that you cant be a teenager and that you have to be an adult, and think wisely about what you do.Also you can't go out and have fun all the time you would have to stay in the house and take care of your child.It talks about how you need to start useing your brain and think how you need to think about the consequences in life would be. Next reason that the book was really good was that it had a Then and Now in the book, and how it always keeps you updated on what happens next,and it was really detailed and that you can picture it in your mind.This is why I thought the book was really good."
4,its good,"THE STORY ""THE FIRST PART LAST"" IS A GOOD STORY AND HAS A GOOD PLOT. I LIKE HOW THINGS HAPPEN AND THE SEQUENCE THAT THERE IN.AND HOW THE CHARACTERS BACKGROUND."
4,VERY GOOD,Anthony StewartI think that this book was very good. I say this because it was very emotional. Another thing is that it was full of details. When i heard this book it mad me think about why you should not have a baby at a young age.
4,first part ..... to bad it was last huh,this book was cool the ending was better! couldnt belive that happened....... i wuld tell u but u should read it your self.
1,not what I was looking for,"I would rate myself as a woman with slightly more upper body strength than average. That being said, I could not get this item to work, whatsoever. My husband was able to, but watching him it was evident that this is NOT an easy tool to use. I have several boxes of wire to strip and I've found that a utility knife does the trick much easier. Knowing what I know now, I would not waste the money."
5,WOW what a wire stripper,"I will make this short. It works and works very well when set at the correct depth which is easy to do. Once set, the insulation just peels off the wire and never takes a chunk out of the wire or cuts a strand. I wished I had one of these a long time ago. I would have saved a lot of headache removing wire insulation. If you don't have one of these, get one."
1,Do not bye,It is bull I have been waiting for over a month and have not gotten it do not bye do not bye
2,Missing scenes- big disappointment,"I love this film and had seen it hundreds of times since it first came out. I was very excited about having my own copy. Everything was fine up until the point where Anthony meets Jenny then I noticed that an important scene didn't appear (how is Jenny able to get away from her bodyguard?). Then another one. Then another one... (for example, Salma's father secret meeting photographed by Akbar, Akbar in the hospital after being beaten by Salma's father's thugs, etc.). In other words, this is a very poorly made copy. If one had never seen this film parts of the story wouldn't make sense at all. Not worth what I paid."
5,PCE Student Review,"My favorite book is Cabin on Trouble Creek by Jean Van Leeuwen. This book is realistic fiction. It's about two boys in the woods and my favorite character is Will.Will is my favorite character because he is not afraid to fight a bear and he learns how to make different things like a spear to use for fishing.I love is author's writing style is good because she made Daniel and Will have to survive on their own.I love is book because it teaches you how to survive on your own. Their dad says that they would be back in five weeks, six at tops, but they didn't come back yet. The boys meet Solamon and go to a corn mill, they make moccasins, and learn how to catch animals in a trap and make a fish trap.I recommend this book for kids 8 and up and adult or adults to read to kids 6 and up."
3,An above average survival story,"Although this book bears similarities to other stories about survival in the wilderness, Van Leeuwen's work has its strengths.Two young brothers are forced to endure difficult conditions in pre-settlement Ohio while their father goes back to Pennsylvania to bring the rest of the family along. They meet Solomon, a native American, who provides both practical and spiritual advice. Solomon is probably the author's strongest characterization and this aspect of the story is what sets Van Leeuwen's work apart.The boys' encounters with wild creatures are exciting and it is great fun to learn with them how to survive based on common sense and perseverance. The story is effectively paced and fans of wilderness tales will be satisfied by this reading experience."
3,A refreshing new tale,"I thought this was a pretty good book, not as good as The Sign of the Beaver or My Side of the Mountain, but it's nice to have a new book about the same things to go alongside the old ones. The story was well told and well paced, the characters were identifiable, and the story was educational without being boring. I enjoyed reading it."
5,"Good, fun read...","I didn't know who Bruce McNall was before I purchased the book. I was familiar with the LA Kings run a few years ago and thought it would be interesting to read about the man behind it. I enjoyed the book. It is an easy, quick read. Bruce covers a lot of time in the book so the material is broad, but not very deep. His stories are interesting and often humorous. Some subjects were glossed over and I would have liked a little more detail. No doubt this book is a prelude for a movie about Bruce. The book covers so many areas(ancient coins, sports, horseracing, hollywood, etc.) of Bruce's life that there is something for just about everyone. Good read and I highly recommend it."
5,Fascinating tale of boom and bust,"Bruce Mcnall story is intriguing from page one...from working in a small coin shop in arcadia, ca ...to hobknobbing with the likes of the Texas Hunt brothers(at about the time they were trying to corner the silver market), investing horses, producing movies, and buying sport franchises...it is just unbelievable that one man could do all that he did by age 44...I loved every page of this book...would luv it to be made into a feature movie or atleast a t.v. movie."
5,A Wild Ride,"Following Bruce McNall's storied, and seemingly successful, career, it came as quite a surprise to hear of his legal woes and incarceration. This book chronicles all in a highly readable manner."
1,Fun While it Lasted,"Seriously why would anyone indulge someone who bilked the banks ""the people"" of over 200 million dollars?Who pays for these unscrulpulos activities?And he is ""famous""? Only in his own mind. What is wrong with society that these people get attention?Don't contribute more to his ego and buy his book."
5,Getting Lost in Tinsletown,"The author, Bruce McNall, was no doubt a flawed individual who got swept up in some schemes that would ultimately send him to prison; yet he had a great deal of charisma which oozes through the pages of his book.This is a guy who certainly knew how to get people to buy into whatever it was he was ""selling"" at the time, and his perspective on his wild ride into the craziness of big business, professional sports, and of course, Tinsletown, make for an extraordinary read.Although his antics were a bit devious at times, McNall provided a fascinating look into the events that shaped his destiny, and really gives anyone a lesson into how fleeting fame and fortune can be when mixed with the volatile world of money, power and influence.That's a dangerous combination and should be handled with extreme care. McNall handled it with great abandon, but his honesty in revealing his flawed approach to certain aspects of life made for quite a compelling narrative."
4,Swimfan (A ride of suspense),"I was a little skeptical on viewing this movie. I thought the concept could be a little cheesy. For the fact that, the entire swimteam of my town went to it.And, had to comment on how he swam. But anyways, i was really hypotized or drawn into this movie. It held a great theme throughout. The ending could have been a little better, but overall it is definately worth seeing."
3,Tell Me You Love Me,"This is ""Fatal Attraction"" meets ""Can't Hardly Wait"". Swim star Ben (Jesse Bradford) has a picture-perfect romance with Amy (Shiri Appleby) until Madison (Erika Christensen) comes around. Ben and Madison have a one-night-stand then Madison goes completely psycho with incessant e-mails, phone calls, pages and little gifts in his locker. Madison even goes to lengths as to ruin Ben's budding swimming future with an accusation of steroids and almost murdering an elderly man Ben works with at a hospital.Madison yet refuses to see her and Ben's relationship for what it is (or what it isn't). The ending is predictable and teens films are beginning to tire me. See ""Fatal Attraction"" if you really want to see someone go crazy!"
1,Waste of time and water,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, if not the worst. The scenarios were impossible to believe, her changing his pee to make it look as if he were on drugs? It's an all around stupid movie and was a waste of my time and money at the theater some odd years ago. If anyone of you are considering paying money for this, please don't. To put it plainly: it SUCKS."
1,someone should recall this Swimming With Crap,"A Fatal Attraction for the high school generation. This was about a pyscho girl played by Erika Christensen (Homeroom, The Perfect Score) who lives with her mom and her brother is a weird nerdy kid. She stalks Jesse Bradford's (Bring It On, Clockstoppers) character who is on the ""swim team"". After water polo fun (sex) in the swimming pool Bradford's life becomes a living eternal hell when Christensen sends him pictures, makes his life a living hell and almost kills his girlfriend. The real truth is, is she picks athletes and stalks them till they cant be stalked no more. If you call this movie a 5 star movie, there's something seriously wrong with you, truly. It felt like I took poison pills 20 times when watching it only once. Christensen isn't that great in this movie...she's kinda annoying. Also starring James DeBello (Cabin Fever, Detriot Rock City) as Christensen's silent nerdy brother."
1,Fatal Attraction Dopleganger Zero Star,"Talk about A rehashed Film. They should have called this Film Fatal Attraction II Clorine Paradise. You know how sequils are there is not as good as the original. Most of the eliments were taken from Fatal Attraction. The makers of Fatal Attraction should have sued them for copywrite infringment. They shold make a spoof of this crappy movie you know, they should but jaws in the pool. You know the part in swimfan when he finds is friend dead in the pool, that was the bunny rabit boiling in the pot on the stove in Fatal Attraction. both movies are the same.1. One night stand - Swimfan2. The affare - Fatal Attractionand all the rest of the elementsCoputer lamese terms if they were Operating Systems1. Fatal Attraction - Windows 20002. Swimfan - Windows XPWindows XP was bilt from Wondows 2000 TechnoligySwimfan was bilt from The Fatal attraction sroryline. Got the idea? Anyways this moive sucks because it's been rehased rebuilt fron another movie."
1,Whoa,"This is sad. I was reading the reviews and couldn't believe people thought this was a good movie! We all can have opinions but I believe the people who said this was good were either in love with Erika Christensen or Jesse Bradford because there had to be something clouding your judgement. This film was horrible, one of the worst films I've seen really. It was worse than Spice World, Gigli and any film starring Madonna. No film can get worse than this. Well, let me take that back. I thought nothing could get worse than Body of Evidence but Swimfan proved me wrong. Sheesh!"
2,Swimmer - Where were they ?,"How he got any fans swimming like that is beyond me, didn't see one decent swimmer in the entire film, that is coming from a former swimmer, then again how many swimmers could act ? Johnny Weismuller ? Did he act though ? Tarzan didn't need to say much.All in all an ""ok"" film, anything that promotes swimming is a good one in my book, however they should have used pro/college swimmers for the shots where you don't see the actors faces then at least it would have given it some realism in that sense."
2,COMIC TEEN TWIST ON FATAL ATTRACTION,"I can't belive this was ever intended as serious drama. Instead, it plays like a tongue in cheek comedic teen twist on ""Fatal Attraction."" New student Erika Christensen gets obsessed with swim star Ben Cronin. What follows is hilariously over the top as Cronin desperately reassures his girlfriend Shiri Appleby that his quickie with psycho Erika was a one-time mistake. Too bad Kobe Bryant didn't see this before going to Colorado for knee surgery."
5,"Everyone told me not to get this, its a waste of time....","WHATEVER! I loved it and i thought it was so creepy, but yet it could totally happen if you werent careful.And by the way, its not about the internet. Everyone was like, ""oh yeah its about an obsessive girlfriend on the internet"" no...but it is a very good show, with shocking twists. I reccomend you go see it!"
1,"Ok, I'm sorry","I apologize for this movie. Fatal Attraction by way of Crimson Tide with a segue into a Greg Louganis splish splash twist. Thsi movie is so bad that I'm just goign to call it bad. Again, movies assume that if it's cute and sexy and a little thrilling, it can be dumb and vapid and make money.And unfortunately, tripe like this can."
4,"Good thriller, even with it's problems",Jesse Bradford and Erika Christensen deivers good performances in this good movie. if you're a fan of teen thrillers then this one's for you. The cast is perfect for this movie. Shiri Appleby of Roswell fame and Jason Ritter star as the supprting characters.The disc contains a commentary with the director (John Polson) and the two stars. It also has a featurette and 10 deleted scenes. The Full Screen and Widescreen versions are on opposite sides on this disc. It's a dual sided disc.
2,"Not the best in ""mystery""","Knowing from the beginning who is the villian(villianist)& the quite obvious ""why"" makes the movie only have to live up to the expectations of what sinister deed will she(the villianist) do next."
2,Be Warned,"I made a HUGE mistake in purchasing this DVD. This is one of the worst, most predictable films I have ever seen. You see, when you watch a film, you want to be surprised. You don't want to have to say, ""Oh, let me guess, this is going to happen..."" Save yourself the money and just rent it if you still want to, but at least, you have been warned. Enough said."
5,"Swimfan, 5 stars >> ultimate summer thriller!!","This movie was totally what I thought it would be plus more! ""Swimfan"" keeps you in suspense and thinking what's going to happen next; that ""edge of your seat"" feeling. This movie was a hit, I would definitely recommend ""Swinfan"" to ANYONE!!"
4,swimfan =not a bad breastroke,"I had huge hopes for this movie and when it was over not a bad flick.At times it was very predictable and been done before a 100 times over.But i knew that going in ,the acting was very convincing and top notch.My only cheif complaint it needed to be at least another 15 - 20 minutes longer.For me this is more like a guilty pleasure like film.Others will enjoy while some may think its a complete waste .Overall it delivers on most fronts and is very fast paced.I have always been a fan for this type of genre boarding on horror, so my opinion may be a little biased."
1,Watching This Was Like Being Naked in A Poison Ivy Patch,"...you're probably thinking THAT BAD huh? Well think of the poison ivy scenerio times 10,000 and that is how bad this film is. It is so bad I am not going to waste my time and go into it. I just want to save unsuspecting viewers from such torture.What do you get when you have:A tired plot?Terrible actors?And a script that seemed to be written by a one-paw dog?Swimfan...enough said."
1,Bloody Water.,"This is a horrible movie. I can't possibly think of any reason anyone would want to watch this garbage. It's terribly written, predictable, and badly acted. I was almost falling asleep through most of it, near the end when she's beating at him and his girlfriend in the pool with that mop thing, or pool net or whatever it was, is just laughably ridiculous. I'd rather drown myself in a mudhole than watch Swimfan again."
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD,"...I'm usually not compelled to write reviews on here, but this movie was so hard to swallow, that I had to regurgitate somewhere...so it may as well be here.This movie felt like it was edited with a chainsaw. The phrase ""how covenient!"" pops into mind about every 5 mins. I just wanted to slap every character for being so dumb. It's so bad that you never actually see the villian committing her acts. Only the before and after...like I said....chainsaw.And what happened to the mother after she was cracked on the head with the trophy? Does she die? Does she live? Who knows? Again, chainsaw.The actors aren't bad...just bad writing...they do the best that they can with this drivel.And isn't it funny that in both Fatal Attraction and this film...the temptresses both drown???Now where is the boiling bunny?"
3,Just another one.,"This is just another teenage movie that has nothing more to do than ""waste"" you two hours! It is not so bad but it is not good eithr. There are thousands of movies based on a girl's fatal obsession with a boy and no matter how hot the chicks are, they cannot make it special! Just a usual film with handsome boys and beautiful lethal women! It depends on the viewer whether he wants to spend two hours watching it or not! Simple as that!"
3,Good But Far From Great,"This movie basically is one of those that you know what is going to happen from the beginning. The lead should have been a bigger name or more suited for the role, from the stalkers point. You have to treat this as a comedy really, although some parts flowed well, others did not."
3,skeptics beware....,"i went into watching this moving with a purely unhopeful attitude for this movie. However by the end of the film i was fully engaged! not only is this movie high intensity, it has a cute side plot between ben and his girl friend that extends into ben(jesse bradford)saving her life.those who looked at the previews and said they'd never rent this movie, look out because you just might find something you like. Yes , swimfan won't be taking home any oscars, but it could however take home your approval."
2,Even Erika can't save this film....,"I bought this film despite the bad reviews over the past couple of years, hoping to find just a glim of hope in it. Erika Christensen, being one of my favorite actresses..can't even save the film. It has good music, and some moments that get semi-thrilling or intense, then go right back down.And even though you respect Jesse's Bradfords character, he annoys you at the same time. Somehow, he ALWAYS knows what to do in every situation, and it makes the movie even more unrealistic and immature.It had potential, but just couldn't quite make the cut."
4,Kick...good movie!,"This was a really really good movie for teens! If ur reading this u should see it and then buy it becuz it rocks! Theres violence, [etc.] and its jst good! So go out and buy it!"
2,Does for pools what FATAL ATTRACTION did for elevators,"Swimfan (2002) Erika Christensen, Jesse Bradford, Shiri Appleby, Kate Burton, Clayne Crawford, Dan Hedaya, D: John Polson. Slick high school hunk Bradford living on the east coast has a close to ideal life with a girlfriend and a swimming scholarship toward Stanford-but ironically when the new-girl-in-school (Christensen) keeps running into him, she leads him into a forbidding (and routine) trap beginning with seducing him in the pool. Christensen is no Glenn Close and the film is no FATAL ATTRACTION. Only the swimming pool setting and some thrilling scenes can set this standard teen-stalker apart from the others. Fact: Logically, a teenager cannot serve medicine to hospital patients without being a registered nurse, and that goes for Mr. Bradford! Running Time: 85 minutes and rated PG-13 for some language, sinister elements, and sexual content."
2,This movie really fell short of my expectations.,"I like a good thriller. Unfortunately, this was not a good thriller. The idea behind the movie is a good one. Obsession, sex, stalking, etc. But the dialogue was so cheesy and the premise so far-fetched that this movie lost all of its potential. The ending is a let-down and the acting is mediocre, at best.If you're into thrillers and have no other choices, you might want to rent this one. Otherwise, go with something else."
2,Fatal Attraction High,"This is the most blatant attempt at re-creating Fatal Attraction I've ever seen. Granted it's cheap entertainment at best, but as for originality one should look elsewhere. The sad thing is it will hit HUGE with the bubble gum crowd seeing as they have no clue as to what good cinema is and probably never got to see Fatal Attraction either, which might I add is also far more disturbing than Swimfan could ever dream of being. Madisyn Bell even has the characteristics of Glenn Close: fairly attractive but certainly not drop dead gorgeous. Overall, if you are 14 and listen to Britney Spears then this movie is for you, if not, go rent Fatal Attraction."
5,Fatal Attraction: You ain't got JACK on this movie!!,"Unlike some people, I never could watch a movie like Fatal Attraction and believe for one minute that Michael Douglas could cheat on Ann Archer and pick a dog like Glen Close to be the ""lucky"" adultress. Now Ben Cronin cheating on Shiri Appleby and picking Erika Christensen to be the adultress? I can TOTALLY believe that!! That woman is a feakin' bombshell!! She's also, in my opinion, a great actress. Seriously. Would you think that somebody who looks SO angelic could be a devious, murderous psychopath? Not me!! Erika did a fabulous job!! You never knew what to expect, and were always totally surprised with whatever she did. Ben Cronin also did a fabulous job of playing the unsuspecting jock who life crumbles around him because due to a tawdry one night stand. I just LOVED this movie!! Utterly suspensful!! This movie will have you on the edge of you seat!! 90 minutes of fabulous entertainment!!"
3,Could Have Been More Intense,"Unlike Fatal Attraction, this movie just wasn't intense enough. Thriller movies like these should have plenty of events that lead to an explosive, violent ending because this is what makes it interesting and popular like Fatal Attraction. It was somewhat violent, but not enough for me to like it."
2,"Formulaic, Throw Away Fatal Attraction Lite","Where's the boiling bunny? Welp, here we have non-descript youths experiencing the joy and ultimate pain of being a Fatal Attraction knock off. New, sensitive girl in school falls for swimmer who already has a girlfriend, in a moment of weakness, boy is seduced as girl says `Tell me you love me'. Boy comes to senses afterwards, girl does not; proceeds to get boy fired, barred from swim team, kills opponent, tries to kill girlfriend, tries to kill mother and tries to kill the boy. Arrested by cops, escapes, and sets up eventual showdown in, yes, the same place they had sex , the pool. Hurrah! Pretty formulaic stuff. The brother from that cheerleading movie is in it, and he's at least passable. The villainess is the moon pie faced girl last seen paying for her drugs in Traffic; maybe someone attractive could have pulled off the character a bit more. Seemed more like a bad after-school special that something to waste time with on cable. Blech."
3,"Fun, but could have been much more","Everything said in previous reviews is dead-on, as this film is nothing more than a remake of Fatal Attraction for teenagers. But while the movie hits into the formulaic ending after the first hour, I must say that the first hour was *really* good. I had the impression after watching it that after building up the first two thirds so well, the scripters didn't know how to wrap everything up, and so relied on the ole save the girl paint-by-numbers ending to wrap things up. A shame, because the acting was fantastic, the movie dark and gritty...in fact with a better last third and possibly another twenty minutes or so, this could easily have been a five star movie.Watch this for predictable but fun entertainment, but definetly keep an eye on the actors playing the male and female leads in this movie - quite impressive and they manage to take the material and make it work in more than your typical teenage-crowd movie. They've both got potential."
3,"Despite the title, it's actually pretty good","I didn't want to see this movie at all. The title makes it sound like a melodramatic love story. It doesn't even have any big stars in it!The thing is, though, that it's a thriller and it's actually quite good.Some girl falls in love with this championship swimmer, but he's already engaged. She decides that meeting him at the YMCA pool after hours is the best way to get him alone, seduces him, then...(you know...) The catch is, though, that she thinks that they might have a future together. He KNOWS they don't. Well, if SHE can't have him, NOBODY can.If I could, I'd give this movie 3.5 of 5 *s."
1,Does not last,For a stain this only stays on for maybe an hour at best. To top it off the color is on the orange side. Not happy at all.
2,Meh,"Great color and feels wonderful - but good luck trying to make it last on your lips for more than 20 minutes. I did love it as a cheek stain, but... just didn't last."
3,"great color, but it doesn't last","I love the color of this lip stain, but compared to other lip stains, the color lasts maybe half the time. I still like the stain, but I'll probably look for the same shade in a different brand"
4,Good book - product review now out of date,"The sections on how to make pages accessible appear to be exactly what we need. Just be aware that this book came out in 2000 and the products reviews are way out of date. For example, Dreamweaver Version 2 is discussed in the book and even in 2000 Version 3 was out. Now we have Version 4. Same with Frontpage, HomeSite, etc.However, what we need is HOW to make the pages accessible and this book appears to cover that well. As long as you don't look at the product section as being the latest information, this book is a good one -- and I think the only one of its kind."
4,Replacement Cable for Samsung SGH-A707,"Great product, does exactly what it is designed for. Only problem I had was the slow shipping."
3,"Without instructions, how do you know how to use it?!","I got this product hoping it'll help me upload pics to my computer. But how can you do that, if there's no instructions in the box?! Helpless product if there's no instructions. I can't tell if this is a good product or not, but how can you tell if there's any instructions?"
3,Be aware this merely a new title for an old book,"I ordered this book thinking it was different from Use What You've Got & Other Lessons I Learned from my Mom, which I bought in hardcover and enjoyed. It is not, it is the same as the older book. They simply retitled it."
4,Dead Calm,"I saw the movie first, with Nicole Kidman, Sam Neill and Billy Zane, and realized I had the book, so read it. Really good book, brought this landlubber reader right down to water level in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Memorable, well-drawn characters. Action cuts from one yacht, with a madman and the new bride, to the other yacht, which is slowly sinking, with the husband and two other people aboard. The husband and wife are frantically trying to reunite in the vast, empty sea. Tension abounds on both boats. The boats go further apart, then come closer, trying to find each other as the hours pass, the water rises in the sinking boat, and darkness falls. Climax? Wow!I wasn't surprised to find the book was out of print, but it shouldn't be, it's that good. A classic. Written in 1963. Williams born when Joseph Conrad was alive. I bought it and many other Perennial Library paperback mysteries 15 years ago for $.99 each, and was amazed to find it made into a current movie with big stars."
4,Dead Calm,"I first saw the movie, and wanted to read the book, which I got hold of via Amazon. I'm glad I did not approach the matter the other way around, as I would have been quite disappointed (I think). Actually, there is so little left from the book, I wonder why they chose to use the title. Charles F. Williams describes the characters very carefully, and the plot is very convincing. Not being a sailor myself, I cannot rate the precision of the nautical expressions, but that did not keep me from reading the book in one sweep."
5,awesome cd,"Great songs!I have been a Poison fan for 15 years and have always loved Bret michaels especially so i was thrilled to get this cd.one of the songs ""Raine"" is a heartfelt song about his daughter.great song.if you love poison this is a must get.all the songs are awesome and have catchy lyrics.i was a little hesitant because it's always been poison as a group but i was definitly impressed and would surely recommend this cd.you will not be dissapointed.and if you really like his cd then you can catch him on his solo tour and hear it live!!!!"
3,It's a Great Album,"Es un excelente disco, no te va a defraudar!!!!! tiene canciones buenisimas y muy distintas a Poison pero que si sos fanatico del grupo no te van a defraudar!!!Buenisimo, 10 puntos!!"
5,Absolutely love them,They are absolutely perfect for the cast iron skillet I purchased. It was an afterthought but I am SO glad I purchased them. It's easier than having to use my oven mitts as its not as bulky.
1,Too small.,"I don't know which pans these were meant for, but certainly not any that I own. The tube is so narrow I can only use it by wrapping it around the handle. Nothing's going inside, that's for sure! Waste of money; I tossed them."
2,good if it doesn't catch fire!,"I used these on my 2 lodge cast iron pans. (8"" and 12"") The length fits the handle perfectly, but they have both caught on fire. I've read other reviewers' posts that this has happened to them too. I think the instruction says to leave them off the pan handle except when you need to move the pan. But DUH, all cooking shows tell you to put some towel or mitt on a hot pan handle all the time as a reminder and caution that the handle is hot, so it's an unreasonable instruction to tell people to put the mitt handle on only when one needs to move the pan.It's a shame that this happens, as the price is decent for the pair. I've since replaced these with silicon handles."
4,Keep my hands safe,These work great. I cook on gas so it's not a good idea to have them too close to the flame. I've burnt the cuff on mine more than once. On the other hand they can get pretty beat up over time and replacing them is not too expensive.
3,not so special mitts,"I bought these thinking they would be helpful. But, truthfully, grabbing a pot holder is what I do more often than not. If you want them, get them, but they are not necessary."
4,A must have if you cook with cast iron.,"These handle holders or something like them is a must have if you like to cook with cast iron skillets. I've been cooking with cast iron for over 20 years now, and having a handle insulator that stays right on the skillet means you are much much less likely to burn yourself. The only gripe I have about these is that they are slightly bigger than the old handle holders and so they don't conform quite as well to the skillet handle, otherwise this would be a 5 star item. The previous handle holders I had lasted about 8 years, not bad for less than $10 for a set of two."
3,silicone may be better?,"These are probably okay if you're not challenged like I am. I actually caught both on fire (gas stovetop) accidentally -- up in flames! Also, they tend to slip a little, since there's no 'grip' on the inside to hug (for example) a cast iron handle. I'd suggest them more for stainless steel pot handles, rather than low-lying skillets (proximity to flame.)Again, a little bit of user error there, but given the choice, I'd choose silicone!"
3,"ok, burns easy","I use mine for a short time and the blue one started scorching on the end closest to the handle. I would have hoped that they would be more heat resistant. They still work fine, but next time I'm going to buy the Max Temp handle."
4,They work but...,"I would definitely recommend getting a standard-sized mitt or holder in addition. These are only for the handles. Because you are cooking with cast iron, the pan gets heavy and sometimes you will want to grab the opposite side of the pan. You will need something more for those situations. That being said, these do work very well protecting your hands and are quite comfortable to use."
2,Protects from heat... until it catches fire,I got these to go with my lodge logic cast iron pans... They do a good job of insulating the heat... until they catch fire.
2,Burned on first use!,"I don't write reviews often but I had to for this one. The mitt works ok as long as the heat is not on. When the gas stove was heating up my cast iron skillet, these mitts starting melting and burning. They fit perfect but are not much use if I have to remove them when I'm cooking. Wish they were better!"
5,A must have...,"...whether you own a Lodge or other cast iron skillet, pan, etc., this handle holder is ""A must have."" Slip it on over the handle and forget about it. You don't need a oven glove or a hot pad, so it's easy to control the skillet while cooking, indoors or out. When out RVing, I cook a lot of meals outdoors, and you can be sure that I have several of these on hand over my skillet and combo cooker. Yours should too... Enjoy Cooking!"
1,blocks the heat but singes,"Bought 2 of these. they're great at blocking the handle heat but if you push them on the handle all the way, they singe or burn, even if the flame isn't wider than your pan. it's unfortunate..."
5,"Despite user error, they work well","I, like many other reviewers, charred both of these during the first week. I had the mits on the handles when I ignited my gas stove, and whoosh, they burned the edges. I attribute this to user error, though. These Handle-holders should only be used to move the pans around, take them out of the oven, etc. I learned my lesson and now keep them *next to* the stove, using them only when I need to touch the handles. They work like a charm. Just use some common sense ;)"
1,not happy,"really disappointed....not sure how something that barely fits on your finger is considered a pot holder, tried to return and was happy to get credit!"
4,Serve there purpose,They serve there purpose. The red holder is a vibrant red and good quality. I'd recommend purchasing the hot handle holders.
5,Great Accessory,"Purchesed this set, along with a 12"" Lodge Pre-seasoned skillet for a Christmas gift. I kept one and gave the other with the skillet. These fit great over the skillet handles, no slippage, just remember, they should never be left on while cooking, especially on a gas stove with open flame. Thanks Lodge & Amazon for completing a Christmas package."
3,Not my definition of greatest,"The TARDIS is traversing the vortex when its defences are penetrated by an advertising satellite. Inviting whoever receives is to visit the Psychic Circus, they decide to do so. But they aren't the only ones - a wide number of odd characters are on their way. But the Psychic Circus has a dark secret, one from which some of the circus performers are keen to escape...One of the stories of the Seventh Doctor normally labelled ""oddball"", this story takes what might otherwise be a normal one and gives it an odd spin. Part of this odd spin are the characters who are, depending on your views, either archetypal or clichéd.For my money, the story is just that much too shallow to be enjoyable."
4,good reading,good reading.........all three books are good. Make sure to read them in order. I hope you enjoy reading all of them.
4,More Brides!,I was playing pleasantly surprised by this book. I got caught up in the story so quickly. It's a fast read. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
4,Good one,"Got this one as a filler book one day. I hadn't read Cheryl Bolen before, but have since. I decided to get the rest in the series since I liked this one so well."
4,Actual suspenseful and charming writing,"Although one might predict how the novel ends, it was nonetheless quick, witty, sensual, ertotic, and a glance into the historical past of society in England and customs."
4,could have been a 5 star,"Over all, I loved the book. The only thing preventing me to give it 5 stars: I thought the heroine waffled too long."
5,Excellent author,"Enjoyed this book as a light, romantic historical novel. In fact, I have purchased all the Kindle books for this author. Easy reading, great story line and when you're finished, you feel that you've read a story, not a ""lust"" novel . . . I enjoy this author a lot."
4,nanakindlebooks,This is a fun and enchanting fiction. I enjoy the period of time that the story takes place and the romance was fun and entertaining.
3,Predictable,"This is a good book for what it is. The characters are intruging and although it is predictable its its still good. This book itsn't the best but by no means is it the worst. I recommend this nice ""fluffy' book as a nice break and its great for light reading."
2,Dicen que participa Fripp,"Dicen que en este disco participa Robert Fripp. Creanmé, ese es todo el aliciente que tiene este CD rutinario y machacón."
5,Exactly what I Ordered,"My Granite Ware 13 Inch Covered Oval Roster was easy to order, came quicker than I expected and turned out to be exactly what I wanted. Great job."
5,Sized perfectly,"This is the medium size roaster. Cleans up easily and sized for large roaster chicken. Found a good price on Amazon and it included free shipping, couldn't go wrong"
3,Edges a little sharp.,The edges are a little sharp. It is significantly smaller inside than the 13 inch dimension suggests and it is proportionately less high.
4,Hooray! Made in the USA!,"Actually, I meant to get the smaller 15"" roaster to replaced the one that died (after 20 years) because it turned out that I already have the 18"". Oh well, the one I have is nearly 20 years old, so it's time for a replacement. I prefer roasting turkeys in these types of roasters because the meat bastes itself, making it juicy and browned naturally. Plus it's great to find bakeware made in the USA and a great price. Works for me!"
5,Just What I Wanted,This item was exactly what I was looking for. It can hold up to a 5 lb bird easily. It's also great for roasting my potatoes and vegetables. I will definitely get another small one and maybe get one one size up from this one.
1,Harold Imports Oval Roasting Pan,"I received this pan in terrible condition. It was chipped in several places on the inside and outside. This includes both the lid and the roasting pan. I would not order from this company again. I would send it back but the costs to send it back to receive a replacement would just be more money lost on this roaster. The thing that I really found interesting was that there was no evidence of the roasting pan being chipped in shipping it appeared that the company sent it chipped. The pan is not usable. I will not order from this company in the future.This item is ordered from Harold Imports but sold by Westview Traders, Inc, 6835 Buckeye Road, Phoenix, Az 85043.Rita Morrison"
4,Fantastic little roaster,"I love this tiny roaster!Just cooking for one or two you can't beat this size.Great for Pork Loin, small Chicken or a small dinner ham.and there is still enough room for roasted carrots and potatoes around them.It's pefect for a casarole too.For the money you can't beat it.I HAVE BEEN PRAYING THEY WILL MAKE IT STAINLESS STEEL!As I've wore 3 of them out already in 15 years.Between acidic foods, making gravy on the stove top in it and the dishwasher at some point they always get a pin hole in them.With the number of single people and senior's it would be worth it to make this little gem in Stainless.It's one of the most used pans I own.If you're just cooking for one or two, this is a must have..... even if you do have to replace it EVERY 5 YEARS."
2,I have sent mine back due to measurement issues,"I was very disappointed once I received this product. It is far smaller than I had anticipated. I should have read the reviews a little bit closer since some of them did mention the measurements. The measurements include the handles rather than just the cooking area, which makes a huge difference in the amount of total cooking space. There were also two chips on the pan, which would have caused some issues once I washed the pan. I sent it back and ordered the large rectangular pan instead, which should supply the cooking area that I require. I am sure this product is useful for small turkeys and roasts but I wish the measurements would have been a bit more accurate or at least stipulated in the description that the length included the handles. I will order this brand again but I will not buy this particular pan for my needs. Happy cooking!!"
3,Observations using this roasting pan.,"Granite Ware 18-Inch Covered Oval RoasterHandles are a good size easy to gripCover fits very wellThe pan is very thin, I found you have to watch closely what you are cooking as it tends to catch on easily. Not sure I would suggest it to someone just learning how to cook.Price is fineDelivery as always with Amazon very fast."
5,18-inch roaster is 15 inches inside,"One thing to keep in mind with this and other Granite Ware roasters is that the dimension given is the outside one, including the handles. The ""18-inch"" one is just 15 inches inside (long dimension). Be sure to buy the 18-inch one if you want to cook a turkey rather than a chicken. You can fit a turkey up to about 22 lb. in it. (Tip: wrap the turkey completely in foil after stuffing and cook at 400 degrees uncovered; sample time, 4 hours for 17-19 lb. turkey. Peel back the foil for the last 15 minutes to brown. No basting, works every time!) This item does say USA on it, so I hope it will last for years, like our old one."
2,Disappointing Quality,"This item arrived with a small dent in the rim of the lid. The roaster was of a much thinner gauge than other granite ware products I own. Due to its' low cost, I did not feel that it was worth the time and effort to return. I was, however, disappointed with the purchase."
5,Perfect size for small roast.,Just what I wanted...to cook small roasts & game hens (2).Cooks fast and cleans up easily! Good Price!Like it alot! Thank You Amazon!
2,Mini birds?,"Okay, ""A chicken in every pot"" but its unlikely even in the '30s the President had Cornish Hens in mind which is all that would fit in this mini roaster. I'm thinking 13"" looooong will surely fit my turkey that is big enough to feed 6+ people. What the heck, its not worth the aggravation sending this back and the way this economy is going I may be using it to roast a regulation size turkey in a year or two that should fit in this pan real nice. Happy holidays to all!"
3,Avianne prescott review,"This pan is lovely,but pretty small,when i bought it i was mad,crazy it was so small i could not even bake a small chicken in it.it is really,really small.so sorry i didn't buy a big one first."
2,Not as described,"The item description stated that it had been listed as a used Item because of the damaged packaging, but the item itself was good. Which is wrong. The the cover of the roaster was damaged -- though slightly, it did affect tightness of closure.I returned the purchase."
1,Cheaper at wal mart,Recieved on time but only to go to wal Mary where it was several dollars cheaper that's my fault for not shopping around... Wouldn't had to wait for shipping
1,Damaged,"Arrived with a large, 5 inch long dent on the lip, preventing the lid from sitting right and exposing the bare metal beneath the enamel. The metal is protected only by the enamel, so it would rust in nothing flat. Packaged well by Amazon, so I assume the defect is from the factory."
1,no refund,I sent this back with a return authorization and never got a refund do buy from Amazon!!!!!!!!!
5,The good ol' days!,"I remembered as a child that my mom used to own a granite roaster and figured I needed a pot for my turkey this Thanksgiving. I was so tired of using aluminum foil! Well, needless to say that Walmart was selling a cheap poorly made pot and I ran to amazon to purchase this one. Not only is it made here, but no defects either. I have to say it is the best roaster ever! My turkey came out juicy and browned without having to uncover it. It cooks fast, too! I absolutely love it and will never use any other roaster again."
3,Chipped after two uses,"I was REALLY excited to buy this b/c it reminded me of the roaster my grandma always had and used. I ordered it right before Easter and had it in time for my big Easter dinner. I roasted my ham in it . I hand washed it then used it only one more time for another ham. When hand washing it for only the second time there was a chuck of the finish missing in the bottom of the inside of the roaster about the size of a quarter. I was so disappointed. I wanted this to be a life long pan I could pass on to my family some day. I bought the roasting pan that is recommended to go with this and if that chipped it, then shame on them for recommending a product that could chip the roaster. Other then that I have no idea what could've chipped this. Shipped mine back."
2,"This roaster is cheap (not inexpensive), and you get what you pay for.","I ordered this 18-inch roaster, and it arrived severely damaged. The handle had been pushed into the body, knocking off the porcelain coating off inside and outside the roaster. I returned it, and the replacement was only minorly damaged. The packing seemed sound, but a small area at the inside of the handle had chipped porcelain revealing the metal core. After one use the metal core was already showing rust. Due to the low price I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. If I had paid more, I'd be more upset.I'll definitely be going to a department store to replace this one."
2,TRUTH.......NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,"SMALL, TINY, Very SHARP!!SHARP!!SHARP EDGES. If not careful, will be bleeding from SHARP EDGES with each use. Deserves one star; however, will give 2 stars because is a good size for one or two people cooking(Cannot hold a whole chicken unless it is a cornish hen) and lid almost fits tight. Inside measurements are 10 1/2"" X 6 3/4"". Cannot believe how thin the material and CANNOT REITERATE HOW SHARP ALL THE EDGES ARE; EVEN THE LID EDGES ARE SHARP. Made nothing like the old roasting pans of our mothers/grandmothers. Like other viewer, will see how long it last. It might surprise us."
3,okay quality,"I was a little disappointed with this roaster's overall quality- I've only used it once and the coating is already chipping off the lip. Also, it came with the lid taped on with cheap, flimsy packing tape that would not come off!"
1,Poor Quality - arrived damaged,"Arrived today. Item not as heavy as previous roasters I've purchased over the years. It's damaged and I think it's not because of transit problems. I believe it was damaged before it went into the shipping box. There is a ""chip"" the size of the end of your index finger on the bottom in the inside of the roaster pan. There is also a corresponding chip in the same place on the outside of the bottom of the pan which means there is very little material in between and there will be a hole at some point in the near future. Highly disappointed. Threw my money away on this item."
2,flimsy,This is a pretty flimsy piece of a tin can with a cover. It's not like the one I remember from the old days.
5,The best roasting pan in the world!,"This roasting pan replaces the one that got accidently given away on moving day. No matter what meat got roasted in it, it came out perfect. I finally replaced it when I found my pot roasts weren't coming out like I was used to in my fancy new roaster. Cleanup is a snap too. Don't waste your money on the others. This is the best roasting pan at any price. I also suggest getting a rack to fit. This is my preference now, but it isn't absolutely necessary because I used my old one for over 25 years without one."
2,"13"" product is not like the description","the 13"" version is very small. the 13"" is the measurement from lip to lip and not the actual capacity of the roasting pan. unless you have a very small roast, get a larger version."
1,"Handles were loose, returned it immediately-","I could tell right away the handles were loose, when I removed it from the box and checked it out. Wasn't confident about using it and removing heavy food items in this out of the oven after this is heated... I returned it and ordered another brand and product, more expensive but sometimes you have to do what you have to do."
1,Arrived damaged - returned,"I bought this roaster because it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen, but it arrived damaged with two gouges in the exterior. I was in a pinch for a holiday dinner and was going to use it anyway, but within hours after washing it started to rust. It feels lightweight as well and didn't fit my roasting rack."
3,Dimensions are inaccurate,"I bought the 15-in to use for a water bath for a cheesecake in a springform pan. The dimensions indicate that this item is 15.6 x 10.1 x 3.2 inches. However, it does not specify that the narrowest part of the oval shape is actually only about 8 inches (not 10.1), so it was too small to fit my 9-in circumference springform cake pan."
3,Lighter weight than Grandma's roaster!,"It looks the same as the classic roaster, the size is the same, but this roaster is very thin. I was a bit disappointed, but it was a good deal on Amazon, and still better than buying disposable aluminum."
3,Disappointed,The dimension given in the description is misleading. Eighteen inches includes the handles; the packaging is inadequate as the product arrived with a dent in one of the handles. The metal is thin when compared to one we have had for years. Do not expect to get a robust piece of cookware. It is usable and that is all that can be said in it's favor.
5,Wonderful roaster!,"I am sooooo glad I bought this roaster! I have been looking for one this size for some time. I am glad I found it! I use this to roast chickens and I must say they come out ""golden brown"" instead of a bland gray color from being ""steamed"" in other covered roasters! This one is just like Grandma had. It is somewhat thinner in construction than Grandma's, but what isn't these days? I have used it several times already and I haven't had a problem yet! I would definitely buy it again and again!!!"
1,Please read before you buy!,"This 13 inch roaster is tiny, cheaply made and sharp. The actual measurements are about 10 1/2 x 6 1/2 inches. The small roasting rack (10x6) will not fit in the bottom of the pan. I am returning it and will look for something better."
2,"This is not an 18"" Roaster",This is not an 18 inch roaster as advertised. It is only 16inches. I could have purchase this smaller one at Target
1,misleading title,"I ordered this thinking it was a ten pack (as the title says) but it was only a single DVD+R. What a deal, since after shipping I paid almost seven dollars for this one disc. Dispute still pending.Update- Cyberguys! quickly and cheerfully refunded my shipping charges at my request leaving my total cost at only 99 cents for the DVD+R."
3,Review,"This is a reprint of an older book. However, the pages look like someone xeroxed them from the older book, rather than being a nice reprinting. If I had it to do over again, I would go with the newer book."
5,Essential for your J Mascis Collection,"This is a unique look at J's first acoustic show ever. It's not very long and is similar to his Martin + Me album from '96. This was recorded in 12/03, the year Where You Been came out. J's really friendly in this too. He must have been in front of a lot friends or know the crowd really well. So give it a listen and see what you think."
5,1225: an endearing composition,"Lenny Castellaneta has created two very real worlds, charactors who are all quite believable, an intriguing story line, and an unforgettable experience. Mr. Castellaneta is one of those writers with the ability to graft into his tale the little pieces of life that we all experience (often mundane), making his world all the more real without coming across like an immature writer where the writing is obviously too much about the author. I am not a fan of first person books; so the author has to make the craft super attractive or I am gone. Mr. Castellaneta's tale has me hooked; I want more. I do hope he will carry on the theme, perhaps only losely attached to the first set of characters--but that is his call. He is the maestro; not me."
2,It's a shame this is the only available RM-ODP book.,"This book will prevent all but the hardiest of souls from adopting RM-ODP, which is a shame since RM-ODP presents so much that is useful to the architect.You are much better off learning RM-ODP from the ITU Reccomendations than this book.If you are already familiar with RM-ODP this book does contain some useful nuggets of information--if you are willing to dig hard enough to find them.Ms. Putnam's book is disorganized and prolix. It is appalling that she quotes herself in the front matter. ""Architechting with RM-ODP"" is neither of use to the beginner or valuable as a reference to the practitioner."
1,Waste of Money,I looked for a book that was specifically devoted to Jacobean Furniture as I make reproduction furniture for a hobby. This was the only one I could find. It is reproduction of a book originally published in 1923. It appears as though it is a very bad photocopy of an original. The reproduction is so bad that the captions for images are unintelligible. What is worse is that it provides very few of illustrations of actual pieces of furniture. What is in the book is easily found in publications devoted to William and Mary or 18th Century American Furniture. The text is quaint but lacks the kind of attention to detail that would be helpful to a reproducer. It might be interesting to someone who was interested in an elementary introduction to the style. I would definitely not recommend this book.
5,Love this item,"I usually don't use cages but decided it would be great for the moms who jump out of the playpens. I love these Jumbo small animal cages. I don't have to bend over to deal with mom or pups inside, I have room for their beds, and their litterbox and food and water. So easy to move around with the wheels. I am hoping to buy a couple more in the next couple of months. I would highly recommend these to everyone. I actually put a piece of vinyl over the wire mesh on the bottom because I didnt' want the pups feet to get in the holes and I use the plastic tray underneath to store food and potty pads, etc.... LOVE LOVE LOVE these."
2,Poor Choice,"I bought this cage for my two rabbits (who are in no way large) and after about 6-8 months the cage started to fall apart. The bed pan in the cage began to warp so that it no longer fir the frame properly, the base later came apart, and two of the wheels fell off and were impossible to get back on for any period of time.I was very excited to have purchased this for my furry little friends, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a waste of time and effort."
1,Do not buy this cage!,"I bought this cage for my 2 guinea pigs because it was a great size for them and was on a stand. However, the first week I had it, one of the screws came loose and would not screw back in. This made the whole cage loose. The bottom repeatedly fell out of it thus bending the bars supporting the side and cracking the bottom. Two months of this and the cage is completely broken! I'm going to buy a new one tonight. Please save yourself the trouble and money and get a different cage."
4,good beginners cage,"I bought this for my two mini lops. The cage is attractive, has a deep base in it, and rolls on its own stand. It was fairly simple to put together, although if you are over 40, you will need your magnifying glasses to read the instructions. There is a wire bottom, top and side doors. The base pulls out for easy cleaning. The cage is at chair height, making it easy to sit and pet my bunnies! I don't know about the long term useage yet, but it seems well made."
2,Don't buy it!,"This MP3 player is the bottom of the line. 2 AA (not AAA like toys r us says) batteries last about one hour, and the maximum volume is about 1/4 the maximum volume on a normal cd player. In order to put more than two songs on it, you have to decrease the bitrate to 32kbps (which means the songs sound like they're coming from a bad AM radio). I'm returning mine to the store today!The bottom line is: If you're going to buy an MP3 player, don't get this one. ... The KBGear JAMP3 Player is a total waste of money, Don't buy it!"
1,~HORRIBLE~!!!! Worst MP3 I've seen yet.....,"Lets not even get started people. In simple this is just an mp3 not meant for ANYONE over 7. It just has LOW quality sound and the volume is poor. Go with something a tiny bit more exspensive...trust me it may be more exspensive for you, but in time you will thank me."
2,DONOT BUY IF U HAVE XP,If u have Windows XP save ur self some time and not buy this. I spent 3 hours trying to configure it to Xp settings and ended up with 2 songs on it. The program is to hard to use!!!!! Its a good value but a waist of time. I would go with the SAMSUNG Yeep. Its super easy to use but it only holds 35 mbs. It would make a good first mp3 player. If u want more memory go with The Creative Nomad II
2,Not what we expected...!,"Disappointed, this is just a toy for small children. The quality of the sound is not that good at all. It eats up the beginning of the songs sometimes. Bought a D-link MP3 player and What a difference!!!You dont get what you pay with this one. Get a D-Link DMP instead,they are higher quality engineering, and look Cool!!!...or even a Rio is little better!"
1,Piece Of Junk!,"The Jamp3 was given to me as a gift. And I have found that it has the following problems:-Software is difficult to use and very inefficient. It causesthe computer to crash quit often.-Very Short Battery Life. With the two AA's you only getabout an hours use out of the thing. Not to mention that halfyour battery life is spent down loading the music. I modifiedmy unit to work off a 2 D cell battery pack. This is the onlyway to get any practical use out of the thing.-Very Slow Down Loads. It takes about as much time to download each song as it would play. I added a 16 Meg MMC Card, andit takes about twenty five minutes to load a half hours worthOf music.-Song Menu Contains Only Six Characters. It is difficult to make a selection when all the song titles in the download menu are compressed into six characters.Over all I rate the JamP3 as an inferior product. Yes it does play MP3's, but it's not worth the inconveniences."
5,A great mp3 player,"It isnt the very best player out there , but for the price it is amazing. After rebates it was a measly price. Wow you cant get much better than that. The volume could go up a notch but for the price who cares. The memory is kinda small, but with money you save on the player, you can afford to upgrade it. It is definetly a great starter player."
3,JamP3,"This Player is not as good as people say it is. First of all, my PC will not let me get the songs into my player. The Manual is missing directions and you can only download songs from 2 Websites. Over all i say this product is ok But could be way better."
1,La Adolescencia,"This is not a person to purchase from, as I have been charged for this item but it has never been received.PLEASE do not purchase any items from this person!"
2,sky dance disappoints,"Not as good as expected. Image clarity was below avg. Objects in motion had ""saw-tooth edge"" appearance. The other DVD I ordered was just fine. Maybe I need HDMI output which my DVD player doesn't have."
4,Happy with it but needs minor modification,"Tender is really a convenient, useful product which satisfied my requirements. However, if it could be a little more thick - with less liquid in it, I would be much happy. Thanks to the producer."
5,Works really well.,"This product shipped all the way from Canada so it took some time before I received it. It is a nice product. Works very well on leather. Whether the leather is cheap or expensive, this lotion will revive the leather back to life. It is not oily or too thin. It has a nice consistency, just like a lotion you would apply to your skin. It's a good buy. If you don't know what else to buy, buy this lotion."
5,PERFECT!!! TY TY TY,"I was recently put in a wheelchair. This basket makes it possible for me to carry my own cart. I am so grateful to you for this. I do love to shop and with this, I can shop on my own. I don't need help getting things up to the cash register or out to the car. TY"
5,Best book I've read on the subject ever!,I read this book in 1989 and it changed my whole life so much I gave copies of it away for two years. Recovering from living with a dysfunctional family doesn't happen overnight. I highly reccommend all of the author's work on the subject and am very grateful that I found this book first.
5,The Best Book on Recovering from Dysfunctional Families,"I've read about a dozen books lately on various aspects of the lives and recovery of adult children of dysfunctional families, and this is by far the best. I agree with other reviewers that the ""inner child"" concept is a bit hokey, but the author here doesn't rely on it as an actual separate personality, but rather as a useful metaphor for getting in touch with the anger, shame, and other feelings we were not allowed to express as children. The book recommends many new ways of thinking about things and strategies for dealing with toxic people in our lives, and I believe that any therapist working with adults who had traumatic or difficult childhoods should read it and use the techniques with their clients. This will be a permanent part of my library as I move through my recovery and reclaiming of myself."
2,Not for the average person,I thought this was hard to follow and written more for a psychologist than an average person.
1,Item still not received,I still have not received this item. The address they were sent to was incorrect. I sent an email to the merchant asking that they be resent to the correct address but have not heard back.
1,bored me,"this book may have helped others, but it severely bored me. i had and extremely disturbed childhood. this book was just too basic for me, i dont feel it was written very well at all."
1,"Good theory, lacking in practicality",This is the kind of information my therapist of 4 years spewed...then I found one who offered practical guidework and here I am...a healed child.
1,Missing pages,I received this book which was in okay condition and I began reading the book I noticed that there are missing pages and I have not been able to locate this book just yet.... Buyer beware!!!!
2,Other books are better,"This book is geared towards people who are unaware that they came from disfunctional families (with emphasis on alcohol abuse). If you have already come to the conclusion that your family was disfunctional and begun the healing process this book is remedial. There is a large emphasis on alcohol dependancy and abuse which I could not relate to. The book should be retitled ""Healing The Child Within: Discovery and Recovery for Adult Children of Alcoholic and Dysfunctional Families"" I felt that the book ""Getting The Love You Want"" by Harville Hendrix was more interesting and provided additional opportunities for discovery and growth."
4,Healing the inner Child,I am learning more each day about who I truly am and where I would like to be as a parent and person.
2,I've read better,"The book has a good idea behind it. And it makes some good points. But I found it much more difficult to read that many other books of this type. Not ""hard"" difficult or anything like that. Difficult in the sense that the book just never caught my attention the way that other self help books have and I really had to force myself to keep reading. I don't think I got as much out of it as I could have simply because I had such a hard time paying attention."
4,Dee Lundgren @ top counselor,"As a licensed professional counselor I highly recommend this book for its straightforward approach in healing for adults who have come from dysfunctional families. It is especially helpful in understanding the role of grief work and the pitfalls for those who deny their feelings or minimize their pain. This short book concisely works through the start to finish of adult healing of childhood traumas. This book is a help for both clinicians and lay people alike. However, it is not a substitute for individual or group therapy."
2,"Right Tittle, Wrong Content","I bought this book four years ago, based on the tittle. Technically, the author probably knows his stuff. The way information is conveyed is so dry and inaccessable that I found it very hard to connect with. Think of a college professor who kills your favorite subject with his sterile personality. This year, I bought ""Bradshaw On: The Family"" by John Bradshaw. This is the book I needed four years ago! If you are going to invest your time and energy on inner healing, you deserve better than Whitfield's book. I offer this review in the hope that in some small way I can make a positive contribution to someone else's inner journey."
3,"untried, but looks sturdy",This item looks a bit awkward to use and I am not sure what size of nails it will drive but it looks very clever and simple to use. It is kind of like using a slingshot; pull back and let the spring pound the nail.I will try it some day soon. One handed people could not use it.JL
2,Nothing new!,"Frankly, this book brings nothing new. We already know everything there is to know about Jackie and Diana don't we? I sincerely regret having paid such a high price to read what I already knew! I found the book ""Mrs. Kennedy"" much much more interesting."
2,Missed Opportunity,"The premise of this book was intriguing and so promising. Sadly, the research appears to be very poor indeed....inconsistencies, light weight and superficial. I was surprised that it wasn't better."
1,Biggest piece of junk,"I wouldn't even clean my car with this item. It originally sells for $250 dollars!!! You have to be kidding me...the $40 I spent for it was $35 too much. Its not even worth the aggravation of returning it, which is probably how they make money off this product. STAY AWAY!"
2,Poor quality Especially for Lodge,Received item well packaged from Amazon. Two places on basket had broken or missing wires. I ran it through the dishwasher before using it. The basket came out with rust everywhere the fine wire is welded long the support frame and the handle. I brought from lodge expecting better quality than this. This is what I would expect from a cheap China import. I figure I'll have to find a replacement within a year of use.
3,Folds up out of the way...,While the other reviewers don't like the basket I actually like it and don't find anything wrong with it. It fits the 7qt lodge dutch oven I have great and folds out of the way as I keep it in the pot which makes for easy travel. If you have the 7qt dutch oven from Lodge this is a perfect fit.
3,Wow! Read it or else!,"If you only read one book about stress, this isn't it. But it's good for the price and I learned quite a bit about myself...mostly stuff i didn't want to know!"
1,Takes Your Money and Doesn't send the Magazine,I can't figure out this magazine company. They put out a good magazine but don't ever subscribe because you won't see an issue. I paid for a 3 year subscription and spent 2 years writing them to ask about my issues. I even sent them a copy of the money order I used to pay for the issues. I was completely ignored. There's just no excuse for taking people's money. Do not subscribe to this magazine!!!
