1,4 year olds laughed at this more than they laugh at clowns,"if you thought this was scarie, or it made you jump out of your seat, then if someone farts you would jump. this movie and the 1st one are movies based around the whole ""did you hear that"" kinda thing. so if you watch it with the sound off, it will put you to sleep."
5,Great seller service.,Great video for the price. Enjoyed the show. My wife loves to watch the paranormal shows and we wanted to finish the series.
1,Paraboring Activity 2,"This movie is dull and boring. I feel asleep numerous times. Watch a different horror film like the Shining, Rosemary's Baby, or What to Expect When You're Expecting."
4,Creepy and Scary Moments,"At times, it's repetitive with the camera shots and you sit there wondering when something is going to happen...and eventually things start to happen. Its definately scary at times..has that make u jump factor to it. I enjoyed it."
1,Now that I'm an hour closer to death I feel cheated...,"What do I think of this movie, you ask? A complete and utter snooze fest! I can honestly say the only thing that kept me from dozing off was the intermittent shrieks from the teenaged girls in the audience. Scariest movie ever made? What a knee slapper! The plot of this film was almost non existent since 90% of the entire thing was just afterhour footage of the pool, the bedroom and the dog. Sure there was a startling moment here or there but being startled is completely different from being scared. The only scary part of this entire hogwash of a movie is how this trend of homemade-video-movie hybrid crap will keep rearing it's ugly head in theaters. Trust me, you will have more fun watching Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth""."
1,Only because,"You have to give it one star to review it...This movie was by far one of the worst movies ive ever seen.it was worse then the first one...nothing happend for I dunno the first hour...i almost turned it off like 5 times...the only person I felt bad for wasnt even a person it was the dog..i wont watch the next one...just awfull..ud think this day and age hollywood could do better..when she got dragged down the stairs twice, I mean sure it was the same demon from the first movie so it made sense but still. If u like scary movies like I do...then dont waste ur time on this one."
1,Save Your Money and skip this one,"As a die-hard Sci Fi fan I was anxious to see this movie. I suffered through it in the theater, waiting for my date to admit it was a waste of money so we could leave early. It was not to be, I suffered through the whole boring film. It has no redeeming value. Acting is bland, story is weak, special effects are minimal, nice dog and a good size kitchen for those into real estate. Don't waste your money."
4,A nice prequel,"For me, this was much more intersting to watch (less boring) than the first film.Plus - this is one of the best prequels I have ever seen. It's worth a watch especially if you like the first one."
2,One of the bext comedies of the year...,"I haven't laughed this hard since the Hangover. The producers wasted an opportunity to make a decent movie by wasting the first 55 minutes and then making the rest so laughable I couldn't take it seriously.If you DO choose to see this, skip the 56 minute mark and enjoy the laughs."
2,Don't waste your money......,"This film was so dull I scanned a good deal of it on fast forward. I think the characters only seemed scared because the actors knew what this movie would do to their careers.The only reason it got 2 stars is because I have seen a few FIMBY's (Filmed In My Back Yard) & Italian films that were worse. It wasn't bad in that regard as that was the intentional style and was not done poorly, but not much happened and there wasn't an actual plot. The whole story could have been a 1/2 hr show on TV and would have been better.I love horror movies, but this wasn't scary or intriguing in any way."
4,Different and Okay,"It was good for the scare here and there. The volume has to be way up so when things are loud, you will jump. Only part I really didn't like was the end."
3,Predictable due to the first one,"The first one really got under my skin with the dynamic of being attacked and not even safe in one's own bed and having been stalked by a demon since childhood. That said, the fact that the family in the first film is connected to the family in this one takes away a lot of potential suspense.It is still horrifying to watch the demonic force attack the dog and move the toddler out of his crib in the middle of the morning, though, and you want to smack the dad in the head for being obtuse and not listening to his wife's and daughter's concerns about what goes on in their house.Good enough to rent but not to buy."
3,Road sign on the path to how we got to the first movie,"This movie is the second installment in this franchise. It provides some backstory on what happened in the first movie, which is that the sister's husband places the hex on the girl who kills her boy toy. But only because their is some link to their family history many many years ago. It is well done, but begins to drag at many points. It just seems to work too hard at fitting in with the first movie, which makes it a little bit disjointed overall. In sum, not a bad movie, but not a very good one either."
2,Well...,"Funny scene where they are supposingly looking on a laptop for information, yet it's not even on.I think the reason why many people don't find this one as scary is because they know it isnt real. There was so much hype and speculation about the first, it really bummed people out when they found out the truth. Still not as many ""events"" going on as in the first. The first was much better. Still a unique new way to bring ""horror"" to the screen.Side note. I want that house."
1,Terrible,"Like watching paint dry. Super low budget, boring. Off camera noise and moving furniture is not scary. Costs only 5 million to make, and I swear that seems high."
1,Yawn,Really rather boring. The first PA held my interest and I found the mysterious tone captivating. Not so this one. Yawn. . .
3,Good but not great,"I guess my title sums up my feeling towards the whole line-up...they're good but not great horror movies. The movies did not keep my full attention for 1.5 hours, which is an indication of a weaker story line because I do love a great horror flick (and realize that we are not dealing with Oscar award winning scripts, which typically put me to sleep)..."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever paid to see. The plot (or lack there of) is terrible. Absolutly nothing paranormal happens in the first hour of the movie. The scariest thing about this movie is the fact that I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching it. Do yourself a favor and save your money."
1,"Piece of trash movie, absolutely no scares at all","You might as well sit down and watch a security cam monitor for 91 minutes. One of the most disappointing ""movies"" I've ever watched. Please do not fall for the hype."
1,Awful..,So glad I never paid for this. Had to be for ME the dumbest unscarest movie I have ever seen
2,It was okay but,"This movie isn't real. It's actually done in a Hollywood set and uses ""footage"" to convince people that this is actual footage. In the credits at the end of the movie it clearly says that this isn't a good movie.If this movie had actual footage, then sure it would shock me like it's shocking a lot of people. But now that I know it's fake, the whole point of this movie is pretty much destroyed. There's really no point in watching it unless you want to pretend this is actually happening.If you want fantasy scary movies, there's a lot better titles out there that are scarier."
4,"I like this series, so far",I think this is just as good if not better than the first. It adds a bit more background info and is scary.
3,Not bad for what it purports,"It has it's chilling moments but I didn't really find it scary, though it was better than the first movie."
2,First one was better,"It really looks like a B movie. They don't make Halloween, scary movies like the used to. I wanted more dialogue, and better photography."
3,"dont believe the hype, just OK..","Not sure why most everyone says how scary this was compared to the first one and people jumping out of their seats etc. Maybe that was my problem, I believed all the hype and then was let down. The movie is about a scary as the first one. It was very slow at times and I was dozing off in the theatre, out of boredom, not being tired.It picks up a bit towards the end but it was just ok.The movie used loud noises as it's primary way to scare you which I find lame. Also, the dog hardly barked at anything. I have two shepherds and they would not have acted like Abby, who seemed to never notice any of the loud booms and bangs in that house.I'll give it 3 stars to be kind."
5,Loved it!,This movie was SO scary! It looks so real! I absolutely love it! And I love Amazon.com. Nothing ever takes too long to get to me!
3,Pretty Creepy!!!,"I still haven't seen the original, but my friends wanted me to see this with them. There were a few scenes that will make you jump and scream. This movie is sort of a prequel and sequel combined to the characters of the original. After their house is robbed, the sister of Katie and her family put up cameras all around their house. It starts off slow, but things gradually get scarier. I would probably recommend PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2!!!"
3,Not much left to do after the first,"Depicting the events leading up to Paranormal Activity, PA 2 tells the story of Katie's [Katie Featherston] sister, Kristi [Sprague Grayden and husband, Dan [Brian Boyland], their daughter, Ali [Molly Ephraim] and their infant son Hunter. The demonic events chronicled in PA started in Kristi and Dan's house several weeks before. There are thumps and bumps, objects moving on their own, and a eerie basement that fascinates the demon, who seems focused on Hunter. Dan refuses to believe the goings-on are supernatural, but Kristi and Ali are convinced. As the demon's activity escalates, we learn how the events in PA began.This sequel works in some ways, but,ultimately, given that we know what the outcome will be from PA, the events are anti-climactic and the slow pacing that worked well in PA grows tedious in PA2. Worth seeing if you are a PA fan, as it fills in some of the backstory of PA, though not enough as we would like."
4,"Minus one star because it's a sequel, other than that...","Although I thought the novelty had worn off after Blair Witch, Session 9 (undiscovered classic) and the first Paranormal Activity, this ""found footage film"" really got to me. Although I liked Rec, I didn't care for The Last Broadcast or Clover Field (I figure it's kinda bad when you root for the monster) It's fair when people compare this film to the first, absolutely fair. This one didn't scare me as much as the first, but the tension and suspense was much greater. I'm not a fan of the mythology they seem to have created, but only because it seemed to come out of the need to create a series of films rather than actual organic storytelling. With a lesser quality film I would have no quibble. Which is good and bad. Anyway, this movie scares you, builds tension to nearly unbearable levels, serves as both a prequel and epilogue to the first film, and leaves you wanting more. As you lie awake sleepless that first night of viewing."
2,Doesn't Compare,The first one was waaay better. The whole connecting them together was kinda cool but the scares and especially the ending were laaaaaame!
4,A good sequel,"A young family is being frightened in their home by spirits in this prequel to Paranormal Activity, one of the most intriguing films of 2009. The storyline revolves around the action in the original, with the haunting from Katie's childhood now returning to terrorize the family of her stepsister. The same documentary style that brought an eerie realism the first is used here, and remains effective. The sense of discovery present in the original is diluted, but overall the follow-up is worthy of its predecessor."
1,Boring.........................,"The first one was fairly scary, but this one was pathetic. Not scary and took FOREVER to get anywhere. Don't waste your time....."
3,Wasn't As Good As The First One.....But I Still Enjoyed It!,"I thought the first Paranormal Activity was an excellent film. While watching Paranormal Activity 2, I thought it was very similar in the plot development. I felt as though the plot was a little slow but the finish was good. In the first film, I enjoyed the alternate ending better because I felt as though it really made the film end in a WOW! This film lacked that Wow factor at the end but it did leave a nice tie in which I thought was creative. If you didn't like the first movie I don't think that you would enjoy this one either. If you enjoyed the first film and are looking to jump out of your seat I feel this is the film for you."
3,Not happy with it.,I ordered Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Activity 2. The first movie worked fine and the picture was awesome- I loved it. The Paranormal Activity 2 movie I ordered skipped several times throughout the movie despite it being brand new. There were also parts in the middle of the movie that looked to be of very poor quality for even a regular DVD(I ordered blu-ray). I would not recommend buying this product.
4,Christmas Gift,Granddaughter loves it. The material has an offense odor. We needed to put it outside for a time. It is getting better.
2,So many head injuries!,"I have an 18 month old, 3 year old and 4 year old. They love to bounce on this toy. We received it as a gift without the base. If it was stationary it would be great. As it is - no matter where I place the toy they bounce to a wall fall off and hit their head. They bounce toward a table, fall off and hit their head. They fall off over the head and land on their head. This toy spends a lot of time in ""time out"" for hurting people. I have finally convinced the kids it will be more fun to take the toy to Kid to Kid and exchange it for a safer toy. I hate taking a Nana gift away, but there is no amount of supervision that makes this toy injury proof."
2,Product Needs Improvement...,I'm very disappointed in this Rody Horse. The grandkids love it but it won't hold air. We have to pump it up every day to use it. Instructions not very good about how to close up air valve. I could keep air in a 99 beach ball better than this!
4,My kids really like it!,The great thing about this product is it can expand to fit your child. I didn't blow it up all the way for my younger daughter who is 15 months and it is blown up to the recommended maximum for my three-year-old.The downside is you have to use an air compressor to blow it up to a good size. If you use a foot pump it doesn't work well.They really enjoy bouncing up and down and also bouncing them so that they go around the room on them.I think it teaches them balance and coordination. I know that it is used for special needs children to teach them how to balance.I think it's a good product. I tend to put them away for a while and when I bring them out they are like a new toy and the kids get all excited again.See my picture in the images!
5,Rody rocks,Rody has held up well in our house. No holes after 7 years and despite some ear chewing. My nephew can catch plenty of air off of Rody. I am a big daddy and he has not popped when I sat on him. I do recommend that anyone buying Rody have strong front teeth as they are the only way I have been able to reliably remove the unconventional solid plastic air hole stopper.
1,ViaVoice Doesn't work with My OSX Lion operating system,"The IBM software ViaVoice will not work on my Mac with the lion operating system. After I received the software I found out that it was 12-year-old software. The box said it would work with the OS X software, I was not able to get it work because it uses an older unsupported Mac software program called Speak Pad. I had to return the product which was through a private vendor seller. The return process took longer because I had to send three e-mails to the seller explaining to him the problem (he said he didn't know anything about the software) and finally to give me the refund through Amazon. The seller authorized the refund but I will not buy private vendor software through Amazon this way again.Tom w"
1,a waste of time and money,I could not get the product to stay on. It would turn off before you finished sighting in. The on/off mechanism is really unreliable. When you could get it to work the beam was not really strong enough for any significant distance in daylight. My summary: It's just a waste of time and money. A box of bullets works much better and will work every time.
2,Dry as the desert,"I don't mean to say this is a bad book, but if you like history to be about the interaction of personalities and events, as I do, this book isn't for you. Reading it was a very long slog that finally picked up in the last 100 pages or so when we got to the post-WWII era. I read this book, which had been on my shelf for a long time, because I saw in the NY Times that Bin Laden and many other radical Arabs are obsessed by their history. Unfortunately, this book did not help me understand that history, and I learned more in the 3 hour PBS ""Islam"" special the other night than in a month of reading this.One other complaint: the book could have really used a glossary. There is an index of Arabic terms, but it is irritating to have to search through a page of text to try to glean a definition--that may or may not be buried in the referenced passage."
2,Very boring,I really was interested in the topic of Arab history but found the writing so boring I had a hard time staying awake. I finally gave up. I would look for another book on this subject.
1,Extremely detailed with major historical gaps,"What a tedious read!!! Where is the history of Suleyman The Great?! Did the crusades happen?! Did America ever do anything in Tripoli?! Do women exist in the modern Muslim world?!!!While being extremely detailed about historical social practices and religious thought, Hourani left out key historical periods.If you want to come to better understanding of Arab society, I am sure that you can find a more concise book that does not neglect / ignore key world events."
4,Excellent overview,"If you are looking to understand the basic outline of Arabic Muslim history and cultural development, this is the book for you. Hourani begins his history with the birth of Mohammed and brings up to the near-present. Filled with excellent map, photographs, and illustrations, lucid and concise writing, and astute analyses this book serves as a great introduction to Arabic Muslim history."
3,"Reminded Me A Bit Of Heritage, Civilization And The Jews...But Only A Bit","It took me about four years of starts and stops to finish this book, and I have a reputation for being able to read anything. Even with my ""Attention Surplus Disorder"" I found this dry material. Still, dry is not always a put-down, and I recognize that this study of the Arab peoples with concentration placed on the time of Muhammad forward, does deliver as promised the nearly complete history of the Arab culture. I came away more familiar with Arab self-identity than I had been when I began the project, and that was the goal. Whether one loathes Arabs or regards them with fascination, it must be admitted that their contributions earn them a place among the top civilizations on this planet."
2,Not much history here,"Hourani provides a great deal of cultural, societal, and economic information; but does not present a time and event based history. The author suggests that his history provides knowledge from the ""insider's"" point of view. That may be true; but the view is accompanied with a sense of vertigo - something is not quite right. This is not a useful book for those seeking information about historical events. I recommend Sir John Glubb's ""A Short History of the Arab Peoples""."
3,A partially missed opportunity?,"I agree with the criticisms made by some reviewers that this book can be a tedious read in places, but it is ultimately rewarding. The early history of Islam is well handled, though on occasion, particularly when dealing with the various schisms, the book becomes frustratingly unclear. The author is also occasionally side-tracked into discussions of the minutiae of rural life and trade, at the expense of perhaps more generally interesting and relevant questions, such as the relations between Arabs and Europeans, and foreign relations more generally. Overall, it is, I think, still the best of the scholarly books on this topic, but I do agree that it does, on occasion, read like worked-up research notes lacking a narrative structure to engage the reader."
2,History without lessons?,"I picked this up hoping to learn something about the people and culture(s) so frequently in the news for the past few years. Another reviewer notes that the first portion of the book is more of a history of Islam - I agree, but came away with not-so-new notion that the Arab culture is heavily intertwined with Islam. That said, I invested a lot of time reading this work, but really didn't feel that I was any smarter about the subject than I was 600+ pages earlier."
4,Good book for acquiring a background of the Middle East,"Hourani provides an excellent background of the history, culture and society of the Arab peoples. He succesfully combines these to provide the reader with a formidable picture of the life of of the peoples of the Middle Eastern and Maghrib Region during various periods in history, giving an excellent synopsis of how their history led up to the current events and problems of the region. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in studying this region, its people and its culture, as well as Islam more closely, as well as for those who are interested in understanding present day Arabia better"
2,Dense,"I was loaned this book by a professor of Middle East studies at the university I went too. I wanted to learn about the Middle East, and was told this book was quite good, comprehensive and fairly unbiased. This it was, and extremely boring too. I've read about 30+ books on Middle East history written by various authors, and this was probably the most boring of all of them. The book is quite long; the text is quite dense, and the level of difficulty is not appropriate for anyone who has not gotten a high school diploma. But the book is quite comprehensive, and covers the Arabs both before and after Mohammed. For those who want to learn about Arabia and Arabians, and how they lived before Islam, and how Islam changed them, this is the book to read."
4,Great reader!,"With 'A History of the Arab Peoples', Hourani gives a great introduction to those who want to learn more about the history of this region as well as the roots of its problems. I have always been mysified by the Arab peninsula and was not dissappointed when I picked up this book to learn more about it. Also, Hourani's account of poetry is very enlightening"
1,Not what I thougt it was...,"This is the story of Corbett Mack, a ""Stolen Child"" (half blood) of the Northern Paiute of the late 1800's. It tells the story in his own words of what it was like to be unaccepted in the white world nor the Indian world. The plight of the Notrhern Paiute after the arrival of the whiteman. He became an alcohol and opiate addict, and lead a tragic life that was somewhat typical of Native Americans during that time.Judging the book by it's title I had hoped it was about the life of the Northern Paiute prior to white man's arrival. A good book for this purpose is ""Indians of The Plateau and Great Basin"" by Victoria Sherrow."
4,Great and easy read.,"This is a great tool for those wanting additional information about the design of organizations. However, it is similar to The leadership experience by Daft."
2,Not for the casual builder,"soldered it up ok, main board was easy. but it was a challenge closing the small board with the RF parts. Got it working but thought it would be a little more versatile. Wished it came with a power supply or battery pack holder."
4,good moist cake,I love Entemanns products overall. I am pleased they have gone to offering single serving buy options. It allows for me to try products without purchasing a huge portion before knowing if I will enjoy.This pound cake mini is moist (which I figured some would be lost in mini size) and tasty. The cost is fair for the slices are pretty large serving.These are great for single serving deserts or for company as they are not cut pieces and present a little more finished and clean looking. Kids won't bicker over who got larger sliced piece and that is always a plus.Recommend.Christine
5,SUPER TRIO,"WHEN YOU LOOK BACK THIS WAS THE START OF WHAT WE HAVE TODAY AS THE COMBO OF SUPER TALENTS ALL ON ONE CD. WITH ALBERT COLLINS AND JOHNNY COPELAND AND A YOUNG ROBERT CRAY PLAY WITH GRIT AND THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE A REAL GOOD TIME ON THIS CD. BEST CUTS OR MY FAVOURITES ARE ""BLACKJACK"" AND T BONE SHUFFLE AND THE MOON IS FULL."
5,Show down,"Had any of you had the chance to listen to Robert Cray in person in the ""80's""....well, we would all be living in a better place. I know I am. His music has been the most pleasureable music for almost 20 years. When I left Tacoma Washington I made sure I had him with me. I remember the Back-40 in Tacoma LIVE MUSIC, always the best but these cds bring back lots of memories. Thank You Robert and here's to TACOMA Cathy Benson or better known as Steve Graeff's old lady Back-40 1980's"
5,Pure Stratcats and Telecats,"I cut out and kept a magazine review of Showdown! for about 6 years before I finally picked it up. To (loosely) quote the reviewer, ""Whoever got these three guys together in the same studio, at the same time, deserves a goddam medal.""Right on."
5,Le Parfum by Sonia Rykeil found better buy at,"Sonia Rykeil Le Parfum, I simply Adore this perfume, its the perfect smell for Autumn, a very special perfume, but I did find a better buy at thefragrancefactory.com"
1,Bad design - Wristband will break,I have owned this Nike watch for 7 months. Don't waste your money. The black bubber wrist band had separated from the body at the rear battery cover. The entire rubber/plastic hinge had cracked. This wrist band is not replaceable. A sports watch should be made rugged. This one is not. Lesson learned is to buy a watch which has a standard replacable wrist band.
5,The Proof,"When this album was released in 1980, I had the proof I needed to show all my friends that Eric was still an important player in the game. They all had written him off as a laid back psuedo country artist with no direction. At the time they didn't get it, and maybe they still don't. But one thing was for sure: Clapton still had the goods, and this album proved it. The blues playing on here had fire. The vocals had pain. As a guitar player, I wore out my vinyl copy trying to cop these licks. The cuts were smokin'. My friends finally heard what I had been talking about for several years. It was only with the release of Crossroads 2 that the secret really came out: Clapton never lost it. He just chose not to show it as much, but when he did as this album proved, LOOK OUT!"
3,Brits Play Americana? I Think Not...,"I have never heard any British band, save for the Rolling Stones, play American roots music authentically. This is no exception. The sound is cold, disjointed, and often uninspired. Albert Lee, Henry Spinetti, and co just can't hit the groove to carry songs like ""Tulsa Time"" convincingly. Sorry.As a contrast, compare ""Tulsa Time"" to the cut on ""Backless"". The studio sounds more organic, more live sounding than this one!Why?The musicians were from TULSA, OKLAHOMA. These guys grew up hearing a melting pot of country, blues, bluegrass, gospel...all American forms of music, mind you...on their radios. This band, clearly, didn't.I don't mean to sound overly snobby, but the truth is the truth. Brits, stick to more experimental, envelope pressing music. Let the Americans handle roots music."
5,Just one Night,"Great CD, Clapton is at his best. I enjoyed it, I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes Eric Clapton."
4,live clapton,"This album has always been a favorite of mine.Some may call it a blues album,and to an extent it is, but this is rock and roll at its best. I feel that it captures Clapton at a high point of his solo career.One could justify getting this just for song Double Trouble, which gets a blistering work out, better than studio version on No Reason to cry. While most songs are bluesy type country flavored work outs, there are a few well known Clapton songs ""Wonderful Tonite"" , Lay down Sally"",""Cocaine"", it is the guitar solos on the older standards that make this one of Clapton's most satisfying album. If you dont want to get the entire ""Live Crossroads"" box set, this lp is a good slice of his 70s live work."
5,Loved IT!,If you want something fresh listen to this CD. The music is up lifting and something you can listen to with a cup of coffee or on you way home from work. I first heard this on Pandora and had to have it only finding it at a good by from Amazon. Thanks
2,Where is the book of Jean Price Mars,"I think a biography of Dr Jean Price Mars is great! The sensible thing to do is to have to book itself ...Where is "" So spoke the uncle"""
3,Not the one shown on the picture,"I was expecting a fuel pump like the one shown on the picture, which is exactly the same as the one I'm replacing. To my surprise, the pump that came was a different model (although the same part no. SP140), that looks a lot cheaper. I haven't installed it yet, but it should still fit, since amazon was giving the OK for compatibility with my car, otherwise I will be really upset."
5,Excellent CD,My daughter plays violin and we absolutely loved this CD. Ordered it after hearing one of the pieces on XM Classics and had to purchase the CD.Jennifer Higdon is amazing!
4,The Other Other Side of the Hill,"This book gives the Russian history of the battle for the Caucasus in 1942-1943.(The German history is given in The Caucasus and the Oil.) This battle, occuring at the same time as the Battle of Stalingrad,was the turning point of World War II-Germany could not win the war after this. This book is a rather dry account of the struggle. If you are very interested in these events, this book is a must have. If not, skip this title."
1,Disappointing,"This book was really, really, disappointing. There wasn't much to it at all, and certainly nothing new. After reading it I had to wonder why it was presented as ""Aradia as you've never seen it before!"" When that is said, isn't it supposed to mean that the reader will receive something new and enlightening? I really hate the ""bait and switch"" game.Mostly the author offered small tid bits, in a 101 style, about general Greek and Roman myths that were sort of related to the material. But it doesn't seem like the author had much to really say on his own. So basically, it's really just a reprint of Leland's widely available book with some common bits and pieces tossed in. Nothing here for the collector of Leland's work (unless you don't already have a copy of his Aradia) and nothing here of interest for the folklorist or reader interested in Italian Witchcraft."
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered this book as part of the required reading in a course of study I am doing on Wicca. I have not finished it, though it is a short book, mainly because I find it a depressing attitude toward Wicca. The ancients commanded and threatened their dieties to get what they wanted. Maybe I am reading into it more or less than it is and I plan to go back and re-read it during the course of study to see if my attitude changes. I would not have purchased it if not for the required reading."
5,CampingGeek,"Stowaway camp table - good product easy to set up, easy clean up, use for grilling, room to lay out food for preparation"
4,"Stable, quality tabel, but a little fiddly to set up","Title says it all. It will take you some time to figure out the set-up process, but once set up this table is stable and seems well-made. I have used it several times now and it is still going strong. The only thing I don't like is that the top is multiple pieces held together with elastic which makes it a bit hard to move around, but this can be accomplished by grabbing the legs of the table, not the top."
3,Funnier in Idea than Execution,"Maybe it's a British humor thing. I liked ""The Liar"" well enough (good energy), although was disappointed by ""The Hippopotamus"". As an actor, Frye is great.I love Stephen Frye. My wife loves poetry. As ""The Ode Less Travelled"" was touted and sales seemed to confirm its universal appeal, I bought it as a gift for my wife. She tried it, and it wound up sitting on her nightstand for months while other books jumped ahead of it in importance. Eventually, during spring cleaning, it found itself on a bookshelf where it will probably never be cracked again.I tried it, and understood how it found itself there. Two years from now, plan on finding gift copies at used bookstores and library book sales. In the end, it seems like a book poetry lovers would not buy for themselves, but would be bought for them. Beware."
2,Standard Stuff,"An earnest enough effort but terribly dull. Fry wishes us to revisit schooldays and jot our way through Chaucer, Milton, Shakespeare, i.e. learn the basics, pay our dues. And while it may be true that much poetry, eg Bukowski, is mere chopped-up prose, notes and shopping lists, Fry is unwilling or unable to grapple with grandmaster Pound. There should be more on modernist poetry: TSE and Pound. The Waste Land receives scant coverage. Fry is a fuddy-duddy, amusing from a distance and a bore at close quarters. I wish he would let his hair down and give us some edge and spike."
4,Reverse your averse to verse,"Even if you don't want to write poetry, this book is a good way to battle your aversion to poetry. If you have an aversion, that is. Fry makes the point that nobody advises children to try playing the piano just by ""expressing themselves"", but that's how ""poetry"" is generally taught.The Ode Less Traveled is also a good introduction to Fry's work, which spans both genre and media.With his writing, his podcasts,his films and TV,Stephen Fry is becoming ubiquitous.In America, here,we are happy to seehimself and his film crew come spik wit' us."
1,Hans Christian Andersen,I love Danny Kaye and asked my grand daughter to watch this movie with me on TCM. She is 10 but still she enjoyed this movie so much all she could do was talk about it the next day. I thought it would make a good birthday gift for her. This dvd was cracked when I recieved it. Fortunatly I was able to use it! Maybe this seller should look their merchandise over before they ship.
5,One of my all time favorites,"I personally think this is one of Danny Kaye's best films, even though it's certainly not his most famous or popular. There are so many classic songs in here (Inchworm/2 and 2 are 4; Ugly Duckling; etc.) and Danny Kaye is a charmer here, much better than his more slapstick style in other movies.The only part that I found somewhat tedious was the long scene where he's trapped in a storage room at the ballet and can only imagine what the dancing must be like based on the music he hears (I admit I sometimes fast forward past this bit). But otherwise it's a 5-star-plus movie for me!"
5,Great for all ages,"This film is a delight, wonderful to be enjoyed by kids from 3-4 years and older by themselves or with parents or grandparents. A true classic."
5,"""Hans Christian Anderson""","This is a charming fifties musical film with Danny Kaye at his best. The songs are appealing, and the story equally enjoyable for children and adults."
5,Wonderful and beautiful story,"This was sent to me from I don't know who, but I've always loved the stories of Hans Christian Andersen, as well as Danny Kaye being a favorite performer.Hans Christian Andersen is a Dutch cobbler who enjoys telling stories to the children in his village. When concerns for the children's education begins to anger the adults, Hans and his apprentice Peter leave for Coppenhagen for new territory. In Coppenhagen, Hans finds inspiration for some of his most memorable stories, as well as love for a beautiful ballerina.Danny Kaye is endearing and charming as he works with the children he tells the stories to.The music is beautiful and charming and the ballet scene is fantastic.I heartily recommend this movie to fans of musicals, fairytales or ballet."
3,Danny Kaye never disappoints,"For all the film's deficiencies, Danny Kaye, always an outstanding performer, manages to be engaging and quite delightful.The plot has little to do with Hans Christian Andersen, and is based quite loosely on some of his tales, not his far from whismsical life. Only the happiest parts of Andersen's least troubling stories are included (in musical adaptation) - there is no hint of the writer of the Little Match Girl or the Red Shoes. This is strictly a vehicle for a warm, kind-hearted, naive Danny Kaye portrayal.It is good entertainment, if taken as a Kaye act rather than for literary or artistic merit."
4,A nice blu ray upgrade without any real extras,"This review is more for the blu ray release than for the film itself. The movie is superb on many levels.As for the blu ray release, it offers a slight upgrade over the dvd. It's not a crisp HD transfer as some other films offer although you can notice a slight improvement in the colors. The sound is average.There are no extras or ""making of"" features other than the theatrical trailer. The blu ray case is a short booklet of pictures and brief articles on the film.With that said, the original dvd had been hard to come by for years and so this blu ray is a welcome release. I would recommend purchasing it over the dvd for the slight upgrade in quality but don't expect an amazingly crisp HD picture. It might be worth waiting for it to drop below $20 for a better deal."
5,Great,I used to watch this movie when I was younger and have been looking for it for years. Thank goodness for Amazon.com. It was as good as I had remembered it! The colors and the story have a whole new meaning now.
3,A good kid's movie,"HAns Christian andersen is a good movie. Andersen (Danny Kaye) is a cobbler who can't stop telling stories for the little kiddies. This gets him in trouble with the top bananas in town, who vote to have him run out for making kids miss school. Andersen moves to Copenhagen, falls in love with a beautiful french ballerina, and gets himself famous for his stories, all the while going from song to song with true Kaye spirit. It was a good movie, but not one to be overly thrilled about."
1,Unexpected quality,This particular DVD did not work in my player. All other DVDs do work so this one must be defective or of far inferior quality!!!I have been very very satisfied with all other purchases from Amazon!
3,Hans Christian Andersen -Denmark,"The DVD received can not be played on the Danish systems - guess that standards are different. But as it was meant as a present for our American relatives we hope it will work over there. Otherwise - well, we just lost our money, and so what?"
5,much better than the more recent item of this name,"this is a feel good movie for the whole family. The songs are fun and catchy (I think my favourite would be ""the emporah's new clothes""), and danny kaye and his young co star are a joy.the dvd copy I have is in excellent condition - sure it mighta been nice to have some extras, but that is fine and it certainly does not detract the fact that this is a classic.This movie was reportedly years in the making, and apparently when danny kaye travelled to Denmark, after it came out, he was greeted with quite a postive reception."
5,Great Kids Movie!,I have enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid so I had to get it for my grandchildren. They love it too. The movie arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.
5,Danny Kaye,"One of Danny's best roles, he fits in so smoothly! You can almost see him as the person, he's just magical!"
5,Pure Joy,"Hans Christian Anderson wrote many of our most loved fairy tales, and this movie brings them to life with the incredible talent of Danny Kaye. you can see this with the whole family young and old alike, and i can guarantee you will be singing the songs for days afterward, including songs you already knew but did not realize came from this movie. This is a colourful joy to watch and just leaves you feeling good inside. I think Danny Kaye is great and mixed with some of my favorite tales and songs it is just PURE JOY."
3,The Magic of Danny Kaye,"The movie is supposed to be the story of Hans Christian Andersen, but it really is a showcase for the incredible talent of Danny Kaye. The songs are good, the color is crisp and it makes for marvelous family fare."
3,Not A Sonic Measuerer,"It's a pretty neat tool, the only problem is this is not actually a sonic measurer, which is the main reason I bought it. The batteries that came with it were all corroded as well.So far, besides the fact that I got bad, leaking batteries and that it doesn't actually do what Amazon says it does, it's good."
4,Excellent gadget,"I've just received this one, didn't actually do a real test (will do one very soon) but intially, the laser level, the auto leveling and the accuracy is quite impressive, compared to many returned ones. I just think it is quite big. I didn't really expect the real size. But still very usefull, and I have three of my freinds want to buy similar ones. they work in the Decor business."
4,Eats batteries,"This item works fatastic and the measuring options to evenly split a space are great. The only drawback is this thing eats batteries. I can put new batteries in, use it, turn it off and put it in the closet and two weeks later the batteries are dead."
2,It works... sort of,"I am amazed that this is about the only tool to do this job. If you want something better than pressed steel that only sort of works well it seems you are out of luck. You can get by with this tool but you will sometimes need something that gets a better grip or presents a better surface to hold onto. Keeping chainrings tight is important and you might think there was a better (bigger, stronger, better grip on ""nut"") tool available."
1,garbage in a box,"#1 doesn't work on Windows 7#2 totally amateurish, low quality graphics (I installed it on an old Windows OS inside VMWare)#3 not much here for kids to learn#4 my 5 year old got bored with it in 30 minutes; never used it againTotal waste of time."
3,"Nice program, just outdated",This is a really nice beginner program for my children (2-4). I wish I had looked for the updated version before purchasing this one though. There is a much better edition available in the form of an app that costs 75% less than this product.
3,for very young ones,"My kids enjoyed the games but they got dull after a while. Perhaps it is best for very small children, maybe toddler age."
4,Good computer game for kids,"We got it for my 3 yr old daughter and she enjoys it. She likes doing alphabet&phonics; part of it and also book reading.The cd is designed for xp but works fine for windows 7 so far. I recommend this for kids starting to learn alphabets, phonics and starting to read.The shipment was fast and arrived in good condition as described."
1,False advertising,This game won't work on any PC or MAC. I wish I would've read the reviews first. I want my money back!
5,Great product for my 5-year old!,"It started with the 30-day free trial that I downloaded for my 5-year old niece. I saw how much she loved this software. She would show me all her ""toys"" in her room, and all the games she was playing. After the 30 days ran out, I purchased a 30-day subscription. She's been using this for 3 months and she still loves it.It's not too entirely expensive either. I'd rather be paying a small price than having my niece bombarded with advertisement."
1,operating systems,sellers just states windows and mac o.s. but the product does not work with windows 7 or mac o.s. x so it was a double whammy for me would not work on my acer or mac
1,Horrible program!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM! This is by far the worst program I've ever seen. For starters, it isn't compatible with anything newer than windows XP. It will run on the mac, but only certain parts of the program, like ""printable activities"". The only plus about it is that I didn't lose to much money. DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM!"
1,software won't work as advertised,I bought this software and it won't load to my computer even after I follow instructions on the cd and on their website. my kid was disappointed as he is used to software working right from the box. this is a waste of money.
4,"A little corney, but great",liked..corney..but slow to introduce sight words which I see as a very good thing. Using with my advanced 2 year old!
5,Great addition to my home practice!,"This DVD is exactly what I needed for my home practice! I love YJ's livemag practices on their website, but it's really annoying to have to find and load individual videos on your laptop whenever you want to watch them! (Plus, I never like doing yoga to my laptop screen....it kind of ruins it for me). These sequences are some of the best I've used, mostly because the DVD gives you so many options depending on your goals.FYI, even though the cover says there are 9 practices, it's because one of the sequences (Heart Wide Open) has 2 different parts. I love this option because the two parts really build on one another, but I can do them individually if I don't have the extra time!I highly recommend this DVD for anyone in need of a good guide for their individual practice."
3,"It does what it's supposed to do, dry your hair.","This dryer does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is to dry your hair. It does dry the sides of the hair as well. However, this dryer is LOUD! My daughter was drying her hair, and I honestly thought I'd be deaf after she finished using it. However, it is not as loud if you are the person under it. That's the only bad report for this dryer. Otherwise it works pretty well. And it folds down really nicely, and could even be tucked up under your bed!"
5,Neat Hair Dryer,"I have natural wavy fine hair. No matter what I do, the hairdo doesn't last more than a day. I tried blow drying with a diffuser, which does OK. Most of the time I air dry my hair. I bought this dryer so I can wash my hair more often and forego the air drying. It takes about 15 minutes under this dryer rather than an hour ofair drying, and haphazard results with the diffuser."
2,Collapsablitiy wonderful! Dryability not so wonderful!,"I absolutely love the design of this dryer. I ordered it because I have to use a dryer like this for my hair (I use very big rollers due to very curly hair...it straightens and smooths without frying it) and when I travel, I have to lug it with me. This one would fit in a suitcase. HOWEVER, the vents are only in the top of the dryer, so it feels like it is burning the top of your head, but doesn't dry the sides and bottom portion of hair. Also, this dryer is sooooo loud! I have older bonnet style models that are much quieter. Wish someone would design a hard hat bonnet style dryer that collapses but drys the entire head, not just the top! Just didn't work for me...I had to send it back :("
4,Hair dryer,"I prefer a bonnet hair dryer, so this product is great. It works fine and I like the way it folds up. I am not crazy about the cord storage area. I can never get the whole cord inside and it takes to long to accomplish the amount I do get inside."
3,Used until its end,"I bought this dryer about 1 1/2 years ago. It has now died because the bonnet is falling apart piece by piece. The adjustable part is also the locking mechanism when you close it. That is the part that is falling apart. As someone said in another review, it mostly heats at the top, but overall, for what you spend, its what you get. One and a half years."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I decided to purchase the Conair HH400 due to the price, and lack of other options, as a replacement for a hair dryer that I have had for years. Aside from the hood being too short, the dryer being too loud and the limited heat settings (high and low),this dryer has been overheating and the plug is almost completely melted. Since I used a different dryer with the same wattage for years without a problem, I have to believe that the dryer is the issue. I purchased this dryer in July 2012 and now, three months later, I have to purchase a new dryer. Apparently, I only had a month to return this dryer to Amazon, according to their return policy for this item. I DO NOT recommend this item."
3,ended up on the garage sale,"This is good if you have short hair and you don't have to hold a dryer.But I have long hair and after few uses came the disappointment. It's not that good for long hair and it uses too much space.If you have short hair, have storage space and don't want to have to hold a dryer it may be a product you'll like. It's a little noisy also but this was not an issue for me.End of story I sold on the garage sale."
3,Decent,Decided to but this dryer after my other dryer finally said it had enough. I like the fact that it is collapsable because it fits over the bed and out the way but i don't like that the vent holes are only on top. You will have to move your head around to get the sides and back. With this dryer it took about 2 hour for my apl natural 4a hair to dry. Guess you can't beat it for the price.
3,Good Dryers,This dryer came fairly quickly it wasnt what I expected but it works ok. It does what it needs to do.
2,not what I expected,"I was disappointed when I received the dryer because the bonnet is not very deep. Only the top portion of my head fit underneath so the majority of my hair would not get dry if I were to use this dryer. If my hair was shorter this would be okay but since I wrap my hair before drying, this dryer was not practical for me. I did not use it so I do not know how well it heats."
3,Not a top of the line dryer but gets the job done,Order arrived on time. Dryer is somewhat flimsy so be careful in retracting hood and setting up height. It seems as if it could easily break. Hood is not too deep so top of my head was overdried while ends were still damp. For the price it is a decent dryer-just be prepared for uneveness of drying on head of hair.
2,SHould Have Taken The Advice of Others,"Absolutely horrible design. Like other reviewers have said, the dryer only dries the top of your hair, which makes the drying process exceedingly long and tedious. I wish I could send this back, I absolutely hate it and cannot believe that it is 1875 watts, since the drying process is so slow and inefficient.A waste of money, save your money and buy another hood hair dryer."
3,I agree..it dries the top third of your head,"For the price, it does a good job if you are willing to move your head around to get the back of your hair dry. I have fine hair, and bend my neck to reach the back and then move my head side to side. If you don't mind doing stretching exercises while drying, it works.!"
5,Very Happy With Hair Dryer,I have used the dryer for about one month. I love it.Its compact easy to store. The dryer is powerful.And its not too noisy. Just what I was looking for.I recommend it.
3,missionary,It's o.k. I wish I had gotten one of the other bonnet dryers. I don't like that the little air vents are just right at the top of the dryer. It's o.k. if you wear your hair very short because most of the heat blow right on top of your head. I'm use to a lot better hair dryers for about the same price. It will do though. Put it like this-it does well enough to keep me from having to send it back.
2,too hot,"When set for ""hot"" the cord gets very hot and am afraid it will start an electrical fire. Will use for five to ten minutes, let it cool off then start again."
3,not working,I plugged it in and it wont come on at all. Not working and I really wanted this type of dryer
5,so awesome,"this hair dryer is great. I had an old hooded type and it was lost in a fire. I ordered this one after reaading alot of reviews. Couldn't be happier. Not that noisy, heats quickly, the size of the hood is big. I would recemond this hair dryer to any one that wants a compact, good hair dryer.."
3,"Okay, but better for short hair or people using curlers","I bought this for my naturally curly hair as a way to beat my curly hair frizz. While it does the top of my head nicely, the bottom half stays wet, even after 45 minutes. I have shoulder length hair, so it is not super-long. Kind of disapppinting. I will opt for a better shape next time.I imagine this is a great drier for someone using curlers, though"
2,disappointed customer,I use very large rollers and this bonnet was way too small! Also the settings will not allow me to condition my hair. I was very disappointed.
4,Love my Hair Dryer,I needed a hair dryer for those days when going to the hairdresser just isn't possible. Love it! It's conveniently compact and easy to assemble.
1,Don't buy this!,"I have owned Conair products before and thought I could trust in them. I was very wrong. I really hate this dryer! When you try to extend it to be higher, it tends to collapse. But the worst is the fact that the actual drying area is so shallow that I can't even dry the bottom of my hair; if you use large curlers for long hair, you simply can't get them all into the bonnet. In addition, the space to store the cord is tiny and you have to crush the cord into it. It is a waste of money."
4,hairdryer,"the hair dryer was exactly what i expected, it was a great size and puts out alot of heat. it shipped fast and it was a reasonable price"
2,"Wet, at the bottom, dry at the top - This dryer is definitely a flop!","Dryer had to be returned because the hood is too small to go over the head when you have rollers in. Which is basically the point of this type of dryer. At least for me it was. The bottom of your hair will remain wet.If you have long hair or just enjoy using larger rollers for a fuller look, please select another dryer."
1,Conair Hair Dryer,I was very disappointed once I received the item. Some of the reviews gave it high marks which I cannot understand. It is poorly constructed and the air vents only cover the top half of your head. I used it once and it was hurting my hearing so I couldn't finish using it. It truly sounds like a small propelled airplane is right next to you.
2,I could not believe it,"When I received the hair dryer, the part that you flip underneath was broken!! I knew that it could not have been my fault because as soon as I took it out of the box, a plastic piece fell and I saw the damage. I think that I wasted my money on this product and I could have bought something better. I also agree with review number one, it does not have enough hair hole to dry the front or ""edges"" of my head. Overall this is a satisfactory product but I would not recommend this to everyone."
3,"Works, but extremely loud","This hair dryer does what I need it to do, but I think the loud sound it makes when running is damaging to my hearing. The first time I used it, my ears were ringing for hours afterward. Product works, but highly recommend ear protection."
3,Gets the job done,This product works fine and the price is very good. Therefore it's a good value however I believe you get what you pay for. The other reviews about not drying the sides and back is right on target but I have thin hair which means my hair dries fast. Also I supplement drying with hair dryer. Not ideal but gets the job done.
1,"I hate it, my 4 year old is indifferent","This book is written oddly. There is a story, but each illustration has the characters saying something in cartoon format that you have to read to get the lesson. I find this comic book style very irritating. I also don't think ""Annie,"" the little girl in the story, learns any lesson from disobeying. The book does not clearly show consequences, and just seems pretty abstract in general. My 4 year old doesn't mind reading it, but I don't like it and it hasn't helped him figure out how to obey at all, so it was kind of a bust."
3,Keys small and hard to see letters,Not bad but the keys are small and it is hard to see letters. Those improvements would make it much better.
1,So much detail in the listing but no attention to detail in the design of this radio,"Very disappointed in this radio. Perhaps in a city radio reception might be better but my first transistor radio (40 years ago) did better than this. I had to keep fiddling with the antenna to get Maine Public Radio to come in. Perhaps you have an extra kid to assign to antenna duty, but mine have grown up. The siren switch looks just like the radio on/off switch, so watch what you're doing or you'll get blasted. I've yet to get close to 40 minutes using the crank charge. Perhaps that is due to being further from the city as well. The product description was right on the nail about the shortwave reception though, with ""Shortwave reception inconsistent""What a waste of $60."
4,Almost perfect,"As an emergency radio, I find it important to have multiple power sources. This one works great. Also the ability to charge a cell phone is great. You do have to tell the company which phone you have and they'll send you the appropriate adapter. On the downside, with a 4.5 volt output, why not provide a USB charging cable? The freq display isn't lit with the light. There is no weather band.Pros - Power sources, cell phone charging, signal strengthCons - no weather band, freq display not lit"
3,my praise,"ive read this series since the start, and ive always love it, reading the whole series about three times but since i got last order im going into my fourth cycle. but im disappointed. not in the book but having to wait for the next volume T_T...."
4,"New, different, and not quite Angel of Redemption","The older Battle Angel series is what got me started on Manga and undoubtably it will end it. The art was fantastic, the story incredible and the various nods to actual scientific reasearch were all refreshing. Most of all, the characters were undeniably interesting. Especially Alita.And that is why I picked up Last Order. As a veteran, I have to say that Alita is back! This story does all the justice of the first series and adds quite a bit to it.But it is getting a 4 instead of a five because not only is the book printed in the rather difficult to get used to Magna form(its backwards folks) but I also felt these books focused just a little too much on the violence rather than the story. In the first series, teh violence was built into the story. Here, it seems the story is...you guessed it! Built into the violence. Not entirely a bad thing, just a little less fun overall."
4,Very faded colors on cover,"This is definitely a collectors item, but is it worth collecting? If you want Alita to last forever (which I do), then sort of. The print quality is great, like the paperbacks, but without the covers being uniform, it's almost pointless to collect them.To clarify this, I just want to let everyone know this is not about the story, art, etc, just the binding/printing.The book is the same size as the trade paperbacks are. It is in hardcover, but the pages were trimmed without the actual art being trimmed; which means some of the art gets cut off at the edges. The artwork/words also seem to sink into the middle of the book's spine (the bleed) if they get to close.The print quality is fine, and the logos and identifying marks are all here, but the cover image is unforgivably poor. The colors are so dull, there are white specks in Alita's hair, and the image is not nearly as sharp as it should be."
5,The Renewal of our Minds,"I have no original thoughts to share that are not already addressed in the above reviews concerning the text itself. As they say, it is an excellent resource for spiritual and intellectual nourishment in an arid climate of flabby philosophy and sold out (bankrupt) and accommodating theology. I only want to reiterate what this book sets out to accomplish, namely that Christians are in the midst of an important opportunity to redeem the time, to remind the culture at large through our intellectual and lived witness that ideas matter, and that the driving principles of our time are not going to satisfy their deepest thirsts. Materialism, scientific and otherwise, and its children are at the root of this culture of decay and despair and the Gospel is as relevant now as it was when Christ was resurrected. May this culture pass and usher in the age to come through the renewing of our minds.And don't forget to subscribe to First Things and Touchstone! Enjoy!"
3,Lexus es 350 filter,I gained about 1-2 mpg with this filter. I also noticed improved acceleration. I knocked off one starbecause I had a problem with the fit. It took me 20 minutes to make the filter seat properly. Do not know why.
4,"Good replacement, a little more kick at lower rpm","I just need a better replacement than my thicker stock filter on my xb, I just notice a slight faster throttle in the lower rpm like it pulls quicker when going from 0-35mph, other than I just hope it last 30,000 miles before replacing again"
5,K&N is the only way to go.,"If you have never used a K&N filter, you should. It is all about airflow. Try breathing through a straw (regular paper filter), then breathe normally (K&N). You will notice the difference the first time you step on the gas. Also, it increased my MPG from around 19 in city, to around 22. Worth the money."
3,No gain in HP or MPG,"Does what it is supposed to do, which is let more air in. Unfortunately it also lets more dirt in, the proof is in the oil. I went back to using OEM air-filters and I noticed a return of low-end torque and increased gas mileage."
4,Save me $$,A noticeable performance improvement and save me money from having to buy a new air filter each time. Recommended!
3,K&N Air Filter for Toyota Avalon,"I purchased this for a 2007 Avalon Limited.This car is a daily driver for commuting ~200mi roundtrip.I've had great use out of K&N; filters for the past 15 years.However, my gas mileage has dropped about 2 miles per gallonsince installing this into the Avalon 3 weeks ago.All 8 tanks since replacement have had lower mpg than the previous 8tanks of gas."
5,Another Great Product from K&N!,Easy to install and I could tell a definite difference in the sound and performance of the engine. I always liked K&N products and the ease of installation combined with the performance makes this a great product. I have seen a slight increase in my mpg which is also a plus!
3,interesting series,The first season they just screw around and nothing is done. The second season is better but characterization varies from episode to episode. The story is pretty unique combining comic animation with live action. Special effects are pretty good. Another thing that bothers me is that there are necromancers but they don't do anything related to the field. Still the show is entertaining.
5,great quality,Got this for $6.50 and ordered XL. Was a little worried it would be too big but it runs slightly small so fit perfectly. Good quality fabric and the logo printing is outstanding.
3,for the new christian,"I don't know what it is about this book, I just didn't find it, as a new Christian, to be very helpful. I understand it is a classic and all, but it just seems there are better books out there. I'd recommend C.S. Lewis, John Piper, Yancey, MacArthur, and of course studying a good translation (like the NASB) of the BIble itself."
2,What gives?,"A thread of unconscious doubt runs through this book. Whence do we get ""intellectual suicide"" as a non-requirement to consider the deity of Jesus (pg 8)? What compels Stott to say he is not saying something, not saying ""...we should suspend rational thinking"" to discover God (pg 16)? Why does Stott raise the specter of doubt while exhorting treatment of the Gospels ""...as the historical documents they undoubtably are"" (pg 22)? Stott says Christians are ""...not a self-regarding coterie of smug and selfish prigs who are interested only in themselves"" (pg 140). They aren't?An honest treatment of Christianity is not found here."
4,A Good Introduction To a Life Devoted To Christ,"Basic Christianity was given to me by one of my two best friends when I first became a Christian. She said to me, ""It's not entertaining, but it has good information."" I think that she described Basic Christianity accurately.Basic Christianity definitely did give good information. It would be good for someone who is doubting their faith in Christ or someone who is not quite sure yet about Jesus. Mr. Scott discusses the meaning of the cross and all that Jesus went through. Also, as a new Christian, it was good for me because it gave some pointers on how to live a life devoted to Christ.I found fault with Basic Christianity only in that it was a bit of a chore to get through at times. It is very interesting at most points, but some parts of the book were fairly boring.Overall, I would recommend Basic Christianity to any teen or adult Christian."
5,Sound teaching,"Two things stand out to me about this book, neither of which is profound or new.First, John Stott has spent much time in ""grounding"" himself in the message of our Lord.

2,Not for the faint of heart Lots of graphic sex,"I really enjoyed the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld and have been trying to win this book for some time. I FINALLY received it last week. I have to tell you I was very much disappointed. This book had very graphic sex scenes that I did NOT enjoy. I did not get far into this book before abandoning it. I don't mind a little sex but this book was centered around it. I did not get far enough into the story line to figure out why the main character went to clubs every night. She not only had the ability to change her age, her gender, even giving herself noticeable deformities but she could also heal ailments in other people. This book sells for a very high price, which I really don't understand. It's just a basic paperback. Maybe because it's Scott Westerfelds' first book. Anyway, if you like a sex book this is the one for you. Enjoy."
4,Adorable,"The blanket colors are received are absolutely adorable. I was a little nervous about not getting to pick the colors, but they are awesome. I just love them!! Also, the quality is not bad for the price - they are a little thinner (but solid), and perfect for snuggling baby up in!"
4,Good product at a good price.,"The prints of this show were not preserved well, so no DVDs of them will look as good as buyers would hope, but the DVDs in this box set look as good as any I've seen. The package is appealing, too."
1,Public Domain material often sells for $1 per disc .,I cannot imagine why this 12 or 8 DVD set sells for so much money when the producer did not have to pay any distribution rights for the material now in the public domain. My only criticism is price and that it should be priced accordingly for what it is. Why if you did not read these reviews and based on the price you might expect to be receiving a beautifully mastered set from excellent pre-print materials.
4,Missing glider pilots and more,"To Mark Simon: The episode you are looking for is called Reunion. I also appreciated the strangeness factor of this story. I remember seeing it during the original run of the series. It's one of many One Step Beyond shows that have not been released to the public. Hopefully it's not forever lost.To all One Step Beyond fans: Check out John Kenneth Muir's book An Analytical Guide to Television's One Step Beyond, 1959-1961. More information than you probably want to know about the history of this fine TV series including a synopsis and analysis of many, if not all, episodes filmed including Reunion. There is a new edition scheduled for release on Halloween, October 31, 2006. For those of you who can't wait go to alibris.com where you might be able to pick up a used hardcover."
3,A little bit disappointing,"This product certainly has the largest selection of episodes than any other collection now available. The price was right. I paid only $8 for 50 episodes brand new. However, this collection does have its flaws. The video compression is obvious and not surprising considering that there are 13 episodes squeezed onto each disk. It would have been better, in my humble opinion, for the manufacturer to have used 8 disks for these 50 episodes. Also, the playback has problems with periodic picture freeze-up and the display of ""digital squares"" where the recording did not make a clean transfer to the disk surface. It is not a bad product for the money; however, if given a choice I would have chosen the other package with 33 epidsodes instead."
4,One Step Beyond: Well worth owning,"I was a young kid when this series debuted on A.B.C in 1959. I remember the nights when my father used to watch these shows and I huddled close to him because they scared me so much. There was an episode that I vaguely remember that I had nightmares about. It was the one with the twin sisters where one of them died in a house fire while the othertwin was found by her boyfriend in bed next to him with her body severely charred (anyone for spontanious human combustion?) Anyway I would like anyone to tell me what the name of this episode was. To go even one better, I have had one of those ""One Step Beyond"" things happen to me and believe me it was very scary to say the least! Since that event I am a true believer in the paranormal. The ""One Step Beyond"" series is wellworth owning despite the ""less than perfect"" video quality"""
1,Ain't that price a bit extreme...,"I hope there's a lot more episodes than what's listed.I picked up a box-set of 50 episodes of the very same ones in a bargin bin at Shopko for $5.00, in good quality too.Your asking $537.00. Good-luck.WOW!!! It's a cool series but, not that cool."
1,Lousy transfer/ Worn copies,"It's incredible that in february 2004 you get a DVD release that has the sound and video quality of an old betamax tape. The releasers used the most worn copies that they could found.They are filled of scratches and splices. They are dark, grainy and the sound quality is awful.This is a lack of respect to the consumer and to ""One Step Beyond""On my opinion, don't buy the complete set. Get one single and if you consider that the quality is enough, then get the rest.It's easier to dispose away one DVD than twelve.If what you want is to have the collection because of it's historical interest, then don't listen to me, but I'm complaining because actually I'm watching ""on air"" (on saturday nights) some copies that have full quality; but I'm unable to get them. So, there are still good copies from where the releasers can make a good quality DVD transfer."
4,Not Perfect but well worth it!,"Maybe someone can tell me why buying the individual volumes(all 12)is cheaper than buying the 12 DVD set which I did. The stories are excellent and based on true accounts. The DVD's do have imperfections in them but if you liked this series it is well worth the cheap price. I hope they release the rest of the series, all 98 episodes. At least this brings 49 episodes on all 12 volumes."
3,"beat up 16mm TV station copies, but....",...you DO get the show and it WAS great.LOTS of splices. Bits of missing dialogue. The films from which they made the transfer....in pretty bad shape. BUT...it's just like Saturday afternoon TV on that local station way-back-when.
4,Good but salty,"I have been using this product for 5+ years and have enjoyed it much. I sometimes will mix in chopped hot dogs or sausage for variety. Spicy sausage works well. The main complaint I have is the amount of salt they put in the mix. I can almost smell the salt! Unfortunately they do not have the reduced sodium version where I live so I will try to order it online. Overall, it's very flavorful but too salty. It's much more flavorful than the similar Goya product."
1,Defective on arrival,"The belt clip flew apart the first time I used it. I pressed the release button and pieces went flying. I found all the bits and tried to put it back together, but a piece of plastic that holds the large piece of spring steel was broken. The case itself fit perfectly, looks great, and I think it would've suited my needs. But, I need the belt clip. The return process is quite easy so far, so I'm quite happy with Amazon."
2,Worked good...for about 3 weeks,At first I really liked this case. It fit the phone well and was easy to work with. The belt clip worked well and I liked that you could rotate the phone on the clip.Then the ratcheting mechanism broke and the phone spun around freely. Shortly after that it would not lock into the belt clip at all. After it popped off my belt and fell in the dog's water dish I gave up on it. Nice product if you only plan to use it a couple of weeks. Otherwise don't bother.
2,A bit disappointed.,"I've used this case for about 2 weeks and I'm somewhat disappointed. The leather is a good sturdy quality but the stitching is beginning to unravel. Also, the swivel/click mechanism has become worn and the phone will not stay upright on my belt. It spins freely and has become annoying. All this after only two weeks has left me disappointed. I will not buy again."
4,Great skin,"Nice materials, great protection and function. Easy to use and handle. Sometimes makes dialing a problem, will add numbers becasue of taut sleeve over number pad...but truly a plus for cellphone protection!"
3,Nice fit,"Fits very good, not a big enough hole for the camera though. The clip works great but it's a bit bulky."
1,Not What It Should Be,Bought this case for my phone and can't even get it in to the case. Right case for the right phone. Waste of money. Don't buy.
1,I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE THIS BOOK!,"I love Most of Linda Girard's books, but this is the worst children's book I ever touched. It deserves a TURKEY instead of a star. It makes fun of children with AIDS. It says in this book that Alex got AIDS from a transfusion. It is no longer possible to get AIDS from blood transfusions because all donated blood is tested for HIV and AIDS. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. Insteas buy the CD ""For Our Children."""
2,Not much help for hobby application,"Most illustrations are from large operations, not much in there for a novice and small projects, very little detail steps.I have a little experience with fiberglassing and repair and hoped this would help me further, but need to find something with more detailed instruction and illustrations."
3,ok,its a book s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s ssssssssssssssssssssss s sssssssssssssssssssss ssssssssssss
1,"Makes me feel like a one year old, too wordy","This book covers a good basis of composite information, however, the author wrote it like a ""book for dummies"". Its too wordy. I find myself sifting through too much material to pick the nuggets and points to his chapters. I'm currently purchasing other books because this one lacks the ""meat and potatoes""."
2,"Not a biogaphy, a critique","I divide this book in two parts. An interesting view of Bach's life, quite different from the ""standard"", and a book review to complain of the other biographies. If he concentrated in his view on Bach's life it would be an interesting book. His comments about the other biographers belong in the end notes. They are not a part of the story of Bach. I read foot notes, mind you, but including them in the text only detracts from the flow of the story.His comments about the music per-se are very interesting. They served my purpose, in buying this book. But once again, if I bought the author's book it is because I would like to know what he thinks ... not why other musicologist are wrong in their evaluation. Mine might be wrong, and that is why I want other's opinion, not their opinion on other people."
5,One of the Greats!,"This is a fabulous movie. Corny? You bet! Fun? Absolutely. Although I don't believe in letting small children watch TV, every once in a while we will throw in a DVD for them when they are sick. This movie, along with Take Me Out To the Ball Game and Yankee Doodle Dandy, is the perfect film for youngsters 2 and older. It's heartwarming and funny. Marjorie Main is terrific; Judy and Gene are even better. The film has wonderful songs (especially ""I'm Glad I Met You""), exciting energy, and lots of laughs. Treat yourself. Treat your kids."
4,An American Classic,"This is one of my favorite musicals. Judy Garland and Gene Kelly light up the screen and with supporting characters as Marjorie Main, Eddie Bracken and Gloria DeHaven you couldn't ask for better. This musical may never have received the recognition it deserved, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Judy Garland's dance number of ""Get Happy"" is a classic. Definitely underrated."
3,Good but not a favorite.,Gene Kelly and Judy Garland are great individually but in this movie there is no chemistry. A dull script pulls the movie down.
4,Summer Stock,This movie always makes me smile. Its an upbeat movie that makes you want to sing and dance every time you watch it.
4,Summer Stock,"One of the last Judy Garland musicals. She is wonderful, as is the rest of the cast. They don't make them like that anymore. Musicals that you can actually understand the lyrics and hear them without the music drowning them out. Also the price and quality was very good."
5,Absolutely wonderful.,"I think that this film has some great songs, especially the Judy solo, Get Happy. I think that Gene Kelly does his best also, with Gloria DeHaven doing well. However, the star has to be Judy as she is the all time greatest entertainer."
3,Get Happy With Summer Stock,"Judy Garland at the end of her career at M.G.M. is erratic, but wonderful. It is also the least of the screenplays with which she had to work. Phil Silvers is over-baked and Gene Kelly has some wonderful numbers. All in all the film is a mixed bag of highlights and not so highlights."
4,A Pleasant Musical,"This great movie centres around Jane Falbury (Judy Garland) and what happens when she allows her sister Abigail (Gloria De Haven) and her theatre troupe to use her barn to stage a musical.Although initially hating the idea, it soon becomes apparent that Jane has 'greasepaint in her veins' when Abigail drops out and Jane has to perform in the lead role.Along the way she falls for the handsome director (Gene Kelly) and decides that an acting career is what she longs for in life.This was Judy's last MGM picture. She was fired from the studio after her work in the musical ANNIE GET YOUR GUN was deemed terrible and she was replaced by Betty Hutton in the role. Later she would make her great comeback as Esther Blodgett in the musical version of A STAR IS BORN."
4,Good Dumb Fun,"The plot is paper-thin, but the numbers are charming and extremely fun. Gene Kelly's newspaper dance shows, once again, just how innovative, inventive, and downright TALENTED he was. And there's no forgetting Judy's knockout Get Happy finale, which is simply one of her best. It's also very sweet that they couple Every Sunday, a one-reeler and Judy's first film under contract at MGM, with her very last Metro outing."
3,one of my favorite Judy Garland/Gene Kelly movies!,"This movie is light and happy. The plot is not very deep, but the dance scenes and songs are charming."
3,"Engaging, spirited Garland-Kelly musical!","Judy plays a farm girl who must put up a theatrical troupe headed by Gene Kelly in her barn. Easily dismissible plot, bolstered by Kelly and Garland's dynamic, musical showmanship. Eddie Bracken and Marjorie Main add to the comedy. Phil Silvers is a tad over-bearing and Gloria De Haven is in a thankless role. Hi-point: Judy's smashing ""Get Happy"". Low point Kelly-Silver's dreadful duet, ""Heavenly Music"", which Judy had the good sense to bow out of. Still, for all the supposed lightness and levity, Judy's on-screen tenseness and stridency is distracting to the proceedings and portends her imminent MGM exit."
5,Hauntingly close to home,"Mr. Woodall has captured in verse some of the most gut wrenching thoughts and emotions that almost every infantryman in vietnam endured. This is a good book for someone who finds it difficult to understand a friend or relative who is a combat vietnam veteran. It is almost too close to home for the vet himself. Another ""grunt"" !"
5,Loved it!,I loved this book! I had no idea about Mozarts personal life. It was amazing how women coped back then with the loss of so many children. It's also interesting how much infidelity she put up with & everyone acted like it was no big deal.
2,Mozart's Wife,This book really didn't keep me interested and I didn't finish reading it. It started out very slowly and depicted Mozart in a very negative way.
3,historical romance with real characters,"I don't usually read romance novels, so I don't know how this book would compare to other works in this genre. But it did keep me entertained to the end. Obviously, this book is fiction, and the smutty parts would probably have embarrassed these characters, so it's best to keep low expectations about the historical accuracy of any event within its pages."
2,Poorly written fairytale,"The author would do well to take an English grammar class as well as hire an editor prior to attempting any more nonsense like this book. She consistently misuses and abuses the English language. Using""confident"" as ""confidante"" is a typical example. She also frequently uses the possessive ""'s"" when she means to use the plural form of a word.The book jumps back and forth in time and is very disjointed.Instead of a historical novel, this is nothing more than a tale of romantic interludes. The main character comes across as a whining witch concerned about money (or rather the lack of)and her next sexual encounter. If you want to know more about Mozart's ""magic fingers"", go for it. When I finished the book, I wondered why I bothered...."
3,"Good, not great","As a Mozart fan, I was excited to find this book. The story was interesting enough, but the writing was,at times, a little simplistic. Dialogues between characters lacked some depth and seemed simplistic. I did enjoy hearing about Mozart from his wife' s view. All in all, enjoyable and worth a read. I would have appreciated an author' s note at the end outlining some factual details."
2,mozart's wife,"This was such fragmented writing and at times confusing. It could have been written in one half the number of pages. It gives an insight into a woman's life in that period of time. Difficult to say the least. Being a wife to the genius,Mozart, was a challenge. The pain of so many pregnancies and loss of children is heartbreaking. The ups and downs of Mozart's career and personal life were brought to attention by this book. Like so many artists, his was a sad life."
1,Struggled,"I don't give up easily, but after struggling to finish this book, I wish I had. I stayed with it hoping Mozart's wife would develop into a character with whom I could sympathize, but she did not. Such a selfish, self-centered, weak-charactered protagonist was, for me, impossible to like.I honestly don't know how this got so many good reviews; just personal preference, I guess. As a reader who enjoys historical fiction, this was such a disappointment. This should be classified as a romance novel, which I don't care for. Actually, might more aptly be titled ""Mozart's Wife's Chest"", because ""the twins"" seemed to be the star of the novel; evidently no man in the known world was able to resist them, and reference to them are so continuous it gets to be a joke. Especially odd when this is in first-person narrative.I have, however, gained a new appreciation for Mozart. If this was truly a portrait of his wife, then bless his heart, no wonder he was loopy."
4,the story that has it all,"I loved this book. I loved the subject matter. This book is a first person novel from the point of Konstance, the forgotten middle child/abused daughter/naive teenager who would become Mozart's wife. We follow Konstance thru a maze of love, heartbreak, deception, joy, loss, poverty and richness. There are times in the story when I found myself really disgusted with Konstance, she was judgemental, naive, and self-centered but as she matured what you get the sence of is that Konstance is a survivor. I fell in love with Wolfi, even as I was disgusted by him. The characters are so well developed and three dimensional it is easy to kind of 'put yourself in their shoes'. I applaud the author and editior of this tale. If I have any critique at all it is that the book is a little long and little heavy...definately not a light-hearted beach read. But, that too is why I loved it...it was meaty."
5,Idiosyncratic Konstanze,This book was such a pleasure to read. Neither Mozart nor his were presented as unidimensional. The complexity and honesty of the book make it memorable.
4,Too much of a good thing?,"Quoting Mae West ""Too much of a good thing can be wonderful"". This, however should not be said about this CD. The harmonies are fantastic, the arrangements superb, but if you have the feature in your CD player, it is better to randomize the musical numbers with other one of your favorite CD's, or it will unfortunately put you to sleep. I've never liked accordion music too much, but in this CD the arrangements with Art Van Damme in that instrument sound very swingy and appropriate. This of course is my own personal opinion, but if you listen to the samples you'll probably agree with me. To lovers of voice harmonies, this is one that shouldn't be missed, though."
4,Marble Run Review,"This game is great for kids with short attention spans because there is so much to see and do. It can be hard to see how to assemble the pieces to make the models in the instructions, but you don't have to follow those, you can make up your own. It's almost like legos or lincoln logs but with the added fun of having marbles rolling around your creation. I'd highly recommend this for hours of fun for kids, teenagers, and even adults!"
2,Waste of money,"We bought this for our 4 yr. old son, who loves marble machines and it didn't last a week. The spiral runs are very weak and got bent out of shape with one accidental fall off the table. After that everything else went down hill. We were never able to get it to work again. Also the mechanical part was very difficult to put together. [...] I was extremely disappointed with this toy."
2,Disappointment,"This toy is flimsy at best, the instructions are just example pictures and are not good if you want to know specifically which side goes on what side. So it is only when you run the marbles you'll learn if the ""planks"" are on the wrong side. If they are then you have to partly disassemble to get it corrected. The marbles are smaller than regular marbles so if you lose any you cannot use just any ol' marble (won't fit thru openings). The motor/elevator was broken when we got it (new) but my husband spent time splicing the wires until it worked. I think the magnetic marble run that I've seen in stores are better, the K""Nex run is good, too. This toy was just a big disappointment."
1,Way too much trouble to put together- NO INSTRUCTIONS!,"My son got this for his 6th birthday and it looked like it would be so much fun. But not so, it took so much time to put these little (2"") sections of tubes together to form any kind of simple structure that all the fun was lost. We got the motor working and the elevator that carried the marble up worked fine, that was the highlight of the toy. But, we simply did not find that building a connecting structure like in the picture was remotely possible without a lot of patience and trial and error. The worst of it was that it DID NOT COME WITH ANY INSTRUCTIONS!! We returned it to Amazon.com after two attempts to have fun with it. My son played with a similar toy at his after school center, but the tubes were in longer sections and they were super easy to snap together so he and others could create elaborate connections for the marbles to run on, if I can find that kind, I would buy it. I do not recommend this toy."
3,Quercetti Marble Run,"Poor instructions make the run difficult to build. Also it is not steady so a slight push can affect the flow of the marbles. Once built, the run seemed to hold my grandsons' (aged 4 and 6) interest for quite a while and they played with it several times during a five-day visit. Since they left the toy here and their visits are infrequent, it is not possible to know if it would continue to interest them over the long run."
4,Fun toy!,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this marble run for my 4 year old son for Christmas. He loves it! It was easy to assemble and I love that there are other building options as well. I like the fact that it sticks together and doesn't fall apart after a little bump or nudge. This helps us keep the pieces together so it can be enjoyed for an even longer time!"
1,Not worth the trouble,"We bought this marble set for our daughter at a local toystore.First, there are no instructions on how to put it together, you have to go by the picture on the front of the box.My wife then spent an hour trying to put the set together in a different configuration, but the plastic curves would only assemble one way and that meant that the rest of the set couldn't be reconfigured. The marbles would get stuck trying to go around the curves.We took it back. Disappointing toy."
2,Flimsy and difficult to use,"This is very hard to setup, rather flimsy and not much fun. The a fairly generic marble set that we got at a garage sale is more versatile, more user friendly and a whole lot cheaper than this. Just NOT worth the money."
1,Quercetti Marble Run with Motorized Elevator.,Grandchild broke it within hours by adding Mega marbles to the game. Somehow it should state that the Mega Marbles cannot be used with Quercetti Marble Run game.
1,The worst toy ever,This is the worst toy I have ever bought. It is very misleading and not worth the money. My grandson was very disappointed because he wanted a elevator. When he first saw it he was excited but while helping him to put it together I very quick;y realized that it does not do what it says and he lost interest real fast. That was a hard earned wasted $50. The only reason I didn't return it was because I had thrown away my paperwork because I was sure he was going to enjoy it. Wow was I wrong!!! So I had to go out and purchase another birthday gift. I am highly upset and disappointed.
1,Wish Amazon gave more detailed description,"We had previously purchased the Quercetti 80 piece marble run and had a lot of fun with it. Want to build more complicated runs we got the 180 piece with the motorized elevator. We thought with 180 pieces we could build much larger marble runs, boy where we disappointed... As soon as I got the package from Amazon and read the outside of the box I felt duped in the count of 180 pieces counts each link in the chain to make up the elevator , by the time you count all the parts to complete the elevator the marble run isn't much if any bigger than the 80 piece, it just has an elevator."
4,Worth the money for the elevator,"My son really likes his marble run - especially the elevator! I'm so glad we spent the extra money on it. It's very easy to assemble and both my kids have a lot of fun working the elevator and watching the marbles in the vortex. It seems pretty sturdy (needs to be re-leveled at times), although a 1 year old can easily destroy it if they get the chance. (I found that out when my neighbor's 14 month old caught hold of it) So, if you have other little ones, keep it out of their reach for that reason and because of the choking hazard with the marbles. My only real complaint is that the directions didn't come with more layouts. (We did come up with our own that worked quite well though!) Overall, great educational toy to have on hand. Stores easily in its box."
1,Terrible toy - elevator doesn't work,"This Christmas gift was a huge disappointment. We own another Quercetti Marble Run that we've had for 7 years and love, so picked this one out as an addition to that set. The kids (ages 10 & 4) were mostly interested in the motorized elevator. Well ... We worked on this for an hour and can't get the elevator to work right. There seem to be too many links in the chain and it is too slack to work right with the cogs and pulley system. When we removed a link, then it was then too tight and pulled the supporting tower over every few seconds. the red ""cups"" that carry the marbles up to the top also kept catching on the supporting base structure and falling off. NOTHING seemed to work right with the elevator portion of this toy ... Which is why we bought it. It's too expensive to just keep just to use as an addition to our regular set. This will be in the return mail tomorrow."
2,"falls apart easily, very cheap","The idea for this toy is great but the implementation not so good. The chain that you put together that pulls the elevator is the worst because you snap all of the links together only to discover that they give you too many links for it to fit snugly around the gears. Then, when you pull it apart to take out some pieces, the plastic stretches and the chain perpetually breaks. The plastic is so lightweight and the assembly to flimsy that it breaks again and again. If continuous fixing is your child's idea of fun, or your idea of an ""educational toy,"" then maybe this is for your family, but for my kids it was frustrating."
2,Not great. Keep Looking,Simply not a great product. we are thinking about sending this back because our son can not put this together.
2,Quercetti Marble run with Moterized elevator 177 pieces,This set was extremely hard to put together and very unstable once it is together. Not a toy for kids!
2,Fun but flimsy,We loved this concept as a toy and it was fun while it lasted but pieces kept breaking and it fell apart easily. We really liked the toy though so when we bought the next one we upgraded to the much more expensive quadrilla marble run and that's been amazing. It is all wood and indestructible and the kids have been playing with it for several years now.
2,"Instructions, anyone?","This is a product from a different country. There are no instructions and I have had a frustrating time trying to put it together. I was really excited about this because of the motorized elevator, but I would recommend that a person go with the less complicated, more directions and less cost marble run for their kids."
3,Big hit but...,I gave this to my grandson (6 years old) for Christmas. He really had a great time playing with it. The only but I have was it was VERY time consuming putting it together. There were really no directions - just pictures - and they were not very clear. We did have a little trouble keeping the links together since they just press together but overall it was a great success
4,fun for the whole family,my son loves this thing. lots of fun. he hasn't stopped playing with it since Christmas day. I plan on getting the bigger one soon
4,Coolest toy ever! but so long to assemble.,"I love that this has the elevator, so my 6 year old son doesn't have to keep stopping and putting the marbles back on top; it does it for you! It is so fun, we just sit there for a long time together watching and fooling around with it.My only complaint is the time it takes to put this thing together. You have to be careful because until every last piece is on, it is so flimsy that it can easily fall over and break, and then you have to start all over again.Also, there is no way my son could build this on his own. Adult assembly is definitely required. And lots and lots of patience!Once it's up and running though, THIS IS THE COOLEST TOY EVER!"
2,Flimsy,"Bought this for my daughter a couple of years ago. She has fun with it, but is always very frustrated with how flimsy and unstable the structure is. The motorized part does not always pick up the marbles and it is very hard to find replacement parts if pieces break or go missing. Overall, not good value for money. The wooden marble structures look far more stable."
1,Total Rip-off Piece of Junk.,"Do not buy this toy. It does not work. Very narrow window for return so if you are not quick with returns you will be stuck with it. Parts do not line up, flimsy and way too expensive. Amazon should not allow them to sell on their website."
2,Querceti marble run,Flimsy construction. Marble is not always in a downward spiral-no matter what you do. Took a long time to assemble and doesn't stay together well. Disappointed with this product.
4,Christmas present,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my son. Although he loves the motorized elevator on it, I would probably get it without next time. There is not much versitility or imagination in setting it up correctely. OR if you can afford both, I would get this one with the 224 piece vortis set."
2,Looks fun but directions are horrible,"We gave this to our kids for Christmas and the directions were horrible. Our 7YO (who frequently constructs Lego sets rated for age 12+) got frustrated and even when I gave it a try, it wasn't possible to see all the connection points in the directions. Not sure if our package was missing some directions or what, but we sent this back. For almost $50 there are better toys out there."
5,Wow I love my Citizen Calibre 2100 Eco-Drive,"It's the watch I now wear every day. Almost everyday someone new compliments me on it. I will be interested though to see how well the solar cell holds up over time, since this is my first experience with a watch that is powered by solar energy. Still, this watch is the best I've purchased in a long time and I'm very satisfied thus far."
5,This is a great watch!,"Initially I was hesitant about this watch because I noticed that some people said that watch was heavy and too big, however, I am very pleased with how it fits.Before buying it I went to Macy's and tried on the titanium version, which felt alright.After buying it I took it to Fred Meyer to get 3 links taken off. The watch tech said that the band is prone to breaking later down the road due to some special pins that it has. Although the watch was not charged very much when I arrived, putting it on the window sill during one sunny weekend charged it fully.After a couple months of wearing the watch to work 5 days a week I have grown to love this watch. The weight and size is perfect for my average wrist. I highly recommend getting this watch."
4,Nice Watch,"It is big, nice looking and people notice it on your arm.I am satisfied.PS It also works :-)"
5,Superb watch for the price.,"At first I must say it's a bit risky to buy a watch on the internet before you have seen it. But in this case i got really lucky. The watch was a little bigger than I expected, but as soon as i got used to the size (took about one hour) i think it's great. I was thinking about getting the titanium version because of the low weight, but i liked the color and the layout a lot better on this one. I don't think the weight is a problem at all. So far I've had the watch for about one month, and i like it better each day. The only minor vulnerability of the watch is that the glass is the uppermost part of it. I have gotten one little scratch so far, but i don't think it will be a big problem.The watch looks great, and I expect it to last several years. My last watch was a Citizen eco-drive too, and it ran problem-free for 12 years! Well done, Citizen!"
5,excellent buy,This product is truly an excellent buy. The shipment was prompt and this watch has all the features you'll ever need. I recommend this strongly for anyone who wants an exceptional product at a reasonable price.
2,There is no joy in this book.,"Although the author writes well, this was an unpleasant book to read throughout. By its end, after having been dragged through fields of corpses, bodiless heads, manure, blood, pointless sex, and futility, I wanted no more. With the exception of Parsival during the time of his complete innocence, I didn't care what happened to the characters. Although the writer probably gave a realistic picture of just how unclean and vile the age of knighthood might really have been, he did not balance it with any hint of beauty. All this might have been forgivable if justified by the ending, but the whole story just dribbles away at the last."
4,Elis Sees The Future,"This is a fantastic album. It's especially notable for the fact that in 1966, 21-year-old Elis Regina sought to use her already-considerable popularity and influence to popularize a bunch of then-unknown (in Brazil) songwriting talent on the order of Gilberto Gil, Edu Lobo, Milton Nascimento, Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque--that's to say, almost the whole upper-crust of the great MPB generation. To look at the writing credits on this album, you'd think it was made in, say, 1973 instead of the mid-60s. And her voice already had that fiery edge and swing, although she was still quite young, and had yet to work out some of the subtleties of nuance and shading that would make her later work so captivating. Cut for cut though, this is still one of the most important albums of the 60s in Brazil, and yes, she IS better than Dusty Springfield...."
2,Get what you pay for.,Iodex is becoming both increasingly scarce and expensive. I should have bit the bullet and bought another jar of Iodex instead of this crap. Nothing draws infection out of and heals a wound like Iodex.
1,useless ...,it is a foul smelling useless product. I ordered this after reading the reviews ... and so far nothing!
4,Does a good job.,"I had a thorn in my thumb. I ordered Prid because it would not come out. It took several days for it to work, but it did."
5,Prid Drawing Salve,Used this when I was a kid. It helped bring the Infection to a neat end. My father used this something lke this when he was a kid.It really helped my problem..
2,Allergic reaction,I am a big fan of Hyland`s products. After reading all other reviews of this product I ordered it. After just using it for couple times I got a pretty strong allergic reaction on the skin. Beware of this potential complication.
5,WOW! excellent product,"I recently purchased Prid, which is a drawing salve. I love it and could not find it in my area. The Prid was received by me within three days. Excellent service. Would purchase again. I purchased through Amazon."
3,Not completely natural.,"I am a little mixed about this product. It is not completely natural: it has parabens and for that i took a star off. While it does work on scratches, it is not a miracle product for me: it does take a while to work and it does not prevent scaring. I guess every body responds differently to this."
2,work on moles?,really didnt work on moles at all ! I dont know about anythig else. used it for two weeks and not a thing.
2,not so good,"This product did not work for me at all. it didnt even speed up the process or nothing. I used it for almost a week with no difference. too bad, it got really good reveiws from othet people."
5,Prid Works!,"I developed an infection or blockage (whatever) on the outside cheek of my rear end. Nothing was working and it seemed to be getting sorer and more severe. I tried heat and a supposed penetrating acne medication but no luck.Finally I did a search for drawing salve (remembering it from when I was young) and Prid came up in the search. I've used it for three days and while not an instant miracle, it comes close. Within 8-12 hours from the initial application I changed the bandage when I woke up. There is no question it was already working. The soreness is gone and the area is still draining, now less than 1/2 the size it was.So while I thought so many reviews were exaggerations I now know better. The stuff works. It's not a soft salve in that you need to use something to spread it on a bandage or whatever you're putting against the afflicted area. But at the price, it will become a staple in my med cabinet."
4,"Works as described, but takes time","I tried it overnight for a week or more and didn't notice any change in my cyst or whatever is on my neck. I started using it on a bandaid all day and within a week my cyst started sweeling and then drained for a few days. I'm waiting for my Doctor's prescription to finish it up, hopefully."
5,"LOVE IT BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET ""NEW"" PRODUCT","I have use this before and works like a charm. This order in particular seemed to be old as it was not dark in color and was not creamy. It is also supposed to have a scent to it. This one did not and did not do the job. When applied, you are supposed to feel it drawing the boil out and usually works in a day."
4,travel size,this was a nice size to travel with . I gave it to my daughter for use so am not sure if it strenght is that of what I was looking for.
5,Totally works!,"I read the reviews and decided to give this a try. My husband has had this big painful bump under his arm for a week and nothing we tried was working. Given he hates Doctors, he agreed to try the Drawing Salve and if it didn't work he'd finally go see a Doctor. Low and behold, three days into using it, the bump is down and the liquid has been draining on its own.Neither my husband nor I were quite sure about this stuff, but it really does work. I wouldn't have believed it had I not seen it work with my own eyes.Highly recommend this salve- saved us a very pricy (and probably painful) visit to the doctor!"
5,GREAT STUFF!!,I have used this Salve for years and NEVER had any problems with it removing everything from steel to glass that got under the skin in my hands. IT is a MUST in all MED Cabinets.AP
4,Beware of remastered statement,"I absolutely love the song selection and concept of the album. I'm a little dissapointed in the sound quality though. It is digitally remastered, but not from the original master tapes. Why bother remastering if your do not remaster from the original source? In my opinion, the sound quality is only one step up from analog. Otherwise, I love it and thanks for reviving it. I'm 44 and this release brings back so many memories. I have been listening to it non-stop since I received it. So - Ross fans - enjoy, even with the poor quality of sound. The cd case is amazing too! Paul - Toronto"
5,An Icon,Diana Ross played a very very important role in history of pop music. Without Ross there would have not been a Whitney Houston or the other divas.She is at one of her vocal and creative peaks on this CD.
3,rehash,"when there are so many lps/recordings still in the vaults at motown that date back much further than this release, why not get started rereleasing those first? Example Martha and the Vandellas,Brenda Holloway,Gladys Knight,Four Tops,and on and on...and I agree with the other contributor that Bonnie Pointer cds should also see the light of day by being released in cd format. My lps are worn thin. I purchased ""Royal Jones"" last week and keep a booppin' off of that meanwhile.....But I do love Diana ,but she should revisit the old unreleased catalogue soon and share those hidden memory gems of hers and her cohorts...all eight of the legitimate supremes. Also Susaye Greenes 'no fear here' is dauntingly marvelous!"
5,Heartwarming,"I started reading the ""Laura"" and her family books when I was about 8 years old. The books would take me back in time and I would be right there with Laura. I loved them and read them over and over again. I am now 52 and once in a while still take one out and read it just to reminisce. I probably always will."
4,new topics for many readers,"The book is a collection of papers that offer a new perspective on the cultural identity of deaf people. The presentation takes the tone that the Deaf [sic] are a definite grouping, with their own cultural mores and afflictions.Much of the text revolves naturally around the education of the Deaf, when they are children. With interesting ""niches"", like immigrant children who are deaf and whose native language is not English. Another topic is those women who are deaf, and who want to improve their social status. Here, there are overlapping handicaps, if you will, between their gender and their disability, which makes their efforts far harder.Other sections discuss the implications of teaching students to be bilingual in American Sign Language and English.The book may have much new material for many readers, if you aren't already in the educational field and teaching deaf students, or if you aren't deaf yourself."
5,nice :3,"Concise information, nice (and lots of) pictures, and NEVER boring! I really enjoyed using this book for my Eastern Humanities class. It was not at all what I had expected: it was not hard to understand, it was not boring, and it did assume that I already knew everything there was to know about Eastern religions.So, all-in-all, I would recommend this book... even if you're not taking an Eastern religion class! It really clarifies a lot of myths and misconceptions about Eastern religions."
3,Global Religions - lack of essence,"The book gives for each of the religions; Hinduism, Buddism, Taoism, Confucianism and Shinto a good structure into main sections; Origins and history, aspects of the divine, sacred texts, ethical priciples, sacred space, death and afterlife and Society and religion. However within each section there is numereous detailed references to names, places, dates and texts.I miss an overview of each section of what is of importance and what has less significanse. Inserting for each section a missing link - an overview pinpoininting esseentials would make the book an recommendable textbook."
2,Light and somewhat gaudy color,Pen is far lighter than I had expected and not very evenly balanced. The resin is far yellower than the image indicated which is a dissapointment. Would not buy another and find it expensive for quality offered.
5,Treasure Chest of Information in an Easy read format!,This book in fantastic. The author's voice and style make this not only easy to read but a joy to read as well. There are little tips and tidbits in each chapter that will make a good audio guy great and a great audio guy better. I recommend this book to anyone in the audio post world.
1,Poor Desighn,"The grip is comfortable to the hands and palms once it is attached....There is NOT enough reinforcement in and around where the screw fits through the grip into the handle and attaches to the gun its's self, what happens is that the screw head opens up the hole that is milled into the grip for the screw to pass through and there is NOTHING for the screw head to hold it to the actual gun body. VERY poor design in my opinion, there should have been some type of reinforcement to allow the pressure of the backside of the screw to actually hold the grip to the gun frame. I have not shot it yet, but my fear is the grip will come loose and actually come off the gun. STAY AWAY from this grip!!!Sincerely,David B"
2,These are nothing special...,These grips detract from the overall look and feel of a classic firearm. They are just cheap rubber grips nothing special like Hogue grips. Plus the screw tends to go right thru the retaining hole and the grips aren't very secure. I prefer the original grips to these with a slip on grip at most.
2,"Almost, but not quite","I have recently finished this disaster of a novel for a college honors course ""Disability through Autobiography."" While attempting to read this book, my frustration took over and in a couple of instances, resulted in the book being thrown across the room. Much of the book seems a criticism of those that are not blind as well as the depictions of the blind by those who are not blind, namely authors and Hollywood directors. I can think of a much better topic for a book than nit-picking at random quotes in movies, books, and social groups. Kleege seems to only show the ability for a blind person to criticize those who are not blind and may not completely understand what blindness is. Although I have taken many courses that focus intensely on accepting those with disablilities in society, I find it very difficult to accept severe cynicism no matter what disability the author may have."
1,What the heck have I just bought!!!,I just can't do it. I can't read another page of this drivel. I would however like to congratulate the author on masterfully turning quite a good premise into such a terribly written book.I really hope you put my five bucks towards getting some writing lessons.
1,i thought it would be more...,I was hopping to get a game that would be as good or better then playing on line what a let down. It is noise in a bad way. The games are very limited and not at all like what you find in real life or online. Seeing that video poker is in the name I thought it would more type of poker like multi-hand poker but no such luck. I'm just happy that I didn't pay more the $0.25 for it.
1,Hoyle Slots and Video Poker (Jewel Case),I bought the video for the poker and it had no poker. Slots are a no brainer activity on the video.
2,NO NO NO!,"I can't believe this i was soo excited about this movie and its horoble! They totally forgot Nicole's(Alexia Nicoles) name when ""Gender Defenders"" was on! That is soo bad!Also I dont get why Zoey wouldn't feel that her TekMat was gone? I mean it has to weigh a little bit on her waist dont u thing i mean nobodys that stupid! This movie isn't horoble overall but it could use somework!Don't waist your money on this stupid movie!"
2,"Nice episodes, but already included in previous seasons","I bought this DVD for my kids since they enjoyed the Season 1 and 2 so very much. Unfortunately all episodes on this disc are also available on the Season 1 and 2 disks. A bit of a disappointment. If you own the seasons already, no need to buy this disk."
3,O.K.,"This dvd is o.k., but they should really have the complete first and second season out! And another thing, I'm soooooo glad they got rid of Dana Cruz! Dana was a real bitch! Even when Dustin was sick and asked for her help, she closed the door on him! Thank god they replaced her with Lola Martinez!!! Lola is much sweeter than Dana will ever be! Also, I hope Nicole comes back from that all girls school! (For those of you who don't know, Nicole was sent to an all girls school because of how much she thought about cute boys!) Nicole Bristow was my favorite character! She was always so cute and happy! Even when she said something stupid, it sounded so cute! Anyway, this dvd is o.k., but I'd still say they should come out with seasons one and two! What's the point of buying only half the episodes?!?"
5,Gift,"This was a christmas present for our Grandaughter, She loves it, thats all I have to say,Thank you very much."
1,Disappointing,"I can understand why this book is out of print. Novick could not decide whether he was writing for the mass market or other law professionals. He evidently gathered abundant research materials, arranged them chronologically, and tried to organize them into coherent chapters. Novick's discomfort in dealing with Holmes' private life results in a rather stilted account of the pivotal events in his life. Novick did not even attempt to connect these events to his works before and after he sat on the Massachusetts bench. Furthermore, no insight whatsoever enlightens our understanding of Holmes' thoughts at the time he rendered his most important judicial decisions. Don't bother trying to find this book now that it has been buried."
4,A must read for those interested in justice and history.,"I read it as a books-on-tape title. I enjoyed listening to it, it was quite fascinating learning about the life of a man who fought in the Civil War and went on to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of the USA; his significant influence into our country's judicial thinking has been a source of inspiration for me to further understand it and its origins"
2,False Advertising...again,"How annoying..in the description for this DVD it says:""Language: ItalianSubtitles: English""this is not the case as the movie is dubbed in English and there are no subtitles. Along with this DVD I purchased another foreign movie with English subtitles only to find it too was dubbed in English...but wait it actually did have English subtitles. That makes sense.Don't waste your money and don't believe the descriptions is my advice."
1,Ole Miss Football Stadium Replica DATED & OLD,"NO Ole Miss Football fan with half a brain would want to purchase any of the enclosed SO-CALLED Replicas of THE VAUGHT...aka Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. WHY, you may ask? Because, of what's obvious to Rebel fans and knowledgable SEC & College Football fans alike, the Stadium Replicas enclosed EXPIRED after the end of the 2000 Football Season. Stadium's SEZ has since been completely bowled-in to increase capacity to 60,580;University AD & other Ole Miss officials currently studying, etc ...when to do the SAME to The Vaught's NEZ, too....bringing stadium capacity to OVER 70K.Hotty Toddy, GO REBS GO!!!And, lest anyone forget or not be aware, Nick 'THE LIAR' Saban's bunch of Pachyderms have their HANDS in the pockets of SEC Football officials!!! Just look and see who was the SEC's ONLY coach to publicly defend SEC officials during their past Season of consistent INEPTITUDE."
3,Well made with a problem,"Product is well made but the pockets are too shallow for ease of carrying tools in the outside pockets. Anything of any length has to go in the bucket, not a pocket."
4,Good tool organizer,"I agree with one of the other posts about the shallow depth of the pockets. Otherwise, I suppose it works as a well constructed organizer."
5,tools,"Got the product as promised. The product is weel woth it. It is very durable. I always wanted one and for the price, it was a great deal."
2,not bad to be milwaukee,"since the milwaukee company sold out to ryobi, the quality and workmanship have declined dramatically, but since there are no mechanical parts on a canvas bag to go cheap on, they couldnt mess it up to bad!!"
2,Interesting but not completely convincing,The redemptive movement approach is helpful for looking at slavery and the place of women because there are a lot of Biblical texts concerning slaves and women. It is much less helpful for considering homosexuality because there are simply not enough texts dealing specifically and unambiguously with homosexuality to show much movement.
2,Couldn't keep his horse in the furrow,"Webb has some gold that he mined out... with the redemptive movement thought. However, the book was left wanting. He sets uo the ""rules"" by which scripture is examined and lo and behold when he goes to scripture he find things that make his point. When scripture conflicts with where he is going then it is merely background noise... not something significant.He goes to the Bible and finds it to say exactly what he desires it to say rather than letting the living scripture speak. It was a massive struggle to finish the book."
2,"Good things, but seriously flawed","Without going into too much detail, the main problem with this book is that it fails to recognize that in the ancient world women and slaves were part of everyone's everyday life - and that homosexuality, as we understand it today, was totally unknown. For the author to say that the Bible's attitude towards women and slaves can undergo a change but not towards homosexuality is to place his whole thesis on a false footing. When the Bible says: ""This is wrong"" we have to be sure what 'THIS' is!It is entirely unclear what was being condemned in the 5 scriptural texts which are used to prevent gays from having loving, supportive relationships similar to the one for which Dr. Webb thanks his wife in the Acknowledgments pages."
1,"One Man's Opinion, Not Trans-Cultural Ethic","All Mr. Webb has proven is that some prejudices are more deeply intrenched in our protean cultures than others. Prejudices against women and the accepted practice of enslaving people were somewhat quicker (ironic as it is to use that word) to evaporate in the light of truth and human dignity. Every thoughtful Christian I know firmly believes that homophobia will go the same way as slavery and the subjugation of women. Mr. Webb presents no evidence to the contrary. All he does say is that it is his opinion, and the opinion of his circle, which he mistakenly takes for universal truth.On the other side of the debate, John McNeill, John Boswell, Fr. Daniel Helminiak, Robin Scoggs, and many more deeply spiritually wise writers have far stronger arguments than Mr. Webb's.This is all unfortunate because in other respects he is more or less a logical thinker and an exemplary writer."
2,Not as expected,"There is not a ""no-limit"" option, the ""tutorial"" constitutes them telling you what they think you should do (no explanation as to why... difficult to learn from). The software has glitches."
4,Texas Hold Em,"The Texas Hold em CD was easily installed and doesn't require the disc to play. Characters are amusing and can be adjusted to your liking. Overall, it's a lot of fun."
3,Hoyle Texas Hold 'Em Poker by Encore,"This game is alright, but I prefer ""Texas Hold 'Em: High Stakes Poker (Jewel Case)"" by ValuSoft. I just found it to be a more enjoyable game... in my opinion anyways."
5,What a wonderful book I didn't want to put it down.,"Dear Ginna Gray, I just loved this book what a brilliant story. The story was excellent and the characters were wonderful especially Mike and Leah I was really rooting for them to get together. I have now read the other books in the series and I hope there will be another about Molly and Quinton to finish of this wonderful series."
5,Delicious,"Makes an excellent, homemade-tasting stock for your next batch of gumbo. Friends had no idea this came from a box, and I wound up making about 40 servings!"
4,A small book about big hair,"One of the authors of ""Bad Hair"" is back with another off-the-wall collection of atrocious but funny Do's. But this time, they are so voluminous that they make Marge Simpson's hair look like a crew cut. The photos, gathered from window displays of hair salons, depict a dazzling array of outrageously hairy heads. Frizzed, teased, poufed, upswept, sculpted, bobbed, and coerced into outsized and unnatural shapes, these hairstyles are not for the faint of heart. Captions would have enhanced the presentation of these masterpieces."
4,Kurt Cobain,Kurt Cobain was one of the best lead singers of a band in history. This book shows him for what he really was. He lives on in our memories forever. We love you Kurt.
4,Exceptional,I must say cobain was not the voice of my generation. He was a very talented musician who broke into the scene when the 80's blah was over! It was awesome learning how difficult is was for Nirvana to hit it big. Reading about the odd jobs and the people who turned them down. It cool the way they struggled and reading it in the wire journal format was another nice touch. If it had been transcribed into plan typed text would have made it horrible. Courtney Love is Real Trash but thank god she sold the journals and opened up this to the getting old X Genertation. If you graduated in 91' like me then read this!
2,Can't Bring Myself to Read the whole thing,"OK so I bought this book and I started reading through it, after a while I felt like I was somehow violating someone's privacy, well Kurt's privacy obviously. I really think these journals should have been left unpublished, something for his daughter to read when she is older in order to gain some insight into this amazing man, but not something his fans should have access too. That's just my opinion and I am in no way trying to guilt anyone into not buying it."
4,Behind the Hype,"The book ""Journals"" by Kurt Coabain captures the very essence of the way he lived and wrote his music. You can feel the depressing tone in his writing. Beyond his tiny scribble you can see the pain in everything he wrote. The problems and events in his life defined him. ""Journals"" really brings you inside Cobains soul.Many people will argue that ""Journals"" should't be sold. Thats it too private to be seen, or that it's just another way that Courtney Love is trying to make money off of Kurt's death, but I don't feel that way. For any true fan of Kurt Cobain or Nirvana jouranls is a must read."
4,The Soul of Pain,I am not a Nirvana fan nor a Kurt Cobain fan. I picked this book up at Borders because I like the intimacy of journals. I could not put it down. You can't help but connect with his spirit and emotions if you have a broad enough perspective on life.It is fascinating from an artistic and psychological viewpoint.Everyone that picked this up at my house on Christmas Day wanted their own copy. So here I am!!
5,Shades of Kurt...,"Kurt strikes many of us as a friend we never knew so we read in hopes of learning more about our friend... I struggled with reading these given his request that we don't but my desire as a fan to feel close to his words pulled me in and I could not put it down. I fear that we are only seeing what CL allowed us to see so any insights will be based on fractured memories but this small sliver absolutely gives you a better feel for his ""sense and sensibility"". When you put the book down, it is impossible not to weep because he is no longer with us for absolutely no reason. We need truth to get closure and we may never get it. If only he knew how many people truly understood his point of view, then I think there might have been a shelter for him. Brilliant? Yes. He is missed but his thoughts and point of view are still hovering with us. Thank you Kurt for staying true to yourself."
4,"How about some notes, Courtney?","You can read everything in print about Kurt but there's nothing like a look inside his head via his hand written journal entries.It's the actual hand writing that got to me. There's something about the act of putting pen to the page that seems more immediate. The crossed out words and phrases, the doodling, the side tracked thoughts--it's fascinating to see it all preserved on notebook paper. The quality of the reproductions is uncannily sharp.Considering that Courtney exercises tremendous control over Kurt's estate, plus, given her own writing talent, I was surprised that she didn't annotate more of the journals. The drafts of the songs could've used some dating. I would've enjoyed some pointed commentary from her, even. Since the notes are printed very unobtrusively in the back, she could've added much more without destroying the immediacy of the journal entries."
1,Decisions,"I've chosen not to read this book, for a number of reasons. Firstly, even if Kurt did intend his journals to be read, we'll never know, so its not right to publish them. Is it right to publish work without someones permission? No.Also, these are not ALL Kurt's entries or writings, they've been editied, so can you trust them?As a Nirvana fan, and a Kurt fan, I don't think it's right to read this, especially as theyre published by Courteney Love, (indirectly) and I don't tust her, her involvement with Kurt's death, or her involvement with the infamous note at all.So make your own choice. Would Kurt want you to read these writings or not? I'l never know, so I'm going to give him the respect and not read them. Read his lyrics. Thats what he shared with the world, not necesarily his diary."
1,Disturbing,"I'm a huge fan of Nirvana, but this is totally wrong. Kurt must be spinning in his grave, this would have given him a heart attack. I didn't read the whole book (I just read an excerpt here on amazon)Kurt had already felt uncomfortable with all the praise and fame he got, and then ten years later, this is released? Also, some of the pages had some words cut off, it's heavily censored.I deeply respect Kurt, and all that he's done with his band, but this is horrible.Come on, he had a bad life, let the guy rest in peace.-buy In Utero or Nevermind instead. It'll make you happy knowing you did the right thing."
3,Kurt Cobain Journals: veteraition or violation?,"There are now two types of fans, Cobain fans and Nirvana fans.If you are a fan of Kurt Cobain buy it, if not rather buy yourself another one of Nirvana's CD's. The dark and disturbing drawings are good and would give art therapists a field day! But I have to wonder, why are there no dates in his journals? Even his biggest fan would ask the same question.Save your money and Kurt's face on meaningful scribbles of a tortued soul who sadly lost his grip."
3,"""... Me""","I don't know if it really matters how you rate this book. A journal is a journal, and I bet Cobain didn't intend for a bunch of phonies to go and read his private journals. However, I did go and read it. The size of the book is a little deceiving. There aren't many words in the book (for it's size), and I read it within 2 days (it's that short). He pretty much talks about the same thing over and over in it, and there are pages where the words are exactly the same, but in a different format. For example: one page shows a handwritten rough draft, a second rough draft, and a final typed version. I felt guilty reading this... there was also a sense of phoniness... when I come to think of it, I don't really know if these could really be Kurt Cobains journal entries because the handwriting is different on each writing, and it seems that the writings always start off on the right hand side of an open journal. I say, go ahead and judge for yourself."
1,Greedy violation of a great man's privacy,"Kurt Cobain, may his soul rest in peace, was a great artist and a beautiful human being. His music changed the lives of millions and helped give an identity to countless disaffected youth. Buying this book is doing the greatest disservice to him that I can possibly think of: you are personally lining with gold the pockets of Courtney Love and the greedy publishing company executives who made this rape of Cobain's thoughts possible. If you are a true fan--no, a true human being, you will allow Kurt Cobain to rest. If you feel a need to peek into his thoughts, buy his albums."
5,Dream Come True,"Nirvana Journals is a great book that I have been waiting for for a long time. It is a dream come true. I love Nirvana and this book is the best book in the world. It shows the pages in which Kurt put together his famous songs, and shows some of the lines that Kurt could of put in the song but decided not to. Nirvana Journals is definately a must buy."
3,This Makes Me Sick,"It is incrediably sad that the corporate, capitalist monsters who took all pleasure out of the music business for Kurt Cobain is now takeing his most personal writeings and publishing them. It is a final, scathing betrayal. It is not your place to read his innermost scrawlings or to contemplate on his very personal suicide. The fact that Courtney Love allowed these journals to be published, that she even considered it, only demonstrates just how much of an enabler she was in her relationship with Kurt Cobain. How could any wife who loved her husband allow the very people he hated more than anything else publish his deepest and most private thoughts? The fact this exists makes me sick. Haveing not read it myself, I give it three stars for lack of a no star option.-A Fan"
1,Exploitive and disappointing,"It's not difficult to believe the young publishing gatekeepers in New York, similar to the young filmmaking gatekeepers in Hollywood, would think this peek inside a troubled young musicman's heart and mind is gonna be a big-seller. And they're probably right becauser that's been a good recipe for success in the past, from Elvis to Jim Morrison to Janis Joplin. But it's difficult to see what good can come of these diaries. Reading them, there's a sense of voyeurism more than purpose. Should we not be improved by such a painful tale?Let's hope we all have people in our lives who will guard our memories better than Kurt Cobain's survivors have done with his."
1,What a awful piece of crap!,"I think this book is terrible.There are just some things a person should never write down on paper.We all have some pretty weird thoughts at times,but we dont write them down so some day a person that doesnt have our best interests at heart can publish them for her own personal gain.YUCK:(-...I noticed there wasnt one word in this book to make you know who look bad in any way.How can she sleep at nights...The only good thing to come out of all the wasted time I spent on this book was I didnt pay for it.I work at a book store so I borrowed it.If I see any one even interested in it I will tell them dont bother it sucks."
2,Can't read most of it,"i got this book as a bad b-day gift. I'm a 27 year old female , why would i want this book now? (i used to be a fan of nirvana's.) the book gives a look inside kurt's thoughs but it's very hard to read some of the pages. Not all entries are typed out, the hand writen ones are almost impossible to read."
1,Boycott,"All fans of Nirvana know it was stated in Kurt Cobain's will that these journals were not to be printed."" Journals"", as well as ""Heavier Than Heaven"", are just apart of Courtny Love's money making scheme.Boycott ""Journals"" and ""Heavier Than Heaven"" if you care at all about the santety of a dead man."
1,Journals by Kurt Cobain,"I was deeply saddened by Kurt's death all those years ago - it really affected me even though I didn't know him but I thought I did. I wish I didn't buy this book, as now I am completely dissallousioned. He was a tortured sole and it really disturbed me. I wish that I could have just remembered all the great songs he wrote.Oh well, whatever, nevermind."
4,Its kinda cool for a coffee table book,Its cool for a coffee table book. But as far as heavy reading goes the content simply isnt there..
5,simply amazing,"I know it simply contains ones diary. however, arent diaries some of the most fascinating pieces of literature ever? havent you wanted to just sneak a peek into someones diary before? still, for all nirvana fans, this is a must have. i guarantee every time you read it, you will learn something new about the twisted and beautiful mind of kurt cobain. this book is a beautifuly crafted piece of art on the insight into the feelings and life of the grunge king. never before has anyone quite understood what was going through his head, now we have at least an idea. once again, i love this book, i can not put it down(and i rarely ever get past the first 50 pages of a book) YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,sick,"This re-release is a slap in the face. Kurt Cobain was an intelligent man, he would not have thought much of the easy dollar exploitation culture the Nirvana legacy has fast become. Just listen to Rape Me - talk about life imitating art."
1,Courtney cashing in,"Kurt would be appalled by this blatant attempt to cash in on his innermost thoughts by his vulture wife.In tribute to Kurt's memory, don't waste your money on this garbage, which is clearly heavily censored. Instead, check out the book Who Killed Kurt Cobain, which, if nothing else, definitively proves that Kurt was in the process of divorcing Courtney at the time of his death because (surprise! surprise!) he believed she was an opportunist who was attempting to cash in on his fame and fortune."
5,courtney did what she did..,"From the reviews...courtney love did what she did to preserve the private life of kurt and herself and probably many other things, so she took out stuff she didnt want the whole world to know!! It seems like everyone wants to know EVERYthing about kurt, life can't be like that. IT seems like she keeps the stuff mainly about rock and roll and music...less the personal experiences...its a JOURNAL!. This is all based off the reviews, honestly I havent read the book, but people told me about it."
1,Courtney appaling to The Cobain Legacy,Well to put out a man's personall thoughts and his private notes i think is appling. I got his journals from a friend for christmas and to tell ya the truth i felt guilty have it its full of pictures (Scale Drawings) of Kurt how he think he looks on the inside. Also its full of letter he never ever sent to any of his fame or family. I think Courtney Love Should burn in hell for what she done to Kurt She doesnt deserve to have his child. Also why did Kurt Mysteriously die well i think its because Courtney found out he was gonna devorce her and she knew she wouldnt get anything when he died.
2,Hmmmm.....,"Well, I must say, I am a 21 year old male who can really relate to alot of Nirvanas music, so I decided to check out Kurts personal journals to kind of get more of a fix. I must say I don't feel very comfortable reading another persons PRIVATE journal, even if it is one of my rock idols'. It's really like you're reading the actual thing, they really made it feel like it. It's basically a bunch of Kurts personal rambling angst ridden inserts that don't really make much sense unless you know his timeline pretty well. I would STRONGLY ADVISE YOU NOT TO GET THIS JOURNAL though. It's his personal stuff that no one else should read. It really can make you feel uncomfortable. People making profit off of Kurts private thoughts is really quite sickening. I would suggest getting the Biography instead.. Much more intertaining, and comfortable read about the man."
5,AWESOME!,This book is simply great. I'm very impressed with its quality and have learned a lot about this iconic figure by reading Kurt's entries. I hope everyone picks up a copy! = )
1,Invasion of Piracy,"I thought the release of Kurt Cobain's Journals was a sick shot at a quick buck. Everything you can read in these journals is already in his songs. That should be enough. Kurt must be rolling over in his grave right now. Someone as private as he, being exploited to the fullest. Punching a dead man below the belt. How very tacky. I'm glad to see the media is still not afraid to push aside any decency for human beings,dead or alive. The release of K.C's Journals summed up in one word, ""Sickening."" Thanks for making me nauseous."
4,Longing for more!,"Well, if you are looking for a plot or story...this may not be your book, however, this is a very interesting look into the late, great Kurdt Cobains mind, pre-fame and in the early stages of his celebrity.Although, I do feel/believe that there are most likely some missing/deleted entries, I still greatly enjoyed ""getting to know"" this wonderful person. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys biographical works.I especially enjoyed the fact that the pages are copied directly from his journal, and not typed or rewritten."
4,Good Condition.,The book arrived fairly quickly and was in excellent condition. It could have arrived sooner though.
2,Corporate Profit,"The publication of these diary entries represents yet another attempt to profit from a resurrected rock icon image. There is nothing new here--nothing that we did not know before about Kurt--nothing we could not have read about in the several biographies on him.Reading these diary entries is incredibly eerie and depressing. We tread into a private domain where we do not belong--and i dare say, no one belongs. We need to allow the dead to rest in peace. PLE."
1,Don't look upon words that do not belong to you.,"I am as big a fan of Nirvana as you can become. Reading his journals is disrespedting his life. I wouln't want anyone reading mine, so why would I read his.As for the guy who dosen't understand why Cobain was as big as he was, well then he can't understand. His sound is 70's and 80's. He can't possibly understand. Nirvana was a sound for the rock audience that had no star. His views are inconsistent. He reflects his own feelings rather than understanding Cobain's importance. If he dosen't like him why is he reading his personal journals? Nirvana stopped, but Cobain lives in his music.Listen, make up your own decision on whether or not to read this book. However, the best way to understand Cobain is to hear his voice,and listen to his music!Please ignore the first review. He simply is not a fan therefore can only give angst. All apologies sir."
1,[],"The publication of this book was a violation of Kurt Cobain's privacy; Courtney Love is reaping the benefits of his thoughts, and no true Nirvana fan would support her endeavor to exploit her husband and keep the earnings."
3,I Wish I Never Read This,"I am giving it three stars not because of it being boring or uninteresting, which it wasn't but rather because I no longer have a hero. I used to believe Kurt was this amazing, creative artist but instead, all he was a manic-depressive, selfish drug addict. There was nothing amazing in the end about him.I will always love his music, always will treasure how it touched me but after reading this.. I will not see him in the same light. It hurts knowing someone that I had respected was not what I had thought him to be.I recommend this to music fans and to music historians. I wouldn't recommend it to someone that revered Kurt, simply because it will change your perspective, sadly."
2,Depressing,"""Journals"" is sad and depressing. If Cobain's music brought joy to you, as it did to so many, this (especially) won't be for you. The purpose of books, as I see it, is to entertain. There's really nothing entertaining here, just sadness. If you want to be entertained, read ""No One's Even Bleeding"" or ""Delano"". At least you'll get a laugh."
3,Fascinating read......but.......,"This book was very fascinating, but you get the feeling throughout that it has been edited--and strangely altered in places that look like someone has scratched things out, and in a different handwriting, made corrections to his words. Not a huge amout of insight in to the man, other than seeing his original lyrics in his own hand writing and a few rough drafts of personal letters he wrote, along with some interesting doodles. People looking for deep insight, won't get more than lyric sheets and lists of his favorite bands.....and you'll be left feeling sort of creepy when you're done."
3,Respect for the Dead,"I picked up a copy of the journals in a bookstore, took one look at the words ""Don't read my diary when I'm gone,"" and put it back down.Yes, I know that it also says, ""please read my diary...figure me out,"" and after the careful weighing of these opposing requests, I may read the journals myself--but I hope not.I'm not condemning, I'm just saying really think about what you're doing when you choose to go past the first page. There's a better chance he would not have wanted these to be made public.And if you knew for sure he wanted them kept private, would you read them anyway?"
4,Notebook of a genius,"This is definitely fascinating reading material for anyone remotely interested in Kurt. However, I'm only giving the book four stars because perhaps some editorial additions could have provided more background on when the notes were written and what was going on in Kurt's life at the time. Some people, including perhaps Chris from Nirvana, think it was an ... thing to publish these journals. I have to say I partially agree that it is a bad thing, but on the other hand it makes you feel closer to Kurt to be able to read about some of these ideas. At times I found this book depressing, and at other times I found it extremely humorous. I think Kurt actually had a great sense of humor, in spite of his demons. He is an immortal rock god. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
3,Not as revelaing as I thought,"As a huge fan of Nirvana and one who thinks Kurt is the Dylan of Gen-X, I was really looking forward to reading this. I had read all the reviews from ""pious"" Nirvana fans who thought that no one should read this and all I have to say to them is get a clue. Everything about Cobain was contrived, including this. His plan was simple: get famous, hate fame, kill yourself, leave behind ""mysterious"" scriblings that fan the fame of legend. If these notes were so private why do they reveal so little. Don't get me wrong, I think Cobain was a genius with melody and his talent is greatly missed but gimme a break with the Kurt didnt want this read"
3,"Great insight into tortured brilliance, but not right","People have and will be debating whether or not releasing Kurt's journals (and bear in mind that this is only a collection of a portion of Kurt's journals that Courtney has allowed to be reproduced, so don't expect answers to all of the gnawing questions that will be plaguing fans' minds for years) is moral or ethical, and to put it simply ""no"" it is not ethical at all.But, should this keep you from reading them? ""No"" As I said, Courtney has control over what is released, therefore do not expect anything too earth shattering. You will learn alot about Kurt, his frame of mind, and his obsessions, but there will be nothing that will change the face of rock n' roll like ""Nevermind"" did and you will not learn anything about the nagging rumors regarding the final days of Kurt or Nirvana and ths Journals only add fuel to the fire of the mythology surrounding Kurt's tragic death...."
5,Kurt,Oh my gosh! This book is great! The moment I read the first page...I found myself taken back in time and see thro Kurt's eyes...this book is wonderful!
3,America Inc.,"I received this book for Christmas with the same struggle of conscience that I think that a lot of people feel towards its release. All rationalizations aside, the nature with which some dissect and devour the journal despite (and even as a result of) the fact it's release is so ironically antithetical to its author certainly speaks volumes more about us than its content does about him. Realistically, however, I'll likely keep and read it in another ten years or so. Maybe reading the journals will help me reflect on who I was and what I believed while the winds of celebrity blew Kurt Cobain too close to the sun."
1,dont buy this,i dont think any true nirvana fan should buy this because kurt didnt want it to be bought be would never let anyone read it and there was a time when people did when he was in the hospital and tghey would rip out pages and he said that he felt rapped of his personal thoughts.please please please re-think about buying this if you are a true fan and if you want proof of how kurt felt about this then read the new newsweek with cobain on the cover.thanks
4,too short,"First of all, if you are looking at a peek into the life of Kurt Cobain, you're better off getting the excellent Heavier Than heaven. Journals offers an assortment of rants about rock journalists, a few drawings, and some letters that were already printed in HTH. For hardcore Nirvana fans it is an interesting read, but for anybody else it ain't much.And, it's way too short. I read it front to back in 2 hours."
3,Interesting,"I can't say that there is a lot in these journals that is eye-opening. If you are already a Nirvana fan you probably have read similar things Kurt Cobain has said that is in this volume. Most of his thoughts in this compilation are private, I suppose, but as a public figure we knew most of them already. But if you're a fan, you will want to get this."
3,Not Really,"I am a big Nirvana fan, I had concitered over the last year or so weather or not to buy Journals. So I bought a used copy. I know that Kurt would have not wanted his writings published, HOWEVER... Seeming that it has been so edited by Courtney, It hardley can be concitered Kurts private thoughts. More like words he once wrote and Courtney organized to how she saw fit. To Boycott Journals because of Courtney Love is one thing, But to do it because its ""raping"" Kurt is ludacrist, Courtney is the real Author of this book."
4,the cobain tradgedy,i like kurt and all but as a die hard Nirvana fan it really proves that kurt was a very small and scared little boy inside (not in a bad way though). The way he was so angry at people it makes it so easy for someone to make it seem as though he commited suicide! I personally think he did NOT commit suicide and that Mrs. Courtney Love (a.k.a. B****) DID kill him with heroin and a shotgun wound to his mouth. He couldn't have shot himself because it was a shotgun and he had on steel toe boots and he couldn't reach the trigger! It would be easy for Courtney Love to impersonate his handwriting and than create a website about it but only a handful of people are with me. They did find new evidence that he had heroin in his system BEFORE he was shot! Stand tall and think of the MURDER of Kurt Cobain.REVENGE ON KURT!
5,I can't wait to buy the next volume,"To quote a previous reviewer, ""I cringe at the idea of selling Kurt's thoughts""...Hypocrite. You sure didn't cringe when you bought his thoughts put to music, now did you? You've had to have bought his albums to love and appreciate Kurt as a musician, so you therefore had no issue with the selling of his thoughts then, now did you? He even encouraged people to read his thoughts in his journals (see his ""figure me out"" quote). He may or may not have meant this as sarcastic, but we'll never know. And since Kurt didn't destroy his journals before he died, he wanted SOMEONE to open them up for a good read. On the journals themselves: They're excellent. Kurt's a really interesting man with a penchant for clever writing. I Can't wait to buy the next volume."
1,Respect that should be paid to a true artist,"The idea of buying this book has created quite the inner dilemna. I found myself pausing when I passed by it in the book store. I am a huge Nirvana fan, and I do truly appreciate Kurt Cobain's genius and talent. However, I also appreciate him as a person, or, rather, the person he used to be. He was a private person, and the idea of selling his thoughts makes me cringe. So although I am intrigued by Kurt, I respect him just as much. If you were looking for a review of the book, then I'm not your girl. However, if you claim to be a true fan, consider what you'll be losing by reading this."
3,Broken Launcher,"No instructions except for a sticker on the launcher that says something to the effect of ""Remove this to use."" After disassembling the screws of the launcher only to discover that everything comes ready-to-go, I reassembled the launcher. My kids and I managed to get some good results until the hub/axle of the launcher snapped off."
1,How the hell does it work?,"No instructions, tons of little philips screws to unscrew, and we can't get it to stay on the launcher. A huge dud."
1,Not for Tivo,"Be careful- I was searching for the ST3750640SCE drive for my Tivo, and this is what I got. It is not the right drive if you are looking to add or replace to your Tivo drive. Dont make the same mistake as I did!"
1,You'll be sorry,"The first thing you'll notice when you unpack this drive is the improper grammar used on the packaging, which indicates the drive was made in China.The second thing you'll notice is the unusual machine marks on the side of the drive, reminiscent of a product slapped together in a third world country.Even without plugging the drive in, you know you're in trouble by this point. But you hope that you're not like everyone else whose written a bad review of the product (look at the other product links for the same product). Maybe I'll be different and mine will work.After you plug it in, it works and you breathe a sigh of relief. I did for all of 3 1/2 minutes. Then mine died. It won't power up again, either in the external drive case or the internal slot in my Dell.You'll be sorry if you buy this drive. You won't be different. You'll own a brick like the rest of us.Hey, but some people only learn by experience (myself included)."
1,"horrific drive - second replacement, and SLOW - avoid at all cost","This is now my second replacement drive, and once again the drive fails with a clicking sound, bringing down the entire computer. When removed from the SATA power connector, my Mac starts up perfectly.The first revision of this drive (an ""AAK"" firmware) was ridiculously slow - about 1/3 the speed of my Western Digital Caviar 750GB SATA drives. The replacement (""AAE"") firmware is faster, but still only 1/2 the speed of the WD drive.Now, with complete data loss, I'm over Seagate. (Read about their recent firmware issues on other drives...)AVOID like the plague!Return service, btw, is easy - and can be done online. For $20 you get an ""advanced replacement"" with free 2 day shipping and free return shipping. Not bad. I guess that Seagate must have this return system down to a science if the problems I've had are any indication."
2,Not what I expected...,"I thought Nad's was known for their ""NO HEAT"" method. However, its new bikini wax needs to be microwaved, and there are no strips. You need to wait for the wax to harden, then you have to peel the wax off as is. If this part was written in the item description, I would not have purchased the item. I was satisfied with the original Nad's wax (which I still LOVE). Would not recommend the new bikini wax...stick with the original!"
1,What a disaster,"I usually use the Surgi-Wax hard wax bikini wax, but thought I would give this product a try. Not only did it heat unevenly, so I had to wait for the whole tub to cool, but it didn't grip hair well and left a lot behind. Wax in the tub cooled very quickly, so by the end of the process it was globby and chunky. The only plus is that it came off easily with the included wipe. I definitely won't be using this product again. Stick to Surgi-Wax if you want a hard-wax bikini wax."
1,Hated it!,I have been useing wax for bikini and brazilians for a while. I hated this stuff. It heated unevenly and it didn't fully harden. It was like trying to pull sticky candy out of my hair. It didn't pull off right and didn't pull out all of the hair. It left big spots but it did take a few chunks out of my skin! I will never recommend this stuff to anyone I like!
4,The all new tenchi muyo,"hi my anme is nick i'm 11 and have recently gotten into manga i have aonly read bout 7 so far and I'm already obsessed I plan to continue reading them. This is the 4th manga i had read it was good with many entertaining elements such as action,romance and alot of witty humor displayed by lighthearted characters a very good solid start to the series I plan to purchase volume 2 shortly."
2,orbee ball,"I bought this ball because it said it was tough. The rope came off within 2 days. I tried to put another rope on it, but the dogs just don't like it.The rope comes thru the ball and this is knotted on top. The dog can get it's tooth stuck and the handle is not very long. I was very disappointed in the product. I would not buy this product again."
3,Nice Cheap Guitar with some drawbacks,"I bought this a few years ago. I would never pay more than $300 new or slightly used including a hardshell case.Pros: well built; the neck and fingerboard a nice for average-sized hands.Cons: the pickups feed back like you would not believe - I took one out and put in a noiseless tele pickup; a bit heavy for its size; the pickguard covers the entire front of the guitar and is made of flimsy ugly plastic (this is a pro when accessing the innards - like an access panel).With the new pickup, I used it for recording because I can't afford something better. It is easy to play and versatile - good for rock and roll, art rock, rockabilly, surf, even some metal."
1,Not the Masterpiece Movie!!!!,"This is NOT the movie of Al Capone with Rod Steiger which is one of the best gangster films of all time...This is a cheesy documentry with a small 5 second snipit from the original movie. That's how they get away with stating that Rod Steiger stars in the movie. I bought this too from a dollar store thinking I had found a great treasure. I only wish they would realease the real movie on DVD I would surely add it to my collection but,the real movie is only available on VHS. This is just a waste of time there's much better biographies out there on Al Capone. The title is misleading and I just don't want anymore people thinking they are buying a true classic of the silver screen and ending up with this stinker. E-nuff said 1 star."
1,Terrible,This is NOT the Al Capone movie starring Rod Steiger. just a bunch of people talking about Al Capone. a waste of time and money!
5,The ultimate role model,"At a time when most women stayed home and voted as their husbands advised, Eleanor Roosevelt was laying down the pathway for my generation. I work in the international democracy field and have sent this book to women in countries where their progress is far behind, in hopes that it will inspire them as it has renewed my own admiration for Eleanor,"
2,They work protect scrached but no fall protection.,"Buy this if you keep your phone in the pocket with keys or a pocketbook but 0% fall protection. So If you drop your phone with this on your phone...your phone will still break the glass on the front / hinges as if this wasn't on it at all. Also this case pops off when I dropped mine. ""you can tell I drop phones alot"""
2,"Buy for use, not for looks","The case is easy to snap on and seems protective enough--buy it for those reasons, if you buy it at all. If you bought your phone for aesthetic purposes and really value the appearance of the phone, just know that the case really cheapens the phone's appearance."
1,It should be cheap because it's made cheap.,I bought this to protect my phone and it only lasted about a week. After only normal wear and tear the cheap thin plastic was covered in cracks and started breaking apart. It was never even dropped. Finally I just took it off. Wouldn't recommend it...
2,Stick with Brown's later books,"Heard the taped version of Sondra Brown's RILEY IN THEMORNING . . . please be forewarned: this is NOT a currentBrown bestseller; rather, it is from her earlier period as aromance writer . . . the story involves a couple involved inthe production of a popular television program . . . for twopeople supposedly involved in the communications industry,I was amazed at their difficulties in relating to each other . . . also, I found the story quite predictable . . . only a few hot scenes managed to keep my attention . . . even the narration by Alison Fraser wasn't very good . . . she did fine on the male voices . . . however, her female voices were often shrill."
1,I almost couldn't make it through it!,"I always finish the books I read, because I am desperately hoping they will get better. This one got a little better, but not enough for me to warrant more than one star.It was almost painful to finish this one."
4,RILEY IN THE A.M. AND P.M.,"Readers know what to expect from Sandra Brown and she doesn't disappoint. Forty PLUS bestsellers are more than proof of her enduring popularity, as she continues to offer a melange of sex, love, wit, and entertainment.Riley In The Morning delivers again with its story of TV producer Brin Cassidy, who is hosting an all important party honoring network president Abel Winn. So, who appears at her door? The caterers? No. The florist? No. Her irresistibly handsome estranged husband Jon Riley, host of television's ""Riley In The Morning.""What a night that turns out to be!"
3,Audio Version,"I listened to this book on tape. As other reviews below state, it is about Riley and Brin, a couple separated that talk about past events throughout the story to get to the root of why Brin left Riley. I would much rather have read the book because the woman that read the story was too sugary for me even in scenes where Brin was mad. 'OHhhhhhhhhh Riley! Give me a break. I won't listen to any more tapes narrarated by that lady Alison. She ruined the story for me."
1,Audio book is terrible,"The actress who read this book uses inappropriate tone of voice throughout -- most of the time she's sticky sweet, even when the characters are angry or frustrated. She ruined the book for me. It's hard to rate the story when the reading was so off. Having said that, I don't think even with a good reading, the story would've held up. It could've been really good but it needs some massaging and editing in order to be there."
1,pretty bad,"I've only stopped listening to a few audiobooks ever and into the 3rd CD I killed it. Riley is not even likeable and all the story is....is descriptive detail of his hot body and sexy chest hair. There is no believeable chemistry whatsoever. Not one of Sandra Brown's good reads or listens.If you want to hear a good Sandra Brown book, check out Chill Factor!"
3,It could have been better,"I was really looking forward to reading this book because I haven't read many of Sandra's earlier books. Unfortunately, this book was kind of a let down. I did not connect with the characters. And I thought her reason for leaving Riley was kind of stupid. If they had talked it out right away, the seven month seperation would never have happened. I liked seeing how they met, that was sort of romantic, their whole history I mean. But in general it was not that good of a book. I have definitely read better. I would recommmend borrowing this book from a friend or renting it from your local library."
3,"Good book, but not a new title","This was a cute, short read, but BEWARE. This book was originally published in 1985. So, some readers may buy this book not realizing that they read it previously."
3,Too Predictable,I enjoy Sandra Brown and read many of her books but found this one highly predictable. I know that these books were originally published as Loveswept romances back in the early to mid-eighties and are just being released in hardcover so I wasn't expecting the usual suspense format. But 'In A Class By Itself' and this book have been let downs because after the first chapter you know why the character walked out on the man that they love and it usually isn't anything shocking or earth shattering. I'll continue to read these books I'll just have to make sure I kept my expectations low.
1,29 days - stylus stopped working,"Okay--this would be a great product . . . if it worked longer than 29 days!!!We were using this to help potty train my son. He ONLY used it sitting on the potty, so no abuse. Zero. None. Probably 15 minutes/day, max. My husband was with him when it ""broke."" One minute it worked, the next--nothing. I tried calling the help line. After several infuriating minutes of wading through inaccurate voice reponse menus (what color is your pen? Red? Blue? Purple? --uh, it's YELLOW!), I gave up after they asked for $5 to replace the pen. Excuse me?!!??? Back to Toys R Us tomorrow to see if they'll exchange it for me.They get the one (tiny, miserable) star because my son loved the product. Minus four stars from me. I'm tired of cheaply made kid's toys--that aren't cheap!! It's so disappointing to the children . . . and a lot more work for busy moms having to deal with poor customer service while trying to track down replacements."
1,Just read a book to your kid!,"We have an original My First Leap Pad, so maybe this one is better. My daughter has never been that interested in it, although she does bring me the book (without the device) to read to her. My advice? Don't use things like this to babysit your child -- buy a regular old book and sit down and read to her!"
3,"Great, but we've had problems with the cartridges!","My family and I have purchased Leap Frog products since my (now 4-year-old) son was born. The My First LeapPad has been the only product where I've kicked myself. Although the product is great and has entertained my son since he was about 2 1/2, we have had constant problems with the cartridges. Half the time (at least) we put them in, they say, ""Whoops! That's not a LeapPad cartridge!"" It happened a lot with the first one we purchased and, thinking it was a fluke since we've never had problems with Leap Frog products before, we exhanged it - about three months later (too late to return it) we had the same problem. We have bought about five or six of the books and the problem comes up with each one."
3,We loved it at first but the pen needed for operation broke right when the warranty was up!,"We do like this toy & I am (sigh) going to probably buy a new one if the replacement pen ($5) doesn't fix it because our kid really misses being able to use it but it is irritating that you go to the Leap pad website and you can see that stylus problems are clearly an issue for them & the warranty is pretty short (90 days) and if the problem reoccurs, I think the warranty on the fix it solution drops to 30 days, I guess so they dont have to keep sending you pens!"
4,Leapfrog My first LeapPad ABC School bus,"Purchased used, was in good condition overall a couple of scratches on the plastic and little tears on some of the books pages. Nothing really major, it'll most likely stay that way at least until my little boy breaks it :)"
1,Never worked,"Brand new, out of the box, brand new batteries and it won't turn on. After reading all the reviews here, I'm returning it for my money back. I'm guessing by the fact that they seem to break easily and one I bought never turned on that they are very poorly made. If its this delicate in a box during the shipping process, it'll never last in my house with two kids."
3,it's okay..,"my 4 yr old got the bus for Christmas and my 6 yr old got the LeapPad Read Aloud with microphone. My 4 yr old likes the regular LeapPad better than the My First LeapPad Alphabet Bus. Although she does enjoy the letters on the actual bus itself, the books are just so-so."
5,Great toy !!,"I contemplated buying this toy for my 3 1/2 year old daughter for christmas. Finally, on Christmas Eve, I decided to buy it for her. What a great decision that was. Out of about 30 christmas toys she received from everyone, this is by far her favorite. She plays with it every day. Would definitely recommend this toy to anyone."
3,No that great,"Mac is just another rich jerk with an inflated ego. He got rich by employing young pushy kids who won't leave you alone until you buy something or leave. If you decide to buy, his sales rats try to push you to not buy with cash, but instead apply for credit (with super high interest)from Gallery. This just lines Mac's pockets even thicker. What's the big secret? There's not one. He does sell quality furniture, but it's not cheap like his ads claim. His motto is ""Gallery Furniture Really Will Save You Money! I save myself money and a major headache by not shopping there anymore.By the way, Mac lost millions on bad investment deals like the Sam Houston Race Park. Then cried about it like a little girl.He's a sore loser in my opinion."
3,Misleading title,"In the introduction, the author states that ""the most effective range for this book is approximately a 150-mile radius of Pikes Peak."" and adds ""As you move to the four corners of the state and to the western slope, the book becomes less effective."" I wish I had known this before I purchased the book, because it lacks the information I needed to help identify plants on the western slope of Colorado. However, if you live in the defined area, I'm sure you will find it useful. The drawings are beautifully done, the descriptions are adequate, and the appendices are well-done."
1,worthless,This worthless book follows some arcane numbering system that could only be valuable to a computer programer. The descriptions are aimless and do not seem to match anything in nature
3,Batteries are not Nikon brand!,"This is a useful product, but prospective purchasers should be aware that although the description says that all three items carry ""Nikon USA warranty"", the batteries are not Nikon brand. This means that the combo is not the extraordinary value that it appears to be!"
2,Marred by factual and spelling errors,"The concept of the book is fine, but there are a number of factual errors and misspellings. For example, the book refers to a view of ""Los Padres National Park"". If the authors don't know the difference between a national forest and national park, one wonders what else they did'nt know in writing the book."
2,Bought it for the cover,"Even I have my shallow moments, and this was one of them. You can't judge a book by its cover, but you sure as hell can buy one because of it; in fact most publishers count on it. And I know, this is a completely useless review, but there you have it."
3,"Please be advised - this book is in German, not English","Book is not written in English but is in German, not immediately noted on website."
4,"Quality Paper at a ""Quantity Price""","I bought this paper to go with a binder that my son needed for an English class. It was mandatory for him to have a binder and I needed to find some paper to fit in it that was going to last.This is a nice thicker feel paper. It is lined, college ruled paper and can be written on and erased over and over again without worrying about putting any holes in your projects through this paper. Much nicer than any I've found at a ""staples store, drug store...etc.""Plus amazon makes it quite easy to find binders and fillers and everything else you need all right here and they ship them together so you get them quick as can be. You can't go wrong at this price.It's a great deal. I've bought several packages and will buy several more. : )"
2,Cute Pants But!!!,Pants labeled as women's but sizing was incorrect 2 sizes too small. I ordered a 9/10 but it was more like a size 6. It will be going back. I think they are sized for juniors.
4,Great Book,"This is a great book though i read it in 2005, 15 years after its publishing!!! A great futuristic reading"
5,Excellent Book,"All of Toffler's books are amazing. I can't say enough good things about them. Those who do not like his books are clearly just those types who hate anything that becomes too popular. Someone should explane to them that just because something is well-liked doesn't mean it suddenly lacks value. Toffler has predicted so much that has become true. His great ability to use social science to show us the future is beyond impressive. Future Shock, The Third Wave, and Powershift. Read all three."
3,"Not bad, the text is a teasure hunt for meaning...","The text has much to offer. I think Toffler has made some very important points that everyone can find use of in some sense or other. The fundamental criticism I have -- if I must offer one -- is that regardless of Toffler's having been an English major in University, and a pro writer I find his writing style clumsy and near unintelligible. Toffler's writing is difficult to follow, disorganised, and he uses many terms to decorate his views that merely confuse rather than intrigue the reader. If Toffler could learn to write clear and concise prose, he would be twice as popular as he already is. Good read nonetheless..."
3,so disappointed,"Received set in record time, kudos for that, unfortunately that's the only good thing about this flatware set. It was suprisingly flimsy, the whole service set bent easily. The pattern was not did not match up with the frosted part of the finish. (like it was painted outside the lines) I could have lived with that, but the spoons all had rough cut edges, I only ran my finger over them, but they were sharp enough to never want to put them near my mouth. I was really looking forward to this set, but they definitely are going back."
3,beginning to rust,"I got 2 of these sets for Thanksgiving and now I am beginning to see rust spots, mostly on the knives but the others too. I don't use Lemon anything (I hate lemons and the smell makes me sick) I thought maybe it was the diswasher even though it said they are diswasher safe. I took a couple ones we had set aside and did a test on them and only wahsed them by hand. The same thing, it is beginning to rust. In searching around somone mentioned scrubbing out the rust spots with a magic eraser so nest time I am at the store I will have to pick one up to try. Otherwise it is a good set, I love the design and my husband loves the weight to them."
2,Rusts and Stains,"I bought 3 of these sets 10 months ago. They are all rusting and staining in different places. I am so disappointed. I use a dishwasher regularly, and the flatware does not get used excessively. It's almost as if the plating isn't thick enough or something. I'm going to replace the sets, but I feel very ripped off. I didn't keep the receipts, and so now I'm stuck."
5,one of my all time favorites,"i think that dvd is overpriced but as for the story, it is one of the best that i've ever seen. as far as i know, CLAMP never lets most of their characters kiss and i must admit that in all of the romance (you're blind if you cannot see the romance in this story because why would Syaoran go through the trouble of collecting her memories if he's not in love with her?) animes that i've seen, the series created by CLAMP are the only ones I have not seen the characters kiss. And the love story is just bittersweet. Syaoran's beloved is within his arms' reach but he cannot grab her because she has would never, ever remember what their relationship was like before she lost her memories. It's one of those cliches, yes, but a cliche with a twist (get it?). I'm a little disappointed that the anime never got to the best parts in manga, but still, a best anime is the best"
5,really cool anime,"how many different people from other books and anime can come together and make one show. it is interesting how sakura and syaoran are drawn as teenagers. my only complaint is can they have drawn there legs any longer or made them any skinnier. their bodies seemed a little off. the story , music and art work are wonderful. enjoy doing the i remember that person from --------- show or book."
4,It's OK....,"I brought this series after watching xxxHoltic and really liking it. I was a bit let down though. I can understand the reason for the series being set up the way it was and a search for the pieces of a person's soul thru many worlds is a good story idea, but... This only works if the series and any additional series have an ending in mind and not just a greedy person looking for a power and manipulating the heroes. The first series isn't all that bad, but it sets of a ""never ending"" search idea which I had trouble with. At least a search needs a certain goal. Like, let's say, how many feathers are in her soul, or maybe more about when the search reaches an end. You get some of this but not enough. Plus you don't get enough on the villians either. I generally like the series and the adventures were great enough. You get a cliff hanger ending with no firm idea of how much is ahead and this is bit of a let down to me."
2,Buy the Corded Model,I have the full set of Bosch 18V Cordless tools and am very happy with them. However this unit was a major disappointment. It burned out after very little use. I have the Corded Bosch Jigsaw and it is a much better tool.
1,Burned out two of them,"My first one failed and I assumed it was just a fluke since my other Bosch cordless tools are very reliable, so I ordered another one. The second one burned out after about 2 hours of intermittent use.Very disappointing that Bosch continues to sell these."
2,burned after about one hour use,The motor got burned after about one hour use. I hope to not have the same problem as I have the whole fleet of cordless tools. Only the jig saw had a problem. It's so usefull for me I bought another one. I'll see.The second one got burned as well. Don't buy it. Don't. Buy the corde one.
2,Another burnout,"It worked well until it burned out with very little usage--perhaps one hour. A very expensive hour at $145 plus a very expensive battery, which is now of no use."
1,Loosing confidence with BOSCH,"The motor on my saw burnt after little use. Great saw while it lasted, but at a high price. Trying to bring awareness to BOSCH that it's time for a safety recall. If you experience a similar problem, please let BOSCH know."
1,A PATHETIC TRAVESTY!!!,"Unlike Donaldson's first ""Chronicles"" trilogy (arguably one of the finest epic fantasys ever written), this pretentious attempt at hard-boiled detective fiction is inauthentic, tiresome, and a complete waste of the reader's time. I got my copy for free, and I still feel cheated! If you want to read something worthwhile in this genre, check out something by Raymond Chandler, Andrew Vachss, or David Cray -- even the worst mass-market fluff by that hack Robert Parker is far better than this travesty! Have you no shame, Mister Donaldson?"
4,Great Unknown Band,"I had never heard of this band, until I went to links on Against Me!'s site. I saw No Idea Records, and i must say that this band is a great example of where folk can be rock. And a band doesn't have to be angry to rock. The leads singer has a great voice. I'm surprised she hasn't been signed to a bigger label yet. If you like this, I recommend listening to a band called ""Defiance, Ohio"" also"
3,Good history of the El Captain,"This book helped me to understand, that this train was and should still be to American transport."
1,Not What You Think,"This is NOT The Message by Eugene Peterson. I mistakenly purchased this, and boy was I surprised. It should not be in the Bible section, but because the author has chosen the same name as Peterson's paraphrase of the entire Bible, it comes up. Do NOT purchase this if you are looking for Peterson's The Message."
1,blah!!!!!!!!!!,The earrring seems pretty but there are different color stones in some places random colors like green and dark blue!!!!!!! IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!!!!It is smaller than it seems..........way smaller!!!!! DO NOT BUY! most earrings from this seller are TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!
2,very disappointed in this one,"I'd like to advise anyone checking out this book to save their money. I didn't find anything here I haven't seen in many other general books on discipline. Here's what I learned from this book:If your child is bipolar, life will be difficult. Resign yourself.This is probably true, but it wasn't worth $20 to me to be told something I already know."
3,"Right size, terrible quality","I knew it was recycled paper and everything, but this seemed like the recycled paper I used as a kid. You know the kind that tore when you used an eraser on it. And the glue that holds the paper onto the pad is really flimsy, so the cardboard comes off almost immediately. I needed this size to fill a crayon lap desk for my daughter, but these are a huge disappointment."
2,Flimsy backing,"These were very disappointing scratch pads. The cardboard backing for the pad is quite flimsy making them difficult to use. On the other hand, although the paper isn't very white, inks don't seem to run on it."
2,Scratch Pad Dilema,"It can be difficult with finding a 5x7 pad in a local store, Thought I would ""think Green"" with buying these pad's made from recycled materials. The paper material is 'weak', rips too easy. The GLUE TOP is also shabby, cardboard backing came off two pads rite away and am afraid, this glue top does not hold the paper sheets as expected. Next time, I will spend the extra buck's and purchase ""real"" scratch pad's."
1,product not received,how can you expect to get a review from me...when its been a month since i ordered the product...this really is very poor quality service...you should ask me how i review amazon.com..........and here i can help you easily.....one out of ten...for appalling service....louis phillips
1,totally boring movie,This almost seemed like a silent film. It was just so terrible and boring that I finally just shut it off not wanting to waste any more time.worthless
2,Overrated,"I thought this tape would be great like most Richard Scary movies- boy was I wrong. It's tolerable, but very dated, silly, changes the story lines (3 little pigs don't get eaten) and has silly, fake european accents (German and Swedish. This tape should be maybe 2$, not 8$ or 9$."
1,The Only Toilet that Cannot be Plunged!,"Because of the weird bowel opening at the bottom of the bowl this toilet cannot be plunged. It took forty minutes, no joke, to unlcog this toilet after it stopped up. I literally got a workout doing it and I suppose the clogged up toilet paper eventually brokedown and allowed the toilet to flush.I called Kohler about this and they said it's a known issue, yet they were not smart enough to fix it. The new Cimarron and similar models have the very same issue. Kohler suggested a special type of plunger which we bought and paid extra money for yet it also could not plunge the toilet. Aside from this whenever anything gets caught on the sides of the bowel, it will not flush because of the way the toilet is designed.We are getting rid of this toilet and I cannot wait to flush this toilet in a dumpster--goodbye Kohler!"
1,regret to say,This CD music arrangements and sound are nothing like Barbara's rendition. Regret to be negative.
5,Sharing Special Times,I am very pleased with the sticker album. It is by far one of the cheapest 'toys' that my 2 year old son has and his and my absolute favorite. It has really brought us closer together. He gets stickers as rewards and we enjoy sitting down and adding them to his book. Later we like to review the book and discuss where the stickers came from and what he did to deserve them. Often times we make up stories as we look at all of his special stickers. It's great not having to worry about him sticking him on the furniture and toys anymore. This book is awesome! Thank you so much.
3,A good start,"I waited for a chance to use this book before writing a review. For the past two years, I use it only when I need words to describe to the lay person ""What"" System Architecting is. But for practical system architecting technique, this book won't get it for you."
5,good product and good service,The book is in a very good style and also the service is good. I sent an email and got reply very quickly.

5,Awesome,"This movie was awesome, I was actually in Kelsey Keel's class in eighth grade and she is as sweet in real life. I love this movie and would reccomend it to anyone!"
3,A cute family movie,"Although I have not seen this movie on the DVD format, I can say I saw it on VHS, and it's a clean wholesome family movie of a girl coming of age story in the south during the 50's. The story focuses on the family itself and the growing pains of a girl with no siblings.(Taken from VHS cover....Based on the award winning book, ""My Louisiana Sky"" is a heartfelt portrait of one girl's emotional journey to a place she'd always dreamed of and the road back home.)I rated it three stars cause I grew up with brothers, and there was little for me to relate to in this movie, Its a family kind of Hallmark film. I don't know if the movie has a rating, but its a definite G rating movie. Its kind of in the genre of ""Old Yeller"" by Disney."
5,Remember this in the corner grocery store?,"Some memories of childhood are delightful. This one is--The candy jar that sat on the counter near the cash register (yes, back in the day) and if you had a couple of pennies, you plopped them on the counter to pay for a reach into the candy jar for your turn of sugary delights.Now I want one for my kitchen counter for my Pretend Children. I think they will love it!! But first I must investigate what their favorites are."
2,candy jar,This is not worth the price I paid. It looks and feels cheap. Wish I had bought a glass jar.
3,Great watch.. finish rubbed off,"Great watch.. large face, looks impressive on a mans wrist. The finish did rub off on the back of the watch near the clasp."
5,"A must for teachers, professionals, or anyone who speaks!","As a part-time instructor at a two-year college, I found this book very helpful. Knowing your content is not enough when you are teaching or speaking to colleagues. Irritating physical or vocal mannerisms can turn your audience off. Read this book and learn how to correct these small but critical errors in your delivery and you're sure to engage your audience on a new, deeper level.I was fortunate enough to hear Dr. Hillman speak. If you get the opportunity, don't miss him! He is dynamic and inspirational!"
5,a beautful lady a beautiful story,it was with trepidation that i bought this book in the first place.But being a skeeter fan i had to check it out.Am so glad i did .what a wonderfull and moving story of one of the great icons of country mucic.the reader is taken on a journy through the life and times of this lady and we get to see and feel how she lived.
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't finish this book, which is something I generally strive to do. The book gives the impression you're reading about the author, rather than Orwell, every page exudes authorial arrogance with constant subjective views, which some may find interesting, however that is not why I read a biography."
4,Orwell biography,"I ordered this for one of my students, so I appreciated the prompt shipment and the condition of the product. Thank you."
2,"Author not focused, doesn't admire Orwell","This is one of those catch-all biographies that attempts to throw in everything including the kitchen sink and fails in all regards. The author, D. J. Taylor attempts to connect Orwell's writings with his life but spends so much time on trying to find little kernels of truth in the authors mundane diary entries that he accomplishes almost nothing. Since Taylor has no ability to write critically about Orwell's works he should have focused on the details of Orwell's life which are easier to record. Also one gets the feeling that Taylor isn't a fan of Orwell's writing and has little simpathy for his weaknesses in character. So why write the book?"
1,Unsafe,"After typing this review, I am going to spend the next 30 minutes trying to get blood out of my carpet. My 6 year old somehow toppled this gate and ended up with a bloody nose - it's a remarkably heavy gate. Yesterday we installed the gate, and it fell on my 3 year old as she tried to ""pull up"" the door to open it (which is required in order to swing open the door). Thank goodness it didn't fall on my 10 month old! We chose this gate because we needed something our two other children could open and close. Not only could my 3 not open it (it was too complicated), I had trouble lifting the door - it usually took two hands.... So, after cleaning up the blood on the carpet, I'll be throwing this hunk of junk back into the box to return to the store tomorrow."
2,Review of Advertising to Baby Boomers,"Since I market to the Baby Boomers, I thought this would be a good book to have.What I found, however, were mostly war stories about big advertising agencies challenges to marketing to the Boomer generation. For me, a tedious read and not a lot of useful information I didn't already know."
4,"The name is Pitt, Dirk Pitt","Okay I watched the movie Sahara, based on the Clive Cussler, Dirk Pitt novel. Movie wasn't all that great, but I figured the book must be good if they were willing to make a movie about the character.Well I started at the begining of the Dirk Pitt adventure series and I haven't been dissappointed. They just keep getting better.Vixen 03 is the fifth book in the series. Once again we find our NUMA special projects leader diving in over his head. From a South African civil war brewing, to a plague capable of wiping out entire civilizations, and an attack on the nation's capital this book keeps you rocketing foward. Pitt's Sherlock Holmes mind, his way with the ladies, and his overwhelming desire to solve any problem he is faced with gives you a real page turner character. Fans of his side-kick Giordino will once again enjoy his unwaivering loyalty and his quick one-liners."
3,I bought this book by mistake. Thought it was a new book.,"I do like Clive Cussler a lot. Being a pilot, a scuba diver, and a nerd his books fit my just fine. Like the Hardy Boys when I was a kid."
3,It was OK,"First off, I am an avid reader. I have read six Cussler Pitt novels. I like this one the least. First, there is an absence of Al, Pitt's sidekick. Second, the Admiral plays a more significant part. Third, it forgets to finish the side story. I thought this book was just Okay."
4,More character... less pitt grandstand,"This one seemed to be less surface with Dirk, more about what drives him, less of Dirk keeping all the secrets til the end of the book where he shows the villain how he knew all along (which I didn't really mind--I love Pitt's notorious witt and ego). He had more depth in this book, maybe because it involved a woman throughout instead of in periphery. I did feel that the book, in general, flowed a bit less smooth than the previous few, but Cussler did spend much more time than usual in the eyes of other characters, and that could be why. Overall, a solid read--highlighted with a couple very nice copter scenes."
2,Worst of Clive Cussler,I didnt like this book at all if I compare the other books that Clive Cussler has written. It is a lack of adventure.I can easily say that this is Clive Cussler's worst book
2,I don't know if this was the usual Cussler fare.,"When I started Vixen03, I thought I'd get some oldtime, classic Clive. Instead, after reading about 200 pages of it, I wasn't so sure what I was reading. Sure Dirk gets it on with Loren, drives his old car around, and fights off some old geezers, but it wasn't the same. The transition between Africa and the American parts left me wondering what was going on. oooo, the psychosamatic white guy living in Africa whose family was torched was really disturbed. So what. I'd read 10 pages and still be back at square one. Who really cares about what the stupid African kingpin was doing anyway? It didn't even say if he was involved! In conclusion, Vixen 03 was probably the boringest Pitt novel I've read."
5,Icy,This was the first Clive Cussler novel I read and I remember feeling icy chills as I read about Dirk Pitt diving in the freezing lake. Excellent writing!
2,The dullest of the Dirk Pitt novels.,"Having read most of the Dirk Pitt Novels to date, I have to say that Vixen 03 was the least enthralling.Maybe because it is the most plausible or perhaps most mundane of Cussler's Pitt scenarios, It reads almost like a typical young adult novel of low caliber action."
4,Dirk to the rescue,Biological weapons are buried in a lake and the race is on to see who will get them first. More diving by Pitt and the NUMA team as they uncover mystery in the deep.
4,Adorable,This darling little fox will be the perfect gift decoration for a baby shower package (although it's not meant for the baby). Better than the early fox Beanie Babies and just the right size for a shelf decoration later.
2,Plush Fannie Fox Mini cute,If you want a small plush FOX this is the one. When we received the item it was too small for our plans and had to be returned. Just to small but cute.
1,hiss and interference,"This amplifier sounds good, except for the problem of background hiss and some sort of radio interference.The hiss is persistent and audible with every headphone i've tried, and the radio interference is very bad- the noise changes pitch and loudness depending on the orientation of the amplifier."
4,a definitive deconstruction of modern society,"I cannot say that I have enjoyed any rant book more than I have this one. These 2 authors skillfully mix wit, intelligence, comedy, and truth covering nearly every facet of modern society. This book is a slap in the face wake up call to all of humanity, while only having a small amount of pompous mewling. It's about time we start respecting ourselves, rather than living by a moral guideline that was created by the media to induce the greatest profit from the masses. Well done."
5,Great vitamins,I've been taking VM-2000 for years. Great vitamins. Large pills (ugh!). Fantastic to keep me healthy. I recommend these to anyone.
1,Makes me tired instead of giving me energy,"I couldn't figure out why I was so tired, but after taking even a small amount of this vitamin formula I was tired all the time. I replaced it with another formula and I felt fine. Tried this formula 2000 again and the same result, sleepy and tired."
2,Trim not bookcase,When i first saw this product i wondered why it was so cheap. It wasn't until after i received it that i realized it was a trimming for the bookcase rather then the actual bookcase itself. I was very surprised and don't know what to do with the trimming. I'm stuck trying to figure out if i need a bookcase after all anymore.
3,picture please,"I bought Tropic Cooking for my Grandaughter that wanted to learn to cook fish like she has had on cruises. The recipes look great but has no pictures of the dishes. Kids are inspired by pictures, then taste. I will keep looking for tasty photographs."
1,"This ""book"" is utter trash!",It is a sad day when a pile of trash such as this is considered a book. This is more a work of fiction than a true account of the life of Evita.
4,"Argintine friends say this is the ""real"" Evita",A friend just bought this paperback in a UK bookstore. Our Argentine expatriate friends say it describes the life of Eva Peron without the glamour and hype
5,Great for travel and tough construction,We use this almost every trip with our Shih-tzu. She loves it and has plenty of room for her. Holds up really well in the 10 trips we have used it.
2,A DRIVE-IN T & A ACTION MOVIE,"This movie is really not worth the time and effort for a movie review . I fast forwarded through most of the it . It's a pretty cheesey run of the mill low budget T & A action flick . We bought the VHS video tape hoping to see if the cute and busty former adult film star Kascha had any real acting ability . To be polite, I would say she could use a few acting lessons from Paris Hilton . Kascha's scenes are few and minor and she doesn't quite make it to the end of the movie I'm afraid .My biggest complaint is not with the movie but with the cheap, low quality VHS video tape . They recorded it at the slowest SLP speed instead of the SP speed that you would expect to receive when you purchase a pre-recorded video . In order to save a few pennies they made an awful movie even less watchable . The picture quality is poor and you can forget about freeze-framing any worthwhile scenes . This cheap video tape you would expect to find at your local 99 cents store ."
1,Not too interesting....,"This video starts off with a typical american voice trying to make an impression on the viewer and almost gets away with it. But from that point most of the content was boring. John was out for revenge, Jennifer wants his love and the paramilitairy group get what they deserve. A video that is only worth watching between 2 and 4 in the morning when nothing else is on the TV."
1,Defective item!,Experience so far has been a huge letdown. Reason being shoddiness of product: No content. CD is blank. Must be a production error. Have contacted Sony Music with a view of obtaining a replacement from them.
2,Not the best. Over simplistic.,"The authors seem to be pro biotech industry. I found it disturbing that they could so confidently write that Genetically Modiefied foods are safe to eat. Even when they present evidence from scientific studies that say otherwise, they still come right back and say the we should not be alarmed in eating these foods. The authors have an over-simplistic sheep-mentality viewpoint. There were some erroneous information presented in their GM foods historical timeline."
2,Softwalk,The main problem is that the strap cut into the top of my foot and also created blisters on my toes. I had to return it.
3,My first mail order for shoes,"These Softwalk Women's La Fon Mary Jane shoes were new and packaged well. I received them in a timely manner. I have feet that are hard to please with neuromas and bones that make shoes hard to fit comfortably. I had tried these shoes on in a store and they fit very comfortably. However, when I received these shoes they were too tight and hurt my foot on the side of the strap. I am searching for a comfortable dress shoe and I was a bit disappointed in the La Fon Mary Jane."
5,"The ""Soft Stuff"" Said Quite Well","As a ""pragmatic"" left-brainer, high-testosterone male most of my life, I discovered my creative and feminine side and that has made all the difference in the world. Aleta's philosophies, practices and techniques might have been considered ""soft"" by me in the past, but she beautifully helps the reader understand and ""frame"" the great VALUE of embracing the very things to help us reduce stress, rejuvenate our lives, dust off our dreams and move toward the beckoning light of our inner greatness just over the horizon. Get this book and don't just read it. Absorb it and live it! You rock, girl!Ray AnthonyPresidentAnthony Innovation GroupThe Woodlands, TX"
3,A simple novelization....,"The last story arch of the Third Doctor is one of the best. I like stories with alien planets, spiders, Buddhism and Sarah Jane Smith. But the novelization of the story is not as good as it can be. Instead of expanding on things Mr. Dicks takes away from it. Details are washed away, dialogue is simplified, and nothing is described. The humor and the sense of danger has been removed from the whole story."
3,Purely for die-hards,"I absolutely ADORE this band but even I found it quite hard to sit through. As others have commented, it is very dated, but I suppose it was a cool concept for it's time. The only part I really liked was ""the making of Arena"" portion of the DVD, and even then, I was still fast-forwarding through to see the parts where band members were interviewed. I think that is it's only saving grace. There were definitely some ""Spinal Tap"" moments, particularly when Nick was talking about how he constructed his own costume for the Wild Boys video, that really cracked me up. Otherwise, the acutal Arena video/concert portion was a total drag. I would have just preferred to see the concert itself without the alien snippet interruptions.It is definitely entertaining to see how young the bandmembers looked back then when they do the behind-the-scenes interviews. Like I said, this is purely for die-hard Duranies."
3,Duran Duran - 'Arena:The Movie/Making Of Arena' (EMI)DVD,"I saw Duran Duran on this very tour,in early 1984 and one thing I remember was that it was one of the first concerts that had a ticket cost of $15.How things have changed.The live performance on this DVD is good.High quality sound,picture and cinematography through out.THAT said,there is far too many snippets/interruptions with the lame-ass sci-fi scenes of the mutated aliens making their way through the concert trail(or whatever).A little would've been okay,but this much is downright annoying.Believe that much of this DVD was the same concert that aired on MTV and maybe one other channel in the '80's by the title 'As The Lights Go Down'.Some of the classics I somewhat enjoyed experiencing once again were ""Is There Something I Should Know?"",""Girls On Film"",""Hungry Like The Wolf""(my Duran Duran favorite),""Save A Prayer"" and ""Union Of The Snake"".Even die-hards MAY not get that excited about this release."
3,arena,"ok, if your a hardcore fan,like me, your gonna get it anyway. - but i never liked this. not as a vhs or dvd. its just kind of corny. definetly very dated. i mean, im sure the idea behind it was meant well but everytime you get into a song its interupted by midgets or retarded aliens or just some other nonsense. the only thing i enjoyed about this was the making of arena-because it included some interviews with the band. so go with sing blue silver. thats a much better dvd."
3,COOL BUT WE WANT AS THE LIGHTS GO DOWN ON DVD,"THIS IS A FUNNY ,ABSURD TWIST OF A D2 SHOW (MAD MAX MEETS DURAN)...NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!!!IT'S GREAT TO FINALLY HAVE SOME DVDS OF THE BIGGEST POP PHENOMENON OF THE EIGHTIES BUT SINCE THE MUSIC OF DURAN DURAN AGED SO WELL AND IS STILL (GET MORE RECENT CDS) DEFINITELY SOME OF THE BEST TO COME OUT OF ENGLAND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO DO THEM JUSTICE BY RELEASING A DVD WITH A FULL CONCERT OF THEIR HEYDAYS (AS THE LIGHTS GO DOWN & WORKING FOR THE SKIN TRADE ARE 2 INCREDIBLE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES)...GOOD NEWS,I HEARD THEY WOULD BE RELEASING SOON A DVD OF THEIR REUNION TOUR LIVE AT WEMBLEY ARENA 2004 !!!DURAN DURAN HAD A STRONG IMAGE BUT TO MOST OF THEIR FANS MUSIC WAS THE STRONGEST SIDE OF D2 AND THIS IS WHAT WE STILL WANT THE MOST....SO HOW ABOUT A SPECIAL DVD SET INCLUDING ""REAL"" SHOWS OF THE PAST AND PRESENT???THE FAB 5 (4,3) DESERVE IT AND THE FANS TOO....OK,,,HAIL TO THE BEATLES OF THE EIGHTIES AND ROLLING STONES OF THE NEW MILLENIUM!!!"
2,An absurd notion...indeed,"Sadly that part of the title is just a hint of things to come. I don't know what the hardcore Duran Duran fan will make of this DVD, but I was very disappointed. I expected this release to be a full, uninterrupted concert of some of their best songs. At least that's what it looks like reading the back of packaging. Instead you get 2/3 music along with stupid vignettes of aliens running around the building. DURING the songs. Not just one song, but every song performed during the concert drops out so we can see rejects from Star Wars running around behind the scenes. I guess the person who directed 'Thriller' decided to bring the production to a live concert. This was very annoying. You only get one full, uninterrupted track, 'Save A Prayer' in the bonus section of the DVD. Hardly what I would want to pay $30 for. This gets 2 stars for good picture and sound quality. Strong recommendation to avoid. I am taking this back ASAP."
4,An Absurd Notion,"The subtitle of this movie is clearly ""An Absurd Notion,"" so those of you looking for a serious concert film can't complain that you don't like it. It's a goofy, ridiculous mash-up of a bad sci-fi flick (Barbarella, mainly, the source of the band's name) and a concert film. It is pretty ridiculous from start to finish. But it is a lot of fun, and the band look and sound great.If you want a serious concert film from this era, get ""As the Lights Go Down."" If you want bizarro fun with Duran Duran songs in it, get Arena."
4,Great Concert,"Yes, the added aliens are very annoying, but I had to buy this as I was at the concert myself. This was filmed at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, CA on Thursday and Friday April 12th and 13th 1984. The Ticket price for this general admission concert was actually $14, but was over the $15 mark with the service charge. Those were the days....."
3,Great start and very clever But...,"I loved the characters of this book. The story took off right away. She is a gifted writer and very witty. Great dialog until we enter the ""let's break up the couple once before the end of the book"". Enter a hokey vision she has about her future daughter and then they split up. I was disapointed and almost just quit reading. It did not fit with the rest of the story. I felt like her editor had called and said ""Finish this book!"" I loved her last book. This one didn't quite live up to the promise of her first."
4,The Whirlwind Wedding,"Austin, Ninth Duke of Bradford is hiding a family secret; he is being blackmailed about his dead brother. Elizabeth Matthews, an American, whose secret ability to see visions, is determined to help Austin at any cost. Even her life! I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and will be looking forward to more of Jacquie D'Alessandro's books. This was the first one I had read of her, and it was in my favorite Regency time period!! Marilyn, The Regency Lover's Cafe"
4,Another great read from Jacquie D'Allessandro!,"This is yet again another fantastic read from Jacquie D'Allessandro. I couldn't help but fall in love with Austin and Elizabeth and the fantastic secondary characters that help this story along. This story had just the right balance of internal and external conflicts, which were resolved without any drawn out, long misunderstandings (a rarity in regency romance!!) A lighthearted, sexy, sometimes humorous, always well-written novel, that I would recommend without hesitation."
5,awesome price and deal.,I bought this I didn't like the green on the cover then I found out that it has two sides so it can be switched with a regular version. I have wanted to watch this series and I love it comes with the OVA so it was worth the price I payed. If you like girls piloting giant mechs than you will love this series.
3,Parenting in Contemporary Society,"I'm using this for my Child Development Class, Urban Families: Contemporary Issues. I think its useful"
2,One Must Really Like Joan Baez,"I bought this albumn before I learned how to burn CDs ... Because really the only song I desired was/is ""Diamonds & Rust"". It is a beautiful ode to her ex.I haven't been inclined to listen to the remainder of the albumn, mostly because I can only take so much of Ms. Baez's voice ... Especially her renditions of Bob Dylan's ""Simple Twist of Fate"", and John Prine's ""Hello in There"".One shall be much more rewarded to obtain these two songs in particular by the original artists."
2,Pretty but boring,Joan Baez has a very pretty voice but she sings without intensity or conviction. She lacks depth. This is not an album you return to again and again. After you've heard it a couple of times there's no reason to listen to it again.
1,Far from Baez's greatest folk material!,"Despite many positive recommendations of this album, I do not like the material, the singing and the accompaniment. As a folk aficionado, I prefer Baez's true folk singing, especially when she accompanies herself on the guitar. There she really shines. Her contemporary material lacks the power and beauty of her earlier folk singing."
5,"It's the voice, it's the voice!","Having spent many hours decades ago thrilling to the pure tones of the Baez voice, it was wonderful to discover it in full bloom on this CD. Some of the songs are intensely personal, and the title song is beautiful, sad and moving. If you like Baez you will love this."
5,Depressing in Lovely Way,I got this old favorite as a download after wearing out the LP. Haunting as ever. Did I really listen to this over and over without spending time in the dumps?
5,This is as good as it gets!,I had this recording in an LP years ago and now I have the CD. It's wonderful music and has lots of good mixes and I would buy it all over again if need be. It's music I can sing along with and I do just that.Happy I bought it.
3,"Wrong, wrong, wrong","The reviewer who says that Baez lack ""depth and conviction"" couldn't possibly have missed the point any more thoroughly. Joan has enough depth and conviction to float a battleship; what she lacks, here and elsewhere, is the absolutely flawless ear that has made Bob Dylan a great artist in spite of being a contemptible human being.Baez, on the other hand, seems to be an enchanting human being, and her voice is one of the great instruments of our time, and 'Diamonds and Rust' is one of the most moving love songs I've ever heard. The rest of the album clinks and clanks and clunks, because she isn't ""so good with words, and at keeping things vague..."" Which may be part of what makes her such a good person. Never mind. She's earned her keep with Diamonds and Rust, and Joe Hill and her cover of Jagger/Richards Salt of the Earth, and a hundred other songs she has brought to life with her magnificent voice and her unbelievable decency. God bless you, Joan."
2,One hit and ten duds.,"Liked ""Diamonds and Rust', the rest were not the Joan Baez of the 60's, which I will always remember. Wish there was a complete remastered CD of Joan's old original best selections recorded in studio. The folk period was for a very short time and many of us are getting older now and want to just remember the way it was, not mix it up with songs from artist that have changed their style, just to try and keep up with the times. Rick Nelson's ""Garden Party"" tells of people like me, who just want to hear the old stuff and have it sung just like it was recorded. After all, that is what made it great in the first place."
5,Wonderful!,"My mother was recently diagnosed with brain cancer. I bought this book for her thinking there would be some practical things within in which she might find helpful. It is all that AND MORE! Mom says the book has given her a completely new attitude towards her cancer. She now feels SHE is in control and can deal with whatever may come. I highly recommend this book for ANY cancer patient, but especially those newly diagnosed with the disease."
2,cancer 50 things,Not worth the cheap price I paid. Other than one idea the rest is devoid of new thought
5,This book gave my husband his fight back.,"My 37 yr old husband has stage 4 esophageal cancer. After his diagnosis, we lived through three months of hell, with our 1 year old daughter. Then, we were given this book. It changed our lives. We decided he just wasn't going to die, and we could no longer go on living as if he was. Granted this book discusses & prefers non-conventional treatments, but the message of HOPE it gives is undeniable. We radically changed our diet, then my husband did 7 months of chemo, we had a couple nice months of remission, then he had his esophagus and 1/3 of his stomach removed and is now undergoing radiation. He should be very dead by now according to the doctors. If there is one book to read after a cancer diagnosis - THIS is the book."
5,Critical and Uplifting Information,This book provides very good information for anyone who has been diagnosed with cancer or going thru the process now. I use it as my daily and uplifting reminder as I do my bible. FABULOUS Book! I would highly recommend it..
2,Not what I expected.,"Definitely not what I expected. More of an emphasis on alternative treatments & the mind/body connection. Some info on vitamins.The author makes it VERY clear he is STRONGLY against conventional treatment and makes it sound like something from the Spanish Inquisition. As someone currently going through conventional treatment, I found this book counterproductive and would NOT recommend it for anyone currently going through treatment. Even if you just read the sections on stress, mind/body, & vitamins, I still wouldn't recommend it! There are better books out there! Don't waste your money unless you are specifically looking for basic alternative treatment info."
1,waste,"Seen one limo, you have seen them all. Would not even consider it bathroom material unless you were going to wipe with it"
1,Advertised deep discounts,It's nice to see that when you advertise deep discounts it includes an $80.00 increase in price.
3,Buy it for Lucille,The first cut - a 10-minute talking autobiographical story of his life - is worth the cost of owning this album. The other cuts are good (how many bad songs did BB do?) - but have the typical tinny sound of his early work. I prefer his later music when his voice got a little deeper and the recording quality improved. The single Lucille is one BB's great studio recordings!
3,Nice experience,"It brought back all the memories of ""Grease"" on Broadway. I am in a modern day choir and we picked songs out of it and it was so much fun, there was so much energy coming from these songs and it was a good experience."
3,okay,"This book is just okay. It should be ""super"" easy piano music. While playing the songs you are just playing the chorus, there is not much extra to play. So, if you want it to sound good, this is not the book. I guess I may try to find a bit more advanced book. Oh well...you don't know until you try it."
4,In between...,I like it but I don't feel pleased with the purchase... Wasn't what I was looking for but oh we'll... Grease is the word!! :)
2,"Buggy, buggy, buggy","It'd be wonderful to have a computer game version of the board game Diplomacy, but this game is unplayably buggy.Even with the latest patch (v1.1), the tutorial messages have spelling mistakes and odd characters in them. The rotation and scrolling of the game board are choppy and doesn't work properly. The avatar animations are silly and repetitive, but disabling them makes it impossible to do negotiations. At startup, the entire screen goes black for about 60 seconds before coming back up to the entry menu. And there's many, many other bugs.I own several Paradox Interactive games and often find them to be buggy, but this one is unplayable. I give it two stars instead of one only because I desperately hope the next patch gets this game to the point that it is usable.It really would be fun to have a computer version of Diplomacy, but this attempt by Paradox is too buggy to play."
1,Appalling & Absolutely Awful,"If I could give this PC game a lower rating, I would. Paradox Interactive has dropped the ball and is selling a catastrophe for $40. This isn't just a bad game, it's bad software outright. The poor user interface renders this PC adaptation simply unuseable - failure at almost every turn. But don't let these reviews fool you, the board game is wonderful (buy it instead or search the internet for a free Diplomacy software).For a review I mostly agree with, go here:http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/diplomacy-2005/665958p1.html"
1,blankety blank blank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it had great promise... but, alas alak, after spending a few hrs learning the tutorials and reading the manual, and having a few minutes of winning....it started showing what the other reveiwers c/o...multiple bugs, screw ups, frustratingly getting frozen, not allowing the player to make his moves during a turn, not alowing a easily readable playing interface....not letting you see what a fellow's treaty proposal is/was....i finally got so upset, i broke the CD and tore the box and manual into smll peices! i may not buy another avaon hill comp game in a long while!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Very buggy, very slow, poor graphics, the list goes on...By far the worst game I have ever purchased. Paradox should be ashamed of selling this garbage.Thank god I only spent $10 (including shipping).Buying fast food would have been a better investment!"
4,I didn't find it as buggy,"I received this game as a Christmas gift last year and because of all the negative reviews I didn't install it for some time. There were a few positive reviews about the multi-player session, however I was looking mainly to play this by myself. I haven't played Diplomacy in years because I haven't had anyone to play with.I've only played a few games, but I really have only seen one error. Reloading the game from before the error happened fixed the problem and no other issues occurred with that game.The AI is a bit simplistic and the animations are a bit annoying after a while, especially when they seem to get ""stuck"" and take a little while longer than normal. But it's still fun to be able to strategize and play.I think at a discounted rate this game is worth it, but don't expect anything more than basic gameplay and be prepared for a few bugs."
1,Not worth getting,"It sounds fun but it isn't worth one cent. Computer players are horribly and annoyingly stupid especially in alliances. The game is so limited that you could do know everything about it with just one play, this could never be worth 20$ or at least they should have put more effort into the game."
1,Difficult to use,"I play the board game and enjoy it. I have played the old PC game and found it useful but not particularly challenging. When this game came out, I was eager to get it. I have spent two sessions trying to get through all the set-up and directions and find them laborious at best. It promises good features, but I haven't yet waded through all the muck to reach them. Since I've already paid for it and I enjoy Diplomacy, there will probably come a day when I try again to get it up-and-going, but probably not today."
4,Diplomacy,Fairly good game. Tutorial had some problems but otherwise all right. Bought it because my new computer would not play the old version I had.
5,Probably the best book on CFT,"I have come across some books and lecture notes on CFT, but this book truly is great - almost all notes are based on this book. It presents elementary CFT at an understand pace and progresses slowly towards the end to the more advanced topics in 2D string theory and statistical physics.The book is pleasant to read and the derivations are done well. Some minor errors and typos are forgiven, because the rest of the book makes well up for them. Numerous examples are given in each section and there are many problems at the end of each chapter. Unfortunately, there are no detailed solutions available, as far as I know.Some prior knowledge of QFT might be useful, but the basics (Lagrangian formalism, Wick's theorem, Noether's theorem and conserved currents, etc.) are provided in the first chapters. This book is highly recommended for those interested in CFT and its application to string theory (and statistical physics), and I even dare to say it is a MUST!"
4,The Aging Brian,"This episode focuses on what happens to our brains as we age and how healthy habits will keep our brains intact as we grow older. One woman Neuroscientist from Mcgill University was an excellent example being that she was 91 years old and as smart as a whip. Eric Kandel, while not as old as the woman is also a good is example. The amount of knowledge this man has is staggering. This episode also examined the case of the man popularly known to neuroscience as HM who had a lobotomy which took away his ability to form new memories. They discussed how even though he was unable to form new memories, he was still able to learn new motor program which utilize the cerebellar circuits."
4,A QUICK READ,This would have been a good one to put on the TV series. Found a few errors...but overlooked them. The idea of the crew getting separated was appealing. The end of the book reminded me of the final TV episode where Picard joins his crew in a recreational activity. I recommend this to TNG fans...although...I wish Worf was more involved.
4,Little tiny errors marr this book.,"This book is very interesting,to say the least, but that doesn't quite cut it. As you get in to the book, you find yourself thinking more about the climax than what you're reading at the moment.It just gets too murky and boring. The ""mud/clay"" monster is very cool,I must admit, and this book vaguelly reminds me of a much creepier trek book; J.M. Dillard's ""Bloodthirst"", aka.in both books, an away team lands on a remote science planet, and finds the most of the rescearch team dead, and ones still alive are not able to talk about what happened for one reason or another, and the crew must find out what they're hiding, or the Federation will be destroyed."
1,Just couldn't get into the story.,"After forcing myself to read 30 pages I couldn't get into the story. I wasn't made to care about the characters or their dire situation. I was familiar with the characters, but I didn't see the characters I knew from the TV show. I felt the crew frequently calling Captain Picard 'Jean-Luc' was inappropriate and out of character. The dialog was written as if only one person was speaking for everyone. During a wardroom discussion, Data refers to Commander Riker as 'Captain', which indicated to me that I could expect other distracting inacurracies were I to continue reading. I plan to donate my copy of this book to the local library's fifty-cent sale bin."
2,ST:TNG snoozer,"Apparently the warp drive and navigational systems were offline, because this book took forever to go nowhere! The enterprise takes a mud bath that goes awry, so Picard and co. must save the day while dealing with totally uninteresting minor characters."
3,Not the best,"The pace of this book was slow at te begining. The writer has concentrated on small and unecessary details too much. After one gets through the begining, the pace gets very high and exciting. It is not the ideal Star Trek book ever; however, it is not the worst. I aggree with the other reader that this would've been a good plot for TV. There weren't many serious errors."
3,it was okay,"The mud monster is pretty cool,but the book moves a little slowly at times, the romance is ridiculously long."
3,Double What?? You said Vanilla????,Was looking forward to this coffee. When it arrived I brewed a pot right away. Damn! No discernable vanilla taste and I bought the double vanilla! The coffee overpowered any flavor of vanilla. The flavor of the coffee is good by itself but you will be disappointed by the lack of vanilla taste.
1,useless,"Was not clear in the product description this is made for older monitors -- NOT FLAT SCREEN. Could not even use! If I could have given ""0"" stars, I would have."
2,Screen Magnifier,"The screen magnifier fits fine on your conventional CRT monitor but it really does not magnify to a size big enough to satisfy our employees needs. At least that was our perspective in the office. However, it's easy to install and it looks good on the monitor. It also has a glare that helps viewing."
3,Magnifies well,This magnifies the screen very well for my father.The big draw back to this product is that it is set up to attach to a old style monitor.We had to jimmy rig the attachment to put it on a slim monitor and it would not work on the newer versions.
2,Returned,Would not work with my screen type. Did not really magnify any of the font enough to be of any help.
5,Penn State Clock/Pen,I bought this product for my girlfriend's mother. She just loves it. The product is everything the seller said it is. The material is made of great quality. It is just professional in appearance and overall. I will absolutely buy from this seller again.
1,defective,"It was defective in that when I opened the lid, the back attachment was totally unattached from the base. It seemed to be poorly assembled."
4,this game rocks!!! =-),"this game is awsome.even thought the gaphics and controls are some times really bad.you can change them.the game is short and fun.they have cool bosses like ninga (a.k.a GREY FOX),and raven.also it comes with VR missions.there are about 150 of them.the game is old but still a good one.it also started the steath seris of games.so if MGS didnt come out we wouldn't have Splinter Cell.you we have lots of fun with MGS!"
4,Inspirational Stories of Courage,"Two Women: Great stories of two women who put themselves in danger for the lives of others. I would love to see this come out on DVD. I see there were two other films done, Two Couples and Two Families. Sorry to say I missed those and would like to see them."
3,Almost Good,"There are so many good books about the Big History (always spelled with capitals) that some writers feel the need to look for almost history (with no capitals at all). Christopher Bram made an attempt to carve a sizeable novel out of a not-so-important (from the point of view of the US) historical event and a not-so-interesting character. The result, as one might quite easily guess, is not-so-good. One can quite easily see Bram's good intensions (a non-standard gay character, a non-standard point of view etc.) but don't we all know the real value of good intensions? I am no specialist on the Philippines but sticking to home turf does him much better. An Almost Good Read in effect."
1,"As a gay, Filipino male, I am very insulted by this book.","I was very upset with the content of this book. Christopher Bram seems to enjoy taking historical moments and dramatizing them for the sake of his white American gay characters, who tend to be the heros of this fiction, while the people of color characters tend to be victims. He fails to show the ability of these characters to be social agents against the many barriers they face. In ""Almost History"", Bram uses second hand knowledge of Filipino history and figures to show the corruption that ensues in the Philippines, but fails to acknowledge America's hand in starting the whole thing. Basically it's a repetition of the whole big-white-brother/little-brown-brother, racist,condescending bullshit. Bram should check himself on how he portrays the Philippines, people-of-color, and his role in continuing third world peoples oppression via mainstream media"
1,Poorly designed,"The basket is made of plastic and some suction system that doesn't work. I follow the instructions and 2 minutes after I locked the basket on the wall, it fell down. Since it is plastic, it is broken now. I will buy a shower cart or something I can place on the floor."
2,Good for awhile,I was looking for a way to store bath products within easy reach.We didn't want to make holes in our new tub surround so I thought this would be perfect.It mounts securely and does hold a lot of items.However you never know when the suction is going to release!Several times we were awoken by a loud crash as this basket and contents hit the bathtub.So I have mixed feeling about it - it is good while it holds!
3,"Advanced topics, excellent examples, bad writing","This textbook covers advanced epidemiology concepts that are necessary for anyone involved in research. It has excellent examples and a logical layout. The major drawback to this book is the writing style-- it is ""scientifically"" written (translation: hard to read).The sentences are unnecessarily long, full of unnecessary prepositions and fluff, redundant, and they repeat themselves (see what I mean?).The following example:""Consequently, and as underscored in the sections that follow, the interpretation of the multiple regression coefficients is similar for all these models, varying only with regard to the outcome variable.""Could simply be:Consequently, the multiple regression coefficients for all these models have similar interpretations, varying only by outcome variable.This textbook gets a 5 for content and a 2 for style."
5,There is a previous different book too - get em both,This version is Hollywood Portraits: Classic Scene Stills 1939-1951it is a BDD promotional publisher book / AKA Mallard PressThis version has Cary Grant on the cover. Gorgeous hard back book.Oversized with full page (huge pages) images throughout. Amazing glossy pages with the highest quality images that you don't already own.The book before this is Hollywood Portraits: Classic Scene Stills 1929-1941 you will love that one too. This book is not a redo or a rehash of the 1929-1941 version either. No duplicate info or images.Read my reviews for a direct link to the previous version. Add them both to your collection.
5,Timeless Pictures from the Golden Age of Movies,"If you feel as I do that the golden age of movies produced the best Hollywood has ever offered, then this picture volumn of stars that filled our lives with adventure, mystery, love, tragedy, laughter, suspense, heroism, surprise and imagination will serve as a reminder of those portals through which we entered other worlds and lives as we sat in our seats glued to the screen while munching on popcorn and slurping soft drinks. There, in the quietness of your home, you can imagine all over again."
5,highly overlooked,why isn't this record/cd more available and why is it so expensive for a new copy?
2,"40 % brilliant , 60 % rubbish",Todd has a two or three excellent songs on this release .Love is the Answer is quite superb .The majority of the material is very weak though .The good songs are available on other compilations . Pass this one .
4,Power Pop Todd,"One listen to Oops! Wrong Planet will tell you that Todd was listening carefully to the then burgeoning new wave scene. Gulp! It's so energetic, it almost sounds like an XTC album. Many of the songs are catchy, tuneful, and full of high energy, particularly the burning ""Trapped"" as well as ""Gangrene"" and ""Love Is the Answer."" But then there's the group's arty side as exemplified by the quite lovely track ""The Martyr,"" ""The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"" and the groovin' ""Abandon City."" Naturally, there are a few tracks that really go nowhere (e.g. the ballads ""Crazy Lady Blue"" and the execrable ""Windows""), but these shortcomings are what one expects from Todd: enormous talent, sometimes unfocused, but always engaging."
3,Decent Exercises,Be carefull not to confuse this softcover as equivilant to the hardcover textbook. It is actually the laboratory workbook intended as supplemental to the textbook and tapes.
1,Disappointed,"The picture showed a copy of the 3rd Version. That is what I expected to receive. Instead, I received the Eighth Version. Since, I only paid 99 cents for the book, I am not going to return it, but it would have been nice if the vendor had described it accurately."
4,"Tasty, but not enough for 5 people","These meals are tasty, easy to prepare, and inexpensive. However, while the box claims that it feeds five people, I've found that two and a half is closer to the mark. Even so, it's a good value."
1,Chintzy,This thing was great for about 4 weeks then stared disintegrating. Not happy with it at all.
2,Nice looking if you don't mind ripping apart your feet,I've owned many pairs of Bruno's and never before have had a pair that tore at my feet. I thought that this was short term and they just needed to be worn in but NO. I guess thats why these are always on sale. They look great but are just about unwearable. Buyer beware.
1,MISREPRESENTED,Placed order for a plastic gear but found out it was not what I thought itwas 30 minutes later so telephoned Amazon immediately to cancel. Too late. Refused package when delivered by UPS.Was credited for item but had to pay shipping and handling.I was billed $21.44 and after the credit of $12.87 it only put me out $8.57for something I could not have used under any circumstance.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Coming out of the events of Avengers Disassembled, the Scarlet Witch has clearly gone completely round the bend. Her bend is a bit of a Mobius strip type doozy, as she recreates the whole world in a manner that her warped mind sees fit.Everything is now different, and only a few realise it, or begin to realise. Those that do have to work out what to do about it. Save her, or annihilate her.Generally pretty average."
4,"Pretty good, minus the slowness during the middle.","House of M is a very interesting story in the X Men/Avengers series. I had a bit of a problem with some of the writing half-way through the book. One thing Bendis is good at is dialogue, but too much dialogue at times, especially with more than one character. I'm not saying the writing is poorly done, but he puts a lot of effort into making characters hold conversations that protrays them to sit around talk for several pages. Once get through half of the book, I suggest putting it down for awhile and then picking it back up when your mind is fresh and you've processed everything that has happened and what's been said. Once you reach the last few chapters, it gets really interesting and the plot thickens at the end. I enjoy these sort of changes that happen superhero comics, I think anyone who is a new X men fan and is looking for any X men comics to start at, this is it."
2,not too good...,"maybe it's because i didn't read avengers disassembled, but i just didn't buy into the house of m and its story. felt more like an elsewhere alternate reality non-continuity story than anything else. you won't miss much by passing on this one."
2,A boring story and complete waste of money,"If you're looking for a graphic novel that both provides good story and good art, then you might want to pass on this book, especially if you're a fan of Marvel during the 80s. House of M did nothing but bore me to tears because nothing much happened except for at the end with the whole ""No More Mutants"" deal.I'm a big fan of alternate reality stories and was looking forward to seeing what the marvel heroes would look like here. I was very much disappointed because with the exception of a couple pages of Ms. Marvel and Wonderman in action, the world of House of M was a boring one where people did boring, everyday things with the only difference being that some of those people had purple skin and butterfly wings. I would have cared more for the emotional side of things if it hadn't been that I was bored out of my skull and the emotional moments came at the detriment of the characters.Do yourself a favor and pick up Age of Apocalypse instead."
2,Should have stuck with Powers,"This story pretty much ruins some of your favorite heroes perhaps forever. The scarlet witch was ruined at the start of the story, Pietro is ruined by the end of it. Many heroes turn out to be so different from their original conception it can't help but disappoint long time fans. To think they would lay the whole Gwen Stacy thing on us at this point and make her preferred over Mary Jane just makes me shudder.Personally I don't want to see my childhood heroes reduced to a state that they have more incommon with villains than they do with their former selves. The worst part is that I love ""Powers"" by the same author. Its fine if he turns that universe upside down because we expect it and can even look forward to such a gritty portrayal of superheroes but it just doesn't belong here in the marvel universe."
4,"Great story, but the collection is too short.",Would've been better if the collection were larger. Great story and great artwork. Definitely worth the read but maybe not with the price.
3,it's alright,"its ok. the art work is good. the writting is good. the reason it doesnt get five stars is because it feels rushed. it could have been longer. i wish it was longer. instead of having like 5 spin off books they could have gone into more int detail on spiderman's life in the house of M world, but instead they reserved all of that in a separate book. the ending is pretty good. the plot is good. not bendis's finest but good read."
4,Great artowrk. Capturing story.,"This whole House of M storyline really had me wondering what would happen next. The entire Marvel universe turned upside down. If you get this first volume, you will be getting the next few shortly after."
2,Wii USB cooling fan,Fan was noisy and bulky. It got the job done but was too noisy to bother using. When in standby it would not turn off.
5,cooling fan,great cooling fan maintains my wii cool it doesn't get anymore warm like it used to never though this fan was going to work but it does is quiet some people say that is loud and is not loud at all works great quiet and easy to use
4,"Good fan, Cheap, but alittle noisy.","This is a decent fan, It does its job. My only problem with the thing is that its alittle loud....But thats not really a problem. My friend has a expencive PS3 cooling fan that is JUST as loud.Overall its a good fan for the cheapo price. And if it can extend life of your Wii...Its totally worth it!!"
3,"Good album, but no DTS?","I suppose this could be more of a problem with my particular player, but my player will not output the music (except from the videos) on the digital optical cable--only through the analog multi-channel outputs. I like the music, but it isn't a particularly good demo of my surround sound system."
3,Foreigner,ForeignerI purchased this CD after seeing Foreigner in concert. It is pop rock and is a part of my past. Listen to it rarely.
2,Very Disappointed In This Remastering,"I bought this CD from the MOFI site.When I first played this CD I was very disappointed in the poor sound quality. My first thought was the original tapes may have sounded this bad because this is from the original master tapes but, after buying and listening to the remastered ""Foreigner"" I then realized how poor the MOFI release truly was.I have many MOFI Gold CDs and they are all ""the best"" when it comes to sound quality.(For the first time) I can not recommend a MOFI release. I hope this is the only one."
2,Why DVD (audio)??,"This is an excellent group, we need a normal DVD, please. I dont understand why some great groups don't have any DVD, for example: Boston, Supertramp, Nazareth etc."
1,Generic,"Along with the debut album from Boston, this one helped launch the generic arena rock into the mainstay of rock in the late 70's and early 80's. Sure ""Cold As Ice"" is a catchy single, but that doesn't excuse the rest of this snooze of an album."
4,A 70s classic... but I don't think it will convert anyone,"Foreigner's self-titled debut is a worthy effort and is a classic of late 70's rock. It is very much a product of its time, however, and it proudly shows features of what is now derided as 'arena rock'-- short, catchy songs about early-20s love told from the guy's perspective, guitar driven sounds with some keyboard seasonings, and a lot of leonine masculine posing. As such, there's no way it's going to convert anyone who thinks that pre-alternative rock categorically stinks. However, those willing to give a listen to something from this bygone era without prejudice may find that there are some darn good songs on here-- a bit dated-sounding, perhaps, but great songs-- especially ""Cold as Ice"", ""Long Long Way from Home"", ""Feels Like the First Time"" and my personal favorite ""Starrider""."
4,Foreigner on A&E's PRIVATE SESSIONS this Sunday!,"Hey Foreigner Fans! I loved this album and think that Mick Jones is amazing! This Sunday, March 29th at 9 am they're going to be performing and interviewed on my new favorite show A&E's Private Sessions. It sucks to wake up early, but the whole hour is on their career!"
4,Great band; Great debut!,"I remember thinking if ""heavy metal"" bands (like Deep Purple) took a major turn towards top-40 ""pop"", the result would probably be FOREIGNER. While it took some time to grow on me (""Cold As Ice"" is still a bit grating) I eventually got to like EVERY SONG on this album. And ""Long Long Way From Home"" has to be one of my all-time top fave rock and roll songs! It's loud! It's THRILLING! It's over in under 3 minutes!! I bet many of today's bands WISH they were this good."
4,super spacious DVD-Audio,This DVD-Audio sports an incredible use of all six channels. Tape hiss is nowhere to be found. I was really impressed with this release and highly recommend it. Now if Warner would only release more Foreigner on DVD-Audio!!
2,junk,"PURCHASED THIS ITEM @ MARSHALL'S,USED IT ONE TIME ON FLAT SURFACE STOVE,WHEN PAN WAS HEATED THE CENTER EXPANDED OUT CAUSING OUTER EDGES NOT TO GET PROPER HEAT.RETURNED THE PAN TO MARSHALLS FOR REFUND THE MGR. THERE TOOK THE PAN AND PLACED IT ON COUNTER AND PUSHED DOWN ON CENTER OF PAN AND HANDED IT BACK. I'LL BE SEND THIS BACK TO Mfr."
1,not worth a penny,"I wore these boots for the first time, Halloween night. I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party, the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs. Cheap cheap cheap, except for the price. I want my money back!"
4,nice,"these boots are awesome as long as you know how to walk in heels lol but other than that they fit nicely though i would recommend getting something soft to put in them, with heels that high it puts a lot of pressure on the upper half of your foot so you need something in there or you will only be able to wear them for about 30 min and have to take them off. but yeah over all these boots are very well put together, they are sturdy, and i am happy with my purchase"
1,poor purchase,"The company sent me the wrong product and then it took over a month to resolve. This was supposed to be a Halloween costume piece, but too bad. The matter wasn't resolved until November. I recommend NEVER purchasing from this store."
2,Reference-not reading material!,"This is a great reference for writing questions or problems. It is horrible, boring, and mind-numbing when assigned as a reading text."
2,Puh-Leez,"This book is So. Expensive. And, it sucks. I had like 3 hours to kill so I were going to read it, and it wasn't even funny. Plus I just hate it."
4,Very helpful,"This book was a requirement for one of my classes and it was very helpful. My professor never taught out of it, but I'm glad she made us buy it. It helped a lot with MLA and APA citations that I had to do for various classes. It's small and handy and light enough to keep around in your bag when you're rushing to class and from class and finishing papers."
1,Incredibly overpriced,This reference book should cost a third or half as much as the list price. I think the only reason for the high price is that it is a required text for a lot of college students.
2,"Boring, improbable story, undeveloped characters...","...This book was primarily boring. The characters are poorly developed - often changing personalities rather drastically (like when Della suddenly becomes a ""wisecracker"" half way through the book). The premise is ridiculous. Would you turn up on your (rather distant) friends' doorsteps terminally ill and expect them to take care of you? The farm itself (which is supposed to be a B&B) is never fully included in the story - it seems just an uninteresting and implausable place. I also always resent it when adulterous relationships are glorified and glamorized. Although nearly everyone had slept with this guy, Richard, they all obsess endlessly about him. GET REAL! He sounds like a jerk. I was glad I didn't buy this book (took it out from the library)."
3,"If You've Seen The Beast, Then by all means watch this","I had seen ""The Beast"" ( La Bete') and decided to give this a try. I actually liked the original as it had a good story. This one has a story, but it is somewhat flimsy. I was reminded of ""Flesh Gordon"" while watching this. The EFX are hokie to say the least. There are some flashbacks from the original, in particular the Horses doing their thing. It is explicit and thus the XXX rating. I would recommend renting it, if possible, before buying. Charlie S."
3,Mesmerizing wierdness,"To counter a few other reviews I've read, I must say if you enjoy Italian cinema at all, you will probably like this, or at least find it wierdly fascinating. The print from Severin films is in pretty good shape, and the DVD has some entertaining extras. Forget this being a sexy movie -- the unrated version, after all, has some kind of random hardcore footage done by none of the actors here, but instead enjoy the sets made of aluminum foil and whatever else they managed to cobble together on a budget. This movie won't win awards for anything, it's true, but it's at least worth a look. Personally I find the bizarre plot more interesting than those of some of the current absurd sci fi movies that are lauded for the virtue of their ""special effects."""
2,For completists only!,"As a lover of most cult films, I found I had to try really hard to enjoy this film. I am a completist so I felt the need to own it, but it lacks most of those things one looks for in a cult film. The pornographic inserts are ""yawn"", no real gore, no real action etc. There are a few small moments of spaceship on a string effects to give camp fans a grin but I have to say that's about it."
3,"surprised ,,,","It looks like they wanted to do a good sci fi movie insted of a good xxx movie, but the result is good it's entertaining .As for the beast I was dissapointed I would of like to see hardcore scene with penetration, but still satisfying.They dont do movies like that anymore it's rare you should see it before it get off the shelf."
1,Not very sexy,"This was a very poor attempt at erotica if it was an attempt at all. Boring, drawn out with very fake sex scenes. Complete waste of money."
5,Fantastic Game,"Whether it's jumping over Lombard Street in San Francisco or Racing in Hyde Park in London, Midtown Madness 2 is fun and exciting in every way. This software includes cruise mode, blitz, checkpoint, and circuit races along with crash courses (Driving schools) in both San Francisco and London. Twenty vehicles range from a Double Decker Bus to a Panoz GTR-1. Jumping on to buildings and driving police cars into the water add to the fun. I rated this software five stars meaning that I highly recommend it."
3,Annoying and difficult tests mar an otherwise good game,"The big flaw of this game is that you have to ""unlock"" the cars by performing various tasks or tests. Some of the tests are very difficult, meaning that you won't be driving some of these cars promised to you on the box's cover for quite some time. The first ""midterm"" for London Cabbie for example, requires very very precise driving within an extremely tight time period - one misstep, and you fail the ""midterm"" (kind of like being back in school!) Don't pass the midterm, and you still don't get to use the fire engine. That sort of thing. I personally feel we paid for the game, we should get all the features without having to run around likes rats in a maze. Besides that it's a great game, but this patronizing approach dings a couple of stars in my book."
3,Still the greatest street-racer game.,"I was kind of disappointed with this sequel. I expected to see the kind of things you see in games that have the ""2"" in the title, but they were only slightly improved. The graphics engine is the same, physics are the same, tracks and cars are what Angel Studios promised with the first title, that they were going to be downloadable via the Internet, but now we have to buy them. If you enjoyed the first one enough to complete all the race modes, then think about this game as an ""Expansion Set"". If you haven't play the first one, then this is the racing game you've been waiting for."
4,"Nice, but a few problems that MM1 didn't have","Ok, when Midtown Madness 1 came out, I fell into love. So when Midtown Madness 2 came out, I bought it. Man, I LOVE this game. I mean, you can race around an ENTIRE CITY, you don't have to just stya on a race track. That is why I love it. Personally, I like San Fran much better than London but thats personal choice cause San Fran has hills.Ok, the problems I had were there are 4-5 cars in this game that hit curbs. I mean, mm1 only had 1 car that did that, this game has way more. That sucks cause it is much harder to drive around. Thats why I didn't rate it 5 stars. Other than that, this game is AWEASOME. I would also recomend Midtown Madness 1 for your Chicagoans."
3,It's OK!!!,"I think this is a fine game at first but in a month it gets kinda boring. Also, when it loads it takes up to 2 mins and i have a P3 933 mhz with 128 ram and a 32 mb video card. Like someone said before this game has a few bugs. Like when the cops chase me for a while they turn around and leave!!????? Also it some cars damage is symmetrical. But i loove the brittish accent in london. All together this is a good game with a few bugs. PS if ANYONE FROM MICROSOFT IS READING THIS MAKE SURE IN MIDTOWN MADNESS 3 THAT IF YOU DRIVE PERFECTLY TO HAVE THE COPS NOT CHASE YOU AND ADD MORE CITES AND A HIGHWAY AND A DESERT AND BRING BACK CHICAGO!!!!!!"
3,"MM2: Fun, yet crude","Midtown Madness 2 is a great game, especially if you have a fairly new machine and all the goodies: steering wheel with force feedback is sweet! However, if your machine is slow, or dosen't have a very good video card, it can be slow and the graphics are pixelly. If your computer is waaaaaay overloaded with incompatible software, it can freeze up entirely, over and over again.Another thing about it is that you must unlock about eight of the best cars by winning races, or completing stunt driver or cab-driver training, which can be a big pain in the rear.The game is very fun to race in. It fairly accurately simulates real racing and street driving, aside from the crude graphics.It would be better if it had Need For Speed-like graphics, and no locked cars, and possibly a few more cars and a few more cities. But, all in all, a fun, fun game.To quote Microsoft: 'the sensible cure for the crabby commuter!' Indeed!"
5,Great!,"I don't have the game, but I do have the trial version and I absolutely love it! It is next on my wishlist! It is a great sequel to the first game. Although the first game was more realistic, I enjoy the second a lot because it is just fun. I don't recommend this game for big racing fans because I really didn't like to play in the races. The cruise option is what really caught my attention. Its like real driving only with a lot of comic relief added in. If you want a real racing game, I recommend the Need For Speed series, but if you just want to settle down and have some fun, this game is perfect! Recommended for all ages."
4,Midtown Madness 2,"Midtown Madness 2 is an excellent followup to Midtown Madness. It has twice the cars, and literally twice the cities. The cities are very well laid out, with all the important landmarks and places to see, as in the first one. There is a wide range of new cars in MM2, including all of the cars from the first one. The damage textures have been improved, with parts that fall off your car, such as a rear spoiler or a bumper. And there is always the awesome internet play, as with the first one. As good as it may seem, there are some drawbacks. Midtown Madness 2 isn't really that different from the original. Microsoft just added new cars and cities, and that was it. I was hoping for different types of gameplay from the first one. Ii is a great game, but if you have the original Midtown Madness, stick with that. But if you're looking for a new racing game, this is it."
4,Endless fun and laughter.,"This is one of the best racing games out there. Instead of being landlocked in a certain racing circuit, as in other games, you get to goof around in the cities of London and San Francisco. It is just one of the most fun things in the world to smash the living cheese out out of the traffic and the cops. I could do it for days; it is just so hilarious. But if you think the game is pointless, there are racing modes with CPUs. You can do all this in 25 cars (some need to be unlocked). It is also possible to download cars off the internet, including exotic Ferraris and Lamborghinis. Endow all this goodness with online LAN capability, and that makes Midtown Madness II a classic."
3,A Trio of Fun,"If you are looking for bundle of racing adventure that will bring you some afternoon fun, then this is the package for you. All three programs are not system monsters so even if your system is a bit older, then this bundle will still run on your computer. The graphics and sounds for Midtown Madness are great, and if you have a steering wheel controller, then you especailly enjoy this game."
2,"Warning, this is NOT a instructional video","Roy is great but I was expecting an instructional video. This is not it. He plays the songs but does not walk you through them slowly as I expected. To make matters worse the camera keeps zooming in and out and fading from one angle to another so you can't follow every move his hands are making. I also found some of the tab hard to follow. It does not seem to match what Roy is playing very well.I'm an intermediate player. I learned quite a bit from watching Roy's' hands but not enough to play an entire song, just some cool cord moves and licks here and there. Also not all the songs on the video are included in the tab book. That seems slack to me. I did enjoy hearing Roy play, sing and tell stories."
5,The Back Story,"I already have several of Roy Bookbinder's videos. In this video (in the studio, no audience) he tells the stories behind some of his better known perfmance works and gives demonstrations of several of the songs. As always, his humor and excellent guitar skills carry the program. The DVD also has the tabulature files for several of the songs included."
3,San Francisco under a groove Vol 1,I bought this based upon reviews but wouldn't rave about it. It's nice but I don't want to listen to it over and over.
3,It works,The item works for what we need - a suggestion box. I did not realize when we purchased it that is was fake wood. It will work fine for us.
2,not like pictured,"Please note that the item looks nothing like pictured. I realize that the description says ""medium oak,"" but that is a very subjective description. If you are trying to match your decor to the color of the wood pictured... don't. We were disappointed. May return it."
3,Vertiflex Product review,"This item is small and sturdy, however, it has not place to put pen and note pad. That would have made it perfect for my needs."
3,"Decent read, unprovocative","This is what it is--a textbook on the Egyptian Coptic Church. It's history book gruel--not particularly insightful or engaging, but it gets the job done. One of the strengths of the book is it is a general history of post-Hellenistic-to-Sadat Egypt. An in-depth analysis of Coptic theology is missing from this book, and that's a bit disappointing. The book tends to focus on the cultural role of Coptic Christians in Egyptian history, such as the influence in business inspite of persecution, poll-tax, and Nasserite socialism. That's good to know, but again, not the stuff you'd look for when reading a book on Traditional Egyptian Christianity."
4,Orange 1981 Commuticar,I injoyed this movie alot since I have an Orange 1981 Commuticar that I drive to work every warm day here in Cheyenne Wyoming. It was unbelievable that out of around 500 Commuticars produced in 1980 and 1981 that one just like mine would be featured in a movie. The movie was a bit strange at times but it had a lot of cute scenes. [...]
3,It's a 3 piece bar... Not a solid bar,It's three pieces that come together to form the 5' bar. An Allen bolt holds the two threaded sides into the Center tube. It feels a little flimsy when you have like 220 pounds on it and more... But it seems to hold together ok. When I ordered it I thought the three pieces were the bar and the two collars... But i was wrong. It's ok.
5,Safe In His Arms!,"This is a short little book filled with knowledge of God and His love for his people! From Jesus to Abraham to Moses, Steve Fry explains how much God really loves his people, and how much he loves you. I reccomend ""I AM"" by Steve Fry, but if you want a shorter version, Here it is!!!"
5,A must-have for your erotica collection!,"I don't know what it is about reading these stories of sexual encounters that really get my juices flowing! After I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down...THEN I couldn't leave my husband alone!! My husband now insists that I get the rest of the Penthouse collection!"
3,It is what it is...,Sometimes you just want to read about someone enjoying themselves and this seems to do that. I've been a fan of Letters To Penthouse for years and still am. Sit back find your favorite story and enjoy. Book mark it so maybe your spouse will enjoy it too. Better yet read it together.
2,Poorly made,I bought the 2mm size and had to send them right back as the ball came off when I tried to remove the back to try them on. Very disappointing.
1,Not 2 mmm,"I have several pairs of 2 mm earrings, and these are not 2 mm. They are so tiny I assume they must be 1.5 or even 1. I will probably never wear mine.Way over-priced for what they are."
3,Read carfully,I am not unhappy with purchase. They are 2mm gold ball earings. but make sure you read and understand measurement carefully. 2mm is very small. ( this is what I did LOL ) An infant could wear them. They have stayed gold never pealed or tarnished.
3,rythms to keep you up at night,"Selection ""Anabacoa"" is a haunter---the beat and lyrics swirl in my brain, yes, si, keeping me awake at night. The joyous shouts of Prado and the distinctive voice More are a wonderful combo mambo!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"INCREADIBLE STORY, THIS BOOK IS A GREAT READ, I HAVE A LITTLE TIME AT THE END OF A VERY BUSY DAY FOR READING. BUT WHEN I STARTED READING THIS BOOK I MADE SURE TO HAVE TIME FOR IT. CONGRATULATION & MY BEST WIHES TO MRS. BALSAM. WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF HER STORIES IN THE FUTURE."
5,A very fascinating story,A perfect subject matter for a movie. Hollywwood will have a fieldday with this one
5,Fast-paced Middle East political thriller!,This is an intellectual person's thriller. The author does a tremendous job of putting her readers right in the action. Balsam weaves an intriguing plot of an American woman caught in Iran at the height of a revolution. The pace of the story accelerates to a shocking finish (don't read the end first!).
2,women artist:all ages,This book was an huge disappointment. I learned nothing from it except that it was copied and printed out and not very well done at that.I actually thought I was bidding on a book...not a cobbled together copy of a book. An outdated and misinformed book at that. This is very sad.
5,Sweet Camera... Great price,"There is no better camera with this kind of balance between: good price, easy to use and reliable, for the common user. Sure it's not a Hasselblad, but not everyone can afford to drop $40,000 on a camera. Auto focus works well. From turning it on, to focusing and taking a picture in good light it takes about 2 seconds. It's not like a regular non-SLR digital camera where you only get the dolphin's splash after he jumped or your kid after he's already run to first base. You can stop the action perfectly and at a reasonable price. I would recommend this to any standard consumer without hesitation."
3,Nikon D40x - problems,"I bought this camera 7 months ago to replace a Pentax SLR film camera.I am not pleased with my purchase.The autofocus is frequently ineffective, and I have had hundreds of shots ruined by uneven focusing. I now do not use autofocus, but manual, and I always shoot two shots of the same scene to ensure that at least one of them is in focus.The 6-point focus of other cameras appears to work better."
4,Works like a charm,"We needed a new digital camera when my Sony DSC-W1 focusing system developed complications after sending it thru the X-ray system. Did my searching online, and I liked detailed comparision of the entire Nikon digital camera line-up at the Nikon USA website. Decided to buy this camera over the D40 because of the 10+ mpixel capability, and the Canon line-up because I had other lenses from my other Nseries Nikon's that I could use.Pros: Light, easy to use and master. Good quality glass element lens. Excellent picture quality.Cons: The 2.5 inch viewer is for playback only. Does not work as a viewfinder."
4,RAW pics not recognized by iPhoto 6.0.6 and Mac OS X 10.4.9,"This review to let customers aware that the NEF (Nikon Raw format) is not recognized by iPhoto 6.0.6 running under Mac OS X 10.4.9. I returned the camera back to Amazon without any problem.Now, about the camera. I was surpised by the small size of the body itself. It felt good in the hand. The screen is very bright. However, I cannot say anything about the quality of the pictures in RAW since my software was not recognizing it."
3,"Nikon, as usual, yes. Amazon prices, NO.","I am quite pleased with the camera. After all , it is Nikon. I have had various Nikons since 1973. The delivery was quick and easy. However, a few days after I purchased the camera, I saw the same camera (and additional lens) is being sold for a whopping $ 215.00 less. So, buy the camera but not from the Amazon stores.Nikon D40x 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens"
3,Shame on Nikon Too,"I have owned, and still own Nikon equipment since 1965. I have taught Photography for 38 years, I get to see every camera on the market through my adult students (post college). I recommend Nikon cameras most often, BUT NOT THIS ONE, this camera only focuses with lenses that have a motor within the lens. That renders all ""D"" series lenses obsolete for auto focusing with this camera model. This Camera has no Depth-of-field preview button, which is vital to understanding focus. Kit lens is to ""slow"" to allow you to take a photograph without camera shake, in your kitchen, unless you use a flash. Your kitchen is usually the brightest room in your house. Look elsewhere, with photographic equipment, You get what you pay for. Try Nikon's D80 with a 50 mm f1.8D lens."
5,Moving up with the Nikon D40x,"I class myself as an advanced hobbyist with regards to photography. In the past, I have used Nikon Pro-grade film cameras such as the F-3 and FM-2. Like many people, I started out slow with digital photography because a lot of the ""experts"" said it wouldn't last. About a month ago, I bought a Nikon D40x w/Nikkor 18-135 lens and have found it to be a wonderful camera. It has enough features to keep the advanced hobbyist interested and yet is simple enough for a beginner. The menus are easy to navigate through and because I didn't have any AF lenses, I don't care that there is no servo (focusing motor) in the body. As with all Nikkor lenses, the quality is first class. The D40x has a built in flash but for serious lighting issues, I would recommend one of the more powerful Nikon Speed lights. All in all, I am very satisfied with the D40x and would recommend it to anyone ready to move up from a point and shoot camera.Mike HarmsFallon, NV"
5,Easy to use,This camera control buttons and menu are so intuitive. Much easier to learn and use than my last one. The hand grip is a good fit and the key buttons easy to find and use while holding the camera in shooting position.
5,I love this camera,"I love this camera. this is my fist SLR, I moevd form a sony point and shot that was very good, but after you use this there is no way back to point and shot. :)Don't know why the kit is getting more expensive every day, I just bought another one for my sister and had to buy the body and camera separately and ended up with a better price (yes doesn't make sense)I bought it with the 18-55mm but ended up changing it for a 18-135mm less expensive than the 18-200mm and very good range..."
5,Great camera for a great price,"Fot that price you can`t buy a better camera!It`s very light, easy to use and has a bigger lcd sceen"
4,good SLR for beginners,"the only downside is the number of lenses that are compatible with auto focus is very limited (the lens need to have its own motor) however if you are comfortable with manual focusing you can attach almost any nikon compatible lens to it. then use it as a manual camera, also I found it difficult to add a lens with low fstop (1.4-1.8) to the camera unless you attach an extension tube or a tele converter between lens and camera. generally speaking I am having fun with it still I prefer my canon ftb 35 mm camera! be aware that the sensor in DSLR cameras are smaller than 35 mm so the actual area that is covered is much smaller, however you can review the picture adjust and do thousands of changes before printing it, also you have great control over flash power.....makes life much easier."
5,Its my baby,"I got this D40x as a birthday gift. Ever since, I fell in love with it! The shots are just amazing, even if you took a photo of something useless, it still looks amazing! I didn't used to like taking photos of kids before because they move and jump around a lot. But with this, everything works great. I get very good 10MP clarity and very stable shots. I suggest this for beginners and pros..!"
5,D40X,"This camera takes really nice pictures and I am really content with my purchase. So far the pictures have been amazing and the camera is very easy to use. I considered the Canon Rebel XTI as well, but I'm glad I selected the Nikon."
2,Missed another great shot,"Once again I missed a great shot with this camera...I can't even begin to tell you how many great shots I missed with this camera.. Point, push the button and nothing. Push the button again, Nothing. Change the ISO, point shoot nothing. This camera has caused me to miss some of the best shots. Because it just doesn't take the picture when you want it. I wouldn't reccommend this camera to someone I hate. I could go on and on about all the aggrivation this camera has caused. But I will simply tell you that you will not be happy with this occasional working camera. Buy at your own risk and you too can miss some great shots. What a shame!"
5,Great camera,"The camera works great. There are a lot of functions that we still need to learn about, but for now the Auto function works fine."
4,Repair manual,Good refrance for specs like spark plug gap. Always handy for the Do It Yourself mechanic like me. Another tool for the box
4,haynes repair manual,Book was in good condition and delivered on time as promised.It will come in handy in the future for any repairs that I can do myself.
4,Not Quite as Good as I Expected...but Almost,"This highly praised book was extremely well-written but not as well plotted as I expected it to be. I realize the story was more surrealistic than realistic, but I feel both the Drome Hotel and the character of DJ Cormorant should have played a larger role in the story.The characters were as twisted and demented as the story of which they are a part. I felt distanced from them but I think this is to be expected when reading a story such as this one.I enjoyed this highly-imaginative book as a change of pace and it's obvious that Alan Warner is an innovative, original and brilliant writer. I think These Demented Lands will appeal to those who enjoy surrealistic, hallucinatory, postmodern literature. Those who require more conventionally plotted stories will probably be disappointed. Nevertheless, if you're looking for something different, give this well-written book a try."
5,wonderful,"the sequel, in an unconventional manner, to warner's first novel 'Morvern Callar'; 'these demented lands' is more gothic, more removed from real-life and more unexpected. the stunning heroine, the said morvern, is witty and a far cry from a sappy female lead. wonderful."
4,Too little time,"This book is a wonderful set of characterisations, and it follows on well from Morvern Callar, but is a classic example of a book written in a hurry, i.e after the success of morvern callar (fantastic book) The storyline ducks and weavs as morvern (not called by name anywhere through the book except at the very end) travels over the island (any guesses where? Four letters - begins with M) to botherhoods hotle where she encounters the aircrash investigator, and from there the storyline progresses.Great book - a little more time would have made a difference perhaps"
5,Finally an inside account of what really happened!,"This is the untold story of the behind the scene investigation behind the Tokyo subway attacks. There are real lessons interwoven here for local government and emergency first responders. While the number of deaths directly linked to the Sarin attacks was relatively low, hundreds of people were taken to area hospitals, overwhelming the system. And this happened in one of the world's most modern cities. Like the canary in the coal mine, this book should be a five-alarm warning to cities worldwide to be vigilant in their preparedness."
1,This Percolator is No good Had 2 Both Are Dead Now,This Percolator is No good Had 2 Both Are Dead Now . Got it all ready pluged it in and it made a load POP sound . Smoke cam from the base . STAY AWAY FROM THIS FROM THIS Percolator . I am now on a hunt for a new one ..
1,"Worked Brilliantly, then Died","I'd been searching for a decent electric percolator for years and thought that I had found it at last. Alas, it made delicious, though scaldingly hot, coffee for about three weeks and then suddenly died. I think perhaps there was a problem with the thermostat all along since the coffee was always much too hot to drink initially after it was brewed."
1,Honeymoon is over,"After just 4 months of minimal use (Monday mornings only), our attractive Hamilton Beach 12 cup suddenly quit. I should have listened. It produces only weak, warm clear coffee as of yesterday.Irreconcilable differences. The required $9.95 shipping to return to the manufacturer is an insult. Good bye Hamilton Beach"
1,Superb coffee while it lasted,"Same experience as many others. Lasted a couple of months and now makes weak luke warm coffee. My wife and I both really liked the coffee and its small footprint, but it has let us down."
1,Makes great coffee when it works!,"We are currently using our third Hamilton Beach percolator, the previous two having failed after 6 months each due to defective thermostats. The first two were replaced under warranty, but obviously the long term prospects for this coffee pot don't look good.We had the same problem with the Farberware percolators which is why we switched to the Hamilton Beach. Perhaps they are made by the same Chinese company?Does anyone make high quality, made in the USA consumer appliances?"
1,Didn't work after one week.,"This coffee pot made very good coffee for one week. After that, when I plugged it in, the circuit-breaker on the outlet popped. I tried several outlets and it happened with each one. I really liked the coffee, too bad they can't fix this product."
4,Quick and Hot!,"I have used many types of coffee makers. I reverted to the old standby, the percolator. I am particularly pleased with my Hamilton Beach coffee maker. It makes coffee with very hot water and keeps it hot. The only improvement I would like to have is a switch that holds in a warm mode so that the coffee does not have to be served immediately. If left on for more than 30 minutesthe coffee becomes too strong."
2,Only lasted a year.,"Ours lasted longer than many other reviewers - about a year of daily use. Now, the coffee is only warm. The larger the batch, the cooler the coffee. Even a six cup batch is too cool to enjoy. Brewing a full pot is a waste of time and coffee. We hope the Farberware 12 cup that we just ordered holds up better.OK, a year and a half later and the Farberware isn't much better. The three pin cord doesn't connect well and the coffee stops perking. We've gone through two coffee pots in three years. Is there a reliable one out there?"
2,Wouldn't buy another and here's why ...,"I guess they don't make anything the way they used too -- especially coffee pots.Now keep in mind that this is the first day of use for me -- the cons so far are -- the basket holes are WAY to big, why did they change from the old small hole design that covered the whole basket? Grounds get all over the lid and in the coffee, that's a no-no.The stem in VERY hard to put in the right spot for perking - they didn't used to be like this years ago.There is no brewer selecter, again, years ago they always had them.Finally, the coffe comes out thick as mud and I'm sure freshly brewed mud would have a much better taste.Here's a note to manufacturers -- this isn't rocket science. Forty years ago every percolater you could buy was a good one. What's up? To many college grads trying to improve on perfection?"
4,user evaluation,"Percolator makes very good coffee and keeps it heated very good.However, inside the pot, the nut that secures the bottom electrical assembly to the pot is corroding in many spots. the corrosion is pitts on the surface of the nut.Otherwise the percolator functions very well."
2,coffee grounds everywhere,"Like many of the ""older"" folk I like coffee brewed in a percolator. I have had a presto for many years but it finally died and I replaced it with a GE percolator which died after about 2 months. Have always had good luck with HB products so thought I would order theirs. Have only had it about 2 weeks and so far so good but after reading the reviews now wonder if it will last even a year. There is one problem that I haven't seen mentioned -- the basket that holds the grounds does not seem to drain fast enough causing the water to overflow the basket and get grounds onto the water spreader and therefore some of the grounds end up in the bottom of the pot. Also, it takes forever for the water in the basket to completely drain delaying my being able to pour the coffee. Would like to know if anyone else has this problem or if anyone has a solution."
2,Great coffee...for a few months,"It made a great cup of coffee, until the cord MELTED to the unit after a few months! I figured that the people that had problems with it were probably just not caring for it correctly, but I take *very* good care of my appliances, and I'm sorry to say, this one just doesn't last."
1,shorty,"After reading reviews I thought this product would be fine. WRONG. It sounds like it will explode for several minutes when first perking. That doesn't bother me as much as the SHORT CORD. I can't even lift the pot to pour a cup of coffee without unplugging the pot. Very inconvenient, and who wants a big extension cord hanging? Also, the water level marks, 6 cups, 8 cups, etc. should be marked on the outside of the pot. Who can see down into the pot far enough to see where the marks are?? I am totally disappointed and would never recommend this to friends."
4,Percolators are the best,I love this Electric Percolator -- it definitely beats any drip type coffee pot I have ever used. Clean up is much easier and the coffee definitely tastes better from the good old percolator. The only slight minus I have is the cord is a little too short.
1,ONLY LIVED 2 WEEKS!!!,"Bought this pot on a whim at Target, thought it was cute. Was thrilled with the coffee for about 2 WEEKS, but then...just as others have said here...weak, lukewarm coffee. Thought the water was getting backed up behind improper grinds, but nope. The thing just isn't working any more. Too bad! I love my mother-in-law's Farberware electric percolator which has been working perfectly for 30 years!"
3,It should last longer,"This is my second Hamilton Beach percolator and after a year and a half of normal, once a morning use, it quit working. It should last longer than that. Otherwise, it makes great coffee."
3,Lid difficult,The lid is very difficult to put on you have to have it just so so very frustratingWish I could have just fixed my old one
1,a bad choice,"I feel it was an unlucky day when I bought this pot. As careful as I tried to be, it was extremely difficult to tell if I had correctly placed the stem (with basket) in the pit. It had to be by ""feel,"" and half the time it was apparently a hair's breadth off and would not perk. Or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet. It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot. A hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk. So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds. I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280. It may or may not last more than a year but at least I can depend on it."
1,Bad Coffee Maker,"This is a well priced perculator that looks good but it quit working after 2 weeks. The guts were a little hard to line up and install after putting the coffee in but that is something I could live with. However, after 2 weeks use the pot started leaking --- big wet spot where the pot was sitting. Bottom Line --- this is JUNK do not waste your money on it."
1,Worked great then went weak,"We bought this as a replacement for a Farberware percolator that broke after being dropped and were happy with it for a month or two, then it started producing coffee that was weak and tepid. After over a month of trying to make it work (it produces decent pots frequently enough to keep us hoping), we are throwing in the towel and trying another brand. Reading the reviews, it seems that others have had this problem. Stay away from this turkey."
4,Why I love this item,"This coffee pot is exactly what I wanted and does exactly what I like, brews coffee quickly and makes best use of the coffee grounds, whereas a drip pot is wasteful and does not keep the coffee hot for a period of time. It is easy to clean and worry free."
1,Pam's review,"At this point I do not have anything bad to say about the percolator I orded. I do however, have this to say about the shipping of my order. When this percolator was ordered, I paid to have 1 day delivery. One day later and the percolator has still not been shipped. I feel the I have been cheated out of a large shipping cost when your company does not follow thru with advertising."
4,Worth the price,"I bought our 12 cup electric percolator 12 months ago. I've been happy with it basically. There have been a few times I thought I'd get a golden brown cup of coffee after brewing, only to pour out a cup of hot water. Evidently I didn't have the stem solidly seated into the hole in the bottom. My bad!The black plastic dome on the lid cracked in half after one month. It's not bothering anything, just looks like heck.So (based on user stupidity) nine times out of ten it delivers rich, hot coffee. The basket is easy to clean, I clean out the vessel monthly with automatic dishwasher crystals (Electrosol). After soaking for one hour - then a little gentle scrubbing with a 3M pad, the interior (plus the basket) looks brand new.After reading bad reviews on Farberware percolators (which I thought were better) I have come to the conclusion that I have the best coffee pot for the money and it's still a workhorse, even with its cracked nob.Go for it!"
1,"Quit working, poorly made","This percolator makes good coffee until the electrical parts start failing within a few months. First I had to wiggle the power cord to make connection. This worked for a couple of months. Now it immediately goes into warmer mode when it is first plugged in. It will not percolate. Don't buy this poorly made unit. Waste of money. I was extremely careful not to immerse or soak the unit when washing, but still total failure in a few months. Junk."
2,Not hot,We purchased this percolator at a local store. It is very easy to use. It has a nice classic look on my counter. No drips when pouring. It brews quckly (12 cups in about +/- 4 mins). The coffee tasted better than the previous drip (Folger's Colombian). All was great except.... it wasn't HOT! I thought hot was the perk of the percolator. I was looking forward to steam whirling up from my cup. No steam. Nothing. It was just better than lukewarm. I am disappointed.
3,Perky Pipen' NOT Hot,"Maybe we hold the record. Our 40616 failed 2 months AFTER the warranty expired. Same thing, thermostat. You have to be VERY careful when you put the stem into the bottom. A little off center and you get luke warm tea. Maybe I'll see if I can get thermostat.Mike"
2,Disappointed,"I loved this percolator for the first three and 1/2 months. Then I had the same problem as others have mentioned. The rod/basket were not seated exactly right, causing improper water flow and untouched grounds. The bigger problem for me, though, is an internal leak, which causes water to get into the plug mechanism. Fortunately, my percolator is plugged into a GFI outlet, which now shuts off automatically almost everytime I lift the percolator to pour my first cup of coffee. Apparently, the water is dripping from where the handle connects and then down into the plug.At any rate, I have contacted Hamilton Beach in the hopes that they can invesstigate the concerns many of us have had. Perhaps they need to take a closer look at the product."
3,Coffee is good when the coffeepot works,"This coffee pot was good until about 9 months after I purchased it. It stopped working for a day or so, then was fine for another couple months. Less than a year old, and when I plugged it in, sparks flew. (the top black knob had cracked as well) So I called the Hamilton Beach warranty number......They are sending a return label....I should receive it in 7-10 days....Then when they receive my coffee pot back, they will send out a new one, which I should receive in a couple more weeks. So for the month I am without a coffepot, I now need to go buy another one to use until I receive the new one! I don't think it will be a Hamilton Beach!"
5,hi quality and not perfumy,"i've been using this incense for over 10 years now. the sandalwood scent is my favorite out of all the others offered by morning star. i have tried a lot of different brands over the years and Morning Star incense is one of the best on the market. i judge the incense by how natural smelling they are. for me, the less perfume smelling, the better. these have a more woody, earthy smell rather than a ""nag champa"" perfumy smell. if you like a natural sandalwood scent than i think you'll be happy with these. and amazon has a great price for them."
2,Not impressed,"This incense is more smoke than fragrance. The little sticks, with no wooden center, break very easily and don't fit many conventional holders. I bought sandalwood, and the seller sent me a sample of 12 other scents. None of the scents had any staying power. As soon as the stick extinguished itself, the smell was gone. And it was never more than a vague, woody smell overpowered by a burning-match smell. Go for Gonesh."
3,tiny,these are about half the size of normal incense. no sticks. its made in hong kong and it smells ok....
5,I saw them perform at the Sivananda Ashram! Jai!,"I was lucky enough to see a five night performance by the two lead vocalist. It was such a lovely time, they were reading from the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, and the performance was just great. I bought the CD afterward and was very pleased. It was the only CD I had for a short road-trip right after I left and we just played it over and over. I still do and just sing and sing along. I never sing in my car but its difficult not to with this lively Kirtan. Anyway buy this CD if you are into melodic mantra recitation and you are hip to Krishna, as the CD cover suggests."
5,Nice Bag for the Price,I purchased this bag and have used it almost every day since it was delivered. The quality is great for the price you pay. I carry all kinds of tools and supplies with me were ever I go to do my service work.
4,and now for something completely different,"I bought this book with low expectation for both the poetry and the story. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. Emperor's Babe is sexy, stylish and just the most original book I've read in ages. The heroine is a tough little customer, a hip Afro Roman living in Londinium who meets the man of her dreams and loses everything else. By the time you come to last page I promise that you will be moved by her story."
3,It's alright,I had to read this book for a class--it was beautifully disturbing but worth the read. the only thing I had issues with is receiving this package-never got it.
3,"Neat idea, but small bag.","The bag produces lots of sound, unfortunately it only fits a 15"" laptop. Not a 15.4"" laptop. Beware. Really, who makes a 15"" laptop?"
4,Good Second String Recordings,"The Schuman Third Symphony was a Leonard Bernstein specialty, and his two recordings are superior to Schwarz' account here. It's not a bad performance, though Schwarz takes the climax of the Chorale movement too fast and then the climax at the end of the symphony too slow. But either Bernstein account is to be preferred. Schwarz does better with the Fifth Symphony, so overall this is a nice disc providing alternative accounts of these two works for those of us who have subsisted on Bernstein for decades. But if you don't have a recording of the Third, start with Bernstein on DG."
2,Disappointing writing for a decent story,"I made the mistake of reading this one immediately after reading Primal Fear, which I mostly enjoyed. I was so disappointed by the way Diehl seemed to cut-and-paste descriptions and characterizations from Primal Fear. I found myself reading exactly the same words when the author referred to Vail's hometown, Guido's restaurant, and Jane Venable's killer courtroom attire. If you've read Primal Fear, give Diehl a rest before you pick up Show of Evil. Hopefully you've put his descriptions out of mind and the text will appear refreshing (as it was the first time) instead of replayed."
2,Dissapointing,"William Diehl's sequel to Primal Fear made dissapointing reading. There seem to be too many charaters in ""Show of Evil"" .The romance of Vail's associates is mundane and does not interest. Even the affair between Vail and her bete noire - Jane Veneble seems out of place for someone who has raed and enjoyed ""Primal Fear"". There are at least two sub plots the presence of which is unjustified. The sub plots divert the attention of the reader and the only purpose they serve is to increase the number of pages in the book.Perhaps the only reason book is readable is because of the characterization of Aaron Stampler . If he was an innocent boy charged with murder in ""Primal Fear"", he is evil personified in this one.I hope the sequel to this one is much better ."
3,Back to The Past,"I liked all the twist and turns in this book, but what bothered was always refering to Primal Fear and the whole retelling of that story, you read on hopeing that he will get on with telling this story and not the last one... I still think that this book had some wonderful ups and downs to make it a good book to read."
5,Better Than Primal Fear! And That Was Good!!!,"William Diehl's follow up to Primal Fear, Show of Evil is even better than the first. Diehl has worked much harder at providing background, tying strings of information together, explaining strategy and showing Martin Vail as a more seasoned, less egotistical, lawyer than he was in the the story set ten years earlier. Interesting commentary on the justice system throughout and very good discussion on the ""theatre of the courtroom"" as one of the valuable sidelights. Jane Veneable, Abel Stenner and a few of the characters remain from Primal Fear -- foremost among them, the frightening Aaron Stampler aka/aka... Great book! Diehl should continue using Martin Vail and Jane Veneable as ongoing characters."
2,"Too crammed, too much, not enough","William Diehl's previous book, Primal Fear, about Adam Stampler was mind-tingling and jaw-dropping. This one sought to accomplish too much. Why does the book devote so much time to Jane Venerable's case about the women, her boss, and her daughter? Why not stick to the real source of villainy, Adam Stampler? The book is too crammed; Diehl should have taken a few of the mini-mysteries and saved them for another novel in order to give them all due justice. Although a masterful writer that shocks you on every page, his Show of Evil is not enough like Primal Fear to warrant a good review."
1,Riding the fame wagon,This was a waste of money which I would most certainly accept back in small bills in a heartbeat. Waste of apathy and cynisism. thanks but no thanks.
4,Getting the girl,This is a great manual for older boys suffering from puberty. I'd say 18 and above. I have 2 young boys and I'm saving my copy for them to read when old enough. I thought it was respectful to women and pretty true from the female perspective! Way to go Colin.
5,Definitely beneficial,"I began reading this book thinking that it was going to be totally sexist and vulgar. My mind wasn't very open to what I was about to read, but once I started, I found myself laughing and agreeing with a lot of the things that Colin writes. He nails the wants and needs of most women right on the head and even proceeds to explain the ways of women to the average clueless male. The book is a quick and worthwhile read. If you don't find yourself laughing at something on every other page, perhaps you should lighten up and get a sex life. Mad props."
3,Thank you Colin thank you!,"Great book, especially Colin's chapter about learning to stop masturbating compulsively. It's an embarrassing affliction that very few men are willing to discuss, and I appreciate Colin's willingness to talk about how he overcame his problem (and mine, I admit!). Colin-- it's SO true that we should love ourselves and not hurt ourselves.Enjoyed the chapter on grooming, too, particularly Colin's tips on dealing with huge facial moles. You were right, Colin-- a little bit of linseed oil each morning really does keep those weird long hairs from sprouting!Kudos to you!"
5,Funny,"Colin is such an intelligent person and it comes across in this book. It is hysterically funny and so honest, which it makes it even funnier. Def. worth the read!"
5,Still delightfully entertaining!,"This is the third of the Amphigorey series. Like those before it, this book is witty, charming, horrifying, and a delight to read. Filled with gothic illustrations, these short stories will sometimes chill you, sometimes confuse you, yet always entertain you."
4,"Great, Also","This compilation, being the third in the series, is naturally the weakest of the lot, but it still contains some absolutely enchanting bits of morbidity, including The Blue Aspic, The Glorious Nosebleedand The Loathsome Couple."
5,Would certainly recommend this,"Bought this to help sight-in a new Benelli M2 12 gauge Slug gun and Nikon SlugMaster scope. Out of the box it looked well made and was easily assembled. Instructions were easy to follow. I sighted in first at 25 yards, then at 35 and finally at 50 yards. I chose to do this about a half-hour before sunset when the laser dot was easily seen. 50 yards was about maximum for visibility of the dot. I removed the unit from the gun between target shifts to preserve the batteries (having read those reviews which criticized battery life). The whole exercise took about 20 minutes to get the scope dead on the dot at 50 yards, with the laser showing no sign of fading. Excellent product. Now to fine tune the scope at 100 yards at the range......"
2,Not Impressed,Went to the range to sight in my 12 ga. slug gun with this bore sighter and wasted two boxes of sabots without being able to sight in. I Finally had to give up on it and do it the old fashion way.
3,Good,"This bore sighter would have been an exceptional item. Except for the fact that it does not fit nice and snug in the chamber, it is a little bit over sized."
4,Unspoken,Very enjoyable from start to finish as most of Lisa Jackson's books are. She just gets better with every book she writes.
4,Another Great Read by Jackson,"Suspense, murder,and lies it is all here. Shelby Cole has a dark secret she wants to keep secret and a daughter that she is determined to find. But in order to find the daughter she must go home to Bad Luck Texas to her father and family secrets that she would rather avoid. There is also a man from her past Nevada Smith. The towns bad boy who Shelby had fallen in love with 10 years earlier and who she thinks is the father of her missing child. Add to this a murder suspect is released from jail and the murder is opened again. Who killed Ramone Estevan 10 years earlier and why? And how does is effect Nevada, Shelby, Ross, and the Judge. Your going to have to read the book to find out. A great effort by a talented author"
1,AWFUL rehashed story from the 90's,"I usually like this author, and picked this up from the new paperback section before my flight. As I began the book I was absolutely dumbfounded at the amateur writing style and Harlequin romance dialogue of the book! I began to skip entire pages, determined to find the Lisa Jackson I was used to. It NEVER happened! And then.... at the end of the book was a note from the author about how much fun she had re-visiting these characters from the book and ""tweaking"" it to be more modern. Turns out this is one of her earlier works from the early 1990's and it is absolutely positively not worth one penny. I felt hoodwinked by the fact they marketed it in the new section. Do not waste your money. Painful. And frustrating as I had only grabbed this one book because I had read everything on my kindle so needed a book for a two hour flight! I am sorry to say I read the whole thing all the way through. They should tell you if the book is an old re-worked story!!!!"
1,unspeakably awful,"I usually like this author...but I'm done. This book was just terrible - trite and predictable, and so repetitive. Story lines that kept going off on side tangents that lead nowhere, in-depth pov from characters who have nothing to do with anything; and two of the most cliche-riddled main characters I've read in a long time. The characters were shallow and unbelievable, and the dialogue (internal and spoken) is so repetitive and so bad it's ridiculous. At one point the female lead, while fighting for her life with a very-bad-guy-rapist type, actually says ""get off me, you cretin!"". I laughed. And then I shut off my kindle and wished I could get my money back."
3,Good book,Good characters..easy to follow .had a little romance in it.took some time to get the plot line going. Try it and see.
3,shelby cole spoilt princess is in trouble,"Shelby Cole is a Texas born spoiled young woman. She moved to Seattle years ago and receives a photo of a young child, which she suspects is a child that she gave still birth to.Nevada is a former policeman that has always lived in Texas, he has a history with Shelby Cole and her father Judge Cole.As the story goes along you learn about betrayals and secrets the Judge and the townspeople. Tossed in the mix is a obnoxious man named Ross that raped Shelby at that time too.Who is the child and is she Nevada's or Ross'?"
2,Boring Read,"Characters were so stereotypical. Strong cowboy, town drunk, town meanie and poor helplessself involved rich girl daughter of the local Judge. Not even an interesting story line. It will beawhile before I try another Lisa Jackson."
3,Just barely holds my interest,Too much sex and not enough mystery and intrigue. It was too easy to figure out what was coming next. It was ok but not my favorite mystery novel.
2,Ick,"Reads like she wrote it for Harlequin earlier in her career. Not really believable, and heavy on the stereotypical bad-boy (but not really) -meets-rich-princess (who's really not) theme. And a thesaurus would have helped -- the use of the phrase ""half-breed"" was frequent enough to be annoying."
1,unspoken,"Moved really slow & the author was more concerned with sex than plotting a good story. Very disappointed, was more like a bunch of stories from PlayBoy with a silly who dunnit stuck in between! I am from TX & I doubt author ever came here! Her Texans never seemed to have any a/c!! No one drives with the windows down & the sunroof open @ noon when it's 100!! Taking a break from her books for a while. Really disappointed."
3,Not Up To Her Usual Standards,Way more sexual content than necessary. Could have been a really good story but the book built up and then wrapped up very predictably in the last couple of pages.
1,Weak,Weak plot and not much substance. Characters uninteresting. The discription of Montana life was the only redeeming factor. Most likely will not read this author again.
3,Entertaining,While entertaining the story was lacking in details and suspense that would have drawn the reader in to the plot.
3,"Unspoken, a good Lisa Jackson","Interesting! I would like to see more detective work and not just ""There it Is"". Jackson writes a very good mystery. Maybe a little too much sex. We know what goes and don't need the blow by blow."
5,"Great romance, suspence","I love intelligent romantic suspence stories. I loved this book. You can feel for Shelby, who had her world turned upside down at the age of seventeen, and Nevada, who had Shelby, the love of his life, walk away from him, not knowing what she was going through. They come together again ten years later, to solve a very personal mystery. It's the kind of story I love reading."
3,So-so,"I've read other Lisa Jackson books and liked them, but this one was just kinda blah.It wasn't what I would call a suspense or a romance book. It was just a story of fiction.I'm a real bookworm and can usually finish a book within 1 1/2 days, this one took me over a week and it's only 362 pages. It just didn't hold my interest.If you've never read a Lisa Jackson book before then I don't recommend starting with this one. If you typically like Ms. Jackson's suspense books - don't expect this one to be up to her regular standards. If you're the type of person who just has to read everything their fav author writes then go ahead and read it because it's not terrible."
3,A little too much sex,"I would probably read more of Lisa Jackson as far as plot, characters, etc. but the 6-8 page long sex scenes are not worth my time. That's not my reading interest."
3,It was okay,"One of her earlier books, certainly not her best but it was an enjoyable read. Too much romance and not enough mystery"
3,Was an OK book,The story was a little far fetched in many ways and pretty easy to know ahead of time what would happen
2,Too much romance,"As a Lisa Jackson fan,I know she has written better. Too much romance in this one. Maybe the ladies will like it better than I did."
2,Twist,"This book has a lot of twists to it. I enjoyed it very much, even though thought the the book ended to fast I would and probably will read it again"
5,Awesome book! Hard to put it down.,"This was a page turner with solid build up, twiching plot and good attention to the ending. This book will not disappoint fans of Lisa Jackson."
3,This one deserves a better DVD transfer,"Anthony Hopkins has made many made-for-TV movies, and this is one of them.And it's better than most.However, DirectSource's video transfer is grainy at best--my copy even jumps forward to the next ""chapter"" before the end of the previous one! Hardly what I like to find in a DVD. (Therefore the rating of 3 stars instead of what otherwise would rate a 4 or even 4 and a half.)If you're looking for a watchable version of this one on DVD, it will ""do,"" since the subject matter is good enough to hold one's attention. However, if you like your movies presented with a decent image quality, don't spend your money on this one.I can only hope a DVD edition with better picture resolution than this one (the only one available at the moment) becomes available in the future!"
5,Expansion plus graphic improvement,"Everyone is appropriately writing about the great increases in warriors, lands, etc. Totally agree, but don't also overlook the graphic improvement. While AofE II already had AWESOME graphics, the expansion disk has tweaked this and made it even more beautiful, lifelike. AofE is the BEST game."
5,"Like Age Of Kings, But Way Better!","My 9-year-old grandson said this about the gift he received from us: ""If I could give this 8 stars, I'd give this 8 stars! It is like Age of Kings except it has much better campaigns and has much more to offer. It has better graphics and more men to choose from in your army. It is an exhilarating game! And if you have Age of Kings and you think it's good.... I recommend you buy this quickly!"" (great review, Jimmy!)"
5,An awsome expnasion pack laoded with goodies,"The x-pack adds 5 new civilizations, awsome new units and technologies, fixes many bugs and balances the game betetr overall in Random Map play. In DM Koreans seem to be a little strong, kind of like hitites in aok, if done right by an expert you can't beat them but overall in team play you see many civilizations including turks, goths, koreans, spanish, franks, huns, britons, and celts."
4,"Not too much to add, but still worth it!","This expansion is just that. The features it adds (new cultures and techs) will seem random to the new or infrequent player. However, if you let yourself learn AOEII, then Conquerors is worth all the money.Graphics: 4/5 No upgrade hereGameplay: 5/5 The Techs and Cultures it adds keep the game goingControls: 4/5 No upgrade hereTech Tree: 5/5 Niche add-ons helpStory: 4/5 A simple Microsoft campaign, but it's the thought that counts.Overall: 4/5 Not too much to add, but every gain helps."
5,The Greatest War Game I've Ever Played!,"Even though Age of Empires does not have civilizations such as the Romans, I loved slaying my enemy day after day! I've had it for about two months now, and I got very good at it. It controls sort of like the Command and Conquer series. It's even better than C&C: Red Alert! I recomend it to everyone! Even though it is rated T for teen. The only remotly violent thing you see is a little skeleton once you killed some one!"
5,Good gameplay upgrades,Worth the upgrade just for the improved functionality. Scenarios are a great history lesson as well.
4,"brand new, you're retro","Bass, guitar, drum, vocals. It's been a dependable formula for the past 45 years. The Bishops debut is a nice addition to the rock and roll canon.The song writing and production here are distinctly retro, particularly the flat, rubber band sound of the bass. It reminds me of The Jam and any number of mods/garage bands from the sixties.Can't Stand It Anymore, Life in a Hole and So High are the stand out tracks for me, but there aren't any real duds among the 14.If three-minute guitar pop songs are your thing you won't be disappointed."
4,Good value,"Just right for modest trail rides. There is enough room in the zippered pouch for a map and lunches for two. The plastic bottles and elastic bands which hold them in are of mediocre quality, but good enough. The saddlebag itself seems durable. Very easy to snap on to the back of my Aussie saddle, and I would buy it again."
3,Buggy game: good single player; so-so multiplayer,"This game can be a lot of fun -- as a single player game. The multiplayer game is very buggy, even with the top of the line system. Both the Zone and Gamespy Arcade have failed to adequately address the drop and memory suck issues. Hopefully a patch will come forward, however until that does I suggest you avoid this game as a multiplayer platform."
3,NOT A FLIGHT SIM...,"Everyone is mentioning it, but no one seems to be bothered by it. The lack of physics while flying is VERY noticeable. Fly sideways, you should pull to that side and fall. Not here. While this makes it more ""Fantasy like"", if you're used to true flight sims, it'll take you a while to get used to flying here. I was disappointed by this more than anyone else though, it seems. Oh, and flying faster seems to improve maneuverability, rather than the typical slowing down for tighter turns.The planes look great. The graphics are good. I loved getting to blast at a zepplin. My feeling is, someone needs to make a true flight sim like this, and have the top speeds, physics, and flight more realistic. Keep the zepplin aircraft carriers, and the awsome plane designs, and the graphics though."
4,If the Beta version is any indication.....,"Playing the Beta version of Crimson Skies from Microsoft has been an adventure. While the game is still not quite finished, it is already a blast, as long as you don't mind the lack of physics when flying. The graphics, sound, and characters/images are amazing, and the music is right on. Will the real version of the game be better? Absolutely, and I can't wait!"
5,"Really fun to play, no stability problems here","I was adicted to this game for months until I won it.I run an athlon 950, geforce2, hercules soundcard. No problems here. I got the patches from MS.I hope there is a sequel."
4,ONLINE FLIGHT GAMES SHOULD BE LIKE THIS,ITS NOT TO REAL OR TO FAKE IT IS JUST RIGHT A COMBO OF FUN AND SHOOTING AND ONLINE PLAY. THE SPECS ARE GOOD MY PC RUNS IT WITH NO PROBLEMS BUT I RUN A P3 1GHZ GEFORCE 2 ULTRA 64MB AND IT PLAYS AWESOME THATS ALL I GOT TO SAY
4,very good fun while it lasts.,"crimson skies is a fun,fantastic adventure like those old movies that your dad watched. the story is good, the planes are fast, and the girls are cute. the only down side is that the d word is used twice,and some one tells the villen to go to hell. thats about it. if you dont have a problem with that,then get this game NOW!"
4,Addictive and Great looking,"This game has caught my attention for a while. it is well paced and has stunning graphics if your system can run them smoothly. The only downside I've seen is that you can't choose your own mission, the game does it for you and it's always the same sequence of events."
5,The Best,"I own a copy of this book. It's very well written, easy to understand, make learning shading language an ease. Wish the author will continue to write more books :)"
2,clear,"description states ""clear label"" - this item is not as clear as one might hope for / label was disapointing"
3,"Entertaining, but lacking important key info.","Photos, illustrations and stories are great. But I found the overall book lacking in one key area: Maps to show you where these places are located. Or even where some of the cities are located. Very fun book but but I felt I wanted more info. with greater detail."
5,great travel book for those weekend california getaways!,Perfect solution for weekend getaways if you live in or near California. Can't wait to start traveling to some of these cool places. Very well written with outstanding photography.
3,Entertaining but lacking a map,"As others have stated, the one big thing lacking in this book is a map. It would be much more convenient if there was an overall map citing the locations of places described in the book so you could easily see what weirdness is near you to explore. Even a simple index by county would be more useful than nothing. I can't speak to the fact checking, but it is an entertaining read."
3,Emily/L.M.'s Quest?,"Emily's Quest seems often to be telling two stories at once, in two different styles. Emily's relationships with Teddy Kent and Dean Priest often play out like conventional magazine romance of the time. This can get frustrating, particularly in the latter half of the book. However, Emily's continuing adventures as a writer and her from-the-heart journal entries are pure gold, and have the feel of L.M. Montgomery's own experience.This book does have a bittersweet flavor that is missing from the Anne series, but I appreciate the emotional truth that comes through. Montgomery's insight into her characters is clear but gentle, and rarely unforgiving. My only wish is that she would have trusted her characters to forward Emily's story to the end without resorting to plot devices. Overall, however, this is a worthwhile read that fans of Emily Climbs will not want to miss."
5,A wonderful read,"First, its unfair to compare Anne and Emily. Both are different types of characters. Anne, for me, shines through because I recognize a sort of ""bubbling-with-life"" about the character which is absolutely enchanting. Emily is not lively like Anne - but a more sedate yet an equally lovable creation. Again, I consider ""Emily climbs"" to be superior to this one - but I do not think we could have done without this sequel. The romance element had to more pronounced here than the others in the series. This does take a bit of the shine off, but there is not a moment when you want to keep the book down. It keeps you engrossed right through. And LMM's beauty of langauage enchants you continuously. The finale is well handled, and it was about time too !! On the whole this is a must read for any book lover - as all LMM's books are."
4,A satisfying conclusion to Emily's story...,"The third and final book about young orphan Emily Byrd Starr focuses upon her struggle to establish herself as an author -- and her overall place as an adult woman. Childhood friend Ilse Burnley is planning her wedding to Teddy Kent, the young artist with whom Emily had established a soulmate connection as soon as she moved to New Moon at age 10. Meanwhile, neither Emily's ambition-filled friend Perry Miller nor the eccentric scholar Dean Priest have ever stopped asking Emily to marry them. How did everyone's emotions and intentions get so mixed up?Then a terrible accident complicates matters further, and during her long convalescence, Emily begins to seriously wonder what she really wants in life -- and what she's willing to do to set things right.This book is a beautiful conclusion to a classic trilogy about a very memorable young heroine."
5,A very satisfying book!,"Emily's Quest is an excellent conclusion to the Emily trilogy. I have read the others, but they just don't have the power to move you as much as this book did. The previous books are more light and happy, but this is my favorite! It is not too sad, it is just right. I was surprised that I felt every feeling of Emily's as I read the book. When Emily was sad, I was sad and when Emily was happy, I was very happy!This is an amazing book that you won't want to miss! Of course, I would suggest reading the first two books before this one to get the background and to understand Emily more. Anyone who liked the Anne series will like this book. I don't know, but maybe I liked this book more than any Anne book, just maybe. I recommmend this to people ages 13 and up (to 113). It is a very satisfying book that will lewave you feeling happy (At least that's what I thought). :)"
3,"Just Tedious, Boring, and Lacks Excitement!","If you really love Lucy Maude Montgomery novels, you will love her Emily series as well but I found it to be really boring and I tried to get into it. First, there is just too much information in details which doesn't help visualize the time period. Second, a map might be useful in helping readers become more familiar with Prince Edward Island. Third, the writing is so much at times. There are times when she writes like it's a diary or journal or there is a narrator. There doesn't seem to be a focused, concise, and clear storyline as Emily progresses as an adult from a child. She dreams to be a writer but yet I find the writing here boring and tedious overall. There is a lot of repetition and lack of clarity."
3,<--and a half,"Personally, perhaps because I loved the imaginative and spunky Emily of the first two books, I was fairly disapointed with how dry and boring this was. Of course it had many life lessons about patience, loneliness, and that things don't always go your way, but it lost lots of its flavor that Lucy Maud Montgomery had in the first two. I love her books, all except this one. The ending, I must say, was certainly worth the disapointment found, yet I cannot give more than three and a half for a book I dreaded reading."
5,Simple handbook intended for the general reader and student,"Expertly compiled and organized by the Gallaudet University Press editorial staff, 1,000 Signs Of Life: Basic ASL For Everyday Conversation is a simple handbook intended for the general reader and student. Simple black-and-white illustrations clearly show 1,000 signs that can be learned quickly and used to communicate with anyone who is familiar with American Sign Language. Organized alphabetically in 17 categories, the common signs covered include those for animals, food, clothes, people, health, body, days of the week, transportation, holidays, religion, thoughts, emotions, and many more of solid practical use. A superb reference, self-teaching, and vocabulary building guide, especially for those new to ASL."
3,illustrations are hard to understand,"I am disappointed with this book. While it does cover many everyday words in ASL, the illustrations are not of a good quality. I find anything by Garlic Press to be much clearer. It would have been very helpful if there was verbage describing how to make the sign-then the drawings would have made more sense. This is probobly a good book if you already know ASL and just need a reminder. Otherwise, look for Garlic Press flash cards and books, especially if you are just looking for single words(not to have a conversation)."
4,God Bless John Mellencamp!,"A few years back, I drooled when I heard that John Mellencamp was booked to play an outdoor show here in St. John's, Newfoundland ... but alas he had a heart attack and had to cancel ... Luckily, for the lovers of his music, he is still in the game and still a ""s__t disturber""!! Lonesome Jubilee & Scarecrow are two of his very best, signposts on the road that was the 80's. These albums make me want to take road trip thru America's heartland! Have always said, that my fantasy concert would include, John Mellencamp, Steve Earle, Canadian country-rockers Blue Rodeo and local Nfld. group Dead Reckoning ... what a show!! Ah, maybe someday I'll get to see Mr. Mellencamp perform live ... until then I guess the CD's will have to do!"
3,The Lonesome Overreaching,"When this album first appeared I was bowled over by the sound - a mix of accordion, fiddle, and Appalachian music. It was beautiful. But soon the lyrics get in the way. I admire the sentiments, but the lyrical execution is awkward and embarassing. ""Check It Out"" and ""Paper in Fire"" somewhat redeem it, but I think Big Daddy (his best album IMHO) mines the same territory with much better results."
5,An Instant Classic,"John Cougar Mellencamp knows how to make music. He rocks the house with ""Hotdogs and Hamburgers."" Opens his insides on ""Check It Out."" And you'll never forget the infamous ""Paper In Fire."" Sit back, pop it in, and prepare to be amazed."
4,A Winner,"This CD is wonderful. It it John Cougar Mellencamp at his finest singing about Americana at its finest. Certainly a classic. The songs flow together tremendously well -- so well I cannot remember which songs on this disc were ""hits"", since they are all ""hits"" with me. ""Check It Out"", ""The Real Life"", ""We Are The People"", and ""Hard Times For An Honest Man"" are all great. Plus, how can you not like a song called ""Rooty Toot Toot""! Great CD choice."
3,Simply Money Y2K Fix,I have been a user of the Simply Money for six years. I agree with other comments already made. The programme is easy to use but needs updating as some of the functions such as transferring between accounts shows the year as 1900 instead of 2000. If this could be fixed I would have no hesitation in recommending it to new computer users because of its simplicity. I have not been able to establish who has the ownership of the programme. Incidently the version being offered is suitable for windows 98.
4,Great Band,"The first time I heard this band was live in the Cayman Islands. They played every night at the hotel I was staying at. They are great live, and great on CD. This is well worth the buy."
5,Timeless Classic,"This book was given to my father as a birthday present from my mother when I was a small boy and I'm pretty sure it received scant attention from my father (an ex-WW2 navy man) and sat on the shelf until I was in my very early teens in the sixties. Well it certainly was in constant use from then on. I think I read it every year until I was almost in my twenties and I've read it a couple of times since then and will probably again.For anybody interested in aircraft stories, as I am, or just interested in a fine read, this is the book for you. No fiction writer would dare write this story as it is so unlikely and yet it's all true.Thrilling, inspiring, funny, tragic, it's a story a man's unbending determination and being in the right place at the right time.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in a good read."
5,Bravery Undiminished !,"I was in my early twenties when I first read this classic tale by Paul Brickhill about Britain's WWII R.A.F. ""legless,"" ace-fighter pilot. In re-reading the book many times since, I can sense and feel the heroic determination of Bader and the pilots of the squadrons that he led. If any reader wishes to know why Winston Churchill was moved to perpetuate the heroism of these men in his famous, ""Their Finest Hour,"" speech, this is indeed the book to read."
5,GREAT VALUE!,These chairs are very well constructed. Very nice material on the seats. The wood was a little too red for my taste but the price was too good to pass up. Delivery was quick and everything was in excellent condition. Extremely easy to assemble!
1,SENT WRONG COSTUME,"I ordered the Adult's Orphan Annie Costume (Size:Large 11-13),but was sent the CHILD'S large by mistake. after slitting the sleeves i can just barely get into the annie costume zipping it all the way up. since i altered the costume, i can't return it, but i can wear it as a top with a red skirt of mine, and i also have a white belt i can use as the belt it came with was useless, being too small. i like the peter pan collar though!"
4,"Pretty, but small","The stones in these earrings are rather small. I guess I should have expected that for the price. They are very pretty, however. I like them because I can wear them with so many outfits! I also bought the matching necklace. I was NOT impressed with the necklace. I honestly don't know who the manufacturer had in mind when they selected the chain for the pendant. It was so small (short) that I seriously doubt if anyone beyond the age of 10 could wear it! I showed it to a friend and she said that her daughter (who is quite petite) couldn't wear a chain that short! But, we're rating the earrings. They are lightweight and not too ""garish"". I believe that they could be worn with casual or more dressy outfits. The stones are small, but perhaps I should say ""subtle"". Very understated!"
2,Disappointment,I bought these for $12 which I thought was such a good price. I gave them to my daughter in law and a week later she gave them back in a zip lock. Three stones had fallen off. I fixed them and gave them back. A week later three more stones had fallen off. They are not made well at all.
5,Gorgeous exotic light weight dangling pierced earrings,"I really loved these earrings. They can be worn with just about any color outfit. They are extremely lightweight. And the price is low! I loved them so much, that I bought a pair for my sister."
3,cheap cheap cheap,"what a fool am I. Already one 'stone' from each earring has dropped off...and those 'stones' look suspiciously like plastic. they are so small and my eyes are so old that I can't tell for sure! I do wear the earrings; but, be warned, they are not worth what you're paying!"
2,"Short on insight, long on useless detail","I read a lot on cartography, particularly cartographic history, and I was excited to get this book. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. It has masses of carto-bibliographical detail, not put to much use in supporting a broader argument. And it is very short on any insight or analysis beyond the most superficial and obvious. Historical maps reflect the concerns and attitudes of the times and cultures in which they were produced - I didn't need to wade through this book to know that. This book could be useful for reference, but it won't deepen your understanding."
3,Came really fast...but with a huge flaw in the leather,It was delivered really fast...but with a huge flaw in the leather which i had to repair myself.
3,"Very nice, perfect for new kids, but not made well","I purchased one for us, and one for my parents. Both had issues with the wheels & legs breaking off. My parents renailed the bottom and two legs, and superglued wheels, been working fine for last couple of years. We has to take all the legs and wheels off, so now sits on the floor in kid area, and they like to jump and play on it, perfect height for them., looks expensive and very big, pefect as cocktail table, just use trays. and sitting is comfortable."
3,where's scarlet's story?,"WONDERFUL versions of Sorta Fairytale, and Operation Peter Pan was beautiful. I wondered where track 4, scarlett's story went though. I was really looking forward to listening to it. It is alright, though. I guess it was an artistic statement/"
3,pretty good single,"pretty good, as far as singles go. the two edits of a sorta fairytale sound pretty similar, but the operation peter pan b-side is worth the money. the multimedia track is nothing special (they usually aren't), but die-hard fans will, as usual, pick this one up anyway..."
1,It's a good book BUT,"This is a great book but not if, like me, you want to know 'why?'. If you're a professional and you're moving to FCP from using some other professional editing software then this is probably the book you need. But if you need to learn about FCP from the ground up then try the Revolutionary Final Cut Pro 3 book. It starts at the basics and tells you why you'd do something and explains it the way that I like."
3,Worthwhile book,"I knew final cut pro fairly well when I started the tutorials, so I wasn't sure how much more I would learn. But I did learn more. I learned tricks to be more efficient, and now know more techiniques and shortcuts. So it was worth the time spent reading, in time saved later.Many chapter are dedicated to non-editing stuff, like titling and compositing, which he explains are now important for editors to know. Another reviewer or 2 seemed to think the author was a poor teacher, I didn't seem to have a problem with the text, which was generally well written and logically presented."
1,Carriere Perfume,This product was watered down and doesn't smell like it does in department stores. I guess I shouldn't have expected to get it for 1/3 the price and have it meet my expectations.
3,A farewell.,"The power pop trio's farewell. A bittersweet event all around, from the parting shot to the unevenness and potential found within."
4,Outstanding blues guitar,This is a classic valedictory effort from the Cream trio. This kind of heavy blues is not to everybody's taste of course but if you want some samples of early Clatpton soloing just listen to Politician and Sitting on Top of the World - guitar playing of subtle distinction.
4,Not bad for a contractual obligation album,"Cream/ Goodbye: Cream created this odds and sods album to satisfy a contractual obligation which explains its severely disjointed nature. We have heard ""I'm so Glad"", ""Politician"" and ""Sitting on Top of The World"" before, but these are good alternative live versions. Here we get the studio version of ""Badge"". Then we get ""Doing that Scrapyard Thing"" which sounds like the kind of pop single we would become used to from other groups in the mid 1970's. ""What a Bringdown"" ends the regular album nicely. The old CD I have (which may not be available anymore) added a seventh cut of ""Anyone for Tennis"".This is a frustrating album in many ways. We expected more than this, however, what is actually ON the album isn't bad. It (barely) rates four stars."
2,very disappointing,"Cream announced their break up and had a contract for a final album.Each member agreed to write one new song and the rest of the CD would be live.Clapton wrote Badge along with George Harrison for this album.Infact looking back Harrison along with Ringo Starr wrote the lions share of this song. It features classic George Harrision style guitar.Doing that scrapyard thing was added by Jack Bruce and to this day does nothing for me.Baker does the song What A Bringdown. In my mind Baker was talking about this album.The live side is very solid with three great live songs that show Cream in top form. The songs are Politician, I'm so Glad and Sitting on top of the World.This is not their best CD, but is worth purchasing if for nothing else but Badge and the live music"
2,What a Bringdown!!,"This supergroup recorded two (mainly) studio albums,FRESH CREAM,and DISRAELI GEARS, and then a studio/live mix WHEELS ON FIRE. When these three recordings came out over a generation ago, I played them endlessly, and like many another aspiring lead guitarist, listened and played with them on a regular basis. GOODBYE, the fourth, was a major disapointment. The trio's fresh exuburance seemed to evaporate with noisy,jumbled live performances of songs I already knew, just another jam session. Other than ""Badge"", it offered almost nothing, and ""Badge"" didn't compare with the clean, fresh sounds of before. Make this your last Cream purchase, only after you've tasted the great earlier albums. Oh yes, the Broadway song and dance look of the cover still seems a little strange."
2,GoodBye To All This!,"The live cuts here seem just a little out of kilter, a little out of tune, a little tired ... they were together slightly more than two years - but in that time period it was near-nonstop touring, and the insanity of life under a microscope as they achieved rock immortality. It must have been exhausting (the photo on the cover says it all). The studio cuts seems like after thoughts.(any other band would rate 4 stars if they put out music like this)"
1,One star for one good song,"Cream had a few good tunes. A very few. Avoid this album at all costs. ""Badge"" is the only bright spot on an album from a band that was filled with nauseating musical indulgence and bad singing. ""Badge"" would be better on Eric Clapton's first solo album or a collection of Cream. At least with the later you get a few other tolerable songs by this band. Goodbye and good riddence to this CD."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"There are 2 or 3 very good tracks on this CD but the rest are a bit too long, loud, and repetitious for my taste. Probably someone younger than I would enjoy them more! I didn't realize this while actually watching the movie, unfortuately!"
5,TOUGH TOE PRO,"GOOD STUFF, EXTENDS THE LIFE OF PITCHING SHOES. WE WERE BUYING TWO PAIR OF SHOESA SEASON, NOW MY DAUGHTER IS STARTING A SECOND SEASON WITH THE SHOES SHE HAD LAST YEAR. NO MORE TEARING OUT THE TOE AND SIDES."
4,It took a while for it to grow on me,"It took a while but now I love Dru Hill's first cd. I never heard ""Love's Train"" until they sang it. They do it better than Con Funk Shun!!! If you don't have this cd, buy it and let it grow on you."
4,GOOD ALBUM!!!!,"this was their first album, awesome in almost everyway from ""April Showers"" to ""So Special"" overall damn good album i could not help but buy it again"
1,Let down in Dallas,Very disappointed because the item ordered was never received. The seller never contacted me one way or the other. Not happy because I waited almost a month for my merchandise. Ended up having to order a second time.
5,cool,i love music ... great price fast shipping it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..
4,"Well made, fit like they should.",Pants are well made and fit quite well. Sizes were correct and matched what they were supposed to be. Like any good jean they are a bit stiff until washed a few times.
4,nice soft and nice fit black jeans,The Lee jeans are the best for my big self. recommended. I liked well enough to get a second pair which are the same
3,ordering problem,"the jeans were probably okay, but there was a problem with the order--the wrong size was shipped, with no information on how to straighten out the confusion--no phone number or website, just a return form; I used the form to send back the jeans, but still had to pay for shipping both ways, which seemed wrong to me...so I will not be ordering from this site again."
2,Get what you pay for,"What was I thinking buying Lee? Maybe it was the price. The right size. Must have been out of my mind.These jeans, if they can be called jeans, are cheap and flimsy compared to Levis. I work in the field and industrial environments and these jeans just didn't hold up. From the odd pocket designs to the absurd Lee logo which serves as a belt loop to the flimsy quality of the denim (i hope it is denim), these jeans have been epic failures all around.I would have rated them lower but they, technically, still function to protect my legs.Results of wearing these jeans into the field? Holes, tears, snags, and rips. They might be ok for casual wear...but if you are looking for a high-quality pair of jeans that will last, look elsewhere."
3,Okay jeans,"Okay jeans, kind of big in the legs for my husband and a little longer than usual for the size we ordered, but in general, okay for big man's jeans."
5,Blue Jeans,"The jeans are inexpensive, well made, and wer delivered promptly. That is all anyone could ask for."
5,No more searching from store to store!,"Great deal, great jeans & I should have bought the jeans this way in the 1st place instead of going from store 2 store!"
2,Small sizing,"These are enough smaller than other 52w jeans I wear on a daily basis that I can't zip them. The smaller size may be what Lee means by regular fit, but it still renders them unwearable in my case. Live and learn I guess."
4,Lee Jeans,"Good quality pants, very comfortable. Seem to run a little big in size. Recommended for casual or informal dress affairs."
4,Maddeningly peppered with errors but indispensable,"Where to begin on the errors that have propagated through so many revisions? Equations are incorrectly referenced in the text some figures have problems. See fig 8.30, p513 5th revision where the curves Xopt and Yopt appear to be switched for just one example. The best part about the book is the summary of materials and the references, which you often need.My personal note to Mr. Koechner: Dear kind sir, please publish errata for this book. I mean no disrespect, it is the best reference of its kind. However, it could be improved substantially."
5,Kick ass pop,"Show World is a Redd Kross achievement and a treasure for the rock world. Top notch production, full spectrum arrangements, catchy hooks backed by kick ass riffs, vocal harmonic power, simple - yet at times, deep - themes, and genuine coolness make this my favorite lp of all time."
4,Life Improvement,"I bought these as a gift for a buddy who, as a result of intense radiation therapy for brain cancer, had significant hearing loss that the doctors said was ""normal"" and would diminish over time but would never completely return to normal. No insurance and the inability to work prevent the purchase of ""real"" hearing aids so i thought it was worth a try. They have improved his quality of life and work like a charm."
2,Difficult to use,This product is very small. It was extremely difficult to open the tiny battery space and insert the battery. The switch to turn it on is also very small. You need excellent dexterity to use this product. It is not designed for most elderly.
1,Defective Product,Both of these ear buds immediately started a high pitched tone as soon as I tried to use them. You have to move the product around to make it stop but why should it be like this? I only found one or two positions where the tone stopped. it is so loud other people can hear it. No type of adjustment seemed to make any difference. Useless devices. I did not expect much but still feel i was taken.
2,not full stories,"I did not realize this was just a sampler. I, myself, haven't read it but my kids tell me there are no full stories"
1,not famous/ not good,"These aren't famous stories. they aren't even good stories if you're reading in 2013. If you're sitting somewhere in the eighteenth century reading to puritan children, then this is the book for you."
4,Children stories,This book listed many stories that most kids should know. The book had stories in it that I didn't know about. I found the stories very different and interesting. I would recommend this book to others that are involved with children.
2,Made In China,"The good news is the web site is easy to use, the order was shipped promptly and was accurate. Bad news is the bubble envelopes are supposed to be # 0 in size; Maybe they are technically, but they are smaller than the other # O envelopes I have bought and I can not fit as much in them. I bought one box to try it because the price was good and shipping was included; they are made in China and I have a thing about many items made there. I am often unimpressed with quality control or quality of product in general. Unfortunately, these bubble mailers are not an exception to the rule.I will stick with my current supplier and pay a bit more."
1,TERRIBLE product. USELESS,"These are awful. I had purchased before and LOVED them, but this time they came and were different. They are a lighter color and have a longer flap for sealing. The bubbles are not as thick, and worst of all, they DON'T STAY SEALED! I packaged a bunch of these up a day or so ago, and today I find that all of the flaps have come undone! I am SO glad I didn't go ahead and mail them before checking!! I will NEVER buy these again, they are USELESS."
1,Not the right size.,"These envelopes are a little thin--both the paper and bubble wrap.Probably not a huge problem, but it won't surprise me if a few of them don't ship intact.My main concern though is that they're smaller than the usual 6 x 9 envelopes I buy.Not a huge issue there either, but I paid extra to get something slightly roomier--and now have something even tighter.On the 6"" inch side, they're close. But, the only way they reach 10 is if you're counting the flap that folds over. And that seems like a silly way to measure."
2,Economy,"This is the most used size for my needs, I ship about 100 packages a week. I was paying a little more for mailers elsewhere so I thought I'd give these a try because they would save me a little. They work but I would not consider them to be a quality product. They're thinner and have less padding than what I was using. I will be switching back to the other ones I was using (ULine)."
3,A bit too stiff!,"I ship CDs for the chorale I sing with, and ordered these padded envelopes for that purpose. Our CDs are packed in nice sturdy cases (thicker than jewel cases) and I find these envelopes really stiff compared to the ones I used previously, and sometimes I have trouble inserting the CD into the envelope."
3,Adhesive,"These envelopes have an off center adhesive, making it necesary to tape one down one side. It may be that this batch was from a bad run."
2,too small,"Inside dimensions are smaller than the measurements seem. They took the product back and refunded my money. They said I needed the #1 envelopes, which I ordered. They are fine. I need to mail out my paperback book to those who order (Baltho, The Dog Who Owned a Man)."
5,"Quality product, great price, fast delivery!",I purchased 250 Ecolite Kraft Bubble Mailers from California Office Supply. The product is good quality and the shipping was fast. Highly recommend both the product and the supplier.
3,Size of Mailer,"Dimensions described as 6.5"" x 9"" which would have worked better for me. I was disappointed that it is really a 6"" x 9"" which limits my use for more items I have that require that additional 1/2"" opening."
2,slightly defective,My order came with half to one inch tear/cut in one side of the flap end. Too late to return. Have to tape each package. I like the size and performance in all other respects. Arrived quickly.
1,Too small for DVDs.,These envelopes are too small for shipping DVDs. They are not 6X10. They are 6X9 with little play in them.
2,NOT Ecolite Mailer as Advertised!!,"I specifically ordered this product because it said Ecolite #0 6"" x 10 ""mailer and showed the Ecolite logo in the photos. What I received is not Ecolite. It is a substitute, CPI Packaging. They are decent weight and all but not as large as an Ecolite #0. The specific box I need to fit in this mailer tears the mailer because it is too small. This same box fits nicely in an Ecolite #0. Beware, these are a small 6"" x 10""!Really disappointed, I'd return, but I can use for other items, just not what I bought them for. Now I have to place another order somewhere else to get the right ones!"
1,Do not buy from Valuemailers! Not 6X10 but 6.25 x 9.25,"Valuemailers advertised false item. The measurement for this item is totally wrong. It's wider (6.25"") and shorter (9.25"") and not standard Kraft #0 6 x 10. Beware they will ask you to ship the item back on your expenses and refund less the shipping you paid. The only true compatible Kraft #0 6 x 10 is made by CPI Packaging Value-lite mailer. You can find it from theboxery.com. Not many vendors carry the true 6x10 quality mailers."
4,Arrived Fast. Looks Good :-),"Cost is a little bit high, but works well :-) They also look good. Might buy it again some day. :-)"
1,THIS WAS NOT WHAT WAS ORDERED,This is the second time I have ordered form this company. The first time they sent me the craft mailers as advertised. The second time they sent me mailers from a company called 'CPI'.THESE MAILERS ARE SMALLER THAN THE KRAFT. ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK.
5,Sturdy and nice,These envelopes were inexpensive and has very nice quality. They are sturdy with plenty of padding. I have used these for different products from small metal ashtrays to small porcelain figurines (with extra bubble wrap then of course)
1,Mailer not wide enough for most video games and DVDs,"Avoid these mailers if you ship DVDs or video games. The width of the mailer is too short, resulting in the need to forcefully push the DVD or game into the envelope. It shouldn't have to be that difficult."
4,Well Made Bubble Mailer with Good Self Sealing,Sturdy mailing for sending hardcover books and other similar sized objects. The self sealing strip is quite good. Provides adequate protection although I would not send anything of significant value that I wanted to arrive in pristine shape in this type of mailer.Good for everyday use.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE !!!,"Too bad there is no half star...These are definitely not authentic quality ""Kraft"" bubble mailers.Cheap knock-offs that will not provide any protection and leave no room for adding your own. AVOID."
2,Easily rip and won't be ordering this brand again,"I ordered 250 of these mailers and I'm regretting that I did. The envelopes aren't as well made as the ones I bought previous on Amazon. They're flimsier and easily rip. I use them to mail DVDs and the cases sometimes cause the evelopes to start to rip and it's apparent they aren't as high of a quality as the envelopes I've used in the past. I also have to bend them and form them a little before putting anything inside to ""loosen"" them up a bit for the product I'm mailing. I'm disappointed."
4,"Great Product, Delayed Shipping","You'd be hard-pressed to find a better value for anything. These mailers are high quality at a ridiculously low price. My only complaint was it took over a week for the shipping, though they were nice when I contacted them about it. All told, I'm happy with the product."
2,not so pleased,"The envelopes were a disappointment. I have ordered this type of envelope before from another company and the quality with the other company was soooo much better. the amazon envelopes are cheap in comparison. I also ordered them expedited and paid an additional fee for faster delivery. I was promised 1-3 days. They showed up in 2 weeks. do not recommend product or paying for fast shipping. Normally I love ordering from Amazon...they do a great job..however, they used an outside source that was a complete disappointment."
2,Not much protection,The bubbles are relatively flat and the package somewhat flimsy--definitely have seen better on Amazon for the same price. Lose about an inch of the packaging because the bubbles at the top are all but flat. Adhesive is decent.Will not purchase again.
5,Quality.....as expected,"I LOVE this belt. I was a little concerned before I received it thatit might not fit. I have a 30"" waist, but the belt itself has ampleadjustments. And as for the pouches, sturdy, roomy without beingbulky and a place for everything! I couldn't be more pleased withthe quality or the functionality of everything about this tool belt."
3,dissappointing,"Ok first the good. These bags have lots of pockets for all your tools and fastners.Now the bad.. the bags are tooo heavy, at least if your work every day using them fully tooled-up. The clips on the sides are completely useless (milwaukee.. what are you thinking???) The hardware appears cheap (only time will tell)The suspender attachments are crummy and dont stay in place when you strap they slip of before you can get buckled in.( they need velcro so they will not slip)I image that because they are so heavy they will last awhile but try wearing them all day in the sun in 85 degree heat. You'll se what I mean!In conclusion I would say these are great for the home owner weekend carpenter, but not for the professioanl by any means."
1,Where's the pencils slots?,"Being a carpenter for 28 yrs now. My trusty pouch of 10 yrs has failed. Only need the left side but can't find same brand. Sure this system has alot of pouches but no place for pencils, nailsets or my knife. I'm right handed, so, my knife is on the right as are my pencils. No little slot for them on either pouch. And whats with all the hammer holsters. Also, whats with 2 tape slot holders. Never in my 28 yrs have I seen a carpenter use a tape slot to hold their tape. The clips break, I use a tape pouch, much easier to get in and out. So I'm returning it today and restart my search for a new pouch system."
4,"bulky , but nice....","I've had my belt for about 2 months, now, and I have to say ........ I really like it. Personally , I tend to wear a tool bag as little as possible, but I need access to a lot of different tools, and am usually forced to put this on to keep track of tools.One of the first things I did was to take the belt to a shoe repair shop. I found that the suspender hooks don't work well sitting off to the sides of the pouches, so I had the repair guy sew them onto the face ( one on the face, one on the back ) of the pouches to hold the load with better balance. This worked like a charm, and the belt feels much more balanced now ( for $18...).Only time will tell how the pouches hold up to wear and tear, but so far, no tears in the fabric. There are lots of little hidden pockets and slots and I give the manufacturer credit for making the bags loose on the belt, so they can be positioned to one's liking."
3,A sequel to Piemur's book,"This book has a full fledged female villain: Lady Thellaand her band of thieves. As Thred falls for the first timein this era the displaced people have gathered arounda leader and begun to steal to stay alive.Most of the last half of the book deals with the southern continentwhich has the imaginative name : 'Southern'.We get a parallel to the adventures of Piemurand at last Archaeology of the first settlementof the planet with a computer still active.The result leaves things open for another sequelto follow?As I have read several in this sequence I think thiseffort doesn't have the spirit of some of the originalwork, but continues the development of the Pernculture from another point of view."
5,"A wonderful link between ""White Dragon"" and ""All the Weyrs""","Anne McCaffery's ""Renegades"" is a perfect link between ""The White Dragon"" and ""All the Weyrs of Pern."" An added feature is Sharra's side of ""Dragondrums"" and the history of Pern as seen from the Holdless-honest and dishonest alike. Add to that a cover by Michael Whelan and you have a perfect gift for any Pern fan anywhere."
4,The Dark Side of Pern,"I always wondered where the 'bad guys' were on Pern. In that regard, it's quite refreshing to find that there are in fact truly unsavory characters abounding the planet. Lord Fax aside, Thella is the most ruthless, evil character of McCaffrey's tales. Read this to fill in knowledge of Pern and the Dragonriders Series as a change of pace. Like 'All the Weyrs', which this is a prerequisite to reading, this is only another good book. Within the context of the larger whole, a worthwhile read."
5,Very Good,"I loved this book. At first it is a little bit confusing, but if you read it over, the plot as a whole gets better, and you will love it! The book is very well written and organized. I think that this book is a must-read. I have not read the other Pern series books, but I have read The Renegades of Pern, and I am now hooked on the whole series. This book is excellent! :^)"
1,Couldn't keep track of the characters,"I read the first couple of Pern books and loved them. Later I tried this one. The first 18 pages introduced 11 SETS of characters in different locations, totally unrelated to each other. I ended up writing them down and still couldn't keep them straight. I therefore hardly got attached, and didn't really care what happened to them. There were so many plot lines that I had no idea what the story was. Finally, at page 265, with only 120 to go, and at the end of a chapter no less, I finally gave up.Try ""Dragonflight"" instead."
2,Renegades of Pern,"I have ready the all the books in the Pern series and find this one to be the weakest of them all. It was harder than most to follow and the feeling of satisfaction that I normally experience at the end of the book was missing. Somehow it was just not up to Anne McCaffrey's normal standard. It is still a worthwhile read as it explains some of the actions of Dragons, Riders, Harpers, Lord Holders, other Crafters and the ""Holdless"" which occur in the other novels of the series."
3,"Get to the point, already","Not a bad book, per se, but I for one expected else. It does make an interesting illustration of life outside the Weyrs... but that's what I read the books for! Some very good bits, though. Sets the stage for ""All the Weyrs of Pern"" very well."
2,"A mediocre book, poor and weak","If you love Pern, if you thrilled at the first riding of Ramath by F'larr's dragon, or the fall of Canth, do NOT read this book. It is pure dreck, proof that McCaffrey has ""Heinlein's Disease"" (which casues SF writers to really suck with their last few books before they die). Do read ALL THE WEYRS OF PERN, though, it's great, and absolutely requied for any fan of Pern."
5,LOVE IT,I STARTED READING THE PERN SERIES IN 1983 AND HAVE READ EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME OUT SINCE. THE RENEGADES OF PERN SHOWS THE SIDE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE AND THEIR LIVES OUTSIDE OF THE WEYRS AND IS EVERY BIT AS INTERESTING AS LIFE WITH THE BIG DRAGONS. THE CHARACTERS IN THIS NOVEL ARE WOVEN BACK INTO LATER NOVELS AND GIVES YOU A BACKGROUND INTO HOW THEY HAPPEN TO BECOME A PART OF THE WHOLE. I REREAD THE ENTIRE SERIES FROM THE DISCOVERY OF PERN TO THE FINAL YEARS OF THREAD EVERY YEAR AND NEVER GET TIRED OF THE CHARACTERS.
3,Starts painfully slow but gets better,"This book starts out with a bunch of people you don't care about, it took me ages to get through the first half. About halfway through it moves closer to characters you actually give a crap about. Anne McCaffrey could easily have chopped it in half and tacked the second half onto the end of The White Dragon and been better off for it, but then I guess more books adds up to more sales. I'm glad I finished it but it was by no means the best, and I've read at least ten of her books so far."
3,"Good book, but lacking somehow","This is a pretty good book, but I found it one of the weaker Pern books. It spans way too many years (about 27) and tells about things that that are in other books (Fax's death, Piemur's journey around the Southern Continent, and the stealing of Ramoth's queen egg, for instance). This wouldn't be a big problem because it gives these events from other people's perspectives, but there is a bigger problem. In the middle of the book, McCaffrey shifts from talking about Thella, Jayge, and Aramina, and instead talks about the Southern Continent and the discovery of Landing. If they would just stick to the renegades, it would have been a great book. On the plus side, the characters were wonderfully developed and it was nice to see Pern from the perspective of the ordinary people. But I'm afraid this is an example of a great idea being ruined by including too much and spanning too many years."
2,Not Her Best Work . . .,"I found that the Renegades of Pern was good for filling in the blanks left by McCaffrey's other books but little else. The storyline was less than engaging and it was confusing the way she would write for a few pages and then skip ahead three years. Like I said, it filled in the blanks. This is not McCaffrey's best work at all. I have read many of the Pern books and I felt that they were a far better read than this one. You wouldn't want to read The Renegades of Pern if you hadn't read just about every other Pern book before it because you would get lost very, very, very quickly. Look into getting your hands on this if you are curious about some of the lesser characters but don't expect an exciting read."
3,"Good, but outdated","I find myself ambivalent about this book. I have been teaching University students since 1982 and was hoping for new tricks and techniques that might help me to continue improving. This book is a compilation of such tricks and techniques that might prove useful to a new Assistant Professor. However, the book was originally written in 1993 and has few references more recent than 1992. I'm not sure how many faculty need to know how to use the three-layer blackboards that used to be standard fixtures at the front of giant lecture halls. The description of multimedia uses Hypercard as the example of what's state-of-the-art. The few references to Internet resources have BITNET addresses. Much has changed in the classroom since 1992, but the new teacher won't learn about it from this source. Although this book would be helpful for teachers in the undergraduate classroom, I feel that they will also find it frustrating."
5,Tools for Teaching,This is a book that I used when I taught at a college and when I went for my Master's in Education. I used it then and wanted a copy of my own to refer to as I substitute teach at the local school in my community as a retired professor. Good ideas within it!
4,Help yourself to self-improvement,"Dr. Porter takes the subject of the mind and explains how to use it to your best potential in a way that everyone can comprehend. Patrick has taken the subject of becoming your best, applied it to himself, with his clients and now with this book shows you how you can tap into that genius part of yourself. This book is excellent for those wanting an easy to read and easy to understand method of getting the best from yourself."
5,Great New Age-Techno U2 and Classic U2,"I loved this CD and I've been a U2 fan all my life. The band is always exploring new ideas and sounds, but never losing touch of Joshua Tree and earlier rhythms evidenced by 'Please' and 'If God Will Send His Angels'. 'Do You Feel Loved' and 'Mofo' are pump-you-up, excitable tunes that remind me of the energy provided by 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'. A great album and looking forward to the next."
5,U2's most mature offering quite underrated,"Though this album has quite often been considered a failure by industry standards, I feel it is just another example of the ever growing talent of these four men, and those they choose to produce them. Pop starts off purposely flagrant and throw away but by 'Gone' the band is deep in new emotions, new colors, and new feelings. With every listen the album grows in its greatness and the truly amazing subtleties of each song become more apparent. Not an album to be taken lightly, 'Pop' is strong and mature."
5,THE LAST U2 MASTERPIECE,"This should have been the last U2 album, when they were at the top of the hill. They should have released an extraordinary double CD set with ""The Best Of"" ( from 1980 - 1998 ), after their most succesful Tour ever ( yet they got more tickets than Zoo TV one !! ).Everything is a pleasure listen here: Innovative, provocative, different, experimental, varied, sonic, mind-blowing, etc.Their further lame sold out U2 2000 is pathetic.I really can't stand this wide labeled and sold out iPod band now !!!!.With Pop you won't find trademarked guitars, safe playing, lame lyrics, silly videos, etc. You'll find a whole new band. This album is pretty their ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"".Just songs like Mofo, Discotheque, Staring At The Sun, Please, Gone, etc, are better alone than the whole crappy U2 2000 era.DON'T LISTEN TO THEIR RIPPING OFF EMBRACE, LISTEN TO THIS, THE LAST U2 MASTERPIECE"
3,A new sound for U2 ...,"In my opinion, this is the weakest cd from U2 since their first two albums. Few good cuts like ""Discotheque"", ""If God will send his angels"",""Staring at the sun"", ""Gone"" and ""Wake up dead man"". The other tracks are a bit dissapointing for me, I understand that some might like it a lot but I don't...Sorry ...but I still like this band a lot."
3,THEY CAN DO A LOT BETTER,This is average U2. Wait for the next album; it will be their best... well they said it!
2,pretty weak,"Don't let the die-hard U2 fans fool you. Borrow from a friend if you must. I think I've listened to this twice since I bought it. Other U2 albums, hundreds of times. That says it all."
2,No it's not their greatest but it has a couple of stand outs,I was given a loan of this album and I have to say only four tracks are in any way decent. The rest is just substandard dross that outstays it's welcome. It's only a shame they went ultra safe with ATYCLB because that was even worse - like listening to the rest of this album only worse. When will Bono retire that's what I want to know
5,solid,"This album is heavily electronic, but then, I don't really mind electronic or rock. Infact I like both. It bothers me when people have to categorise something as either rock or electronic when it should be taken for what it is...MUSIC. I think the people who think they've sold out are the ones who aren't as open minded as they'd like to think they are. Music is about experimenting with new sounds, not staying in the same place. I'd be bored to death listening to U2 for 20 years if they sounded the same on every album.I've only just heard this one, and I'm pleasantly surprised (i hate rating music, but i did it just to counterbalance the negative reviews:)... I enjoy this album more than their previous ones. Definietly underrated."
3,U2 POPS UP,"To use a baseball analogy, you can't hit a home run every time you bat and U2 gets at least a bloop single for ""POP."" Although, the disk did stay in my CD Player for 5-6 months. The best songs are Gone, Please and If You Wear That Velvet Dress. Some of the songs are experimental and I am ok with that, but, it's not what I want to hear from these guys. The title track and Mofo sound like The Edge is experimenting with chainsaws. If you are new to U2, buy The Joshua Tree or War and leave this one off. But for diehards like me, this one will be added to the collection, but, only for looks."
3,Good If Not Quite Over The Top,"Pop is not the most commercial U2 recording on the planet. Nonetheless, this is certainly an intriuging piece of work. The band utilizes a lot of creative rhythms and varying tones specifically on such tunes like Discotheque, Please, Staring At The Sun, and Last Night On Earth.The Edge is in fine form on guitar. Even though the guitar sounds are not always front and center, the solos are pretty unique from track to track.Bono is a bit inconsistent in the vocal area. On tracks such as Mofo and If You Wear That Velvet Dress, he sounds muffled as it is difficult to make out the words. However on If God Will Send His Angels and Last Night On Earth the emotion is quite strong.Overall, this is a good effort by U2 as there are seven pretty good to excellent tunes. They experiment with different sounds without going too overboard. Change is a good thing. However, songwise, the effort is a little short of Achtung Baby."
4,Don't be dissuaded by popular criticism,"Constantly overlooked as just frivolous experimentation, however the tracks are strong in their own right, and come together as a surprisingly complete package. This is not a marginal album; it's a highlight and milestone for U2. It's not their most polished production but ambitious and essential just the same. A stretch for a band many would prefer to corner into a certain genre."
2,Will the real members of U2 please stand up,"Whatever happened to the greatest rock band of our times? While repeated listening reveals some traces of the real U2 in their previous 'Zooropa', there is absolutely no trace of them in their new album. Maybe the U2 died in the 80s"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I remember in 1995 when I got hooked on U2. I went to Dublin to see all the places where the boys in U2 grew up in. And Windmill Lane. It was a nice time and I highly recommend going to Dublin, just generally. It's a great city. Anyway, that's not what I should write about here. Well, after all the wait for a new studio-album we got PoP. Zooropa came out in 1993 so it was a time for a new album. When hearing the first single off the album, Discothèque, I got worried. It's a song I can't hear more than once a year. There are only two songs I like on the album, 'Staring at the Sun' and 'Wake Up Dead Man'."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I still have this CD and every once in awhile I pop it in to see if maybe by some miracle I am missing something in my opinion that this is the worst cd U2 ever made. Every time I do I just reassure myself that this is indeed the worst thing they ever put out. Innovative?, Exciting?, Dynamic? No, just a boring piece of [junk]."
2,P-U,"This one stinks worse than Kid A. This is U2's equivalent of the Stones' ""Dirty Work."" A real stinker."
1,Junk,"Supporters of this album are always calling it ""misunderstood"" or ""tragically underrated.""Well, give us detractors more credit. We understand. We understand that this is bottom-of-the-barrel technojunk. This was an attempt at a stylistic change that just plain didn't work. Stylistic changes are fine if they work -- heck, the Beatles went through tons of 'em and succeeded every time. But this falls absolutely flat. Too bad."
1,One of the worst cd's i've ever heard,"I am a HUGE U2 fan. I just wanted to state that before i start the bashing of this cd. This cd is truely just a mixture of sound effects. It has no rythmn! I don't understand how U2 could have put out a cd like this even if it was experimental, this is just trash. Please do not waste your money on this. Go out and buy Joshua tree, Achtung Baby, or All that you can't leave behind. Almost any other u2 cd is better than this!"
1,past their peak,I've been a big fan of u2 for years and I think that their 80s and early 90s material is really good such as albums like achtung baby and the joshua tree. Pop seems to be a weak attempt to recapture the time when their music was still groundbreaking and well written.
5,Great U2 album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I first heard the song Discotheque and woundered who did that song and win I found out it was U2 I was pleasently surprised by it!!! I mean I had never heard them sound like that before and I think it was great that they decided to experiment with techno, but I am glad they didn't keep doing it because I don't think it is their strong, that is still rock!! Not to say I don't like this album because I do and only U2 could have mixed techno with rock and make it sound good!! So if your a fan of U2 than I would get this one it will great addition to your music collection!!!!!!!!!"
4,Staying Ahead,"It's now been five plus years since the release of Pop, and one thing remains the same,U2. The lack of praise for this album is understandable, but only an impatient response would fail to sense, feel, even see the genius behind it. Pop for myself was an album that grew on me, i nearly detested it at the beginning, stating, ""this isn't U2"". No, so what is? What is U2? Change. U2 has been able to trascend the ropes of rock and roll, and shift itself into a categorie all to its own. I'm not saying it will take five years for you to like this album, more like five months. This is my favorite album from U2. It's not an especially uplifting piece, but it makes you want to feel active in the world. My favorite track has changed numerous times, but currently its, ""If You Wear That Velvet Dress"". This song clinches U2 for me, everything in one song. This album isn't a four its a four 1/2, definately an essential in the progression of U2."
4,"A solid effort, the end of an era for U2","This CD may not have the sense of adventure that Achtung Baby and Zooropa had, but the lyrics are some of the best and most personal that Bono has ever done.'Pop', at least musically, seems to lack the sense of exploration that the rest of the 90s U2 music displayed. The band had seemed to arrive at a point musically where the music doesn't progress into new territory.My personal view about 'Pop' is similar to 'Rattle and Hum'. Both CDs are a collection of well written songs that come at a certain endpoint in their career. Even though 'Pop' received lukewarm reviews and was a relative commercial disappointment, the CD will be remembered for some truly great songs and as a close to Chapter 2 to U2's career. We'll just have to wait and see how Chapter 3 unfolds. It will probably be different from what we've previously heard and the exploration and adventure will be back."
5,READ THE REVIEW FROM OCTOBER 8,"By reading the aforementioned review one will gain insight to the ""mindlessness"" and ""stupidity"" of those who do not appreciate U2. The notion of stating that Guns'n'Roses is better than U2 is absolutly absurd. Funny how Guns has sustained a following considering that they only had one real album."
4,that's a good cd but very different from the real U2,"Definetely good, but if you don't like changes and updates Don't buy i"
5,"This is brilliant, creative, and absolutely f***ing flawless","My title says it all. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing.Pop is a concept album of sorts, not musically, there are no recurring musical ideas or phrases, but thematically. The underlying theme in this album is humanity's increasing alienation and abandonment in the modern world. Pop is just full of intensity, innovation and originality.Pop is a work of genius, non mainstream U2. It`s modern day Sgt Pepper."
3,Who are these people and what have they done with U2?!?!,"U2 is one of the few bands who have deservingly earned their seat among the world's greateset musicians. No other band has done more '360s' than they have. I somewhat enjoyed listening to their most recent album, 'Pop' yet it was not the U2 I would like to know. I'm sure I'm among the many U2 fans who yearn for the day when they will pick up their instruments again (hopefully on their 'new album' ha). They are the best at their craft but should return to the rock sound they were founded on and abandon the shallowness of techno. Since 'Achtung Baby' it was clear that U2 was straying away from their trademark sound (which is drowned out by the albums programing. Then 'Zooropa' and later, 'Passengers' came along which finalized their severence. But I guess since 'Achtung Baby' there was no looking back (sigh)."
3,disappointment,"although U2 can't possibly make a bad album, POP doesn#t follow the same astonishing path the two previous 90's recordings had opened. ""Achtung baby""(91) and ""zooropa"" (93) were completely unpredictable and sounded completely new. this time U2 doesn't surprise as much, as we had previously listened to songs like ""mofo"". Yet, their live act, ""POPMART"" is absolutely incredible, and it's basic for you to know this album. These songs live sound completely different, and U2 does't dissapoint at all"
2,What happened?,"I used to remember when U2 meant something, when their lyrics were inspiring and the music was innovative. Sadly, it appears that they are more concerned with making fun of themselves and the music industry than coming up with good music. Though there are a couple of catchy tunes ('Do You Feel Loved, If God Would Send His Angles'), I think this album pales in comparison to their earlier work. Hopefully they will get off this dance kick. So many other bands do it better."
2,U2 and God,"Bono's journey away continues. Forget the beauty of ""Joshua Tree."" U2 is now full of postmodern smooze. U2 obviously sees themselves as bigger than life, a joke if you will. But the joke here almost backfires as Bono struggles to write good music and the lyrics all seem to have a ""been there before"" theme. Try again boys....I hope the fire is still alive."
3,Post-Pop is poor,3 1/2Pop was considered poop by many fans disarmed by pseudo-vapid uncomfortable dancey experimentations- call it the Zooropa syndrome... though I would advise them to reconsider; it remains in my ears U2's last album I could also graciously acknowledge with me-too.
3,Worst U2 album,"""Pop"" beats out ""Zooropo"" by a nose as worst U2 album, but it's still not bad. ""Discotheque"" is something they never should have tried, ""Miami"" and ""The Playboy Mansion"" aren't very good. Still, there are about four really fine songs here. When U2 goes for songs over ""cool"" style they're still quite good."
5,U2's third album and their best,"This album was originally released in 1983 to an awaiting newly established fan base. 'Pop' brought together for U2 a newer sound mixed with the introduction of techno anthem beats in a few of their songs. 'Discotheque' is a primary example of the mixing of U2's modern rock meeting anthem techno and the result is a positive song mix sound that is pleasing to the ears. The album has many new songs previously unreleased as well as reworked songs. 'Mofo', is another exploratory song by this band that brought together soft rock beats with a little European grunge flavour. The songs that standout in this beautifully designed album are 'Gone', 'Please' and 'If God Will Send His Angels'.This album release is for any fan of this Irish 4 person band headed by the rock god 'Bono' himself. 'The Edge' on guitars is cutting edge and decent to listen to. Get the CD and add it to your U2 collection, you sure won't be dissapointed."
3,Better than I thought it would be...,"I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam and the Stone Temple Pilots, so U2 just isn't my style of music. I was fairly impressed with ""Pop""; this is coming from a guy who can't stand techno. This is a techno album with a touch of rock. However, it is good. The entire middle part of the album is great. I especially liked ""Staring at the Sun"", ""Last Night on Earth"", and ""Gone"".Some tracks really take this album down. I'm not going to bash ""Discotheque"", because that was an OK song. But ""Mofo"" was horrible. I also didn't like ""Please"". ""Wake Up Dead Man"" is a fairly weak song.""Pop"" was an album I really wanted to hate like most other people, and I bought it out of mere curiousity. I found this stuff interesting, however. Perhaps I'll give ""Zooropa"" a try..."
1,Lame attempt by U2,"U2 tried a new direction with POP, and it failed. I am very strong U2 fan, and this is by far the worst album they ever recorded. Past experiments by U2 have mostly suceeded, such as Achtung Baby and Zooropa. But I have listened to POP several times, and it still just doesn't sink in. No matter how many times I give it a try, it always comes up empty. Save your money and concentrate on Boy, War, Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. POP is a very forgettable recording."
1,Fizzle,"U2 began the 1990's with the bold and innovative ""Achtung! Baby"" and it ended the decade with the flat and pretentious ""Pop."" This is U2 at its worst. ""Pop"" is nothing more than a tiresome piece of pseudo-commentary on marketing and commercialization and listening to it is about as enjoyable as flossing your teeth. This album is an unlistenable piece of techno-junk. Don't waste your money on it!"
2,"This is the same band that wrote ""Pride,"" right?","I really tried to like this album. I got into the drums on ""Mofo."" I dug the lyrics about God. I even cracked a smile when Bono sang about the Playboy Mansion. And then I took the disc out of the stereo and tossed it across the room. It made a popping sound as it broke into tiny pieces. Next!"
1,"Lonely star for ""If God will send his angels""","U2 is a band that will never be as good as bands like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Guns'n Roses and many others. This CD is very poor. U2 makes good music, but their best doesn't even approach PJ's or Nirvana's best. The only good song in it is ""If God will send his angels"", and the rest of the songs is awful for a band that has songs like ""With or without you"" and ""I still haven't found what I'm looking for""."
1,Bono Princess of POP right next to John Mayer the mistress of POP,"U2 are not a rock band they are pop, pop rock at best, and not that good at either."
4,El ultimo disco de U2 que en verdad me gustó...,"Este disco lo compré dado que estoy realizando mi propia colección (el otro lo tuve que dejar en casa de mi familia). Recuerdo cuando salió este album y me gustó mucho, de principio a fin. El disco se maneja en diferentes ritmos y por ningun motivo caen en la monotonía. Desafortunadamente, después vino la decadencia de su estilo y el disco que probablemente sea el último con la esencia de U2 es All that you can't leave behind, el cual puede ser un poco aburrido. En fin, este disco es una maravilla."
4,Fans who dislike this album have missed the point.,"I was extremely dissappointed in the response to this album. I thought it was very good-not as good as Achtung Baby or Joshua Tree, but good in it's own way. Fans who are upset at how U2's music has evolved, are failing to really understand them. U2's ability to grow and change as artists is one of the many reasons they are one of the most respected and popular rock bands in the world. I applaude this album as well as their efforts to keep changing."
4,Great album!,"This album is awesome! I've only been a U2 fan for just over 1 year, and didn't buy all the albums in order. I had probably 2-3 of their albums before buying Pop.I was very surprised, but I loved it. Music has seemed to all mix together and be the same, and this album breaks that trend. I love when bands do experimental things, because sometimes it starts another trend.This is not my #1 favorite U2 album, but it is ONE of my few favs from the band."
4,U2-Pop,"I don't know why so many people don't like this album; I think its great. On Pop, U2 hasn't lost their old edge, they just experiment with more electronica than on Achtung Baby and sometimes it comes across as pop..but wasn't that the point? ""Discotheque"" is unlike any other U2 song and ""Staring At the Sun"" is reminescent of past songs, but with a slighty more electronic touch. Pop is one of my favorite U2 albums. Its everything I could have wanted, plus a little more. Thats not selling out-its evolving."
5,POP Puts the Rest to Shame,"POP is U2's best album to date. Each album gets better and better, especially with repeated listenings. Many say this album is ""experimental"" but the most experimental was Zooropa. POP is a deeply emotional album whose powerful lyrics are shrouded in new sounds and beats. When Madonna put out Ray of Light, she was applauded for reinventing herself with a new sound. U2 did the same a year before, but were blased in the press. It's not techno, trip hop, or rock. POP refuses to be classified or labelled and U2 wouldn't have it any other way."
4,A truly weird album,"It was... interesting. I liked Discotheque, and If God Will Send His Angels, and Gone, I didn't like Mofo so much, but it gave me an altogether eery feeling. People say Zooropa was post-apocolyptic, but I'm more inclined to believe that that was the feeling I got from listening to this. It took some time to warm up to. It's one of the ones you have to get over before you can start to appreciate."
5,Brilliant and pure U2,"Pop is not a techno album, it's a U2 album. U2 is using new tools to create the same beautifully crafted music they've always made. If you listen to this album, looking for all the elements that aren't U2 to you, the U2 from 1987, you'll be disappointed. Why? Because U2 changes, they evolve, they're growing and they're keeping it fresh. They've reinvented themselves, and they'll do it again. The fact that this truly is a brilliant album just proves that U2 is one extrordinary band. This is the same U2 from 1987, but with a new voice."
4,Very close to 5 stars...............,"One day, U2 will write a bad song. However after listening to this, and their newer stuff (The Ground Beneath Her Feet & Beautiful Day) I am convinced that day is a long long way away.Anyways, this might be a ""safer"" album than Zooropa, but by no means is it less enjoyable. Bono's voice in some of these ballads (in particular Please) moves me as much as any Radiohead vocals. Discotheque is just plain cool, and Staring At The Sun is a rock classic!!!!!!!U2 are a very special rock band"
4,The U2 album for people who don't really like U2,"Maybe you're like me and you own U2's best-known albums like The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and All That You Can't Leave Behind, but just find them a little boring and don't listen to them all that much. Your tastes are generally quite a bit left of U2.If this sounds like you, you may really like Pop. It's the one U2 album that I listen to consistently, because of its interesting textures and electronic influences. Maybe I should have titled this review ""the U2 album for R.E.M. fans."""
3,"There's Gems, but the experiment doesn't work so well..","Many U2 fans would like to just forget that this album ever happened. Pop. The electronica experiment. It was, in many regards, an album with a half-finished sound, songs that could be so much more than they were, but were not. The music is very light and at times sparse, and full of electronic sounds. In many ways, this was the band's attempt at a proper pop type album, but it does not work so very well. However, there are gems to be found. Dischteque is a great dance/pop song, If God Will Send His Angels is enjoyable in an etheral way, and Staring at the Sun is also a nice down-tempo kind of tune. While a true U2 fan will find enjoyment in this album's better gems, many casual listeners will probably find more enjoyment in the band's other work."
1,I don't get it,"I can't understand what people like about this disc. It has almost no redeeming qualities. If you're a U2 worshipper you will like this album, simply because you will force yourself to pretend it's good, even though any clear minded listener will know that the opposite is true."
1,POP el mayor fracaso de U2,"Si nunca has oido un disco de U2 y jamás has oido una canción de ellos no te compres este disco.Aquí no estan los U2 ""epicos"" del Joshua y los innovadores del ""Atchung Baby"".Una vez U2 quisieron pasarse a lo tecno y la pifiarón.Este ""POP"" de U2 equivale al en su día ""Hot Space"" de Queen.Pasarse del pop al techno sólo esta al alcance de unos pocos.Sir ir más lejos Madonna ya lleva 3 discos,pero es que a U2 este POP le sento tan mal que ya no lo han vuelto a intentar."
1,A Terrible Disappointment,The great leaps the band had taken featured on the debut albumof the Passengers now seem an enigma. Pop does nothing but makepainfully aware that U2 lacks a certain quality and colour when working without the collaboration of Brian Eno.
1,enough already,"What started brilliantly with Achtung Baby, became somewhat repetitive with Zooropa and Passengers, has now with Pop, become a hopless mire of techno gobbledy goop. When will they finally make a rock and roll record, ie. tracks like God Part II and Womanfish!"
2,U2 Go AWOL !!!,"For starters, I love U2. They are without doubt the most influential band in the world today. But, not all U2 albums can be classics. This is 'experimental' U2, and some of it works and other bits don't. 'Discoteque', 'Please', 'Staring At the Sun' and 'Gone' are all terrific but the rest meander into meaningless self-indulgent fodder..I have tried to like this album but have given up....For U2 fans only, otherwise get the best tracks on their Best-Of albums..."
1,"Where ru U2...you know 4 guys from Ireland, great music????","YUCK! This is total sellout time for U2. What went wrong? The world will never know. I guess that what happens eventually. It becomes a business and the passion to write great music fades away. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! Pick up someting earlier like, ""War"", ""The Unforgettable Fire"", or ""The Joshua Tree"", but not this album!"
2,"""Pop"" goes U2's Greatness","Here is the U2 album where the sound took over, and left the good songwriting behind. This is definitely not one of the Dublin band's best; one would have thought that - given four years between ""Zooropa"" and ""Pop"" - they'd reinvent themselves again. But they still revisit the same techno sound they first dabbled in on 1991's Achtung Baby, albeit this time with far less impressive results.As a result, ""Pop"" largely failed with casual and faithful U2 fans alike, and thus the band tried too hard to win them back with their formulaic and over-commerical All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000)."
2,Lazy Trash,"U2's anticlimactic, flimsy beats and rythums, coupled with Bono's lazy, lackluster lyrics (""your holy war/ your northern star/ your sermon on the mount/ in the boot of your car...""), make POP sound more like POOP. PLEASE give us a break guys! You are rock icons. Start acting like it!"
1,Back to basics boys!,"There was a time when I lived and breathed U2 on a daily basis. I couldn't wait to hear the latest scrap of information on them, no matter how significant or trivial. That was then, during the 'War/Unforgettable Fire/Joshua Tree' era. Now, it just pains me to watch them resort to this techno trash. What happened?! They used to lead the charge, now their just ""running to stand still"" with a dozen other noise bands. The lackluster sales on this album should be a wake up call. I don't care what the critics say, I liked them better when they took themselves seriously. I wish they would ""reinvent"" themselves back to their roots."
3,EVIDENCE-Based?,"A book on evidence-based medicine that lacks bibliographical references in the text. I expected bigger precision. Sincerely, it defrauded me."
1,anybody else had enough of Stuart Little?,"I cant believe Ja could be so predictable. 50, Em, D12, G-Unit all hit him with a barrage of disses on his lovey-dovey R&B style. So what does Rule do? Of course, try to be gangsta. You cannot deny the fact that Ja Rule has lyrical skills; if he didnt, Def Jam wouldnt have signed him. But...if you've never sold drugs, if u dont even own a gun (let alone shoot at people), if you've never been in a gang, or a gunfight, then lets not rap about it huh? It makes it so hard to listen to Ja say ""we gon clap back...lets take em to war"" when if it came down to it, he would just run and hide. Stop fakin Ja, and go back to your fool-proof sing-along with the ladies formula."
1,Awesome comedy,"This must be the most hilarious thing I've heard since I bought a Hammer CD from the pawn shop. This clown and his posse are just flat out hilarious. I can just hear them saying: ""Boy, if we have a shotgun shot every few seconds that'll make us gangsta sh*t and hardcore. And if dat dun convince 'em, let's just remind them that we hardcore and gangsta sh*t on EVERY single track."" I couldn't help but bust a gut every time Ja and his b*tches spouted about being hardcore, gangsta sh*t, and all that entails with cocked back shotguns every few seconds. This ranks about a 100 on the Unintentional Comedy Scale. Ja, keep on posing along with your Murda Inc. c*cks**kers. Keep on turning out crap, so I can extract immense comedic enjoyment. Thank God (Darcell sr.) that I didn't buy it."
1,ja sucks,ja sucks and 50 sucks you guys don't know what real hip hop is.CHECK THE UNDERGROUND YOU IDIOTS
1,Ja needs to be Ja,"45 Used Jas allready.,whats that tell ya? this album is garabage. Ja Rule was dope when he came out and then he sold out. Now all of a suden he wants back his street cred because his feelings got hurt by aftermath. Ja needs to be Ja and ignore all this beef stuff and just keep doing what sells him records, and that is making stupid r&b/hip hop songs for the radio that the girls love so he can keep takin his shirt off. Cool J is the only MC who can rock it both ways. Ja got punked out of his gangster image so he needs to lay it lie."
4,Workin back for the throne,I really never got to listen to the CD but i did hear a selectfew tracks and the tracks i heard displayed steriod man[50 cent]ja had heart to put this album out and the mighty RULE gets respect from the kid The production is Raw the Skits had me in tears the only that didn't get it five stars was that there were 2many skits but overall Rule kept it str8 hood
1,Can't go back to being gangsta so sing If I can't get away,"I didn't buy this cd!! My friend brought this garbage and I heard one joint and I think he ripped it off Sizzla's joint if I am not mistaken and this cat really sounds gangsta cookie monster. I don't give a damn if he got one of 2pac's main men Hussein on this album, it doesn't do him justice. After disrespecting certain artists just because they listen to 50 cent is ridiculous and that shows how much of a p***Y he is. His best album was the first one. If you want hip hop get his first album. Go back to singing ""Damn I need some milk to put on my oreo cookies"" or something. Clap back to that!!! I didn't even want to give him 1 star but hey....."
3,"Ja Rule vs. 50 cent= BEEF, GUNS> etc.","Jarule has beef wit 50. I would just like to know the exact truth on why dis beef started. If dis crap dont stop, I definatly know that someone is gonna pull out a few A-K, more likely 50 den Ja.50-talks stuff, he kinda punked out, and right now, Ja is got the light shinin on him. We dont know about 50's new album if he got lryics on it bout Ja, his momma, his wife, or his 3 children. I suggest that Ja get some guns and bullet proof cuz 50 already got some.We shouldn'd let all dis crap lead to 2 more deaths. We dont want another Tupac and Bigge."
3,Back from the begining but far tooooooo late.,I luv his album when his first came out but after that he sucks. But now you came back JA NOW! because of a cocky puck name 50 cent you let him get to you. Come on Ja let it go and just ignore him. Even know I like both of them. 50 just like picking on people anyway and 50 did say he was a bad guy don't stoop to his level just do movies but not with segal.
4,Ja rule is back,"Im no 50 hater or ja rule lover, but honestly this album is good. I bought it skeptically as his last attempt was bad. However i was pleasently suprised. Ja flows well, no singing, and the raw energy can be felt in every song. The production is great as most murder inc production is. Lyrically he only really spits anger, but he does it well. Without a doubt this is a hot album, there are no fillers. I can't understand how ppl can give this lees than 3 stars. And to the ppl above saying 50 is better lyrically that is a joke. 50 is honestly a hopeless ryhmer. The only reason i like him is because he isn't too serious and hes got a good backing, aftermath/shady... this album is definitely worth about 3.5-4 stars no fillers and all head nodding tracks, full of energy what more could you want. I will actually be looking forward for his next album ( i actually did't think i would say that after the last temptation)"
1,Ja Drool is Fu*c&ed,"Cant stand him, or anything he does. His only decent song was Holler Holler, everything He releases is crap, pop rap! Ja Drool makes chic music, if your a girl concerned about you hair and nails, then get this album, I feel sorry for the guys bumbing this in there ride."
1,this man is a idiot,"why in the world would this man go against shady/aftermath with no lyrical skills, he sings r&b, he is no rapper, he is a F**!!!i will never but this mans cds again cause he claims to be pac, and sings with nysync, pac wont do that,what makes this man even more dumb, is that he thinks that he can go head to head with eminem....no way possible...eminem is a lyrical genius..ja rule is a lyrical b***h 50 cent crushes ja rule with everyline and the g-unit kills irve fatty...PEOPLE BUY THE G_UNIT CD, JA RULE IS NOT WORTH IT, HE IS A FAKE A** BUSTER.."
1,this is not gansta,"I listen to the cd at the store today and it sounds like the hole album is about 50 cent. I maen i can understand you have a beef and you make a cuple of songs BUT THE HOLE ALBUM! I also dont see how people can just forgive ja rule turning gansta now. Thier like ja rules back gansta,this is the ja rule we know. Like he's a ligthwitch or somthing. You flick up hes a gansta, you flick down hes a singer. 50 cent gets in the game, its like OOOOH now he's a gansta agin? Gansta agin? thats how you can tell if hes realy a gansta or not. You just cant rap about r&b and as soon as someone starts saying somthing about you now your back hardcore.Thats not how it works a true gansta dose'nt have to put on a frunt. A true gansta stays gansta from start to finish.Look at 2 pac, I can respect 2 pac because he lied and die thug life and did'nt have to chang for nobody, or to sell records."
2,JA RULE SUCKS,this is a good cd but in no way does ja rule compare to 50 and eminem.. he tries to tear them apart adn it doesnt work... if u think he did a good job rippin on 50 tehn u deff. didint hear the dj green lantern stuff yet... so do u self a favor and go to whatever software u use to d/l music and type in dj green lantern to hear 50 and em ripe ja rule up
4,This is a Good album.,"An excellent effort from Ja. Not quite as hard as his debut but it's a return to the style that mad us fans in the late 90s. He got rid of the watered down R&B garbage (temporarily) for this and added collabos with Hussien Fatal (of 2pacs Outlawz) and some banging beats that will have you nodding your head ready to shoot something! Give this album a chance, glad I did."
1,JA Has Fans?????????????????,"Ja wishes he was Pac, he wants to be Pac.......Too bad he has no idea he sucks. this is the sorriest attempt to come at someone......Why make a whole cd at one man, I mean your just giving Fifty more ammo.......And going at Em was a BIG mistake. oh well at least i will get a good laugh at Pac wanna be when Em gets on him. For those who like this GARBAGE take a step back and listen to his lyrics......They suck I mean how many times can you say F'someone? Oh well we will see if he sells 1mill records in 2 day wont we"
2,this album feels rushed,"ok ""Blood in my eye"" is the latest chapter in the coinuing saga that is the beef of Ja and 50 cent. Ja obviously has vengeance on his mind thus ""Blood in my eye"". Apart from ""The crown"" ""clapback"" and ""Change gon come"" the album really is nothing much to speak of. and once again another Ja album that doesnt stand the test lyrically. He has no rhymes the lyrics on most of the songs are repetitive and unoriginal. Whoever said Ja needs to stick with that R&B girl(Ashanti) is right. Ja i suggest you stick to what sells otherwise you are continuing to fight a war you cant win. The album is not his worst effort but it is lacking and feels rushed. Ja what ever happened to taking the time to make a quality record. If you are a diehard Ja fan (making you an idiot) go cop it. If you are a fan of hip hop and the beef between Ja and 50 go cop it. If you are looking for a top notch album from a top notch artist look elsewhere."
2,Album ent saying nothing special,With this album Ja Rule is trying to show that he is still street and not just a commercial rapper. He does have some success with this by not featuring any female singers and not singing about his usual topic of love. However the album really is'nt that strong. His style doesnt vary enough and with the exception of the two singles that I had already heard none of the songs on the album stood out. Also the whole album seems like it is trying to diss 50 which seems a bit lame. I definately think this album should be skipped. Ja really ent saying anything special with it.
1,Garbage,"Another crap record from Stuart Little.Dude fell off. He needs to give it up. What was that crap meeting with Farrakhan? He just wanted to boost his sales. Man people need to stop hating on 50 and G- Unit. They already murdered The Inc. They will continue murdering them. Dont waste your time even downloading this album. If Ja would have stuck with the formula he had with Venni Vetti Vicci, it would be a different story. Go cop G-Unit instead of this mess. Stuart Little put a fork in it!!!!!"
1,I cant believe this guy made another weak album.,"I must say that this is one of the worst excuses for music that I have ever heard.I thought that this joker was done making music but I guess he's milking his music career for everything its worth.As far as the album,every song on the cd sucks because it has the same old weak beats and some of the most ridiculous lyrics anyone has ever wrote.His voice just simply annoys me to no end and I wish he stopped making music and movies because he cant do either one.This cd is even worse than the last temptation and we all know how weak that album was.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
1,booooooooo,he suxx like ftorres mom.that dudes d*** ridin because on his otherreviews he said it was sissy crap.****dont get mad at other people about fifty cent and ja rule and whut they sayin grow up u spik.this albium suxx badddd murder inc is just like ruff ryders.people aint D*** ridin they music suxx peoplea int fellin it.
2,Pretty Terrible,"The title says it all. Now Ja is aight and i am a fan so don't take this the wrong way but this is trash. It has maybe 2/3 good songs on the album but considering theirs only 8 it's a 2 star. I usually give a top 5 but with this their isn't any point. Only good cuts are Race Against Time II, Things Gon' Change and Blood In My Eye. Bobby Creep Skit is hella funny 2 man.Top 5:In the words of Damon Wayans in My Wife and Kids 'Er, Nah?'"
2,Ja Rule- Blood In My Eye,"I'm very unbiased because i neither like Ja Rule or 50 cent. This album is supposed to be Ja's entrance back into his hardcore image. Gone are the ""grease"" remake videos, or songs with ashanti, now Ja Rule is a hardcore thug, bustin gats and ridin on his enemies. Unfortunately for Ja, his labelmates arent very talented, and mess up a couple of songs. Also i find it odd that a former member of 2pacs group(the outlawz) Fatal was on quite a few songs. My guess is hes using Ja too get some shine from his broken career. As for the cd, there are a few bright spots. Remember this is intended as a ep, so this cd isnt as long as your typical album release. Race Against Time 2, and The Crown are good tracks. I would reccomend listening to these two songs and not buying the album, as the rest of the album is full with medicore songs, and really bad ones. Ja Rule is suppose to come out with a double album, but with this album i think i've had enough of him, nice try Ja."
1,tupac wannabe,"yo this cd is whack, 50 gonna show who's boss this friday with g-unit and blow this cd off the shelves. ja just quit man if 50 ain't gonna blow you off the shlves then eminem or D12 will."
1,g a r b a g e,"ja is garbage plain and simple. if you aren't a girl and under 20, you shouldn't be listening to this.and look what other cds people bought while getting this ja rule album.chingy, murphy lee, and joe budden! lol. that says it all."
1,Ja Ruled out of tha Game,Ja for some reason just aint doin it any morebuying this album was a waste of time & money. M.inc. should put out as much effort on this album as they so for ashanti's sh**. Ja Just cant bring it back to venni vetti vecci
1,blood in my eye?,Blood in my eye? its more like blood in my ears. Thats the way my ears were when i listen to one second of this so called rap. It's more for 13 year olds that spell great with an 8. Do yourselfa favor and get away from these bands and go into some real hardcore bands.
1,da rule iz dead,"blood in his eye? i hope thats da reason 4 diz weak cd, cause itz far from good. tried 2 come back to actually rappin and this what he put out? this iz garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!no song on dis cd is over 2 starz."
4,STR8 UP GANGSTA,"In this release Ja Rule proves he has the lyrical edge over 50 cent, who in his release doesnt really have any hardcore rap style tracks apart from the track 'What Up Gangsta' everything else lacks real lyrical talent. And his flows slow and the excus is about getting shot in the jaw etc.[...]Ja Rule earns back his credibility as a rap artist with this album. All those who thought Ja Rule was finished, hes just getting started with this EP."
3,Kinda disappointing,"Honestly, I think Ja Rule's beef with 50 Cent is getting out of hand. Everyone already knows what's going on between them so the subject material on this album is kind of old. He should get over it and start using varied subjects. Plus, this album is just too short and has too many skits. But the songs that he makes are quite good. The beats and the flow make this album sort of worth listening to. But the aforementioned matters take away from the replay value of this album and make you wish you'd have bought another Ja Rule album. I recommend Venni Vetti Vecci or Pain Is Love besides this one if you really want a Ja Rule album."
2,Read This!!!!! anyone got someting to say come c about me!!,I don't know what all of those 5-star people are talking about. This album was dreadful. The only reason you should buy this album is if they give you your money back.Ps. F*** Black Child
2,wow ja rule dosent get the hint...,ummm ja rule tried to get back at 50 on this cd....good try ja....the only good songs are clap back and the inc is back...the only good ja rule cd was his first one...maybe next time ja
1,Excellent effort...but...,"Like my daddy told me about Arn Anderson back when his career was winding down...."" that boy got the heart, but he ain't got the tools"". Ja Ja...we know you're trying...but when you start out with no talent, it doesn't matter how hard you try, because in the end you still suck."
2,"Ja, you call this clapping back?","This album is weak. Em, 50, Dre, Daz, DMX, Obie Trice have murdered Ja. Time to rap it up Ja, every album since V.V.V has been average at best. I'll give Hussein Fatal credit, he brings the album score up a little bit, but the rest of Murderinc. can't flow for sh#t. All Ja can do is say f#@k Em, Dre, and 50??!! G-Unit and Shady should be laughing at this weak ass diss!!! We goin clap back we goin clap back we goin clap back? Fu$$in stupid"
1,This 4 G-Unit,"First I was not gonna review this , but then When I see haters WELL THAT IS A ANOTHER STORY!!!!!! Banks Album is already said to be selling over 450,000 first week!! Plus ur Right it is getting a lot of radio play and has been number one on a lot of charts.I hate haters I'm not a hater , but since u been Talk crap about Banks and G-Unit.Plus This cd get's one star 4 3 reasons1.I liked only 2 tracks off this2.This cd didn't go gold(500k)3.I hate HATER!!!!!"
2,Pfffff,"I expected better from Ja, he would never be able to top his first album! For him it as been downhill from there!And btw I don't think 2Pac would ride with ja! He ain't stupid you know!!!!!Still I don't like this cd!"
1,Jeoffrey Atkins Rapping?,"This CD is terrible! Ja Rule and Murder Inc. need to just stop making albums because they're an embarasement to hip-hop culture. This wanna-be bad imitator of Tupac needs to go back to playing tennis and hiding behind Gotti's fat Viagra, Extasy ass."
1,Ja Who?,"Ja Rule needs to give up, because we all know who is going to win this battle!50 CENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Garbage.....,"This is an awful record. The beats are a complete joke. Whoever produced this crap must have been strung out or somethin', cuz no1 in there right mind would let this sh** see the light of day. And everyone already knows ja can't write so it's expected that the lyrics would be trash too. Forget this record. Murder Inc is dead."
2,WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I HAVE TO IDMIT, THAT JA IS NO LONGER SOFT. BUT 50 IS STILL BETTER THEN JA. HE SHOULD HAVE ASHANTI ON HIS ALBUM, EVEN IF SHE WAS ON HIS LAST 2 ALBUMS. ANYWAY, DON'T BUY IT. IT STILL SUCKS."
3,is ja a wangsta?,"Ja only himself look like a wangsta he's being something he is not. Just like 50 said. But anyways the album is ok, it's hot if you like gangsta music."
4,Ja rule still one of the best,"this album is good, better than the g unit album by far, the songs ar not amazing but it is just a street album, although sometimes he overdoes it with the cursing, if ja gets some songs with other rappers like jay-z or p diddy he will get more repect thats how everyone else did it (well apart from nas) anyway ja is still one of my favourites and i like listening to his albums."
1,Ja's diss on 50 proves to be the wrong thing to do,"First he tries to be 2pac and loses fans, so what does he do next? Diss 50 cent, eminem and everyone else successful in the rap game to try and win back fans? Crazy! It proves that all this pressure has taken it's toll on him cos this new album is awful! Reigns is included on the uk version and that is the only decent track on there but it doesnt really count cos its really from his last album. Last Temptation was good- this is a disaster! The sooner he makes up with 50 cent the better because Shady Records seem to be murdering the INC!"
5,"Even though Ja is fake, this is one hell of a CD","What can I say about this CD? Well, to start off, most of the beats are hot. The lyrics aren't too bad in some of the songs but aren't that great. I wish Ja Rule and 50 Cent would get this thing worked out, because like another reviewer said, ""We don't want another Tupac and Biggie."" Now, Ja Rule to me is fake and his last CD was not that great, but this CD is 5 out of 5. Now some of you people that put a 1 out of 5 probably don't like Ja Rule and have never listened to the CD. But don't knock it if you don't know how it sounds. I don't like Ja either but this gets a 5 out of 5 stars for me."
5,JA RULE CLAPZ BACK!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS DEFINENTLY A BOMB ASS CD BY JA RULE. GO OUT AND COP THIS CD, FOR ALL THOSE ON THAT 50 CENT SHHHH DONT EVEN BOTHER GO RUN TO YOUR LIL RAT MC. AS FOR JA RULE CD ITS GOOD TO SEE THE OUTLAW HUSSEIN FATAL MAKE A GUEST APPEARANCE ON THE CD. GO GET THIS CD IF YOU DONT HAVE IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,neva like ja,lol i cant believe ppl talkin like this cd is good its lame. ja rule is a 2pac and dmx biter.we going clap back man clap these nuts in ur mouth.5o garbage 2 every comparing 50 2 2pac they need relize they will never be another pac.
2,read this!,Ja has gone from gangsta to wanksta. he used to be tight and his music was tight. back in rule 3:36 and venni vetti veici! he needs to give up music unless he goes back to bein good cuz its a waste of time for him!
2,Good but not Great,Its alright but not great he has really lost his way it seems that evey album he realses gets worse
2,ja is fake as can be,yo i gota admit ja has hot beats but his lyrics sux he cant even rhyme he acts like hes 2pac but hes not and ppl gota stop comparing 50 to pac no ones every gonna come close to him and this needs to end cuz its the same old b.s. listen to the lyrics they don make sence and why is he involveing halie haile didnt say s**t bout him
1,"""Ja rule career is a Wrap""","I laugh at your man Jeff he is a funny kat. Here's a dude that did countless of cotton candy songs and video's then want to strike back and get the love from the streets. This kid is a joke, the best thing he could of done was make one more sweet albaum and retire. Also another thing people don't be fooled by duded in these video's thats just how they make them look on t.v.Ole Gold"
3,Not that great...,"This album is not that great. Aside from a few nice beats and songs, most of the album is mediocre. The lyrics are average but better than many other rappers'.Anyone who gives this album 5 stars and calling it one of the greatest rap albums ever needs to brush up on their knowledge of hip-hop..."
4,Ja,I think that Ja's cd is a straight cd.He has a different perspective towards Hip Hop. 50 is also a very good artist but its a large difference between him and Ja. Everyone wants to be on 50's side but Ja still stands and hes trying very hard to get back up again so I give him props.Go get tha cd if u a true music luver.
2,never needed to be released,this alblum is not one of best pieces of work. clap back is hot and #4 is is worhty overall the alblum is full of old lyrics and and redefined beats.get it if u want to hear old beats re-done but not really worth bumping in the trunk for more than a week
3,yeh s'allrite,"It's a good try and the CD's not that bad. But when you're competing with Jay-z's and G-units new albums its tricky to come out on top. He doesnt seem to pay attention to the beats hes rapping over and some of them don't create the right atmosphere for his tunes. THERES also a lot of talking which is very, VERY annoying indeed.However its not a bad comeback after neing torn apart by eminem and 50 cent, with some quite good lyrics. Quite good.I'm still not convinced that it's as good as some of the reviews say and i think he spends far too much time 'dissin' 50 cent insead of showing him he's actually a better rapper, with tighter beats and capable of making better album's.A good try and not a bad result.For ja- rule."
1,Wow Ja sucks...,"Devote an entire CD towards 50 Cent...wow thats so cool. Ja is an idiot. No one cares about the 50 and Ja beef anymore so why is he trying to revive it? As long as 50 has Eminem and Dre backin him, there is no way Ja will EVER be able to compare. Eminem could destroy every single person in Murder Inc. The G-Unit album is much better and it isn't a stupid diss CD just to Ja. I think it has maybe 1 or 2 songs and thats it. One of them is really old too, so that doesn't even count.Get the G-Unit album this Friday if you want a good CD."
3,OK but could have had more tracks,"This is the latest album from Ja Rule called ""blood in my eye"". It has 14 tracks on, well 1 intro which is not a song. And 3 other skits which means the album has 10 songs on it. It also has on it ""The Wrap"" which was originally released as a mixtape track dissin Aftermath and Shady records, most people already have this track. Ja Rule has hooked up with Fatal Hussein on three of the tracks, Fatal Hussein a former member of the outlawz. Most people know that he has featured Fatal on his album for one main reason to make himself out to be a gangsta like Tupac Shakur because fatal worked with tupac on numerious occassions. all round its an average album save you money."
1,A BLOODY MESS!!!!!!,THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!! 45 minutes of Ja gripin' and complaining about 50 and G-Unit..... silly death threats we've heard before- I WOULDNT PAY 11.99$ FOR A CRY BABY! This guy deserves 2 get served
2,Ja Rule begging of the End,"This album hasnt really been seen in the charts in australia but i gave it a shot and bought it as iam a fan of Ja's ""pain is love"" which i feel is a masterpeice and ""last temptaion"". this album rings more of an underground aspiring rapper rather then someone who had already established themself as one of the biggest rappers of the period.anybody who cares about the Ja' 50 beef raise your hands?, thank you, nobody.... it seems that Ja hasnt let it pass and is still harping on old ghosts. The beats are decent and the rhymes rarely boarder on potent, just as nelly seems to have done, Ja is fading to the background and im not surrised that this album is considered a flop."
3,gettin more cliche all the time,"billboard rappers are a total joke. i am not a big fan of hip hop in general but of course there is some worthwhile stuff out there. this is not it. did you see his interview with farrahkan on tv? please!!! so every body thinks they are gangster, yeah what a total joke. m+m music factory, ok em are you really that tuff, i dont know man if anything you sure would look pretty in a gay bar. and then there is p diddy.. hahaha... total joker.. i dont care how rich he is. fact of the matter is hip hop is played out, it is like glam rock of the 1980's. hopefully something new and fresh will come out and make them all look as ridiculous as they all are. but for now it is the same old same old cliche someday people will look back and laugh but until then you fools will continue buying their records...."
2,Average at its best,"The production is better than his other albums Ja needed to not let his labelmates mess up his album{Blackchild,Tah,Etc.} When the Black Album and Beg for Mercy drops I'll stop listening to this album. Ja you need to step your rap game up"
1,Dissapointing,"Coming from the hip hop mecca, you need to learn how to seperate the exceptional form the fakes. Jay-Z,DMX ,Nas, Biggie, Lloyd Banks known of these are fake, keeping you hooked with gritty lyrics and exceptional word play. Now we come to Ja (im a gansta) Rule who was dissapointed yet again. I did find the loose change diss track good but you can't fix what you broke. Below are reasons why i gave the track 1 star:1)1st album hot, 2nd and 3rd he sold out and sailed up the R'n'B river, and on this one he thinks he can return to a 'gangsta' rapper. Not going to happen2)Clocking in a 45minutes is not even a proper album3)Attempting to go back at 50cent is not going to work , you got beat face it.4)You are a 2pac mimic, let the great one rest5)Increase your lyrics please you may get some fans back that way.Go back to R'n'B where your sell out soul belongs"
4,FAIR is the first step for being a good critic,"I have listened to the album and I was surprised, because its not bad as most reviewers say. I liked the album, it does have good tunes. He criticises the all 50 cent staff wich is in some part bad, but there are songs like ""2 punk ass quarters"" that are shoore to be a hit. As a critic I say that JA RULE is a good singer, and so far he gets my vote. I say it because its been 4 hit albums, and all of them made to the top. 50 cents is a hit but I will only be able to say if he is a good singer or bad on his 3rd album, thats when an artist proves himself."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY$$$$$$!!!!!,I usually don't write music CD reviews cuz most times all cds are about the same-- but this is so important that I have to warn as many people as I can not to buy this album--it is possibly the worst rap (EP!!) ever made by a platinum selling artist....this CD is only worth 2 and a half songs 1. Clap Back 2. The Crown & 1/2. Race Against Time II (first one was better)..THAT's IT...Should have been a CD single..I almost feel bad for Ja....
2,What is Going On?,"This cd is alright. I mean I can understand Ja's anger at Aftermath/Shady/G-unit Records. but I mean to right a WHOLE cd about them is wack. He should do it like 50 and write a good cd and include a diss track or two. But too have a WHOLE CD about 50 is sending one message. He is obsessed with 50/G-Unit and that is not a good thing. It's saying he can only think about THEM. And if you check out his lyrics (since he mumbles so much in the cd) only like three or four bars of a song rhyme. He is telling a story, not rappin'."
1,the most simplistic rap i have ever heard,"Listen up. If you are 12 years old or younger, than this is the album for you. The beats are primitive, the lyrics are elementary and the disses are too late. The damage has already been done to Ja Rule's career. And this album proves it. Too many beats on it that my 3 year old nephew could program and even write lyrics to. It's too bad because Ja Rule used to be an average rapper, but now he is running with toddlers."
1,Ja Rule is a wanksta,"WHO THE HELL DEDICATES A WHOLE CD TO SOME BEEF, JA IS PATHETIC, HE'S TRYING TO BE GANGSTA BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE'S STARING IN SCARY MOVIE 3 AND BEGGING SOME OLD ISLAMIC LEADER TO MEDIATE THE BEEF BETWEEN HE AND 50. 50 IS THE CLOSEST THING TO TUPAC, JA IS THE CLOSEST THING TO A BLACK BACKSTREET BOY.50 DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO 'CLAP' BACK JA IS DONE ALREADY, HE WAS DONE SINCE 50'S DEBUT CD. THE TRUTH IS 50 SAID EVERYTHING THE HOOD WAS SAYING, JA TURNED SOFT, HELL, IF JA GOT SHOT 9 TIMES I DOUBT HE'D LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE ANOTHER BULL S**T ALBUM.50 IS THE S**T, JA IS A WANKSTA"
1,THIS CD MAKES BLOOD GO 2 MA EYES,DIS CD IS G-A-R-B-A-G-E!! N IM SORRY JA BUH YA TRYNA TA BE GANGSTA TOO MUCH N UR NOT PAC OR 50. N DA BEATS R HOT BUH DA RHYMES N HOOKS R WELL JUST HURITN MA EARS.. N YALL COULD HATE IF YA WANT CUZ IM LIKEIN 50 INSTEAD N I SHOULD HAVE NEVA BOUGHT DIS!!
2,Just Retire If You Ever Come Back Like This Again...,"Better get your index finger ready...because it is going to be busy skipping over all the bs in this cd and finding ""clap back"" and ""race against time 2"" the only two good songs on the cd. On the strength of these two songs....because they are very good songs I gave the cd a two. The beef with 50 has taken all air out of ja rule....Even prior to the beef, The Last Temptation was his worst cd until this one...his descent into hip-pop has him straight confused...at least his pop songs are catchy and worth a listen at a party or something. This cd is straight terrible outside of the two tracks listed above. If you can find a ""clap back"" single you are better off copping this and chalking up race against time 2 as a loss. Don't buy unless you wanna hear a cd with whack beats and piss poor cameos by his whack crew the murderers and outlawz outcast fatal hussein."
3,Good for the 9.99 i got it for,"improved his game a bit but some may like him better as a pop rapper than a hardcore one is just as good as 50 cent lyrically but from me i am sick of eminem, ja rule, 50 cent, obie trice chingy, ludacris. Listen to Big L,Little Brother, Pharoahe Monch, Black Star, Ras Kass, Chino Xl, Killah Priest, Raekwon, Canibus, Jedi Mind Tricks, Jeru The Damaja, Gangstarr and tell me that the commercial idiots i just metioned are worth the money they are making and the popularity your great grandmother knows the commercial rappers very few know the underground"
1,If I could i would give it zero stars,How can anyone listen to this without crying themselves to sleep? this is the worst cd ever. ever. period. My opinion is that heihachi iverson is actually Ja Rule himself trying to promote his album here on amazon because after his CD bombed Murda Inc cut his funding.
1,Garabage!!!!!!!,"What the fu*k man! This is surely waste of money. Get ANY rapper except HIM. His Pain is love had some good tracks but this is out of hands. get outta here with ""Ja Rule"" I would rather listen to Briteny Spears (who i hate)Buy any 2pac, Nas, 50 Cent, Biggie or DMX album. pick them up with ur eyez closed and u will love it.F*ck Ja Rule."
4,Blood In My Eye,"This cd came out when everyone was hating on Ja because of that wanksta 50.Ill be honest when G-Unit first came out i was on their bandwagon although i didn't hate Ja,i actually liked Ja and i went to pick up the Beg For Mercy LP the day it came out but they didn't have it but i wanted some type of album to listen 2 so i picked this up.This LP made me not so much a hater of 50 and G-Unit but it made me jump off the bandwagon and now i do think G-Unit is wack except for Banks.But anyway to review this album.While this may not be the typical Ja Rule it is a great album with a lot of good cuts.The stand out track is the only single off the album which is Clap Back.It has a strong beat and shows Ja is hungry.The Crown and both of the freestyles at the end of the album are also good cuts.While this album isn't a classic by any stretch it is still a great album but not for the fan of Ja's more R&B; type music."
1,not that i would know what this trash sounds like,"but all rap is garbage.reading(or trying to read)through all of the ebonics gives me a headache.is spelling easy words wrong that hip!?!?!?!?!?!?!?what would rappers do if sampling REAL ARTISTS' MUSIC were not allowed.i guess rap would fade in a second.not one can play an instrument or sing.they have only 3 things to rap about-money women and(HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)their thug life.if it werent for rappers money,only women over 200 pounds would give them the time of day.if it werent for mindless teens who wear white tee shirts and jeans 10 sizes too big spending their parents hard earned money,rappers would be broke.as for the thug life.....PLEASE!rap is a joke and those who buy it are the village idiots."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!,"This is like the third time I tried to leave a review for this album, to let everyone know how much it sucks, but they never post my reviews."
1,HE TRYS 2 HARD 2 B PAC! HES A INSULT 2 HIM. D.O. CANNON RIP,WUT A JOKE...HE SAID HE WAS GON SLAP DRE? WTF!!! G-UNIT/JAY-Z: 11/14
3,its better the last tempatation,look i guess is better then his last ablums and i dont think he should do RnB and more. look this ablum alright id buy it but i aint really into rap
4,Ja Storms Back,"You have to admit, whether you like him or not, this album is well put together. A lot of things in this album we haven't seen since Venni Vetti Vecci. He's back doing what made him popular in the first place, solid beats and a gangsta attitude.If anything, all of 50 cent's dissing of him is helping his career. It's got Ja back doing what made him sucsessful, and it pays off and shows in this album. I'm a big 50 fan too, and he ironically deserves some credit for motivating Ja Rule to put out something as solid as this.Best Tracks on the CD:#2 The Life#3 Clap Back#4 The Crown#7 Race Against Time II"
5,A Wonderful Book!,"This book will forever have a place on the shelf right next to ""The Worst Journey on Earth"". Sara Wheeler is such a good writer and she brings Cherry to life in a way that perhaps his own book didn't. Anyone who is interested in Polar adventures will surely love this book."
2,Spoiled Elitist Fop Never Did anything of note after Journey,"Tough to scold the author on this since her depiction of 'Cherry' was probably accurate....which raised the question, Is a book about this spoiled relic of the age of the upper class worth it? Here is a chap who ""bought"" his way aboard Scott's expedition through a sponsorship, probably screwed up resulting in Scott's death, and then spend the rest of his life in a self-absorbed, bored, sometimes depressed state, with concerns about the end of ""separation of the classes"". Oh by the way, I have a feeling G.B. Shaw wrote more of Cherry's book than the author of his bio lets on. But seriously, what did this fop do after the ""worst journey"" that was worthy of anything? Not much...which makes me question why we should care about this chap? Bottom line, the author is a fine writer, but her subject is about as interesting as a television test pattern."
3,Meh,"this book was alright from a text and idea perspective but judging by the rich history of mtv's brand from the 80's onward this book failed to actually catalogue any of the actual visual richness of mtv's past and present contribution to graphic and visual design. the images were reduced to lamo frames of video in seemingly irrelevant chronology. a book with all the different versions of the mtv logo would have been more useful. again, if you want to READ about mtv's contributions go ahead and buy it, but if you want to SEE it look elsewhere."
4,Why I use Melatonex,"I have been using this for many years. I have moderate insomnia. I also have Tinitus. I have had the Tonitis for about 12 years. I have developed the ability to 'tune it out' (the ringing in my ear) during the day, but cannot tune it out at night when it is relatively quiet and I am attempting to sleep. Melatonix relaxes my mind slightly and enables me to fall asleep on the nights that I do not take a sleeping pill. It is not a cure, but it does assist."
5,a true solution for insomnia,I have taken Melatonex for years and find it quite helpful. Be sure to buy this brand because it is the most effective. You may not require the entire 3 mg; the tablets are scored and are easily broken. I would recommend trying this brand and continuing with it. I have taken it for approximately ten years without any problems.
1,Didn't Work for Me,"Was really looking forward to trying this out, as was my husband. Unfortunately, neither of us has noticed any difference.I stopped taking them after two tries - for some reason, I had very weird dreams! My husband continued on for about a week, but ultimately said they didn't help him.Oh well. It was worth a try."
3,Interesting but short,"If you own a border collie, or even a dog who is a little on the hyper side, you'll probably find this book to be interesting. At times, the author tries a little too hard to draw some deep significance out of his experience with his dogs. Overall it's an interesting book, especially if you are a dog-lover."
4,Its A Dog's Life,"I love Border Collie's and this is the first Katz book I have read. I had to buy just because of the cover page. Katz does a great job of explaining everything from joy to the trials and tribulations that dog owners and lovers experience every day. It gets a little too cute for me at times, but does a great job sharing with us what life is like with a pet. It is definitely a dog's life."
5,SALUTE MR. KATZ!!,"I just finished reading this book, and LOVED it! I very muchenjoy Mr. Katz' style of writing, and from the moment Devonknocked him over backwards coming out of his crate at the NewarkAirport, I was ""hooked""...what a great story, and Homer...Homeris so adorable on the cover and reading about him made myheart warm, too.I am happy for Mr. Katz to be writing and sharing his experienceswith our four legged friends."
4,The Story of Devon NAS,"A story with a very defined story and characters. Jon Katz has not written a dog book that I have not enjoyed. Not quite as good as two books I read about ""Rose"" but very close. Learning how to re-adjust a dog to like humans and respond to them was very solid and factual. Dogs are amazing once they know that you love them and want what is best for them. It took him time and patience, but it was worth it."
5,great book,"i recommend it to all dog lovers, especially those of us who are partial to border collies. What a crazy breed !"
5,Couldn't get enough of this great book,"I just have to say that I love this book so much. I have 4 dogs 2 rotties,1 yellow lab( she looks so much like your dogs) and a basset/lab. I didn't get them all by choice. But now I wouldn't have it any other way. I have never read any of your books. I haven't even finished it yet .I want to savor it so I am trying to go slow. It's not really working. I just wanted to say that I look forward to reading alot more that you have written and you truly do understand dogs. Keep up the great writing."
3,Warm and moving.,"A good read. I'm recommending it to my ""dog people"" friends.I thought it got kind of boring towards the end; it was much easier to begin than it was to finish the book. Still, worth the read overall."
5,"A Dog Year:Twelve Months, Four Dogs and Me","I can't remember when I enjoyed a book so much. As a previous owner of a 'wild and crazy' Border Collie, who unfortunately found himself in a Manhattan apartment, I found great healing in the adventures of Jon Katz and Devon.He is truly a fantastic story-teller and dog lover of incredible patience. The story was healing for me and unbelievably entertaining. I have recommended it to 'dog nuts' and skeptics alike."
3,Disposable Pets?,"Like many other reviewers have stated, I too wanted to like this book. It was a very easy read, and as an avid dog lover, I really loved hearing the stories of Stanley, Julius and Devon.HOWEVER, I felt that Mr. Katz seemed to view his pets as a disposable item. One gets sick, go get another. As one reviewer stated, it was pretty unfair of him to bring in this dog to upset the lives of his faithful and loyal labs. I felt like in his ""adoption"" of these dogs he made it seem as though he was such a selfless and thoughtful person, when in reality he was only doing it to make HIMSELF feel good.I also didn't appreciate how patronizing he sounded when he spoke of people who adopted shelter animals and then had the audacity to say that those people ended up with dogs with behavioral problems. As a self-proclaimed ""expert"" he should know that a lot of behavioral problems in dogs come from the so-called purebred dogs.All in all, I thought he came across as a little pompous."
1,Dog Killer,"WHat a jerk this guy is. Please do not buy his books. He is the epitome of the stupid, narcississtic dog buyer whose actions fiill our shelters with ""broken"" or ""not quite right for me"" dogs.I hope someday he gets ""broken""and his wife thinks about putting him down. WHat a creep."
1,a big disappointment,"I really admired Jon Katz's ""Geeks"" and I'm deeply interested in dogs, so I pounced on this book, but I'm sorry to say I found it very disappointing. Katz writes well, and some parts of the book are touching, especially his accounts of putting his labs down, but on the whole the book is grating in its misperceptions and obtuseness about canine behavior. It also seemed to be reaching for significance and spiritual insight in a self-conscious way that is occasionally embarrassing. Worst of all, much of it is just not interesting. There are so many insightful and genuinely touching books about the human-canine relationship that this one just seems unnecessary. I hope Katz gets back on stride with his next book."
5,anyone whos ever loved a dog will love this book!,"i truely loved this book. i laughed ,i cried, this book is full of emotions. you really get a true sence of the authors love for his dogs. what a challenge jon katz takes on when he agrees to adopt devon. his devotion love and patience are phenominal and really pay off in the end. i was sorry when this book ended.i wanted to keep on reading about jon and his experiences with his two wonderful dogs. while reading this book i also learned quite a bit about border collies.overall it was a great read!"
4,Wonderful characterizations of his 4-legged friends.,"This was an enjoyable read. I particularly liked Katz's characterizations of his labradors, Stanley and Julius. I'm not a big lab fan, but these two stole my heart. This book is a pretty accurate description of life in a multi-dog household. Katz recounts some very funny experiences with his dogs: one of my favorites was when he retrieved the blue ball from the storm drain."
4,For the love of dogs,"A friend gave me this book since she knew I loved my Labrador Retriever. I had just adopted a stray as a companion for the Lab and experienced alot more difficulty than I anticipated.Reading this book made me realize, how dogs have their own distinct personalities and how when we decide to adopt one, it is a time consuming commitment requiring alot of patience and love.There is a point in the book where he describes beating the dog prompting a driver to stop and chastise him. This was particularly disconcerting to me. Even when my dogs are at their worst, I could not comtemplate the beating Devon had to endure.Overall, I found the book enlighting and have recommended it all my friends that are dog lovers. The wisdom of Mr. Katz helped me find the patience to deal with my little hellion. I can't wait to read his new book on dogs."
5,I finally got to read it,"I bought ""A Dog year"" 3 days ago, I was reading it to my wife, Istopped to take a break. I came back to start reading againand my wife commandeered the book ran upstairs and barricaded herself in our bed room and finished it.We loved ""A dog year"", it's nice to read a fellow dog lover's story."
5,I still can't get over this book ...,"I still can't shake how this book has made my feel about my own Border Collie - Sabot. This book let me know that I am not alone in the everyday, as well as monumental, challenges of owning a Border Collie. I laughed and cried on practically every page. I even hunted down my dog at the end of every chapter to hug and pet him. (I swear he thinks either I'm dying or he is!)If you've ever loved a dog so much that your heart ached, you must buy this book. It will stay with you for a long time. It will show you that dogs are accepting of your human-ness and willing to love you for it anyway."
1,"selfish, self-centered man","The immaturity of this man is astounding. He's got nothing better to do...it's all about him, it's not really about the dogs at all. If it were, Julius and Stanley would have been allowed to live a happier existence without the ridiculous stress brought into their world. One can't help but wonder at their sudden illnesses and death. We all know what stress can do. I stand by my review - a selfish and self-centered man writing for money at dogs' expense."
1,"Write a dog book, make money, cash in, etc......","Same old Jon Katz methods and writing style. Unfortunately it's so insincere and full of contradiction. Ultimately it is completely dishonest and without any heart or soul. See his book ""Good Dog"" (reviews).He should write about pet rocks. He would be considered more an authority in that realm."
3,good book,follow up to Bedlam Farms - never would have bought any of his books if had known what he would do to border collie in last book - a real jackass - hope no one buys anymore of his books - he might have to get a real job
3,Model Boilers and Boilermaking,"If you are looking for information on building model boilers, mostly of the British style, made entirely of copper, this is a book for you. If you are working in 1"" scale or larger, and want to build SAFE boilers made of steel or a combination of materials, this book is NOT for you. There is scant information on American designs, use of steel is discouraged, and the formulae given for calculating safe working pressure does not include a ""safety factor"". ALL steel boilers must have a safety factor figured into the calculations. I could not find any guidance for figuring flat, stayed surfaces, either. I cannot imagine using this work as a guide to building a steel boiler for, say, a 71/2"" gauge or larger American locomotive. But, if you are into copper boilers, go for it."
3,ok,"This product tastes ok but it was really hard to get it to dissolve into a glass of water. Once I finally got it to dissolve it was kind of thick. Decided to move on and try other things, just wasn't for me."
1,Underwhelmed,"After reading the other excellent reviews I'm convinced that I must not have gotten a real Timolino product - the one I received performs very poorly - it doesn't keep hot beverages hot for even 3 hours and doesn't keep cold very long either - less than 5 hours. (Even after letting it sit with hot/cold water first, making sure the pour top was closed and putting the lid on tightly.) Also mine holds 24 not 17 ounces. Having previously purchased 3 other Timolino products which were excellent this one is a huge disappointment. I should have returned it, but had all ready thrown away the box it came in."
3,"Pretty thermos, not as well insulated as hoped!","Our daughter loves her pretty pink thermos, but it doesn't keep milk fresh all day. We send this thermos to day care with our daughter. They don't refrigerate the kids' milk, instead requiring an insulated thermos. This thermos does NOT stay cool enough for this purpose. At first I thought that 8 hours might just be too much, but the milk smells off even after 4 hours.On the other hand, the thermos is a lovely shape and color."
5,Perfect Roadtrip CD!,"Fun, energenic, demented. True to the book, and much, much better than the movie. After you hear this, you'll realize how boring the movie was. The movie was visually disturbing, but no energy in the actors. The CD is pumped, and leaves whatever you want to the imagination."
2,Poor Hunter Imitation,"Perhaps Johnny Depp's ""pretty boy"" reputation masks his acting ability somewhat - this is unfortunate because his Hunter S. Thompson imitation is a million times better than the one on this recording. If you have ever heard Dr. Thompson's rapid, almost rambling voice, you would realize how amazingly accurate Depp's imitation is. If you think this recording makes Dr. Thompson sound ""more spirited"" than the movie, that's fine - but the Hunter S. Thompson on this CD is not as good a mimic as Depp's version. The movie received poor reviews, but as times goes on I believe the film will garner a considerable and well-deserved cult following, as I think it's an excellent adaptation. However, regardless of comparisons to the movie, this audio treatment is merely an average interpretation."
1,Amaturish...,"How can you make Fear and Loathing boring?? I would think it impossible, but it isn't. Spiritless, stoney, monotone, performances from all involved. Several drunk high-school students with some simple recording equipment could do ten times better. Do not buy this CD."
4,catches the tone well,I really enjoyed this adaptation of one of my favourite books. It is funny and having become very familiar with the prose I think it is a faithful attempt by the creators to make something that reflects the material well. It makes me laugh and the main advantage of the format is that I can enjoy the book whilst driving. How cool is that?
2,Not-quite there...,"This spoken word adaptation of the book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is by no means a substitute for the literature. It lacks the depth of character that can be found in the readings and in the recent movie adaptation. Stanton's readings stray closer to William S Burroughs than to Thompson's dry and hurried vocalisms. Jarmusch's New York nasalities do little to support the dramatic text relayed and Chaykin, though he may look the part, speaks in such a thick and guttural feyness that one can't possibly fathom the picture a large Samoan in Gonzo/Lazlo. Regardless, the excerpts used are chosen well and the recording does sound excellent, but I implore anyone buying this to first read the book and to check out the movie as well. Oh, and don't forget about ""Where the Buffalo Roam"" a late Seventies movie gem starring Bill Murray As Hunter. It's excellent..."
4,Feverfew,I began taking this to help with my migraines. So far it does make a slight difference. I am satisfied with this product.
3,Not quite sure,Haven't really noticed a change in my migraines will stop to see if get worse or same. No spence taking stuff even if doc Ozz says so
2,Not helping =(,I've been using the product for about a month now and haven't gotten any results. I will not be purchasing again.
1,Didn't do the trick for me!,I was disappointed that this product did not help me with my headaches! I was hoping for an alternative to my migraine meds.
4,So Fabulous!,"Love, love this appliance, I used to use the stove kettle all the time for teas, Ramen Noodles, instant coffee, and more but this Electric one is super cool I even take it on trips and hook it up to my car adapter and instantly have hot water for whatever I want! Love it, so easy to use and safe too!"
5,Works great,"This electric kettle works exactly how it is supposed to. The water boils quickly and automatically turns off when it is done. Some people complained about it being plastic... while it does smell like plastic, I have never tasted any plastic in the water since the first cup I've made. Just delicious tea taste! It is small enough to hide in my office so I can pull it out when I want to make some tea, and nobody would know! I would recommend."
5,"Works well, no noticable aftertaste in water",I took the time to run several rounds of water through this before using it. I have not noticed an aftertaste now that I have actually used it for tea though it certainly had an odor the first couple of boilings. It is fast and easy. It is also very attractive.
5,Good,"The size is perfect for people who lives alone!Unlike the normal ones which have bases, this one is more convenient to use."
1,Mineral deposits give it a short life,"It is cheap, boils water fast, but does not last. After a couple months, the auto-shutoff feature stopped working. At age 6 months, I have stopped using it due to unsafe mineral deposits on the heating element that are shed into the boiling water as visible particles. The flaw in the design is that the heating element is exposed to the water."
4,Great kettle - spring water causes a lot of calcium build-up.,Overall a great kettle for the price. The calcium build-up is due to the use of spring water. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,use every day,Great way to heat a quart of water for tea or to add to that pot of boiling macaroni. useful tool for any kitchen.
5,Does cut off automatically,Main reason I wanted this product was for the automatic cut-off which operates nicely. I use it for tea so wish it came in black.
1,Cheap,It is made of this cheap plastic and after I washed it a bunch of times it still has a really strong plastic smell and i don't think it is that safe to drink the water out of it. I would recommend a metallic one instead
2,leaves bad taste,"i purchased this tea kettle and no matter what i've washed it with, the water has a funny taste. thought maybe it was me, but recently saw it reviewed by America's Test Kitchen and apparently they could taste whatever it was too."
2,"small,disappointing but cheap","This kettle was small. Of course, it only cost $14. The biggest problem was that it had a plug that had to be removed each time. I got a better one at Tuesday Morning and gave this one to a relative."
1,This is okay if you don't mind your water tasting like plastic,"This mini kettle makes your water taste like plastic. I'm not sure how the others have managed to drink from it. I've tried boiling it out a number of times, but the strong plastic scent and taste remain. That can't be good for you. Also, the cord is extremely short so expect you will need an extension unless you put it right next to the plug. Unfortunately, I will be returning this."
5,Great little teapot,"This is still the best little teapot I've found. I use it to heat water for my cup of Quafeetae every morning.Quafeetae? Well, I was using 2 scoops of Maxwell House Instant Coffee and wanted to use less, but weak coffee is no fun, and green tea is great but wasn't quite enough to get my brain working in the morning, so...I combined them: One scoop of Maxwell House and one green tea bag.But calling it coffee-tea didn't sound very exciting, so I upgraded it to Quafeetae. Do you think Starbucks will pay me for the idea?Back to the Electric Kettle, it keeps on heating and heating and heating, what more could you ask for. I love it."
1,Shorts out,"Ugh! From the day I bought it I had to jiggle the cord to keep it on. I'd walk away, waiting for it to boil, only to discover that it was off again."
1,Auto-shutoff doesn't work,It heats up the water just fine but after five minutes of rapid boiling it still had not shut off. I suppose the shutoff when it boils dry feature works but I didn't let it go that long.The auto shutoff now functions. Slamming it on the counter top seemed to help. I now give it four stars.
1,Why my water cannot be heated?,I am a college student and I always need it in dorm. Why I cannot heat water with this? I just started to use it and I found I cannot use it to have heated water to make coffee or other drinks.. I don't know why...
2,"Works, but not a great design","It does what it purports to; it boils water, plus it's cheap. You get what you pay for.The cord is extremely short, so I often have to unplug it before I pour. Also there is no bell or noise to indicate when the boil is done. But the worst thing is that steam can escape from the switch area at the top of the handle, so if you're not careful you can easily burn yourself when you pick it up right after the boiling stops. I have been burned one before, not fun. If I could afford it, I would buy a replacement, and I wish I had gone with a slightly more expensive model in the first place.tl;dr It does what it says, but the design sucks and can burn you. Get something better if you can afford it."
4,Nice Boiler,"The Procter Silex is a stylish addition to you kitchen counter or to your private cubicle corner where you keep your mini fridge. It boils quickly and detaches from its cord so you can tote the hot water to the table. My only regret is that it's size limits its capacity to 2 mugs or 20 ounces, which makes it unsuitable for preparing hot tea for more than two."
5,Great for college,I use this to heat up water for tea and ramen in my dorm. It's small and heats water quickly. Works like a charm and does what it's supposed to for a great price
4,Good for keeping your stove clear,until we got this product we kept a kettle on the stove and now we do not have to as this product does a great job of heating water fast! Maybe not as fast as I thought it would be certainly no slower than a good kettle. Lite and easy to use. very nice product
5,Does what it suppose to do,"I bought this to take along on trips and it works very well. It doesn't leave any funky odors as described by others. Just fill it up, flick a switch and in less than 5 minutes you have boiling water at your disposal."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER ..THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR LONG,"This has proved to be another piece of garbage, made in china?...or wherever....It will last for only one year and several days.....The several days will make the purchase over the time limit to return this item for a full refund.....I would suggest buying a better brand , that is not made in china ..and will last a much longer time....I will not make this mistake again and will avoid appliances made by this company....Save your money for something better"
1,There's inexpensive and there's cheap,"This product looked like it would last perhaps a month. There was nothing ""finished"" about it. I knew it was inexpensive so I wasn't looking for high quality but I wasn't looking for something that looked like a Made in Taiwan toy."
1,terrible!,The plastic is in bad quality.The boiled water smell like plastic!!!!so do not buy it.I have to return it.
