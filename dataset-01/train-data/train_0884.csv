5,Volume & Control,I love KMS products - although they really through me for a loop when they changed their packaging. This particular products gives me volume for my fine thinning hair and it does not feel sticky.
3,For the diehard fans,"It's an interesting musically historical artifact.If ""Surfin' Safari"" isn't one of your favorite Beach Boys' albums, you can probably skip this one."
5,Sacred Tibet: the Path to Mount Kailash,"This video is awesome!! If you want to see Lhasa and Tibet as it is today, under communist rule, this gives you an idea. The music by Paul Horn is some of his best work."
3,Meh....there's better out there.,"I liked this and Paul Horn has always been a favorite, but Kristofferson's narration seems out of place and the writing and editing are not very polished. Mystic Tibet is much the same kind of trip and orders of magnitude better. This was okay, but it is divided into two disconnected parts, and feels more like an extended YouTube clip than a DVD that they are charging close to $30 for. Personally, this is not going into my collection."
5,One of our favorite cow books!,"We love all the Cow books--I might even love them more than my 3 kids, ages 9,7 and 5! This book covers something we all need to be reminded about--judging people when we don't know them, judging by appearance, or by listening to what other people say about someone and not making our own decision about them... it definitely got me right where it hurt! It's not often you can read a book aimed at young children, and you get a surprise ""sermon"" in there for yourself! The Cow series is definitely not about some boring, simple farm animals. They are fun little characters!"
5,HULK: BUY THIS SG NOW!!! (If you have the game),"Awesome! Please buy it if you have the game. It covers the PS2, XBOX AND GameCube versions! Buy."
1,A profound disappointment!,"This is how I think it worked. Three well known individuals are asked to have sort of a brainstorming session on innovation. Nothing much happens and nothing really significant surfaces but the verbiage fills one chapter. After that one of the three authors probably asks a graduate assistant to contact the public relations departments of a few companies. The material received is sort of being edited and... voila, you have a book. I don't know if there was an honest effort put into this but what I know is that this book was totally unhelpful."
4,Y&T's first is good hard rocking debut 76?,This debut from 76' is amazing and howit didn't get any attention is ashame.I remember seeing the ad for this inCreem [rock magazine from 70's] nextto KISS Alive! My friends laughed butI didn't but I never heard it until Igot the album in the 80's. It's hardrock but very raw & Meniketti doessome great long solos on some songs.Features 25 hours a day & BeautifulDreamer from the 80's best of CD. Ifyour into good 70's hard rock or Y&T;get it! But it's available on Y&T;website with Struck Down 2cd set!don't pay this outrageous price!
3,"Does okay... Still, there are better.","Having owned SnapStream products in the past, these do a fairly decent job, especially for those who wish to transfer their recorded TV shows to another device, such as a PSP, or a Pocket PC, this will convert your TV shows to those formats. However, the quality of HDTV just doesn't compare to Vista Home Premium's own Media Center. I would probably recommend that one go with Windows Vista Premium or Ultimate, or MCE 2005. There are other programs that can convert TV recordings better than Beyond TV to an MPEG format for other devices."
2,beyond tv works sometimes,beyond tv program took several installs and uninstalls to finally get to work.have dual boot system software is very squirrely on vista 64.no support for hd channels.took over computer on xp 64 even changed web pages ie if i type in bestbuy somehow it goes to snapstream?thought ATI 650 tuner was problem purchased happauge 1600 tuner made 10 time worsefinally gave up in vista 64runs most of the time in xp 64just have to becarefuli have amd x2 5000 with sli evga 8800 gts'4 gig ram 2 maxtor 250 gig hardrives on asus a8n32 board so i dont think hard ware is problemincluded remote took over pc and did whatever it felt like doing.support is limited to all the other poor souls forund out on the forums basically non- exsistent.beyond media software never worked right !!!!
1,Worst book I have ever read.,"This book is just a manual on how to make your kid misirable by spanking him and pain. The father is bigger, then he has to use his force to correct the kid. I think parents are smarter too, so they can use the intelligence to make their childs change."
4,Worked just as I hoped it would,"I bought this product for an extended US train journey to avoid carrying four separate chargers for two non-compatible cell phones and two non-compatible e-readers. It worked great, seems sufficiently robust given careful use, and saved me a huge mess of plastic bricks and wires. My only real gripe is that the carrying pouch supplied is not big enough for all the parts. It's not easy to stuff everything in there, and you end up with a pretty awkward package. But the bits work, and the product's flexibility is great."
1,"Does not last, warranty is not being honored","Lasted few months, then started acting on/off, eventually died. Tried to file a warranty claim, but it is not so easy -- no such form to be found on the manufacturer's site. Eventually received one email from support, and no follow up at all. Waste of time and money. Plenty of good products and companies out there, stay away from iGo."
1,waste of money,"If you have never coached a youth team this could be a good book about coaching in general ... but is not very helpful with targeting volleyball skills, drills, techniques. Disappointed in my purchase."
3,Not too bad,"The CD is ok. I bought a bunch of other ones as well. Make sure you have a computer that has Windows XP, or one of the systems listed on the CD.The seller shipped right away, and I got it within two days."
4,Cary Grant at his best.,"Cary Grant is suave, debonair and utterly charming. Laraine Day is at her prettiest. The tune Cary whistles throughout the movie stays with you. Good supporting cast. Cary's knitting scenes are priceless."
3,A Darker Role for Cary Grant,"It's hard to find a Cary Grant film that I don't like-he is one of my favorite actors of all time. In a different sort of role, Grant plays a very dark character who is running a gambling outfit on a ship. This film isn't his typical light-hearted, will he get together with the girl story. Grant shows that his acting is more than one dimensional-he can play roles of all types. This isn't one of my favorite Grant films, but I'm glad that I watched it."
4,Disappointed,"We bought this for our young girl for Christmas and she loves it. Ours did not have the volume control, and we also had to put layers of tape over the speaker to make it bearable. However, after a week the pages would not turn correctly, and so we are going to take it back. I will try to get a new model with the volume control and hope that this other problem has been fixed as well."
2,fun when it works,"I purchased this toy for my 3 year old daughter at the time who has learning disabilities but LOVES music, so I thought it would be great...She LOVED playing with it with her sister up until about a month or so of owning the toy and the microphone breaking..Replaced batteries several times and didn't do any good..Still a broken toy with a great concept and would be wonderful if it worked properly...It was a waste of money spent on a toy in which I no longer had a receipt for which went straight to the trash...."
4,You will need ear plugs,"I bought this item as a learning tool for my daughter. The problem is this toy is dangerously loud. I need to cover the speaker with my hand or a towel in order for it to be tolerable to use. I am very disappointed, especially because it was made by Fisher Price, who should know better.My daughter loves the music and loves dancing to it but again the volume of this toy is ridiculous."
3,It Broke After 1 Week!,"I got this toy for my three year old daughter. She seemed to like it okay, but after a week, the pages stopped rolling. I changed that batteries, but that didn't correct the problem. Don't waste your'e money on this toy!!!!"
1,TOO LOUD,"This is a great idea, however, it is way too loud. My 2 yr old son loved this toy in the store, but was scared of it out of the box. It was returned to the store the next day even the customer service clerk couldn't believe a toddler's toy could be so LOUD(no problem returning it even ripped out of the box)."
2,This toy is sooooo loud!,"My son received this gift as a Christmas present and he really enjoys it. However - I absolutely cannot tolerate the volume. You cannot understand how loud it is - I believe one of the other reviewers when they say it exceeds recommended decibel levels. I just went to check for the ""hidden"" volume control - it does not exist on ours. Perhaps I will ""fix it"" with tape and cardboard, but for the moment, it is staying in the off position! Clearly not made by people with children, or maybe by the time it hit the market, their ears had already been damaged. This toy has made me look very closely for volume switches on all other toys I now buy."
2,Disappointed,"I have bought this toy--twice. Actually, I had to return the first after it stopped turning the ""pages"" after a month. Well, it happened again and brand new batteries are not the answer. My sister has had the same problem with the one she bought for her daughter. She is not too concerned though because she rarely could stand to have her children play with it because it really is too loud.I said ""LOUD!"" I originally bought this as a nice car toy, but once in the car, the music reverberrates and can give you a headache in three minutes flat--it's that loud. I know nothing about a volume control.I really wish the makers had worked a bit harder with this toy because it really does have great potential as a teaching and learning tool."
4,A sucessful gift that I have never seen!,"I recently purchased ""Learn through Music: Dora the Explorer"" along with one other educational accessory as a Birthday Gift for my great-niece who will be two on July 26th. I didn't really know what to buy for her but ended up being convinced by what other people had to say about this product. Since I live in Brasil, I do not have access to this product and hence, I took the chance and bought it. Would you believe that my niece (the baby's mom) called me the other night informing me that the gift had arrived and that my great-niece would not let go of it. She was thoroughly thrilled by the music and by everything else this educational product offers. Indeed it was certainly the right gift to buy! My niece (the baby's mom) said that I would probably end up being her favorite great-uncle! I thank all for your help for assisting me in my choosing this marvelous ""unseen"" gift!!"
2,Way Too Loud,"We bought this for my 2 year-old daughter who just loves Dora, but she is scared to death of the thing! We even have the one with volume control! The soft volume is not soft. It's more like very loud and extremely loud. She also doesn't care for the rolling screen. The other children who have played with it seem to enjoy it, although it moved too slow for the 4-year old I care for. I can't really say how educational or durable it is. We rarely use it since my daughter won't even stay in the room when it comes out."
5,A Little Disappointed,"Bought this toy for my 18 month daughter for Christmas, the microphone broke within the first couple of weeks, (this I could live with) BUT the VOLUME is driving me crazy. Some people say that you have to put the on/off switch in the middle but it doesn't work with mine. I'm surprised that Fisher Price would make a toy without a seperate volume control, especially with children so young. Overall a cute toy, but beware of the volume."
4,Not for Casual Listening,"I'm both enchanted and distracted by the narrator's Irish accent (hard to detect at first). After several listenings it became apparent and now, for me, seems to overshadow the message itself at times. A verrry looong prayer. Beautiful nonetheless. The spoken words are enhanced by background music, which in itself is not memorable when I try to recall it. The prayer starts with New Age imagery and morphs into traditional pleas for, and affirmations of, the Creator's loving guidance and protection. Requires one's full attention and plenty of time to hear it straight through for maximum effect. The affect: a peaceful, positive, uplifted feeling!"
4,came perfectly protected in excellent shape,great item and fast service from the seller - i got this before I expected it! Was smaller then i thought although that was my fault NOT the sellers
5,Got a CZ .22?,"I had a hard time finding the ""perfect"" scope mounts/rings for my CZ512, with the 11mm mounting grooves in the top of the receiver, but these are it. And they didn't break the bank either. Highly recommended."
5,Death Metal At It's Best!!!,"Fleshcrawl really kicks ass on this cd, the deep vocals get thrown at you non stop. Everything on this cd is flawless, everything sounds great this is one hell of a cd. This cd is hard to find, but if you get a copy you will be happy you did. If you want some good death metal here it is, non stop in your face lethal assault. I highly recommend you add this to your cd collection if your into death metal."
5,"Works great, with a great price","Installed on a 94 Chevy K1500 with a 350/5.7L (tune up). Installation was easy and for me the rotor fit just fine (other reviewer had a problem).The rotor is a tight fit, you just need to make sure it is lined up correctly and press down firmly(possibly wiggling it a little). Also make sure the cap is lines up properly and it is an easy install. Seems to be of good quality and should last me a long time. Only have had it on for about 100 miles, but so far no problems here."
3,Accel did not excell,"I purchased the Accel 8132 cap and rotor. The CAP fit my '94 Suburban, but the Rotor didn't. I had to go buy another rotor locally. Amazon was very accommodating and refunded me the cost of the second rotor. That was great. Amazon did offer me a full refund of the set plus they offered to pay my shipping costs, but I had installed the cap and didn't want the hassle of removing it. I think Amazon offers Excellent customer service!"
1,Are 3 junk games better than 1 good game?,"NO! Go spend your allowance money on a good game like Medal of Honor or Driver, rather than this ""trilogy"". Just in case you're curious, here's what the three games consist of:PART 1 - a poorly made third person shooter with bad graphicsPART 2 - a poorly made rail shooter where you follow the exact same path again-and-again (like an arcade lightgun game)PART 3 - a poorly made driving gameI literally played this trilogy for forty-five minutes (15 minutes each game), and I was already sick of it. If these games were movies, they would be the equivalent of poorly-made home flicks. Grade Z."
2,"Good for 50ft connection, horrible feedback on Subwoofer","Used this for a 50ft run in the wall for a subwoofer connection, and the Feedback was horrible. I then purchased a LFE coaxial cable for only 15$ with shipping, and the sub worked perfectly with the new cable without any feedback. These cable may be good for regular audio signal from a DVD player to a TV, but for a subwoofer do not purchase."
5,A brilliant emotional story,This is a sad story which is not fit for children. IT is an emotional rollacoaster and a extremely exciting video.It is worth all the money.
2,Product is Defective,"I'm so very dissapointed!!!!! I was looking forward to finally watching the Roots 7-disc, unfortunately, it's defective--skipsand has a humming sound as music plays in the episode. I don't recommend purchasing this product."
1,Very Poor qualkty copies of the mini series,I was extremely disappoint in this set of Disc. Each one of the seven disc had spots in them when the audio fast forwarded and the voice and action became out of sequence for a while. They were terrible copies. I was an effort to watch and I was very disappointed
2,Roots 25th anniversary dvds,"I purchased these dvd's for my daughter for her birthday. Even though they arrived very fast,they were dirty and skipped. my daughter said she cleaned them with soap and water, wiped with a soft cloth, then they played without skipping.I was very disapointed because she had wanted these, and they didn't arrive clean as expected."
1,I'd rather my old VHS copy....,"I spent $39.00 on this miniseries. I have loved the series since I was a child. I had previously owned it on VHS, but my copies were nearly 20 years old and the picture quality had severy diminished. I purchased it on DVD and to my surprise, THERE IS NO AUDIO!!! No matter how I try to play with settings on my DVD player or my television, THERE IS NO AUDIO. I wish I hadn't already thrown away my VHS copies..."
5,Love it!,I remember watching Roots when it came out on TV the first time. There were many parts that I had forgotten. I almost got through the entire series in one weekend. I truely have enjoyed every minute and glad I purchased this 7 disc set for my libiary.
2,roots four-disc 30th anniversity edition,This purchase was a waste of money and time. The story was so butchered that it was hard to grasp the story. There was only about two cd's worth of veiwing. The rest somebody telling how they made the film.etc.
2,Nice try but Don't Be Fooled,"After reading the book Roots I was in great anticipation of seeing the movie which was to be shown on the Hallmark channel for its annivesary. I was expecting a great movie because the book was excellent. I was very disappointed I didn't even watch the entire movie. A large portion of the story which dealt with Kunta's childhood and the development of his mentality was left out and foolishness was added in its place. I must admit I must admit that even though the movie was inaccurate and probably changed to incorporate different views or as not to make things seem so bad, it did bring awareness to slavery a much shunned subject in our society.Read the book instead its way better."
1,Wont work here in Australia.,"I purchased this item a few weeks ago from America, however, it is not compatible with either my DVD player or my laptop and am stuck with a DVD that is unwatchable."
1,An elaborate hoax,"Before anyone buys this video, they should be aware that most of this story, which was supposedly based on Mr. Haley's investigation into his ancestry, was proven to be a hoax, while other parts were simply stolen from other sources. Let the buyer beware!"
1,When Will it Ever End?,"More fiction and plagiarism designed to demonise the South, divide the races, fill the coffers of Jessee Jackson and politicians who claim to have the answers, encourage liberal whites to wallow in guilt and shame, insult blacks with paternalism at its very worst: Treat them like children; they can't handle the truth. To quote STANLEY CROUCH, a black columnist for the New York Daily News; ""The book remains an opportunistic insult to black people, and no amount of excuses will change that harsh fact."""
5,The Greatest and Most important film i have ever seen,"there is nothing else like Roots for me in my lifetime. there isn't another film or story that captures my emotions,feelings and sprit like this Film. I have the Vhs, DVD of the 25th anniversary and also Roots The Gift. this is a National Treasure that needs to always be told.this Film and Story will make you Angry, it will make you examine your own History and also your family tree. the Most Powerful Program that i have Ever seen Bar none.Props always to Alex Haley."
5,the greatest movie ever and saddest,i enjoyed this film and it was powerful.it's sad and it can get to you.alex hailey brillantly leds us back to africa and back to the usa.very solid cast.this film should always be required viewing.it's a story alot of people don't understand the pain and sorrow and history of this country.it's an endless reflection of the usa and it's history that should be viewed by all.
4,Roots- Television's Best/DVD Could Be Better,"This series changed my life, and everyone's life who watched it. Unfortunately, there is an audio glitch on the second disc (episode 3). When the actual episode begins, the music sounds as if someone accidentally turned it all the way down, then back up again. This is a shame as it has nothing to do with the remastering of the film, but rather a technical goof when transferring. If Warner would fix this glitch, the disc would rate 5 stars."
3,Missing DVD,I loved the movie! Watching it as an adult was like seeing it again for the first time. I just wish I could have watched the entire movie from the beginning. My box set was missing the first DVD (the first two parts). Kunta's Africa and early experiences were far too important to skip over.
2,movie lover,"the cd was poor quality, the movie kept freezing in all the cds. it seemed like a pirate cd and not worth it at any price.sorry but i do not recommend this product."
1,defective,i ordered this on returned it order another one and had to return it too because they are all defective. they all keep jumping back all through the dvd. i wish i could get on that doesnt skip. it is a story that everyone should watch.
4,Roots,This was purchased as a Christmas present for a friend of mine...the gift was enjoyed even though the Post Office didn't deliver it properly...he is very happy with this gift
5,I just bought it...,"I live in the UK but a friend is over in Canada visiting so I took the oppourtunity to get Roots as it is not available in the UK. I read the book and then watched the whole movie on VHS as a teenager while living in Nigeria. The book is incredibly moving and from my re-collection the movie was true to the book. I can't wait to get it in my hands which should be in about two weeks. Hurrah! I also purchased ""Gods must be Crazy"" on DVD which is in a completly different genre but equally enjoyable in a different way."
3,damaged goods!!!,This product was great up until the 6th disc with the last episode and that disc was so badly damaged it wouldn't play. so I would not recommend this supposedly brand new copy as it obviously was not brand new! This is the first time I fell lied to and cheated by Amazon! I was highly disappointed by this! How do I return it for a refund?
4,Roots,I really believe this movie is informative if not always correct. It is truley sad to think about the terrible things some of us are capable of
5,Roots,Was very impressed with the anniversary edition but would have loved to have the original clip from Roots. All in all it was a great selection.
4,Great Story,I personally think all families should experience this movie. Inspiring and heart felt even thou it was so deep and tragic. I enjoyed it.
4,New Light,I watched the roots series when it came on T.V. sometime ago. It was a pleasure watching it again. This time I saw things that I didn't see before. I will give this DVD to my grandchildren so they can see how really important family is.
2,roots 30 ediition,"The program was great, but the dvd's had skips in them and the words spoken were not in sync with their mouths. I had to keep stopping and replaying the dvds. I probably should have sent them back and had a new ones sent to me. Pat F"
4,Roots,"I have always loved the movie, Roots. It was hard to watch when it first came out and it was even harder to watch now. I got this DVD for my son to watch because not a lot of Black history is taught at his school and he needed to see where we came from. He and his friends use the ""n"" word too much and I wanted him to understand how this word came to be and why it is unacceptable in everyday language.This movie also was instrumental in giving me pride in my black heritage. Blacks were made to feel as though they were an ""inferior"" race of people and because of the ""Roots"" movie and the book author, Alex Haley, I know I have the right to be proud of who I am, and to appreciate our ancestors who shed blood for the freedom we now enjoy."
5,"5 stars for Roots, Zero Stars for the DVD","OK, the DVD is great, nice extras, and Roots is one of my all-time favorite pieces of television. But for some reason, the DVDs turn the subtitles on automatically! I saw at least one person below is having the same problem.It's madness! Even when you turn them off from the DVD's menu, THEN turn them off AGAIN from your DVD player's subtitle function, they STILL return.AAAAHHHHHRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!!BWWAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!This is a major distraction. I have a Toshiba SD-1600, which is a pretty decent little DVD player. I've never had any problem like this before.If anybody has a solution (short of putting electrical tape over the bottom third of my TV screen) I'd love to hear it. Otherwise, Roots is goin' back."
5,The Epic Production: ROOTS!!!,An honest and passionate portrait of American History. Great Movie from beginning to end.Loved:Levar Burton and John Amos' portrayal of Kunta KinteBen Vereen as Chicken GeorgeLeslie Uggams as Kizzie
5,sweeping and emotionally touching,"Roots did much for the historical enlightenment of Blacks ,but to a larger degree for all of America too. People of all groups could possibly see the injustice all people have suffered at one time or other. Its a lesson we should all remember so that history,again, does not repeat itself."
1,Roots (Seven Disk 3th Anniverary Edition,"I ordered this DVD twice and had the same problem with both disks. On disks one and two, I could not launch the movie. On disks 3 through 7, movie could be seen but not video. This was a great disappointment as I did so want to watch this movie again."
4,"movie series great, but dvd quality needed","This was a great movie series with some ""soul"" and excellent characterization, and hated to see it end. But the dvd quality was poor in some areas, and had to fast forward and skip some scenes due to bad sectors on dvd."
2,Warner Screwed Up Something Good Again,"Having the Roots miniseries on DVD is great, but as soon as I opened the lousy cardboard case that Warner used, I noticed my discs were already beginning to scratch. The case folds and nothing is protecting the discs from the cardboard. I have never seen a big movie company be so cheap that they can't even use decent packaging. Most DVD buyers are buying them to last a long time, but apparently Warner doesn't see it that way. I give this a low rating because of the poor packaging. I feel sorry for anyone who orders it and may have a damaged case. Where would you be able to find such cheap piece of cardboard to replace the case?"
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"Waited patiently for my Roots Dvd.Very disappointed! The first disc froze and then once it got going it went back to the place where it started before it froze.Next disc just kept freeing!!Returning for a refund, however I will look to purchase again(hopefully not a double sided dvd."
1,ROOTLESS,"DVD'S were delivered promptly. The packaging was in excellent condition. HOWEVER, EACH OF THE SEVEN DISKS IN THE 30th ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF ROOTTS, Humg and skipped making viewing difficult, and eventually impossible to view with any contimuity.. It's possible this is an isolated defect, I think not. This was advertised as a new product, not used. I attempted to view on my computer and two different players, all with the same result."
3,roots,"it has problems!!!!at the end of each chapter i have to manully make it go TO THE NEXT CHAPTER... in order to watch movie... but discs are clean,movie was great"
2,Dissappointed,Definately NOT what i expeced. Simply a lot of trailers. Too much of a hassle to return. Must read throughly before ordering again.
5,Best miniseries there was for TV,"I watched parts of this series when it was first on TV, but wanted to see it in its entirety. My wife and I spent three nights (two disks each night) watching and could not wait for the next night. Great story and thought some of the events are rather dramatized I think it is generally solid with not too much artistic liberty taken. The story itself is compacted (vs the book), but the basic storyline is there, and to be appreciated. Like so many dramatizations it is not for everyone, but it is something that anyone can enjoy if they give it a chance."
4,Moving story. Great acting. Some sets were totally unrealistic,"Amazing story. captures some of the really bad brutality of slavery. Slave ships, whipping, manicles.But the slave cabins were all wrong. Belle's ""slave cabin"" looked like it belonged to a middle class white family of that era. The room was large. Painted walls. Windows with glass panes and white dividers. nice furniture. A carved head board on the bed with a nice quilt. Shelves for holding things in the kitchen.I've seen pictures of Thomas Jefferson's slave cabins. thin mats on wood floors for sleeping, no windows, very small rooms, about the size of a modern bath room, very dusty and dirty. And Jefferson's were supposed to be better than most."
3,Roots DVD,"good movie,but the DVD has a small hesitation about every 30 minutes throughout the movie. Just a bit distracting."
3,Disappointment,This DVD set is not what I expected as far as quality goes. When I purchased the 30th Anniversary Edition I assumed it would be a very good rendention of the original film. There are many places in the disks that the voice track and the picture on the screen do not mesh. Very disappointed in the quality. The actors mouths will still be moving 30 seconds after the voice track ends.
5,A must see and share,I enjoyed this movie when it aired on TV years ago. I just wanted to share the experience with my children and grandchildren. They have seen it and they were glad that I bought this DVD.
2,hard to return when disk 3 of 3 does't work,roots was good.but after watching 2 of 3 discdisc 3 of 3 did not work.it is hard to return.
1,Poor quality,The DVD begins to skip on Disc 1. Never made it to the 2nd Disc. Took it out to make sure it was clean. Started skipping again. Tried to skip ahead a few minutes to see if it was just a bad spot in the movie but that didn't work either. Would start over for no reason. Tried on another DVD player but did the same thing. Very disappointed and will be returning.
4,"""Roots"" videos",I purchased the set for my husband for Christmas and we've already enjoyed two episodes. The second tape had a couple of minor glitches but it didn't spoil the wonderful experience of watching this monumental mini-series again after 33 years! We like having it on video instead of DVD because it's easier to stop and start if we're interrupted. All in all (so far) we're happy with our purchase.
2,Missing alot,"I was able to watch the original series on tv in 1977 & enjoy history, but this cut 4 dvd version is pathetic. To many scenes removed, that gives a greater understanding of the story. I wouldn't recommend you buy this set as the original was awesome not this cut down version. I would have paid for a 5/6 dvd set to include the scenes that has been removed."
2,Roots,The complete story was not there. There was a lot more to the actual Mini Series. We felt that we had been cheated.
2,"I loved the story, but sorely disappointed in DVD quality","I thought I was losing my mind. I, like so many others, was eagerly anticipating my favorite miniseries release on DVD; however, I am having the same problems (on my second copy) with the unwanted subtitles (I'm using a Toshiba SD-1600 as is another reviewer, and this is the first time this has happened). I'm keeping my copy because I loved the story so much (can't wait for Roots: The Next Generation, but I hope WB does come up with some solution."
3,Roots,It wasn't as good as I remembered it. I think entertainment has improved greatly since it was made. Can't go higher than a 3 ! JosieBear1951
1,"I love the story, however",There are 7 discs and they all skipped. The 6th one flipped over to a silent commentary that shrunk the picture.
5,Roots (Seven-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition) (2007),My wife wanted this for years years.Ordered it on Friday it was here next day but waiting for a rainy weekendto watch it.
3,Not my favorite Hemalayaa video,"I loooove Hemalayaa's workout videos and have purchased several, but I was disappointed with this one. It is not a true ""workout."" I ended up switching to a different Hemalayaa video and finished my workout without finishing this video. I would not buy this particular video again, but I would recommend Hemalayaa's other videos for a great and fun workout. My favorites are ""Bollywood Booty"" and ""Bollywood Dance Workout."" I also enjoyed ""Yoga for Everyone."""
3,Not exactly a workout...,"Though it's listed with the other ""fitness"" videos, this really can't be considered a workout. It is an excellent relaxation style routine that could be done early in the morning or before bed. I just went through the routine for the first time and found it tough to get in to. There's a lot of ""do whatever you feel - whatever comes natural"" - which is nice - but I prefer a more defined routine (for instance, Dolphina's Goddess Workout - the Beginner's video would be more what I expected out of this). I may give this one another shot in the future, but for now it's just not my cup of tea."
2,I'll Sell You All the Brooklyn Bridge,"Ok, I have no idea how to begin this review. I thought this had nothing to do with the Kama Sutra, I was disappointed. And this is supposed to be a very improved DVD from her other videos. You are kidding me right. Let's put it this way, I could have made this video and sold it to you all. I cannot send it back to the seller because I am not happy with the video, but I am going to honest and let the next person know my opinion. Again this is just my opinion. I am putting it out to re-sell on Amazon, and despite the fact that it may hurt my chances of selling it, so please be buyer conscious. This is my first video by Hemalayaa, bought the 'Beautiful Belly' DVD as well and again not the best. So that was the last DVD by Hemalayaa. Sorry, but I had to be honest."
1,Dance of the Kama Sutra,"Really not worth getting. This is a simplified, sexy version of yoga. You'd be better off getting a yoga workout dvd."
2,i am not happy with this dvd,really is not a dvd for who want to learn something..the lady only dance \i am not happy at all
3,Sexy but not Skanky,"This dvd is not only sexy and empowering, but also relaxing. I liked the opening the heart portion at the beginning. It is a lot of writhing on the floor, but it's not all floor work. Some of the moves are a little uncomfortable, especially if you're overweight, but I suspect to feel comfortable each time I do it. I wouldn't consider it a workout, but I was sweating by the end. It makes you feel good about being a woman and it makes you feel good about yourself. I felt sexy all through this dvd."
4,PROS & CONS,PROS:-A slow dance that helps you get in touch with your inner goddess.-This dance is a great way to pamper yourself and nourish your soul.-Teaches you how to look and move seductively.-Teaches you to love and respect your body.CONS:-An inordinate amount of time is spent on basic eye and neck movements.-THIS IS NOT A WORKOUT VIDEO. Very few calories will be burned. This is a slow dance with yourself.
2,"Great for meditation, not for much else","If you are viewing this to learn more about the Kama Sutra, or for a workout, or to learn some dance moves, you will be disappointed. The eye exercises gave me a headache and I had to shut the DVD off and watch the rest of it later. I think this dvd WOULD be useful for meditation, if you are into that sort of thing. Hemalaya is so blissed out and adorable--I'll have whatever she's on! I do enjoy her as an instructor, but I prefer some of her other DVDs over this one.What I was able to take away from this is her flirtatious glances, her smiles, and how she looks toward and then away from her audience, drawing you in. This DVD is well-made and beautiful and is more about channeling yourself then about a particular move or exercise."
2,Not great...,"It shredded paper until I started doing a whole load of it... Completely jammed up on me and over-heated... I took it apart, cleaned it and put it back together... still no go. Might consider buying a slightly more expensive shredder if you plan on shredding that backed up amount of mail you have on your desk..."
4,"A funny, quick read that will amuse even non-baseball fans","This is a great summer beach book. It is fairly well written and very funny. Even if you do not like baseball, you will find this book to be entertaining and fun. It has sharp dialog and some of the humor had me laughing out loud. I was reading it on a plane and I am sure I annoyed my fellow travelers with my loud laughter. On a serious note, I was impressed with how the author made me feel for and understand a wide variety of characters - an aging ballplayer, a young hotshot, etc. The ending was a bit predictable, but overall, a fun fast read with some great humor."
4,Fun read for gay sports fans,"This is an older gay-themed romance novel, before the onslaught of the explicit ""erotic"" novels that pass for gay literature today. I enjoyed this book for three reasons: 1) it's very authentic in representation of sports world; 2) characters r no stereotypical gays; 3) there is not a lot of graphic sex. The main hero is realistic jock type who keeps to himself. Internal dialog shows his emotions and his reservations about his feelings. There is a lot of sports talk in this novel, and much focus is put on the team's progress. I loved the tension buildup, both romance and sports. Most gay novels today have no plot or tension because everything relies solely on sex scene on top of sex scene, and not too good of ones. I would highly recommend this novel to fans of baseball and for good gay literature the way it use to be."
2,Idea better than actual product,Product rusted at seams after first use. Some of the shapes did not turn out well once the cookies were baked. Many of the shapes had thin areas which ran together as the cookies baked making the shapes look poor.
1,Very disappointed!,"The watch is beautiful, but the stones started to fall out after about three weeks of wear. I was very disappointed with the quality of this watch. I would not recommend it."
3,Great model,Great model and fun. This not toy but hobby model. This some rare to find cost but this good deal.
4,Nurses rule!,"Back Cover description: ""You want me?"" Caroline Frisby was right for the job--after all, she'd established an excellent rapport with the little boy while he was in the hospital in England. It only made sense that she be the one to supervise Marc's recovery back home in Holland. But was she the right girl for the man? Marius van Houben, the boy's uncle, was rich, attractive and successful--and very single. He could have any girl he wanted. What were the chances that he would want her? Caroline knew that they were one in a million.Heart-warming story as usual. Great lead characters, the plot moves and a happy ending, what more could you want."
2,"Please refrain from using the word ""punk""","I flinch every time I hear somebidy calling this a punk CD. It is soft-core EMO, and a notch above TRL. However, if that is what you're looking for you will certainly like this album. The songs are well written and often a pleasure to listen to, though there are no surprises for those who already own More Betterness. Despite its positive qualities a cannot bring myself to recomend this CD. There are simply too many more better written, better performed songs by bands that are still part of the genre that these guys profess."
1,Not Digging It. At All.,"Well I'm one of those over thirty dudes who thinks this album is not up to NUFAN standards.Gone are subjects like domestic abuse, AIDS, war, and other issues that allow me to tolerate ""love"" songs. This is just about all love songs, and reeks of an attempt to lure fans of bands like A Simple Plan, i.e. bands that longtime fans of NUFAN tend to despise. It's almost as if they went out of their way to lose me as a fan.I've said it before and I'll say it again, bands are allowed to do what they want, write what they want, play what they want, but I don't have to like it.There's just no bite to this. To be fair, it doesn't stray too far from the NUFAN sound musically (it's watered down, but you can tell it's them), but lyrically and subject-wise, this could have been written by 15 year olds."
2,They should have called it more betterness 2,"It must the only melody they got left..The songs remain IDENTICAL - drumming identical. guitars identical. bass identical. vocals ABSOLUTLEY identical, down to every harmonious lift at the end of each sentence from repetitive Tonys' voice.NUFAN are always good. and i can see this album being a hit with 16 year old girls who are 'punk' for this years fashion,,, or better yet, guys that own every pennywise album to impress those girls.After hearing the cool hi-hat intro on song 2, i thought it was gonna be good....alas it was spoiled by monotony.:( i knew every tune before they played it.2 stars if you are an existing No Use fan3 & 1/2 if you're a new No use fan"
2,"MTV fans like it, real fans don't","For some bands this would be a very solid album. All the blink 182 wannabes would make their quick buck releasing an album like this. It's full of simple and catchy melodies that are easy to sing along to. Sounds good, right? The problem is that No Use For A Name has been in the scene almost as long as anyone, releasing quality punk rock the whole time. After all that it is an insult to release an album so watered down with shallow lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I do listen to this and enjoy it. But I can find the same enjoyment from the riddlin kids, bowling for soup, or simple plan. Atleast those bands are being themselves. Who knows? Maybe times were tough for NUFAN and they needed a quick buck. But when I put in a record from a veteran punk rock band I want to hear some real punk rock. This was a disappointment."
3,Fat Wreck Chords is the way to go!,Hello you can buy this cd at the fatwreck chords website for 10 dollars! Yay! Well anyway this cd is pretty cool. It would be even cooler if a different band put out the exact same cd.
4,Slick production,"I can't believe i would be saying this about this band but this album is super slick even compared to More betterness which kinda sucks, this album has much better songs but it sounds a little over produced. The best songs are , ""international you day"", the way too poppy, ""dumb reminders"", ""any number can play"" , ""solitaire""."
4,"If you have this book, you can photograph a bride.","One of the reasons I like Amherst Media's books is because everything is spelled out in easy to understand terms and visuals are always provided. ""The Art of Bridal Portrait Photography"" by Marty Seefer isn't any different. The author holds nothing back and shares his experiences as an award winning photographer as a true teacher would.Subjects covered include: Portraitist vs. Journalist, Previsualization, Metering, Film Tests, Planes of Exposure, studio shooting, Location Portraits and a Bridal Study Suggestion Sheet. Also covered are Studio Lighting, Lighting Ratios and Corrective Techniques. All subjects are generously illustrated with drawings and beautiful photographs. Whether you are new to bridal photography or are an experienced pro, this book has something of interest for you."
5,great shielding on these cables,"very nice set of component cables - nice and solid connections on the heads - great shielding and good gauge wiring... decent price for the length, too. Its sad that the idiocy of bob Mulligan and his irrelevant 1 star rating will prevent these cables from getting the 5 star they deserve."
4,Living with courage and faith,"I think that the Kim's story is fantastic. She truly is living with faith, not only in Christ but in people. She has allowed herself to move forward and use her position in life to help better other's lives as well. I was only a toddler when she was photographed, however, I remember seeing the photo all of my life. I can truly respect her and her struggle to become the woman she is today. I now have someone else to look up to. Thank you to D.Chong for allowing a strong woman's story to be heard."
4,Great History lesson!,"As a person from the sixties when Viet Nam, and you had a draft card in your wallet, this book made me appreciate the great country the U.S. is.."
5,A recommended read.,"This book was recommended to me by a Vietnam Veteran. I am not a regular reader, however I could not put this book down. We have just returned from our first Vietnam holiday so names of places fell into place. Breaker Cusack also recommended ""When Heaven and Earth changed places."" If it is anything like ""The Girl in the picture"" I cant wait to purchase a copy.Great read"
4,Havohej is the most raw and nihilistic music ever,"Havohej is known more for the a cappella gravel-throat blasphemy that closes this album than the triad of nihilistic model metal that opens it, but the musical contributions of this primitive and violent music must not be overlooked. It breaks metal down to modal structures shifting between tone centers along the fretboard, creating harmony from similarity and melody from proximity. This nihilism makes for stunningly basic and deconstructive music, which is their aim as artists and political thinkers: to tear down the centralized structure of human control."
4,Good toy but quits working with normal use,"I bought this for my now 2 year old daughter. Both the 2 year old and her sister love it.The only problem is that within a week of frequent use, the sensor and motor stopped working. The software seems to work fine, but the book no longer scrolls at all and it's basically stuck on page 1. I purchased another cartridge (the Elmo one), which they liked a lot too and it doesn't work in the toy either. I read that a few other people have had this problem. Now we're stuck with a toy that doesn't work. I should have heeded the reviews and found another toy. It's a shame that there are some bugs with this toy, I really like it and the idea behind it. My older daughter was singing the songs by day 2. By day 7, it quit."
3,Major Disappointment,My son received this on Christmas and three days later the microphone already stopped working. My son was very upset. He loved singing along. I would not recommend this toy to anyone until Fisher Price fixes the flaws. I usually love Fisher Price but this toy really let me and my son down!
4,Wish we could find the Barney cartridge!,"We have been unable to find the Barney cartride for this toy any where (Barney is my 2 year old's favorite). The toy itself is loud, but very educational. I have had to return the toy once for a new one because it got stuck. There seemed to be a short in it or something (would work and then stop working which was frustrating to my daughter). She does not seem patient with it (just keeps pushing the arrow button to see the screen move instead of participating, however, she will not be 2 until next month)."
2,"Helpful, but poor explanations","The book is definitely helpful in understanding how Jython works, but the explanations should be made in a much more user-friendly way with more examples. Often I found myself left in the fog. The book sometimes assumes things without explaining. For instance, for simple functions like the following (p. 113):>> import jarray>> jarray.array(['crystal', 'ball'],java.lang.String)you need to import java.lang.String before calling it. I didn't know that but the book doesn't explain that.Also the book doesn't make clear that to import some java classes you have to include .jar file in the sys.path. It does mention .jar files but should make clear and emphasize that you must include it as a necessary step and also show how to do that. It took me a lot of agonizing and asking around to finally figure these out."
1,CARON PARFUM,"THE PRODUCT WAS PRETTY CHEAP FOR THIS KIND OF PRODUCT, BUT ALSO WAS OLD AND HAD LOST NEARLY ALL FOR HIS FRAGANCE. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FURTHER RESALE"
2,a little dissapointed,"My father has been wearing pour un homme for years and was very excited when I told him Amazon carried this product. While the cologne arrived authentically packaged, it's scent was extremely weak compared to what it normally smells like. I suspect this bottle was a little on the old side and that is why it's potency was questionnable."
3,sarong,"The sarong came in a timely manner, but the fabric had a dried substance in several areas that didn't come off with a washing. I eventually rubbed it off and it's fine, but it was disappointing not to be able to use it right away."
2,packaging mismatch,"I agree with the other reviewers regarding the less than ideal elements in this instructional material.I find it more than frustrating to discover the product I just purchased, with this beautiful, elegant, graceful dancing couple on the outside box is not what it seems!The actual dancer/teachers present a stark contrast to the image on the media package cover. Check it out from the library first, prior to buying...see for yourself!This is yet another dust collector on my dance media shelf!"
2,No Two- Step,"Even though on screen it reads social two step, if you listen you will hear them say Foxtrot and the video practice is the same as the foxtrot. So there is an editing error. The foxtrot was repeated in place of the two step. They should fix this error before you pay a high price for this DVD. The steps were slow enough to follow for the absolute beginner, but the counting at times did not match the foot movement. So you were already moving your foot onto step 3 while they were counting aloud step 2. I would have to say my own counting aloud above theirs to make sense. It still works to do that, but it slows down your learning. If you are lost in dance class, this DVD may help with practice at home."
1,Poor instruction,"The instruction offered was lousy. The waltz is incomprehensible, it bears no resemblance to the way the dance is supposed to look. I highly recommend ""Learn to Dance in Minutes: Party Dancing"" By: Cal Pozo for the ballroom beginner (like me.) Play it along with a CD of appropriate music."
5,Great to learn the basics!,My wife and I are enjoying the dvd's of ballroom dancing very much. It is a great way to learn. Quickly you are able to dance with basic steps. The only drawback was the lack of music to practice the steps after the instruction. Not a problem if you have a computer and can quickly download a few. Which we did. Enjoy!
3,Room,"They video is very helpful. However, you need more space then the normal living room. I am always bumping into something and have to cut the run short."
4,Good for college beginners,"I've started taking German as a freshman in college with this textbook. I think it's well worth it...but I would say that it is only suitable in a classroom setting. It emphasizes conversation, has helpful vocab lists, and moves at a good pace. The accompanying exercise book is a must, as are the oral exercises. Overall, a good choice for a college-level beginner! Tschuess!"
3,Spasilk Bodysuit review,"These onesies are very soft and thicker than other brands- perfect for winter layering. But, the material stretches with each machine wash and the neckline is now too large to adequately cover baby's collar bone area."
1,Faulty Snaps,The snaps on all three of the onesies that we received do no stay snapped. A onesie is not very useful with defective snaps. Quality control appears to be lacking on this product. I would advise for others to look into other brands.
2,"soft, but not a great fit","I love how soft the fabric is on these onesies. But, I won't be buying them again for a few reasons: 1. the neck is really wide so the onesie doesn't cover the upper chest and neck area very well 2. the shoulder flaps never lay flat 3. they run pretty small"
5,Great Shower gift and basic essential!,These bodysuits are so soft and comfortable. My daughter is 8 1/2 months and just starting to crawl and pull herself up. These bodysuits are perfect because they allow her to move freely and stretch to pull herself up. I use them alone when she is home playing and under her outfit when going out. These bodysuits make the perfect SHOWER GIFT and they feel so soft. This is on my list for the next baby shower gift and a great basket filler if you are into making gift baskets. We truely enjoy this product.
3,"Good, but not great","I like these bodysuits, but for me they weren't worthy of five starts. The did shrink a bit more than I thought they would, and the neck/shoulder area is a little loose for me. It doesn't tend to stay flat. Otherwise, they are perfectly serviceable and the fabric is soft. I don't regret buying them but will probably stick with Carter's brand in the future."
3,"Good quality, sizing didn't work for us",Very soft onesies. I bought the 9 month size for my pudgy 4-month old thinking that it would be roomy now with some space for growth. Didn't really work out and after washing and drying the onesie is just the right size for her now in terms of length and width. I also feel that the neck opening is a bit large and doesn't provide as much under-the-neck (drool zone) coverage as I'd like. I think I'll stick with Carters which are much longer in the body but of poorer fabric.
1,Useless snaps,The shape was fine for my wide baby but the snaps would not stay snapped making these useless for me to use.
1,"Short, wide fit","Unlike other reviewers say, I found these onesies to be a terrible fit. They are short and wide. I bought the 12 month size for my average-to-short 11 month old and they were a tight fit length-wise. They are so wide, however, they they fall off my baby's shoulders. I'm going back to Carters."
1,Horrible fit,"Probly the worst set of ""bodysuits"" that Ive bought so far. Horrible fit, they stretch, and dont wash well. Just spend the extra money and get Carters"
3,"It's OK. The necks are really huge, and the body is short.","Maybe my baby is weird shaped, but the fit of these onesies is not as good as some other brands we've tried."
1,Huge around the neck,"I bought these in a 24 month size. They seem like they are made for a disproportionate kid who is very round and very short. And, to top it off the neck is so wide it will barely stay on my child's shoulders. I don't use them unless I'm in a pinch with no other clean ones."
3,"Material is good, but width it too big.","The material was soft and made of quality fabric.The bodysuit itself is wider than normal bodysuits and the neck is very wide and does not stay on my daughters shoulders.I originally bought this as a bottom layer to keep her warm in the winter months, but it's too loose and it's hard to adjust the neck so it stays on my daughters shoulder, especially when another shirt is put over it.The quality is great, but the size does not work for me."
5,What I wanted in a onesie,"The product was sized correctly, much larger than the Gerber brand of the same size, and the cotton is thick."
1,Very Poor Fit,"These bodysuits fit terribly around the neck! The neck opening is HUGE (my husband likens it to the ""bacon neck"" depicted in Hanes commercials). Worst fit I have seen in a onesie / bodysuit yet. Returned them immediately."
2,Smells like chemicals,"I've washed these more times than I can remember, soaked them in vinegar for days (literally), then rewashed them. They still have a chemical smell. I'm not sure what's going on. I had previously purchased some long-sleeve body suites from the same company, which didn't have this smell. I do not like putting something on my baby that smells so strongly of the chemicals used to process the fabric. If I cannot get the smell out, I'll have to donate them to Goodwill and hope that their laundering is more effective than mine. Other than the smell, the quality of the fabric seems good."
3,Not for long bodies,"Nice fabric, very soft. My daughter is very long, so getting them to snap closed became an issue very quickly. I could have bought the 12 month and I think I would have been fine."
5,SpaSilk Sells Itself.,"This is the only brand onsies I will buy for my grandchildren.They are thicker, softer, larger and hold their shape."
3,"Nice feel and thickness, shrunk in wash.",This was my first experience with this brand. Before washing I was very pleased with the texture/softness and weight of these onsies. However after washing they shrunk a considerable amount the long way. They still appear wide enough but will now require the onsie extenders to fit. The price is reasonable but I wish I went with Gerber or Carters.
4,White T-Shirt Look ... But Has Tag,"These onesies are good quality, short-sleeve and thick material. They have very long tags at the back of the neck. They're soft/not scratchy, but I probably would have been turned off by that if buying in a store. Otherwise I like them a lot and the 9 month size fits my long-torsoed 5 month old just fine."
2,Sized very funny,"I read many reviews and did my research before I purchased these. I read that the sizing was a little off, so I ordered a size larger. My daughter only weights 19 pounds and usually wears a 12 month onsie. I purchased these 18 month size. They barely fit. They are WAY too short. They barely fit her now, but they definately wont fit her when she is 13 months old."
3,Not that great,"As others mentioned, the neck is unnecessarily large (and my son has a 95th percentile head). Also, these run a bit small. I bought the 12 month for my son, which I assumed was 12-18 month, but it fits more like most of his 9-12 month clothing. He is 20 lb, 30 inches and they are too small (just barely, but still definitely too small). The width is fine but the length is not enough. Also, I just didn't think they were that soft. The softest onesies I've found have been at H&M, oddly enough, possibly because they're made from organic cotton."
3,decent onezies,"These onezies are made of nice cotton (thicker and softer than usual). They are a little wider (around the trunk) than the ones from Old Navy. The opening around the neck is a bit wide and when you put the baby's head through it, the fabric folds that form the opening (on the shoulders) do not close up nicely. They tend to bunch up. The snaps are better than on the cheaper Gerber onezies, but not as nice as the Old Navy ones. Overall these onezies are better than the ones from Gerber but not as great as the Old Navy ones."
5,True to size,these are a lot nicer than gerber ones. They are a lot thicker and are true to size. Perfect for outfits i needed undershirts for. came fast
2,Way too short,"My 4 month old is 90% in height, he can't fit into the 12 month size with this brand, which is much shorter and wider than other brands. Very disappointed as i can't return these since they were washed already not knowing they wouldn't fit."
2,"Odd shade of white, odd shape, poor fit","Sure these are soft, but most cotton is. The neck is huge, and the shoulders do not sit well on my son's shoulders. He looks like a baby linebacker when he wears it. Also, the white is an odd shade. It almost has a blue undertone to it, and does not match the other white items in his wardrobe."
3,Focus is not on the bombers,"I was a little disappointed with this video. I was hoping for a video that focused on the bombers themselves, you know, film of the interior, specifications, model upgrades, first hand accounts and so on. Instead, this video deals with German bomber strategy, air war history, Goering, etc. For example, the first part of the video goes into great detail about the destruction of Guernica by the Germans during the Spanish Civil War: the number of civilians killed, how they were strafed and bombed from the air, the destruction of their town, etc. Interesting, but not focused on German bombers!An OK video, but not quite what I was expecting."
2,Was this just an ad?,"I'm not sure what the purpose of the book was apart to say that Amano is good. The pictures are nice, but there are lots of nice pictures available for free."
1,The worst Amano book printed by TFH,"I found this book to be one of the worst books that TFH has put out by Takashi Amano. Instead of translating one of Amano's books from Japanese they decided instead to translate Amano's 1995 publication that was first published in German into English. If you are looking for current up-to-date advice on Aqua Design Amano tips and trick look elsewhere. Almost all the techniques used in this book are old, and some inaccurate. This is a TFH book not an Aqua Design Amano Publication.It would have been better if TFH had translated The Nature Aquarium / ADA Concepts from Japanese to English. This book is the most current when it comes to product use, tips, tricks, and overall care for aquatic plants. If you are looking for advice on setting up a planted tank or plant ID don't buy Aquarium Plant Paradise."
2,very sloppy,Just got this book and noticed that a lot of the information is inaccurate. It seems the pictures of the aquariums and the list of plants in the aquariums do not always match up. It's like they just started naming random plants for each picture.
3,Colour selection,This is by far the worst book i do own on Amano's wonderful tanks. Pictures are poorly printed and the overall impression is deceptive.
2,"Great photos, poor information","I was vary disapoited with this book. It lacked information, jumped around with subjects, and focused more on aesthetic reasons and left out many of the ""basics"" of aqutic gardining, such as plant profiles, nutriant levels, and CO2 tips. It's more like a picture book than a guide book."
4,I Don't speak German,"I don't speak German, so this CD was pretty much a mystery to me. I guess it's some sort of comedy record. I still gave it some stars because I like listening to foreign languages, even if I don't understand them. Which I don't."
1,Strong scoop.,"I have a red one. It is very strong, but I consider it a failure. The shiny finish is flaking off. It's not just on the scooping part, but even back on the handle! Does anyone make a good scoop that won't flake?"
3,"Not bad, not great","After reading the reviews, I figured I could tolerate the pink. Got it and the handle was loose right out of the package. It hasn't fallen off, but not very good quality."
4,Please just not pink!,"My father loved this scoop when he used it at a friend's house. I wanted to get it for him, but not in pink! Please how about basic black...Its a five star scoop, but just not in its current blushing shade."
3,Beginner TKD,This instructional DVD was a nice addition to my martial arts collection. It is meant for the person who has no previous experience. I would buy it on sale or discount.
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY STREET MARTIAL ARTS SELF DEFENSE,THIS VIDEO IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE I EXPECTED KILLER COOL MOVES THAT WERE EASY TO DO. I'AM NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU THE MOVES ON THERE ARE GOOD IF YOU ARE TAKING A TAEKWONDO CLASS AND HAVE EXPERINCE. THE GUY THAT EXPLAINS THE MOVES IS HARD TO UNDER STAND UNLESS YOUR A REAL STUDENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE MOVE IS WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY STREET SELF DEFENSE VIDEOS. BYE AND WACH OUT IF THIS IS REALLY THE MOVE FOR YOUPS THE MOVIE TAKES PLACE IN A ROSE GARDEN AND A MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL. THIS IS ALL THE TRUTH NO LIE NEVER WILL I LIE TO YOU PEACE
3,Decent for Beginners,"This Instructional Taekwondo DVD is fairly basic. It lays out just the simple moves that you can learn as a beginner. It's drawback is that it doesn't give you much of a step-by-step guide. You're pretty much left to figure out how to do it yourself and while most of the moves are easy enough, there are some that require repeated rewinding and pausing to be able to get it down just right.Still, if you're looking for something to help you start, this is a pretty decent DVD."
3,"Good Information, but not much to practice with","Good information about Tae Kwon Do, but we would have liked more forms and moves in a practice format. You can watch them perform the moves, but they don't give you a view from your perspective that you can practice with. For example, it would have been nice to stand behind them and do the moves along with them."
2,Don't Get This if You are In a Class,"This is an extremely weak 26 minute video that gives you an incredibly light overview on the basics. If you have paid for classes, you will get all of this content in the first few weeks of class. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Great Go to Guide,"I really wish I had read this when I was..oh say 16, but I'm 22 and just read it last month. It's a great book that has helpful simple explainations of how to start off as an actor/actress. Peter is quick and to the point in breaking everything down and gives helpful tips that seem to come from a long history of being in the business. As an aspiring actress this was a great place to start!"
5,Finally something really helpful!,"Finally I found an acting book with more than 1 or 2 good chapters. I've been getting Pete's newsletter for a while so it does't surprise me that the book is so useful, but wow, it's really a lot of good stuff.What I didn't expect was all the encouragement. I like that he doesn't belittle people by saying that you have to do this or have to do that. Even though he gives a ton of ""real"" information in his steps, he never stops saying ""It's up to you to go do it."" It's so encouraging. I think it would help anyone achieve any kind of career or business goal. Not just acting. It's that good."
3,"Good, not great!",National Geo does a mediocre presentation. Could have been deeper with more presentations of the current precision ceremonies.Too much more background left too little time for the splendor of the actual honor guard!
2,Used item.,My package contains an used/open box item with water stains on it.I sent it right back.It requires an additional valve that cost a lot. So please consider the cost of the whole set when you make the purchase.
1,Waste of money!!!!,"I bought this to help my milk to let down after having my son. As with all my other Evenflo breastpumps that have broken (you'd think I'd have learned after 3 others broke-electric and manual) this one stopped suctioning within the first week. Don't waste your money. It's tempting, but spend it elsewhere."
1,disappointed,I got this mannual pump thinking I could use it while I was out and about. I never got hte thing to work! I tried multiple times and thought it was just me till i check out the other reviews here. Don't waste your time on this pump.
1,I'm with all the rest of the reviews...,"I couldn't even get an ounce out of it. I tried for 45 min and I got a few drops. This product is a wast of time, money, and patients. This time I will get an electric one. They should pull this item from the shelf."
2,This pump is a pain!,This is what happens when you send DH to shop for a pump. I told him exactly the one I wanted and this is what he came back with. I have heard several bad reviews about evenflo's pumps and with this pump I can see why. My first few times trying to pump with this thing I struggled to even cover the bottom of the bottle. I felt that the suction was very weak and the handle on the pump is just plain horrible? I spent over 20mins on the phone waiting for customer service and they basically told me no returns or refunds. So I try and try again and finally after several practices I can pump about 4oz in 30mins. Not to mention if the bottle or valve is a little wet... then it wont drop anything down into the bottle. I would just recommend staying far away from this product. Its not worth the money at all.
2,Don't get enough milk,"I'm not able to get enough milk with this pump. The most I've ever gotten is 3 oz (usually I struggle for one or two ounces), and I know my milk supply is fine. I've used this pump at least 20 times, now I'm going to buy a diffrernt pump to see if I have better luck. Also, I find the pumping action to be awkward and makes my arm sore after awhile."
3,this book is:,this isnt the best versoin of cinderella i've heard!but it is all i could find for a school projectif there was any good pictures from the book that i could have down loaded it would get 5 stars
4,RONCH AT HIS BEST,"7th studio album from 1995. Canada's outfit Fist lead by frontman Ron Chenier who also released ""Round One"", ""Hot Spikes"", ""Thunder In Rock"", ""In The Red"", ""Danger Zone"", ""Reign Of Terror"". Powerful vocals and a well produced album..."
3,"Intelligent author, obtuse work","What I remember about this book (from many years ago) is that Joad thought Dylan Thomas' ""Refusal to Mourn the Death by Fire of a Child in London"" was ""decadent"" because incomprehensible. Though Thomas wrote a lot of obscure (and to my mind unreadable) poetry, the poem Joad chose to attack is one of Thomas' least obscure. Joad's not to be relied upon as a critic of poetry (""decadent"" or not)."
4,Exceptional War Movie,"I've seen this movie many years ago and it rates up there with movies like ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" and ""Green Baret"" just to name a few. If your a war movie buff-It's a MUST see movie. Hopefully, it will be released on DVD soon."
3,Hell to Eternity,"This movie has not withstood the test of time, but still offers an insight into one American's experience growing up with Japanese Americans and then using his LA Japanese to face Imperial Japanese forces on Saipan. This DVD could be made much more effectively if it had film of the real Guy Gabaldon, who died recently. Of course, that would ruin the fantasy-story Hollywood created around him. A simple man, who fought an enemy, tried to talk them into surrendering, but shot them dead if they did not. Not much romance in that, but, it was war."
2,Not that good,"I love old wwii movies. The cheesier the better. I was delited that I found another one that I hadn't already watched. What a disappointment. The story line drifts all over the place. The ending is contrived and rushed. Don't waste your time, this movie is no classic."
3,"Good movie, based on a Great Marine!","However, I felt that the story dragged a little, and some of the actual facts concerning the Corp were overlooked, assuming to please liberal Hollywood directors. *Want more, then read the many stories posted at Camp Lejune, NC with the many other Marines who have served and continue to serve God and Country daily. Semper Fi, and thank you, Marines!"
3,Good War Classic,I really liked this movie and it's story line. Jeffery Hunter was casted good in this movie. I will enjoy going back and watching this again from time to time.
2,Good story poorly told,"The story about Guy Gabaldon is really an interesting one, its too bad they couldn't find a more compelling way to portray it. The casting, script and direction are all very weak and not at all engaging.In what should have been a compelling story about a very unusual story from WW2, a white man who was raised by a Japanese family before the war ends up fighting in the Pacific war while his adopted family is in an internment camp in the US is basically a throw away.I think that you could find our more about this by just going on line"
1,X-Files in book form,"Before I read this, I was mildly parannoid about the reality of government mind control experiments and the possibility of UN manipulation of the US government. Reading this has changed my opinion entirely. The author relates these things to UFO's and cow mutilations. The content of this book effectively convinced me that the things I was formerly paranoid about are just dillusions cooked up by borderline pshycotic militia-men."
1,"Worthless, Low-Brow","This book was nothing more than BS renforcing what the nuts who read it think. The facts don't make any sense and the writing is mediocire at best. If you want real information on what the government is doing to our lives, go for something a litte more highbrow. If you are one of the aforementioned nuts, read tabloids or write your own book."
4,Outstanding Book,"So far what I have read is outstanding, I am gald I went ahead, and got both Books by Jim Kelth. Thank you"
4,Hilarious!,"Even if you didn't see Shaun of the DeadShaun of the Dead, check out this movie. It is definitely worth a watch for all the laughs and Brit humor. Some gore and blood, but since it's a comedy, you may find yourself laughing at the death scenes or at the most saying ""ouch"". If you're a Timothy Dalton fan, check this movie out for his creepy, somewhat swarmy character."
3,"Average Story, Not Too Funny","Hot Fuzz has won a lot of critical acclaim. It is not the sort of film you would dislike. Simon Pegg is absolutely great as a police officer who's been transferred to a small town in England from London. He is a thorough professional and takes his job a tad too seriously but he's stuck in a peace loving place like Sandford. At Sandford (small town) , he manages to find a few clues here and there as to murders which are made to look like accidents. The film is really fast because there are many one second shots and the movie dictates it's own pace. It is a good watch for almost all kinds of viewers. However, I felt the film was a tad too self indulgent in terms of it's comical structure. There are no overtly funny scenes because the storyline doesn't leave much room for humor. Humor is however squeezed out, almost cheesy sometimes. This is not a bad film, just isn't a standout either. One might disagree but ""Death Proof"" is my film of the year. Watch that."
3,Lukewarm Follow-up to Shaun of the Dead,"After the critical and commercial success of Shaun of the Dead, it looks as if Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg were given the freedom to do anything they wanted.Too much freedom, it seems. I often found myself wondering what kind of movie Hot Fuzz wanted to be and I am not sure Wright and Pegg knew themselves. Even the most talented writers and directors need some critical feedback while practicing their craft. It just appears they didn't get it.Hot Fuzz throws in nearly plot and storyline imaginable in a two hour film that could have easily been cut by 30 minutes. The Scream-like killer becomes a very odd detour that drains comedy out of the movie and the predictable plot twists never transform into the genre bending genius of Shaun of the Dead.They just remain predictable plot twists in a rather lukewarm effort."
3,Mixed Feelings....,"This is one of those movies that starts out great, in fact, the first hour & 25 minutes are fabulous & very witty!!Then this movie goes down hill and fast, as the last 30 minutes were the cheesiest and most unbelievable ever! The last 30 minutes of this movie totally ruined this movie for me. It just didn't jive with how the main character would act or the rest of the movie in general."
3,meesh,This is one of those movies where the only good parts were what was shown in the trailer!the trailer showed awesome actiona and witty humor but the movie ended up being some weird comical thriller that was ok.if it werent for the ending i would have given this 1 start but the ending saved it with its great action and turnaround.it was ok
3,no shaun of the dead,"while it was funny and action packed, it took a couple of tries to not fall asleep through it. While it is slow out of the gate, it finishes like the 2005 rose bowl. The extra features are ok, if youre into outtakes and what not."
3,Sooooo Slooooow,"From reviews and the trailer, I expected an English comedy. While there are some funny parts, this moves sooo slooow, I just kept hoping it would pick up speed, and it didn't happen till the end. The only way this could be in the running for funniest comedy of the year is if there weren't any others."
4,Hot Fuzz,A very enjoyable fast paced film. Lots of action and violence but humorous at the same time. I loved the dialogue and all of the characters.
3,"The gore worked for Shaun, but is misplaced in this.","Yes, this film is highly entertaining. But there was really no need to turn it into a gore-fest. Shaun was a zombie flick, and it was expected. But even the most violent cop flicks aren't usually this messy."
2,I just didn't think it was that funny.,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is fricking HILARIOUS, but ""Hot Fuzz"" is mildly amusing at best.After a promising start, say the first 20 mins or so, the film drags on for another hour eliciting few chuckles. The ending (last 1/2 hr)--though funnier-also drags.NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,A Disappointment,"After thoroughly enjoying Shaun of the Dead and reading the praising reviews for Hot Fuzz I expected a funny, entertaining film. This comedic story concept could have worked but it seemed like the writer(s) settled on the first half-baked concept they thought of at every story line turn. Especially the goofy, head-scratching ending. My one-word review for this film: Moronic."
1,"Great movie, crap quality disc","Sat down to watch my new DVD of Hot Fuzz and lo and behold, it only plays about two-thirds of the way through before seizing up. I tried playing it in three different devices. No dice. Crap quality."
3,not worth buying,"I couldn't wait to see this movie, I was very dissapointed. Shaun of the dead is a very funny movie and I was looking forward to the same in this one. On a scale of 1-10 shaun of dead is an 8 Hot fuzz a 2, I won't be watching it again."
2,Starts good then gets annoying,I don't understand the hype. The movie is average and its special effects are very annoying. I actually went out of the movies after an hour.
2,It becomes what it spoofs,"I had high hopes for this one given the glowing reviews everywhere for it, but it suffers from the same problem as Club Dread: it became the very thing it was spoofing. The first half or so of this movie is great. It's hilarious and spoofs so many police and action movies and TV shows that it's a good test for a movie nerd. But when its own story began to take the lead, the gruesome death scenes and tired shootouts, while not without comic nods, were virtually indistinguishable from what the first half lampooned. It devolved so much, my wife and I turned it off with 10 minutes left."
4,FANTASTIC,"If you would like to see a fusion of Britcom with an american action flic, then this is for you!!!"
4,WARNING U MUST HAVE A MOVIE I.Q TO REALLY ENJOY THIS,"this film is pretty damn funny, most people will not understand this film because they dont have a movie IQ. a great comedy to watch if IF your not dumb. the reason i say this is because there are alot of people who don't understand what a spoof is ( u know why you are) and so they overlook it.but if u cant understand this then dont bother."
5,My Favorite Comedy. Period.,"Most people prefer Shaun of the Dead to Hot Fuzz, but in my opinion, this movie is just overall funnier in the end. Maybe it's because I've seen more action movies than zombie movies. But, regardless, this really is my favorite comedy, nothing else really comes quite close. When I saw it in theaters, it was me and one friend, and we pretty much didn't stop laughing the entire time. If you don't like British humor, you'll still probably find some parts of it you enjoy, but if you do, it's really just non stop fantastic. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do and always will make an incredible comedic pair, and I really highly recommend this movie to most anyone."
2,not that funny,"I actually live in the UK and like a lot of British films, but I just did not find this film that funny. I got the jokes, they just weren't great. The film is an action/comedy, but the unique blend just didn't work for me. The action wasn't great action and the comedy (mostly) wasn't great comedy.I do like the general story idea (of a small, traditional, moral town being exposed as evil to the core), but the way it was told just didn't click for me."
2,Very disappointed.,"Just because you like Simon Pegg doesn't mean you will like this movie. I was very disappointed by this movie having enjoyed Shaun of the Dead. But in Hot Fuzz, the laughs were limited and overall it seemed like they were trying to ride the coattails of ""Shaun of the Dead"". I would pass on this for a purchase."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With none of the wit and sharpness that characterized Shaun of the Dead, to say nothing of that film's hilarity, Hot Fuzz is a slow and plodding comedy that somehow lasts for over two hours despite its flimsy plot and lack of enjoyable character interaction--what a disappointment."
2,Boring as Fuzz,"Yes, I understand this movie is supposed to spoof action films but it is not that funny. The pacing is very slow. I kind of felt like the movie was just a build up for one big joke. The first 3/4 of the film was very mundane, and then last part of the film did a 180 degree turn around and become over-the-top ridiculous. I believe that was supposed to be the big joke. Personally, my favorite action spoof is Trey Parker's and Matt Stone's Team America. I suggest that movie instead of this one."
3,"OK, but takes itself too seriously...","I loved Shaun of the Dead, seeing it in the theater and owning it on DVD. My only complaint would be that it starts off great but finishes by taking itself way too seriously.Hot Fuzz has the opposite problem... it starts off taking itself way too seriously and doesn't get wonderfully funny until the final third of the movie.The setup is excruciating, but the payoff is pretty funny. Assuming you have the patience to get there."
3,Over hyped,"With all the hype for this movie I was expecting more. Half the time I could not understand the British accents, and the movie itself was just OK."
5,Brit-alicious,"I hope these folks continue to make more movies together. The results are a guaranteed laugh-out-loud experience. Not for all tastes, but for those who enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, you will definitely enjoy this film."
5,Fun Movie,"I enjoyed this film.""Hot Fuzz"" on HD DVD has great picture and excellent sound quality.Plenty of great humour...awesome action...very much a captivating work!This film is quite funny, and I highly recommend seeing it!"
4,Hot Fuzz is Hot!,"Hot Fuzz is very funny, with some excellent action scenes. Simon Pegg is just hilarious, and he has a great chemistry with the other actors, especially Nick Frost. The English humor - or should I say humour - is fast and furious in this movie. The Sleepy Hollow of a town and its excellent scenery are an unusual location for the fast moving criminal activity that follows. Not for kids with its R rating, there is plenty of violence and off color jokes. A 4-star thrill ride with laugh after laugh. Enjoy!"
4,Fun Movie,"This was a very interesting movie. A coworker recommended this movie to me and I was not disappointed. It has Drama, Intrigue, and Comedy all rolled into one. At the end it seemed a little long, not because it was boring, but because we were so drawn into it that we didn't notice that 2 hours had passed. Get your snacks lined up before you sit down to watch this one."
4,hysterically graphic,"hot shot london police officer angel is getting a promotion;police sargeant.......in the sticks.turns out that his excellence is making a mockery of the force.he begrudgingly accepts his new assignment with the same vigor that got him that assignment.1st day on and he ends up arresting half the town and a fellow officer (unbeknownest).as agel becomes more adjusted to the normalcy,''accidents'' begin to mount.seems that the quaint little countryside retirement village that wins best town awards is anything but.theres something amiss and its killing off residents in gruesome fashion.this is a movie which i hope turns into a franchise."
4,Funny Movie!!,"This movie starts off a little slow, like half way through actually. But the second half is completely action packed and hilarious! I recommend this movie to everyone."
2,over-rated,"I watched Hot Fuzz on the strength of 'Shaun of the Dead', which was a marvellous breath of fresh air from Hollywoods bloated excesses. HF has a great cast. One of my favourite British actors from any era Jim Broadbent. Simon Pegg who has an intensity in his acting that is very funny. Bill Bailey, Nick Frost, Timothy Dalton etc etc, but somehow it just doesn't work.The idea behind the story has the makings of a successful comedy. Sgt Angel is sent to Sandford, a small sleepy English town, because he is too good. As Angel Simon Pegg is perfect for the role but is let down most of the time by lines that just aren't that funny. To be honest after an hour had passed I had started to lose interest and at an hour and a half I gave up. It is too long.Maybe on a 2nd showing I will enjoy it more, but its not a film I'd recommend anybody buying just because they liked 'Shaun of the Dead'. rent it first."
4,Homage to American Action,"Great British take on American action films from the great minds that brought us Sean of the Dead. Every cliche is brought into this smart, fast-paced film, but the juxtaposition of the small English town setting just makes it even more ridiculous and fantastic. Laughs and yells from beginning to end. Enjoy!"
4,Hot Fuzz,"Fresh from making the classic Zombie comedyShaun of the Dead [Blu-ray] Pegg and Frost presumably had offers of significant funds to make a more mainstream comedy (after all, Zombies are not exactly family viewing). The result is Hot Fuzz which in spite of its broader market retains the trademark Pegg and Forst comedic appeal.Mixing off-beat comedy with elements of spoof Hot Fuzz mixes Hollywood with rural England to excellent effect. Recommended."
4,One of the funniest police parodies I have ever seen...,"Work hard, but not too hard. If you show your co-workers up, you could end up eliminated--either transferred or fired. That's what PC Nicholas Angel found out. When he got 9 Commendations in one year, the London officials promoted him and sent him to a model village, Sandford, where there hadn't been a murder in years.Angel quickly discovered Sandford was too good to be true. His predecessor probably found out the same thing--but he went loony. Angel, with the help of his cop-movie loving partner, Danny, decides to clean up the town instead.I laughed so hard at points my sides hurt, but there were also a couple of places where I felt a little ill. ""Hot Fuzz"" poked fun at just about every US police film notion. The puns flew and sometimes so did the blood and gore.What _wasn't_ funny was how possible murder could be passed off as an accident in a small town. It's been 4 hours and I'm still shaking."
1,OVER RATED,Loved Shaun of the dead but this movie was boring. I hate the way it was cut too. Gave me an headache.
3,Few laughs,"I couldnt wait to see this movie. I bought it and watched it right away. I was expecting some great things considering these guys made Shaun of the Dead. The first half hour flew by and I was bored. No real laughs just a typical movie. When he movies to the new town, there are a few laughs scattered thru out by it was disappointed. I love horror movies and I was surprised at how gory this movie was. It kind of reminded me of Broken Lizards. They released an amazing film, Super Troopers, then followed it up with a horror comedy that was bad, Club Dread. While these men did make a horror comedy that is probably one of the best ive ever see, this was suppose to be an action comedy. The ending of the movie was pretty sweet though."
3,Disappointing,"After loving Shaun of the Dead so much, I had high hopes for Hot Fuzz, and was let down. It wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it would be, and kind of lost direction at times. Alright, but not a must."
2,HUMOR GONE AWRY,"This movie started with great promise and ended with considerable disappointment. I thought I was in for a bout of dry British humor and satire. But the plot got wilder and wilder, weirder and weirder and less and less funny. It ended in total unreality with a welter of comic-book violence. It was also way too long. Someone should have told the director that sometimes less is more."
3,Brit answer to 'bad boys',"Overall, quite a fun movie. Starts off joyously, gets a bit slow, then really picks up. Much humor and silliness. This was quite fun."
2,Give me a break,"Seriously, the hype over this film on DVD is unreal. I was not that impressed with the previews but I decided to check it out anyways. I usually laugh pretty much at everything and anything and I thought maybe the comical approach this film had would be to my liking.Other than a few funny general spoof plays on London police procedure, this thing is a waste of time. I just did not see any value to it whatsoever. Am I being a stick in the mud? Perhaps I missed something, but considering I have loved films that range from comical to crime drama, this one is at the bottom. What it does is TRY to be funny, and nothing could be more revolting."
5,"definately one of, if not the most quality movie i've seen in a theater","honestly, my expectations of hot fuzz were low upon seeing that it was a cop oriented movie from the commercials, but then again, i forgot that it was simon pegg and nick baker behind it for a second. the movie blew me away to say the least.first, we get introduced to nicholas angel who is this ""take no BS cop."" when he gets assigned to a countryside village, the fun starts to happen..i would compare the movie to even a little Dario Argento mystery mixed with the original Wicker Man....im not going to try to spoil it at all, but this movie should be a riot...i personally would say it is as good as Shaun of the Dead..i dont think i should be comparing to Shaun personally, but yeah...it was also great to see Timothy Dalton again. (Bond Fan)yep, this one is a definate ""add to cart"" when the dvd is available for preorder."
5,Excellent,"The guys from Shaun of the Dead are at it again. This is easily one of my favorite movies. It has the same type of humor as Shaun but this time instead of a zombie attack, they are cops in a small town. Buy this and watch it. You will laugh a ton without a doubt."
4,Nice,A lot of people like this movie.I enjoy that you get both the HD dvd and regular DVD versionsof the movie for one price. Just make sure you have an HD dvd player ifthat's the version that you want to watch.
5,"HOT FUZZ, HOT FUNK, HOTTER THAN HELL","i get lucky when i bought this dvd, because i bought it at very reasonable price, only $7.99. And for that price, i get A LOT of special features. and it is ALL GOOD, hilarious. In terms of packaging, this 3-disc collector's edition comes in shiny black and mirror disc, digipack. This is all what i wanted from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. thx, black friday sale :D"
3,"Funny, but not hysterical by any means","It's definitely not in the ""hysterical"" category. Moments of understated humor throughout, nothing side-splitting; more overt in the second half. The main character spoofs action movie staples and lines. The main plot point, though, the reason for all the killings, when finally revealed, *is* hilarious indeed, one of the funniest concepts ever, almost worth watching the whole movie.Some quite grisly denouements, one or two of which are guaranteed to make you wince. The explosive ending is completely unnecessary. Timothy Dalton is wonderfully greasy."
4,Great fun on blu ray,I already had the regular DVD. But the blu ray's special features made it so much better. I highly recommend this DVD.
2,hot fuzz,I didn't really like this movie very much I thought that it would be funny but instead it was more gory.
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Got this free through a Pepsi promotion. I would not have paid money to get this movie. Not really my kind of comedy, but since it was free, it was fun to watch the first time and I'll likely watch it again down the road sometime. It did have it's funny parts though, and the outtakes were fun to watch."
5,Two gun laughs with extra ammo to spare!,"Ever since ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Spaced"", I've been a fan of Simon Pegg and his crew, but this was a new high. This movie is full of so many laughs that, when my wife and I saw it in the theater, we fell out of our seats often; this is a must see for anyone who loves cop movies and good comedies; you get two-for-one, by the power of GRAYSKULL!"
5,if there were 10 stars...,"This movie is terrific! seriuosly. you want a good laugh, a good mystery and a bit of gore, then this one is for you. I loved ""Shauna of the Dead"" so I was hoping for a good movie... but it is way better then that. FUNNY!"
4,Simon Pegg does it again,"I first saw Simon Pegg in Doctor Who: The Long GameDoctor Who - The Complete First Series, ""The Editor"" was funny and creepy at the same time. That led me toShaun of the Dead. I didn't think Mr. Pegg could top Shaun. He did. Hot Fuzz is every small town that wants to keep their image, it is every buddy movie, it is every action movie. It is even every horror movie. This is how a spoof should be done."
3,Would be Really Funny,"Simon Pegg is one of my favorite comedic afters, and I would love to give this movie 5 stars. However, the ""slasher movie"" aspect of Hot Fuzz was a real turn-off for me. Otherwise, it was hilarious."
5,A great addition to your Movie collection,"This is an excellent movie to add to your collection - Simon Pegg and Nick Frost star in a movie that is hilarious and actually has some great replay value! I purchased this on HD-DVD and the sound quality and the picture were perfect. Their are so many great scenes in this movie to bring up to support why you should buy it, but I'm not going to spoil this for you. If your not sold by my review or all the others, go ahead and rent it because once you do it will be very obvious that its a great movie to add to your collection simply for its replay value."
3,Hot Fuzz,For people who enjoy the Englis type of humor. Was a little hard to getinto the beginning of it. But I think well worth it.
4,avalanche of funny,"this movie starts off kind of slow, but if you keep with it you'll be duly rewarded with its hilarity."
4,Another Classic for the Hot Fuzz duo,I loved Shaun of the Dead and this one is just as good! A definate classic of dry British humour. Have watched it several times now and still not bored of it.
3,A bit of a problem...,"It had some sort of invisible scratches on it that skipped around alot when it reached those areas. So, i had to fix them myself."
1,Why is this movie getting over the top reviews???!,"I am perplexed as to why Hot Fuzz is earning such praise when it is only mildly amusing at best. Some of the funniest jokes in the movie play dead on funny, but the same tired joke being played again and again for more yuks just gets on people's nerves (""so what is it that makes you think this is a murder??!"")The movie reeks of unoriginality from the getgo save for the city supercop transferred to the idyllic countryside, yet even that premise gets weak if it is the only avenue for jokes, as is mostly the case in Hot Fuzz. It's as if the writers had an idea for a short film of 30 minutes and stretched it out another additional hour. I'm sorry for being a naysayer, but even if a movie's main premise is slightly different than the norm, a good film still needs to deliver a whole lot more, and Hot Fuzz simply doesn't. After the near perfect Shaun of the Dead, I am quite disappointed. 1.5 stars"
2,No shaun,Loved shaun of the dead. This one left me cold. Lousy script and halfwitted jokes. Too bad.
1,Big disappointment,"I loved Shaun of the dead as well as the british tv show Spaced that these guys did, so I was looking forward to this movie. I don't know what happened. This movie was not funny at all. I almost never stop watching a film before its over even if it is bad, but this one I didn't care to waste more time watching it in pain waiting for something to redeem it. The reviewers that like this film, I would really like to talk to because I cant understand how someone could enjoy it."
1,"Very, Very Dull","I am a big fan of 'Shaun of the Dead' and was expecting so much more from a reunion of that films stars. Unfortunately, this film is very slow, dull, and , quite frankly, just not very funny at all. I purchased it based on th many rave reviews, but I am convinced that they must have been referring to some other film, perhaps. However, I will be getting this travesty out of my house as soon as possible.A disappointment. Rent it if you must see for yourself, but please don't waste your dollars on this sad effort. Even 1 Star is too many for this film."
1,"great set up, but completely squandered","The first 30 minutes are a great set up, and have several very funny moments. Then the movie becomes absurd, then it just dies, but its undead carcass wastes another 40 minutes of your time.What you think is going to happen is that this by-the-book, overachieving cop--who is sent to the country from London because he embarrasses his more average colleagues--will find himself in the right place at the right time to solve a series of murders in a quiet country town. What actually happens is that the movie dissolves into absurdist, surreal nonsense, and nonsense which is not funny to normal people. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time."
1,Blew chunks,"For as much as I loved Shaun of the DeadShaun of the Dead [HD DVD], I loathed Hot Fuzz. The sound mix was brutal, the story predictable, and the gags recycled. Do watch SoD, skip Hot fuzz."
4,Slow starter...but great finnisher.,"This movie starts off a little slow, I imagin its on perpouse. I great cop gets sent to a quiet town for bing ""too good"" at his job making others look bad. But he soon uncovers that this town has a dark secret, and he must set things straight. I find this movie enjoyable all the way through even if just then ending is where the action is."
5,"""You ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?""","This movie is hilarious in a way that most of the crap that comes out of Hollow wood no longer is. It has a lot to do with the acting. I never saw Shaun of the Dead, but I intend to. If it's half as funny as this was, I'm sure it'll be worth it.The only really disturbing part was the murder in the churchyard. I saw it coming, obviously, but it was shocking how graphic it was."
5,The best version of the best movie of the year,"Yes, there are as many versions of this DVD as there are people in China, but this is by far the best, and yes it is worth every penny, even if you already own it. I'd already had the UK and US HD-DVD version before this product was announced, but the moment I heard ""Extended Fuzzball Rally,"" I knew I had to get this. How extended is it? Let's just say that of the 40 minutes they added to the Fuzzball Rally, a good 80% of it is too taboo for telly. Yeah. It's good. In addition to the extra footage of the US tour, it has everything that the UK DVD had (which is a hell of a lot more than what the standard US DVD had), and an entirely new commentary featuring none other than Quentin Tarantino.Every person who loves this movie must own this edition of the DVD. It is a DVD made by hardcore film fans for hardcore film fans."
5,One of the best HD DVD releases so far,"I was always a big fan of Hot Fuzz, unlike Shaun of the Dead I thought that Hot Fuzz was actually hilarious, it's one of those movies that I could watch over and over and never get sick of it. And I have been watching my DVD copy over and over, so I know the DVD version pretty well. But after watching the HD DVD version all I can say is ""wow"". The jump in quality for HD DVD is amazing, it looks SO much better on high definition. The fight scene in the supermarket looks so vibrant now, you can read all the labels, you can clearly see the splatter of tomato sauce, everything looks phenomenal. The soundtrack is also pretty amazing, in Dolby True HD the music really jumps out at you. It's like watching at the movies all over again.Hot Fuzz on HD DVD is definately the movie I will be showing my friends to show off my HDTV set up and my sound system. HD DVD made one of my favourite movies even better, so I cannot give it anything less than five stars."
5,This s**t just got real!,"I'll keep it brief:This HD-DVD has a fantastic picture. Very, very pristine looking. The sound is really loud and will beat your surround speakers and subwoofer up something awful. Seriously. it rivals the most ridiculous sounding action movie you've seen. A simple scene like a purchase of an ice cream cone sounds almost like a multiple car crash. And the whole movie is like that. But I'm not complaining!And there's more extras here than you'll be able to watch in one sitting. One of the extras is the second flip book drawing that Nick Frost's character shows off to Simon Pegg that we don't get to see in the film. Just that in itself is worth the price of admission!Seriously though, this is (and I'm almost surprised to say it) an HD-DVD more than up to the task of being a demo for your home theater system."
4,Surprisingly entertaining!,"Although my GenY son encouraged me to watch this, I was truly entertained and amused by watching this flick (do people still call these ""flicks""?!)Not only were there deeper messages, about enjoying life and friendship, in addition to work, there was the facade of a *perfect town* blown wide open by a vigilant cop, who fought the system.Further, the ending is one that I was not expecting. To destroy it is not my style, but suffice it to say that the lessons learned were real world and not Hollywood swill. Watch Hot Fuzz-- you probably won't be disappointed!"
4,Its No Shaun of the Dead,"While I really enjoyed Hot Fuzz, it falls well short of Shaun of the Dead. To me, the humor in Hot Fuzz wasn't as funny as the previous film, but the action sure made up for it. This movie also boasts ample gore and a couple of inventive death sequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are funny guys and I hope to see them team up many more times in the future."
4,Hot Fuzz.,"Another Simon Pegg I love! very funny, Hot Fuzz is a different and silly movie that I enjoyed, you should give it a try on netflix or rental :)"
4,A must see,I love these guys. Loved them in Shaun of the Dead. I can't wait to see what they have in store for their next production.
5,I love these guys!,"Did you like ""Shawn of the Dead""? Well you'll love this movie by the same guys. Hilarious British humor."
1,This cable didn't work: caused mis-colored screens and XP lockup,"I purchased this cable to get a little extra distance from my new (awesome) Dell U3100 Monitor. The monitor came with a 6 ft. DVI-D cable but it was too short for my needs. My XP system and video card worked fine with the Dell-supplied cable, but when I connected this one (double-checked the connections), I started getting mis-colored screens, and even a lockup of XP where, after a boot, I'd be stuck with an hourglass forever if I moved the cursor over the taskbar. When I reinstalled the Dell Cable, everything works great again.To be fair, the cable appeared well made and thick enough gauge, so perhaps I just got a bad one."
3,Wrong Cable Description,"Disappointed in the product because the description says DVI-D Dual Link Cable (has 25 pins per connector) and I clearly got a DVI-D Single Link Cable (has 19 pins per connector). You guys even have pictures of your product and you couldn't even give what your advertising, very disappointed."
5,good cable,"Hey, it's a cable, what do you want? It works if the connections at the ends it is connecting are right."
3,Video not sharp on TV,"I connected the HDMI cable to my video card (GeForce GT430) to my TV (50-inch Panasonic plasma 1080p) so I could watch TV programs on the big screen rather than the 19-inch monitor I have. The picture on the TV is OK, but there are artifacts and it isn't as sharp as I would have expected. There might be another reason other than the cable, but don't know what."
5,Perfect product for my older HD TV,I needed this cable to get the most out of my HD viewing of movies I get from Netflix. My tv doesn't have any HDMI input but it does have the DVI input. It worked great.
5,Priced well and works great,The DVI cable that came with my monitor failed and I bought this one to replace it. It shipped quickly and attaching it worked fine as there were no bent pins or other defects. The price the big box stores are charging for computer cables is criminal. Amazon is my go to place for replacements and this one worked perfect. I've been using it for about 4 months with zero problems.
5,Good,Lots of insulation. This cable was also stiff when first purchased. If your looking to zigzag this cable threw very small bends. it is not the one for you. I don't get any interference or anything the connectors were strong.No problems.Great Cable.Awesome Price.
5,Just a DVI.,"I bought this cable for my Pops. He wanted to use his TV as a second monitor, but it and his video card only had VGA in common. So I hooked up his monitor using DVI (which his video card had a port for too), and used the VGA cord he was using for his monitor to connect his TV. Worked out pretty well. The cable is just a standard DVI cable. I must stress though, if you are in the market for ANY cable that transmits a DIGITAL signal, don't buy the cords with all the bells and whistles like gold connectors etc etc. Things like that only help with transmitting analog signals. It could save quite a bit of money if you follow that advice. I hope I helped someone with this review."
4,It's a cable,"No, seriously. It's a cable. It's digital. It works. The connector is a little larger than the one that came with my other monitor. That's about all I have to say."
2,It took 2 Cables,The first cable I received had a loose pin and would pass only broken video. Amazon is great and immediately shipped me a new cable which works as it should. I can only say half of Cables To Go cables meet acceptable standards.
4,2M DVI Cable review,"Cable works fine (video quality great), but no threads on one of the screws that hold the cable to the female jack."
4,It works fine,"the screws are a little short, but it does not affect the overall quality of the product. works well with no visible difference in video quality between this or more expensive cables I own."
4,Good Value!,"I bought two of these, both coming at the same time but they were 2 different looking cables(both the correct cables) I received one of the white flimsy type where the screw doesn't reach all the way and I received what seemed like a higher quality black one that I had no problem with the screws. It's not like I take my computer and monitors anywhere and so the appearance of the cables didn't matter to me!Both work wonderfully though, I've had and been using them for 3 months now! Can't beat the price! Works great for 2 24"" 1080p monitors!"
5,"It's a cable, and it works!","Works just as well as the $100 cables, except that it's $90 cheaper. Buy this cable and spend $90 more on the monitor (or whatever else you're trying to connect it to) - you'll get more out of it."
4,As advertised on Amazon,"It gets the job done at a fair price. The cable came on time, I am pleased with this product. What else can I ask for?"
4,It s ok,"I thought, as the dvi-i is compatible to the down level dvi-d, the color in the monitor would be much better, but unfortunately it is not. My computer is connecting two monitors in the same model, one is using the original cable dvi-d, the other is this product. I compared the same picture in the monitors, the monitor by using the original cable is much better than the dvi-i. I really have no idea how come this happening. But anyway, it s still good for using! Thanks!The shipping is very fast!!"
3,Very thick cord that does not like bending,"I bought this because I had only a VGA cable previously with a DVI-VGA converter because my GFX card only outputs DVI. This meant I needed additional clearance for the converter between my tower and the wall. I thought this cable would help eliminate the converter and allow me to move my tower back at least 1.5"".Now it does eliminate the converter obviously, and works very well, but it barely gives me any additional clearance. This is because the cable is so thick it does not like bending. There's also a mild cracking sound if you bend it, almost as though it were brittle. I have my monitor mounted on an articulating arm, and this cable adds a lot more resistance when I need to fold or extend the arm."
3,Product Great - Application Unnecessary,I call Amazon for advice on purchasing my computer. I told them what I wanted to do and was advised by the agent I spoke with that I would need this cable to utilize digital signal from the computer. This was not the correct cable to make the connection. Regrettably the phone support Amazon offers when buying a computer it not totally technical savvy.
5,Works as expected,"It works as expected, the only problem is if you own Windows 7 64bit Operating System RTM, and if you decide to reinstall it on your hard drive. You'll come across a black screen on booting the freshly installed Operating System. This has nothing to do with this vendor's cable, It's something that Windows has to fix. Just switch to a VGA cable and then switch it back to DVI when the system boots. This is just a heads up for you all. Other than that it's a very good cable and well worth it's price, pretty great on shipping too if you would like to hear that from me.Oh yes another thing too, If you expect a big difference in quality when you switch to DVI from VGA. You will not really find much of a difference if you have a medium resolution on your monitor. The larger the screen resolution gets, the blurrier it will appear. DVI can relieve that quite effectively. There's no big boost in frames for games either. So don't expect a big boost on your games if you decide to switch."
2,Slight Disappointment,When I received the cable the pins and connectors were pretty beat up. I wasn't able to plug either end into a DVI port. Had to take needle nose pliers and unbend a lot of metal. Cable works fine though now that I fixed the pins.
4,Does the job. Why pay more?,"I bought four of these and plugged three into monitors and they all worked just fine. There really is no need to buy more expensive cables. The constuction and quality seem average. This is not a highend cable, but do you really need one? I'm using them on two 24"" monitors and a 27"" monitor and they all look good."
1,Wrong Cable,"I reported to Amazon that this was the wrong cable, Amazon preceded to send me the same product again. I notified them that I wanted a refund. As of now 12/19/09 Amazon has refunded my money & shipping expenses to ship it back."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay so i ordered this DUAL LINK DVI CABLE but they sent me a single link cable, do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Rated 4 stars cause I don't know what a 5 looks like!,"I dont know what the monster cable series dvi's look like so that's why the 4 stars but I can tell you the picture with 'cablestogo' is slightly better than component which I noticed on certain shows on DiscoveryHD but not much of a difference.All I really know is how much cheaper it is to monster,but I'm curious of the difference.I have the toshiba 30hf83 30"" which I love so someone tell me if the pic quality is better with monster(not the cord design,that I already know)I'd like to know."
5,Does what it's supposed to and does it well,"Great product, does what it is supposed to do. You can really feel the good quality of construction in this thing. Has nice thick insulation, perfect for if you have a lot of power cords overlapping places like me so that you don't get any noise in the signal if you have a hd that speeds up or a router that sends noise everywhere.This really is not a draw back at all, but to some; you might want to be aware that because this cable is of such high quality, the cable is naturally thicker and stiffer. It does bend pretty tight without putting any damage on it, but just be aware if you are trying to turn a corner within an couple inches. It really is a good product, and for a great amazon price! I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Works great,"This cable is sturdy, definitely wont cut easily or get damaged quickly. Very similar to a Monster cable.Originally got a Single-link cable but a quick e-mail to Customer service fixed that by sending me a the correct Dual-link cable.I will definitely be buying from them in the future."
1,This is not the cable shown in the picture,I expected this cable to have copper plugs like in the picture it does not. I already have a cheap DVI-D dual link cable that came with my monitor and expected this one to be as advertised not the cheap cable I received.
4,color me satisfied,"3 meter DVI cable appears as described. Works fine on my 1080p monitor. Cable is fat, and the screws turned easy.The white ends are stylish, but who cares?"
5,Yup those are cables,"A bit too short for my purposes but that was my fault for not getting the longer ones. Although it actually is the perfect length to my PC I feel like it should have a bit more slack, but oh well. The monitor I have hooked up with this cable is working and that's all I can ask for."
4,Cables,Exactlty what I needed. Nothing crazy about cable product. Does what it is suppose to do and a fantastic price.
1,some morons,"ordered a dual link got a single link. emailed, sent back to get the right product and have never got it back.Been two months now. How do you mess that up?"
5,Great picture quality,I've been using this cable for a couple of years now. Haven't had a single problem with it. Picture quality is phenomenal.
3,it does the job,"needed something longer than normal. it works as intended. however during installing the screw grip pins fell apart, leaving me to tighten it down with a pare of needle nose pliers"
4,"High quality cables, but...","some of the outside connectors were slightly bent. Probably happened during shipping. Some of the cables did not fit into the new monitors I just bought. I had to bend the outside of the connector back into place with pliers. Not a big deal, but thank goodness I didn't bend one of the pins! Otherwise these seem to be very durable cables."
1,"Dual link connectors, but not a dual link cable","The cable I received featured two male dual link DVI-D connectors as billed, but did not include the conductors required for the dual link. I figured this out by noting that (1) it would not support 2560 X 1600 resolution on my monitor like all other dual link DVI cables have, (2) the cable was approximately 1/2 as heavy in gauge as my other (shorter) dual link DVI cable, and (3) a simple ohmmeter measurement showed that the center two rows of pins (the second link pins) were not connected between connectors.Also, the connectors did not show identical aesthetic features and showed significant molding flash. All of this suggests that the cable may not be a ""Cables To Go"" cable, but possibly (although not provably) a knock-off."
1,cheap for a reason,"if you are looking for an expensive way to have DVI-D dual then this is your product. however if you are looking to get hi-definition from it then do NOT purchase this product. I purchased two of these cables, and both of them have been creating alot of random artifacts that are really annoying."
5,"Great quality, better price","Nice an beefy construction, thicker than the cables that came with my other monitor. No problems so far, and the price was great"
4,does what its supposed to do,this cable does what its supposed to do. i hooked up my laptop to a HD monitor and the picture is awesome.
3,No reviews and a high price,I am very tempted to order this DVD but I am put off by the lack of reviews for this high priced item. I am involved in hiring and recommending the hire of sales people. I am always looking to improve screening process.
2,They RAN before I had them up!,"I was really looking forward to these pantyhose. They looked beautiful in the package, they are lovely and very sheer. The lace top with cotton gusset was also great. The problems began when I put them on. I usually wear stockings, so I own hosiery gloves. Because these are pantyhose, for some reason I didn't think to wear the gloves. I definitely should have. They ripped as soon as I stepped into them. When I tried to pull them all the way on, even the lace top of the pantyhose ripped. I don't mean a RUN, they actually ripped! I was pretty disappointed. Not sure if they ripped because of the sheerness, or because I didn't wear hosiery gloves. I'd love to know if anyone else has had a similar experience."
3,A little one-sided,"The book harps on and on about the negative aspects of expatriate careers without going into the positives. Additionally, the expat is the primary focus of the book - very little attention is paid to the idea of managing HR from headquarters in an international context with employees local to each location (HCNs)."
4,Great for the MBA,This text assumes the user has HR experience and therefore can be challenging for the undergraduate with no working experience. It is excellent for the masters level student and provides a wide view of international H R challenges. Cases at the end of the book provide real perspectives and identify a variety of topics explored in the text.
4,Satisfied Customer,The textbook was shipped to me in a timely manner and was in the condition as promised.
3,Great Camera except in low light,"The Optio 555 has a great feature set and is a great size. Its outdoor picture are perfect, however indoors in low light the pictures are very grainy. My Olympus 3.3MP takes better pictures indoors."
1,Zero stars for this piece of junk,"This cd is so worthless. It boasts, ""original artists, original masters"". I didn't know the original masters were mono record dubs that have lots of scratches, and faded-in intros. Not to mention that they got three titles (and technically, four, if you go by the titles on the original 45s and LP's) wrong on the cd. Do not waste your money on this, buy the Best Of cd on Stardust instead."
5,Sony AC-L10A AC Adapter,Was great to find this item for my camera. Works great and searched all over to find it since it is an old camera.
3,Ac-L10a power adaptor,It is a good adapter and seems to works for my camera but not the AC-L10A that I ordered. Instead I received an AC-L15B it seems to meet the power requirements in specs. I hope it won't damage my camera? Service was fast and the price was reasonable. I am happy!Update: used adapter for 2nd time and the lead cord that was shipped with it blew up at the entry point to the adapter could not use it. Sparks all over scared the witts out of me. This was supose to be new. Will notify shipper.
5,Truth,"This is an excellent video by people who are in the LDS church. It is a series of statements made by LDS scientists who are troubled by DNA evidence that clearly shows that the Native Americans are descendants of people in the Far East. This is in direct opposition to the teaching of the church which states that Native Americans were descended from Jews, 500 years before the time of Christ. It will be interesting to see how the LDS church interprets these facts, for they are facts, not opinion."
1,Hopelessly outdated before it was even published,"In a field that measures quantum change in months rather than years, this work is hopelessly outdated in terms of the science and the assumptions behind it. The same scientific community that confidently announced the beginning of the next ice age in the 1970s predictably underestimates the limitations of their knowledge and overstates the reach of current DNA science to make conclusive determinations of the origins of populations.I also find it very interesting to see Christian skeptics of Mormonism use this as a means of supposedly undermining the tenants of the Mormon faith, while apparently willfully overlooking what the scientific community has to say about creationism, evolution, and other tenants of Christianity as a whole that are completely incompatible with the same science that they use to criticize others. Ultimately religious belief is not established through scientific research but through a personal relationship with God."
1,go to the professionals to dig deeper !,"""There is almost no science in this video and what there is is outdated or irrelevant. MtDNA is largely irrelevant in detecting Israelite origins as many known Jewish communities were founded by local women and Israelite men. It fails to mention the M346 Y-chromosome mutation which is found in the Middle East but not East Asia. The majority of Native Americans share the M346 mutation with Yemenite Jews and Arabs. This video also fails to address the 1996 finding of Underhill that using observed mutation rates (Weber & Wong), most American Indians are descended from a man who lived around 151 BC. At this very moment it is possible to find Arabs and Mexicans of the Q1a3a haplogroup and by using Kayser's observed rate of 28 per 10,000, calculate the birth of a theoretical common ancestor less than 3,000 years ago."""
1,Interesting,"An interesting DVD. There is, however, much evidence which is entirely left out of the report, including possible roots tracing back to earlier ""Asiatic"" peoples - even before the alleged prophet ""Lehi"" journeyed across the Atlantic - and other omissions of historical facts and other necessary considerations.In short, I would not commend this film as an accurate portrayal of the truth. Currently, much evidence points against it. That is not to say that it is not entirely true in its representation - but from an academic point of view, it could be false grounds for coming to a conclusion based on an incomplete investigation. In my own investigation, I trust that truth will be found from its original source."
4,"Camera is fine, the camera dock is not the greatest.",I liked the price of the set and having the ability to print pictures with the printer dock is a good idea but I am having problems with the film cartridges not matching up with the number of photo cards that come in the set plus I am also having problems with the photo cards not feeding in to the printer correctly. You may want to buy the 160 photo cards set as the cost per picture is a lot less than the 40 or 80 card bundles.
2,Short lived!,"We have been disappointed with both camera and printer during the two and a half years we've had them. We had to send the camera back twice during the first year for repairs after lengthy, tedious phone conversations with the company to assure them repeatedly that ""no, it has not been immersed in liquid"" and to go through a list of very obvious things to check for and eliminate reasons for it malfunctioning. The closure for the battery is now broken on the camera - we gave up and got a Nikon, which we love. My sister had similar problems with her Kodak in a short time period as well. The printer has been very temperamental and has finally died completely.Good quality pictures, easy to use, but I'd recommend paying a bit more to get a product that will last longer and be more reliable. We have given up on Kodak."
5,Kodak Easyshare is fantastic!,This camera is very easy to operate and takes really clear pictures. The printer prints excellent pictures - all around a GREAT buy! The only thing you might want to do is buy a memory disk because one does NOT come with the camera.
4,Great Buy,"I bought this camera for my teenage daugther. And she love it to deaf. This is the besy buy of the year, she can't put it down. It's a space saver."
1,Great TEMPORARY Camera,Kodak makes great temporary cameras.Only lasts about 1-2 years.Get the warrenty if you purchase this camera.Takes decent pictures while it works.
2,Wear your earplugs!,"I too rushed out to buy this toy for my 2 1/2 year old based on the commercials. I also bought an extra ""Dora"" cartridge. My daughter played with this toy in the store and I was surprised at how LOUD they had it set. I figured I'd be able to lower the volume when we got home, but I was wrong! There IS NO volume! For the price of this toy it should definitely be able to be turned down to a more comfortable level. My daughter can't play with it long because she doesn't like anything loud. After a while, it's very annoying. If it had a volume control, I would recommend it highly."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to buy this toy. My two year olds love music and many of the characters in the cassettes. In a short time when the pages advanced they were unaligned and where calling yellow, blue. Nothing like confusing a child. Then it stopped responding altogether. I bought another because I had all of the cartridges and my children liked it when it worked and the new one does not advance properly either.Great idea but needs a few bugs worked out."
2,A WASTE OF TIME,"We really did love this toy, except for the fact that it was very loud, but 2 months after Christmas the pages were jamming. I changed the batteries, put in a different cartridge. But alas it was broken, so I bought another one and exchanged the broken one...well the new one broke within a month (same problem). My kid didn't even mistreat it because I would supervise him while he played with it (his idea).So I got rid of the cartridges and then he would play with just the lights and sounds but the lights were too bright. So now it's in a closet somewhere. I'll throw it out when I clean out the closet. Just trying to help."
4,Microphone issues,"Just wanted to give a little info in regards to Fisher Price. Our microphone broke about a month after we purchased the Learn Through Music toy. But kudos to Fisher Price. I called the customer service number shared the problem and they asked us to cut off the microphone, send it to them with a print label they emailed me and they sent us a new toy. Can't be that. I don't know why the microphone stopped working but otherwise the toy has been lots of fun and the cartridges really interest my 2 year old daughter."
1,Screen has a mind of it's own...Frustrates your little one...,"Just a few weeks after my daughter got this for Christmas last year, it started freaking out, for lack of a better term. The screen would rewind back to the beginning for no reason. She would get upset and tell me it was broke. I thought the batteries were dying but it wasn't that. Tried to wipe the screen cleaner thinking it was reading ""fingerprints"" but that didn't help either. The pages trun whenever they want, and now it will only advance a couple of pages, then automatically rewind. We have the Elmo cartridge and a Barney cartridge, and both do it. She uses it now just to sing into the microphone.My sister-in-law says the same happens with her daughter's, too. So I have to beleive it's the toy."
2,Didn't last very wrong.,"This toy was bought as a gift for my daughter's 2nd B-day.(December) She loves the toy!!!!!! We have to bring it everywhere. Without the volume control I would have died. The only bad thing about this toy is that it only lasted until early February. Some of the buttons you would press wouldn't work. The mic cut out all the time. And then finally the page would freeze. Now the toy has just stopped working. Changing the batteries didn't help. We're in the process of getting another one from fisher-price. However, I do recommend this toy. Maybe we just had a bad one."
1,Toy is dangerously Loud!!!,"According to toysafety.net this toy is too Loud!!!! Above 85 decibels!!!I am taking the one I got my 22-month-old for Christmas back to the store! I thought it was loud but figured there may be a switch to turn it down in the back. Apparently not. Your child will be going deaf by the time they get to kindergarten with excessive use of this toy!!!Learn Through MusicCategory: Excessively loud toysManufacturer: Fisher-PriceItem Number: B8729/89452 Asst.Maximum Decibel Measurement:25 cm: 9210 cm: 1021 cm: 110Problem: Should not exceed 90 dB from 25 cm. Child would likely play with this toy at a closer distance than 25 cm, in order to participate in the interactive aspects of the toy on a small screen. Prolonged exposure to noise above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss."
2,Don't bother...,"This toy is as the other reviews have stated. First, it is way too loud of a toy. When buying it for Christmas and trying it out at the store, we assumed there would be a volume control. There wasn't. Usually with noisy toys, you ""get used to it."" Not with this toy. It is obnoxious. Exactly the same problem with the advancement of the pages. They either get stuck or play a different page. As for the screen, it is definatley too hard to distinquish. My 2 year old does play with it, but doesn't hold her attention for too long. Maybe because it is way too loud for her too! And like the others also stated, I wish that I read the reviews also before buying. My loss..."
2,Fun while it lasted,"This was great while it lasted - hasn't even been a month since Christmas and it's broken. The cartridges don't move forward or backword anymore - if they do move once in a while - they are on the wrong page so it asks the child to push a number, my daughter will push the number 4 and it says 10. REally disappointed in the quality for the cost. The only thing that still does work is the microphone which my duaghter (age 2) still has fun talking into. My advise: save the box and receipt so that you can return it when yours breaks."
3,Not satisfied,"We bought this toy for our daughter for christmas.It doesnt have one light that lights up. It has circular dots that light up on the screen. You can't see the screen very well. I don't know if there's somthing wrong with ours or this is how it is made.Also After 1 day of use it stopped working. I changed the batteries a few times that was not the problem. I returned it.We bought it because it looked like a fun educational toy. Before it stopped working it was,But we were still were going to take it back because of the lighting."
1,1 Star is 1 Star TOO MANY!,"A Christmas gift - that never worked! I am SO dissappointed! I was looking forward to my son playing this and learning...... It is a piece of garbage!!!!!!!!!! Unfortunately, the boxes were all burned XMAS morning - and I fear I am stuck with this! The pages stick on all 3 cartridges, I tried changing the batteries (wishful thinking), Nothing!!!!! Matel is on my S**T list this XMas - also purchased Mission Select Rescue Heroes - Billy Blazes says he is Matt Medic and Matt thinks he's Billy! Boy is Mattel gonna hear from me!!!!!!!!!!Angry in Connecticut!"
3,Good concept but boring to an 18 mo. old,"Sounds like a good idea but get it home and it is forgotten among the real electronics. The colors are not bright and the lights flashing are more of a distraction than interesting. If you have older kids (I have an 18 mo. old and 4 yr old), the younger will want to be doing what big brother is - like leapster - not playing with this toy."
5,wonderful!!!!,"I bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday from a suggestion of a friend. She didn't play with it until a couple of months later. She touched it and elmo started singing and she started dancing. She hasn't put it dowm since. All we hear is elmo, elmo, elmo. But my daughter loves it. It was well worth the money. She is learning and having a fun time!"
1,A good idea that needs to be reworked!!!,"I want to add my two cents to the unsatisfactory reviews. I was really excited about this toy, as my 2-year old daughter really loves music, singing, Elmo etc. I would, however, give it a zero rating if I could, because we couldn't even use it. I read the reviews and figured the odds would be with us regarding its performance, but I was wrong! The screen is very dark (why??), with those annoying dots of light behind, and it wouldn't advance properly as soon as we began playing. Hopefully, FP will get the hint and pull this toy until it can be revamped. 30 days refund policy or no, I will be getting my money back for the toy and the two extra cartridges"
2,Great toy but TOO loud,"This is a favorite toy among my children ages 2-6. I thought it would be a great toy to bring in the car so they could play with it while waiting. BAD idea, it is so loud, I can barely hear anything else. Otherwise, it's very durable (we have 7 children), it's lasted through being dropped, stepped on, fought over, etc. I put a pc of tape over the speaker, which has helped a little, but now the younger one can't play with it (she eats the tape)."
3,Already broken,"Bought this toy for Christmas and 2 more tapes (Blues Clues & Dora). It's now January, and it is not working right after some minor abuse from my 17 month old. He doesn't seem interested anymore anyway. There goes $...down the drain."
1,It's Great Until It Breaks!!,"My son got this for his second birthday last month. Within a week, it broke. The microphone did not work and the screens would not advance. I took it back and exchanged it for another one. Again, within a week that one broke. My son really loved playing with this when it worked, so I exchanged that one and got a third one. Within four days that one broke!!! My son does not play rough with his toys and I can't believe that Fisher Price would make something that can't stand up to a toddler. I usually love Fisher Price toys, but I am very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend it. We purchased the Fisher Price Power Touch learning system for our son for Christmas and I really hope that it's more durable than this."
3,"Educational, but needs some work","This is a good educational toy for a young child (ages 2-3) and comes with cartridges featuring characters from all the current popular kids shows. There are two volume options on the back switch so concern about damaging a child's ears is not a question. The music can sometimes be misaligned with the cartridge screen, but after fideting with the toy and trying different things (turning on/off, switching cartridges), I am able to get the cartridges in sync with the correct music. When the unit does not have a cartridge, it plays music tunes, pressing the buttons changes the instrument playing the music. One drawback to this toy is the somewhat dim screen that makes it difficult to see in dim lighting. Overall, this toy is better than other toys of the same price in the sense that it offers educational value by integrating music with learning."
3,Fun but not long lasting...,"My 2 yr old son received this toy for Christmas this year. He had lots of fun pushing the buttons and watching the reel flip to the next page. The first problem I noticed with it, was that it seemed to get stuck sometimes where the reel would not move at all. For some reason the cartridge would not sit all the way in there and would cause is not to work.Now, being that 2 yr olds generally like to throw anything they can get their hands on, my son has thrown this toy a few times. He got it on Christmas day and now less than one month later it doesn't work at all. This toy was not made to withstand the rough play of a 2 yr old child. But it was fun while it lasted."
4,Fun and Great Activity Toy,"My daughter really enjoys this toy, along with her little friends. I, as a mother, enjoy listening to her sing and repeat the characters. The singing activity she really gets into and we see her character come out a great deal. The only thing that I would change is the lenghth of the string to the microphone, but I understand the safety precautions that must be taken into consideration."
2,Don't bother.,"I am a big fan of educational toys but I believe there are much better ones on the market. This toy is loud and obnoxious. I agree with the reviewer who felt the screen was dark. I also feel that it is hard to manipulate. Also, the quality is not what I would expect from fisher-price. Even after a battery change, the screen refused to advance. Returned to the store within days."
2,No Learning Here,"How can Fisher Price teach shapes and colors when you cant see the screen? It is so dark... NOTHING like all the brightly lit screens on the box and in ads. I feel scammed with deceptive advertising. Unfortunately, The system and cartridges were given by different people and I cannot return. My 2 year old loves the music (when volume is on LOW) so thats the only thing we can use it for. Shame on Fisher Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Fun toy for small children,I have 21 month old twin grandsons and they really like toys that sign and talk to them. They can even talk to this one and it's recorded and they think that is great.
2,Too loud and microphone breaks,Great idea for a toddler toy but the microphone breaks or cracks when trying to work. We use the volume but it still seems loud. This toy need improvements because it's another cute toy!
1,The Worst Toy I ever Bought,"This is the biggest waste of money I have spent since we had our 17 month old! The microphone does not work after the first day, and the cartriges don't advance properly...So my son is learning about the color yellow as Joe from Blue's Clues speaks, but my son is looking at the ""BLUE"" page!I am truly disappointed, and I would not recommend to anyone this toy.It is a wonderful concept, and very easy for a little one to use...But you would think Fisher Price would have done a little more durability testing with it BEFORE they put it on the market!"
3,"Good Toy, If You Have The New Model W/ Voice Control","My 13 month old loves this toy. Unfortunately, we have the older model that did not come with voice control.The volume is TOO LOUD!!! It's so loud, I'm worried it will end up damaging my son's hearing. It is really that loud. And, no matter where it is in the house, you will hear it when it's on. It can get on a parent's nerves very quickly due to the loudness.If you buy one of the new ones, with the voice control, it will be a great, durable toy. My son has thrown, banged, stepped on, etc this toy so many times, I'm suprised it still works."
1,"La, la, la, laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",Received this toy as a birthday gift for my 2 year old. After only a few weeks (and not constant use/abuse) it broke. Either the slides would keep moving or they would studder and stop in the middle of 2 slides. Also read a report on the toy safety website (toysafety.net) that warned this toy could cause hearing damage because of the noise level and how close the child has to be to use the microphone. Anyway... this toy was returned for something else.
2,No Volume and a Dark Screen,"I think the concept is great. My son (3) likes it. However, this toy is LOUD with no volume adjustment. This may be good for a play environment with lots of background noise (like jet engines, jackhammers, etc.) The screen is DARK and produces a horrible glare when used in a normally lit room. It's a good toy, but it needs improvements."
1,Terrible!,"Uggh! I saw this at(...)while shopping with my son and he loved pushing on the buttons so I bought it.When I got home, my mom and I looked at it more closely and found that it is a terrible toy! Why? You can't see the screen! It is VERY VERY dim. It gave my a headache looking at it. The colors are difficult to distinguish, I think we kept getting orange and red mixed up because they looked the same.Basically, this toy is too expensive and difficult to use. Buy a cheaper to with buttons and noise, don't buy this. I love the idea of this toy, but will wait a year or two until Fisherprice comes out with an improved version (which I'm sure will happen when the technology gets better.)Hope that helps!"
2,Major Disappointment,"I think this toy is a wonderful concept, but on the first day that we bought it, it was malfunctioning. Like other reviewers have stated, the screen did not match up with the sounds. Also I did not care for the picture quality on the screen. The lights in the back ground made it difficult for my child to see the pictures. I bought the Dora cartridge, and my two year old showed very little interest, which is strange because she normally loves anything with Dora. I am returning this toy, and the two extra cartridges that go with it, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
2,Christmas Disappointment,"Unfortunately this toy did not meet my expectations. I bought it for my two year old for Christmas. Within a few hours, the screen did not advance properly and the page did not match up with the narration. It was difficult for my son to understand when to advance a page and what exactly he was supposed to do next. Even with my help he became disinterested quickly. I will be returning this product and replacing it with something similar. I thought because of the music factor this would be more fun for him than some of the other brands, but it turns out it was just a waste of money."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a total piece of junk. Me and my wife bought this toy for my son for xmas but the toy has already broken and it is only 2 days old. I wish I had read the reviews before I had bought. The problem with the toy I think, is that the gears inside are cheap plastic that wear out fast and allow the toy to not advance as it should which makes the speak and games mis align with the correct screen. either way I love fisher price toys but this one is a big upset and a waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. It would be quicker to flush the money in the toilet than to buy this toy."
4,Great toy!!!,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old son for his birthday in August. And it has been a great toy every time we have visitors there kids love it. My son loves to dance to the music and he can advance to the next page easily without help. The only complaint is that it's kind of loud and there's no volume control. But there is an off and on button, just in case. Besides the noice level this is a great toy."
3,"It's an ""okay"" toy","My 21 month old got this toy with the Elmo cartridge for Christmas. So far, he's only interested in making the screen move...hopefully that will change. We haven't had any problems that others have stated (so far). The only two problems I have with it is that it's too dim and it's super loud!"
3,POOR QUALITY,I HAVE TO SAY I RAN OUT AND BOUGHT ONE FOR MY 2 YEAR OLD. hE PLAYED WITH IT FOR FOR 1 NIGHT AND THE THING BROKE. IT DOES NOT STOP AT EACH SCREEN. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. I EVEN CHANGED THE BATTERIES THINKING THATS WHAT IT COULD BE. THE ARROWS SENDS THE SCRREN WHERE EVER IT FEELS LIKE.
1,Don't do it!,"Don't waste the [money]on this toy. I would not have minded spending the money if only the toy would work properly. I bought the first one which both my kids loved. They got a kick out of singing along and the microphone was the best part. I got lucky, my microphone worked for about a month. When it broke, I took it back and exchanged it for another one hoping it was just a fluke. Now the microphone on the second one is broken after only 2 weeks! I have given up and decided to go with a karaoke machine instead."
2,A big disappointment,I had seen the ads for this toy and rushed out to buy it for my 25 mos old daughter.What a dissapointment. First off..this toy is very LOUD! And there is no volume control. Second..the screen is very dark and it is hard to make out the images. Third..we have the Elmo cartridge and it is very hard to make out the sounds and understand what they are singing or saying because of their voices (in character).I would not recommend this for anyone. It is a big disappointment!
2,Lots of fun but didn't survive my 2 year old!,"Learn through music was a total hit with my daughter. she loved it so much that we bought every cartridge that went with it. After a couple of trips in the car, the screen became stuck on spot. It was like an invisible finger was constantly pushing one area. We loved the toy so much we bought another one and just thought we would be extra careful with it. No such luck. The next one just stopped working period (it wouldn't advance through the story-new batteries and all). I would buy yet another one if I thought it would last but I doubt it. Its a great idea but its no good if it won't work!!"
2,Too Dark To See,"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old and returned it the next day. The screen is too dark to see. For the amount of money you pay for it and all the video games and high def. stuff out there, you would think they could make the screen so you could see it. Did not like it at all."
1,Very Disapointed!!!,"My daughter who is 2 just recieved Learn through Music for christmas 3 days ago, and the thing already broke. The pages jam, not wanting to turn and when they do its on the wrong screen with the music. We even tried to change the batteries, but didnt help. We returned it last night at the store, and now I'm glad that they were out of stock after reading all of the reviews that others had the same problem with 2 of them. We will be returning the cartridges today so we don't have to deal with it again. Although we are very disapointed, my daugher was looking forward to enjoying this toy for a long time. I thought Fisher-Price stuff was durable. Take my advice.. THINK TWICE before you buy this toy, it will save you the hassle of returning and frustration."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TOY--IT WILL BREAK!,"Online I thought this toy looked fun & educational, so I purchased three of them for numerous kids on my list. All three in the hands of different children broke within 3 months of limited use!This toy is a waste of money!"
3,a little loud and good for two and up,"My daughter rec'd this toy when she was just over one years old. she has issues with using the mic, you must hold the button down to make the mic work. i also wished that the volume was able to be adjusted."
2,Dissapointing.,This toy would be great if you could see what was going on on the screen. Only little points of light light up on the screen and make it difficult to really engage a child for very long. It just doesn't seem to interest my toddler at all. I'm sorry that I spent the money on it.
1,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with this toy. It sounded like a great educational toy, but the screen is so dark that it's difficult to see colors or pick out pictures. The pages also stick sometimes and the cartridges make a really loud noise every time the toy rewinds. I would not recommend it, especially if you're looking for something educational."
5,awesome toy,"My twin daughters received this for Christmas at 18 mos.They have 4 different cartridges, and have played with this toy everyday!!. The cartridges are easy for them to put in by themselves, so they can pick which one they would like to play with. It is difficult for them to get the cartridges out, because they do lock into place, but no problem! My daughters have learned alot and will play with this toy for long periods of time...i.e 30-45 minutes at one sitting. Great Toy!"
3,So LOUD that my child can't play with it for long.,"Overall. my child enjoys this toy. However, it is so unbearably loud that even my ranbunctious toddler can't stand for it to be on for very long. We have a rule in our house that it must stay in his playroom. And it's an ongoing joke that if Mommy and Daddy are in the playroom and he plays with it, we get to leave the room.Also, after just a few weeks of play, the microphone now rarely works."
3,The OTHER bento box cookbook,"Bah. This isn't authentic bento fare. It's a foodie interpretation. And these are not even REAL bento boxes. You can't take a bento box with you that has a bowl of soup in it and stuff on a leaf. I mean, really. It's all so - look at us we are chef-ies making bento better than the Japanese!Pretty pictures though for the most part but I am not about to make Grilled Quail or Rack of Lamb for my bento. Kind of defeats the whole idea of SIMPLE.These recipes are actually NOT simple in any way. Simple to me would be Chicken Teriyaki, Fried rice and Japanese pickles.Get the REAL bento box cookbook by an actual Japanese chef - Bento Boxes: Japanese Meals on the Go by Naomi Kijima. That's my bento bible!"
5,The Story Behind The Album,"Inspired by Joni James' brilliant work with ""100 Strings and Joni,"" M-G-M Records sent Connie Francis to London to work the same production team to do two albums, this one and ""For the Boys,"" a tribute to male singers completed but never released (it is now available as part of a Bear Family box set). This album was supposed to be a tribute to British composers, and two other tracks were recorded, another lyric to ""I'll Close My Eyes"" and ""Good Night, Good Luck, God Bless You."" When M-G-M got the finished album, it began reconsidering the commercial appeal to the U.S. public of a British music tribute. So the album emerged with no reference whatsoever as to what it was all about, which made no sense at all, and it didn't sell as well as M-G-M hoped. It's still a beautiful project, however."
5,"Welcome Back, Connie!","I don't remember how Connie was introduced into my life, but I do remember the music. When I was in kindergarten back in the late 1960's one of my older sisters had to sing a Connie song with me before I would go to sleep. This was one of the two albums we had, and I just wore the grooves out of them both. Great sentimental ballads all. I'm so excited to have the chance to listen to it again without all the pops and hisses I added as a child! Anyone who likes Ms. Francis' music in the least will enjoy this gem."
5,for me - worth the money,"This is the only foundation that makes my skin look like my skin only flawless. The color match for me is perfect (blush ivory) Ive tried all kinds of stuff and this is the best. Plus one bottle lasts the better part of 2 years.....Ive got t-zone issues as well, and this keeps that at bay the best too. Mac blot powder takes care of the rest. Must have."
2,False advertising,"Although this book is easy, it's not what I thought it was. This is a gospel, scripture, church, hymn etc. songbook. The songs as stated are easy, but that's not what I was looking for when I read ""All The Best Songs For Easy Guitar"" I was expecting to find Easy listening, campfire tunes, country etc. But I'll keep it because there's nothing wrong with teaching children hymns. Only 2 stars for advertising."
1,Bland Tasting Candy.,"The look of the bag is deceiving because when you taste the caramel, the favor is only there for few seconds before turning into impossibly edible lump of a matter. Kraft needs to redo the formula to make the taste to last longer."
1,Not even accurate,"I just bought the book this week and when I finally had a chance to look at it I am extremely disappointed. I flipped directly to the chapter that is my primary concern: language. The entire chapter talks all about Swiss German. One doesn't have to know much about Switzerland to know how multi-lingual the country is. The book doesn't mention anything about French, Italian, or Romansh. Highly recommend NOT buying this book and finding your information elsewhere."
3,Getting it wrong form the beginning,"It has been a long time since I read a book that both frustrated me and at the same time challenged the most fundamental ""truths"" that I have been taught about education. It is easy to both love some of the insights in this book and then be left lost trying to understand the alternative. I think I would of gained a better understanding of Egan's insights if I had read the predecessor The Educated Mind. One of Egan's main arguments is that the progressive school and its theories have resulted in ""the reduction of academic content in primary schools in the 20th century"". All the emphasis on making learning ""natural"" and ""play-like"" has cheated American students out of acquiring ""cultural-cognitive tools"" which should be the basis of all education. He challenges many of the long held beliefs of education and if anything I would recommend this book as a way of reconsidering the psychological pillars of education that all new teachers are trained in."
5,Chan Furniture's Brookdale Vanity,"The vanity is beautiful and arrived within a week. Paul was very helpful and answers inquiries in a very timely manner. I will definitely buy from them again.C.R. Stormville,NY"
5,New user,"I have only begun using the scar therapy pads for 2 days and so far it seems to be working. I am using it on some scars (due to gallbladder surgery)that are around 13 yrs old, and already they are looking more pale. I agree that they are quite expensive, especially if you have mulitiple scars that you want to treat. However, since my scars are small, I find cutting the pads into multiple strips a good way to save some money. Also, the pads seem to stay stuck on my skin pretty well, so I haven't had the need to use the enclosed adhesive strips. They are probably useful if you want to bathe with the pads on or if you perspire too much. I will post another review at the end of the 8 weeks."
4,Very Good,"I really like Moragan Llywelyn, and I was glad to find a book about a female legend--Grania. ""Grace O'Malley""--the name given to her by the English--is portrayed in this book as strong, fierce, intelligent, a lover, and entirely human. Grania, in her adventures, learns to outwit many people, humble herself when necessary, and manages to keep her sense of humor throughout her life. This story is for anyone who likes to have a great time reading."
3,More of a biography,"I must say, of the novels I have read about real female pirates, I am least impressed with this one. Having just completed the novel, I cannot decide if I find the heroine to be foolish and cocky, or brave and amazing. On one hand, she grabs life by the horns so to speak and shows the men of the times that women are worthy adversaries indeed. On the other hand, a lot of her decisions hurt other people. Waging wars and looting ships may have helped her select few, but what of others? This novel was also written more like a biography (except the sex scenes and tidbits of conversation here and there). I had to skip a page and half every now and then as I grew weary of reading who was from what clan and what had become of so and so, some of which was irrelevant to the story line. The best part of the book was when she finally had a face to face meeting with Elizabeth Tudor, and it took the entire book to finally reach it."
2,A disappointment,"Alas, it seems that every legendary writer must have his low point. After an amazing streak of masterpieces Morgan Llwellyn has proved she is only human after all with the muddled, confusing, and boring ""Grania"". I skimmed over the past previous and I must say I am surprised by the amount of credit and praise this book received. It truly deserves neither. It was pointless and trivial, Ms. Llwellyn never made me care whether Grania lived or die, and frankly after about 100 pages of her stupidity I almost wish she had. A waste of paper and time. Save yourself the trouble and read ""Lion of Ireland"" again."
5,Versatility,"I have always thought about her but never bought her cd's.I love Madonna, I love disco and funk.As an american looking for this sound I have stuck gold.Light Years, Fever and Kylie's greatest hits,I have them alland play them all the time now.This cd is a great palate cleaner.It shows she is an artist with an agenda. I now love Kylie.The first time I heard this cd I really didn't get it. Now I do.Every cut on this disc is great. Did it again and tears are AAA+++ When I lived in Europe people in Germany called her the other Madonna. She is. Disco, rock or ballad she is simply the best. I will buy the next cd unheard."
4,Perfecto~,"Whether your a new, or old fan of Kylie's this cd is perfect for you! The collection of songs, some of which are unreleased or in a different version, will surely put a smile on your face. You might have to listen to it over and over before you grow to love it, but by then you'll be so happy u bought this cd!-Confide in me - a beautiful, cool song with strings violins and percussion (5/5)-Put yourself in my place - and absolutely catchy ballad. Just cause its slow doesn't mean you have to switch tracks. trust me, keep listening and you'll love it! (5/5)-Did it again - a cute up beat song (4/5)- Breahte- not too fast not too slow, but a sexy tune (4/4)- Difficuly by design - another cute, up beat song (4/4)- Automatic love - a pretty song. This is the acoustic version, which is even more beautful (4.5/)-Take me with you - there's just something about this track that I love. Maybe its the eclectic sounds, and mellow voice of Kylie. Anyways I love it, u should give it a listen! (5/5)"
5,One of Kylie's Best Albums!!!!,I think that this album is one of Kylie's best albums.Here's what are my favorite songs off the album:1. TearsThis is a cool song. I wish that this would have been a hit song here in the us.2. Difficult By DesignA good dance beat3. If you don't love meA good slow song4. Stay This WayA good slow song5. Take Me With YouA good slow song6. Where The Wild Roses GrowA good spooky sounding song7. BreatheProbably the most song I like off the album from one of her old songs.
1,Kylie's age of pretention,"Well, Kylie is rubbish really and these sound like a bunch of songs Madonna rejected and have been saved from the cutting room floor....Oh and I bet Ms Minogue never wrote a single one of them, that's the ironic thing about Kylie which seems amusing, she releases a great song which in turn gives her some fleeting credibility (something which she has strived for all throughout her career)and they turn out to be songs written by an 80's pop hasbeen normally. Kylie's always taken the easy option out when it comes to taking risks and in achieving respect from her peers and universal credibility in the music press, but this is an album dedicated to an era in which Ms Minogue took herself far too seriously (like Kylie is known for) but at least she doesn't pretend any longer, put it on if you have to and enjoy the worst part of Kylie's disastrous career."
2,a few good tips..,"A few pearls, but not a lot of substance to this little set. I think the advice on these tapes is more geared towards old fashioned couples. As a woman, I had a hard time relating to much of what the author was saying about women. It seemed like he was talking more about my grandmother and what might tug at her heartstrings. Well, a lot has changed since then."
1,Disappointment,"Mr. Snyder has written in a style that includes sarcasm and exageration. This is aimed to be humor, but I find makes it difficult to perceive what the true point really is. He includes many personal experiences that do not correlate his main points and seem often foolish."
4,A good reference source,"The author uses a lot of never before published material from the PRO, UK. Many maps and orders of battles which are just fantastic. Despite what the other reviewer said, this is a good book for reference on this very obscure period. Bar none! The author focuses on the North and South Russian Intervention by the US and UK, details the use of tanks and eyewitness accounts. Numerous battle sequences. Parts are well written and quite interesting like the costs to the UK to sponser and support the White army under Denikin in 1919, how the British captured Tsaritsyn (Stalingrad)with tanks and so on. I think it is a gold mine of information."
4,Flying Lizards have returned,"I first started listening to the Lizards in about '84, and have been searching for this release on cd since the early nineties -- if for no other reason than for White Convertable. I'm glad to see that they haven't been entirely forgotten, and that some of the new alternative music fans are starting to learn that the music they think is new is, in many cases, a sound pioneered 15 or more years ago. Thanks, Amazon, for offering the Lizards again."
4,flying lizards,"money that's what I want.i was left satisfied,that's what I want.really got song off movie lord of war.did rest until I found album.amazom had what I wanted."
3,new wrestling today,"T.N.A wrestling its new 6 rings, the show is very new and in time it will be compared to the W.W.E, they are growing in there own way, don,t knock Vince McMahon, getting where he is took a great amount of time, T.N.A is and will grow its own way and in it,s time"
3,It's no Bullitt or Dirty Harry,I'm a huge fan of cop films set in 60s and 70s San Fran like Bullitt and Dirty Harry so I decided to check this out. It captures 70s San Fran pretty well but the show itself is trite and cheesy.
5,The Streets Of San Francisco,"Classic Drama. Sleek, everything you expect from a cop show. Douglas and Malden in fine form and a feast of fine guest stars."
5,A real classic,"After watching the whole first season and half of the second, I now realize why I don't care for the new shows. The acting is so-so,the writing worse, they all depend on flashy effects and editing,too many closeups of actors faces ect. This show made you feel you were going along with them as they solved the cases. Great, just great television, which I'm afraid will never be again."
4,try ebay,"I bought most of the series from a guy on ebay. The quality was pretty good overall, certainly worth the $50 I paid for 100 episodes, including the pilot.The show itself does a nice job of capturing the time. Malden and Douglas were a good tandem.The 4 act structure was the norm back then. Surf the net a little before you pay 35+ bucks for half a season"
1,I am NOT Buying a Half Season Paramount,Get it together... We are not spending 30.00 plus dollars for a half of a season. I want the show but not half of the season. We want season sets not cheated for a full season it would cost over 60.00/// THis was my first post... I did in fact end up buying the DVD set. I just wish for more Full Season releases of TV shows. Paramount is doing the same thing to The Mod Squad TV series this Dec 18th. It just makes sales worse for shows in half seasons and usually what happens is the studios end up not releasing the rest of the series once they think it doesn't sale at all.
5,STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO IS FABULOUS,"I really enjoyed this series, and I hope that they continue the series. The acting is superior and that fact that they had English subtitles really help. That is why I like DVD's so much-so much is lost just by listening. The stories are excellent, and you do not get series like this in today's world. Please let them continue with this series."
3,Didn't realize it was only 1/2 of Season 1,"This is the only tv series that I have ever bought that separates the series into 2 sets, and yet both are at full set prices. Absurd.I love the show and it gets 5 stars.But having only 1/2 is a rip-off. And doing this for Every season is taking advantage of a great show and its fans. 1/2 a season gets 0 stars.Karl and Douglas make a great partnership and play well off each other. It just makes the show move along, because of their personalities. The familiar guest stars also add well to the show.Get a good show in all ways."
4,Stop comparing to today's shows!,"People keep complaining about the pricing of a half season of these older shows compared to full seasons of current shows. Apparently, none of you are old enough to remember how many more episodes a season lasted and how many FEWER commercials they had back then! One I looked at had 32 episodes/season compared to 23 now. We also used to have about 10-15 mins of commercials per hour while today it's more like 20-25! It's also possible that the older video needs more extensive (and expensive) restoration to bring to DVD.Do the math and divide the price by the number of episodes and THEN compare to the per-episode pricing of newer (and more poorly written) shows and you'll find that you are getting a pretty good value on these! If you value the product, just stop whining and pay the money!"
3,TV Series: 5 Stars; DVD 1:1 - 1 Star - Averages Out To 3,"SOSF was one of the best cop shows on TV and exemplified the 70s. Many of us who lived through that era and enjoyed the shows were salivating over the eventual (and LONG OVERDUE) DVD release. When I read an IMDB blog that Amazon had it on pre-order, I rushed to the site.I was thoroughly disappointed and disgusted that this DVD is PART ONE of Season One! Part One!!! And the price is what you'd expect to pay for a full season on most other TV series, except some like Wiseguy, whose distributors were clearly trying to bloodsuck money from the fans. Clearly, that is the case here, too: when a fan get the full Season One, he/she will pay double. I won't: I'll wait until an Amazon seller drops it down to half price and get it then.SHAME!!"
4,Seeing San Francisco 35 Years Ago worth the price of DVD,"First, I'm happy this tv show was even put on DVD. I'm sure the response to the first DVD will determine if any others are produced. Second, the quality of the video is really surprisingly good. Third, seeing San Francisco in 1972 is like time travel - worth the price of the DVD right there.This show wasn't produced on fake soundstages or in Los Angeles, as was McMillan and Wife. This was done all right here in San Francisco. As a current longtime resident of this city, I'm intrigued at how life was here back then.Karl Malden and Michael Douglas were a great team together and although this show was made following a simple forumula, they made the best of it. It isn't Masterpiece Theatre, but it does the job better than a lot of old cop shows."
2,Greedy Pricing & Broken Seasons - Sad!,I continue to REFUSE to purchase Season DVD sets broken into volumes! It's rediculous and GREEDY! The price will drop as they sit on the shelves!
1,NOOOOOO,"The fabric is wonderful, the stitching not so much. It's such a shame because I do love the material and weight of this comforter, but the stiching is crooked, and there are now holes so that I can see the stuffing inside... wonderful. I do not recommend this product, I was very unhappy with this. It basically looks years old within a week. RIDICULOUS!!"
1,"""You get what you pay for""","We purchased this comforter to replace our micro suede comforter that we had for 5+ years. What a disappointment. The seam running down the middle of the comforter does not line up - thus creating an appearance of two very crooked seams running parallel and/or crossing over each other. We kept the comforter because it was inexpensive and we had a duvet cover to slip it into. However, less than a year later the crooked seam running the length of comforter has opened. The worst quality. The old saying rings true, ""You get what you pay for""."
3,Would be perfect if....,"They included the CLASSIC song 'Every Generation' from 1980. It is hard to imagine a Ronnie Laws compilation without this awesome track, but if you want to obtain it, get 'Smooth Grooves-Jazzy Soul' VOL.3, and create a better Laws compilation CD. The 'Every Generation' CD is out of print!! Besides that, this is a nice Ronnie Laws sampler that features hits from the 'Pressure Sensitive' era, and there are some hits like 'Always There', 'Friends & Strangers', and others that also feature his sisters Debra & Eloise on vocals. I'd also recommend Debra Laws' 'Very Special' (1981) CD because Ronnie is a featured player on all tracks (he even sings on the title cut!!). All in all, the best of Ronnie Laws is 'nice', but should've been more comprehensive. Get a used copy!Peace, SD (of 'Chaka's World')"
2,Not The Best of Ronnie Laws!,"Though this CD compilation of his ""greatest"" has ""Always There"" and ""Friends and Strangers"", his finest hits were ""Every Generation"" and ""Very Special"" with is sister, Debra. Those key omissions make this CD less desireable. Blue Note Records should have worked harder to provide those tracks to his fans. This is a short changed CD."
5,Michael Crawford has the voice of an angel!,"I very highly recommend this album. I have been a fan of Michael Crawford's for many years. Michael has the voice of an angel and puts his entire heart and soul into every song that he sings. Michael sings each song with warmth, tenderness, and emotion. I'd give this album 1000 stars if I could. It has a variety of songs from his other albums. It's a truly beautiful and divine album."
1,Could be scary for some little ones,"This book scared the daylights out of my first grader. The author shows the baby hippo losing its mother during a tsunami and subsequently finding a new one. To make matters worse for some tender readers and those being read to, the ghostly outline of the lost mother hovers in the background at the end. However, sometimes bad things do happen, and for a parent who wants to introduce the concept of death or losing a parent in some way, this book could be helpful. As an everyday bedtime story though, it wouldn't be my choice. Could really cause worry in some children."
1,unbelievable,i can't believe someone dares publish a book like this.Few techniques with some commentary full of ortographic and sintactic mistakes. Worth less than 3 dollars.Truly unbelievable also someone gives it 5 stars...
2,me too..,"I must agree with ""a reader from Riga"" - although an interesting story, I was very disappointed with the level of English. It did indeed read like a high-school essay which is such a shame - the story of Aurora and Alfreds deserves better! I would have liked to recommend the book to non-Latvian friends but was embarrassed, due to the poor language. I did lend it to my mother, without divulging my thoughts, and having read it, she said the same thing."
2,sorry...,"In all due respect, (since the reviews are getting so personnal...) this might be an interesting story from an interesting lady... but the writing is horrible! It reads like a high-school essay, with very awckward sentences, corny emotional passages and failed attempts at high-literature. The story could have been good, but this book was not a pleasant read, no matter how interested I am in the history of Latvia during and after WWII. Sorry..."
2,"At times laughable, overall uneventful","Fairly well shot and sprinkled with comedic wit, this show is rather lacking in the areas of storyline and character development. Three friends riding the wave of partying and excitment formed by their up-and-coming actor friend destined to be the 'next big thing'. The premise was ok, but unfortunately nothing ever really seems to happen in these shows. The plot moves slowly, if at all, and when an opportunity arrives for the writers to create some real tension or excitment, they side-step it. It appears that the real premise for each episode is to dangle nice cars, attractive women, and countless cameos in front of the viewer so that he/she fills with desire for such a lucrative lifestyle. I'm all for that, but try to write a script in the process."
1,I Don't Get the Fascination,"I've tried to watch it, but I can't get through an episode. It's mindless tripe. This is the first and probably only HBO series I don't like, it feels like it's for adults who never quite got past their mtv stage and i guess there's nothing wrong with that...it's just not my thing. Maybe I'm missing something here, but I just don't understand why anyone would think this is a good show."
3,Fag?,"I'm only on Season 1 Episode 5 and they have used the word ""fag"" in 3 episodes. I find that offensive and tasteless! It's the 21st century already..."
2,Entourage,"I watched it when I first received it and while I enjoyed it enough to watch the whole thing, I can remember little about it.I have not spent any time regretting the money I paid for it."
2,"Good show, not worth buying","I had heard this was a good show & since I don't have HBO I bought it. The show was decent, not addicting like other shows. I don't think it was worth 30 bucks since there are only like 6 half hour episodes. If you are able to rent them or borrow them from someone I would suggest doing that instead."
5,Cool and Edgy,"If you haven't had a chance to see the HBO series, and you are not overly sensative invest some time to Entourage. Look beyond what might seem Hollywood glam to see how these characters are built. They have real depth with everyday insecurities we all endure. And then there is the money, women and other ""trappings"" of fame. This is truly entertaining."
4,Guilty pleasure of mine...,"I really like this show. My favorite characters are of course the gorgeous Vincent and the delightlful JP as th agent. I did not give it a five because some of the shows are slow but when it is good it's very good and hilariously funny. I really like Drama to. As some of the reviewers stated I never really thought of it as a male sex and the city, but that comparison is dead-on.At one point the only reason I kept HBO was due to Entourage and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Now that I can rent or purchase the two shows.I have canceled my subscription to them."
2,"Love the show, HATE HBO","I love Entourage, and my wife got me Seasons 1 - 5 for an anniversary present. So I started watching the First Season, and HBO ruined the DVDs. Before you can watch an episode, you have to watch 4 - 5 minutes of stupid HBO ads -- and you cannot fast forward through them.There are 4 episodes on Disc 1. So if you watched each episode separately, that means you have to sit through 16 - 20 minutes of annoying commercials.Come on. I bought the DVDs, don't make we regret paying you money HBO instead of finding the episodes on a torrent (which wouldn't have the lousy commercials)."
5,Incredible serie!,We are addicted to this serie.. it's awesome!Can't wait until the 2nd serie comes out!
5,Best damn show on TV!!!,"Plain and simple, this is as good as TV gets. I'm a HUGE Sopranos fan, but I am actually more addicted to this show than the Sopranos! The 2nd season is a little better than the 1st season, but it's still a great show.Only thing that sucks is that I can't just hit play, and start watching. You actually have to choose the episode you want to watch, and then hit play."
2,This is creativity?,"If the earth opened up and swallowed the young men portrayed in this series, the world would be better off. They strut. They preen. They boast. Their values are cars, houses, sexual conquests. They make decisions on what movies people will watch. They cannot utter a sentence without profanity.Why anyone would find this series entertaining is beyond me. The production values are good, but that's about all one can say for it."
4,Entourage: first season,This is a good product. It shipped fast. Although the dvd case was broke and one of the disks was scratched.
3,not for me,"Just not for me - sorry to give it low rating - but it's not about anything - it's good to dream about what it would be like to become famous. It's shot very well, high production quality, good acting, but boring story line.I gave it another star because it doesn't seem fair to give a low rating because of a boring story."
5,Great :),"I saw an episode of Entourage and wanted the whole season, but I didn't want to spend a lot. I was really excited to find this set, especially for the price! It arrived in the mail in the expected amount of time, and I got to watch it as soon as I got home. Yay! :)"
5,Entourage Season 1,"Received my product in great condition, on time. The price was equal to competitors. Satisfied with my service."
4,Good show,Was very impressed the the first season of Entourage. The only thing I found wrong with it is that it went so fast and was over and I want more... Season 2 please:)
1,Terrible Show,If I could I would give this show zero my brothers love it but I just think it is stupid.
1,Quite possibly the worst show on television.,"Unoriginal. Boring. Trite.If you enjoy MTV and all its wonderful programming, and Mark Wahlberg films, this is the show for you."
2,Entourage Season 1 DVD,"I originally purchased Season 1 on UMD for my PSP and watched it numerous times. Since I had no way to view my PSP on my TV, I decided to purchase the DVD set so I could share the experience with my friends. Low and behold the DVD set was woefully missing scenes in each episode to the point where I couldn't watch them. Does anyone know why that is? I mean they cut out some very funny scenes that made the episodes make more sense. Very disappointing"
5,An album to listen to when alone with someone you love.,"""So Tonight That I May See"" is an album of such feeling and texture, it is impossible to acurately describe it without having listen to it. If you want a rich melodic album, then by all means, buy this album. If you dont like to think while listening to music, do not buy this album. This album forces you to think and feel about what is being said, and what is being played. When you are alone at night, with the person of your dreams, put this on, and listen to it together. You may come away with a deeper understanding of how music can effect people emotionaly, and spirtually. Then again, I could be wrong, its only my opinion. =)"
2,Maybe I'm missing something....,"There seems to be a lot of glowing reviews for this CD. I guess maybe I just don't get it. I bought this CD (used, thank goodness) because I really like the song ""Fade into You"", always have. I know I shouldn't have expected the rest of the album to sound the same, but I confess, I did expect it to at least sound similar. I have tried time and time again to listen to this CD in its entirety, but I just can't. The only time it makes it off the shelf is when I want to hear the one song. I think it's the fact that she just seems to talk through the music.I almost feel guilty slamming the CD. A lot of people really seem to get it. I gave it two stars because of ""Fade into You"", if I hadn't liked that song I probably would have given it one, or better yet, not reviewed it at all."
2,More of the same,"Mazzy Star have their schtick down, don't they?If you liked their previous stuff, well then, have another helping of melancholia, world-weariness, simple chord changes, and mostly sloooow beats.It's music to slit your wrists by. Or at least would be if it didn't lull you to sleep first."
4,Good Sound,"this album is pretty good. i don't have any of her other cd's, but if you like your ears listening to a fuzzy, strung out on heroin sound, this is the album of all album's to get."
2,The most boring cd ever?,"I hate to be a spoilsport, but I just got done with my upteenth attempt at listening to this cd without thinking of everything else. Mazzy Star's first album, ""She Hangs Brightly"", is a true masterpiece, definitely on my Top 10 Best '90's Albums list. But this...after 'Fade Into You' (an awesome track), the songs just become an endlessly monotonous drone. It is easily the most boring and listless album that I have ever heard. It's not bad, it's just boring. I can't even recall one single moment of energy. It may be your cup of tea, but it's not mine."
3,Dissapointed,I bought this after hearing 'Into Dust' on 666 Park Avenue and reading the reviews on here. I listened to the whole collection and it's just not my sort of thing. Some of it was rather unpleasant.
5,Perfect Gift,"Mazzy Star is one of my favorite bands from the '90's. I wanted to share them with a good friend who has a huge vinyl collection, and Amazon really came through. The album arrived in perfect condition, and ended up being a great gift for my friend."
4,Good cd,"The first song on the album is worth the purchase price alone..Great Cd if you want to just relax and chill....It lost one star because sopme of the songs just sound to hippyish and take away from the relaxing vibe and just get annoying.........but like I said....get some wine, buy your girl a gift and put track one on repeat.....Guaranteed sex ;)"
5,ONE OF MOST FINEST MUSICAL WORKS IN THE WORLD,"EVERY PIECE OF WORK DONE ON THIS CD IS INCREDIBLLY FABULOUS. AND SONGS LIKE ""FADE INTO YOU"" AND ""FIVE STRING SERENATE"" GO BEYOND THIS WORLD."
4,"Good but not great. (For great, see Among My Swan.)","This is a good release with good songs... some of them are very skilled indeed and Hope Sandoval's voice truly seductive and beautiful.But this disc just doesn't reach down into me like Among My Swan does. When I listen to Among My Swan, I cry. When I listen to So Tonight That I Might See, I just think ""Wow, what great music!""It's still a must-own, however. Tracks like Fade Into You, Five String Serenade and Into Dust are amazing compared to the nonsense that's on radio these days. Even good-but-not-great Mazzy Star is good enough to bring it home, on the right day..."
3,"Not as Good as ""Among My Swan""","""So Tonight that I Might See,"" contains Mazzy Star's breakthrough single ""Fade Into You."" Nevertheless, it doesn't hold up to ""Among My Swan,"" the excellent album that was released after it. The problem mostly lies in the songwriting. After ""Fade,"" the album becomes very uneven, hitting other high points like ""Five String Serenade,"" ""Bells Ring"" and ""Into Dust"" but also foundering with clunkers like ""Mary of Silence"" and the title track. Hope Sandoval's remarkable voice, so haunting on the best material, sounds strained and remote on the lesser tracks.Overall, an uneven album that nevertheless put Mazzy Star and unique singer Hope Sandoval on the map."
5,brooding power,"this is an awesome cd!I'd compare hope sandoval(mazzy star's singer)to julee cruise or kim gordon(at times),and the music is definatly reminicent of the first two julee cruise albums.it has a subtle ""misting"" effect that sweeps through you and makes you feel what she feels.my favorite track is the one with the slide guitar on it.fans of dark tones and affectionate vocals should eat this right up!"
3,I can't finish the whole CD,I bought this CD for one song only. If you liked Fade into You so much and were willing to pay the price then buy it.The rest of the CD like another reviewer said was an acquired taste. I couldn't make myself to listen through the entire CD.
2,The CD never came!,"I received notice that the CD was not in stock, but my money was refunded. It's just disappointing to think you've won a bid and then find out that they didn't have the CD in stock to begin with. It'd be nice if people not post something if they can't provide it."
1,can someone PLEASE explain the appeal?,"On the advice of two trusted friends with otherwise good taste in music, I got this cd, and folks, it's terrible. I should've seen it coming from a mile off. A singer named Hope Sandoval, in a group called Mazzy Star, with an album titled <So Tonight That I Might See>... It has all the making of one bloated, pretentious, alternative phenomenon that proves everybody eventually gets their fifteen minutes, regardless of whether or not they deserve it. This album is slow and boring, with little or no variation between songs. The lyrics are uninspired and reminiscent of the bad townie poetry written by people who wear too much black. Your money would be better spent on sedatives; you'll get the same effect without feeling cheated."
1,Fade Into You we know is a suicide note,"However, I did hear some more of this back in my days of working at a trucking company, and I would go to this corner store to buy stuff for the people, and this 17 year old girl who was called ""Flower"" would play this, and now I think she's near 30. I know if you wanted to paralyze me, and make me docile as a pussycat, or make me curl up in a fetal position is to play ""Fade Into You"". I remember hearing this after May 27th, and after my car accidents, and I just fell apart. The slide guitar, the soft singing, and the slow movement it just made me think of girls/women laughing at me, and this is from where I know that a couple of girls had stood me up a couple of times, and it just reminded me of this. The rest is just as bad."
5,Spectacular,This is one of my favorite C.D.s of all time. It's very mellow and easy to listen to anytime. Hope's eccentric voice blends perfectly with the rest of the music.I would definately recomend it!
4,HAUNTING,"I first heard the song FADE INTO YOU on a jukebox in a hip coffee shop. I immediately ran out and bought the CD. I have to admit, I only really like two songs on it:FADE and FIVE STRING SERENADE. The others are all depressing and unpleasant sounding. But the two songs I do like are so haunting and beautiful that they were worth the price of the whole album."
3,Mood Music,"The perfect album to doze off to sleep to, particularly after a long, stressful day. Very sexy in a dark sort of way. Not the type of album that I want to listen to on a regular basis, however. I'm amazed at how people throw around five stars on this sight."
1,BAD PRESSING great album,"I had high expectations for the Mazzy Star reissues on vinyl, unfortunately the pressing is terrible. Sound quality is noisy with distracting pops even skips here and there. Usually the Plain label does decent reissues, they dropped the ball here."
1,Iceless wine cooler,This item is advertised as 5.5 x 5.5 x 9. The top opening inside diameter is 3 15/16 and outisde diameter 4 3/8.Not as advertised and cannot hold larger bottles that would fit if the advertised dimensions were correct.
4,Best sunscreen I've had,"Having developed brown patches on my face from a Neutrogena dry-touch sunscreen, I decided to do some research and buy skin-friendly and environment friendly product. Vanicream SPF 35 did a great job in protecting my fair complexion during a week of hiking in sunny weather high up the foothills of Mt.Rainier, WA. I still tanned slowly over time in a glowing smooth fasion. i would highly recommend this sunscreen."
3,Not the solution I was hoping for,"Based on my dermatologist's recommendation, I purchased Vanicream Sport with the hopes it would allow me to wear sunblock without making my face break out. While it seems to work great for other reviewers, I didn't have the same luck. My face still broke out after I used it, about the same as if I used Eucerin or Neutrogena. It didn't cause a burning, stinging sensation like chemical sunblocks, but it didn't wash away cleanly and I ended up with pimples from that. Maybe I should have tried the version that is not water-proof, but reviewers said it was too greasy, so I went with the ""sport"" version.I would say it's still worth a try to anyone with problem skin, but it may not work for everyone."
5,Love it,"The only thing I do not like about this sunscreen is applying it. It is as thick as toothpaste. But, it works SOOO much better than other sunscreens I have tried, and it stays on much longer. No need to apply every 2 hours like the over the counter stuff. It is worth the extra time it takes to apply it!"
1,Not worth it - a real waste of time and money,This book was a complete waste of time and at the end of it I didn't feel like I knew even a small fraction of what interdev was about. All the book did was waste my time.
1,This book is difficult to search and unhelpful,"I have used many books to help me learn and reference ASP and this one has by far been the worst. I would not even waste the time to order it. I am usually not this vocal about a bad book, but I would hate for others to waste their time trying to use this book as a Visual Interdev reference."
2,Good beginners book but authors gave short-shift to DTC's.,Working through the first few chapters was useful to get into Visual InterDev from a beginner's perspective. I skipped around once I got to the long section on FrontPage. The coverage of Design-Time controls is disappointing and lacks the in-depth detail that was present in the early chapters of this book. I used it with Visual InterDev from the Ground Up and the two compliment each other fairly well.
1,Save your money on this one.,"This book is not a Bible at all. It's a introduction for beginners to Visual Interdev at best. It hardly talked anything about Scripting Object Model or Design-Time Controls. Most other Interdev 6.0 books at least attempted on these topics. This book simply avoided these topics. In that sense it's merely teaching people to use Interdev 6.0 like Interdev 1.0, even beginners should probably avoid this one."
1,Do not buy this book.,"I have learned more about InterDev from an article in Web Tech magazine (distributed freely)than this 700 page book. The book goes blaa blaa wala wala about nothing important. All I need to know is how to create databases on sql, web projects and connect the two, other Db connectivity and the tricks to present Db output as I like. A section for trouble shooting would showoff the writers expertise, but may not for $49. Buy this book if you want to learn FrontPage, you'll find about 150 pages packed with info about FrontPage. Too bad the writer forgot he was writing for InterDev."
2,NEEDS AN UPDATE!!!!!,"IMO the book is average at best.It was obviously written based on an early beta version of the product. Examples, explanations and screen shots often did not match the product. Worse still some of the example code in the book is different than that on the CD.I do not have a problem with early release books provided the publishers and authors provide on-line updates. Mansfield and Revette have failed to do so according to the IDG site.Better to wait for a newer title."
2,Good for the beginner or before you have serious problems,"Interesting book though several things keep it from earning more stars.Apparently the book was last updated in 1993. So, comparisons using more modern inverters, 400+ Amp alternators, newer wind machines/solar cells are not compared.Personally, I am more interested in the ground up construction of a marine electrical system. The book deals well with the repair and maintenance of an existing one, as well as small projects. The book is more suited to an existing boat owner rather than a builder.Lastly, explanations go from basic to advanced with little time spent in between. Though this isn't a major problem.My recommendation?.. If you need serious help with your boats electrical system.. keep shopping.. But, if you have minor problems, wish to understand the systems better or wish to prevent problems by all means buy this book.."
5,"""At last we shall have revenge!""","This is an ideal Star Wars book. It is also is the best of the Star Wars journals! But you can't expect anything less from Jude Watson, can you? Anyways, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to fans of SW villains or Darth Maul (COUGH! me!).This book does have a bit of violence & fighting in it, so only buy it if you can handle it! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH ALL OF YOU!"
3,Darth Maul Journal,"I read this book and it's good. It shows you the history of Darth Maul and his perpective of the war.it's perfect for any Star Wars fan. One problem is if you want to see Episode 1 iteslf through Darth Maul's view, this isn't quite that it is almost all about the past."
2,Unfullfilled,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but it has left an empty void. The book itself was printed on cheap paper, and not bound well. The book did not want to open fully, making it hard to read with one hand.As for the story...It was a nice little yarn, but it was very short, and I read it in just a couple of hours. The book is best read when got at the library for free. That or reduce the price to around a dollar."
4,revenge and triumph of darth maul,"I am Darth Maul, dark lord of the Sith and apprentice of Darth Sidious and slayer of the Jedi. I am not only Master Sidious' instrument but also the instrument of Sith's revenge against Jedi.Now Jude Watson will pay for daring to steal my private journal and take all credit for it. She will pay a thousand times for discrediting me as a flawed character who was defeated by a puny Jedi.Always the dark side will prevail. Not even being cut in half may get rid of me. When i return, the galaxy will tremble."
2,Sooooo Skimpy,"This was a good book, but Darth Maul's character is souped up. This book is a (very) thin reanactment of the movie giving Darth Maul's evil perspectives. An easy read. Darh Maul tells his story in such a way that it makes you pitty and hate him at the same time which gets you very frusterated. I prefer Watsons Jedi Apprentice seris."
3,darth who?,"over all i was disappointed with this star wars journaleven though i enjoy the concept - i highly recommend the otherson han, leia, luke, anakin, and amidala; its a shame that they did not do one for young obi-wan or qui-gon!i echo concerns of anyone who has young kids, because by naturemaul is a dark character... i didnt like using any stars because i'm not really sure how to rate this. it difficult to tell what age group they're trying to write for here. it had strong detail on mauls training but was very weak on who maul was -i realize his role as warrior(soldier?)is a big part of his lifebut that doesnt tell me anything about his personality, every villian, no matter how strict, has one. i think the writer spent too much time keeping him mysterious.a journal or diary does just the opposite, its where a personreveals secrets - i guess i just feel the writer had a chance to do alot more with who maul was instead of dazzling us with his abilities..."
3,Not so great,"I didn't get much out of Darth Maul's journal. It seemed to me that this journal made him out to be a big hypocrite, as well as an arrogant fool. There were a few tantalizing glimpses at his past, but not enough to appease my curiosity about him, only enough to make me want more. The stuff that I wanted to know, (how he tracked the jedi) is left undisclosed, while the author brings him into stupid battles with Togorian pirates and Tusken raiders, stuff that shouldn't have happened. I think that this book was rather a waste of money, and I'd recomend not buying it."
3,m review,this book was pretty good but i thoght it could be better.IT WAS ABOUT DARTH MAUL OUTSIDE THE STORY AND IN AS WELL ONE DAY DARTH MAUL WAS ON HI WAY TO A PLANET CALLED TATOOINE TO KILL A JEDI BUT WAS AMBUSHED BY PIRATES BUT HE SLAUGHTERED THEM ALL THEN HE CONTINED ON TO TATOOINE THEN HE FOUND THE JEDI BUT THE JEDI ESCAPED TO FIND OUT MORE READ THIS BOOK...
5,Stitt's It!!,"This set was recorded in February 1954 at the Hi-Hat Club in Boston. He often traveled and worked with a local rhythm section. This was such a situation. I would point out that this release for some inexplicable reason omits three tunes from the Fresh Sound (1002) version of the evening. A nice tenor solo on Body And Soul as well as a swinging baritone solo on Baritone Blues and a good alto solo on How High The Moon. Nevertheless this is Sonny Stitt at his peak. Most of the tenor solos, to me, are somewhat perfunctory for Stitt with the exception of Indiana. The alto solos are dynamite: Sweet Georgia Brown,I'm In The Mood For Love,If I Should Lose You, Wigwam and My Melancholy Baby. The tune Tri-Horn Blooz is the best. He plays baritone, tenor and alto. Absolutely top notch. He is fresh and at the top of his game. Few players could have competed with Sonny Stitt on that momentous evening."
4,Wonderful for relatives of autistic children,"This is a terrific book! It helped my in-laws understand my son better. They had thought autism was as it is in TV movies - silent, non-responsive, unreachable children. Their grandson certainly wasn't like that, he got good grades, so he wasn't autistic. Now they realize that when I say my son is autistic I'm not insulting his intelligence, but refering to the way his mind works."
2,A mixed review,"I applaud the author for her attempts at telling a story through the eyes and words of her son. The concept is correct, the method is not. The story rambles, often jumping from topic to topic. The ""handwritten"" font is creative, but actually hard to read. It could have been so much more effective to have this book written by someone with more legible printing. The photos are at times compelling, but others are too obscure for children to interpret. I bought this book for my seven-year-old son, to help him understand my four-year-old autistic son. There were some helpful thoughts, but this book seemed to create more confusion and questions for him."
1,A Waste of Time,"This could have been much better. I admire parents who use their experiences to write stories to help us learn about children with disabilities. However, in this case it seems like it was only done to make a buck. More thought should go into a book than what appears to have happened here."
1,Buyer Beware! These are not the original recordings!,"I had been looking for a CD with the song Lyin' To Myself and was so excited to order this, then I get the CD and it's some rerecording that I do not like at all."
4,David still pleases!,"I bought this CD mostly for curiosity sake. As we all know, many ""teen idols"" are just that and upon listening to them again, (when you are past the ""heart-throb"" stage), you wonder what you thought was so wonderful. I was pleased to know that David still sings (and looks) great and uses his vocals for such a wide range of music/songs. My husband, who was never a fan, per se, enjoys the CD as much as I do. If you liked David then, you love him now. If you had no opinion before, give it a try...It's nice to know a ""teen idol"" can surpass the test of time!"
2,Not one for old fans,"If I had known how bad this album was going to be I would never have wasted my money. When I heard it I was quite upset, this was not the famous Cassidy voice I remember, the re-mixes are awful. I could feel myself blushing with embarrasment for him. I was a big fan of Davids when I was younger even going to concerts here in England in the 70`s and all I wanted when I bought this cd was to replace my old scratched records. Who do I have to see to get my money back.These mixes make him sound like an old pub singer trying to recreate his past, even bad kareoke is not this bad.Sorry David this album is a definate no-no. Iwould not inflict this cd on a deaf man."
5,David's best ever!,"I have always loved David Cassidy, and just recently I got to see him in concert when he came to my town of Fairfield, CA in October of 2003. Every song that is on his Then and Now cd he sang at the concert. I immediately went to the store the next day and bought this cd and haven't stopped playing it yet. The songs on this cd range from his early ""Partridge Family"" days to now. His voice is just as soulful and bluesy as it has always been. I recommend you buy this cd if you really love to listen to David Cassidy, whether it is for the early songs or for his later ones. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"
1,"I'm a huge fan of David Cassidy, but this CD is still awful!","I'm truly a huge fan of David Cassidy's incredible voice...and this from an athletic straight guy. :)However, I urge everyone to leave this CD on the shelf and instead buy the original Partridge Family and David Cassidy albums instead; Cherish, Rock Me Baby, et al.With the exception of a duet on ""Could It Be Forever,"" this album proves that David was wonderful when produced by Wes Farrell and Bruce Johnston in the 70's...but doesn't quite know what to do with his voice/song selections when left on his own."
3,. . . A Good Effort . . .,"but could be better! How about including ""Sing Me,"" ""Mae,"" ""I Am A Clown,"" ""Romance,"" ""Walking In The Rain,"" ""Leave Myself A Little Time,"" ""As Long As There's You"" on the next go around, David?"
1,Don't buy this,"Well, I thought one black man would be able to understand black women - but I was wrong. The author even wrote to white women and said that they could be a social conscience for the white race which they can not."
1,Do not purchase!,"If I could give this book a rate of 0, I would easily do so. I am a woman, and I understand that women are not equal to men in present time. I can also sympathize with Black Women, that it is difficult to compete with other members of society in this day and age. However, Michael Porter does a terrible job defending this as well as educating his readers on the subject. Much of the book is based on his own opinion which does not hold up very well in my mind. He resents White males in this population and his hatred towards Whites basically plays out on every page in this poor, poor book. Take my word, do not purchase this book, you will be displeased, angry and ultimately embarrassed for this man upon completion."
2,Not too good,"Not very practical appetizer recipes. The recipes just don't look very good to me.Instead, buy the Williams Sonoma ""Hors D'oeuvre"" by Binns."
3,Not the best,Not a bad little book for maybe the beginner cook or home chef. Would not consider it for the home entertainer.
1,"Product is Ok, But Product leaks and tapes pop off.",This product was good back in 2008 now it's not worth anything to keep on wearing. Problem is that the brief leaks overnight unless I use a booster pad from select. The tapes keep on popping off and you need booster pads to make it more absorbent. I do not recommend these to anyone with heavy to complete loss of bladder control.
4,Exquisite classical piece.,"This CD is a very well-done and thoughtful collection of classical pieces by French composers (Faure, Boulanger, Ravel and Poulenc). Some well-known and other, more eclectic and not-so-well-known; all played extremely well by these two very talented ladies."
4,Photos of Eloise,"Wonderful pictures of the institution and medical center, and of the past. Interesting read for those who have that fascination with mental institutions and their history."
1,Don't buy it....Larry is not a legend.,This book is another way to get Larry some money because he won't be playing ball next year....he needs his money so he is calling on his sheep to help him.
4,Traffic,This book is very impotant especially for countries which have low level of traffic densities. They will repeat the experiance of the developed country - and using this type of books can avoid some of their mistakes in the proccess of traffic planning
2,Too many typos!,"Although the book is indeed big and has tons of photos and many interesting things in it, I am distressed that the author apparently never took any time to either proof read his own work or get someone else to do so. It seems that you cannot turn a page without coming across one typo or error after another.An example that sticks in my mind: the basis for an accident is called the ""root"" cause, not the ""route"" cause! Numerous examples abound of incomplete sentances, or sentances cut off or missing information mid-sentance. This makes it hard to place faith in the remainder of the book's information.As I said, still an interesting book, but for a guy who claims (on the dust jacket) to be a noted author for other venues, I would have thought that the quality would be better.Worth buying. . .probably. Worth quoting as a factual basis for further research, not likely."
3,So So,"I was expecting more Bossa Nova, and instead I got 80's wanna be jazz music. If your into that then you will like this CD. Otherwise I would look elsewhere."
4,Interesting Resource,"Very good resource for those interested in penology or criminology. This book offers much to think about, as well as being a citable source."
2,Overdosed,"This was really extreme experience for me.I'm 190 lb. After one pill I was red and swollen during 2 or 3 hours and then scratched myself several days like if I was bitten by thousand mosquitoes. I thrown it away next day.This was my real experience, now after reading all comments I'm thinking that maybe I was wrong taking this high dose.May be 200 mg I should try lower dose because 1000 mg is for ""professionals"".BUT again I'm not trying to advertise other products - some people can have really extreme experience with this product."
5,amazing baby book,"this book is practically our 7-month-old's security blanket. She loves when we read it to her, she loves touching and playing with it. It's wonderful. And we think it's cute too which also helps."
5,Cute book great for my 11 month old!,"My daughter loves this book! she loves the colors and the different textures, she's 11 months old and I will sit with her and read it to her, lots of pictures, and different things for her to touch and experience! well worth it!"
4,We love this series of books,"It's very simple. A little mouse runs around trying to find his monster, each monster is wrong for some touchy-feely reason.Very striking, simple pictures, very easy text for little babies and toddlers. Any child is capable of sitting through this one!I do find that two of the pages stick together, probably because of the texture used on the paws (""bumpy""), and I am continually disappointed that the rough horns aren't very.But overall, it's a great book in a great series."
3,"Good, but not quite up to Immigrant's Saga.","I have been a fan of Fast's Immigrants Saga since I read the first book. Imagine my suprise when I saw a new book to a series that I had thought had been concluded. I cannot say that this is as good as the Immigrants series has been, but it isn't terrible. It was mostly a trip down Barbara Lavette's memory lane. This book mostly made me decide to re-read and try to find copies of the books that lead up to this one. It does seem that Mr. Fast got tired while writing the story and decided that he was done, so stopped by giving Barbara cancer. I will read this book again, and I do recommend it to any fan of Fasts Immigrants saga, just to take the walk though the Lavette's and Levy's interesting lives."
3,Bye Barbara,"As a third generation Italian-American who lives in San Francisco, I fell in love with the Immigrant series when I read it in high school years ago. Upon hearing that this last book in the series had been published, I eagerly reread all the previous books to prepare myself for ""An Independent Woman."" Unfortunately, I have a good memory so the inaccuracies and editing mistakes took some of the enjoyment off of what in all was an good experience. (My favorite mistake was Joanna and Steve Cassala's return from the dead.) Putting this aside though, I loved getting immersed in the Lavette-Levy tale again, and cried as it ended. I wish that Barbara had lived to go on more adventures - that she wasn't struck down in her prime - but then again that is how life works sometimes. Even though, this wasn't the end I had envisioned for the Immigrant series, I am happy that I read it, and would encourage any fan to buy it."
2,Very disappointing...,"I was totally surprised when I saw ""An Independent Woman"" in the bookstores, and also excited. I have loved ""The Immigrant"" series of books since they first started, and have read them over & over again. The characters have always been well-written and highly believable. Sadly, I do not feel that I will be re-reading this book anytime soon and cannot recommend it to those who have read the series. I felt that this was not in the same caliber as the other 5. The thing that I was most disappointed in: People that had died 2 books earlier were now alive (one glaring example: Stephan Cassala's wife Joanna). It was almost as if someone else wrote the book instead of Mr. Fast. Did the editors of this book ever read the first 5? If so, wouldn't they have checked for errors in chronology/family history/content?"
2,Poor ending,"I have read the six books in a row and it's true it has a lot of mistakes. The book seems to have been written by someone different from Howard Fast. It's a pity that the saga ends like this, because the five previous books were fantastic."
2,A First Draft.,"I glanced over the array of new books and saw Howard Fast's Independent Woman. His entire series have been exciting, wonderful. Didn't think he would write another. I read everything he wrote and was always entranced with his San Francisco sagas. And here was yet another to take the story further. He had done it again. Except he hasn't. Sad, but this novel is a pale reflection of his past literary achievements and should have been left unpublished until he had a chance to reconsider, to write a finished draft."
3,Bought this book on sale,"and I am glad I did not pay full price for it. It was an ok book. I have never read any of Howard Fast's books before and I probably won't bother with any others.I felt that the book was rambley and disjointed. I did like the fact that the author made it easy to read this book without reading the others in the series.I also liked reading about Jerusalem, wine, and Unitarianism. These were wonderfully researched and discussed and it was good to learn new things and explore new ideas, especially in relation to faith and God.In books that I really enjoy, the characters are alive, I feel close to them and am sorry when the story comes to a close. I did not have this feeling at the end of ""An Independent Woman."" The end was sad, but I never felt that I really knew Barbara or her family and, therefore, I felt removed from the events.It is a good and interesting story, but I was not able to warm to the characters."
2,No shoulder strap....................,"This bag is well made, and includes strong handles, and attachment ringsfor a shoulder strap....but the shoulder strap is not supplied.Sort of like selling an egg with-out the shell.For the cost, there should be one supplied.All my horn cases have straps for a good reason, so should this music bag.Bummer..........."
5,This camera was buried in the snow and still worked!,I just need to rave about this camera. I loved it from day one it is easy to use and has so many options. It is also a great price. The thing that has completely shocked me and amazed me is that my camera was accidently taken outside and left outside by a younger sibling of mine and it still works. He thought it would be funny to bury it in the snow this past winter. I had on clue where it was it sat outside buried in snow for at least a week and then when I finally found it the snow had all melted so it went through a lot. Never in my dreams did I think that this camera would still work. I took out the batteries replaced them with fresh batteries and took out the memory card and replaced it with the same memory card. Hit the on switch and it turned on! I've been using it ever since with absolutely no problems. So if you want a camera that will take a beating with lots of options and that is easy to use this is the one for you!
2,Used to be great.,I've had this camera for almost 2 years now. All of a sudden it has the black screen LCD and is useless. It's not on the recall list like many other Cybershots for this problem. Sony will fix it for 181.00 plus. Not worth it. This will be my very last Sony camera.
1,poor product worse support,"sony sell broken camera in new box. when request for repair, they said the camera is supposed to have scratches and loose lense."
4,4 stars -- but - - -,"As of November 2009, I have owned this camera for several years and I am -- well, I WAS -- very happy with it. About two months ago, it started eating batteries. I install fully-charged batteries and within 24 hours, with the camera turned off and not in use, the batteries are dead. I've tried several different sets of batteries with the same result. Can't figure out the problem and I don't want to send it back so Sony as I'm certain it would cost more to repair than a new one. In fact, I think I'll buy a new or used one."
3,Good for a few years,"I received my Sony DSC-P93A roughly 5 years ago, after my previous Sony Cybershot of a former model, was stolen. Over the past 5 years, until recent months, this has been a great starter camera for me. Other than not being sufficient for my needs anymore (dislike the lack of optical zoom, adjusts poorly in some lighting conditions, short flash range), my only complaint now is that it seems to want to misread battery life. I have always taken care of my camera, so I'm not sure how to explain the why, but within the past 6 months it will shut down in picture-taking modes, when there is still enough battery power. If it doesn't shut down after attempting to take a picture, it will turn on when powered on, the lens will extend, then the camera will die. I have attempted recharging the batteries, changing the batteries altogether, and every time whichever batteries are in, as soon as they are 50% exhausted, the camera fails, which was really frustrating on my honeymoon."
3,resolution only 72,"help ... the book says nothing about this:I set my cybershot to the fine, and the 5m setting (largest) but when i go in to photoshop to ""play"" with my images it shows me a very large image 35"" x 27"" but only a resolution of 72; i see jagged edges that i think i should not see with a 5.1 megapixel camera.when i ""resample"" the image and lower size to 8"" x 10"" the resolution goes up but the image stays the same.how do i take a high rez image (300 dpi)not just a large image?"
5,AN EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR A PERFECT CAMERA!!!,"It's my first Digital camera, and I must say, ""It's perfect & worth every penny!""With its 5.1 MP Sony lens, the photo quality is amazing! Crisp, Sharp, Colorful and very detailed.I have to say, it works better than some CANON models! I took a photo of a same stationary subject with both cameras. I found out that the SONY's output was better than the CANON's. So I went for Sony.The camera has various features to enjoy including Video recording and OPTICAL/DIGITAL Zoom.Well done SONY! :)"
1,Worst camera ever,"I bought this camera a couple of years ago in amazon, and it work fine for about five months. After that, it didn't turn on, or it worked for a while and then turned off when you took the picture, leaving the lens outside. Too bad I couln't return it, but it was definitely a waste of money. Don't even bother.Strange to find a sony product this bad."
2,Rabid compression of images damages overall value,"There's no question the DSC-P93 is a great value. It is probably one of the lowest priced 5MP rated cameras. It is loaded with features and gives the user the capability to manually control more settings that most of its competitors, but it does not give the user the ability to capture uncompressed, RAW, or otherwise loss-less image formats such as GIF.This would be less of a problem if there was a way to turn up the quality of the jpegs that it produces, but there isn't. So if you are taking photos that include human hair or of a bird the hair and the feathers are captured with disappointing lack of definition. Fine for snapshots of your kids birthday party though. If I had it to do over I'd have purchased a different camera."
4,Beginner's Review,"This review is specifically written to contradict the review for beginners saying you must read the entire manual to use it or get horrible pictures.I don't know much about photography, but use this camera often at college (I take a few about a hundred a month). Only 6 months later did I finally crack out the manual b/c I wanted to learn about the more advanced features.For non-beginners, you might have to crack the manual before using (?) because you know about different features, but not a beginner."
3,get Risotto first!,"I am not really a fan of this kind of music. Most of techno, in my humble opinion, is incredibly annoying and repetitive. Still, I more or less like the first 8 songs on this album (about an hour worth of music). The rest seems to drag on and on. All in all, it is far from bad, but in many ways it does not come close to Risotto (which, by the way, was not that great to begin with). For truly amazing techno music I recommend Juno Reactor's Bible of Dreams or their second album, Jouney to the Infinite. Those 2 albums are million times better than some of the better known albums like The Prodigy's Fat of the Land (which, i think, is way overrated), Underworld's Beacup Fish (total trash), or any of the Orbital albums ( also way overrated)."
5,Simple but elegant!,"I heard rissoto first, and became completely obsessed with it... Fluke is just an amazing band, like Underworld, but different... Anyways, Six Wheels on my Wagon is definitely a more minmalistic album, in my opinion, or at least, a less varied album... the songs retain a consistent mellow theme through the whole album... not like the gritty peaks and sleepy valleys of Rissoto.. i love both of them, they're both awesome."
3,"Its OK, not ""great""..","I was expecting something alot better, based on all the glowing reviews of this CD, but ""Six Wheels.."" is only mediocre. Technically it is very palatable but this CD is missing all the imagination and musical flair that is so obviously present in ""Risotto"".Parts of it are pretty boring, to tell the truth. Tracks like ""Slid"" and ""Astrosapiens"" come close to being inspired but they don't quite make it. That's the way I feel about the whole CD."
3,it was so-so,"this movie didn't impress me. Deborah's book,""Touching From a Distance"" was much better. i'd wish i had simply rented instead of purchasing the film."
4,Excellent composition,"Sam Riley's performance definately made this movie. He is entirely convincing as Ian Curtis. The atmosphere, mood, and composition is also dead on, creating a wonderful and moving look at the early post-punk movement. I find myself agreeing with other reviewers who say that the movie could have been better...though I'm not sure what that would entail. There is, however, a lot of emotional subtley I think, and in the places where people claim that the movie ""drags on"", I think there is a virtue in being inexplicit about the character's struggle. I agree that this struggle could have been cut shorter, but I think the way in which the events leading up to Ian's suicide ""drag on"" somehow echoes the very appeal of Joy Division's music. It's dark and brooding, and it maintains the distance that is so central to Ian's tragedy."
2,Where is the motivation?,"As a longtime Joy Division fan, I approached this film with trepidation. Knowing that Anton Corbijn is a huge JD fan eased my concerns, but the film is a bit of a mess. Yes, it looks good and the black and white photography plays to Corbijns strengths, but I kept saying to myself ""If I didn't already know this story (and why is is so monumentally important) why would I care about it?"" I could not identify what was motivating the characters in the movie and I think most people would have a difficult time generating much empathy for Ian. You're better off getting the recently released Joy Division documentary, which is very well done."
3,ok...it was more for my husband than me,"this movie was okay...my husband liked it, but hes really into the band so it was probably better for him than me."
3,CONTROL DVD,"Great movie, expressing beautifully the bleak urban landscape of Ian Curtis's life, and his vulnerability as a person. Bummer that the dialogue isn't quite synched to the video."
4,Very good film,"I watched the movie only, none of the extras. Although it seemed a bit drawn out in certain parts, an overall very good movie about Ian Curtis and the late 70's. I will end up purchasing the dvd for the extras."
4,Good movie,"I have been a huge Joy Division fan since I first discovered them in 1990. I was a freshman in college and my neighbor in the dorm room next to me had it playing. I had been a big New Order fan and somehow was totally in the dark about their link with Joy Division. Since then, I have tried to read and watch everything I could get my hands on about JD. This movie was very interesting and enlightening. Every JD/NW fan should watch it. I highly recommend it."
4,Interesting Portrait of a Musician Who Commits Suicide,"Ian Curtis is the lead singer of Joy Division, a group which is anything but joyful. I always enjoyed the song, Love Will Tear Us Apart, even though other songs don't really reach me and move me very much. This movie is the story of Ian's short life before he committed suicide. For me, who knew little about the person or the group, I found the story at the beginning confusing and wasn't hooked on the music and the supposed greatness of it. None of the characters appear that likable though after awhile I grew a bit interested in the story and the filmmaking. In the end, I liked the movie enough to give it 4 stars but didn't feel any attachment with the group or Ian Curtis. Samantha Morton is most welcome as a familiar face in a sea of strangers. She plays Ian's wife who finds his body."
4,A well balanced tribute,"Control is the movie version of the book Touching from a Distance: Ian Curtis and Joy Division by Deborah Curtis. Although the movie is a kinder portrayal of the life of Ian Curtis, it succeeds in showing him as a cruel and dark person. One understands that it is from these depths that the innovation and art of the music of Joy Division comes from, yet this was no excuse for the way that he treated those who loved him. In fact, Control is more a love story than a musical tribute to Joy Division. The film contained the correct balance of dramatic and musical effect. The starkness of the black and white filming helped add to this effect. It is also useful that a lack of hero worship is given to Ian, unlike the life of many of his fallen musical sole mates. This helps one admire the music of Joy Division for what it is rather than who created it."
5,Recommended,"Sam Riley and the rest deliver an amazing performance. Sam Riley's portrayal of Ian Curtis is great.The entire film is in black and white--this compliments Joy Division's imagery, and it enhances the tone of the film.It's one of the best biopics I've seen. Even if you don't listen to Joy Division or like their music, I think that you'll find something to appreciate about this film.The music comes in at all the right moments, and it adds to the atmosphere and the plot.Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the bonus features do add to the film."
3,Good production. Slacker subject.,"The movie technically is very good. My dismay with the subject material, however, grew throughout the film to dim my impression of the whole movie. I was looking for redeeming qualities in Ian Curtis but did not find many to speak of. He was a good musician, but a lousy, amoral husband and father. I have heard the music of Joy Division, but I am less impressed today."
4,the life and death of yet another British rocker,Joy Division is a British working class rock band of the late 70'sthat have a very intense sound which is mostly based on thevery personal lyric poetry of Ian Curtis.The film is a black and white biography based on his wife's book.Success means that he attracts more attention anda new groupie who begins to spoil his love based marriagewhile his epileptic fits get worse and less controlled.The pressures of his world seem to have been too much for this young poet.The movie has a very real honest feel to itthat harks back to a better era of 50's British cinema.
5,Great instrumental Nat,"I looked hard for a Nat King Cole album from his early instrumental period. This is it. A great reminder of how strong a pianist Nat was. The idiosyncratic trio (piano, guitar and drums) is a delight."
5,"Early Nat King Cole, the making of a legend.","Before Nat King Cole became famous for his vocal style, he was the leader of this phenomenal jazz trio. This 1992 release showcases Mr. Cole's roots as a jazz instrumentalist. If you're looking to build a great jazz collection, I highly recommend this compilation!"
5,Instector Gadget,"I found this CD at the public library and I probably listened to it about sixty times the next couple of weeks.The first song sounds like where they got the idea for the theme song for inspector gadget - let me know if you think this or if I am totally off the mark!+?This is not an indepth review, there are plenty of officiators of jazz that know what they are talking about - if the samples do not make up your mind, then check your libraryI recently got so busy with classes (college) that I forgot all about this album. I am glad a found it again!Notice that all the reviews are 5 stars - hint - wink wink, nudge nudge ...get yourself a copy and enjoyThis CD is excellent for listening to in isolation, while driving, in the background of a dinner or while reading a book"
2,Doesn't work.,I have nothing else to say except that it doesn't work. Used up the whole bottle on a certain area and scarring is still exactly the same.
2,Not sure if it works..,"I have an old scar that I tried this on. It hasn't gone away or even look anything close to fading. I'm not sure if it works better if the scar is ""new."""
3,This is ok,"I have used this for 2 months on a new surgical scar, really didn't help. Found much better results with silicone sheeting and even plain bio oil."
4,works well,"I have seen results from using this product. My scars have not gone away completely, but they lightened immensely. The product shows faster results than other scar medications I have used."
3,It's light and smooth,I've been using Scar-Esthetique Scar Creme for about 3 weeks and I have not seen any significant to my scar. I had a post scar from surgery and I would like to see the thick protruding scar to be less visible. The cream itself is nice and light and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly.
1,NON EFFECTIVE,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SCAR CREAM. IT DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT AND DO NOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE. I HAD TO STOP USING BECAUSE MY SCARS WERE ACTUALLY GETTING RED AND NOT GETTING BETTER AT ALL. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. I HAD TO SEARCH FOR A DIFFERENT CREAM TO HELP MY SCARS HEAL PROPERLY.IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TOO.
5,They got it right!,"While Something Cool was fine, Pete Rugulo and June sail on this album. Song selection, arrangements everything works. June was never better!"
4,An excellent collection of Miles davis hard-bop years,The best of the Blue note/ Capitol years is a compilation CD of some of the prime work from miles Davis early work as a bandleader and sideman during the 1950's. This colection mostly made up of Miles playing hard bop and really swinging. Much to like here from the uptempo bop tune move to the mid tempo enigma to the almost ballad like autumn leaves. Those are my favorites but even the other cuts are excellent. So why no five stars? There is a box set of miles davis capitol blue note years which contains all of the tunes here and then some. It's a little pricey but definetely wotth it. But for those on a budget that want to get a taste of an young Miles Davis it's definetely worth it.
2,Starts off with promise... ...promise is broken early on.,"Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman add humor in the beginning, however they are not the films focus. Ben Stiller provides a humorless part, I doubt he read the script because I don't know why he would choose to take a role where the supporting cast provides the humor and he is just the ""feel sorry for"" guy who gets cheated on during day one of his honeymoon. Debra Messing is much too likeable to play this part. We're suppose to hate her for what she's done to her new husband, but I just didn't. Now for Jennifer Aniston. She doesn't do to bad for playing a character that's about 25% developed. Need I say more? As for the romance in this romantic comedy.. Where was it? Did they even fall in love? Who knows? In the end Polly seemed unsure of what she wanted. I felt that the film was elevated above one star HOWEVER, because of Azaria and Hoffman. They played their roles superbly, too bad no one else on board was up to their par."
3,Witty movie,"This movie was interesting. I laughed the whole way through it. The guy who played Reuban's best man really got on my nerves, and I thought he was way too annoying to have in the movie. But I did like the main character of Reuban. Overall, it was fun to follow and I recommend it if you want to laugh."
3,Mediocre Personified Sillyness,"There are to many reviews for mine to ever be read, and whatever score I give it with 165 reviews mine will have no effect. That being said, I have to mention the characters, pace and story. The movie is the standard romantic comedy with a zanny story but the romance is low keyed and in its place is sillyness personified. As with all of Stillers rolles I am always waiting for him to slip into a Jerry Lewis slapstick routine. Jennifer Annistons performance was meant to be weird, and she accomplished it. However, her lack of physical charm and likeability I feel weakened her role and the allure of attracting Stiller. Some would say that Seymour Hoffman's added something. I felt he was just one of the four characters that failed to identify with the audience and made the total of likable characters at zero. The ending was good and did not fall into the stereotypical ending and with a good twist...and that was good!"
5,If you're in the right mood this funny,"I like Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston so this was a treat for me. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, I felt, was a bit over the top. Overall, this was a good way to spend an evening."
2,Crappy; Great actors,"I expected great things from this movie. Jennifer Aniston is an excellent actress (Her performances is ""The Good Girl"" and ""Office Sapce"" were spectacular), and Ben Stiller is, at the least, a talented comedic actor, who seems to be going the way of Eddie Murphy (talented comedic actor; starring in garbage movies).Even so, the only parts of this movie that are any good are the parts that involve Alec Baldwin and Hank Azaria, who are hilarious, in spite of the plot.The movie itself is incredibly cliched, and the lead characters are thoroughly uninspired, and intensely one-dimensional. If you enjoy laughing at sucky movies, then go for it; otherwise, avoid this one. Honestly, it sucks."
2,Polly should have kept moving ...away,"I like both Stiller and Aniston but saw absolutely no chemistry between them in this blatant attempt to raid the box offfice. If the preview looked funny to you - you saw all that really was funny in this movie. Otherwise, it just plods along and seems to go nowhere without any real laughs or charm. In fact, for a comedy, it is not funny. Hank Azaria has the best bits in a cameo at the beginning and again at the end. Watch it only if you are really bored."
2,Disappointing.,"This movie pretty much follows the same pattern as ""There Is Something about Mary"". We've seen it before and we've seen it much better. The attempt to keep it within PG-13 bounds probably hurt, as well. Once you get into R territory, all bets are off, and perhaps then this movie could have gone all out.The supporting cast is the best thing about the movie. Alec Baldwin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman bring the best parts for this movie. This movie isn't as good as ""There Is Something about Mary"", not even close. I'd almost put this film into the ""chick flick"" genre, but it's not bad enough to do this. Although it follows the usual pattern (guy meets girl, they get into a fight, they make up again, the end).Anyway, if your a fan of Jennifer Aniston, you will appreciate this movie (i guarantee). If you want some good laughs without too much thinking, get this, or better, ""There is Something about Mary""."
3,Let It Rain!,"This movie fits the mold of a romantic comedy perfectly. Stiller does well and has some hilarious moments. Jennifer Anniston supports his purpose and does well on her own, also.For me, the standout role was played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. From the equivocal sex and relationship advice he gives to Stiller's character - to his commentary on the basketball court (screaming out ""Let It Rain"", ""Iceman"" and ""Raindrops"" while his gut comes flying out of his shirt, for example), he is hilarious. Hoffman also gets to speak the most memorable line of the movie when he tells Stiller's character that he just sharted and that it is indeed time to leave the party.I recommend this movie if you're a fan of most Ben Stiller movies. It's a movie that will remind you of a dozen other romantic comedies, but it is worth the viewing."
1,Along came Polly....and there goes my lunch...,"Wow, another Ben stiller movie, MY FAVORITE! Hey Ben, you played the EXACT SAME CHARACTER in Something About Mary!!!! Wake up! Too bad the dog from that movie wouldn't even be seen with you again, they had to get a ferret to attack you this time! Do us a favor and cover yourself with honey for your next remake ""Gentle Ben"". Ugh.If you like Ben Stiller please ""See all my reviews"""
4,Along Came Polly,"Reuben Feffer's marriage is over before it begins when he catches his new wife with a scuba instructor on their honeymoon. Returning home distraught, his best friend, Sandy, drags him to a party where he is reunited with Polly, a girl he has not seen since high school. They start dating, and while attracted to each other, they are complete opposites. This is a genuinely funny movie, and Ben Stiller is in his element. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals the show though, as Sandy, the one time child actor and best friend of Reuben. Funny and well worth your time."
2,WHY BOTHER!!!!,"Nope, didn't think it was that funny. Too cutesy. Not a really good movie. Expected more, got less."
2,Completely Average in Every Way,Do not waste your time on seeing this movie...You've seen the best parts in the trailers (with the exception of the crude humor of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The plot is completely predictable and the comedy is squeezed into the story in a way that makes it un-natural and uncomfortable to watch...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Polly is barely worth renting.
2,Don't believe the hype!!,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I figured with Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller it could not be anything but great. The only actor with a humorous presence was Ben's geeky friend - a childhood actor still trying to cash in on the one good movie he starred in (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The ""relationship"" between ""Ben and Jen"" was so far fetched you didn't even want their characters to end up together. Ben played his usual role of an anal geek (which I usually laugh at). I kept waiting for the ""meat"" of the story line to kick it, but it never did. I still love this Ben and Jen but this movie was a complete flop. Save your money - wait for this one to be released on DVD!!"
1,ALONG CAME CRAPPY !,"This movie is as funny as, re-electing George Bush!It's a boring stupid comedy, with Ben Stiller thedork in it! If you want to laugh, see Elf!"
2,Two funny-ish scenes. Not much else.,"Ben Stiller can be very funny in a hapless sort of way, and Jennifer Aniston could become a fine comedian at some point. That said, there's not much to this little bit of fluff. The story about very mismatched people who meet and fall in love is not convincing for a moment. The movie feels like a rerun of something I've seen a number of times in slightly different formats and with different actors du jour. Appropriate for pre-teen girls. I'd feel ripped off if I paid $10 to see it in the theaters."
3,Enjoyable but Slight,"As a cute romantic comedy, ALONG CAME POLLY breezes along on the personalities of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston with a few laugh out-loud scenes usually missing from such fluff. Both actors make as much as their characters and situations as they can, and Stiller continues his sometimes excruciating exercises in humiliation that made MEET THE PARENTS such a hit.But the second half of the film falters since the suspense of its plot--will Stiller take back the wife who was unfaithful to him (on their honeymoon!)?--feels contrived and ridiculous. The audience would quickly turn on such a spineless man.There are worse ""comedies"" out there these days, so ALONG CAME POLLY is worth watching for a few laughs."
3,Marginal Recommendation!,"The film tries desperately to capitalize on the success of ""Meet the Parents"". I found Ben Stiller character to be annoying and unfunny. Jennifer Anniston was a waste and unbelievable. However, the movie works in places. I liked the supporting cast in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as the former child star. He makes the movie work everytime he's on screen. He is hillarious. Alex Baldwin continues to showcase is diverse comedic talent as Stiller's boss. And Hank Azaria is a trip as the scuba instructor. If it wasn't for the support cast, this movie would have gone down in flames. However, it's funny enough to recommend, just marginally."
4,Good nice fun movie,"I liked this movie. It's not a great film, but its a pleasant way to spend the evening. The two things that really stuck with me are (1) the soundtrack was excellent (why is there no CD available??? I actually came to Amazon today to buy it!); and (2) Hank Azaria was f-in' ripped! Is he on steroids, or does he write Simpsons episodes with a 50 lb. pen?"
2,Very misleading,"This dvd came in a movie jacket instead of in the actual case which just leads me to believe that it was stolen. It was a cheap movie, but I expected to get the case it came in. Very cheap of the seller to ship a dvd without any protection from the case. I was not impressed."
4,along came a good movie,"a simple love story taht is as funny as hell! poor ben!, you have to see it to understand! a cool date movie!"
1,Where's the chemistry?,"I've never written a review of a movie, but this one deserves it. I am a big Ben Stiller fan as well as a fan of Jennifer Anniston (especially Good Girl). I am very disappointed in both of them. This movie will make you laugh...if you enjoy potty humor and old gags...or if you are 10 years old. But there is no intelligent humor here. Most disconcerting is the lack of chemistry between the main characters. No character development whatsoever. Ben and Jennifer's character (I don't even remember their character's names...shows how much of an impact this ""film"" made on me) never mesh in this movie. We don't know why these two would EVER want to be together.RENT this movie. I hate the reviews of other people. You need to see it for yourself. Just don't BUY it until you've seen it."
1,horrible,"This movie is so gross and distasteful, I had to give up on it after the first 20 minutes. Stupidity really has no limits if the ""creators"" of this garbage expect us to swallow it."
3,WATCHABLE,"Given the mixed reviews the movie seems to be getting after the initial blitzkreig, I didn't exactly have tall expectations. The humor is indeed gross-out and Stiller desparately needs new gags. But I actually had a few good laughs and a pleasant time overall. It's a VERY predictable sort of a movie, after a fabulous role in The Good Girl, I wonder why J. Aniston went for this one. Don't expect Something About Mary and you should do alright with this pastime romantic candy."
5,Adorable,"Jennifer Aniston is an excellent, natural actress. Ben Stiller is from one of my favorite comedy families, Stiller (Jerry) and Meara (Ann), who are his parents. He has definitely inherited their talents. This movie is funny, touching, sad, and quirky. I love it."
2,Expected More,"I expected more from Ben Stiller and Aniston is certainly a good actress. I believe the story line could have been funnier. He's trying to change his ways for her, but I just didn't think it was all that funny."
4,"Funny & Cute ""Date"" movie","It's Ben Stiller, it's funny. Jennifer is always adorable. With a cute story to boot, but trust me guys, it's not a chick flick, it's funny, you will enjoy it too!"
3,Okay comedy.,"I was thinking that it was going to be a lot funnier. However, I did get some laughs out of it and I was interested the entire time. It's probably best if you rent instead of buying it."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"If you like toilet scenes and enjoy humor below waist, this is the movie for you."
4,Ben Stiller Fans Should Give it A Try,"I love this movie and it is more than I hoped it would be. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that Philip Seymour Hoffman felt really out of place in this movie and did a really bad Jack Black imitation. The entire time, he acts just like Jack Black, it is almost if Jack turned down the role that was written for him. If you are a fan of Ben Stiller, you need to see this movie because I couldn't stop laughing and I have a feeling that it will be the same for you. I've seen this movie many times and it is still as funny as the first time I watched it. Overall, maybe not as good as some of his other films, but still really funny."
2,Jennifer Aniston saves the day....again!,"Along Came Polly is so silly and annoying but of course the lovely Jennifer Aniston makes this film almost worth while. I probably would have turned this movie off if it wasn't for her. Aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one, she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. Ben Stiller is another story, he always picks the same, stereotypical role. I guess Stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part. Oh well, Along Came Polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon. I recommend The Good Girl or Reality Bites instead."
1,Amazing...,It truly boggles the mind that movies like this continue to attract an audience...which is exactly why Hollywood will never stop making them. This script was written in about a day. Take all the usual stuff...fill in with flatulence...and crank it out. Usually the endings of movies are predctable...this movie was actually predictable scene by scene. Stiller can be very funny...Aniston is also usually good...this movie was horrendous.
2,Weak,Weak movie. Kids thought it was boring. Parents too. Not as bad as Starsky & Hutch which was the worst of the worst.
3,Very funny but goes flat half way through,"I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable ALONG CAME POLLY was. Granted, it relied on toilet humour in many scenes, but you can expect that with this type of lightweight comedy. The film started to fall flat half way through, and became a tad boring. The remainder of the film was totally predicatable. However, you could do alot worse for a DVD to watch on a Friday night."
2,Very Disapointing,"I couldn't believe that Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston could ever be this bad in a movie together. Of course it had some cute little funny parts that made you chuckle quietly to yourself, but I saw this movie expecting it to be a hilarious comedy. The movie was long and drawn out and it was extremly predictable. The only thing that could describe this movie would be a HUGE YAWN. This is a good movie to rent for a night when you have nothing else to do. I would strongly advise against buying it."
2,More ammunition for those who don't like Jennifer....,"More ammunition for those who don't like Jennifer... That's one of the main consequences of this movie, where she has no chemistry with Stiller at all, and, once again, she is on a secondary role (like in BRUCE ALMIGHTY), and playing once again a slightly ""empty brain"" woman. I think all the deserved credit she has received by ""The Good Girl"" are going useles due to movies like this, where she can't hold the audience's interest in her character. Although the Polly character has its name in the title of the movie, this is a Stiller movie from beginning to end.There are good points, mainly Hank Azaria, but this is definitely a movie to RENT, not to buy at all!"
3,Not what I'd expect from Stiller,"If this movie were to be rated by Simon Cowell of American Idol he would probably call this movie, ""forgetable."" And it totally is. Jennifer Anistion is not that funny of a person. And Ben Stiller really lowered himself to do this movie. There are a few chuckles here and there, but the movie fails to hit its target. Its worth seeing once."
2,Will Ben Stiller Ever Be a Big Star?,"Not if he keeps making these ho-hum dumb comedies. OK, part of it is cute. The feret is cute. Jennifer Anniston is cute, but thats about it. Its a one joke sitcom of a movie. Actually, another sitcom star is in this movie, Debra Messing. She's not cute when she leaves good ole Ben during the honeymoon for a scuba instructor with large equipment. Ben is good at playing the loser, but lets give us all a break. Play a killer, a gay guy, a female impersonator, something interesting, but please!!! No more loser in love roles."
3,Decent,"This was an okay book, but for some reason I felt that something was lacking. I didn't feel as drawn into it as I have with other books."
5,its very good book,i loved reading this book. very inspiring. feeling mental peace. worth the money. shipped within 25 days. Go ahead if u love to keep urself motivated.
5,Kids always love Dora,"Dora is always fun and educational. My kids have all of the Dora's, and this one is no exception. I believe the early introduction of Spanish has given them a good start, my 2 1/2 year old son blurts our Spanish phrases or verbs on a regular basis."
1,The Worst S/W ever I have Used,"Simply, Do not buy this software. This is the worst software that I have ever used.Since recently I purchased iPAQ handheld PC, I wanted to remove my paper Franklin Planner. Than's why I purchased this ""terrible"" software.I spent several days installing and uninstalling this software and MS Outlook with no success. The only thing that I can use was not very useful Daily priortized list and master task list and others. Even I still have problems in pring the planner documents.I don't know why are they selling this product.Their technical support was not good and even useless.Never buy this product."
1,Microsoft vs. Franklin Planner,"I was throughly disappointed when I got my new Pocket PC to find that this horrid software was,albeit free, included at all with my purchase. The Franklin software does not even come close the the Palm version, steer clear of this software, remember this is MICROSOFT OUTLOOK for franklin planner, not the other way around."
1,Don't waste your money,"I can't believe I spent ...[money] on this worthless piece of trash. The idea behind it is good, but the interface is 10 X more awkward to use than Microsoft Outlook by itself. The tech support is a joke, and they even have the audacity to charge you... every time you have to call tech support. Can you believe it? THEIR product is screwed up, and you get charged to have someone help you with it.As the person below said, never, ever buy this product."
1,HORRIBLE - DO NOT PURCHASE,This item was a complete waste of money. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews of this product. It looks like the creators of Tron got drunk and spilt a beer on their computer while making this worthless material. DO NOT PURCHASE!
3,gatecrasher-digital,"Ha...whoever said that this was a bad set is totally wrong. Gatecrasher puts out amazing cds! The first cd has a permanent home in my car's cd player. It's really enjoyable to listen to while driving, and does NOT put you to sleep. I haven't really been listening to the second cd, but I'm sure it's just as good. And the chillout one is nice to do when you have work to do and such, and is just a nice relaxing one, totally fufilling its duty and name as chillout...Gatecrasher is awesome..and I totally recommend this one. But then again, who am I to judge it. Check it out and see what you think. I can't really decide on how many stars...as it's hard to judge that way..."
2,"boring, heavy, disappointing....","2 stars is all I can offer for this set. This one is very heavy, dark tek-trance. Really monotonous and boring. Don't risk driving while you listening to it, it might easily put you to sleep! If you don't already own Gatecrasher Discotech set or Global Sound System set, go for those instead."
2,Way below par....,"Depending on what type of music you like this one is really boring. 2 stars here in comparison with Gatecrasher Discotech set. 3 CD's in this one. Chill out CD is mellow, spacey, gazing-at-stars kinda of experience. Very slow and pleasant. But that's where the good news stop. The other 2 CD's are boring, pounding tek-trance, laced with hard-techno, banging tracks. I personally found myself flying through CD by pressing the ""next"" button on my player. Very disappointing. If you don't own Discotech set yet, I strongly suggest getting it instead of this piece of bordom."
2,Dissapointing.....,"After I got my hands and almost immediately fell in love with Gatecrasher Discotech set, I rushed out to get this one - Digital. Very, very disappointing experience. There are 3 CD's in this set. One of them is chill out CD, which is slow and mellow, and it delivers no more and no less than what it promises - it's relaxing music, cosmic sounds and sound effects, so it's ok can't complain here. But the other 2 CD's are mostly, hard banging tek-trance, sometimes even surpassing hard trance and going into hard core tekno. There are a couple of ""so-so"" tracks sprinkled here and there. I found myself pushing the ""next"" button on my CD payer most of the time. So for those of you who really liked Gatecrasher Discotech set, and in general like high quality dutch trance, skip this set, you will not find it here."
4,charming and sweet,"I'm surprised how quickly those below critized this book. For the record, I HATED Bridges and found it almost unreadable. This book may not rank up there with Flaubert, but it was a heck of a lot better and more earnest than Bridges of Madison County. I have not read Gazebo, but Grayson does a nice job sketching the twin sisters who have never been great friends, one living in the shadow of the other. Nick, Harper's son, in very believeable and well drawn. The relationship between the sister's is believeable as well and nicely outlined.Though it may be predictable, this book has an unpretentious charm about it that made it thoroughly enjoyable to read. In fact, it's a sweet love story that avoids torrid sex scenes and errs in favor of a relationship. David, the teacher/astronomer is a compelling hero --- I love the description of his observatory! It's a quick read, but one that cheered me up and carried me along."
4,NOT AS GOOD AS HER FIRST ONE,"I really enjoyed this novel, but I have to admit I enjoyed ""The Gazebo"" much more. I agree Ms. Grayson has a rare talent for touching the soul, and she did continue with this book. I definitely would recommend this one, (and have to many of my friends), but if you haven't read her first---you need to."
2,very predictable and run-of-the-mill,"This is a short story about a love-hate relationship between two twin sisters, one famous and one not, one divorced with children and one not, who have only one thing in common - a man. Shortly into the book, the reader knows exactly what is going to transpire and how it will end. I read this in one evening - it is very easy reading. If you simply want a run-of-the-mill romantic story, read this. Otherwise, read a Michener or something with much more substance, more of a plot and something that requires thinking."
4,a good effort,"While ""Apartheid Is Nazism"" is the supreme Alpha Blondy recording, ""Masada"" finds out hero in good form, giving us his message in 3 languages, thus showing the universality of the music he makes.For me, this is a great improvement over his prior 2 efforts, ""Jerusalem,"" and the very disappointing ""Jah Jah Seh."" Blondy is known for his very eccentric nature, and I think it reared its ugly head on those recordings.This album is more back to basics for him, and the results, including the gorgeous ""God Is One,"" ""Peace in Liberia,"" and the touching ""Mystic Night Moves,"" show that Alpha is making his way back, and the music from his band the Solar System (the modern day Sun Ra and his Arkestra?) is excellent.This lp is a return to form for Alpha Blondy, and is recommended."
2,HP's legacy of mediocrity continues,"I did not buy this printer. I got it for free. I bought a v40 at Sears, and Kudos to Sears for replacing that HP when it developed ""carriage stall"". I'm quoting HP technical support (I know a lot of people who had a similar problem at about the same time I did). I just needed something that did stand alone faxes for my wife's use, and now that I've experienced HP, I would definitely recommend products by Epson or Canon (which I also own products by). I work in graphics and computer sales, so hopefully my advice will carry some weight. Most disappointing is the fact that HP continues to crank out printers which CANNOT load a piece of paper straight. I'm not even going to go into how bad the software, scanner and technical support from HP are here; this isn't a novel. On the upside: it does print really crisp and clear."
2,Printer Function has Problems,"When printing from the internet, the printer will jam. Also the printer will restart the computer on it's own. The fax and copy parts work great. I am using windows XP"
1,I hate my HP all-in-one printer.,"I have an older HP (Office jet G55Xi). It worked sort of ok for a year or so (each print job did crash the network), but when I upgraded my network well it quit working. I have the Jet direct server, which can be upgraded, and presumably that would help, but it requires a PC (I have macs) to do the upgrade. Soft PC does not seem to work. SOOO I figured I can just use the USB port. No such luck. My mac cannot find the printer when I hook it to the USB port. However, the HP installer does crash my computer. So, I call them. Its out of warranty. Please have your credit card ready to pay for support. NO F'N way buddies. I will never buy another HP product, and (especially if you are a mac user) I urge you to consider companies that actually make usable products. It makes a pretty good copier at least. Other than that its a rather expensive paper weight."
2,Took It Back For A Refund Just In Time,"I bought this one because I wanted the flat glass for the copy function. However, it wasn't worth it. This printer tries to do too much, is cheaply made, and has a user-unfriendly menu. The software is full of bugs. You will be spending many hours trying to figure things out and calling India where customer service seems to be located. I was very lucky to get it back to the store within ten days for a full refund. And as you might figure, the store was a pain in the neck and said that they couldn't believe that I was having trouble with this model. Duh!"
2,weak,Had this machine for 6 months and hate it. Loud and annoying. Very buggy and difficult overall to manage Waste of money. Next time I'll read these reviews.
2,Same as the rest ok till a jam,Worked ok till fax feeder jamed. 1 week trying to fix it will probably give up on it.
1,Do Not Buy This Printer!,"I have had problem after problem with the HP 6110 All-In-One.It started with the paper jamming and eventually it stopped printing alltogether because it ""claims"" that its out of paper. Another great example of poorly engineered American electronics. THIS PRINTER IS PATHETIC!"
4,I must have gotten one of the good ones!!!,"I, too, am surprised at the number of negative reviews for this printer. I have had this product since it was first released several years ago. I am a CPA and work in my home office via a virtual office connection (Atlanta to Dallas). It is a workhorse with a sheetfeeder that works great for scanning and emailing work related documentation in .pdf files, receiving or sending faxes and printing labels/letters/envelopes. I want to replace it with a Samsung Laser printer but there is no justifiable business reason to do it. My experience has been that it is a really great printer!!! I'll feed my piggy bank instead of replacing it."
1,Save your time and money,I bought one of these thinking the automatic feeder would save me loads of time. Now instead of minutes it takes hours. HP's tech support's only advise was to buy more equipment and to reboot my computer. I thought they realized we outgrew that trick 10 years ago. When I tell the machine to read from the feeder it reads from the flatbed and vise versa. Don't spend your money on this untested product. The only nice thing I can say about this product is that if you can keep it working for more than 1.4 minutes it can print four pages on one sheet of paper.
2,Clicking as we Speak...,"The machine worked great for awhile. Then came the clicking noise and the lost printer jobs. I have tried to update firmware, drivers, cleaned reflection mirror and that worked at one point in time. Now I sit here writing this review while it clicks. Ah finally the scanner error screen. It comes as a relief since it signals the end of the clicking. Other than this constant clicking noise coming from the scanner the machine worked fine. Had a few paper misfeeds in the document feeder but never really had a cartridge problem. I suppose I will continue to buy HP but factor in only 1.5-2 years of performance. Have a Deskjet 960c and 970cse and they have been at it for at least 5 years. The 960 printed a few thousand pages for a senior design project and still works fine."
2,Very disappointing scanner,"The scanning function of this machine is extremely disappointing. The HP software does not mesh well with Adobe Acrobat at all, if that's what's you're using to create scans. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the software many, many times, and it still acts up. HP doesn't appear to have a fix. The scanner ADF feature doesn't always work well either--and there's a real problem with knowing if 4 or more pages are even going to 'take' or just drop off. The photocopy and FAX functions work well enough."
3,Takes forever to print,"I don't know how they could possibly say that this is 19 ppm. It has a ""fast"" copy mode but it still takes about 2 minutes and that is for a faint gray copy. I didn't have a digital copier at all before so it's still nice to have. I have sent a fax, printed in color, scanned and copied from the document feeder.Also, you will have to buy a duplexer if you want it to copy on both sides and I think they are $80-100. That was an unpleasant surprise as well. Since it is cheap it is a pretty good deal but I really thought it was going to be sooo fast and it's just not."
3,Good printer. Drivers did not install properly at first.,"Good printer. Drivers did not install properly at first and required several calls to HP's help desk. Not that it works, I really like it."
2,Quits when you need it the most,"Like others, my 6110 stops in the middle of a photo print job. The only way to start it again is to completely remove the s/ware package and reinstall. Then you start the whole process again. A few photos printed and it stops.I'm having a terrible time finding a multifunction that does what I want, when I want.When it works it does a beautiful job, but the trick is to get it to work."
1,"Don't buy this, you'll be sorry!!","I'm on my fourth machine. I bought it from Sam's Club and thankfully bought the 3 year extended warranty. I can't begin to list all the problems it's given me. Right now, I can't get it to print. It's done this many times. You have to uninstall the software and reinstall it. It's such a pain! Just save your money and don't buy this!"
1,Deservedly Discontinued - There Should Be a Recall,"The worst HP Printer I have ever owned. Mechanically nice, but what good is that when the software is so poorly written that every print job is an adventure?You may find that a perfectly routine print job simply stops printing, forcing you to go into the print menu and restart the printer. Or that your grayscale presets have changed to color. (When I complained to HP about this, they said it was a known issue but they had no useful solution.) I have had the printer for about a year at least, have upgraded the software and used it many times -- I see no improvement. It's as buggy as it was on the day I got it.Do not buy this printer, even used. Do not accept it as a gift either, unless you have endless amounts of free time and don't have anything important to do with your life."
2,Great product...for a little over 1 year,"Same as many other reviews. This all-in-one worked great until one day the dreaded ""carrier jam"" appeared. Seems that many owners experience this total melt down with this printer.It should be called an all-OR-NONE, since it will not print, scan, fax or copy."
4,Another Reason to Use a Mac!,"Good things for smart people! This machine is a compromise, of course, but, all things considered, It's great.I would give it 5 stars, but, it doesn't do all things as well as stand alones. All of you complaining, I see, are using windows. I know the pain... Also, about HP's having ""carriage"" troubles, that's very simply a cleaning job. The clear tape that runs the length of the carriage, Keep it clean!Other than that, HP has it all over Epson (stupid dirt and dust collecting paper feed), it's a good professional quality machine, and you can't beat that duplex (print on both sides) option. A no brainer!I've owned them all, and needed an all around, I'm happy I stuck to HP.Pete"
2,Total Disappointment,"I have always used HP multi function products with much success, the HP 6110 is a dud ! I have had three shipped to me & spent much time & effort setting them up only to have each one fail. The fax works only sometimes & only to certain numbers. I other parts work but are very slow & the machine makes the same grinding noices that convinced me to replace my old HP 570. How I wish I had it back !"
3,The Quick-Buck Banditos strike again,"This thing is OK when it works, but like all the other items offered by the mega-conglomerated PC devices and systems giants, it is obviously a shining example of how marketing triumphs over all corner-cutting and lack of support. I have just about had it with the likes of Compaq, HP, and of course Ledd. Er, I mean Dell. The ""sell em and leave em"" attitude is just too much for me to bear anymore. This machine is just that. Like other HP computer products and systems I have known over the last several years, it has so many corners cut that it is nearly round. I suppose the price reflects this, but people should see that mainly you still get what you pay for. A PC for $299 is not a powerful workstation, and an All in One printer/scanner/fax for under $200 here is not a professional office quality machine, either."
3,HP is not my choice,"I am a long time PC user. I have purchased HP, Cannon and Epson printers. I will never purchase HP or Cannon again having learned my lesson with software and installation of HP and to a lessor degree, Cannon. Epson shines and is always my first choice.Seems like users need to access support quite frequently with HP products, good luck."
4,HP 6110,"I JUSY GOT THIS MULTIFUNCTION HP 6110 YESTERDAY AND LOVE IT. SET UP WAS EASY,ALL THE FUNCTIONS WORK GREAT. I HOOKED THE FAX TO MY PHONE LINE AND IT WORKS GOOD, EXCEPT CAN,T USE THE PHONE WHILE RECIEVING OR SENDING A FAX BUT I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. THE PHOTO QUALITY ON THIS MACHINE IS VERY GOOD, I USED PHOTO PAPER, DID,NT EVEN USE THE NUMBER 58 INK, THOUGH I GOT IT JUST INCASE I DO NEED IT IN THE FUTURE.HOPE IT CONTINUES TO PERFORM WELL.."
4,This isn't a bargain....,"Hewlett Packard lists the retail price of this printer as $299. Amazon.com, I'm disappointed!"
1,LOUSY. Don't bother,"This machine lasted 137 days. Used it maybe 80 times. HP would not replace it, they insisted on repair. I Sent the machine in and it was returned unchanged. They still would not replace it. I had to send it in again. I have had to buy another machine to replace it. Terrible service and a piece of junk."
2,HP 6110 is junk,"From the beginning, I had problems. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because of all the features it has and when it does work, it prints well, but from the beginning I had problems getting the ink cartridges to be recognized correctly. I sent it back once under warranty only to be sent a re-manufactored unit. Then along comes another problem and I can't get new cartridges to align correctly...brand new cartridges!!! I called the obviously India based HP tech support folks and they said they could help with the problem, but it would cost me $30 because the printer was now out of warranty. I said no way and vowed to never buy another HP product, much less a printer. My first printer was a Canon black and white bubblejet and it worked like a champ for 10+ years! Never again! Save your money!"
1,Bad machine,"I've had this machine for a little over one year. I frequently had technical issues with it, it didn't seem to like my Mac powerbook. Then, a couple weeks ago it stopped working, displaying a error message ""Check printer cartridge."" Which I did, to no avail. Their web support page went through a series of suggestions, including cleaning the cartridge slots, which I did. Their final suggestion was to buy a new set of cartridges, and if that didn't work, the unit would need servicing. Needless to say, I was a chump and wasted over 30 bucks on a new cartridge and the unit still doesn't work. And its out of warranty, so its not worth fixing.Boo."
2,Countless software re-installs,"I can't tell you how many times I have had to uninstall and re-install the software for this machine. It worked fine for about a year. Then I started having problems. Whenever the fax function is used, the entire machine freezes and the software has to be re-installed. Sometimes the same thing happens with the scan function. When it worked, I was happy with the scanning until recently. Now black lines are appearing on all the scanned pictures. It appears that the underside of the glass needs to be cleaned. According to the HP website, cleaning the underside of the glass should NEVER be attempted by the consumer. Thanks a lot! Am I really going to pay someone to clean the glass of a 2-year-old machine? I could probably buy a new one for the price."
2,Great idea. Too bad it has so many problems.,"This is fax machine, copier, printer and scanner all in one. That's an excellent idea and three weeks after I started using this machine, I wrote a rave review.Not long after that, however, it started acting funky. The printing -- when jobs actually went through -- went from very fast to cranking out one page every three minutes (reserve a few hours if you have any large documents to print). The copier was temperamental. The scanning function has never worked properly. The tech support is not helpful, they tend to have only about two solutions per problem and if those don't work, such is life."
3,Carriage Jam Error,"I bought my HP 6110 about 18 months ago. It has always been a noisy printer, and the ADF never worked that well. Recently there has been lots of carriage noise, and now a ""carriage jam"" error shows up. I've checked it out several times, no jam I can see. Back to CompUSA for an exchange tomorrow under my 2 year extended warranty. I'll be selecting another printer,not the 6110, but I haven't figured out which yet. It will be a Canon or Epson, hope I make the right choice."
3,Great Idea...still a few bugs?,"My main reason for purchasing the 6110 was to replace an old Brother-560 fax machine. At the retail outlet I realized I could upgrade my printer (and what an upgrade the 6110 printer is!), and replace my scanner at the same time. First lets get all the great things out of the way. It scans, prints, and copies better than I have EVER seen before. My problems are with the FAX RECEIVE. ALL faxes that I receive are cut-off on the right side. A perfect 1/4 inch margin shift to the right on ALL faxes that come in. I have returned the unit and am on my 3rd one with the same problems. So far HP tech support has no answers. This unfortunately may be my reason for going to another manufacturer."
5,HP 6110 all-in-one,"Great Machine................What a great surprise, after reading about all the problems with other machines(both HP, Canon, Brother, Epson etc...) I was really expecting some problems with setup and use.What a great suprise, the setup was easy and painless. All the functions work without any problems. I have had the machine for 2 months, I use MS XP. Pat"
1,hp 6110 is a POS,"Dont buy this printer, or anything from hp. Their customer support is horrible, the printer is a POS. Mine didnt even last a year. They told me they dont even have the parts to fix my printer, and they would sell me another one for $260.00. Yeah sure, I will be right there!!!! Not a chance. Look elsewhere."
3,Yea dey ok,They played heavy and everything but they cant sing. Its just your average garage band that never took the time to work on vocals and some sort of orginazation in their songs. They can play but thay cant put out a very song.
3,"Yum, yum, yum! But somehow....","...this flatter, gooey version of Aplets isn't as good as the firmer, rectangular type found in the boxes. Why is this so? It's almost as if water were added to the candies to allow them to be smashed flat for packing. I thought my favorite thing about the Aplets was the flavor (I don't like Cotlets and this is the only way to avoid having to buy them with Aplets), but the texture is just as important. These ones seem to have a less consistent powdered sugar coating, too. Until Liberty Orchards starts making these more like the boxed variety, I'm not sure if I'll buy them again--they're that different."
2,"Build quality okay, sensor doesn't detect things below the lamp. Overall ok.","I gave this light 2 stars for a few reasons:1) Sensor is terrible at detecting things directly below the light. I wanted to install this light for my porch right outside of my door. I installed it about 7' high in a 4'X4' porch. The sensor would not pick up any motion anywhere 3.5' (radius) from the light. I have to stick my hand up and wave at the sensor to wake up the light. I think part of the problem is that the sensor is flat (perpendicular to the ground) which prevents the sensor from detecting things right below the light.2) The build quality is mediocre. Lamp looks better in picture than actual lamp. The actual lamp feels and looks more plastic than the brass/casted-steel appearance in the picture.Otherwise, the lamp does work. It detects well (not right underneath the lamp) at all sensitivities and does everything as advertised."
3,"Good looks, bad sensor","The fixture looks good, assembly is easy, fixture quality is sturdy.However, the sensor, although good in the areas it senses, does not have a wide range, especially below it. I have set it at 7 ft height and it doesnt pick very well, for someone walking on the pathway next to it, if s/he doesnt have a height of less than 51/2 ft.My exterior wall is shiplaps, so it doesnt align very well with the wall."
4,180 DEGREE MOTION,I LOVE THIS COUNTRY COTTAGE LIGHT I PUT IT BY THE FRONT DOOR AND IT LOOKS GREAT I JUST CAN'T GET IT TO TURN ON.
1,poor sensor,"nice looking lamp,not made from metal so no corrosion or fading, but the sensor is not sensitive. I have to wave my hand in order for the light come on, when trying to put the key in my door"
3,Wish it was real metal!,Is a great replacement part! Too bad the original degraded so quickly by water staining.What happened to real chrome plating?
5,Great stuff from Fluke,"It was around Oto where Fluke really picked up their signature sound, but that album was a showing of their darker side. So they let their singles do the more upbeat stuff. The Gosh mix is the one that later appeared on Progressive X, and is incredibly fast and danceable. Mosh is the same track that appears on Risotto, and still good. Cosh is essentially an extended instrumental of Gosh. Posh is a slower version, and is a great way to end the single. True, half of this can be found elsewhere (3/4 if you can just imagine Gosh without vocals), but the songs are good enough that it doesn't really matter."
5,It means everything 'cause it swings,"Honestly one of the best Jazz albums I have ever heard and one of the smartest buys I've ever made. Benny Green, Christian McBride, and Carl Allen are flawless. Christian's solo on the Shiek of Araby is so melodic and beautiful. Benny transcends everything else when he plays the piano. I have listened to this album so many times and have yet to get sick of it. The first track Don't Be 'Shamed teaches to express yoursef and love every expression. It's absolutely amazing"
2,Hot-doggin,"The Cole number (Beautiful Moons Ago) is a pleasure to listen to, and this may all have been a lot of fun if you were there, but what comes through on the recording too often is a group of musicians vying for attention without synergy or heartfelt emotion"
4,Very Good,Recorded in 1991. The sound samples speak for themselves. This is straight ahead jazz played by the masters. Good sound quality.
2,Where have I heard this before,It's a great album--when it was done by Oscar Peterson 30 years before it.
3,No tool,"The chin rest is fine, I just wish it came with the necessary tool for tightening the posts. Disappointed that one was not included with purchase."
3,"Music Lust, hold the Cream","Interesting book with compiled lists of various genres, etc. that I will check into, BUT, one glaring error on Nic's part is the exclusion of Cream and Eric Clapton. Personal choices aside, I find it hard to understand how he could possibly overlook ""Disraeli Gears"", which Cream released in 1967 to much praise, not to mention the single ""Sunshine Of Your Love"". Clapton was involved in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (one album) and in The Yardbirds (one album) and gets hardly a passing mention in this book when he should have had an Icon chapter, also. ""Clapton is God"" wasn't a made-up slogan without something to back it up. I'm sure Harcourt was trying to save space since his book would have been much bigger had he found the need to include more selections, but to leave out Eric Clapton and Cream? You get 3 stars from this child of the 60's, Nic."
2,"Good reference, maybe. Not very readable!","My Operating Systems course used this book and we were assigned chapters to read every week. It was incredibly painful. This book does not read well at all. The ideas aren't very well motivated. Many times, Stallings just enumerates a list of alternate strategies for solving a problem without talking AT ALL about how the strategies came or why we should think about all these different strategies in the first place. He just lists and describes them. Very dry.I eventually stopped reading the book and just used it as a reference when doing our open book online quizzes. This worked well. It's easy to find specific information (""How does Round Robin Scheduling work?"") and the explanations are reasonably clear and concise. But if you're trying to actually read it sequentially to get the general idea, you're in for some pain (and sleepiness)."
3,A Good Reference Book,"This book serves as a good reference, as it contains just about every topic related to operating systems. Like an encyclopedia, however, this is not a book that you want to read cover to cover. While all the material is there, it is not necessarily in any logical order and the material is presented in an extremely dry but straight-forward manner. I found other operating system texts, such as Tanenbaum, to be better for tutorial-style learning. But as a reference text, this book can't be beat."
4,Contrarian opinion,"I happened across this book in the library.Call me an idiot. But unlike many of the other reviewers, I find it to be lucid, informative, and well-written."
3,"The flirts, greatest hits","This Cd shown other mixes that we can listen in ""the best of the flirts"", for example, ""Passion"" or ""Helpless"", but they are repetitive. The expect about one good mix has additional and different music than the radio version.One excellent point of this CD is to include the remix of ""jukebox"", not easy to find on this times."
1,Not impressed,Hard to add to the other reviewers thoughts but I didn't like anything here.Ordinary noise that isn't quite music to my ears. One song keep up with a scratching noise that was looped and drove me nuts. Another track looped a very young child babbling and again drove him crazy nuts.Save your money.
4,Kenton ahead of his time!,"If you like big band jazz sounds of the late 40's and early 50's do yourself a favor and buy this one. I purchased this LP album in the late 50's and played it over and over, then I lost it in a flood in the 70's and recently found it in CD form at Amazon.com and purchased it again. You can bet it will be kept high and dry. Good stuff! Mick"
4,terrific quality,"This is a great recording of terrific music. But this Capitol reissue has one major flaw. I have the original stereo album consisting of the cuts recorded February 11, 1956. Selections 1 to 13 were all released in TRUE STEREO on the original LP. With the exception of the alternate take of Minor Riff and the last three cuts (recorded in 1958)the remaining original cuts from the Capitol LP were issued in mono on this Capitol jazz CD. I do not understand why Capitol will not issue the CD in the original stereo format."
4,Very thorough...,"...but very soporific. Do not read in front a warm fire.Interesting, but could have been a series of books. Lots of information, interesting analysis of road signs in the middle east. Author is native palestinian and gives an inside perspective on code switching. High quality, but *very* dense text."
5,great disposal,"This disposal is great. very quiet, easy to instal. Needed it to replace existing cap switch. ( no wall switch) magnetic touch works great with my aluminum sink. I have installed a few of these and they are extremly silent. Amazon had great price as well"
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"The cover control depends on the disposal sink stopper to turn the disposal on and off. There are magnets in the stopper that make contact when the stopper is turned. After less than a month, the stopper was very rusty and contact could no longer be made and the disposal would not turn on.You'd think they would make a stopper that wouldn't rust, since that is critical to the operation of the disposal. To their credit, InSinkErator sent a tech out and he replaced it with an equivalent non-cover control model and even had 1/4 additional HP, at no charge. This one operates with a wall switch like most other disposals and it works great.The Cover Control model is not ready for prime time. I recommend against buying it."
3,InSinkerator Evolution Cover Control,"This Garbage disposal replaced the Pro 17 series which was excallent. Needing to replace the original one after 17yrs, I went w/this new replacement model(according to Insinkerator) for ease of installation. I find it too quiet and sometimes it turns on very easily w/the magnet attraction and runs when you don't even know it's on. This could potentially cause damage to the unit if the water isn't running. Other times it is hard to engage the turn on. It also catches alot of food in the cover which should be washing down the drain. I wish I choose a different ISE model."
3,cover,"There is a problem with the cover control in that it dos not activate easily on one side & only on the side that acts as a total stopper for water which is the opposite of what it is supposed to do. IN other words, the side of the cover which is supposed to activate the disposal is very difficult to manipulate whereas the side of the cover which as to stop water is the only side I can use to activate the control."
5,"Great product, excellent customer service","I confess that we've owned InSinkErators for years. Many different models as they grew and evolved. This one is terrific and worth the price. If you don't know how to install it, then get a plumber to do it. The seven year warranty is good for all parts including the 'stopper,' which is the piece that also turns on the machine. No food flyback, no spillage. Some don't like the inconvenience of stuffing food into the disposal while it's working, but that's sort of not a smart thing to do anyway. It is super quiet, highly reliable and so well backed up by the manufacturer that we consider it the best buy on the market today. Divide the cost by the number of years you can expect it to work and your annual cost is way below a tank of gasoline that you can burn just going to the mall. :-) Well, close anyway."
3,Quiet but a bit less convenient,We bought this to replace an older version that we had in three different houses we have lived in. The new model is very quiet. The downside is that you have to turn the stopper upside down to use it as a stopper rather than to turn on the disposer. In this position it collects water in the stopper which needs to be emptied and washed out to keep everything clean. You can wash the stopper in the dishwasher but then you can't use it while the dishwasher is running. This would be an easy problem for the company to fix by just putting a couple of small drain holes in the stopper.
1,Does not work,My plumber installed it but it didn't work. He used multimeter to check and said it has a short circuit. Fortunately Amazon's return policy is great.
5,InSinkErator Evolution Cover Control 3/4 HP Household Garbage Disposer,Purchased this unit to replace an old Kitchen Aid unit with the exact same features.Very easy instillation for a do-it-yourselfer like me.Quiet and powerful. Can't go wrong for the price.
1,"Uhhh, sure doesn't taste like rum...","Doesn't taste like rum, not even a little bit: Both my wife and I felt it smelled exactly like nail polish remover, and it tasted even worse..."
3,Great Voice +++++ Songs +,"I am giving 5 stars for Bocelli's voice and 1 star for the composers of the songs, averages 3 stars. This is only album that I would not buy. I tried to convince myself that it's good listening the samples over and over again and reading all other reviews. Sorry, did but not work... :-("
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD the day it was released and was terribly disappointed. I love Mr. Bocelli's ""Sogno"" CD but this was nothing what I expected. I am sure he will do better next time."
5,He Makes It Look Easy,Andrea is an inspiration to both see and hear perform music from all genres...he polishes everything he sings until it shines like gold. I look forward to many more years of entertainment from this dedicated professional.
4,A new style from Andrea.,There were some ugly songs in here.(I absolutely hate to say that about anything Andrea.)But the good far outshone the bad.Un Nouvo Giorno stunned me the first time I heard it.It was so unlike anything I had heard from Andrea- very pop.But it soon grew on me.Liberta is amazing.Very catchy and upbeat.Sempre O Mai is my favorite.It keeps its tempo up and has the best of Andrea and pop.Great song.So this album was really a double album with pop and classical songs interspersed.A good mix from the master.
4,One of the best Bocelli yet,"This CD is very good from begining to end. My favorites are #5, 6, 8, and 10. As other reviewers said, this is a very ""pop"" album, and with such, there is a great variety of styles in this CD that lacked in Tuscany Sky, Romanza, or Sogno (although all 4 are great to listen to). Highly recommend this CD if you are looking for a light, upbeat, and thoroughly enjoyable CD experience."
2,It's not what I expected.,"This album is more pop then any other recording. All the songs to me sound the same, like one long song. His voice is like he's using only 30% of potential. Many times I was not even sure whom I'm listening to: Andrea Bocelli or Enrique Iglesias.Very disappointed."
5,Music that catches the heart!!,"I am a newcomer to this artist and recently heard him during a skating event...wonderful!! This was a beautiful CD and altho primarily in Italian, wonderful listening!! I keep it in my car and am blown away every time. Have ordered two of his CDs and not been disappointed!! The reviews on Amazon.com also helped me decide...along with the music snippets...which ones I wanted to try."
5,Passion of the Heart,"With his latest recording ""Andrea"", I had no difficulty finding songs that surpassed my previous exposure to his music. Although I was disappointed that the ""Andrea"" CD omitted the english translation in may of the songs. I was still moved by the recordings which appeared to be a blend of pop, classical, and opera, a special gift to the listener. ""Sin Tu Amor"" with Mario Keys blended beautifully with classical guitar and ""When a child is born"" it brings sweet memories the dreas I have had for my own children. ""Go Where Love Goes"" brought me full circle to my first exposure to Mr. Bocelli. What better way to find calm and tranquilty in my thoughts but to listen to the angelic voice of Holly Still and the soul and passion of Andrea Bocelli."
5,Got boys? Get this!,"Both my boys 5&3 have watched Michael Michael motorcycle at least 100 times! It's funny, educational, and inspiring! I love the outdated classic plot and as a mom, I can go another 100 times watching this sweet movie!"
4,TuneCast II,"Good universal FM transmitter. It covers the full FM spectrum. The instructions come with a link to find the best FM signals in your area - I am able to stay on the same station from Baltimore to Dulles. The sound is no better than FM quality but of course, it can't be.It eats AAA batteries - I have to change them once a week. However, I have rechargeables and always keep a spare pair in the car. I've never experienced my TuneCast II's memory erasing itself when the batteries died - my presets remain after I insert new batteries. Of course, you can skip the batteries and use the included DC power but I don't have all those spare DC outlets."
3,buy the mobile power cord for better performance,"I took the TuneCast II on a road trip to Canada, and I had major problems getting reception all the way between Chicago and Toronto. It seemed to help if I was touching the unit, such as if it was in my lap. It also burned through batteries. Now that I bought a mobile power cord (//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001J3Q9W), it seems to ground the unit or something, and I never have problems with reception. The sound quality is decent, but not great. I have to turn up my radio considerably to pick up the sound. It's easy to work and does a decent job. Bypass this and plug directly into you auxiliary jack if your stereo has one."
2,some help with the static,"the first day with the unit i wasn't actually using it in real world conditions, just sitting in the garage trying to find four stations that appeared to work ok to put into the memory. that done, i put it in the glovebox and went back inside. the next day on the way to work, i found that i was getting a lot of static on all 4 of those channels.. except when i reached over to pick it up to change stations (an accident in the making, as another review stated..) as long as i kept a hand on it, the reception was not cd quality, but probably about the same as radio quality. after a bit of thought, i looped the headphones a few times around the transmitter's cable, then strung them over the passenger seat's sun visor, and i haven't had to mess with it since.so, clearly the device wasn't tested very well, it does need a longer antenna, but you can makeshift a reasonable solution."
1,Buyers Be Warned,"I received this as a gift for Christmas and at first it was fine, at first. It works but not amazingly well and then all of a sudden it stops working. It's supposed to sense an unused radio station and then turn on but if it doesn't sense anything you're stuck. Don't buy this."
1,Buy the one that comes with the power cord instead,"A lot of people have been saying this transmitter doesn't work like it's supposed to. That's not necessarily true; it's crap if you use it with batteries, but works well if you get the mobile power cord to go with it. I couldn't believe the difference. The transmitter DOES provide you with near CD quality sound through your radio, but since you must have the power cord to get that sound, I give it a low rating for misleading package information. Plus my cord that connects the transmitter to the power cord has a short in it after only three months, so if I move the transmitter at all, it clicks off. You're better off buying the Belkin kit that comes with the power cord; you'll save yourself a lot of money and grief."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"This unit is TOTALY WORTHLESS! Please don't waste your money! Heck, you can have mine if you want it, but it's not worth the postage to send it to you. Sounds like your speakers are stuffed with wet socks, if you can find a station that isn't pure static, which is nearly impossible. I'm shocked that they can actually sell a product that is this poorly designed. I made an oath never to buy anything with the name Belkin on it again. Are you getting that this is a really, REALLY horrible product?! No kidding. No axe to grind. Thought it was a great idea. Gladly paid for it, and eagerly tried it out. EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED!!! I guess I should have read the other reviews. If you still choose to buy one, don't say you weren't warned."
2,poor performance,Tunecast II has a poor performance meanwhile playing into the cars. The 4 freq one does better.
2,Works good after you modify it. Mediocre out of the box.,"I was disapointed with my purchase of this product. When checked it momentarily after opening it seemed to work satisfactory. But when I really began to use it I discovered how difficult it was to keep it tuned in, and keeping it static free was almost impossible. I have high end eqipment so that wasnt the problem.Since I had thrown away my reciept and packaging I decided to take it apart and see if I could hack it in an attempt to get better signal output, and work better it does. I posted what I did at pcawesomizerdotcom. If you are stuck with one of these, this will make the performance far superior to what it is out of the box."
1,"Disappointing, at best","I absolutely LOVE my I-Pod and decided that I had to take it everywhere. Unfortunately, I do not have a cassette player in my car. Solution: Belkin's Tune-Cast Transmitter--it would be easy and perfect.I was in for a suprise. If you live in an area where there are many unused frequencies, this can be a wonderful idea. However, my commute is along a major highway in the Boston area, and it is impossible to find a frequency that will allow my music to transmit with minimal static. I was constantly adjusting the radio, then adjusting my Transmitter to find low frequency stations. Finally I decided to leave the I-Pod and transmitter at home. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I wish the store I bought it from would have taken it back."
2,Belkin FM Transmitter,"I read in the description this was in very good condition. When I got it, I found out that it was at best in fine condition. It was a little beat up, had corrosion in the battery slots, and some sort of gunk all over it. I was not told in the description it needed the car power attatchment to make it work, even if it did have batteries. I was quite disappointed to learn that it was not in the condition it was made out to be. I cleaned it up, and it works fine. I am happy with the product, but I am not happy with the seller."
2,Good Sound--very short range,"I purchased one of these from Walmart. When the input is at higher volumes, the sound is faithfully reproduced, but the transmit signal strength is very weak. With a sensitive receiver, the range is around 4-6 ft.; for typical, consumer FM radios, expect a good range of around 24 inches.I have two other FM transmitters, an iRock Beamit and an older analog tuning model; both greatly outperform the Belkin.The unit transmits quality sound as promised, however the effective range falls far short of the 10 and 30 feet promised in the User Guide."
1,Junk,"this item creates so much static in my music. If you keep it about 4 inches away from the player, it plays ""ok"". If it is 2 feet or more away, the static really is unbelievable. I would not recommend. do not throw your money away."
1,Less convenient than the radio,"Well, I bought this for use in my car because it is a battery operated transmitter and my cigarette lighter port is blown out. I thought it would be nice to listen to the ipod in my car, and my non-battery operated model works like a charm. Not so with this one. I know the fcc regulates fm transmitters to low power, but this is ridiculous. I only got a clear signal if I actually touched the transmitter to the car antenna. I thought it might be my car, but it did the same thing with the other three cars I tried. To make matters worse, as some of the previous reviews state, the batteries run out very rapidly, making it worthwhile to invest in duracell stock if you plan on using this product for extended periods of time. Overall very poor performance."
1,Waste of Money,"After receiving the TuneCastII to used with my iPod Nano, I noticed the batteries would go dead in the TuneCastII even when the unit wasn't being used within a two week period. I contacted Belkin and they said to return the unit to them and I paid the shipping. I received a new one from them and sure enough, this one does the same thing.It appears that the unit is still 'on' even though it appears off using up the batteries. Maybe this is due to the 'auto' on/off signal function requiring power to work. I'd rather just have a normal on/off switch to use and save on batteries. Or supply the car adapter with the unit instead of having to pay another $20 for it.Besides the battery issue, the transmitter is very weak and after trying numerious locations in the car and different frequencies I have found listening to the iPod Nano more of a pain with the TuneCastII and have gone back to just listening to the radio.Don't waste your money on this item!!!!!"
1,Save your money,"This product barely transmits when it's on the dashboard, let alone if I try to set it on the passenger seat next to me. When it does work, the sound quality if pretty bad--very static-y. It's hard to find a wavelength that works--even with frequencies that sound practically clear, as soon as I try transmitting over it, I end up with all kind of interference. The signal just isn't strong enough.Also, it does eat batteries like others have said: Two batteries only last between 2-3 hours. And the little piece of junk is even poorly made: the plastic wire covering separates from the transmitter and causes the signal to short, which pretty much makes the whole effort worthless."
4,Best one out there,"Comparing this FM transmitter with my Belkin TuneCast 1 and another off brand transmitter, I'd say this one is the best. All FM transmitters have very short range however (government regulations on FM bands)."
1,Extremely weak FM transmitter,"I tried this unit with both the alkaline batteries and the companion charging cord (which works fine) and found the FM transmission to be so weak as to make the unit practically useless. I discovered that by pulling over, remaining stationary with my arms in a certain position that I was able to get ""three star"" audio levels, but that was it."
2,better things out there,"i didnt like this one because1. it hangs from the ipod, does not attatch snugly2. it moves around and makes my ipod pause3. connection not great.if you want a better one, i suggest the maxell one. It connects right into the top and sits like itrip, great reception, and runs off the ipod battery."
1,Disappointed,"Despite the other reviews, I decided to give this a try but I wish I'd gone with the casette adapter instead (those are getting better reveiws, especially the Coby). The static gets pretty bad, both in my hometown and on road trips. Its hard to find a consistent station (even at home where I can use the same one regularly) that doesn't pick up alot of static at some point. Like another reviewer mentioned, it works best when you can HOLD the transmitter in a certain position in relation to your radio or antenna....but its not exactly convenient!The product also seems to be cheaply made, the cord has pulled apart from the piece that plugs into the MP3, exposing the internal wires. I think its too late to return it or I certainly would!I also thought I had seen that this unit came with a charger that plugs into your cigarette lighter, but it does not; it is a DC adapter."
1,Worthless,This is a total waste of money and engineering. Plenty of free frequencies in my area and it would barely connect to anything. Sound quality horrible even when the device is right next to the antenna on a portable FM player. Wrapping it back up and sending it back.
1,A nightmare!,"The Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter is a complete nightmare. The product stopped working after only a few uses. While it did work, it ate through batteries, sporadically shut down, failed to power up, and generally caused headaches. The broadcast quality was so poor that by the time we moved the thing (with iPod attached) all around the car to find reception, the batteries would be dead. A complete waste of money. Replaced it with and iRiver AFT 100 and will never look back!"
2,Low signal quality,So poor signal. You need to be really close to the antenna to get a good signal. Wouldn't buy it again.
3,Maybe!!!!!,"It seems to work only on 1 station and is very staticky, but you get what you pay for!!!!!"
1,overrated,"This product is overrated! The battery life is low, they had a rechargeable model that is no longer made (I had one and at least you didn't have to buy batteries often). This model has terrible transmitting capabilities. If looking for an FM transmitter, Don't buy this model!!"
1,Static was unbearable.,I live and work in rural Iowa where not all frequencies are used. I tried this unit in 3 cars and in my home. In all 3 cars the static was unbearable regardless of which frequency I selected.The only way this was satisfactory was if I used the battery option and used the transmitter inside my home with the unit right next to the radio.The only reason I gave it a ONE star rating was that ZERO or NEGATIVE ratings were not an option.
1,Horrible !,This is one of the worst FM Transmitter's that are sold without directions and once you figure out how it works - the performance is quite dissatisfying. There is way too much static & noise feedback and the volume control even at it's max on your car stereo combined with their highest volume setting still requires anyone to opt for a hearing aid ! Save your money and steer clear of this unit !
1,Piece of junk will cost you in batteries,"Don't be a fool. Save your money and give this product a wide berth. Lousy reception and battery life of barely an hour, plus battereis continue draining even when the damn thing is off! Must have been invented by the folks at Eveready. I called tech support once, and all they could tell me is that I must have bad batteries. Signal doesn't hold, even 5 feet away from the receiver. Sound suffers, with an underlying hiss. All in all the sort of product that makes you take note of the manufacturer's name and be warned."
2,It's OK,Works well with my boom box (use it while I work outside). That's because it can be placed close to the antenna. Not very effective in the car where the antenna is outside the car.
1,Very bad reception,"This item is really not worth the money. I tried this device with 2 different MP3 players on 3 different radios and the result was always devestating bad. It worked but if you want to hear music in stereo close to CD quality, that's what I expected, then this device is not going to cut it. It's like short wafe radio in the 70th."
1,stay away from this,"do not buy this product, i have tryed all frequencies it will allow and my effort has been rewarded with a headache and loud static throughout the ordeal even though i have my steros FM antenna right next to it!!! ridiculous device! and ridiculously low quality. use ur 30 dollars for extra speakers, not Belkin Tunecast II Transmitter."
1,Very Frustrating,"I bought the Tuncast II for use in my car with an iPod. Like a lot of the other negative reviewers, I live in an area with very few free frequencies. I was never able to find a frequency that was without static and it didn't matter how I adjusted the volume.It did work well in my house using the reciever on my entertainment system but I could just plug it in there with the cables that came with the iPod so wasting the money on this just for that purpose doesn't make much sense.There is another hidden cost. This transmitter eats batteries like there's no tomorrow. I only used it for about a week and went through 3 sets of batteries.I loved the idea of the transmitter and wished it had worked but I ended up just going back to the store and buying the cassette adapter. I'd highly suggest just skipping this one."
2,TuneCast II Mobile FM Transmitter,"I bought the TuneCast II Mobile FM Transmitter because I do not have a tape deck, and I was happy to know I didn't have to use a lighter too. Anyway, I wanted to listen to all my music in my car from my i-pod without making a cd for everything. The device ruined the experience for me because I cannot get a good sound without static and bad reception. I was disappointed."
1,How could ANYONE be happy with this product?,"I seriously cannot fathom how anyone can be happy with this product. I have a very high quality tuner/reciever that could not even pick up a clear signal from the TuneCast II from anything over a foot away, regardless of the frequency chosen."
1,Worst FM Transmitter,Plays with static regardless of which station you find. Any point in a song with bass is just scratchy. Seller was great and fast with delivery but the product isn't good at all.
2,Piece of junk....,"This worked for a while, but not well eventually it just stopped working entirely and when I got a smartphone with Pandora capabilities I bought an headphone link cable to plug into my head unit for my stereo in my truck and now that's really all I listen to. Meanwhile this product got to meet this bottom of my trash can, where it really belonged."
1,The worst transmitter ever!,We've had a Belkin transmitter in the past but this one was just awful! You never get quality sound out of this thing.. it doesn't matter which station you put it on. It just doesn't work without fuzz in the background! :(
2,Not the best,I bought this and it just didn't cut it. There was ofter bleeding through of other stations and had a lot of hssssss. I wound up buying the pod-freq and that worked out pretty well.
1,Not even close to what you paid for,"anything that kind of works, doesn't work. This Belkin Tunecast kind of works.The unit has to be in the right proximity to the antenna of the radio from which you want to hear it. Even then, it doesn't even approximate what you get with either a cassette adapter or a stereo cord to the line in jack of your home or car audio system. Something that kind of works is a poor value.Battery life is irrelevant in a device which fails to transmit a signal as good as even a weak FM station. It would have been much easier to sucker consumers into buying this ounce of trash by adding an iPod charger. Thank goodness for consumers who pay attention to reviews before buying such rubbish."
2,Great... when it was working.,"I bought this, at a very reasonable price. It worked for a week and then, when the first set of batteries died off, it never worked again. It won't even power on. But, for the one week it DID work, it was decent enough for the price I paid for it. Not sure if I'd recommend it, mainly due to the fact that it no longer works."
1,Dont waste your money,"I was so excited when I got this. I took it on a look road trip, and well I couldnt use it half the time because of the radio picking up to many stations. Normally this wouldnt be a bad thing, but the transmitor in this device sucks! I tosed it out at a Walmart, and went inside the store got me a durabrand one, it works like a dream and was only $12. I think my new modulator would override oneelses radio going down the highway a few cars away!"
2,Not worth a try.,"I bought the Tunecast II hoping it would play well with my Zen, but I was sadly disappointed. The sound quality was horrible on every station. This may be due to the fact that my antenna is in the back of my car, but most people's are. The only way I could hear it without extreme amounts of static was to hold it in my hand, and even then it was less than acceptable. A remarkably horrible product!!!!!"
1,Hunk of Junk,"Worked for 6 hours, then just stopped transmitting. What a waste of cash. Do not buy this."
4,Quite happy and have recommended it to friends,"I found the Belkin Tunecast to be quite good when using it with my iPod. While there are times when you can hear static on your radio, but that's because you've entered a region where this a broadcast station at the same frequency. Because the Tunecast has the flexibility to tune to any station, you can easily change it to another frequency where there isn't any broadcast.I also use it with the power cord that has the ability to charge the iPod as well. I haven't found another product that has the same combined benefit."
1,Sounds like AM radio.,"Does it work? Yes. Does it sound good? NOT HARDLY! I will be returning mine. What a disappointment. The only use I could see for this is if you are a person who downloads podcasts of talk radio shows. That would work fine for this application. But music sounds TERRIBLE. PLUS, you have to crank the volume up so high on your player AND turn the volume up on your car stereo in order get the same volume you would normally get at half the setting on your stereo."
4,Take Command Game,"When the game arrived it did not contain a game instruction manual inside. I realize that the game may have a tutorial on the disc, but I couldn't get the game to load up on my Windows XP computer. I owned this game a year ago but lost it in our move. It loaded up and played nicely on the same computer that I tried to install this game on. I have not been happy with this transaction."
3,gameplay,"i guess i was thinking i was getting something like red alert type game, but it's not.In open battle, winning is no problem. in the other part of the game, i guess i don't understand what i'm doing wrong.In one of the levels, i have to hold a certain position for 15 minutes. I'm clearly doing that, but when the timer gets down to 10 minutes it disappears.Also, im having a hard time controlling the Ai.Any tips? Just not ready to give up on the game yet."
3,Very fun,"This game shows what civil war Generals,corlnels,and commanders whent threw and how they commanded. The gameplay is my favorite part it letsyou command small armies and huge armies. You can be all kinds of your favorite generals like Robert E. Lee or Stonewall jackson and many more generals. also when you command cannons you can choose witch type of cannon ball you want to fire. During the game you will recive messages during battle from other generals. The graphics arent as bad as Sid Mires civil war collection.Overall this is my favorite computer game. If you like civil war games than i suggest you buy it!!!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"Each page of the tutorial is so long and complicated that by the end of that page's instructions it is difficult to remember all of the points of that page's instructions. When attempting to actually manipulate the players on the field during the learning period, the figures don't move as they are supposed to do. I was truly disappointed in this game, overwhelmed by it and it is now not being played at all. I found it a wast of time and money."
4,Coldplay + Travis = Starsailor,"The best way I can think of to describe Starsailor is actually pretty simple: the lyrical style of Coldplay with the instrumental style of Travis. Much like ""Parachutes"", all throughout ""Love Is Here"" you can pick up on the deep well of emotions driving the songs. Two particular songs on the CD in which the emotion is pretty evident are ""Tie Up My Hands"" and ""Way To Fall"". I'm a real [stinker] for pianos too, and it's got some great - if fairly simple - piano parts. It just helps to round out the band's sound.While James Walsh does have a great voice, his pounding vibrato on the high notes will make you want to cringe sometimes. That's a very minor complaint though."
1,Love Is Here - Not,"...Please don't compare this band to U2 or Blur. Real fans of those bands will be mightily disappointed in this product. The first two songs are OK, but the melodies disappear from there on out. The musicians are talented, but the music stays well below calibre. The whininess of the lead singer was more than I could bear after only three tries..."
2,starsailor sinks,"i bought this album mostly based on the rumors of starsailor being the next travis or doves or coldplay. I admit the band, that is, those in the band that play instruments deserve a 5 rating, but the singer has to be kidding. His whining and crooning, and ridiculously over dramatic lyrics degrades the overall quality of the album and the band. Everyone who has rated this a 4 or better must have the instrumental version:) I love Britpop, but this album is a major disappointment and naively overrated.oh yeah, if you have the turin brakes album, ""the optimist lp"",listen to # 8, ""Slack"", then pop in starsailor and listen to # 10, ""good souls""."
2,The rest of the Album is nothing like Goodsouls,"I dont know maybe I was expecting too much but the rest of the album is nothing like Goodsouls at all. As far as guitar and drums are great but their lead singers voice is just so high pitch to me. It really gets annoying to have to listen to the guy pratically whining through the rest of the album. Well, I think someone wrote that if you like Coldplay you like these guys, well to tell you the truth I dont think you will unless you like listening to grown men whine. BEFORE you buy this album listen to the cd, or download a few of the songs."
2,"Like Robert Plant singing bad ""power ballads""","Imagine the worst hard rock ballads of the late 70's and early 80's, written by corny has-beens like Styx or Journey---have a Robert Plant impersonator provide the vocals---and provide some largely acoustic accompaniment, and you'll essentially have this CD. Sappy sentimental broken heart lyrics filled with rhymed cliches, repeated over and over. The nostalgic familiarity and some imagined sense of the band's ""potential"" must be what are causing people to sing this group's praises; the music itself is not breaking new ground in any way."
1,Unimpressive,"I was suckered in by all the hype in the British press. I usually avoid that pitfall, but after they were correct about the strokes I thought maybe they were turning their act around. Wrong!!! I could barely listen to any of these songs all the way through. The lyrics were laughable, the music pedestrian, and the singer's voice was plain annoying. Save your money and buy coldplay instead."
3,Needs Work and Critiquing,"I was rather disappointed with this. I really like their second CD. However, this one failed to impress me. I like there first few songs and then a couple at the end. All though some of the lyrics were almost too dark and didn't seam to flow well with the song.I do hope the band continues with more music. I just think they need to work on their technique."
1,Stuck on the Shelf,"I take this one off the shelf only to dust it I'm sorry to say.A great cd, in my opinion, will move you lyrically, vocally, as well as musically, and this cd is lacking in all of the above.The lyrical composition is weak, obviously not a lot of thought went into touching the listener with them. The vocals are totally annoying, not to mention whiny. Musically, the beats are common mainstream and lack all strength throughout most of this cd, although they do hit home sporadically within a few bars, which only accentuates the flaws that lie therein.The one star granted to this cd is for the acoustical intro for the opening song ""Tie Up My Hands"", after that, this song, as well as this cd, falls apart miserably!"
4,Perfecting The Wheel,"I will never quite understand why people persist in putting down similar bands when they are reviewing an album. Music isn't a competition. Simply put, if you like Coldplay and Travis give this a listen. It might not reach the heights of ""Parachutes,"" but its consistent quality has made it one of my favorites of this year. The songwriting is excellent, the vocals are strong, and the simple musical backing enhances the experience. These guys aren't reinventing the wheel, but for a debut, they've made an impressive attempt at perfecting it."
2,Lifeless and Boring,"The music and singing was good, but it's not something you want to listen to. I didn't really mind it, but I felt sort of repulsed at times because it seemed superficial. Listen for yourself, but not one of my favorites."
2,Where is love?,"I first heard about Starsailor when Ian McCulloch of Echo & the Bunnymen named them as potential savio(u)rs of British rock. If that is true, I think our brothers across the Atlantic are in trouble. I find the CD ho-hum at worst, and decent at best. Creatively, it's a bit one-dimensional, despite the good musicianship of the bandmembers. I agree with some others here that the singer's voice is not for everyone, it's got a little too much treble (read: whine) and not enough bass for my taste. Good Souls is probably the best song of the lot, although it still couldn't touch the work of the likes of Richard Ashcroft (formerly of the Verve)."
1,ugh... the voice,"The main reason I dislike this CD is the same reason I bought it. I liked the singer's voice on Good Souls... but after 2 listens I never want to hear his Meatloaf-meets-Radiohead moody straining again. Aside from that nails-on-the-chalkboard voice, the music is just plain boring. For one, the acoustic guitar format is limited in terms of sound. Secondly, the harmonic elements to most of the songs are very similar as well as the tempo. They all drone on some minor key, changing chords at the same time in every song, throwing in a major V where necessary. Every song sounds a bit like Hotel California. Good Souls is the only tune I can listen too anymore. Go get some Coldplay or Travis if you want some good, moody, british rock."
1,One good song an album does not make!,"Interesting sound...interesting vocals...But I liked it better the first time around...when it was called ""The Verve""!"
2,Nothing in comparison to Travis or Radiohead,"if u like radiohead and travis and even coldplay, u r not gonna like this one. the best song here is still worse than the average songs of the 3 bands above (such as ""sparks"" by coldplay, ""she's so strange"" by travis and ""climbing up teh wall"" by radiohead)somebody gave me Starsailor's ""Live in London"" DVD, i was curious of the band, so i gave it a try. Result..........Totally disappointing!!the songs are just repetitive and lifeless, with anger. i can stand anger, but i can't stand the fact that almost every song sound the same. and it's nothing originalso i did a analysis: here it is:MOST OF HTE SONGS HAVE THE SAME PROGRESSION STRUCTURE AND THE RECORD SOUNDS LIKE A ""FAKE PUNK ROCK BAND""'S ""CRAPPY LOVE SONGS COLLECTION"".THE ONLY GOOD SONG----------cant remember the title, i think it has the word ""all"""
5,it really brings love here,"I was in a music store looking around and they played good souls, i asked who is singing, as the singer's voice was fantastic, i bought the album and flow back home the same day, I listened to it on the plane, i simply loved it, I agree that it is a bit depressing but the singer's voice is just fantastic, some of the songs really touched me deep inside. I loved the harmony between the singer's voice and the guitar. And now it is played regularly in my house, shared it with some friends.. All bought the album"
2,Its ok,"I'll keep it short. There's a few good songs on Love Is Here, but most of them are kinda sappy. Good Souls is a good song though."
2,"...no, sorry","it's not even that they're an especially good band, but rather, they sound similar to other good bands. melodically fine, but there's no excuse for the sappy, sappy lyrics - ""alcoholic"" in particular is unbearable. and the only way to justify ""the next radiohead"" comparison is to say that radiohead were nothing like radiohead on their first album. hopefully this guy will find his own style, because at the moment it's just not working."
2,Mediocre as mediocre can be...Its bound to be a big hit...,"Starsailor sounds like the Frogs without the interesting lyrics. They present us a dose of subtle ""genius"" comparable to Radiohead (More pale skinny English boys with chips on their shoulders). But then again...mediocrity is what the public loves...just look at how many albums that Sting and Paul Simon have sold. But seriously folks, loads and loads of people will just flip their lids over this one. I'm a completely elitist music snob, and I really don't find Starsailor offensive at all (like I find Sting and Paul Simon). I just think that they're pretty boring."
2,Dung,"If I were a member of The Verve I would sue Starsailor. This is third rate Verve at it's best. 99% of Love is Here is boring, sleepy and forgettable. Starsailor makes a strong case for creating a music police who would be allowed to stop bands once they start to make bad music. I give it 2 stars because ""Talk Her Down"" is a great song. I'm puzzled how they did that. I'm sure they will sell a lot of copies of Love is Here. 9 times out of 10 bad music sells to the mainstream music dope... errr I mean listener."
4,Sounds Like Suede To Me,"And that's OK, just don't expect anything original. Pleasing melodies, acoustic guitars, anglo-vocals, and downtrodden lyrics. Yup, I've heard this before. And the band was called Suede. Still...it's good stuff."
4,First Time for Everything,"I think this band has real talent, I find them to be very emotional and they take that emotion to a very high limit, somehwhere between love and hate, lies and ignorant liars. Starsailor is a very unique band. The lyrics are great, and the melodies are very hypnotic, I really enjoy this band. The guitar solos are awesome, whoever plays the guitar in this group rules!!"
4,Starsailor was the other dream brother,"Well, on the contrary, maybe this band was inspired by Jeff Buckley's father, Tim Buckley, rather than Jeff himself. Then again, I have neither heard or read any interviews of the bands influences nor do I hear the influence itself come from their music. I say this because Tim Buckley was ""star sailor"". Star Sailor was an album by Tim Buckley, one of his earliest. This album is mediocre at best. It has a certain aura that accompanies Jeff Buckley's Grace album. I would have to agree with an earlier comment, Jeff was amazing. I wont base the bands rating on a level with Jeff or Tim but am giving it their own."
4,Good,"Emotionally raw vocal delivery coupled with decent driving background. It's on the lighter side musically, but the vocalist makes the music sound more emotionally resonant at times. He sounds distraught, or bittersweetly happy. Solid album of songs that you might not listen to with a full sitting, but still good."
2,Three Strikes and Your Out!,"I listened to this album 3 times and was still not able to get it! I'm a huge Brit fan (Radiohead, Oasis, Coldplay, Travis etc..) and I was looking forward to a new sound for 2002! This ain't it mister! The lead singers voice is impressive and the members of the band are talented (good piano and guitar work) but mix it all together and it sounds odd and somewhat forced. Listening to it for the 3rd time had me bored and quite honestly depressed. I purchase about 3 new cd's a month and this is the first one I had to return in over 2 years - if that gives you any indication of how unhappy I was with this album."
4,If you dig Suede.... your going to love this!,Starsailor's debut sounds a lot like Suede. It has great tunes and is a pleasure to listen to the music mood they managed to record on this best of the year CD
1,what a letdown,"I thought this might be something close to Coldplay or Doves. It wasn't. As a matter of fact, it's about as far from that as you can get. The singer has one of the most annoying voices since Geddy Lee...and that's saying something. After 3 listenings (hey, I tried!) to this utterly amateurish and grating stuff, I tossed the CD out."
2,Rubbish,"Starsailor was great the first time I saw them...when they were called The Verve.Now though, what's gotta be some form of Verve spinoff project has replaced all of their pure rock and trippy melodies with sissified whiny love songs. This CD is awful.The lead singer's (Richard Ashcroft's evil nemisis) caterwauling becomes irritating after about 12 seconds. The songs are dull, slow and repetitive. And let's be honest, their band name is lamer-than-lame. Isn't Starsailor the name of a Japanese morning cartoon or something? It sure sounds like it.And what's happened to the once powerful Brit-rock scene lately?"
1,There is no love for this CD,"This CD is cheap for a reason! The whole CD is unoriginal, boring and not worth listening to. Don't waste your time or money!"
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful",The headline says it all. The lead singer made me want to throw a brick at my very expensive stereo. He ruins the otherwise decent grooves and OK lyrics with his fingernails-on-a-blackboard voice. Yuck.
2,bad lyrics and stale melodies,"I heard a great deal of hype about Startsailor from critics both here in the States and the U.K. The first single, ""Good Souls"", was pretty darn catchy and ... I thought the album was a good buy.Then I put it into my discman. Maybe this album is not meant to listen to while commuting cuz it was bad. Everything here has been done before and done better. The melodies and vocals remind one of The Verve and Radiohead. But the lyrics just ruin it - ""Your dad is an alcoholic, blah blah blah.""Over the weekend, I put it on while on a road trip to Montreal and got drilled by my friends. I couldn't even defend the choice - listening to it was making me sad and ill. And not in a Morissey kind of way.Save the dough and buy some classic brit pop. Stay away from the Coldplay/Starsailor garbage coming out. It won't last."
2,the Verve?,"The above words caught my attention in a review of their ""fever"" single in Q magazine (back in January 2001) so I waited, and waited, and waited.....and eventually bought this on importwith high hopes. Their general melancholy vaguely resembles Travis, Coldplay, and even Jeff Buckely but they have a folkier sound that's hammered home by this non-stop, saloon-sounding, jugband piano. It resembles a Carole King album more than any modern british ""guitar"" band and that's the missing element here. If James decides to plug an electric guitar in next time(plug that piano in while you're at it) then I might get interested. Meanwhile if you decide you still want this album, keep your eyes peeled on that ""get it for less"" section here at Amazon because you might see my copy there soon."
4,Give it time-wonderful Masterpiece,"When I first bought this album I loathed it and found it boring and too melancholy.A couple of weeks later I started to listen to it again and gradually I began to love it. It is definitly one of the best albums to come out of the UK over the last decade. It has a unique beauty inspired not least by James Walsh's amazing, moving voice. The standard of songwriting is truly exceptional nothing compared to the Verve or other Britsh bands that they are falsely compared to. I see the people who have given this album bad reviews have judged this album on just one listen. You need to give this album time to grow on you. These arent songs that you can walk around and subconciuosly sing or whistle to yourself, you need to listen to this album carefully to appreciate its beauty and moodiness. My favorite songs are 'lullaby', 'Way to fall', 'Fever'.By the time this fantastic record closes with the hushed 'Coming Down' you will feel as if you're floating in Space."
4,Pleasant,"Quite simply, what sets this young band apart from other Britrock fare (Ocean Colour Scene, Elbow, etc.) is the vocal talent of singer James Walsh. Comparisons to Jeff Buckley have been made ad nauseum, but they're not too far from dead on. Most of the songs are keepers, a couple of them are classics. There's not too much here that disappoints."
3,Very decent album,"There a few songs that are quite enjoyable, but as an entire album I think it lacks quite a bit. Starsailor has a very different sound than a lot of other Britpop, mainly because of the lead singers voice. He is very good at being an emotional singer, but not to the extent of a Jeff Buckley or a Thom yorke. ""Love is Here"" gets old very quick. The love was there and then gone. I can come back to it occasionaly, but for the most part it has stayed in it's case. I'm anxious to hear a second album, because I do believe this band has a lot of good qualities. This album is worth purchasing if you are new to the genre of Britpop along with ""The Man Who"" ""Parklife"" ""Parachutes"" and of course ""The Bends"" (these are of course simply starting points). For those who have heard everything the genre has to offer...skip this one."
1,Extremely Poor DVD,"A complete and total waste of money. I bought this to learn from a master after seeing Len dance on DWTS. Though this covers several dances the instruction is virtually worthless: After showing only the mans steps (as I knew from previous reviews-no worries-I dance) there was no showing of the basic steps shown in rhythm, only set show routines by his dancers. Len-SHAME !!!"
3,Pretty good--but not for the coordinational-challenged,"I found Dance with Len Goodman to be quite entertaining, and generally easy to follow. The eight dances included on the DVD are high on style and easily translate into both casual dance environments and those special nights out.However, if you struggle with watching someone else complete a task and then repeating it on your own, this might not be for you. The Quickstep, in particular, poses a strong problem for learning on your own. But Goodman reminds us throughout the program that this is a first step in learning these wonderful dances--if you enjoy the moves and the exercise and the magic, follow up with a local dance studio or instructor.For good clean fun--and some special time with your significant other--this DVD is a great starter. You also learn some of the history and evolution of the dances, as well as some of the keys to making the holds and posture look like the pros!"
1,Slow delivery,The book was exactly what I was looking for but it took close to a month to receive it. Similar books ordered after this one from other companies came weeks ago with the same shipment option. I will never order from them again.
3,Days of Speed,Live CD with some Jam/Style Council songs too. I prefer the original bands versions of those.
2,Rehire the band,"Sorry folks, I love Weller as much as the next man, but the Amazon reviewer has got it right. Weller is a good lyricist, not a great one, a good acoustic guitar player, not a great one. Solo acoustic is an unforgiving way to put your wares on display. These songs need the trimming. One of the greatest things about Weller anyway is his pop sensibility. Take away the arrangements and you've taken most of it away. What's ""Above the Clouds"" without the Marvin Gaye soul groove, ""Out of the Sinking"" without the electric assault, ""Headstart for Happiness"" without the horn chart? Not nearly enough."
3,Not for all Guitars,"I'm pretty sure this product was not designed for acoustic guitars. While it still sorta works, the design was made for a slim guitar such as an electric guitar.It doesn't support my guitar very sturdly, anything that touches til could tip it over. It's small which I really like."
4,Just Say Something,"A documentary anthology focusing almost exclusively on writings by and about people using drugs before the 1960s -- before, as one of its editors states, ""the modern era of drug use and drug hysteria."" The sources collected within are excerpted from some of the more usual suspects, like Jean Cocteau, Aldous Huxley, Albert Hofmann, and Baudelaire, but there are also a few surprises (for example, Mark Twain and Sigmund Freud). The reader will come away with a newfound understanding of how unoriginal much of our present dialogue over similar issues actually is."
5,LEGENDARY: SOME OF THE GREATEST MINDS...ON DRUGS!,"This mesmerizing collection of essays shows a wide range of ideas concerning drug use at a time when most drugs were still legal. The foreword is by William S. Burroughs, with an introduction by John Strausbaugh. Essays include examples by Jean Cocteau, Aldous Huxley, Albert Hofmann, Baudelaire, Anais Nin, and, believe it or not, Mark Twain and Sigmund Freud!"
3,What's with the cover?,"In gazing at the cover of this book, I couldn't believe the photo they chose. That's an Atlas rocket, which Shepard never flew on. He flew on a Redstone rocket.How in the world did this huge mistake get by the fact-checkers? Any space fan with at least a basic knowledge of space history would know this."
4,intriguing bio of a Great American,"I found this bio to be well written, and informative on not only Shepard, but also the Mercury Seven and the beginnings of NASA. It charts the mans abilities, and also his shortcomings, and well evokes the period of the space race. I thoroughly enjoyed it, highly recommend it and recommend the From Earth to the Moon miniseries as a good companion piece."
5,compelling story,"This well written book tells the story of astronaut Allan Sheppard, a man of great talent and courage who, as one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts who were all called heroes before they ever went into space. Sdeppard was a man of contradictions - a national hero with a huge ego but very shy, a devoted husband and father who chased every skirt when away from home. Thompson did a great job, I could not put the book down!"
4,The paperback is much better.,"The hardback version of this book was an extremely entertaining read, but was unfortunately marred by many basic factual errors. It is good to see that the author took the time to fix the major ones for this paperback edition - it is a much better read for it."
5,The best!,"I have been using these sun glasses for about 10 years. WalMart used to sell them, now I have to order them online. Can't find anything wrong with them. Large, cover everything front and sides, just an excellent product. Ordered 6 of them just in case this time. My personal best product ever!"
1,Badly susceptible to RFI,"I bought two of these because I wanted short high-quality cables from my Rega DAC to my Goldpoint SA1 and then to my power amp. I was replacing some el cheapo cables, one of which was way too long. When I put either of these into the system I started getting a small but definite ""ticking"" like a pop on a vinyl record about once per second. I traced it down to an RFI (radio frequency interference) problem which these cables failed to shield, but my other cheapies did not. They're utter rubbish, although they do look and feel good."
5,great,"This is a great toy. I gave it to my daughter at 1 year of age- too early. I put it away and tried again when she was almost two. It has lots of neat little things to do. The bears can be played with alone, or in their cars, or in the play center. Lots of switches and knobs and things. She did pound too hard with the play hammer on the shapes that get hammered thru a whole, and fell down and cut her lip, but I can't see how that is Chicco's fault. They really make great toys. Their activity table (not the electronic one - the one with the train, instead, an award winner) is wonderful. This is a great break from Fisher Price toys."
3,Only tryed once,"Unfortunately I bought this to change out a GFI outlet in my bathroom. When I got it I tryed to use it, but due to the test switch in the middle of a GFI outlet, this cannot be used as it will not line up with the holes for the outlets. This is the reason for the 3 star rating."
4,Best Antenna for the money!,"Excellent Antenna, at an excellent price. Plugged in and received every available HD station in my area. Better than amplified RCA model, which is definitely going back to the store. It's amazing it pulls in such a good signal with no amplication."
1,ZDCTV1Z Digital HDTV Antenna,"While this product may indeed pull in a week signal, any benefits are outweighed by the flimsy construction. The one I purchased didn't work at all until took a closer look and found that not one, but two solder points were broken and had to be re-soldered. There was obviously no QA at all done after assembly."
5,American Pastime,American Pastime This is a fabulous lesson in history and a fun and clean movie. I recommend it to everyone.
3,Safe by a Hair...cut,"Illuminating, intriguing, but imitative. ""American Pastime"" is an uneven, unnuanced film featuring some worthy themes. For me, the strengths outweighed the flaws, with my favorite scene being Lane's haircut."
4,History Lesson,"A well done portrayal of a pivotal time in the history of the United States. American Pastime reveals a portion of what life was like for the Japanese-Americans incarcerated in Relocation Camps. Tasteful in showing the hardships and challenges that faced families living in camps, it was true that for some, baseball and other sports are what saved their sanity. Also accurate is the fact that there were some people from Hawai'i that were sent to Topaz, the prejudice they faced, and the heavy loss of life suffered by the Go For Broke 442nd.I was one of the extras in this movie and having done a three-year project developing lesson plans on Topaz for the Japanese-American National Museum, I can tell you that the director and producer were careful to remain as true to details as possible. Included in the many extras, were people who were actually incarcerated. They said the set was so well-done that if they didn't know better, they would have thought they were back in camp again."
1,Killer on Loose in NY Hospital,"I chose First Cut because it was a Literary Guild Selection. It turned out to be a disappointing choice for me. The author is obviously knowledgable about hospitals and medical terminology, but it was overdone and overwritten. The pace was frantic and I doubt any human could realistically continue to function as our protagonist, Ev, did in thise book. She is a resident who is a combination flawless physician, marvelous teacher, excellent detective, and sexually appealing to all men in this book. That is just too much woman for me. I began skimming about l/3 way through this tome and was relieved to finish. The lengthly explanation by our heroine of how, why and by whom the crimes were committed was just more (pun intended) overkill."
5,Can't put down!,Can't put down the book and it gets exciting every chapter. I'm looking forward to more books of Ms. Robinson.
1,Dust can almost get away from this one,"I bought this because I wanted to start getting bugs out of my house without having to get so close to them.Most bugs have strong enough grips to avoid being inhaled by this toy, so it has been completely useless to me."
4,Works for me!,"I was worried after reading the other reviews that this would not have enough power, but it picks up spiders (my main reason for buying it) just fine from carpets, walls, sinks and tubs. I've also picked up a big beetle which I thought I would have problems with since they grab carpet so hard. I have the setting at high suction. It would be nice if high was low, and there was more reserve if I need it, but so far, so good. Easy to remove bugs from the vacuum by just shaking them out outdoors. Maybe other users had the magnifying trap door closed? Then it really wouldn't work. These are Colorado bugs--maybe they're wimpier than other regions' bugs."
3,smaller than I expected,"I ordered this to wear on a necklace with other ""bootie type charms"" I have representing my 4 children. When I received it I realized that it was too small next to the others I have.It is very cute and would work wonderfully on a charm bracelet or on its own as a delicate necklace charm."
4,Not exactly the Burritos,"As a long term fan of all Byrd related material, I knew the link to this was very tenuous, but with 23 tracks it seemed a good sample of what the group had become.This is more an introduction to John Beland than the Burritos, but since they've changed line-ups so often it's a valid addition to their history.Beland excels at sad songs, so it's not a record to listen to if you're depressed, but at any other time the feelings will draw you in and leave you wanting to hear more.My favourite tracks are ""Another Shade of Grey"", a great example of simplicity with 1 voice and 1 guitar on different speakers, ""I swear I Don't Miss Her Anymore"" & ""Why Must The Ending Always Be So Sad"""
2,Disappointment,"First the good news: 78 minutes of music on one CD. Clean sound from original tapes. Nice booklet giving a history and background to the recordings. And yes, the purity and nuance of the vocal harmonies that make the Everlys so wonderful. It is the lousy choice of most of the songs and hokey arrangements that sink this CD. I am sure that Don and Phil lament the circumstances that resulted in these recordings. I listened to the CD a second time to confirm my embarassment for the Everlys and the disc now sits in a used CD bin. Want a really special Everly's compilation ? Check out Devoted To You/Love Songs on Varese Sarabande."
3,For Die-Hard Everly Fans,"Some pretty good songs surrounded by too many mediocre songs. Sound quality is very good and the Everlys do the best they can with some less than great material. Buy it to get hold of some really good tracks ( Jezebel, My Gal Sal, Chloe ) that just don't show up anywhere else. Tracks like ""Mention My Name In Sheboygan"" , well, they could have done a lot better."
1,Not Better than Nothing,"I purchased this book unseen as a Sunday School resource. Since receiving it, I've spent quite a bit of time considering whether or not to keep it, on the basis of it being better than nothing, and I've finally decided that it is not. ""Plays"" is a grossly overstated misrepresentation of the contents. They are not plays at all -- no attempt is made towards dialogue, characters or action. It is simply the words of the text divided up among a couple of readers. In terms of making the gospels interesting and accessible to young readers, one would be much better off getting a simple book like ""The Family Story Bible"" and letting the children make up the plays themselves. Really disappointing."
5,Creative Lessons on Judaism,"Rabbi Goldberger creatively finds lessons Jews can all learn from ants.Alternative title: ""Big Lessons from Little giANTS: The ANTidote for Laziness; ANTibodies against Spiritual Diseases; How to ANTicipate and prepare in this ANTeroom for the Glorious Eternal World to Come."""
2,Only 1 copy of 2 volume set was sent,The second volume was not sent as per what the advertisement stated. I would like the second copy shipped to me as well.
3,My 2 Year Old Loves It,"My 2and1/2 year old has read this book and it has sparked her interest in becoming potty trained. She now wears pullups, which is progress. Sparking interest is really all this book is intended to do. We read the book at least twice a week, including in the bathroom. My 15 month also likes looking at the pictures, too. I give it 3 stars for very good."
2,Too Many Other Good BB Books--Don't Waste Time,"The new BB baby board books have been marketed pretty well, targeting the very youngest readers (or pre-readers), but do not be fooled by these new titles. The drawings are boring, lifeless, empty, and simple. Much to the dismay of a huge Berenstain Bears fan, I have to advise that you NOT choose these books. There are too many other GOOD Berenstain Bears books to waste your time or money on these titles. There are a number of other board books and pre-school books by the Berenstains if you like the bears --- check out the board book versions of Inside Outside Upside Down or Old Hat New Hat. You might also look at titles like Yike Yike Where's My Trike or The BB In Big Bear City. The only disadvantage is that the words/stories are not going to help a kid to give up his/her pacifier or learn to like a car seat. So there IS still SOME validity to this series."
2,An over-the-hill writer still tried to cash in for nothing!,"Boring,flat,tasteless are the words I'd like to give to Follett since he drained up from THE DANGEROUS FORTUNE. I think the writer got some brain damage after that, 'cause what we have seen is a totally different Follett after that. Like J. Archer, both should be retired from writing and shouldn't bother their old fans furthermore to ruin the good memories. This book was so flat like the junk-car- graveyard's scene with all flat tires littered around. The sperming around scenario is such a bore that I'd rather read the more interesting sheep-or-cow cloning news"
2,"John Case does it better.....try ""the genesis code""","If you're into genetic engineering/cloning, Follett's book is alright, but there's a much better one - - ""the genesis code"" will nail you to your chair and hold your interest much more than Follett's latest offering.."
2,"John Case does it much better in ""The Genesis Code""","I THOUGHT I would like Follett's latest offering better than I actually did. However, after reading John Case's FIRST novel, ""The Genesis Code,"" I would suggest that Mr. Follett go back to the drawing board and come up with a more interesting plot and more specific details on what is quickly becoming every author's favorite plot-line: genetic engineering.After ""Code,"" this book falls way short of capturing the reader's interest or giving the reader much in the way of heros/heroines to actually root for. I usually love Follett, but this time, he has lost his DNA-way.If you are interested in cloning and its potential consequences, you will be well served to check out ""The Genesis Code."" Trust me on this one"
2,"Running out of ideas, are you? Mr.Follett.","My time could have been better spent if I had watched Rikki Lake go on about ""Get your hands off my man."" I must admit it started out very interesting, but somewhere in the middle this thriller turned into a half baked sci-fi with no imagination. Became too preachy about the consequences of experimental bio-medical research without any scientific factual bases. I quess I couldn't blame the author too much. I am sure he had to meet the deadline given by his publisher"
2,Flat characters and Predictable plot,"A disappointment considering the author. The characters came off as flat, boring and (worst of all) stupid. Liberal bias and author commentary run rampant throughout this book and the bad guys (white males) are evil without reason. Only two things redeem this book: an interesting look at the nature vs. nurture debate and some very good chapters where an innocent man is abused by the police and inmates. The rest of the book was painful"
2,Very poor job,"I have read a few other of Follett's works, and have generally been satisfied with his writing. This book, however, is a major exception. The characters had no depth, the story was completely convoluted, and the writing was cliched. Further, as a psychology researcher, I was outraged at Mr. Follett's description of the research process in the book, as there is absolutely no way that a psychology researcher would ever be allowed to engage in the protocols that he created for this work. Please, do yourself a favor, and don't waste your time with this book."
3,"Flat, even silly characters.","The plot was interesting, in theory. However, the flat, even silly characters spoiled the book. After hearing of the popularity of this author, I finally tried one of his books. Extremely doubtful that I shall do so again."
3,third twin by Ken Follett,"Good book, interesting subject matter. However, book was a little slow in spots. Also felt the mom character of Dr. Gen ie was unnecessary as she was written. Either should have developed her more or just mention she was in a home at most.Book worth the read."
3,So-So,"This book was okay, but nothing special. It was very predictable. I'm more partial to Mr. Follett's WWI and WWII books."
3,Did not age well,"The book is a fair entertainment but has many loose ends. Time has passed and therefore making backup in floppy disks is one of the minor signs of age that shows. That aside, it is not boring but would greatly bennefit from a new shortenned updated edition"
5,It kept me up ALL night. Totally gripping,"I would like to congratulate Ken Follet to introducing me to the Thriller style books. It was the first adult/thriller book I read and since have read other Ken Follet books and books by James Patterson, Sidney Sheldon and Tom Clancy. Origionally it was the cover which led me to the book and then the Librarian Recomended it. I started reading it and didn't stop until 2 O'Clock in the morning. Only Three books have done that (Harry Potter and the Philosphers Stone, Kiss The Girls and Notes on a big country) There were lots of unexpected twists in the book."
1,Just Awful!,"What happened to Ken Follett? His earlier works, such as ""The Key to Rebecca"" and ""Eye of the Needle,"" were well-crafted thrillers. ""The Third Twin"" is sophomorically episodic with every character as stereotypically painted as imaginable. The novel has little suspense, no interesting characterizations, with foolish plot devices and juvenile twists abound. Ken must be simply churning out the pulp to make a few bucks. Save your money."
2,Save your money.,"I haven't read anything else by Ken Follett, and based on this book, I don't plan to. The story line was unbelievable, the plot full of holes, and I didn't care about the characters. Don't waste your money buying this book."
2,A disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Ken Follett's work, but in this novel, his superb narrative skills seem to have eluded him. The characters--primary and secondary- are basically one-dimensional (and that one dimension is repeated and replayed often). We have a host of supposedly intelligent, if not brilliant people, who seem to learn nothing from their experiences. The story is a good one, but I have come to expect much more from the author of ""A Dangerous Fortune,"" ""Pillars of the Earth,"" and so many great novels."
4,None,"This book is very thrilling, with good main characters, and particularly good villains. There are a few notable plotholes, but the fast pace, good writing, and notable characters make up for it. All in all I think this is a great book, with a few minor flaws."
1,it went on and on and on ........,"Pass on this book unless every thing else has been used for toilet paper or fire starter.No it's not that bad but boring and never seems to end. Had potential with the ideaand tied together nicely, just too many clichés, and was a real let down."
1,complete waste of my time!,"ughh - since I wasted two weeks of my pre-sleep bedtime reading time,the least I could do was waste another five minutes writing this shortreview. I can't believe I didn't put this book down after the first50 pages! ughh. This was my first (and last) foray into Ken Follett's works.I thought this was written by a fifteen year old.Characters acted stupid, reacted stupidly, and the cliches throughoutthis book are laughable. Again, I can't believe I read this or thatthis book was even published.I read 15 minutes of a new Steven King novel to ""wash"" all thememories of this one away."
2,This Book is a Shadow of What Ken Follett Has Done,"A friend turned me on to Ken in high school and I have read every single book that he has ever written. I loved them all. Pillars of the Earth, Night Over Water, Eye of the Needle, Man from St. Petersburg, even Dangerous Fortune.For some reason though, his books have been detiorating. A Place Called Freedom was a boring romance (disguised as historical) novel and now this. Follett is a master at making us understand his characters thought processes and he draws them out with such precision. But in this case, the characters were shallow, the book predictable.If you're looking for quality Follett, don't read his recent stuff. Stick with his classics. Start with Eye of the Needle."
3,Good....but Follett has done better!,"Not quite 'Pillars of the Earth' or 'A Dangerous Fortune', but it was an entertaining read. The book had some surprising twists and the characters were quite believable. It did get a bit descriptive at times, but overall it kept pretty focused on the adventure at hand. It does get you to think about what has and is being done in genetics research....creepy! It's a quick and easy read!"
1,Don't bother reading this. Wait for the made-for-TV movie.,"I wish I had checked these reviews before I picked up the book.The jacket description promises a ""contemporary thriller""but the book delivers far less. Maybe Follett was trying to turn a quick dollar on the book and sell the rights to TV, but ""The Third Twin"" delivers all the sizzle of ""Brenda Starr."" The plot is completly predictable; the characters, one dimensional; and Follett's political agenda becomes tiresome. (Actually ""Brenda Starr"" is better--most of the readers care what happens to Brenda.) If you want to read a good book, I suggest you forget this one and try Follett's ""Pillars of the Earth."""
3,ONE OF FOLLET'S WORST NOVELS,"The basic premise of ""The Third Twin"" is disturbingly interesting because the subject of genetic engineering is so much in vogue. Yet in spite of a promising beginning, the book's plot eventually settles itself into a course of absolute predictability. One hopes that in the near future Ken Follet will regain his formidable storytelling skills that have produced unforgettable novels such as ""Pillars of the Earth"" and ""The Eye of the Needle.&quot"
2,Interesting...but wait for the paperback,"The premise of this book is quite exciting, and the dust jacket blurbs will make you pick it up. Alas, Follett does not seem to do all that could have been done with the scenario he created. Much of the dialogue seems mechanical, and it's interesting that Follett frequently uses the odd construction: ""Jeannie said: '....'"" to have dialogue, which adds to the detached feel of the character interaction. While Follett's premise of a misuse of genetic engineering is interesting, he cops out on the answer to the ""nature vs. nurture"" argument that the lead charracter is trying to answer. This is worthwhile poolside reading, but wait for the paperback or tv movie"
3,mediocre,"The premise of the story is quite interesting, and it could havemade for a very enjoyable novel. Unfortunately, Follett's executionis mediocre at best. Much of the dialog between characters is painfullycontrived, and the proliferation of clones becomes laughableafter a while (thus reducing their dramatic impact). It's quiteapparent that Follett knows very little about the Internet, giventhe awkward, outdated way in which it's used throughout the book.It's equally apparent that Follett doesn't know much about the realAmerican universities that are mentioned in the book. These errors,while not central to the plot, become very distracting. The lackof research is in stark contrast to other authors in the same genre.Bottom line: Wait for the paperback. Better yet, borrow it fromthe library, if you must read it at all. It's hard to believe thesame author who wrote Eye of the Needle penned this uninspiredpiece."
3,OK but not more then that,"This is my second Ken Follett (my first was ""paper money"" which was very good). It is a bit like seeing a slick Holywood action movie, the time passes and it is good entertainment and there is ever some insight of some of the characters but on the whole it is pritty empty and manipulative. I enjoyed paper money so much I am not going to give up but if this was the first KF novel I read I am not sure I would want to try another."
2,disappointing follett,I have read every book by Ken Follett andd this is a great disappointment. The characters were very wooden and shallow and the end was very predictable and trite. I will continue to read Follett in hopes that this book was a bad fluke!
1,Has someone stolen Ken Follett's name?,"I've read everything that Ken Follett has written; Pillars of the Earth is my favorite. No, Eye of the Needle. No...you get the idea. He used to write such interesting stories. It was as if a beginning novelist wrote this one and he let that person place his name on the cover. Even the dialogue lacked when compared to his previous work. I beg him to write another great spy novel!"
3,"Third Twin is Ok, but not a great read.","It is too predictable. Maybe I have read so many of his works that I can predict or maybe this one just lacks the excitement and terrific writing techniques Mr. Follet is so good at. The characterization is blatant rather than subtle and subversive, making everything a foregone conclusion before it even happens..third Twin is definitely not his best work."
3,"Been done before, and better","A young scientist studying links in genes to the potential for criminality comes across two men, identical down to their DNA, raised separately and born on different days. As she investigates, becoming more involved with the law abiding twin, Steve, she discovers that there may be a third twin still at large, who may be guilty of raping one of her friends.This starts off well, as an interesting yarn, but rapidly goes downhill, especially when the words 'perfect soldier' leapt out at you. Right after that the story falls flat. Clones and killing machines have been done before, and combining them doesn't make any difference. The text is bogged down in unnecessary details, such as obsessive details about how the female lead dresses, and the ending is decidedly flat.Follett can do amazing thrillers and fascinating historical fiction, but this isn't one of them. Aeroplane reading, but not much more. (It gets three stars for being interesting at the start.)"
3,A thriller about the genetic causes of criminality,"I think this book as a great plot and many unespected twists and I really loved it. But sometimes is too focused of unimportant particulars like descriptions that are not interesting for the reader, transforming some of its parts in a kind of boring lecture."
2,"Hey, Steve. Is that you or your evil twin? I can't tell","Ken Follett's ""The Third Twin"" gave away the plot from the first chapter and kept giving away the next plot twist way too soon. No surprises. Supposedly very intelligent people making incredible stupid mistakes. You would think that once you suspected your boyfriend was one of a set of identical clone's, had your life threatened by one, and your best friend raped by one, that you would figure out a way to ""certify"" the good one. Well Jeannie, doesn't until she's almost raped for the SECOND time. She goes to incredible lengths to obtain her prized list of clone names on diskette and hands it to her boyfriend saying ""Be careful, it's the only copy"". I think the first thing any reasonable person would do with a ""one of kind"" data disk is make a backup, copy it to an email and send it off to a few friends, right? All in all a weak story."
3,"ok, not Follett's best","While this was a letdown compared to Pillars of the Earth, it was still exiting and fastpace compared to a Grisham book."
2,"Follett fouls out with ""The Third Twin""","As an avid reader of adventure and mystery, Ken Follett has written some of my favorite books - but this one disappoints in a big way. The character of Jeannie Ferrami was one of the worst portraits of a smart woman I have encountered EVER! The plot was completely ludicrous - the writing amateurish and the characters cardboard. Mr. Follett - has someone cloned you...but forgot to add the writing gene? This book cannot be written by the same man who wrote ""The key to Rebecca"" or ""The eye of the needle""."
2,Ken is folleting on his face,I checked the book out at the library. Suggest the library look for a refund. Has Mr. Follet joined Dean Koontz? Crank 'em out with no thought other than $$$$. A major disappointment.
2,if u've got time to while away go for it,though this was the first book i read by this author and on this subject but this book failed to spring out any surprises...it seemed it be nothing but a hackyneed banal trite thin plot abt a perfect woman and a perfect man....who turns out to be a testtubt baby having 8 identical twins...and in the end they good wins over the evil and so the plot ends...was like reading a fairy tail with genitic modifications....hardly one's idea of a thriller...i guess this hat to be put in the childrens category not in the mysteries group.
2,Third Time's Not A Charm,This was highly recommended to me. I didn't like it. Different than Follett's other works but I found that I didn't care about the characters fate and I also found it a bit confusing at times.
2,Two stories too many?,Cassette VersionI enjoyed Night over Water and the Key to Rebecca and was really disappointed by this. Perhaps Follett should stick to WWII. I listened to the audio version and when I had to switch it to side two I wondered why I was wasting my time and stopped.Two things really irritated me. The first was the stereotypical insensitive doctor collecting rape evidence. The second was the reader's abrasive accent.I found I wasn't enjoying it and popped another cassette in the tape player. The 2 stars are giving it the benefit of the doubt as I only listened to one side of one tape. Otherwise it would have received 1.
3,Ken's greatest disappointment,"I've read every Ken Follett book ever written. I cant wait until October for his new book. However, the 3rd Twin was average. I did read it completely and without any extended breaks. It was too predictable. Come on Ken. This is not how you became my hero."
2,Must have been written for TV,"Have enjoyed some of Ken Follet's other work, i.e. Eye of the Needle, but this novel felt as though it had been intentionally written as a TV soap. It was thick and syrupy! It follows ""A Dangerous Fortune"" in it's story telling style. Ken - cut down on the F word, and use the skills you were given...."
2,Another made-for-TV novel....,"YAWN...isn't this cloning idea gone a bit too long I mean, why can't Follett think of something original? The characters are two-dimensional and the plot is cliched...the whole book writes like a movie script...a bad movie script. The heroine Jeanne Ferrami is your typical female-scientist-with-looks-and-an-attitude and her lover boy is as wooden as they come,good-hearted but wooden. Anyway, I give this book a 4 since it's readable, ,the plot is not too stupid and it has a reasonable amount of suspense to keep me turning those pages."
2,WHAT A PITY IT WAS A FOLLET'S BOOK,"The reviews tell it all. It is very strange that after ""Pillars of the Earth"" Follet writes such a weak book. Characters, plot, everything so simplistic. We have the impression that it was writen with the sole purpose of selling it to the movies. Very disappointing."
2,"Interesting idea, but plot peters out by mid book.","The concept of this novel is an interesting one, and involves cloning of embryos and misuse of IV fertilization. The plot is intriguing and captivating in the first half of the book, but Follett loses steam (and probably interest) there onwards. Not one of his better novels, but it may do well as a made-for-TV movie. I should have waited for it to come out in paperback, and read it on a plane"
2,Sharkey,Can't believe this was required reading in a German high school English class. What is that focus?Sensationalism in pulp. Come on Ken.
1,Did not receive the Third Twin,"Once again, I did not receive the hard cover Third Twin, ordered in October, however I have been billed for this, how can you help me?"
4,makes me wonder about my twin...,"Excellent book! You won't be able to put this one down! The genetic and scientific detail is enough to make it sound, but not so much that the average reader gets lost in the mumbo-jumbo.It's a great read, but make sure that you don't have to do anything else, because you won't want to put this book down until you are done!"
2,Follett's trip downhill continues.,"Many here have complained about Follett's decline since PILLARS OF THE EARTH, and I agree. I bought this book because of Follett's name, and regretted it. Follett has also taken up the Michael Crichton-chic penchant for left-wing commentary (my favorite is when one of the leads says: 'These guys are really bad. They're against gun control.' Never mind that gun control hasn't been an issue in the book...a pure cheap shot). As well, the characters and situations in this book are simplistic and unconvincing. I did enjoy one sequence at the end involving clone substitution and impersonation, but that was the high point of an otherwise bad book."
2,This Book has Average Written all over it,"I did not enjoy this one as much as I did main of his other books. I guess I did not think it grabbed me at the start like many of his works. He always produces a decent book, and for someone who wants a book that is somewhat interesting, easy and simple, this will fit the bill. If you are looking for something more he just did not get to that next level. The story is an inventive one and he just about pulls it off. I don't know why I didn't think this a real gripping boo, maybe it was just that all the work that went into it, the character development, plot, etc was just a little average and blah. I would read this one over a Grisham or Turow, but there are also much better out there."
2,"Ken Follett, won't you please come home?","Having read many of Mr. Follett's books (Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca), I expected great things. What a disappointment! He must have phoned this one in--or maybe someone else wrote this book. It would make a great beach read if you can stand the improbable female characters, wooden dialogue, stupid mistakes by smart people. The premise is given away by the title so there is little intrigue. And the characters remain inconsistent throughout. Also, the academic atmosphere is bogus and stereotypical. And to add insult to injury, the salary quoted for the protagonist, given her degrees and reputation, is way out of line--no decent university would be able to attract her for a mere $30,000. I had to check the publication date on this book when I read that!An OK read if you aren't too particular. It moved quickly, thank God, and I am on to other titles in my extensive To Be Read pile!"
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book. Really.Unfortunately, I couldn't bring myself to care about the one-dimensional characters. Combined with extremely difficult-to-believe plot twists (Petagon security can't stop someone from leaving the building? I think not), this book was uninteresting and not engaging.In the end, I kept feeling that I had better stories of ""government-clones-perfect-soldier"" elsewhere. It seemed familiar from beginning to end."
2,Gagana Samoa: A Samoan Language,Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless the audio cassette is available. It's impossible to try and learn without audio.
3,Book without CD,The book is great but should have a CD to help in pronunciation. The way the book is written there are pictures of a CD at the end of each chapter for practice. In other words it appears that the book was designed to have a CD included. However no CD came with the purchase.
5,Excellent,"All of John Stott's books are helpful, practical, and insightful. I regularly refer to this series of commentaries and always learn new things."
5,John Stott's commentary on 2 Timothy,"John Stott's commentary on the 2nd Letter to Timothty (2 Timothy) is very clearly written, typical of his Gospel commentaries."
2,"Very dry, no description",The book did not seem to catch my interest. words and phrases kept being repeated which started to get anoying at times. although all this can being explained that it is almost the exact translation of the 12 tablets which made up this epic.
1,Zombies can sing,"Adriano Celentano was great in the early 60s, when he was part of the italian musical revolution. He was one of the first who dared melting italian lyrics with rock'n'roll music.Everything he did after that initial golden period is really cheesy. He even developed a ridicolous messianic-philosophical attitude that unfortunately Italian televisions are always happy to encourage.Like in all the CDs he recorded in last 20 years, even in this one you can find commonplace lyrics and cheesy melodies."
5,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!,"Aveeno is new to me and I have tried a few of their products and loved them all so I knew this would be a good buy. What I didn't expect is how easily it removes makeup! I recently got a new mascara which is great but a really hard one to remove. I usually have to wash my face then wipe my eyes with cotton and makeup remover to shift it. This cleanser however, obliterated it so fast it amazed me! Infact it has rendered my make up remover useless!The other thing I love is that it makes my skin feel really clean and fresh and my skin looks great after using it - even before I moisturise.I have very pale skin so I suffer the dreaded dark circles which makes me look tired, but this really does make your skin look radiant. Thanks Aveeno - I just love this!"
1,All DVDs Received Damaged!,"My family and I ordered multiple seasons for my Daughter, they were wrapped like they were new but -- Season 1 looked like it was water-damaged- Season 2 wouldn't play at all (same as #1)- Season 3 - we didn't even open after examining the others.- Season 4 scratched badly, would skipI'm not sure where Amazon picked up these sets from, but it is pretty bad.I've setup return."
2,Not a true James Bond theme songs compilation,"This compilation is far inferior to the awesome collection in the album ""Best of 007 Bond: James Bond"" 40th Anniversary Edition, which on one single CD has 22 songs, including all the beloved theme songs we grew up (and old) with. That set, also available here on Amazon, costs less than half of this POS here, which is expensive and filled with crappy songs. Get the other album."
5,The most complete collection of original bond themes.,"This music collection stands out among all other bond theme albums, simply because all of the tracks are performed by the original title artists just as they were in the films, no re-done Bond themes here, just the real thing with added extras such as the Thunderball Suite in its entirety and radio advertising spots for three Bond films."
5,007 Music is Forever!,"The James Bond 30th Anniversary Collection 2-CD Set is one of the most prized posessions in my 007 collection. The first CD contains all of the original title theme songs from Dr. No to Licence to Kill. All the famoua artists are here, including Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Nancy Sinatra, Paul McCartney, Carly Simon, Rita Coolidge, Duran Duran, a-ha, Gladys Knight and many more.The real treat however is the second CD. This is the only James Bond CD to this date that contains these rare 007 tunes. Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (the original for Thunderball) is included sung by both Dionne Warwick and Shirley Bassey. Radio Spots for Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and more are also included.This is perhaps the greatest collection of James Bond music. A real treat!"
4,They're not all here here!,"Pretty amazing that no one has mentioned that there is one movie that's not represented. In fact countless reviewers have claimed that every movie from Dr No onward is on this collection up thru the release date. Wrong. Once again the compilers have ignored 1983's ""Never Say Never Again"". The Michael Legrand soundtrack was a disappointment but Lani Hall's theme song was decent.And don't say it's not a true Bond movie. It starred Sean Connery as James Bond for crying out loud! And it grossed $160 million dollars. Just a different company and producer, that's all."
4,"Great, BUT...","EVERY song here, in one way or another, is an all-time classic. This package includes the 007 themes from DR. NO (1962) to LICENSE TO KILL (1989). However, I'd suggest skipping this seemingly incredible comp and going instead for the 2-CD set of the SAME NAME! Disc 1 on that contains the 16 themes in chronological sequence (which this, strangely, doesn't), while Disc 2 contains a LOT of previously-unreleased tracks that can be found nowhere else."
5,As Perfect As We Are Ever Likely To Get!,"For the fans of the James Bond movies, this CD is a must! The selections are marvelous and bring back many fond memories of sitting in movie theaters and thrilling to Bond's adventures. When you hear the ""007 Theme"" you are immediately whisked back to the exciting fight in the gypsy camp in ""From Russia With Love"". Shirley Bassey still sends a thrill up your spine in ""Goldfinger"" when she warns not to be captured in his ""web of sin!""Composer John Barry who wrote most of what is heard on these CDs always managed to capture the essence of Bond. To hear all of these songs again is an absolute delight and the liner notes included are very informative.Cuddle up with your favorite ""Bond girl"", pour the martinis [or chardonnay if you will!], put on this CD and enjoy!"
4,"Nice set, though strangely arranged","Released in 1992, this has themes from each of the Bonds up thru 1989's License To Kill. (So nothing from any of the Pierce Brosnan films.) What's great about this collection is its completeness. They find space to include a couple of the fine John Barry instrumentals: the wonderful theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and a characteristic theme from From Russia With Love which you'll recognize the second you hear it. (Frankly I might buy this disk for the On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme alone.) There's also a Dionne Warwick song from Thunderball, which previously had not appeared on CD.What's weird about this collection is that the tracks are not in chronological order. Jarring. For my own use I take these tracks and re-burn them onto a CD in chrono order. I don't understand what the producers were thinking when they set the track order of this collection.But it's a good to have these tracks. It's a nice set."
2,Manson's Oldham,"Fan-leaning acoustic EP doesn't offer much past an intimate evening with emo-dracula. A few renditions feel worthy, while the majority drags longer then it should."
3,"nice ring, but","i like the ring very much..just the right size. i had it for about 3 months, and wore most days. One day I looked down and saw that one of the emeralds had fallen out. I had expected the ring to last longer."
5,Thought I'd never replace this book...,"I bought this book over twenty years ago, and I loved it because the photos are very helpful and inspiring. If I don't see a picture of the recipe, I might not be enthused to try it.A few years ago, my home flooded out, and I lost over 95% of my library, this book included. Worse, I couldn't remember its name to save my life!! But I practically screamed in delight when I found this book on Amazon while sorting through a huge search of Chinese cookbooks. I've made many of the dishes that are in this book, but the Chinese sausage and sticky rice is my all-time favorite recipe. And I couldn't remember how to make it!I understand the previous reviewer's comment about the length of preparation, however, I've created more than a few short cuts that work. This is a great cookbook and is quite authentic, per my friends from Taiwan and Mainland China."
5,What a beautiful Gift!,"I have two friends fighting cancer and am always sending cards, small mailable gifts,crosswords and tiny books etc. in the mail for encouragement, which is what I am usingthese cards for as well. Max Lucado is a GIFTED author and beautiful Christian man andPastor. I have read many of his over 90 publications and this is yet another. I willpurchase another set for myself...they are a great & quick 'go to' when one needs somequick comfort during rough times and can easily be tucked into an envelope and carriedin a purse or pocket."
3,Digital frame,"This was a gift to a friend. I didn't see it for several months, and when I did get to see it, I was more than a little disappointed. The pictures were dark and had a very red tint. Since I'm not familiar with the operation of the frame (I just ordered it from Amazon and trusted from the reviews that it would be nice), I'm not sure if the problem stemmed from the digital frame, from the memory card or perhaps there was some kind of adjustment that could have been made on the frame itself to correct the color. Since I gave it as a gift, I was too embarrassed to point out that the color was awful, and my friend didn't mention it either."
2,Disneyland of the Gods is Hogwash with a Sense of Humour,"Keel tries to explain many of the earth's mysteries with tales of UFO's, Sea Serpents, Big Hairy Monsters, and other anonomalies; however, DSNLNDOTGODS borders on the same, unfounded lunacy as von Daniken's horrible ""Chariots of the Gods.""The only thing that makes this book worthwile is Keel's absurdly Fortean sense of humour. Sure, the book is plagued with faulty reasoning, but God, the premise is just funny. Sinks falling from the sky!I think it's funny, but pretty much the ramblings of a guy who wants everything to be the result of UFO's, or extradimensional beings."
4,Lighten up people!,"Just as John Keel always makes referance to, the true believers in the ""bug eyed greys"" are a humourless lot. And anyone who does not share the reasoning that all ufo related activity is accountable to our benevolent space beings is crucified. If you truly READ this book with an OPEN mind perhaps you can see what Keel is getting at, that paranormal activities are related and a big part of THIS planets history. And, he stesses that a good number of incidents were probably only real in the witnesses MIND. This book is not recommended for the quasi-religious followers of the wonderous space people and the fans of OBVIOUS fiction writers like Whitley Strieber and Bud Hopkins."
1,Misdirection,"A look at John Keel's body of work shows a thoughtful man and a writer of speculation. Disneyland of the Gods is just his take on the old Fortean idea that mankind is property, or, at best, simply interacting with other realities that poke through into our space - time. This is just better speculation but is not based on much. We don't have to rethink anything. There are too many good reports with multiple witnesses and radar to conclude all the data simply needs a new frame of reference.Although somewhat entertaining, this lightweight book does little to bring the conversation about strange phenomena forward. If anything, it distracts and misdirects."
2,A disappointment,A long ago death holds the key to the rivalry between the heads of two cruiseline companies.Known as the 'Queen of the Seas' Adriana Falcone has taken over the company from her late husband after he is kidnapped and brutally murdered. She is determined to make her late husband's dream come true. Thorne Weston is just as determined to stop her.The rivalry turns to attraction as the two are forced to work together and become reluctant partners. But somebody is trying to kill Adriana and Thorne has many secrets of his own.Ports of Call was a interesting book and quick read but with not much substance. I found myself wishing the end would come and found the romance between Adriana and Thorne to be second rate and uneventful. I recommend the reader pass on this book.
2,Disappointing,"This book started off very well. I enjoyed the rivalry between the two protagonists and looked forward to seeing Thorne's defences crumble as he falls under the spell of Adriana.Unfortunately, I was not to be rewarded in that respect. As the book progresses, there are moments where you begin to wonder whether or not Adriana and Thorne are meant to be together, which makes the rather rushed finale even harder to believe. I am usually willing to suspend belief to some extent when reading a romance, but there has to be an element of believability for me to immerse myself in the story. The final scenes aboard the yacht were laughable and the writing dwindled to amateurish standards. I was denied a satisfying ending, which is a requirement in any good romance.Won't be reading other books by this author."
1,"Hammer broke, Awful customer service",I owned one of these hammers. The handle broke off under normal service. Estwing required me to return it to their factory at my expense. Estwing refused to replace it saying it had been 'abused'. Nor would they return my still broken but usable hammer citing liability! Estwing has the worst customer service of any tool company. Do not buy!!!
3,"Adorable, but generally not worth it","We got several adorable baby bathrobes as gifts, and we almost never use any of them. Babies get chilled very quickly after a bath and the last thing you want to be doing is fighting to get their little arms into sleeves when they are freezing and unhappy. We mostly put them on to take pictures in them, then didn't use them much after that. Invest in some nice thick hooded towels instead - they are quick, easy and get the job done!"
3,Cute but colors run,"I love this bath robe, but when I washed it the red dye ran onto the yellow fabric. Not so cute anymore."
3,This is good for small babies.,This is a very cute bathrobe for small babies but as soon as they are about 15 pounds the arms are kind of small. It is adorable for a newborn though.
2,Don't like the knife,"For $30, the set felt light; worst, the knife is not one piece, you can clearly see the gap between the blade and handle. Also, the logo on the knife is laser/chemical edged, but the logo on the other pieces is mechanically pressed. I will definitely avoid anything WMF in the future."
5,Fantastic Sheets,"I've tried several other high-threadcount, lower price sheets from other sources. These feel much softer and substantial immediately. We are very happy with them."
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed with these sheets. I had recently purchased the Regal 300TC Sateen sheets in twin and queen and they were great!! I thought these would feel even better but they didn't. Coming out of the bag they felt good but after a washing they felt like any other cheap sheets. I'll never buy these again at ANY price.
1,"Elegance 600-Thread-Count King Hemstitch Sheet Set, Bone",worst then parcel 180 thread bed sheets. These sheets do not feel as good as 180 tread parcel bed sheets.
1,Disappointed!! Not soft as my other 350 TC.,I've bought so many things from Amazon before but this is my first review. I have to get it out of my system and warn others.I bought this set because of all the reviews here. I got it and washed it. The sheets are stiff. Not as soft as my 350 TC. No hotel will use this kind of sheets. It's very bad and I'd return it if I haven't washed it. I expected a lot more from 600 TC. I wish I've gone to stores to actually feel it before buy it. Now I know. Best of luck.
2,Not Egyptian Cotton,"Even though it says it is Egyptian Cotton these sheets are not..they are actually ""elegant like egyptian cotton"". They are rougher than any of my other 600 thread sheets. They are not at all what they were supposed to be."
4,I am pleased,"The sheets are soft. Fitted is a little large for my 15"" mattress but it is made to fit 18"" deep. The pillow cases are perfect for my standard pillows. Personally, I would have preferred a sheet that feels cooler when getting into bed but I have never had 600 thread count before so they probably are all heavier and warmer."
2,Disappointed - no way it's 600 thread count,"I was excited to receive the sheet set and made our bed with it right the way. But the sheets feel rough, more like a 200-thread count than the 600 it claimed. We've several 350- and 400-thread count sheets, and they're MUCH softer than this. So I thought maybe washing them will soften them, but no luck. Instead, the fitted sheet shrinks a bit, and it's now very difficult to get it back on the mattress!"
3,Ok,"They are still soft, not nearly as soft as they used to be. Maybe I washed them wrong I don't know."
2,Quality sheets...but only for a while..,"I got these sheets a while ago and started using them on my bed a month ago. They appear to have great wear and quality for a while. However, after a month of use and a few washings, I've started to notice a tiny amount of 'piling'. 600-thread sheets should never 'pile'. My other 600-thread counts sheets don't. Right now, it's only a small amount, but the fact that they are already piling means the problem will continue. While these sheets are nice and sturdy, they aren't the quality they claim to be."
2,2 sets defective,"First set had a poorly-sewn seam, so sent that back. Replacement set had several stains on each piece. Too bad, they look beautiful on photo!"
1,disappointed...,"I, too, had to return these sheets. The description clearly says fits mattresses up to 18 inches. The package states 15 inches. Very disappointed."
5,Quick Delivery,It was really good to get the right charger shipped in 3 days time at one fourth the price I would have paid at the store.Would recommend very strongly
1,"Not a how-to; more a collection of short-short stories, none of which are ""joy""ous","And, if this is an illustration of the ""joy"" of writing sex, I would hate to see an illustration of the ""horror"" or writing sex.One of the short-shorts in the version I purchased of this book details the experience of a male gas station clerk being highly aroused when another male enters his gas station and rapes him in the back room. Is this a sex scene worthy of a story to be sold as literature, or is it a transcribed version of something someone saw at a pay site on the Internet? Do we really want to be sending a message to the public that rape is an acceptable, exciting form of sexual intercourse? I can think of several victims I know who would not appreciate that, one of whom was killed by her attacker."
4,UNIQUELY EXPRESSED.,"The way I read it, this is a story on how to write a story. If I'm wrong, I stand corrected. But I thought that this book was very easy to understand, and interesting also. So if you like to learn how to write a sex story, or even like to read one, this is the book for you; I couldn't hardly put it down."
1,Very Disappointed,"I agree with the review that says this book is dull, dry and boring. Very hard to get into, and hard to stick with it.I am an aspiring romance writer and bought this book to help me write the love scenes. It did not meet my needs in any form whatsoever.This book is more a discussion of the different types of sex: heterosexual, homosexual, masturbation, incest, rape, adultry, etc, and would be better categorized at such. It also seems to be aimed at those who write sex scenes that are just for the sake of sex, not scenes about love shared between two people. While it may be helpful to some, it wasn't to me and my writing.This is the first time I've ever requested a refund from Amazon, it was that bad."
2,disappointing,"this book is hard to get excited about its filled with alot of fluffwhen people buy a book like this they hope it is full of alot of useful adjectives to describe sex to write about the sex act in good, detailed and exciting ways, this is not what it delivers, I can't really comment on what it does deliver because the book is toohard to get into to find out"
5,Absolutely necessary book for serious writers,"Man, it's one thing to think about sex, another thing to have sex, and waaaaaay different to write about it. It's difficult to the max, especially when you really don't want to come off sounding like you're writing porn - or even erotica. Elizabeth Benedict has done a favor for all of us writers who have struggled with the topic, right down to interviewing famous writers of famous sex scenes. It's a resource for MFA students, authors, teachers, and just ordinary people who like to write for their own pleasure. The Joy of Writing Sex is sane and straightforward, entertaining and informing, hip and...sexy!"
3,Overall boring and outdated music.,"I know that these comments may annoy many Eric Johnson fans but I do feel strongly after reading the above comments and listening to this album. I also am a guitarist and buy my music to hear impressive musicianship. In a nutshell, while Eric Johnson may very well be one of the greatest guitarists ever, he is better as a sessionist. In songs like ""Minstrel Gigolo"" (Christopher Cross) he is incredible. However, on this album, as on all his solo albums I was disappointed. The style of his music comes out of the seventies. The songs are very poor. And unfortunately his brilliant technique do not compensate for the boring songs. But don't get me wrong. I consider him as an amazing guitarist, better even than Carlton, Ritenour, Satriani, Vai or DiMeola."
3,Not a good as the others,"First I love Eric Johnson, however, I was somewhat disappointed in this CD. I own every Eric Johnson CD and this is my least favorite. There are maybe 2-3 good songs on this cd, which is still more good songs than your run of the mill ""pop"" or one hit wonder bands out there today. But when you compare this CD to Ah Via Musicom and Tones which have excellent songs from the first to the last, it falls a little short. For first time buyers of Eric Johnson material I suggest you skip Venous Isle and go straight to the good stuff--Ah Via Musicom. PEACE:)"
2,Shut Up and Play!,"Eric Johnson is as talented a guitar player as God ever put on this earth. His chords and notes are so clean, it defies belief. You wonder out loud how someone could master an instrument as well as he does. Growing up in Austin, I have had the chance to see him numerous times, and my opinion of him has not changed in 20 years, he can't sing! I am sorry, but Eric has always had this desire to be a pop star. So many people in Austin just cringe at concerts when he stops rocking, so that he can sing one of his sappy lyrics. It is a waste. Now don't jump on me! I love the guy! But I wish he would stick to playing guitar and quit the singing. The guy just has so much talent."
2,"Ok, but certainly not elite","I bought this album after continually hearing how great a guitarist Eric Johnson is. While the album (and Tones which I bought also) does contain flashes of brillance and some very intricate soloing, too much of it is mundae, or produced to appeal to top-40 airplay.I consider Eric Johnson a very good player, with moments of greatness, but he is certainly no Scott Henderson or Steve Morse. Perhaps that best way to phrase it is, Johnson is a great rock player, one of the top 2-3 out there. But as an overall player he pales compared to someone like Henderson who has mastery over all types of music."
5,Will this guy ever stop...,"putting out top notch CD/s like this. I suspect not. Eric's talent is the stuff of legends. Someone once said Eric has his peer's, but none are better. I see they are right.Good job EJ."
4,A must for Iggy Pop fans.,One of my favorites. Great Quality. But I must say it's just another compilation of songs already on other CD's. Still a must.Jason C
2,Threshold of Fire by Hella Haasse,"Beautifully written novel based on history in fifth century Rome. This novel has remained in print since 1964, in several languages. Author, Helle Haasse, sheds light on events in history, in novel form. In this novel, the Roman empire is in its demise, Christianity is now the official religion. Its story takes place in the higher echelons of society and also in the streets of Rome. Fascinating to read."
4,Works with platform beds!,"This is the only bed rail I found that worked on my son's bunk bed. It was easy to install and it's easy to get into place at night. I have trouble getting it down, but my husband has no problem with it, so that might just be me."
3,Does not fold down flat!,I am using this bedrail on a bed with a slat roll not a box spring but it would not fold flat no matter what bed I put it on. It is very easy to put together and does not budge when I lean on it in the bed but it does not fold down to make changing the sheets any easier!
4,"Good product, great price.","My three and a half year old granddaughter has transitioned from a bedside co-sleeper, to a convertible crib with a Kidco safety rail, when the front of the crib was removed, to a two piece twin bed using this Dex products bed rail.This is a very useful safety device when properly used. The child should be capable of getting into and out of bed on their own and not think the bed rail is a climbing toy.It looks like most of the negative reviews were posted by parents who didn't observe the safety warnings posted on the box and on the enclosed instructions.Bottom line. It works well when used as directed."
2,Not so Universal,This product will not work with a crib that converts into a toddler bed. The rail is too long to allow a child to safely exit a toddler bed that has rails on three sides. I suspect the rail will only work with a full sized twin bed.
1,Does not fold down flush with side of bed,"Overall, I think this is an okay product--relatively simple to assemble, works well with our son's platform bed, simple to use child-safe hinge. However, the rail does not fold down flat against the side of the bed when in the ""down"" position. When folded down, the rail sticks out at least eight inches from the bottom of the bed. This creates a tripping hazard and makes any bedding stick way out from the side of the bed. I want a rail that folds flat during the day so that I can easily pull up my son's duvet and quilt to make the bed and then pop up the rail at night when he goes to sleep. If you plan to leave the rail in the up position at all times and don't care about being able to make the bed each day, then this product would probably be fine for you, especially if you have a platform bed."
4,Dex Products Universal Safe Sleeper Bed Rail,"This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a ""bunkie"" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a ""big boy"" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)."
2,Not for babies,Bought this fir my preschooler and 7 month old baby only to read when received that it's not to be used with baby cause they may become entrapped and suffocate ... It should say this on the product description!!!
2,Deceptive - not for kids! beds,"I bought this railing upon recommendations online and thru the 'baby' store recommendations. I also read theFRONT of the box! and saw the photo of a child sleeping in a twin or toddler bed. As I put the railing togetherthe enclosed instructions state: NEVER use on toddler bed, bunk bed, waterbed, or bed with inflatable mattress. Useonly on adult bed with mattress and mattress support as defined by the manufacturer . ADULT BED!!! WHAT!!I went to the box - there on the back of the box were the same instructions. However, all eyes focus on the front ofthe box - child sleeping, 'The ONLY bed rail that works with ALL beds-even platform beds-GUARANTEED!', etc.What a deceptive company!"
5,Safe Sleeping,"I love this product and have been using it for the past 2 years. I sleep better knowing my son has this on his bed. I dont know if he still actually needs it, but Im personally not ready to give it up!! Good quality, great product!"
4,great for toddlers,"Bought this bc my son fell one time out of bed he tends to move around A LOT while he sleeps. After this, he was pretty much safe. Very sturdy, he even leans on it. Only thing is that i wish it was a bit longer coz one time he actually slipped on the bottom part of the bed where this doesnt cover it."
1,Not as advertised,"This bed rail is advertised as an adult bed rail, but when box came it said child's bed. It was too small and light weight for adult bed. It works well for a child if that's what you need."
4,Deep bed rail,"I am pleased with this rail. The depth is exactly what I was looking for to fit an extra deep mattress on a platform style bed. It's sturdy secure and long. I love that its pivot point is higher to allow for the lip of the bed frame. My only gripe is that when the rail is in it's down position so as to allow access to change the bedding, the rail does not drop straight down alongside the bed. It angles out a bit like a ramp still forcing some stretching over the rail to access the bed. That's the only reason its not 5 stars. I'd buy it again because it suits my needs."
4,Great bed rail for platform beds,"This bed rail works very well with a platform bed, which was my main concern when I made my purchase. The two hinges on either side have to be released together, so if you have a short arm span, it might take a little extra work to release the hinges. But this is only a mild inconvienence, which is far outweighed by the fact it can be lowered so you can lift your child in and out of bed. It took about 10 minutes to put together and only a few minutes to install. I've had the product for about a month and so far it has held up well to my kids jumping and playing on the bed. This bed rail was the only practicle solution I found for my son's platform bed."
1,Universal - I think not,"I had purchased the Universal because I have a twin slat bed with full bed frame. As this rail folds down at a higher point than regular rails, I thought it might work. And that is the only good feature in this rail.First of all, it only works if you have solid bottom not slats. The width of the rail made it so the legs did not align with the slats.Second, the thickness of the plastic hinges made it very hard to fit the mattress back into place. The mattress stabilizer bar is square which is a bruising hazard. I did not really care if the side did not fold down all the way, but the thickness/bulkiness of the plastic on the hinged legs and the mattress stabilizer bar prevents the rail to stay horizontal against the mattress.Third, all of these unfortunate features are going to make it hell to change the sheets."
5,Perfect for a platform bed,I have a lifetime crib that we converted into a full size bed. It had the slats that made it a platform and the bed rail we had didn't fit. I ordered this rail and it was so easy to put together. It slipped right in under the mattress and the side of the wooden bed rail. It is very secure!! I would recommend this to anyone with a lifetime convertible crib.
4,Pretty Good.,"This rail is good, certified by the JPMA, easy to assemble. Worked with box springs and 10"" futon mattress. My only complaint so far is that (1) The rail is not easy to fold down - I have long arms, but you have to ""unlock"" the rail at each end at the same time, so it's not very easy and (2) the rail does NOT lay flat against the bed once it's down. So the bed looks like it has wings. That's really annoying, as you tend to walk into in a lot. Other than that, it's fine."
2,not what you think,This does not fold down 90 deg. Don't buy if you think you'll be able to fold down and change sheets or something.
5,Help for my Aging Mother,"Mom has fallen out of her bed twice now.We even removed the frame.She is 87 and has trouble getting up ,down and every place in between.I need to keep thinking of ways to keep her safe in my home.This bedrail is wonderful.I love the extra security of the bar that goes between the the mattress and box spring.It is also in just the right place to actually help her to get up out of bed easier."
2,does NOT work with all beds,"Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this product does not work well with a bed where the mattress sits in the frame. The drop down assembly needs about 3 inches of space, and the anchor needs a box spring to function properly.The product was well packaged but seems a bit flimsy once installed.And if you do have a box spring, you can get this for $20 on target or walmart's web sites."
5,One of my faves!,Arrived quickly and in great condition. I love this play and highly recommend it to anyone not familiar with the work of Jean Kerr.Her writing sparkles and it is very funny and witty! You wont be sorry!
5,Awesome movie,I decided to rent this despite the fact that it's an older film because I love Rutger Hauer. The plot has a lot of twists and turns and a surprising ending. This one is definitely easy to overlook but certainly worth seeing if you're a fan of thrillers. Enjoy.
4,archives,"a while back ago i watched this movie on tv and for some reason the entertainers stuck in my head I knew who they were but, like some the Name escapes them so You describe it online and Wala you have the movieI liked the EntertainerNatasha the best and then the guy followed up next as ok to watch it was entertaining up to the ending and the ending actually has a quick change/twist."
3,Past Midnight,"This item was purchased as a gift for someone else. This person is a fan of actor, Clancy Brown. The service was accurate and quick. The movie arrived in excellent condition."
2,unconvincing,"I love watching Natasha Richardson, but this is a film with a contrived plot and seems like a knock-off hatchet job. All of the actors have done better work."
3,Ok but not great,The photographs are done well but at some points not taken at the right time. Slightly hard to follow. I sugest getting Fumio Demuras's books and learn from them. then get this book to try to learn kata from it. Also a video of the kata would not hurt.
4,Ryukyu Kobudo,"This book is required in a library like mine. Espcially since I am a memebr of ""Ryukyu Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai"". The list of katas and the lineage of Taira Sensei is good. It is a liitle disapointing that almost every photo in the book is of McCarthy himself."
2,of value to those who practice this style of bo,"Most of Mccarthy's books are great but this one is not about Ancient Okinawan Martial arts but of his own style of bo. If you are interested in any bo this may be helpful, if you are looking for information on classic Okinawan bo, we are still out of luck"
3,Little Feat Import,"This CD has several good songs not found on the ""Best of Little Feat"" CD. Also, there are not any live versions on this CD, only the original studio versions. However, when comparing the sound quality, I find the ""Best of"" has markedly better dynamic range than this import."
4,Little Feat = Big Music,My first Little Feat album was Time Loves A Hero in 1977. I started to backtrack. The first 3 albums are great. Waiting for Columbus is the 2nd best live album of all time after The Band's 'Rock Of Ages'. The Lowell George period of Little Feat is amazing. My 2nd favourite band of all time after The Band.
3,"great selection, terrible sound","All my favorite songs, but they sound like they were bootlegged off my old roommate's tape player. Muffled and flat, no matter how loud you crank it up. Very disappointing."
5,A life-changing book; an important work.,"This book will challenge - and possibly alter - your perceptions of the disabled. The disabled person that you know (your uncle, spouse, neighbor, or client) will be seen in a new light. A friend, working wonderfully with the disabled for years, now sees her clients in yet a new way. You will, also. Read this book. You owe it to yourself. It is beautifully written, with great and moving senstivity."
5,Interesting text-reader friendly-workable exotic recipes,"I enjoyed the historical content, and reading about the evolvement of this style of cuisine. The recipes were different and worked well and it has become a favourite amongst my cookery books"
3,cushion will leak,I bought the first one of these a year ago and it split and started leaking in 2 months. It was replaced without a problem. The second one started to leak after 10 months. It's a nice product but it will not last long with daily use.
4,"A Story Is Told, True and Otherwise","Mr. Reap relates numerous short humorous tales about people. Although written in the 1950s and expressing a few no-so-modern stories, it is nevertheless a good book."
4,A very good commentary. . .,". . .on an important, and much neglected Old Testament book.The prophet Zephaniah preached during the reign of Josiah -- the greatest reformer of the Southern Kingdom. Yet, we know very little about the man and his life and times. Dr. Berlin's excellent commentary situates Zephaniah in his historical setting, illuminating some of the more difficult statements he made. At the same time, Dr. Berlin does not neglect to address various alternate theories about Zephaniah regarding his person, date, time, and audience.A worthy addition to an excellent series.Recommended."
2,Sadly dissapointed,"I have spent multiple occasions in worship with Ron and Patricia Owens and have been extremely thankful for their fresh style of worship. I purchased this book from Ron himself with great anticipation. I was unfortunately dissapointed. So much of the book lacked the scriptural support that I have come to expect from him. Secondly, as a former missionary, I was greatly dissapointed by the western bias that was at times evident. Certain items are deemed unacceptable in the book because of their regard, or disregard, in our culture yet they are in reality used effectively among other cultures and this is not considered in this book and neither is a scriptural support given to explain Ron's difficulty with these matters. All in all it is certainly a thought provoking book, yet one with which I must regretfully say failed to live up to my expectations for it."
3,Not as Strange as the Title Suggests,"Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu role-playing game is undoubtedly one of the most popular and enjoyable role-playing games to date. Strange Aeons, a guide for various storylines for the game, is not exactly the best example of a guidebook for the game. It is a good adventure if you are a relatively new ST/DM/Keeper, but if you really wish to have an adventure in these settings, I would suggest going on your own with a little bit of background information. The information in Strange Aeons is incomplete, and has very little detail."
2,Not enough flow,"I bought the Kohler K-T396-4 in January mostly because I liked the Devonshire series design and color. My bathroom was finally ready to use this week. I was/am disappointed by the flow from this shower head. There's nothing in the install guide about increasing the flow so I called the Kohler support site to ask if there was a flow restriction ring I could remove. They said no, this shower head deliver the standard 2.5 gallons per minute and cannot be adjusted. Turns out if you remove the shower head and take out the filter screen theres a small black grommet you can take out which seems to increase the flow a bit. I'm going to try it, but I'll probably end up just replacing the head with something else.I definitely would not buy this shower head again."
3,Not as good a value as it seemed.,"This is a beautiful fixture, but the finish scrapes/chips very easily. Also, notice what comes with it. We had to go to a bathroom specialty shop to buy a mixer type thing (~$40) to run the water through. Lowe's and Home Depot don't sell the mixers. They claim their products already include them."
5,Excellect performance shower head.,I purchased this product to go with all the other Kohler fixtures that I had the contractor install for the three bathrooms we recently remodeled. The Kohler fixtures I have found to be of great quality and I'm very happy with how they look and function.
5,Good! Swingman,Good swingman material & delivery service. Finally got a NBA jersey of my favorites( Iverson ) .
5,He's Done it Again,"Where would chocolate freaks be without Marcel Desaulniers? I adore cake and I adore chocolate, so his new book, which is filled with delectable recipes for all kinds of chocolate cakes, is right up my alley. I can go to it for a relatively simple middle of the week treat and right back to it when I'm looking for a special occasion cake."
5,Chocolate Recipe Book,"What a deal this was! Very inexpensive with lots of great recipes for chocolate lovers. It is used, but, still very good condition. Yummy."
5,A Stunning Book,"I'm sorry to say that I owned this book for years before I actually tried to make one of the recipes in it. I purchased the book, and then, as with many other cake books, was put off by the seeming difficulty of the recipes. Here's where this book differs from the rest: The instructions for making the cakes and assembling them are painstakingly clear. (The author even offers advice about not eating too much of the ganache so that enough is left over for the cake.) Of course, as with any recipe, you should read the entire recipe before beginning. The photographs are stunning, and the recipes are inventive and original. I will continue to make my way through Death by Chocolate Cakes with confidence that the end result will be a cake that wins raves and resembles the one in the beautiful photograph that accompanies the recipe."
1,badly organized book,"1. it doesn't show steps clearly2. there is no picture associated with each steps.3. like say ""Make the Mocha Mud Cake"", it is just one longparagraph, which steps are not separated into easy to readsteps. plus, there is no picture associated with each step.how did everyone overlook this and give this 5 star?"
2,Not what I thought I was getting.,"This book focuses on the outside of the sachet -- how to make artsy little fabric bags to hold herbs. The author includes only a few recipes for actual herbal blends, which was what I was hoping to find. (More specifically, I was hoping to find information on individual herbs to help one in blending sachets for various purposes.)If your interest is on the exterior of the sachet, this is may be what you are looking for, but if you want information to help you blend the herbs, this is not the place to get it."
5,a wonderful addition to this series,"Oke and Bunn continue their story of the babies who were raised in the ""wrong"" families, now grown young ladies with lives of their own. Anne feels happy and contented as a doctor's wife and is looking forward to the birth of their first child when tragedy strikes. Nicole, traveling to England to claim her birthright, is torn between her sense of duty and following her heart. Oke and Bunn weave another fine tale of God's love and plan for these two lives as the Song of Acadia series continues."
5,Song of Acadia Series,This is a great book. Really holds ones interest. She is an excellent writer.This is a great Historical seriesof the settlement of our country by the French and British.
3,Slow,"I read all three books in the series and they were good enough to make me want to read all three to see what happened, but I am a very fast reader so I knew it wasn't a huge time investment. The three books could have been combined into one. They were very slow and boring at times. I am a huge fan of the Love Comes Softly series by Janette Oak so I was a little disappointed with these. I also didn't like how the English parents got the benefits of both daughters but the French parents pretty much never saw either one again. The book makes that pretty clear."
2,Definately a children's book,"Be aware that this is very much a childrens book and as such, may even be a good one. I expected a more mature read like some others written by Treece, however."
3,Beauty is in the eye..,"Not all horror movies are classics, let's get that straight. But for those of you who appreciate monstrous killers, moody settings, and Janet Julian, Humongous is the flick for you. Yes it is typical of the genre. Idiot kids destroy thier boat, wash ashore on what they believe to be a deserted island, and run afoul of death. What seperates this movie from others of its ilk is the mood created by this film. Dark, well scored, and of decent acting, Humongous may be considered a hidden gem."
3,"Good old 80""s horror!!",I'll keep this short. If you're a fan of this film and have been waiting for a decent copy of this film so you can actually see whats going on ....here it is. don't wait! it was like seeing the movie for the first time!
3,"or 2 stars, rare, cable, 80's show","lil' suspenseful, kindascary, dark, weird, kinda different, just barely ok show-its a deranged grown up human monsta! when i edit or update this site doesn't let you change the stars-drag."
2,Snore-Fest,"Even for slasher fans, this flick may be a chore to sit through. Besides the fact you never get a half-decent chance to see the main monster/bad guy, all of the outdoor night scenes are so incredibly dark and muddy you're actually left to guess what's going on. (I'm not exaggerating, either.) Definitely a by-the-books slasher film in all other regards, but without the early-80's blood and gore. Only recommended for insomniacs."
3,"Very, very rare movie!","If your a collector of rare movies get this one, it might even be in the places you might least expect, maybe even in a second-hand store. I had this title, the discontinued original copy but traded it for another movie. The acting is bad but it's alittle interesting to watch as are most B films, I can't give you much explanation except at the beggining a woman gets raped and the dogs of the island kill the man who raped her. Then some teenagers were stranded on the island and there is some sort of monster chasing them around and so on. Well like I said buy it for a cheap laugh!"
1,AND YET ANOTHER ONE!,"Oh! man how many of these were there???? Meaning thekiller killing the teens in the woods. I swear I love80's HORROR and some of the GREATEST flicks came fromthat decade,but also some of thee LAMEST! Like this pileof SPEW! First the plot! A bunch of teens become strandedon a island/woods and are chased by a deformed killerwho worships his mother's corpse(Oh! That's a new one?!?)Not a honest moment of HORROR or SUSPENSE in this movie.If you like a SLASHER in the woods HORROR buy JUST BEFOREDAWN and SLEEP AWAY CAMP! Stay away from CRAPTURDGOUS!I'd rather watch SISTER ACT 3:LIKE MORE..NUN FOR ME PLEASE!"
1,The title is an accurate description of the amount of my disappointment when I finally saw this.,"Humongous (Paul Lynch, 1982)Prom Night director Lynch is back with a made-in-Canada cheapie about a bunch of kids who get stranded on an almost-deserted island inhabited only by a reclusive old lady. While it's miles better than Prom Night and does have a plethora of even lovelier ladies than that movie did (too bad so few of them could actually act; I'd sit and watch Janit Baldwin all day if she had even the barest smidgen of talent, because she's just plain hot in this flick), it's still silly and predictable, cleaving to all the conventions of the slasher genre without throwing in a single original bit. I spent over twenty-five years waiting to get my hands on a copy of this flick, and what a letdown it ended up being. *"
2,"Great colors, won't last","I was easily able to mix the colors to match our leather couch. The patch given with the kit stayed in place as long as you don't touch it. Of course, on a couch it will be used, sat on, etc... and within one day the color came off the patch and the patch fell out of place. The only real use I see for this kit is if you are repairing a small, very small, section of leather that will not be touched ever. Do not use on chairs, couch, jackets, gloves, etc...because it will not hold or last at all."
1,You don't always get what you see,Liquid Leather - Make Fast and Easy Repairs to Leather ~ Leather Cleaner & Conditioner.I could not believe the small package that my husband gave me. The product I ordered could never fit into that...but it did. I needed a lot of the product and the one advertized look like (I counted) 18 containers. When I opened the package there were only 7 containers. I think that the product was misrepresented on Amazon which is poor marketing tactics. I could have bought the one at Kragen for $14.00 instead because with shipping and handling it came up to $14.39. At least at Kragen I would not be deceived because what I saw on the shelf is exactly what I would have gotten in the package.
3,The beginning is classic Hornblower; didn't like the last half,"The book starts out with another interesting problem for Hornblower to solve, which he does with great imagination and turns it into a much greater victory than anyone could imagine. I could have skipped the 2nd half of the book.What turned me off? It was probably a couple of things. First, it had nothing to do with the sea and turned him into a guerilla fighter. It didn't fit with what he was good at. I also was disappointed in him for his blatant unfaithfulness to his beloved (?) wife. I shouldn't let that bother me, but it did. It is interesting to me that I can lose respect for a fictional character."
4,The ninth book in the Hornblower series.,"It is 1813 and Lord Hornblower has been given the task to rescue Lieutenant Chadwick from the mutinous crew of the Flame. Force does not seem to be the answer, but if Hornblower does not do something the crew threaten to turn the ship over to the FRENCH! And THEN he has to deal with a Prince of France and his wife Barbara meets his mistress Marie!"
5,A High Point In The Series,"C.S. Forester never fails to tell an exciting tale and 'Lord Hornblower', the 9th novel in the series, is one of the best. Centering on the time around the treaty of Fontainebleau and up through the hundred days and Waterloo, 'Lord Hornblower' has the recently made K.C.B. Hornblower dispactched to deal with a mutinous crew at sea. Eventually, the peace with France allows Hornblower to visit those who sheltered him there during the war. But when Napolean returns to lead France once again, Hornblower finds himself leading a band of partisans against the restored Emperor. This is the last Hornblower novel to take place during the wars and it is a more than fitting end to Hornblower's own battle with Napolean."
5,The best of the series,"I prefer more mainstream historical fiction like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""Cold Mountain"" to tightly focused sea tales like Forester's Hornblower series. But the Hornblower books are SO WELL DONE that I just can't resist them. Lord Hornblower tops a very good list of Hornblower books, it, only Hornblower During the Crisis is nearly as good."
4,Good book and a great series,This book has good character development and good story. The entire series has shown a character with flaws and fears while providing a great story.
4,A Must for Mom's,This product is a great reference for mom's. It is a must to leave when you are having someone babysit. All contact information and specific information for your childern is in one place. I also like that it has a place for the pets. It's great when someone is pet sitting for us. It gives me peace of mind that if someone needs me or something goes wrong the appropriate contact information is there.
1,Painfully unlistenable,Man i found thiz album at a flea market and i thot i'd listen to it so my mom bought it for me and it sucked!!! The songs are so f***ing long it makes me sick and they seriously lack material. I don't know why everyone thinks this guy is so cool cuz he talks about the same s*** over and over and the choruses are waaaaaaay overplayed. DO NOT BUY THIS!! It wasn't even worth the 3 bucks i payed for it.
3,Bought book-dissatified,"The book was on sale as for ""New and hardcover."" Neither was true!! This book has definitely been used and is a soft cover. I'd appreciate it if the seller would be honest about the product that is being sold. Thank You!!"
3,Should be titled Body Shape not Body Image,"While I really enjoyed the book, I felt it concetrated may too much on issues of thinness and weight. I think the author did a good job of looking at a variety of studies and including both psychological and sociological studies; however, I feel that body image satisfaction and dissatisfaction goes way beyond just looking at body shape. If you're looking to read about body image outside of the 'weight debate' look elsewhere."
2,"Weak horror, weak science fiction, hardly a classic.","Isaac Asimov's Fantastic Voyage II is a much better treatment of the miniaturization theme, for hard science fiction content and characterization. This story spent too much time inside the main character's dumb, empty head, with his descent into self-pity being far worse than the stress and perils of growing ever smaller. The other characters were flat and uninteresting. Once you tire of the protagonist bemoaning his fate (and you will tire of it) there is little to make you keep reading, except hope for an interesting resolution. Well, forget it, there isn't one. The ending does not follow logically from the rest of the story and provides no resolution.The story fails as science fiction and mostly fails as horror fiction. Pared down, it would have made a good script for a comic book. It also probably would work as a juvenile book club selection."
3,A Hard Time With Shrinkage,"Richard Matheson is a master, no doubt. No. Doubt.But this book was a hard read for me at times. And I realize that where I had trouble was when Matheson would chronicle shrinking man, Scott Carey's, daily survival in the cellar. Now, as necessary as these scenes are, I would not look forward to reading the cellar passages.Extremely incredible though, is the drama and the pain and the humiliation Matheson writes upon our main character. INCREDIBLE passages each time we would flash back to times when Scott Carey was larger, yet still, shrinking smaller.The most amazing scene to me was when (no spoilers) Scott meets the circus ""freak"". ""Oh to be a man again..."" Wow... Richard Matheson really is incredible.So, personally, I have to give this one 3 stars because it was half incredible and half hard read.Also, the ending is powerful in a way that we will never relate to, but will inspire us."
2,Don't Buy,"After my Stovteks started sounding flat, I replaced the preamp tubes with JJ's. JJ's are supposed to be the best boutique tube. However, mine was microphonic right after it was installed. There are better tubes out there. Get one that is quality tested."
5,Inexpensive and my cat loves it,"I originally found this toy at a grocery store and my cat adored it--she kicked that sucker to death, tore its body in half and scalped it stripe by stripe. Once it'd been murdered beyond recognition (eventually she even tore out the squeaker in the snake's head), I couldn't find replacements anywhere. Thankfully they're available on Amazon, and since these snakes are her fave I now buy them in bulk.They're definitely cheap--the eyeballs are just paper stickers and are usually the first to go, then the cardboard body gets floppy after a half-dozen plays and eventually gets ripped in half. But nothing else brings out the murderer in my kitty quite like her ""snakey."" If you have a cat with a killer instinct who loves to bust out the ""kill feet,"" this snake toy will probably make kitty's day."
4,"Dead Bank Walking, but with a big limp","I was there during the period of this book, at a lower level of Security Pacific. I found the book almost unbelievably exciting and scary. It explains much about what was happening to the ""troops"" that we could not understand. Smith did a good job of keeping the true problems away from all of us, including employees and the public, as he no doubt had to in order for the merger to succeed. All in all, anyone with any interest in banking and finance should find this an exciting and informative book."
3,DEAD EXECUTIVE TALKING,"One-third an attempt at executive character rehabilitation in the best PR-spin fashion, one-third an attempt at ""it wasn't our fault"" based on the SODDI (Some Other Dude Did It) defense, and one-third ""mea culpa"" for the wrongs that we committed by others.Mildly amusing as an historical recollection of events during trying times, but even better as an insight into the ""gentleman's club"" that was banking.It's all here: the arrogance, the posturing and the inability to listen to those subordinates who clearly sounded the alarms before the iceberg was struck.Bottom-line: wait for the book's appearance on the remainder table at $1.99 and congratulate yourself on being fiscally responsible enought to evaluate the contents based on the reviews."
3,A Good Quick Read for Current/Former Employees...,"3-1/2 stars.Mainly of interest to people employed in the banking/financial services industry, especially those with some connection to Bank of America or Security Pacific - like me. Don't imagine this book would thrill the average reader; agree with comment that potential buyers should wait for the book to end up in the bargain bin."
1,If You Were There......,"In general, I agree with all of the reviews by the folks who understood Security Pacific, and, disagree with all of those who had no other knowledge of Security Pacific than Bob's book. I do agree that the book did read like a novel and it did sound like Bob, who at times was a likeable person to be around, however that doesn't offset the many ""un"" and ""half"" truths potrayed in this book.I was very surprised to find out just how bad off we were, so I do agree with the person that said Bob did a good job of keeping that information from the troops. But to what avail? Bob did sell the employees down the river. If you didn't get layed off, you were very poorly treated by B of A employees and management, and it's unbelievable that Bob didn't forsee that.I believe that, with all of the innovation exhibited by Security Pacific employees in the past, in both financial and technical aspects, had Bob been a forthright and competent leader, Security Pacific would not have failed."
4,Great Camera to Drop in Your Pocket,"I got this camera to replace an Olympus C4000 that was too slow focusing and bulky for my needs (shooting my toddler). I have had it for about 9 months now and still think its great. One reason I bought it was the price (under $200) and the reviews I saw on the web (like dpreview.com). It is small enough to go in your pocket. It can be used in the rain without fear of damage. The fireworks shots I took , a couple can be seen in the user images for this camera, where unexpectedly good and done HANDHELD without a tripod using the fireworks program! There are a couple of cons, but minor and are to be expected for a camera of this type, ie. weak indoor flash (fix with software), sometimes takes long in low light to focus, no lens protection. But in all, would buy and recommend again. Make sure you invest in NiMH batteries and a charger and you will be all set! Happy shooting!"
4,A good read,"Clare Springer was sent to France to complete her education. Clare falls in love with Paris and Fabien. Not listening the warnings of others decides to stay in Paris even as the German army advances. Soon Paris falls and Clare finds herself trapped. Not one to do other, Clare is drawn into the cause of freedom and starts working for the resistance. But working for the resistance may cause Clare to lose her freedom and maybe her life.""Clare's War"" is the first book that I have read by Anita Burgh and if you are fan of war-time books you may want to check this book out. Ms. Burgh does a great job of creating a good story and characters. It may be hard to find, but ""Clare's War"" is well worth the try."
5,Christmas Karaoke,This is a nice cross-section of different types and stylesof Christmas music with quick delivery from the seller.
1,Burnt by Where,"This was sent to me on time and it works, but after that everything about this experience was in my opinion bad. The disk was a burnt copy of a CD+G. It was in a plastic sleeve. I contacted Wherehouse Karaoke to return it and they said I could not return it because it was ""as described"". Well I've looked at their description over and over and can not find anywhere where it says ""It may be a burnt copy"". So I wanted to make sure the next person knows what they are getting...a burnt copy.Not very good customer service. Good luck."
1,This is being returned to The Learning Company,"I just purchased this today, and it is extremely disappointing. I was looking for a software package that would help my 2nd grader learn his math facts, and this certainly isn't it, as far as I can tell. There is zero documentation included, so there is no way to steer your child towards games that would help his or her weak areas. I couldn't find a game that drilled them on anything, just a lot of pointless point and click activities."
5,Great Value,"This is a good value. I have been using this for my 6 year old Rat Terrier since he now objects to tooth brushing and scraping. With the addition of two more dogs, I have found PlaqueOff to be effective when combined with regular dental chews. No more brushing and scraping"
1,Dog couldn't tolerate it,"I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, my dog developed diarrhea that lasted for days after just 2 meals with this stuff. After the first attempt I waited about 3 weeks before attempting again, with the same results. Bummer. I have to brush his teeth after all. :("
4,Good stuff,Easy to use---can see the difference in before and after use.I think this product helps keep my dog's teeth healthy.
3,Not effective,"I have been adding PlaqueOff to my dogs' dry food everyday for over 7 months. I also brush their teeth very thoroughly every night with enzymatic toothpaste (I'm somewhat obsessed with their health). I honestly have not perceived any improvements (or the slowing down of plaque or tartar buildup) due to the PlaqueOff. In fact, one of my dogs had a professional dental cleaning 1 month ago, and already his breath is starting to smell again and his teeth are not as clean as they were immediately after the cleaning. However, I will continue using the PlaqueOff because perhaps it is benefiting the dogs' teeth in a way that I cannot see, my vet recommends it, and the dogs also don't mind the taste of it."
2,"Proden PlaqueOff Dental Cae for Dogs and Cats, 180 mg","After six months of constant uese, I did not find this product effective in discouraging plaque buildup on my dog's teeth."
3,Okay Product,"Not 100% sure how well this works. I bought it to help remove and/or prevent plaque buildup on my dog's teeth. She is 5 years old now. Have used it for maybe 6 months or so now. A little tiny scoop (provided) is all you need. Just mix it in their food. She doesn't seem to notice it is in there. Doesn't eat around it or anything so I guess it tastes OK. Her teeth are in fairly good shape. Still some plaque on the back teeth though. I also give her lots of chew treats, rawhides and chew toys so I don't really know what is working. Maybe they all are combined. So far, plaque build up seems pretty well controlled but I can't swear it is this product that has done that. Worth a try I'd say. This size jar will last a really long time. I'm thnking I got it around 6 months ago and it's not quite half gone so I know it will last at least a year. I do use it daily. Rarely skip any doses."
3,Continue to use it,It got this because I am still checking out if it works or not - my dog didn't have much tartar so I haven't seen much change but it has only been a month.
3,Doggie Seaweed,"My dogs' vet recommended this product, specifically for my 10 year old pug since she's getting older and putting her under to clean her teeth at her age makes me nervous. Not sure whether this stuff is working but my dogs love it. This jar will last me years."
2,causes staining,"I tried this product for about a month on my Samoyed. She has very clean teeth EXCEPT for her top last molars. I did not see any improvement, but the product, which claims to change the chemistry of the saliva, causes her saliva to stain, so she developed brown marks around her mouth."
2,Better product out there.,I had been successfully using the evorapet powder for my dogs' teeth and it worked VERY well but is quite pricey. When it ran out I did loads of research on results of less expensive powders and so purchased this one. I've been putting this on their food for over a month and they are starting to develop plaque again. I even increased the recommended amount but it's not helping. This has gotten great reviews which I trusted and so bought the mega-size. I'm half way through the jar but will toss the rest and purchase the evorapet. It just works much better for my dogs.
5,Works on breath for my dog...,"Interesting seeing the different reviews of people saying it does or doesn't work, I went ahead and ordered some, since there seem to be more positive reviews.We have two small dogs, one of them has had HORRIBLE death breath for some time, it could clear a room. Within a few weeks she is back to normal, it's fun to play with her again without a gas mask! :-)I can't tell you if it is clearing up any Plaque, but without a doubt it has cleared up the death breath. Nothing else in her diet or activity has changed, just adding 1 scoop a day to the dog food."
4,Hard,"I loved putting this puzzle together, but it was hard! I had to enlist of friend of mine to help me or I would have gone crazy! Beautiful puzzle with lots of great hidden pictures inside."
4,Solid compilation,"Picked this up at the beginning of the year, and wasn't really disappointed with it. It's a smaller compilation released by Faze Action, featuring some of the common artists of the new electronic sound with brazilian flavors.While I don't think this release is really ground-breaking, it does have some rather nice tracks. It was this album that I first heard La Boca Del Rio by S-Tone Inc., and Supermarket by the hard to find Russ Gabriel. While some of the tracks on this are questionable, all in all, this is a good compilation to add to the collection.Solid release. Good for popping into the car and listening to on the way to the bar or club."
2,zombie not real,"I bought this movie with hopes that I was gonna get dawn of the dead,resident evil,rec..just to name few. Instead I got bad acting ,the zombie look fake it was truly unreal. This movie was low budget,but on a scale from 1-10 as far as quailty goes its a five. This movirs should have been sold for 3 bucks no tax. I was disappointed the cover tells a different story its a scam to get you to buy."
3,Zombie Undead DVD,"As a fan of zombie movies, which there are really great ones out there, especially by George Romero, I found this movie entertaining but not a ""to die for"" type movie. It had its good moments and slow moments, but in the end, a movie to just sit down, eat popcorn and enjoy. The zombies looked more like the ones in 28 Days Later, rather than ones shown in TV's Walking Dead. As I said before, put it on, sit down and watch another zombie movie out of the movie grinder."
2,Union Pacific,"Overall the book has so and so information about the locomotives of Union Pacific. If you like the Challenger, Big Boys, and the UP Streamliners, don't get this book. It does not show that much information about those trains. The pictures you find in this book, you can find elsewhere and has also been published on other locomotive books."
5,Organic Chemistry:4th Edition by John McMurry,"Organic Chemistry:4th Edition by John McMurry is a great book. I've read almost all the chapters in this book. Everything is easy to read and understand. Although there are a few mistakes in this book I believe this is a great book. Anyone who wants to purchase this book must buy the Solutions Manual for McMurry's Organic Chemistry (by Susan McMurry) because the book itself doesn't have all the answers to the questions and has no solutions. I haven't read any other organic chemistry books yet and this is the one I've used to learn organic chemistry. Therefore, I can't compare this one to the other organic chemistry books. I was able to learn organic chemistry on my own using this book before I took my organic chemistry courses a couple of yrs ago and I got A's in all of my organic chemistry classes. Of course, one must not forget that it takes time to learn organic chemistry. I think it's a great book if purchased with its solutions manual."
4,as organic chemistry books go this is definitely tops.,"mcmurry has an incredible ability to simplify a complex subject. without this book, i never would have made it through this course."
3,"Overall, this book wasn't illustrative enough.","After using this book for a year's worth of Organic Chemistry, I would recommend that anyone considering purchasing this book should use a different one. The examples are do not explain much and are mostly confusing. Reactions are not shown in full & there are inconsistentcies throughout both the text & solution manuel. More proof-reading would have helped a great deal.I've read Solomon's Organic Chemisty and preferred it over McMurray. At least the reactions make sense when I read Solomon's."
2,Disappointingly Unfunny,"This mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny. Considering the comedic caliber of its two stars, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, I was expecting a laugh riot, but that's not what this is. It's not their fault, it's the scriptwriter's. I guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper, but that humor just didn't translate to the screen, despite the best efforts of Mssrs. Crystal and Williams. They deserve better, and so do we."
1,Old Bonanza Episodes Are 10 Time Funnier,"I started watching this movie, got about 15 minutes into it, shut it off. What an extreme waste of talent for to of the funniest men in the world. No wonder this DVD doesnt sell and isnt available, and there's no reviews, i'm wasting my typing right now. Later on."
4,Modestly Amusing Film from Top Talents,"The film is amusing, in some places funny, but, mostly, it does not give two top comedy stars much to work with. Williams is made to seems to be sodden in performing a range of physical and verbal comic expressions; there appears to be a forced character to his behavior. Crystal handles the straight parts of his role adeptly but the hoped for comedy bits rarely hit the mark. In other words, a sound premise for a plot was not carried out in the plot itself. In sum, it is an enjoyable film which should be worth the time you put in watching, but it is not Robin Williams or Billy Crystal as they can be when working with better material."
3,Father's Day Review,The movie is entertaining and a good way to spend about two hours. Robin Williams predictable. This was not one of his better performances. Billy Crystal's performance was outstanding. I would not recommend this film for anyone under 15. There are some serious adult issues in it. It can be a bit heavy for younger viewers.
1,A dream team that turns out to be a snoozer,"FATHER'S DAY writers Lowell Ganz and Bobaloo Mandel wrote great film comedies such as SPLASH, CITY SLICKERS, PARENTHOOD and A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN. And FATHER'S DAY director Ivan Reitman made gems such as STRIPES, GHOST BUSTERS and TWINS. With zany Robin Williams and Billy Crystal in lead roles, how could FATHER'S DAY turn out to be so dull - and not even interesting? I don't know, but the story seems little more than a bunch of ideas for a film thrown together, as if there was not enough time to iron out the script before shooting the movie.Oddly, the athletic Robin Williams plays the softy while the runt Billy Crystal is someting of a tough guy in FATHER'S DAY. It's hard to believe and, more to the point, not funny. About the only refreshing aspect of the film is Nastassja Kinski, whom I had not seen in a film in more than ten years. Not that Kinski has much to do in FATHER'S DAY, but her brief, wasted presence is the movie's sole redeeming feature."
3,Good.....but don't worth 5 stars,"It was funny...but not so funny, williams has done better, and the story is not so exciting. But I can give it 3.5 stars."
3,A lot of brushes,The brushes come in a ziploc kind of bag which can be resealed.A small percentage of the brushes were not manufactured correctly and lost their bristle within seconds of usage.
5,the right item,good quality and price fit just right good quality and easy to install very good price good reputation manufacturer runs quite as advertised thanks
4,Why does everyone have a problem with this song?,"Sure it's not one of Britney's best, but it's a great & catchy track. The girl can sing! Everyone's going to slag off Britney at some point, and right now, everyone seems to be doing that, saying her new album is rubbish and whatever, but it's just going to be typical Britney stuff! You have to forget she's only 21, and every singer has an ""off"" song. If she keeps her career going, she's going to have a lot more ""off"" songs, which not everyone is going to like. But I have to disagree with nearly every other reviewer about this track - it's a great track to dance around and shake your booty to!"
3,i'm not really a slave for this cd!!,"The first track off her album 'britney', quite different to what i expected she would do. firstly, I hated this CD, but grew to like it. The song itself (as if u haven't heard it!) is okay, when you haven't heard for ages. The other song, featured, intimidated, has a wicked beginning, but is a bit weird, however, i grew to find it okay, but isn't really fantastic.Also, an interview is featured, but is only for real britney fans."
1,A CHORUS OF BOOS & HISSES! THROW PIES AT BRITNEY!,"I hate this song. I really do. I think the title and its message are very counterproductive. In addition to having a naturally insipid voice and a tired, formulaic style, Britney relies too heavily on provacative dancing and revealing clothing than to quality in performance.This is a musical sham. Instead of concentrating on quality, it is just a quick fix with almost no substance. A chorus of loud boos and hisses for Britney!"
5,ONE OF BRITNEY'S BEST SONGS!,This is one of the Britney's best songs! It has a catchy chorus and it's perfect you wanna dance!
4,Two Face,"Two Face has proved to be an impressive debut novel from author Kaven Brown. More of a crime/drama story, this book contains all the necessary ingredients for a delicious literary treat. The storyline grabs your interest from the very beginning and builds up to a satisfying end. Don't look for your usual baby-momma-drama or thug life story here, this author went outside the box on this one. Spanning sites from Cuba, New York and Florida readers are given a taste of the drug cartel through the life of cousins Eto and Cache.There are many stories detailing the cartel, but Kaven's originality separates him from the competition. The characters are real and the writing fresh and concise. It's always a gamble with a debut author, but with Kaven I would have to say it's win-win all the way.EnglishrulerARC Book Club Inc.Star Rating: 4.5"
4,Truly Innovative Crime Drama,"Kudos to Kaven L. Brown for his debut novel Two Face. A gritty portrayal of drugs, crime and the mafia. Mr. Brown holds no punches in this fast paced novel which chronichles the attempt of one female attorney (Sam Sharky) and two ruthless cubans ( Cache & Eto) to go against one of New York's most notorious crime families.This novel stretches form New York, through Miami and on to Cuba as readers will be pulled into rooting for the underdog. I especially loved the way Mr. Brown was unafraid to kill off main characters. I'm still mourning the death of two of my personal favorites.I'm eagerly anticipating the sequel, Two Face: Vengeance. And any other novels from this new literary talent."
5,Excellent Camera - small size,"I have had this camera for about 2 months. It is my first digital camera. I shopped for small size, fast shots, and good quality shots. So far, this camera has met these needs.The functions are easy and intuitive. Uploading to my computer via the memory card is easy. The display on the back of the camera is clear, even in daylight.And the size is great. I actually use an Altoid tin as the case!I highly recommend this camera."
5,Great camera!,"I didn't buy this camera from amazon (I found a lower price elsewhere). The Optio S4 is an amazing camera. I was going to buy the Optio S, but decided to hold out for the S4 since it had some options that were worth waiting for.I've only had it for 2 days, but it has been taking some great pictures. It's super-tiny! The quality of the pictures is not bad at all.With its features and the price, I would *highly* recommend this camera."
3,Great camera - but serious picture delays,"As an owner of an older model, I had been very pleased with the camera, particularly its small size (and perfect fit in a mint tin). However, with the S4 I was very disappointed with the shot to shot time. Especially for flash pictures, the picture button must be held down for a full 4 to 5 seconds to take a picture. Reviewing pictures is also slow - there is a 3 to 4 second pause between each picture when reviewing them on the camera. After using it for a year and being very pleased with all other features of the camera, this drawback alone has gotten annoying enough to want to get a different brand. According to the Optio, the delay is a result of slower processing speed within the camera. So if I was buying again, I would go with a different model of Optio with a better processing time, or check out a different brand."
4,Nice camera (and doublecheck readers comments...),"Just one information about something I read, please readers be carefull and always double check the reviews. The Casio EX-Z4 which this pentax is often compared to, use THE SAME optic of the Pentax (digital processing is different though).Minolta Xt is a 3mp very compact camera with totally different lens concept (telescopic instead of sliding).This camera is quite amazing: increadbly small in size, but with good features and quite good image quality.Some distortion and less sharp image in the corners, though, so doesnt really compare to an Ixus IV for example.But beware! The 4mp version doesnt bring much improvement over the cheaper 3mp former model.Same for the Casio. I would stick to 3mp versions for a better price/quality ratio - (well if you get a deal, 'cause on amazon they sell almost same price now...)"
1,too fragile!,"My 5th and smallest digital camera since 1999 - but much to fragile - suffering a cracked LCD (not covered under the warranty),thus making this cute little camera worthless after just 6 weeks. The pictures were great, it had all the features, but I am going back to a Minolta - my little Dimage X was much more durable."
1,What a pain,"What a pain to have to write this. I loved this little gem, but it died the second day we had it. It appears to be a fine piece of equipment, but I had to send it back. I'm going to buy the Canon S400 instead. The Canon is a tiny bit larger and hopefully will last longer than two days.While examining the menu options a grinding sound came from the speaker and my wife turned the camera off. Then it would no longer respond to the on/off switch. I called Pentax and it was indeed a dead puppy. There was no software reset or anything of that nature. I opted for a refund."
3,vbwrangler,Various connection software didnot find the phone; perhaps the cable should be sold w/o software for that phone. I don't know that this issue should be a direct reflection on the vendor. The vendor shipped reacted an shipped in a very timely manor.
5,MUCH TOO SHORT!,"I have one MAJOR complaint with this album: it is not NEARLY LONG ENOUGH. The combination of George Shearing and Peggy Lee is unbeatable. Why they did not record more and more together is a real mystery.Anyone who hears this album, jazz lover, pop lover, Shearing lover, Lee lover, anyone-- will come away smiling. Obviously, Shearing and Lee not only had a great respect for each other as artists, they also were having a ball.It's hard to pick out one or more favorites on an album that has no low spots, but the Latin arrangement of Cole Porter's ""Always True To You In My Fashion"" makes a standard into something new. I also loved Peggy Lee's sexually teasing way with ""You Came A Long Way From St. Louis.""MUCH TOO SHORT BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,GREAT PAN,This is a quality pan.It's lite weight but very strong and cooks food to perfection.I would recomend this pan to anyone who enjoys cooking.
5,It will be a starter on your kitchen team!,"I'm not sure how we got along without a pan like this for so many years. While billed as a lasagna pan, and it is indeed great for that, it can also be used as a small roaster pan, or any number of other uses. Just the right size, and cleans up easily! Appears to be solidly constructed and we expect to use it for a long time. One suggestion to Cuisinart: It, like any pan, would be enhanced by a plastic cover which could snap on and make leftover storage a breeze!"
2,A Lasagna Pan is Deep!,I agree with other reviewers that one cazn not buy a so-called lasagna pan when this page shows nowhere how deep it is. It's not a lasagna pan unless it is a minimum of 3 inches and preferably FOUR inches deep.
5,Little known German History,"I found the book to be informative and enlightening. The story of the Russian occupation of Germany, especially Berlin, after the war has received little, if any, attention by those writers of World War II history. The suffering of the Germans under Russian occupation was as severe as in the Russian Gulags. And of course many Germans ended up there as well. This book is well written and documented to provide a unique insight to this little known part of World War II history."
4,"Most of the best of AFOS, plus some questionable choices","I was in high school when AFOS's first album was released, and being a synth junkie I fell in love with the quirky band immediately. AFOS was a highly influential band, albeit a short-lived one, and this disc has many of their best. This import version also contains ""Windows"", an excellent little tune that was only released in the US as the B side of ""Space Age Love Song"" and is thus very hard to find. I particularly like ""Nightmares"", ""Transfer Affection"", the instrumental ""DNA"", and ""It's Not Me Talking"". Unfortunately, there are also some of AFOS's later songs on here, when they were trying to sound more like New Order than New Order did. Example: ""Who's That Girl""."
