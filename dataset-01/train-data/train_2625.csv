2,"Good design features, but not all can work well","I have set up my first 2100G camare, although i am happy with all designed features, but I could not make ""motion detection alert email"" working properly after 3 weeks of frustrated testing, with all sort of try and erro effort. The local d-link support also could not figure out the solution except giving me a replacement set. However the problem still exists."
2,Wireless fails a few months after purchase,"I bought this camera because I travel quite often and would like to see my infant son while on the road. At first the camera works as advertised. As others have reviewed, it is not the best camera, but it did what I needed.After a few months, the wireless connection fails all the time. It would connect and then disconnect. Even if I move the camera next to the wireless router, this happens, so it is not a signal strength issue. After that, the camera simply fails to connect at all wirelessly. It still works when connected by cable, but I paid for a wireless camera. Now I'm on the line with technical support, which is in India, and getting the run around."
2,Mixed Results,The camera works well when connected via Ethernet cable but falls short when used as a Wireless camera. The problem is very evident when one applies WEP security. Performance falls to unusable with frequent disconnects. Too bad as the camera does fairly well otherwise.
2,Like my Linksys better,"Dissapointed. Not very user friendly. Picture quality is only descent in perfect lighting situations. Does not like sunlight nor does it like low light.I've had a Linksys for 2 years and is much more user friendly. Also Linksys sends via email, streaming video instead of a snapshot.Hoping I can return it to Buy.COM."
4,"a little heavy for a ""summerweight"" comfortor","I was looking for a lighter weigt comforter for the summer months. This is a quality comforter, but it's as heavy as the winter one I already have. A good product, but perhaps a little mis-titled."
2,"Some good info, but too much fluff","I bought this based on all the rave reviews and I am disappointed. She makes the point for writing down ones goals and intentions in a way that I hadn't read before, but that's about all I got out of it. Her perspective isn't clear-is she a proponent of the Law of Attraction? Or maybe saying prayers to God or some other religious figure? The book seems to me to be a hodge podge of ideas which are not pulled together into a cohesive whole. I got tired of all the lengthy personal stories.Note to Kindle users (and this was not a factor in my review) there are many typos, mostly two or three words run together. You can usually figure it out , but it's a distraction when you are reading to have to stop every few lines."
3,The pen is mightier than the sword!,"In this book the author tells us (and shows us) that writing our goals down is very important. This is not about time management or a 'how to' write a journal as such, but, about putting on paper what your heart desires and what your mind wants to achieve.Illustrative with stories from people who made it happen by writing it down, and full of practical exercises to make you understand that the pen is indeed a mighty tool in scripting your destiny."
2,Could Be Better,"The general idea this book focuses on is quite interesting. Writing things down, setting goals, realizing your true potential, etc. in order to see certain positive changes happen in your life. Seems like something that would benefit us all, right? Unfortunately, this book allows ""all"" to take away the focus from YOU. The author spent too much time telling other people's stories and how writing things down helped them. Instead she should have spent MORE time discussing how you can do the same things and see positive results. If I wanted to read long extended details of random people's success stories, I would have bought a bunch of biographies instead of this book.Overall, this book wasn't bad, but I found myself skipping to the end of the chapters in order to find out how I can write things down and have life changing results. This is a self-help book, right?"
1,Did not like authors writing style. Too much filler!,"Here's an example, page 39-40:""When I arrived, he made me some tea and put a crusty loaf of peasant bread and a dish of olive oil on the table. Then he sprinkled fresh Parmigiano Reggiano on top of the oil. He told me his story with great gusto and as we talked, he tore off chunks of the bread and dipped them into the oil and cheese, inviting me to do the same."""
2,Uuuuuuummmmmmm!!!!!,"Perhaps my expectations were too high. I found some of the information helpful, but not much. I liked the suggestions for journaling even though I'm not one who would journal."
2,Uncertain of what it wants it wants to say...,"I must say that this book was, at times, an engaging read. But it was also all over the map, and frequently contradictory. I agree with Klausner that: a journal can be a great place to ""park one's worries;"" writing down one's fears could help someone acknowledge and face them; that writing about the outcomes you want can help you stay focused, etc. Then she goes and ruins it by saying all sorts of fluffy, ridiculous things, and recounting stories that I consider happy coincidences rather than direct results of writing."
2,"Good topic , Poor presentation","I am very disappointed in writing style of this author. this book could have written in lot simple style and easy to use methods, instead she has given examples in detail that you almost loose focus on what she is telling about.I would not recommend this book as there are better books out there."
5,Read this if you need motivation!,"I found both the book and author to be inspirational and refreshing to read. It was the sort of thing I was looking for; lots of real-life examples and ways to make changes in my own life. I highly recommend it because if you are looking for this type of book, there has to be at least one aspect of it you can use in your owm life."
2,Seems to miss a basic step,"I bought this because the author covers the fears and ""stuck"" feelings that accompany achieving what you want. However you go about accomplishing your goals, being really persistent, using Law of Attraction, what have you, you have to confront any fears you have about actually accomplishing your dream as well as staying on target toward accomplishing that dream. However, the author's solution for everything and the key to accomplishing what you want is to write everything down-- and that's it. She doesn't really go into how you can subconsciously be thwarting yourself despite consciously focusing on your goals, and how you can bring your subconscious mind in line to finally reach those goals. Writing your goals down is a very good first step, but you have to really, truly believe what you write will happen, and it's easy for your subconscious to send out enough doubt about it actually working to hold up any progress. Good intentions in the book, but not very substantial."
3,Very long and boring.,"This book is a personal journal of the author and people she known. I am not the type of person who like to know every details of another Preston's life. The book did offer good insights, but the writing style is dry to me."
4,Practical and inspirational,"Most of these kinds of books are pretty light on how to create disciplines and practices to create what you want with life. This book was surprisingly practical and inspirational all at the same time. I enjoyed the personal stories of success and appreciated the practical pieces of homework at the end of each chapter designed to move you into action on what you just learned. I read this book in a short timespan, but I would suggest reading it a chapter at a time and doing the suggested work at the end of the chapters to learn as you go.Really enjoyed it!"
2,the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls,"This book may be as well called ""the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls"". The author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories. However, if you are a self-help reader like me who is used to David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"", you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can."
2,Genie in a bottle,"The only worth while reading was chapter on writing it down on paper and getting organized. The book should have been forty pages to get the message across, and I would have loved it. Too much ink was used on having god look for lost items, and making a wish list."
3,"A good book overall, but gets a little boring.....","I started out enjoying this book but it seemed to get bogged down a little in the middle. Some of the stories seemed sort of trivial to me. When I read books about change, I want to hear the stories of huge change in peoples lives so I can relate my small changes to theirs. Overall this is worth reading, but I did find myself skimming the chapters towards the end."
4,Must read and share,"This book is full of possibilities. One gets a sense of excitement in the first few chapters. The wheels of thought start to create all sorts of situations in which the author's advice can be applied and successful. Personally, I had a list of people that I believe would benefit from this book, within the first chapter."
4,Amazing book,I bought this book though i read it works for RHJ yet what i loved about this book is the stories that was included after each technique. i loved klauser's way of writing i even bought another copy for my best friend. it trully shines a light of hope in the reader once u get to start reading it. the techniques are different which helps you choose the best one that suits your character.A MUST READ is what i trully want to say
1,Rehash - another self-help book that didn't need to be written.,"Here is another self-help book that didn't need to be written. The useful information could be summerized in a phamplet, if so much - the cover would be sufficient. Why this writing style is so popular is beyond my comprehension (maybe because people like me keep picking them up...AHHH!!!). The use of filler ""stories"" are quite uneccessary if the author has something unique or interesting to say, but in most of these books it is just a rehash of the same basic information. If this is the first of this type of book you are reading you may find some of it interesting and useful, but that is being generous, but, if you have read any other self-help book remotely similar, don't even waste your time."
5,THE BEST!,I have read many 'self-help' books throughout my life...this one is by far at the top of my list of favorites. A must read! I have tried some of the techniques and it works! The seller sent the book to me on time and....it was in EXCELLENT condition. Highly recommend!
4,Dream it out loud!,Those of you who have followed my newsletters and workshops know what a firm believer I am in bringing dreams to life. This is a rare book that teaches you how to create your own reality by writing down what it is you crave. An excellent guide to personal goal setting and achievement of those goals.
1,Didn't care for this at all,Lorraine Heath has lost her talent in drawing a picture and making it come to life. I agree with another reviewer---go back to Texas--that's where you best work shines.
1,No Results/poor shipment,"I did not see any results. Waste of money. It was packaged poorly where product was exposed and not only was it seen by the post office, but it was also seen by the person at (which address was used to sent product).It should have been packaged more discreatly and privatley. This was a private matter product and therefore noone was to know that I purchased a ""slimming product""."
1,Don't Waste your money for this one!!!!!,The content of this book is just a little common sense. Pepole went through ONE semester in a law school should know it already; otherwise I would wonder how can that person finish the entire law school program. Save you money for some meaningful review materials!!!!
3,So So,It's an ok chalk board but smaller than I expected and the metal sides fell off the first day. It was delivered before I expected it and the kids still use it but don't feel that I got my money's worth.
2,Chalk Broad without chalk or brush!,Delivery took some time to arrive. What you receive is a chalkboard without chalk or brush. Over-priced for the product.
2,white rice gf pasta,"This pasta has a nice taste, but is so starchy that it makes a mess when youcook it. I much prefer the brown rice pasta, cause it cooks better andretains it's shape much better."
2,NOT AS PICTURED!,"These are very nice dishes but the pattern is not as shown in the picture so I'm not very happy with them. The mugs do not have pink handles, they are white and the interior of the mugs is turquoise. The interior of the bowls is turquoise too. There is NO PINK ANYWHERE on the dinner plates, mugs or bowls, in fact the accent color on the plates is GREEN! The salad plates are not as pictured at all. Each salad plate has a large colored band on the rim and each rim is a different color. The rim colors are 1 pink, 1 yellow, 1 turquoise and 1 green. I ordered these dishes because of the colors AS SHOWN IN THE PHOTO and that's NOT what I got at all!!"
2,HELPFUL TRAVEL TOOL IF IT IS UP TO DATE,"I have ordered the MapEasy's Guidemaps to other cities and always found them to be very helpful.I was VERY surprised when I went to order the 2010 Guidemap for Chicago, that it was not available on Amazon. (Only a 2006 edition was available.) I had to go to another bookstore to purchase the 2010 edition."
2,Esoteric Anatomy,There is very little actual anatomy in this book. It is a strange conglomeration of new age philosophies and Chinese medicine as it pertains to massage.
3,bag of berry nuggets,"I was anxious to put these out thinking I'd have a slew of birds because of the strong berry smell. Except for one woodpecker checking it out once, not one bird has landed on it to feed."
5,Not as good as the OST 2,"So I bought this in conjunction with R.O.D the TV OST 2 because it was a good price. Although I actually prefer the second one, this one is nice because it's pretty jazzy. Not a whole a lot to say about this one but I like it =)"
1,Flowers: Portraits of Intimacy,"As a professional photographer, I found this book extremely disappointing. I purchased it because of the 'good' rating reviews I read under its title and the one good photograph which is on the cover. His lighting is terrible and his 'point of focus' using a macro lens, along with the compositions, make absolutely no sense. The only thing I would use this book for is to lecture on 'how not to do macro photography'."
5,Met the need perfectly,"I took this book with me on a missions trip to Mexico. I ended up sitting on the ground reading the New Testament part of the book out loud to kids, or they took turns reading with me. It was just the right reading level for the 7-12 year olds I was with, and just the right reading level for my not-so-great Spanish. The New Testament portion was an excellent summary of the life of Jesus. This is a great read aloud for very young children (age 2 and up) or a read alone for beginning readers. An excellent first exposure to the major stories of the Bible."
5,Adaptable and Informative,Gives good guidelines that are easy to understand. Excellent illustrations. Helpful for beginners as well as experienced artists. Claudia is a good teacher.
4,My 3rd graders LOVED it!,"I picked this up just as a movie to watch for end-of-the-year fun. I was pleasantly surprised at how funny it was. Yes, the ""hero"" thing was a little wishy-washy and a gander laying eggs doesn't make sense, but the comedy made up for it. I laughed out loud at the Princess Bride reference, Chevy Chase was very funny and the Who's On First spoof made all my students giggle. Overall I gave it 4 stars."
5,Wow! Jimmy sure sounds different!,"I was skeptical about Jimmy Eat World's new record, but now I think it just rocks! From ""Bleed American"" to ""Ayesh Beek""! Jimmy just can't go wrong!Some people might be surprised at the band's new direction, but Arabic music is a natural step from Emo!"
3,As I look for information on this play...,"The Contrast is a five-act play about a woman who does not want to marry the man her father wants her to. The language is not too difficult to understand, although a dictionary will be needed well.To quote the Norton Anthology of American Literature Volume A, ""It [The Contrast] was our [America's] first English-speaking comedy and an instant hit."" Performed in 1787 and published in 1790, this play offers a glimpse into America during the period of George Washington. Other than offering a historical perspective, the play will most likely not appeal to the modern reader; however, it is a necessary read for a student of American Literature, and a somewhat enjoyable one at that.A memorable line, ""Why, my dear friend, you are not acquainted with the city; that girl you saw was a - [Whispers],"" found in Act II."
3,With Regrets,"This reviewer has always thought highly of authoress White's writing, especially ""Mockingbird in the Moonlight"". Yet, ""Distant Hearts"" simply did not appeal. DH is a curious mix: It is a tale of a young New Orleans woman who travels to a relative's house in rural Georgia, ostensibly to pursue a writing project. Instead she becomes embroiled in small town politics while organizing and collating some old family Civil War era diaries that form the base of her task. That's about it. Perhaps this New York City resident missed something but the view from here is that Ms. White has simply done superior work-and evoked better Deep South atmosphere- in her previous books. On a positive note, production values are high with DH, as they usually are with Ms. White's works. DH is nicely packaged with highly professional layout and typesetting. These little things still matter and deserve mention."
5,Good plot for first novel,"I've read Jackie's true crime books and enjoyed them. This is her first novel which is about a young woman working on a college thesis. Jill Barnes, the protagonist, steps into Civil War history by reading the diaries of a young woman whose life becomes enthralling, complex and then connected to Barne's family history. She finds herself embroiled in small town drama while living with a boyfriend's aunt, the eccentric and lovable Montine ""Monty"" Westbrooks.The novel has it all: intrigue, suspense, surprises and romance...true to White's writing nature and that is- the genteel Southern touch!White does a skillfull job at keeping the plot moving along well and I found Distant Hearts to be great summer reading."
5,Very Hard to Find,"Flannery O'Connor is the epitome of Christian writing; taking everything you think should distiguish her as such and turning it on its head. She writes with purpose and your job is to decipher the theology she has packed into her incredible stories. Summarizing her own work she wrote, ""I once wrote a story called Good Country People. in which a lady Ph.D. has her wooden leg stolen by a Bible salesman whom she has tried to seduce. Now, I'll admit that, paraphrased in this way, the situation is simply a low joke. but without ceasing to appeal to him and without making any statement of high intention, this story does manage to operate at another level of experience, by letting the wooden leg accumaulate meaning."" O'Connor's stories sound at times like a bad joke and yet they pack her theology, her world view- her Christian view, into every character and story so that her stories continue to accumulate meaning upon the second and third reading."
4,not for the faint of heart or mind,"I have always enjoyed Flannery's work. It's violence. It's portrayal of archaic (hopefully) racial issues. Her work is a tapestry of hate, history, social commentary and so on. One must look beyond the situational to the intent.I have recommended her work to many friends and realtives. The response is just as unpredicatable as the artist's words. Some have thanked me for the introduction, some have requested that I never recommed anything else to them.I still stand by my opinions of this truly eccentric literary mastermind."
4,A Good Man is Hard to Find,"I chose this book as a way to explore writing beyond my usual choices and because I was told that some of the subject matter was rather horrific. Well written horrific. The gothic and graphic themes of this collection of stories means that it is not for the faint of heart, but no one can deny the craft of Flannery O' Connor's writing. This is for anyone who does love the macabre."
3,Not a simple bedtime story,"This is not a story to read before trying to sleep, the images that O'Connor creates engage the mind hours after you have finished the last story. the reader wonders: what the heck is her point? How do her characters come to their ""moment of grace?"" How are these seemingly grotesque figures connected to reality? The reader who only looks for a good story will be greately disappointed with O'Connor's works. Only those with an eye for the deeper aspects of love, nature, grace and faith will truly appreciate O'Connor's tales. Note to all, however, they are very disturbing, do not read to children!"
4,Excellent and creepy,Excellent. I read A Good Man is Hard to Find back in high school and have been disturbed by it ever since. O'Connor certainly had a knack for describing her characters and making a perfectly innocent sound story take a turn for the macabre with the reader barely noticing the change.
4,A Southern Story Classic,"This is a well-written collection of short stories. O'Connor draws on the southern tradition of writing (similar to Eudora Welty). The writing is simple, and dialogue is flawlessly written. Recommended."
5,Fun and Simple To Follow Guide to the Vast CIty,"Time Out New York (TONY) , which is updated annually, is a MUST for anyone visiting the city. The first chapter is a concise and fascinating history of New York, outlining important events throughout its vast history. Proceeding through this indespensible guidebook, you'll find detailed information about where to stay, eat, and drink, and the places and events not to miss in each neighborhood of the vibrant city. Because the guide is written by locals, the recommendations and warnings are pertinent and current from people ""in the know,"" who astutely guide residents and visitors through the maze that would be overwhelming without this terrific guide. Each place listed also has address, phone, and often websited listed, as well as prices and review. The maps in the back of the book are easy to read and the book is well organized and indexed"
2,Not Absorbent,This was supposedly a $25 towel reduced to $9.99 and advertised as extremely absorbent. I found them to be anything but. Towels almost repel moisture rather than absorb. Not a good buy..
4,Very soft and absorbent!,"I have only used these towels once, but they are very soft and surprisingly absorbent. When I first received these towels, I washed 8 bath towels and hand towels together. There was quite a bit of shedding in the dryer as they completely filled the lint filter and needed a second dry cycle to completely dry. Having done that, I did not notice any shedding while using the towel and I have to say it was quite a bit softer than the towels I was replacing (Royal Velvet).[...]"
1,crap in stick form sold in a package,couldn't hold air on a wall on calm day while indoors.requires a great deal of putty to hold up posters which allows a great deal of movement afterwards essentially allowing poster to gap from the walls.best use of this product would be to make a store look full - as it should be best left on the shelf.
4,Looks great but watch directions...must hand wash or dryclean,This worked great for what I was using it for but I need to find something that can be machine washable for my quilts. Still looking.
5,Mesmerized,"I was initially drawn to this book because I've always been curious about a woman who could make the songs that Nina made -- particularly in the manner that she made them. Now, after reading and learning of the 'story behind the story' - I can only say that I'm mesmerized beyond recognition and more in love with Nina than ever! This is a powerful read of a woman that followed her spirit - good and bad. Her gift - her voice - her passion - will live forever - and it should!"
4,great book!,This was a great book. We read it for our book club and everyone enjoyed it. It was also easy reading.
4,"Classes, conspiracy, and death.","11th Century Japan is not the normal setting for most historical novels set in the Land of the Raising Sun. While samurai, monks, and nobles still plot and plan within the Imperial Court tea is yet to have become the common drink and the whole feel of Japanese life, while familiar, still seems a tad off, not as orderly. While much of the time is spent by Sugawara Akitada in the Imperial University trying to solve one crime he soon finds himself in the middle of many evil deeds. Are all they linked together or is he just unlucky enough to have stumbled upon more than one criminal act? The confusion slows down the plot a tad, which is why I took away a star, but that is the only flaw within the pages of this book. Buy it used or new. And if you enjoy it, like I did, then go find the others, like I plan to."
4,"Story great, quality poor","This book has a great story line and holds your interest. It is the first book I have read by this author but not the last. The only drawback I saw was the actual physical quality of the book. The first time I opened the paperback, the binding broke and has grown increasingly worse. May be better in hardback.Rashomon Gate"
3,I prefer the Judge Dee stories,"I think this author borrowed heavily from Robert van Gulik's famous Judge Dee mysteries, but she lacks that author's ability to make the past seem real. For some reason, I didnt find this story believable, mostly due to the dialog, which seemed very contemporary and Western. The story unfolds oddly, and one wonders how the main character could know so much so quickly. If I werent already familiar with Judge Dee, and if I were a young person in junior high or high school, I'd probably enjoy this book much more. It reads like a romance story."
3,Decent Mystery Read,"Below is somewhat a similar review I gave for the Dragon's Scroll because both books are consistently similar.Cutting to the chase, this is simply a good quick read, nothing more. It is the perfect book to read at the beach or on a plane. The writing is not very deep, vivid or profound. Despite how this book is promoted, do not expect to learn a lot about ancient Japan nor culture. Do not expect this to be a book about samurais since the period portrayed is before the age of the samurai. Do not even expect a classic intense mystery thriller since it becomes obvious early on who did the crime. Instead expect a book that goes out of its way to explain the class differences between nobility and peasants.Despite all of this, I found it enjoyable only because the setting was interesting. However as in Dragon Scroll, if it wasn't for the sexual references, I still feel the writing of this book would be more appropriate for young adults.Still, its good quick read."
5,Addictive... be warned!,"Great historical fiction meets mystery novel. Fantastic writing, characters so realistic you will feel like you know them, mysteries that aren't completely obvious right away and keep you hooked to the end even if you have figured it out. Refreshing and enjoyable. When you buy this book, you might as well add another from the series to your cart to save yourself another trip to Amazon because you will want to know more! And yet a complete book by itself, no jaw grinding inducing cliff hangers at the very end, allowing the satisfaction of a complete story."
4,Like a cut-rate Judge Dee,"I really enjoyed this book...the author is clearly trying to emulate the Judge Dee novels, which are favorites of mine. However, Parker needs to pay more attention to the dialog between the characters. At times, it reads like a script from an old Bowery Boys movie! That aside, can't wait for the next one."
3,Decent Japanese Mystery,"A pretty good whodunit set in 11th century Japan. Akitada Sugawara, a minor clerk from the Ministry of Justice, initially endeavors to solve a blackmail plot at the Imperial University. But shortly thereafter he becomes drawn into a series of seemingly unrelated multiple murders. A nobleman of high integrity and with a penchant for solving crimes, Akitada finds himself entangled in a mysterious web of treachery and conspiracy.Author IJ Parker does a fairly decent job keeping the storyline moving with very few dead spots. The feudal Japanese setting is befittingly presented but the characters' behavior and dialogue seemed to be more contemporary Western than colloquial Eastern. And, at times, the action and the dialogue got a bit corny. However, this shouldn't overly dissuade readers from enjoying this engaging tale."
2,would not recommend,Husband did not care for these at all...felt that the quality was not there nor the ability to actually cancel out noises.
2,first time writing a review ...,I had a pair of Soul earbud headphones SL99. After a month of use the wire at the jack become lose and at times the sound in the ear earbud would cut out. So I ordered the Sony MDRNC22 with high hopes! ... Damn! the sound quality is weak compared to the Soul headphones! Plus the canceling feature is a fluke...really minimal difference in blocking out surrounding sounds. So the moral of the story is that I now greatly appreciate the sound quality of my original head phones and I found an easy way to fix them... simple no soldering gold plated stereo replacement audio jack at radio shack... google it!I hope this posting was helpful!
2,Sony Noise Canceling Earbuds,"Not very happy with my Sony noise cancelling earbuds (MDR-NC22). Firstly, when I turn it on, it has to be in the OFF section, and to turn off, I have to push it to the ON section. You can hardly see the tiny little light indicating if it's on or not. After leaving the earbuds in my ears for a period of time (an hour) it'll start to hurt my ears. And, the rubber part doesn't really keep the outside noise out very well.I have an older Sony model (MDR-NC11) and the noise cancelling on them is much more effective than my newer model. However, the volume does not work well on my iPod."
4,as previous reviews,previous reviews stated this item has a small but definitely noticeable background hiss and that noise reduction not as good as some but equal or better than anything in same price range...both are true...a good value and performs as it should
1,RETURNED,I'VE RETURNED THIS PRODUCT. DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS WHITE WITH PINK ON IT.STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE CREDIT FROM THE VENDOR
2,Should have listened to review about fit,"I had an older model that worked very well. They had a different shape that sealed well in the ears. I wouldn't take a flight without them. I lost them on my last flight and bought this new version to replace them. I was very dissappointed. I have small ear canals, and the body impedes the earbud's insertion and seal in the ear. The headphones do not work properly without an effective seal. If I try to push them in far enough to get a seal, then the hard part of the earphone body hits the ear and will become painful."
4,Very effective,"I purchased these to use while weed eating or lawn mowing and they work nicely for that. External noise is damped well enough for me to hear clearly without blasting out my eardrums. My only difficulty is keeping the plugs in my ears. They tend to fall out at inconvenient times, but this is still a huge improvement over the headphones I was using previously."
1,Disappointed,"So far haven't been on a plane with this earphone, but on a train, there was no noise cancelling function. We heard everything as loudly with the cancelling feature on as with it off -no difference- and the noise level was pretty high. I may try to return it."
3,Hmmmm.....,"My Freestyle Lite 28-guage lancets were killing my fingers. After reading the reviews here, I didn't want to wait to try these 33-guage lancets. The box said they would work with my Freestyle Lite lancet device, so I bought a box at my local drugstore to give them a try. Is the needle in this lancet thinner than those in other lancets? Yes, indeed; very obvious when you look at them side-by-side. BUT....the needle is also longer than that in the Freestyle lancets, and went deeper into my finger using the Freestyle lancet device. OWWWWW! Perhaps these BD lancets would be less painful in another lancet device, but NOT in the Freestyle. Too bad you have to buy a whole box of 100 in order to find out how it will perform in your lancet device."
3,Almost pain free,"Don't feel much pain when using these but they're too pricy, in my opinion! I went back to using the cheaper ones with the fatter needle. Yes, it hurts but it's more practical."
3,Worth the price,The product has done justice to the price I paid for it. I've been using this for quite some time now and have no major complaints.
3,No expiration date,This is the first time I purchased these. I bought them with the TrueTest Starter kit. There is no expiration date on the box for these. Do I just assume a date after opening?
5,Great Value,These fine gauge lancets seem to pierce my thick calloused skin with less effort and pain. Great price and product!
5,Cheap price long expiration date,Cheap price long expiration date what else can I say to say it was a good deal. Give them a try.
5,These are great!,"I love these lancets because they are so thin, you can hardly feel the poke. Also, the 100 count is great so I don't have to order as often. Best of all, the box opens to create an easy to despense bin for quick and easy access to the lancets."
5,Great!,"After researching many testers and supplies, these were the best for the price and I received them and they worked perfectly. Why pay more?"
5,Great book!!!!,"Steve explains in an engaging and reader-friendly style how conflict with the Lord can be a sign of a healthy relationship with Him, and how by wrestling with the Almighty we are brought closer to Him. Steve talks about searching for God when He isn't particuarly visible, struggling with difficult truths about God, and frustration with God when something tragic happens. All of these are examples of wrestling with Him. Steve then goes on to show how biblical figures wrestled with God. This book is both entertaining and enlightening, and I thoroughly recommend it to everyone."
2,Disappointed,"Although the content of the book was good, the characters did not come to life. There was little reference to physical character traits, eyes, gestures, color of hair, ditinguishing features, etc. There was a lot of conversation, though. After waiting the entire book to meet Kit's husband, he arrived with a few sentences. The climax at the end when the quilt was sold at an auction, we are only told that the quilters looked at the man.This book was very unsatisfying to me."
4,MAKES YOU THINK,"Ever since meeting Lauraine Snelling at a writers conference a few years ago, I look forward to an opportunity to read one of her books. I just finished The Healing Quilt. It's a powerful story. My daughter is 18, and the possibility of someone so young going through breast cancer had never occured to me.Perhaps because of my daughter's age, I strongly identified with Kit's struggle with the loss of her daughter. The synergy of the quilting group brings each woman through her loss to healing. I might not make the same decisions--but the growth reflects the characters we come to know in the book. It made me long for a simpler lifestyle, where I could volunteer for community events and spend time with friends.Read The Healing Quilt. You will meet yourself in one or more of the women."
1,"Obvious, badly plotted, and tired characters","This book was awful in so many ways. The tone was obnoxiously preachy; the characters and situations cliched. I think most 12 year olds could write characters that were more interesting and real. Worse that a TV sitcom, only without any laughs. The plotline could not have been more obvious. Most offensive is the young wife who solves major depression by just being honest and forgiving herself for her past ""mistake"". The simplistic solutions for all the problems brought up are insulting. This fiction is medically, emotionally, and spiritually unsound! I wish I had not wasted the time to read it."
1,Too bad...,"I got the sample of this book for my Kindle. I love doing that; it let's me read enough of the book (usually) to decide whether it's interesting enough to want to buy. But, this one had more spelling errors than any one I can remember, so I won't be buying it. Too bad too; it looked really good. But I can't get into any book where there are so many mistakes all I do is get mad and can't get into the story. :-("
1,What a mess...,What a mess... took 4 weeks to get to me. It was supposed to be a NEW rock hammer. It came in all scraped up and the coating is missing in a few places. Stickers have been removed and replaced. Handel is sticky from previous sticker placement. This is the third thing I have purchased through Amazon that has showed up in bad condition. Most likely not a bad hammer just a bad seller.
5,Excellent Shoes,"My wife and I discovered these shoes at a local shop - now we will buy no others for our son. Every pair of See Kai Run shoes we have purchased have been wonderful. They are very easy to get on and off. Stylish. Durable (a little wear and tear is expected). And fit him well. We regularly receive compliments and/or inquires on where to find these shoes. If you are fortunate enough to get a pair for your son/daughter, remember where you got yours."
1,PU....,"This is supposed to represent the world of spies? The only good thing was the historical spy stories. Everything else got lost in some B-movie ""sci-fi"" cliché. A toned downed James Bond idea would have appealed to kids, this just does not work. My 8 year old knows what a spy does, and this 'aint it!!!"
3,Lot of talking without much being said,"I enjoy Sylvia's work but this CD was a lot of generalized talking without very much meaning behind it. If you took all the important information and put it together it would only take up about 10 minutes on the CD, the rest is blabber."
1,This woman is a FAKE!,"What a waste of time is listening to Sylvia Browne. She should be ashame of the way she fools people. Please do not waste your time!!!I got this audio Book from my local library because of all the great reviews I found in amazon, which now don't make any sense at all. Sylvia Browne is a cold reader, a fake, a person that takes advantage of naive people. Nothing she has ever predicted has come to be true. Please people do some research before believing so blindly."
3,live session,This was a live session which did not differ from listening to Sylvia on TV. Did not cover as much information as I had expected. Sylvia is still amazing as a pyschic.
4,"Angles, Guides, and Ghosts",This CD was great because you listen to Sylvia herself. It was a little short of subject matter and short listening time.
4,Sylvia,The book explained a lot of things and it was very interesting to read. The only problem I had was that I didn't get the DVD with the book. There was supposed to be one but it was gone. The DVD was supposed to help you reach your spirit guides. Love to read her books cause they are always very interesting an helpful.
1,what a stupid cd,"The ideas presented in this cd are not logical, nor is there any historical data to back them up. What a waste of money!"
2,"Works, but doesn't fit very well","It does what it's supposed to do, I get plenty of power to charge my cell phone, laptop and other devices I use in the car. However, I had a similar problem as the other reviewer. It is a VERY tight fit in the 12v socket of my 2001 Honda Civic. Though I didn't pull the whole assembly out of my car like he did, I do have to pull with enough force that it warps the plastic around the socket, it makes me very nervous every time I pull it out. Luckily I never really have to take it out of the 12v socket but if you plan on removing this from the socket regularly I would definitely recommend against buying this item."
1,Broke my car's 12v adapter!,"Tried to plug this into my car's 12v adapter. While putting it in, it was a very tight fit.Then when I pulled it out, it pulled out the entire 12v adapter assembly out of the car, basically destroying it and messing up my car!I have used my car's 12v adapter with other devices and this had never happened before.I really dislike this product."
2,Loud fan noise/too tight a fit/fan now broke,I'm coming up on the 6 month anniversay with this and the fan noise has now gone from obnoxious to really annoying - the fan must be dying - I can't imagine what trouble there will be if the fan stops working (do they really generate that much heat? I guess I'll find out). Even when the fan worked correctly I can't believe how much noise it made.I agree with the others about how tight the fit is when inserted. I too am waiting to pull the whole ligher plug right out of the dash.
1,A Poorly Made Film,"I ordered this film to show to high school social studies students. Big mistake. The visuals are composed exclusively of the type of dull illustrations seen in old history textbooks, many of them black and white, with a lot of repetition. The narrator is not a professional; my guess is that he is the producer of this film. His voice is monotonous; he sounds like he's reading from a long, dull term paper. The music is rather dull chamber music. This was so boring, even I had trouble paying attention, and I think Thomas Jefferson is a fascinating historical figure.I don't know what the producer of this film thought he was creating or who he though his audience is, but the result, this tepid and monotonous film, is certainly not worthwhile."
1,not good,"This book has cute pictures of babies doing signs but there are no pictures of the objects the baby is signing. for milk there is just a picture of a kid signing milk but no picture of milk so babies won't be making any connection between the sign and the object or idea it is meant to represent. It's a board book so it should be something a baby can ""read"". My baby, who isn't by any means an avid signer, will look at pictures in non-signing books and do the signs she knows. ""Word Signs, a first book of signs"", is a far better choice for her because it has pictures of say, an apple or socks, plus a small diagram of how to sign it."
2,Way too basic,I was disapointed that this book was so basic. It had a lot of potential but was a real dud. I'm sure there are others out there that are more useful.
5,"Dont listen to ""Grandma""","This movie was ALOT of fun and has all the elements of circa 1960'sweirdness/creepiness that I love watching. It is the imperfection these films possess that make them so enjoyable to watch. The funniest part of the film is when the scientists first examine Frankenstein and they insist that ""He is distinctly caucasian"" when its soooo obvious that he is Asian!If you liked ""War of the Gargantua's"" ""Matango"" and even ""Gorgo"", you will also love this movie as well. I must admit that I like ""War of the Gargantua's"" better, and I hope that is soon released to DVD."
3,One I saw in the theater as a kid,A fun japaneese monster movie that I remembered as a kid. It is a bit different than the old godziller movies. This one seems to be a bit more Americanized than that. It surely holds your interest. How it can grow from the heart of the matter.
4,Good movie- DVD case was totaled,Maybe it was just a fluke but I ordered two DVDs at once and both DVD cases were basically shot to hell when I received them. All cracked up with pieces of plastic falling off. I don't know who's to blame for that... But the important thing was the actual DVD and it was fine.The main reason I bought this was because Kumi Mizuno has a pretty big role.
4,NOT Mascara,"I didn't like this product at first because I was expecting it to be like mascara. It's actually pretty neat though. It tints the eyelashes without the thick, clumpy mess you get with traditional mascara. It does so lightly though, so it's probably not a good choice for a night out on the town. Good for an occasion when you want very light makeup."
1,Obfuscate MFC,"This is by far the most confusing book about MFC I have ever read. If you want to understand MFC- Don't read this book, It will only confuse you. The examples are confusing, and the descriptions are confusing. The Author clearly believes he is an expert in C++, but all other books on the subject are better.Do Not buy this Book"
1,Don't buy!,"This is the worst set of phones--constant static and, after approx. 6 months of use, the batteries don't last more than a few hours at a time. Waste of money."
1,Worst phones ever,These are terrible phones. They crackle and have a large amount of background noise. The Caller ID menu does not display well either. Maybe they interfere with our wireless network. There is no clear channel on them. They are pretty much unusable. I didn't pay much for them but it was all wasted.
3,OK phone,Standard featured cordless phone with caller ID. Wished volume went up a little more. Sometimes picks up bursts of interference - not sure if the phone is at fault.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"I bought this phone 6 months ago and I wish I had kept the recept so I could return it. First off, you can not keep it on the charger or the battery will only allow you to talk for 20-30 minutes before dying. When it dies it will give you a couple of beeps notice then it shuts off. If you do not hang up before it shuts off then your phone line is unusable. You actually have to unplug the phone from the phone line just to recieve or call on other phones. I have never heard of this happening before and my friends and family are tired of talking to me only to hang up on them without warning because my phone is beeping and I know I only have a few seconds to hang up or risk losing my phone line for hours. I would have given this phone zero stars if I could have. I would recommend spending a few extra dollars and go with another expandable system. Don't make the same mistake I made."
1,Boring beyond belief,"I know this is a well respected book but in all honesty I found it to be very repetitious and boring. There are only so many times you can listen to complaints about colic and very similar sounding births before you get bored to tears. While writing the history of ordinary people is important, Ballard lived a boring and uneventful life. Unless you want to hear about the stories of dozens of births steer clear. And i'm a phd student used to dry books."
1,SnoozeFest.com,"I HATE this book. I had to read it for a Gender & Women's Studies class and I couldn't wait for it to be over, but the more I read, it seems like the longer & more boring the book got. I ended up not even finishing because I couldn't take reading one sentence. I'll admit that the movie was not as boring as I thought it would be, but I seriously don't understand what would possess someone to read this book for fun.--Like who's into this type of stuff? & like seriously Ulrich, hundreds & hundreds & hundreds of pages were NOT needed & that's not my ADHD talking.I'm only on here to sell this crap because our rip off bookstore will only give me $1.50 for something that I should have never bought in the first place.-__-My grandma's book club probably wouldn't even read this book.I pray all of you hit Netflix & watch the movie because this book will make fall asleep & fall asleep fast."
3,Historic account of midwifery,I've enjoyed this book however it's a bit long winded though. I particularly was interested in hearing more about her midwifery experiences and would have liked to hear more about this.
1,Blah.,"Thatcher herself said, on page 9, that ""it is in the very dailiness, the exhaustive, repetitious dailiness, that the real power of Martha Ballard's book lies."" It seems to me that it takes a certain person to grasp this power and enjoy this type of book. I on the other hand don't have enough of imagination to make up for what this book lacks. -Ashley Trout, Washington DC"
1,Midwife's tale,This was probably the most boring story I have ever read.Could not get get past chapter twoMaybe it is historical and interesting for some but our entire book club was not impressed.
4,get a glass of water!,"There are parts of this book that are so dry. Yet, there are parts that are so wonderful. The editor should have edited!"
3,Review of A Midwife's Tale The Life Of Martha Ballard,"I actually was a bit disappointed when I read the book. I thought it would have more of the actual diary entries, and less of the author's interpretations of what Martha was trying to say. I think if it had, it would have been a much more interesting read."
2,Midwife's Tale,the book is very boring for my taste but its essential for what you may have to study for the class.
3,Midwifery,"The book itself was in good condition, however, I was looking for more information on what she actually did while delivering children during this time period. More of a 1st person account of what she faced."
5,5 Star,"I originally bought this book years ago at a gift shop in Concord, MA. I loaned it out to someone and it was never returned. I loved this book enough to purchase it again a few weeks ago. I highly recommend this book, but you must buy your own copy as I will never loan this one out again. ;-)"
4,An amazing story,"This book is essentially an annotated diary of a woman who lived and worked in late 18th century New England. It provides a fascinating look at life in that time as well as medical and social standards of the day. Martha's main ""profession"" is that of a midwife. She's a prolific and popular woman who attended to over 800 births during her working years. Not only midwifery, but all sorts of other medical problems were addressed by Martha. Lots of births and lots of deaths in those days!Although I have enjoyed the book, I think one would need to have a high interest in either medicine of that time or general life in Revolutionary America. Absent that, I think you'd find the book rather tedious. All in all, it's an amazing story of an amazing woman. I liked it!"
5,Chuck,Very good book came on time as described ## ### ### ## ### ## ## #### ### ## ## ### #### ## #####
2,Absolutely terrific and important work,"Please disregard the 2 stars in the rating. It is a 5 star book. The system automaticaly put 2 stars and would not let me change it.I can't say enough about how wonderful this book is and how much I enjoyed reading it. This book would be a wonderful gift for anyone in the medical profession. It is a fascinating account of an amazing woman facing the challenges of life in early Maine as well as the every day facts of life necessary for survival. She contributed immensely to life itself as she was the midwife to hundreds of, if not more, women and the birth of their children.For myself, I used it as a genealogical tool because that is the area of the country where all of my ancestors came from. It is facinating to know the trials and tribulations as well as the joys of our ancestors.Priscilla PaulMemphis"
2,Quality is not so good.,"Before I bought this set I've already bought 12 set from KNG for my daughter's coming birthday party. KNG only sell their items in multiples of 6. Since I only needed three more sets so I took the risk to order this one to save few dollars.I am not pleased with its quality at all, very thin, very see through and the color is not pure white. I should have just order 6 more from KNG!!! Children's chef hat from KNG is $3.06 and apron is $2.62 as of September 2009. The quality is great.Now I am not sure I want to give this chef hat and apron to any of my daughter's friends. They look too cheap, especially compare to the other brand. I might just use the hat, and get three more aprons from the local craft shop.[...]"
2,Not what I expected!!,Fabric very light weight. Sizing for older kids only--not what I expected. Disappointing.
4,great combo,"I ordered this set for my daughter's cooking birthday party. It is perfect, because I can customize them for each child as their party favor!"
2,Cute But Sent Them Back,"It's tough to order shoes on the internet. You never really know what they will look like or how they will fit until you've already handed over your money & they arrive at your door. I ordered these boots in the Stone color. Not a color I would normally buy & I wasn't sure what I would wear them with but they were really cute and I just couldn't say no to the price. When I got them, the color was ok--they would be cute with jeans. And they were really comfortable, BUT--they looked like they had been rubbed with something dirty. I don't think this was the look that was intended. Wherever the boot was creased or folded in the box were dark lines/rub marks. Not really a good look especially if you're worried about keeping them clean in the first place."
4,Beautiful boot,"Very fashionable with the front laces and easy to get into with the side zipper, this boot looks better in person than in the photo. The boot shaft fits my 14 inch calf comfortably with knee socks on, but has very little arch support."
2,Zipper broken,Loved the boots but it was really obvious that the zipper was broken and the item was suppose to have been inspected.
1,Poorly made,"Lasted about a week. The tightening straps would not stay tight. Threw away and had to buy another, higher quality arm guard."
4,Pittsburgh's Finest,Myron is unquestionably the king of Pgh. Reading this book brought back a ton of fond memories from when I lived in the 'Burg. I highly recommend to anyone who has Pgh ties or is at all familiar with Myron.
1,Avoid,"Lots of E-3 Errors. I end up throwing away over 30% of the test strips. Even after replacing recalled strips, glucose testing has too many errors, and will not give accurate readings."
5,A new twist to an old story,"This is by far one of the more fasinating stories I have read in long time. I really can't wait to read the rest of this series.Tauvaris J. Moore exposed a truth that is long forgotten and that is, there are a few good men left. This battle of the sexest story takes things to a whole new level. If I could say the one theme about this book is, don't trust perception, because things are not always what the seem to be. The forshadowing of things to come is gripping. I suggest that you pick this one up and keep up with the series. The authur plans to release the entire series this year. This three book series, seems to be headed to an explosive conclusion."
3,Whipped and Sprung,"I ordered the book because I was curious as to what the hype was all about. I purchased the book and received it a few days later. Had no problems with the shipping at all. The issue came with the book itself. I will admit, it has some potential but the book did not keep my interest. It talks about a group of friends and the things they go through within their relationships. Seems like the standard issues everyone goes through but there was no real substance to the book. In my opinion it was a good read but nothing I would recommend be read at/for a book club. NEO_SOUL_06"
4,Bouncing Buddha!,"Quite the cute Buddha and my wife is going to love him bouncing on the dash of her car! I envisioned him a bit smaller so I was surprised when I opened the shipment and saw how big he is! I guess I need to pay better attention to the dimensional descriptions from now on! The size is not a problem though and all in all, a fine little item and I would certainly do business with this seller again! Thanks! Kehbe"
5,cool BUDDHA,looks great in on car dashboard. fun way to open up conversations about buddhism with people. and he shakes like crazy when im drivin down the road. got here quick .good company to deal with.
4,A reminder of how to live,Stressed out? A smiling bouncy Buddha can remind you to not take the present so seriously. He's a great traveling companion and is popular with the other occupants of the vehicle too.
4,I love it!,"Although I seriously doubt this is an accurate representation of the Buddha, this little guy serves as a constant reminder of mindfulness when I'm driving. I love it!"
3,Earnest but wretched,"The plot is so implausible it defies credibility, especially the idea that the main character, Lea, is so transformed that her former wife does not recognize her, even after a close conversation (when we, the viewers, easily recognize her in photos of her previous ""male"" self).I wonder why producers of films like this and ""Transamerica"" have to create transwomen characters who are so stiff, self-conscious, and utterly uncharming.The film is earnest and probably has some educational value for the mass audience. One good point it makes is that deception and avoidance winds up creating more pain for everyone in the long run.But overall, I found it depressing, dull, and the usual stereotypes."
3,Bulky,"Unlike their plastic cousins, these hangers are built to last a life time. Only problem is, the clips are very large and the hanger takes up more room than I was looking for."
1,"BUYERS, BE AWARE.","I had 2 DVD players made by Pioneer. They are nice machines... for a little over a year. Then the warranty expires. The problem these players seem to have has to do with poorly designed dual laser pick up (one - for DVDs, the other one - for CDs and Video CDs). The first player I had stopped playing CDs and Video CDs, I got the other one - this one stopped playing DVDs.On the positive side - the picture is very good, so if you are after a short-term buy go ahead, otherwise look for another brand."
2,No VCD or DVD+R support,This is a very dissapointing unit. The error correction is lousy.If your CD is lightly scratched you are out of luck with this player.It does not support VCD's (they say they did on the manual).Also no support for DVD+R.
4,Sound better that it looks,"This player has advanced picture and sound quality for its price. It out performs JVC and Toshiba in the mid-low price market because it has higher picture resolution and better sound. It is certainly true in this case that a mid-price DVD player can sound better than some pricier CD players (I am comparing it to Nakamichi SS-8b). Only some audio specialist brands like Rotel and NAD have CD players that sounds better than this DVD mechine. The remote is adquate, but not great. I examined the components inside the player and found that the design is very clean and economical, and the quality of this player is better than how it looks from the outside."
3,Pioneer DV 525 is merely OK,"I gave this players every chance before taking it back recently. I have 5 DVD players and have a very good grasp of features and performance. The Pioneer DV525 picture is it's downfall in my opinion. Compared to Toshiba, Sony, Proscan, Philips and Panasonic the picture appears very dark. Even though it offers different setting for cinema, animation and normal there was little change to the picture overall. The audio was adequate but not up to par with other models. The nice features are CD-R,CD-RW, VCD and PAL/NTSC playback which is rare among players. Why did it go back? It simply stopped reading discs after exchanging it TWICE after only a week of playing. The quality is apparently the problem here and may start with it's very cheap design. You can do a lot better with a Toshiba product or the newly released Philips (invented DVD)which have improved dramatically."
3,Pioneer DV525 DVD Player,"I purchased this player after reading glowing reviews at Amazon. Although the picture quality is great, I had tremedous tracking problems in the middle of viewing the MATRIX. The sound levels really fluctuate widely with voices low and sound effects and music way too loud. And the remote is terrible. The buttons are so small I have to put on my reading glasses to use it."
2,Not So Great,"Okay, so I purchased this with low expectations. The first movie was funny because of how horrible it was, but this was truly bad! Same characters...good. Same plot bad."
1,Bad movie,"I bought this movie because I like Robyn Sidney, who I met and actually had a conversation with at Comic Con. She had a very small part in the movie, and it is a bad movie. Goofy plot and bad acting. Save your money"
3,"Equal To The First ""Bong""","Evil Bong 2: King Bong is pretty much like the first Evil Bong, so if you liked that one you should like this one too. And if you didn't like the first one, you won't like this one either. It's funny...up to a point. The first half has plenty of hilarious moments, most of them involving a foul-mouthed Grandpa. However, it loses steam in the second half."
4,cool book,"This is a really very cool book, although you need a fair bit of the Sandman background for it all to make sense - I first read it when I'd only read the 'The Kindly Ones' sequence and some of it went over my head. Then I got the rest and suddenly quite a lot of things became clear...It loses a star cause there's no actual Gaiman stories (although his comments at the start of each book are nearly as interesting as the stories - 'what Gandalf's rock'n rolling younger brother would look like if he were secretly a pirate' is a truly funky description for anyone).For me the best are the Barbara Hambly, 'Stopp'd Clock Yard' and the 'Ain't you the most done' stories - the collection does veer pretty wildly between cool, cute 'n funky and seriously weird / sick.... Depends what you like. Like the comics, don't let children read it."
2,A real letdown,"Considering the quality and creativity that were displayed in the sandman comics I expected this book to be a real stand out. Unfortunately almost all of the stories were retread formulatic snoozers.Maybe I expected too much from the book but I couldn't, in good faith, recommend the hardcover to anyone. If you must have it wait a few months until it is discounted to under $5."
2,Not much of a cook book.,The book was a as described and don't expect more. If you have experience with beer can cooking this book will add nothing new to your talents.
2,Misprint,"I ordered this book as a Xmas gift - great idea, but unfortunately I was sent a misprinted one (about 30 pages are upside down) and since I had to ship it to my Dad, there was no time to return / exchange it. Especially during the Xmas season, you might want to double-check whether or not you're mailing out defective items.Other than that, great little book :)"
3,Just what I ordered....,"No more...no less. I had had a similar product from some number of years ago and when I saw this one, wanted to replace the earlier lost one."
5,BBC cook book,I have used this book for years! It has the best recipes for Chicken and Turkey. Done it a hundred times all with great success. So when a friend in Israel asked about it- i had to buy him one as well. Perfect family BBQ gift.
5,Great Cookbook!,My husband has made a few of the recipes out of this book and loves it! Easy enough to follow and great food!
1,A little book of very little content,"I like the author's Barbecue Bible for its depth and diversity of recipes, but this little book is nowhere near his earlier work. There are a few decent Beer-Can Chicken recipes, though we have seen them before in other grilling books. Then there are some awful variations, like Root Beer Game Hens, and random stuff such as Grilled Prunes. This book is more about the joke of a chicken perched on a can than it is about food you would want to serve to your friends. It's not worth the price."
3,Good Idea - But No Use Yet,"Sounds good, but I haven't pulled the recipe book out of the cabinet yet. Does this mean something?"
4,Good Grilling Cookbook,"This is a handy guide for anyone looking to find new recipes for your gas grill. I love cooking on the grill, and this book provided some interesting varaitions on some old favorites. Not every recipe was 5 star, but none were terrible. I am certain there is something for everyone."
5,"Lovely, soothing bedtime story","WIth her usual eloquence, Rylant tells the fascinating story of the traditional names for the monthly moon. The text is spare, the pictures are stunning. This is a quiet book; it's more like poetry than a cute or funny kid's book. Children appreciate aesthetic experiences, too."
5,Satisfying,"I applaud Bollock's output here in this, her sadly out-of-print number. If you have any chance of laying your hands on Bollock's books, I implore you to do so. The books are first rate. When it comes to love and graduation novellas, Dickens's are OK, Elliot's are fine, but Bollock's are always best."
4,An Exciting Book For Kids,"This book covers two of Sindbad's seven voyages. Children who like exciting adventure stories will be thrilled by Sindbad's visit to the mysterious island that turns out be a gigantic whale, his ride on the talons of the great Roc, and his escape from the pit of vipers with pockets full of precious diamonds. The beautiful illustrations are bordered with motifs from Persian rugs, capturing the Arabian flavor of Shahrazad's tale."
3,Charming Art,"The art in this book is very charming, but we found the story-telling to be a bit stiff in places. Still, it's a great way to introduce younger children to Sindbad."
3,Not a Last Chance Workout,"If you are expecting a hard, challenging workout, look elsewhere. The contestants are smiling and laughing at the end of the cardio circuit workout, so you know it can't be that hard. I much prefer Jillian's Burn Fat Boost Metabolism DVD along with No More Trouble Zones. These are challenging 55 minute workouts. Also good are Biggest Loser Cardio Max and Power Sculpt. I sometimes use Biggest Loser Boot Camp, but it is hard on my knees. Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga is great for stretching and toning."
3,"The biggest loser- The Workout, The last chance workout. by Jillian Michaels","If you are a beginner this workout is really good, but if you are a seasoned fitness buff DON'T buy this video. I always expect Jillian's videos to be really hard and have been disappointed with everyone of them that I have bought, (excluding one) (and I own alot of them)! :("
1,very poorly done,"very disappointed with this dvd. she assumes that you watch the biggest loser show and gives very poor instruction prior to each workout. You find yourself a few seconds behind. you have to watch the people do the work out before you know what to do, so you lag behind. also question the wisdom of week 5-6 of doing the same workout out every day for 6 days a week for 2 weeks. i thousght you are suppose to rest muscles for 24-48 hours. like the original biggest loser dvd with bob. recommend jari love over this. barely broke a sweat"
3,Its ok,"I have been using No more Trouble ZOnes, Banish Fast Boost Metabolism and 30 Day Shred for more than a year with great results. I was excited to try something new from Jllian.. It is not such a great workout as the other dvds. More for someone just starting out. The contestants from the biggest loser really do not put their all into it and are uninspiring in this. But I find it to be ok to try once a week as my day off or on a lazy day. I really dislike the last set she does with all that floorwork, it puts alot of strain on my back"
3,Could be better.,I wanted to do a workout like they do to the contestants on the show. I didn't think this was any different or 'hardcore' than any other program I already have. It's only 'ok'.
3,Not My Favorite...,"I am disappointed with this dvd. I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan and own several of her workout dvds. I also love watching The Biggest Loser and was drawn to this specific dvd because of the title. I know how intense Last Chance Workouts appear on the show and was hopeful this would make me drip gallons of sweat too. Well, it didn't.This one just missed the mark for me. I had a very difficult time following the participants, many had sloppy form and they acted goofy throughout the video. It was not motivational. For someone new to exercising, I would not recommend this one. It's too easy to get hurt without proper form.Also, in order to feel like I really get a decent workout, I have to do all 3 segments back-to-back. I just don't feel the same burn as I do with the 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones."
3,Not nearly as hard as other Biggest Loser/Jillian Michaels workouts,"I own Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and Quick Trouble Zones as well as The Biggest Loser Cardio Max and Power Sculpt and this dvd isn't nearly as hard as some of those! If you can do BFBM or the Cardio Max dvd this workout will feel almost too easy. If you are beginner then something like this would be good but I use this video for my ""easy"" days and stick to the others when I really want to ""feel the burn"""
3,Not as difficult as I wish it would be,"I love Jillian Michaels workout videos, but I have to say that this is not one of her best. I expected that with a title like ""Last Chance Workout"" that I would be panting and trying to keep up. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I completed the entire workout using 5 lb. weights and was not nearly as out of breath as I was doing her ""30 Day Shred"" or her two newest videos. I also found the Biggest Loser contestants to be a little distracting. They were not always in sync and doing the moves properly. I'll throw this into my routine, but will not be using it as one of the staples."
5,Even my Eyebrows were Sweating!!,"Coming home from my freshman year at college, I was horrified to find that I had gained a whopping TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS! In a hot panic, and thinking there had to be a solution to my chubby cheeks, I went out looking for any workout DVDs that I could find.In a streak of luck, I found myself in the ""Biggest Loser"" aisle of Target, surrounded by such DVDs as ""The 30 Day Shred"", ""Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism"", and ""The Last-Chance Workout"". Knowing I had nothing to lose (but the weight), I bought all three.For the first month, I used the 30-day shred. The second, I used the Burn Fat Boost Metabolism, and for the third, I used the Last Chance Workout.Through it all, I lost all 25 pounds and I owe it all to these easy-to-follow DVDs! I'm not going to sugar-coat it, you will be sweaty, you will be yelling profanities at the television, and you will be out of breath.But you know what? You will also lose the weight.I wish you all luck!"
5,great weight loss dvd!,"i have been doing this workout 6-7 days a week for over 2 months and have lost 20lbs! i am extremely pleased with the results of this workout. it doesn't happen overnight, it takes time to lose the weight and there are times where its stagnant but then you start to lose again. i would recommend this video for anyone wanting to lose any weight and if you do it like she explains 6-7 days a week you WILL see results. all you need are 2 hand weights and you are ready to go! good luck!"
1,Such a disappointment!,"I have completed the first two days of this workout. Day one was a warm-up, the last chance workout and a cooldown. Day two consisted of the warm-up, upper body sculpt, lower body tone, and a cooldown. And I hate to say it... but this workout is terrible! The warm-up is not effective at all, the last chance workout was not difficult, and the upper and lower body sculpting sessions are easy even for beginners. Jillian does not participate in any of the workouts, and the contestants don't really seem like they know what they're doing, either. There are no explanations as to how to complete each move and nobody is moving in sync. This workout seems like it was thrown together in a few minutes. It is absolutely terrible, and the fact that Jillian Michaels used her image to market this item is astounding to me. If you're looking for a true Jillian Michaels workout, look elsewhere!"
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this thinking I'd get the ""last chance work out"" that they do on the tv show, well not so much. Jillian actually doesnt do much in the video at all (I'm used to her other videos where she atleast does a few of the reps to show form). The contestants arent really in sync which was annoying to me. All in all I didnt like this video at all. This actually discouraged me from purchasing any additional Biggest Loser workout videos."
5,Loved it!,"The Biggest Loser: The Workout - Last Chance WorkoutLoved it, Loved it, Loved it. I was afraid to do this at first because the contestants on the show look like they were in so much pain and under so much stress. However, I was totally able to keep up with Jillian and felt empowered after the workout. My first try was awesome. Looking forward to getting used to doing this workout over and over again."
2,One of the WORST!!,"I have all of the biggest loser work outs and i thought this being the last chance workout would be awesome. NOT!! It had terrible cuing, it was just bad."
1,Not good.,"Very bad work out DVD. Didn't get a work out at all, half the people in the DVD didn't even do the work out to the fullest, they seemed to half @$$ it. I don't recommend this DVD to anyone. If your looking for something super easy go with it, but if you want more of a challenge go with a different company other than Biggest loser. None of there videos actually challenged me."
4,Loving it!,"I first was introduced to this product through a co-worker of mine. The exercises on the video target most of the body, and as long as you tighten your core muscles, you get a good mid-section workout. One thing I would have liked out of this video is to have an abs isolation workout. It is an effective workout!"
3,Not as good as the Shred; Cardio Max or Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism,"I love Jillian, Bob, and most of the previous DVDs, but this one was not as challenging as many of the others. I also did not like the silly banter between Jillian and the contestants. Jillian is far more condescending to the contestants in this dvd than in others. She is much more professional when she is working out along with you, as in her other DVDs. I will do this workout from time to time to mix things up, but I will consistently go back to the 30 day Shred, Jillian Burn Fat/Boost Metabolism, and Biggest Loser Cardiomax."
4,A good workout,"I enjoy working out to this DVD, the only thing I wish it had was a specifc ab workout. Throughout the video she tells you to keep your abs engaged, but that's as much of a targeted ab workout that you will get. If you push yourself this workout is worth it."
5,LOVE this DVD,"I already have the 30 day shred DVD and it has helped me change my body and lose 25 lbs. and I still can't get through the whole Level 3 without modifying, but I was tired of it and wanted something new. I love Jillian's approach to training, her cardio/strength combinations are killer and I know they work, so I bought this DVD and I absolutely LOVE it!!! If you're just starting, it will be tough, do the modified versions, but soon you will be able to do it all the way through on the highest level. It has taken me to a whole new level of fitness and I'm still losing and toning. I'm 48 years old, have had 6 kids, and in better shape than in my 20's. BIG thumbs up!!!"
5,Jillian ain't no joke,If you're not serious about working out then don't get this video because it will sit on the shelf after the first viewing. You will definitely get your butt into shape with this one. Good luck.
2,ehhhhh,"Easy work out that doesn't feel like ""Last chance workout"". Too long and don't feel like I every get my heart rate up past the minimum"
5,Biggest Loser Last Chance Workout,"This is a great video - really gets the heart rate up and makes you feel as if you've been working out for a long period of time. Would highly recommend this video if you want a good, solid workout and need something to get your heart rate up and keep it up. Please there's something about Jillian yelling at you!"
3,OK.. will be my day off workout,"I don't consider myself really overweight.. maybe 10 lbs or so and I'm fairly active so I had higher hopes for this workout. I JUST finished the workout and yes, I was sweating but I expected to be panting, trying to catch my breath and on the verge of exhaustion. It just didn't happen. I have the BL Cardio Max, 30 Day Shred, Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism and I would pick this one last if I had to rate them on how much of a workout I got. I especially didn't like the last circuit, last exercise because the former contestants all did the move differently and none of them seemed correct. I think Jillian is more encouraging in other videos. I don't know... this one just didn't do it for me and I am a bit disappointed! I feel like I need to pop in another video to really get my workout now for the day."
5,LOVED it!,"I just recently purchased this Biggest Loser workout DVD 'Last Chance Workout' and I loved it. I thought it was tough, but still easy enough to follow and keep up with. I am the kind of person where if a workout video is too hard or advanced for me, I get real discouraged and frustated and just shut it off. Not this one. It kept me going and motivated, while giving you the option of modifying the moves if you are a beginner. I have about 80 lbs to lose, and believe me, I was sweating when this was done, but I felt such a sense of accomplishment that I could actually do this. I would recommend this to someone trying to lose weight. It keeps your heart rate up and there are great workout intervals. I gave it 5 stars."
2,blah,"graphics range from okay to even with options turned all the way up, voice acting really sucks, overall gameplay is crappy and unfinished. Actions are slow.It is one of those games where you constantly have to save people. If some moron npc walks onto your grenade you get to restart level - yay!This should of stayed vaporware."
2,Couldn't get passed the language,"I love David Tennant, but this was a terrible movie. Too much language. I didn't even finish it. Thumbs down."
2,Not credible,"Firstly, the undertaker hits on the American girl in an English graveyard and she falls for it. Then, when he stalks her all the way to LA, she doesn't call the cops, but instead goes on dates with him? Um, whether or not the acting here is bad, the plot has no credibility, even if it is a comedy. The Brit star is ok, sort of, but I grew weary after a third of this indie had played out."
1,Save Your Money!,"This CD/Book is totally useless. The small amount of information that is on it, plus a whole lot more, can be found online for FREE! ([...] is a wealth of free infomation) Not even beginners can benefit from this CD. All it contains are some bad photos of molded pieces that have been painted (polymer clay is seldom painted by people who us it because the clay comes in a rainbow of colors so it's not necessary) There are no secrets in this book as the title implies. However, among the questionable tips you'll find some miss-information. Forget it! Look through Amazon.com for a legitimate polymer clay book, or get the wonderful ""Tips and Techniques"" booklet from the National Polymer Clay Guild, or go online to [...], a non commercial site. Don't throw your money away on this dreadful publication."
1,Ugh.,Half of this stuff in this book can easily be found online for free. A quarter of it can be found in the inserts included when you buy polymer clay. The last quarter of it is stuff a new polymer clayer learns after spending five minutes with a brick of clay in their hand. Go for a different book. Donna Kato's book is great for new clayers.
1,Nothing secret,Save your money on this one. Nothing new or exciting. Even the most basic books will give you more hints on how to handle clay than this CD. And the fact that you need a computer makes it even more like work and less like fun. One star was generous.
1,Not even worth buying for Beginners,"It was money badly spent. The tips would never be used by anyone that would want to be a serious crafter. I was very dissappointed also at the way the CD was formatted, because if you would have wanted to print it, which it isn't worth doing, you would waste tons of paper as well the clay you ruined by adding sand. Your other ratings fooled me, but I will be more careful in the future about believing them."
1,do not buy this cd,"Not only will it not help you as a beginner but adding sand to your clay can ruin it!! and weaken it,not worth 2 cents.Go online and join polymer clay sites the people are more than willing to help you with tips and how to do it right for free."
5,Best Thing Ever,"What can I say except if you want a complete collection of Marvel's best then pick these items up while you still can. Marvel in their modern money grubbing, dirtbag selves are discontinuing the company who makes these as Marvel has released their online subscription service which has fewer comic issues than what is on each of these dvd-roms. Well worth the money and you don't have to deal with getting online someplace to view like Marvel's new ""idea"". While you are at it tell Marvel to allow this company to continue making these fine additions to anyone's comic collection."
1,beater,this was very confusing. i purchased this thinking it was the whole mixer with the beater since they have a pic. of the whole thing. they should only have the pic. of the beater tip.
3,Surprisingly fun.,"You play a red-bearded General, apparantly the only male in the whole land aside from two snarky, hooded weapons assistants and an elderly inventor. In each scenario you are provided with a castle (sometimes just a plot of land) and are instructed to destroy various other castles within a group of four feuding sisters. Simple concept, done pretty well.Mind you, this isn't a game to get engrossed in for the next week. It's a battlefield artillery game, straight-forward as that. You have to maintain walls (and protect the farmers who pay your taxes), research bombardments and magic, and deliver a whole lot of hurt.While it started there, this isn't exactly a port from PS1. The graphics are slightly improved (nothing astounding) but the controls are far easier and the gameplay is a little smoother with a few additional weapons and more (brief) cutscenes. Definitely a fun waste of an hour here and there."
4,Much better than expected,I have never seen these on TV and were just cuirous since I have seen the old cartoons. I must say that the news ones are really well made and the story is quiet interesting and different to the original story.
2,Not what I was looking for at all....,"The seller delivered the item and it arrived quicker than I expected. There was nothing about this that smelled like ""Lily of the Valley"", it smelled like baby powder. Was not a fan. Although I'm not sending it back (too much trouble--I'll just give it to someone), I ordered something else. The smell I was going for was Taylor of London's Lily of the Valley. My mom uses it and it smells so pretty and beautiful."
2,Smells good,The power smells good but I don't like the powder puff or the container that it came in. Both of these products are not very durable.
5,Great item,"This is a great item. Smells wonderful not overpowering but very delicate. Haven't had this powder since the 70s,great bit of nostalgia."
3,Not in love with the scent,"Perhaps I'm just not familiar with the true smell of Lilly's of the Valley, but I chose it because I perceived that it would be a light, not overly sweet or heavy scent. I was pleased in the the lightness, but perhaps it is ""not-sweet"" to the extreme. Maybe a touch sweeter would be nice. I'm still using it so it's not terrible, but I doubt I'll choose this fragrance of powder again. Of course, scent is so much in the nose of the beholder!"
4,Both enjoyable and difficult,Kiss Daddy Goodnight offers a clear picture of incest and sexual abuse. There are autobiographical accounts that tug on the heart strings. This book also brings hope and healing. One of the best autobiographies of incest I have read.
1,Leaks massive amounts of water,"This bottom guide leaks massive amounts of water in the gap between the two guides. Our shower head is parallel to the guide, with the inside door closest to the showerhead. Our walk-in shower is 40"" wide, but the spray from the showerhead, bouncing off our bodies as we shower, hits the inside shower door, travels down the inside edge, and then out through the middle opening of this guide."
5,Great Coffee/tea substitue!,"A couple years back I developed an intolerance to caffeine that sent me to the emergency room. I have been seaching for a substitute but nearly every similar product contains varying amounts of caffeine. Even decaf coffees and teas still contan a small amount of the drug. Two months back I ordered two 100 bag boxes of Windsor and it has been a great substitue for my morning coffee. I still miss that kick I got from my morning cup of coffee but that is one experience I do not wish to repeat.Coca tea has a very delicate taste but the taste is enhanced with a small amount of sugar is added. Honey has such a distinctive flavor of its own that it would totally mask the flavor of the coca tea.I spent over two years in Bolivia with the Peace Corps and the tea brings back fond memories of my days in that country.Would I purchase the product again? Yes! In fact, I have already ordered two more boxes."
5,"Windsor , mate De Coca","Much has already be said about this fine product and it would be hard toadd to all the existing great reviews. I find this excellent productto be complementary to Yerba Mate as well. I combine the two mates bymaking strong yerba mate sun tea and then steeping the coca tea bags in the first sun tea ( once again in the sun ) making Cocayerb Mate. For my tastes the two work well in concert, I find that the properties of both mates combine nicely.I add a small amount of sugar to my cocayerb mate because I drink it as a dark tea. Cocayerb might be a little intense for those people that don't like coffee due to it's stimulating effects. The speed and efficiency of the Amazon ordering and delivery process is very commendable as well."
1,Import Quality?,"I was in Peru some years ago, and brought back 2 boxes of Coca tea. It was packaged like 100 count boxes of Lipton, (as is the Windsor). It was much stronger than the teas I have bought on Amazon, and I wonder if the Import Quality print on the box designates a weaker strength than what is available in country."
3,It's OK,"I tried this product for a medical condition - symptomatic arachnoid cyst which was caused by a head injury. Tried to use this to relieve brain compression/swelling due to the cyst to try to lower my blood pressure. I think it was OK but the stimulant aspect gave me a headache. I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine, sugar, salt, and chemical meds, so I'm not too surprised my reaction to this. I just don't think I can continue to use it though. Expensive for not being able to finish it."
3,A refreshing exposition of British/Indian history,"I picked this book up in Bangalore, and glanced through the first few pages wondering if it had anything to say to an Austalian/Englishman of today. I quickly found myself engrossed, learning much I had no idea about, of the influence of one country on another put in terms of the religious values of both countries. My wif'e family went to India about the same times as Grant, and must have witnessed the same indifference to famine and drought. The responce by Grant was far reaching, and for better or worse the author looks as how far Indai today has moved towards a society where everyone is equally cared for. We worth reading more than once."
2,Very disappointed with state of product,"Extremely disappointed with how the product arrived. The sharpener seems to work fine, but it arrived with scratches and scrapes all along the sides and top. I certainly wouldn't recommend this seller."
2,there are chepper products out there then this.,"there are chepper products out there that will do the same thing. i personally perfer a wet stone over these sharpeners. dose it work? yes, but not worth $70. for one you can get a good diamond steel for $30 and a sharpener of this style for less then $70; though i wsould recommend a wet stone and you learn how to sharpen it that way and a diamond steel is always good to have on hand for those quick edges."
2,Rushing Rapids,"I'm part way into this book, I have about 200 pages left, and I'm already confused. For instance how is everyone in the little unheard of community of Ravenkill right up with the happenings in The Hague? Does world wide news reach little burgs that fast. And what was with Andrew Franconia the innkeeper that he calls the US Marshalls as soon as Maggie registers? I don't get it, everyone seems to know what everyone else is doing faster than they can move about. So I guess I'll have to finish the story to find all the answers if they are revealed."
5,The Rapids,"Great book and great writer! Love to read all her books. They arehard to put down and hate for the book to end. This book ties in withother characters in her other books, like a serial, which is neat so you get to know all the characters. This book has Maggie and Rob trying to prove that Nicholas Janssen is an international killer and fall in love along the way. The suspense holds your attention right up to the very end."
3,The Rapids flowed rapidly!!!!,"Pleasant book. Good fast pace. Spy stuff and fairly exciting. Hero and Heroine nice enough people but the romance was lackluster. No passion!The hit lady was interesting but you wondered her other torments at being raised by an alcoholic father. Ultimately, she was a killer for the money. Venues were interesting and familiar since I was in Holland last May. I liked that I recognized places.The Rapids was a good afternoon's read. A first for me from Carla Neggers."
2,The Rapids,I love her as an author and I read all of her books but this book was a disappointment. I love how it tied into and brings the characters of her other books but it took eveything I had for me to finish reading this book. She still remains one of my favorite authors and I will look forward to her next book.
5,Excellent thoughts,"I am very taken with Thich Nhat Hanh, and will read anything he has written at least once. Some of his earlier works are a bit too academic for me, but the rest of his work talks directly to me, and has been very helpful in changing course in my life."
5,wonderful product,"I found Peachtree Complete 2004 to be an excellent product for my small business. The set up program made it very easy to get started and with all the sample information already in the product, it was very easy to copy the information to set up my own books. The fact that it automatically converted my information from QuickBooks made it even easier. The support plan seems a little pricey, but well worth it. The support technicians were eager to help and answered all my questions. I would highly recommend this product."
1,Switch and Bait,"I don't know who wrote the reviews which rated this product above 1 star but they must work for Peachtree. An accounting system that does not even let you change the due date on a customer invoice after it is entered is no accounting system. Peachtree's answer to this and other short comings is, ""You should buy our top of the line system.""I urge anyone considering this system to purchase to reconsider."
3,"Fast paced with great fights and magic, but disgusting!","Zorachus is an interesting read. It follows Mancadam Zorachus from his beginning as a holy monk to his fall. The book is largely about his experiences in Khymir, a sort of Sodom or Gomorrah. The descriptions of the city and its customs are truly vile. The book is a good read if you're not put off by violence and graphic sexual content."
3,"Not Bad, but could be better...","This story is an enjoyable swords and sorcery tale, but there are some issues. The book is rife with editing glitches (many proper names uncapitalized at random, two words smashed together due to lack of an appropriate space placement, first person personal pronouns written as ""i"", etc.) If you have a pet peeve about these things, they will most definitely interfere with your enjoyment of the story. The book also lacks exposition about how magic works in this world. The author uses terminology without defining any of it, and assumes the reader already knows."
5,Zorachus!,This is probably one of my all time favorite books and i have read maybe well over a thousand books in my life. I liked Zorachus more than any Philip K. Dick or Clive Barker story and that is saying a hell of a lot. i personally like being sucked into whole other worlds and in Zorachus you are right there seeing the most vivid and dark and twisted things you have ever read.it's like reading a Giger painting or reading some breathtakingly dark painting. There is no way to really describe this book other than it is a visual experience as well as an incredible and fantastic warrior/magician story that i dont want to give any details about. The ending leaves you reeling and leaves all kinds of existenstial questions kicking around in your head loudly for weeks.
1,acute care of the abdomen,Poorly written book obviously written by a non-surgeon. As a practicing general surgeon for the past 30 years this book has little to offer anyone interested in anything but the most rudimentary aspects of abdominal disorders. Don't waste your money!!
4,Great,Another great product from Wusthof! It hold my Wusthof knives nicely. My knives stay in place and do not budge.
4,"Easy to Install, Looks Great","I did a lot of research on knife magnets and this one seemed to get the highest user reviews overall. I can't say anything negative about it. It looks great, keeps my tiny kitchen counter less cluttered and hasn't ruined any of my knives (many magnets are rumored to be 'too strong' and users complain that they bend and break knives)."
2,most uncomfortable shoes ever,"This shoe looks great but is extremely uncomfortable. The first time I wore them I had blisters on my heels that almost cut into the bone revealing the pinkest of flesh. The insides are lined with leather everywhere except the most important place, the heel. Also the toe box is extremely uncomfortable and does not conform to the shape of your foot. I've been wearing them for about two months now and have blisters on 4 different toes, and I have to put bandages on my heels and toes every morning before I leave the house. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more money for a comfortable shoe."
4,Men's Andover Cap Toe Oxford,The shoes fit good. I ordered 1/2 size larger and he needs to break them in. Nice looking shoes and I would recommend them to anyone. He has wore them 3 times and he says they feel better.
1,Awful,"Bought 4 of them to display a simple poster board, after a few uses all the clips that snap into place to hold the poster boards up broke. every single one of them, this is the worse Easel out there. I cant find any replacement parts either."
1,Breaks very easy,"We purchased 5 of these easels. Two already snapped - the bungee rope that holds it together popped off the end. It's not abuse, we only used them about 5 times. Hope the last three fare better. Perhaps they might if we never collapse them."
3,Good for the price,"Easy to assemble and disassemble. Stores nicely in long rectangular boxes. I like the adjustable plastic display holders. Heavy-Duty does not accurately describe this product. The elastic cords holding the metal pieces together break easily. I ordered 8 and one broke within the first week. The price is good for the product, just don't be too rough on them, i.e. drop them on the ground/toss them around."
1,Terrible.,"I buy tons of stuff on amazon. This this is terrible. Pinched my fingers getting the holders open, and the thing's only link point is way at the top so it wobbles around like a chandelier. DO NOT BUY."
3,It worked...kind of,"I bought this for a class that I was teaching over the summer. I just needed something that worked, and could support a moderate sized whiteboard. Throughout the course of the class, I became increasingly frustrated with this product. Yes, it worked...but only for maybe an hour or two at a time. But after a while of use, the legs would slide, sometimes causing the entire structure to collapse. Overall, I am still satisfied with my purchase because it was the cheapest I could find...but if I wanted something more long term, I would opt to get something a bit more expensive."
1,Shock cords will be cut by the poles - design defect.,"The leg poles are held together by shock cord. If you store the product collapsed the tension will cut the cord across the metal ends of the poles. I have used my 3 easels twice and the shock cord is frayed at the joints and has already been cut through on one stand's back leg. I expect all 3 to fail in this same way.Bought these to hold white boards at a 500 person event. Stability is OK, but requires careful setup."
4,Solid tripod stand but beware it does not lock in to place!,"This tripod stand has metal poles that fit inside each other like older style metal tent poles. There are little plastic clips that fold down to a somewhat horizontal position to create the ledge for your board to sit on. These lock in to place when flipped down but they can move down if too much weight is placed on them. Also, the legs do not lock in to place so if the legs are bumped then the whole stand can collapse. I use this with a whiteboard and put a small piece of adhesive Velcro between the board and the very top of the stand. This keeps the board from sliding around on the stand. This would be best if used only has a presentation stand. If I could I would have bought a more sturdy stand for my whiteboard. However, it does a decent job as a static tripod stand."
5,AFFORDABLE AND DURABLE,STURDY AND SO EASY TO SET UP. PERFECT SIZE AND IT WAS MAILED AT THE SPEED OF LIGHTNING. THANK YOU AND SHOP HERE FOLKS!!
4,It will do.,I'm using it for holding up a whiteboard. It's fine. I wouldn't call it heavy duty but it will work.
1,Come on WB,"Young Justice WB has to be the most money hungry company out there they sell partial series then come out with full series and their prices are outragous this is the main reason I wanted to be removed from the web site, they just do not get it, economy is tough money is tight and they just seem to not care."
1,Wait for the entire season.......,"I would rate the series Young Justice 4 stars, but like Batman: TAS, Superman, and Justice League the decision to first release volumes of seasons is just a money grab. Wait a year or two and get entire season for about the same price. Or if you wait 3-5, wait until the series is completed and get the complete series on Blu-Ray and get more extras for a cheaper per season cost than buying each release every year.If you can't wait buy now, but beware this will eventually be either part of a complete series set or a complete season set for a cheaper per disc cost."
2,Now they're just messing with us.,"When this show started, I was really excited, and I'd be inclined to buy this, if it didn't disappear after 9 episodes, 4 months ago. Now they think they can market ""part 1"" of a season that was aborted right after the introductions? To much longer and we'll just forget this show and move on to other shows that actually broadcast new episodes (pretty much every other current show). This dvd is a sad way to keep this show fresh in our minds"
1,Incomplete Season,"I refuse to buy this because it is ""not"" a complete season. The WB should be ashamed of themselves for half assing the fans like this!!!!"
2,YOU guys don't get it,"Of course they put them out in piece like this...they make more money this way. Most fans buy them piecemeal, and then in whole sets. And mostly, this release schedule is to catch parents in stores like Target and Best Buy, not for collectors. When little Johnny wants to put a cartoon in the cart, mom is much more likely to pay 10 bucks rather than 30. Once they feel they've tapped that market, THEN they put out the full set, sometimes on Bluray, so they can get YOUR money. These guys are marketing geniuses with JOBS for a reason. They know how to exploit you and I to make money."
3,"They still don't ""get it""","I have been watching this as it's been coming out and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the storys were. The personalities are an interesting mix and ""real"" problems are being addressed in a measured and responsible manner.So on the whole I'd call ""Young Justice"" a reasonably good follow-on to the recent line of successful WB/DC Animated Series (Batman, Superman, Justice League, etc) the problem is that this is ""V. 1""They tried this with the Justice League and it didn't work.Guys, guys, GUYS! FULL SEASONS! A reasonable price point (say $30.00) and the ENTIRE SEASON in one set.This is not hard to understand, so why don't you?"
1,Young Rip off is more like it.,"I pre ordered this dvd, I am a huge fan of the TV show ""Young Justice"". I am not a fan of being gouged by Warner Brothers.a measly 4 episodes? Had I known that I would have not ordered. Please avoid, they will release these either in a box set or the price will drop, save your money.Instead buy the ""Justice League"" full seasons."
1,No full season. Me no buy-ee.,"Also had to drop the one star ka-boom for no complete first season. Quit trying to squeeze every last possible penny out of the people who actually keep your stuff on the air DC/WB. This is pretty ridiculous.Not as bad as Marvel not making the 4th season of Xmen Evolution available for purchase, but still pretty crappy.[...]"
1,"Decent show, but why no full season?","Please do not buy this DVD! I hate the way producion/marketing executives try to milk consumers for every cent by putting out several editions/partial collections of a ""season"" and then releasing the complete season a year later. Don't encourage this kind of marketing! Consumers don't want to pay [what usually amounts to] double price for something, but that is just what happens when people buy these seasons, broken up into several, single-disc releases. We want complete season releases! Night-time drama shows are not broken down into several separate releases. Why do this with shows for children? Do they think we're stupid? Don't prove them right by buying this SINGLE DVD!Yes, this show is pretty good. It is well-written, has good animation, and the voice acting is also well-done. Still, when it's offered in such a small dose for such a high price, the whole thing just stinks. Get it right WB!"
2,Terrible release for a decent show,"Let me start by saying Warner Bros. is downright evil for releasing this set. Only 9-10 episodes of this series exist so there is no excuse for them not to release at least 9 on this set. I wish the WB would stop ripping us off, but they've been pulling this crap for years, and I don't see them stopping anytime soon.Personally, I don't like this series. The ""teenager"" portion of the show overwhelms the note worthy action, and completely strangles what little plot development this series has. That is my personal opinion though. I want to like it, but there isn't enought here. There are too many amazing DC shows out there for me to recommend this series, and those shows have much more substantial dvd release for me to recommend this set.If you have to have teenage angst doused all over your super heroes, than this is your show. Everyone else should pick up Justice League, or Batman the brave and the bold."
5,Great,"This is a book for those interested in the practical philosophy of landscape architecture. It is not only the discussion by the author, but also the author's illustrations which reinforce her extremely valuable insights into form and complexity. I use the book as an exercise for sketching. She is right, sketching is perception. I highly recommend this book"
5,A True Story - It will capture your heart!,Jeanne Duncan has given us a great story about a young man who becomes a fisherman - but that is just the begining. The terrors and good times of his life at sea comes through in this charming at times true life tale.The author's narrative style draws us a very visual image of the life for these fisherman. It is well written and makes for an easy and entertaining reading experiecne. You will come away with a real appreciation for the life styles of those who go off to sea to earn their living.
1,Customer Service Virtually Non Existant,"Stay away, if you ever need customer service help, it's non existant."
2,"Amazing sound quality,but....","Pros : Amazing sound qualityCons:Battery life is REALLY bad.I use Ni-MH batteries and it comes nowhere near the claimed 20 hrs !Slight learning curve to figure out the *hidden* player features.Others: My unit went kaput once or twice and I had no clue what was going on,and this was on a full battery charge. The unit started functioning again on replacing the battery.I've ordered the samsung YP-MT6Z and the Sony NW-E507 in the quest to find the bestEST flash player out there.."
2,Umbelievely Remarkable!!,"I just got this today and it is the mp3 audiophiles best friend. I'll make it short. Drag and drop files without the software, and comes with a mini-USB adaptor. This is the best sound system with amazing 3D surround sound, mach3bass, and BBE all in one. Beats ipod nano by sound quality. I had this but just found out that its a fashion trend with limited features and battery life. 90db (nano) vs. 95db for I5. Comes with really good earphones although I like to use my Stanton DJ2000 studio monitors A+ Besides why get anything bigger than 1GB. A true audiophilist constantly changes the music everyday... Good luck reading on!"
2,Support really bad,"Bought my Iaudio 5 in April, and was basically satisfied. Then weird things started happening. The display went bonkers, and when trying to list albums, would list one album over and over until I backed out and tried again. Then, while attempting to move from MP3 to FM, or vice versa, it would crash and turn off, and you'd have to start over. This happened about 50% of the time. 20 hours of operation on one AAA is hogwash, it lasts about 5. Finally, it died. It won't turn on, and I can't get support department to return email. Tried calling and got the ""Voicemail is not working"" over and over.The IAudio I bought for my wife seems to be working OK, although it too crashes at times for no reason.I do NOT recommend purchasing one of these unit until there is a proven track record of support and operation."
4,iAudio 5 1 GB Review,"After thorough comparisons among similar products in the same category, Cowon iAudio5 1GB is an excellent product. Sound quality, recording capabilities, (including FM direct recording, Voice recording, Line in Recording), wake up timer, equalizer and sound effects are great. Menus ease of use is an added value. I only have a concern about power consumption, it seems that the recording function drains out the battary very quickly, also, the FM sound, although it is in stereo, is a little bit fair. I only wish that the equalizer settings and the digital sound processing effects can be applied with on FM output. Last wish, to have the 1 GB model in rubby red color. Other than this, the product is an excellent one, and worth having it. Actually, so far, I know 10 persons who purchased the same model and very happy with it."
3,Good player with cheap quality,"Pretty happy with the player overall. Sounds great and is easy to use. The 2 scroll buttons are very cheap quality, though, and frequently tend to stick when pressed and feel very clunky."
2,It's Alright,"This is a good product for someone who just wants to play around with the simple, basic idea of putting rooms together and looking at a house in 3D. Unfortunatly, the work area is small, while the menu on the right takes up almost half of the screen. You can resize the rooms, but that's it. And after awhile, the program itself becomes testy and crashes."
1,don't buy!,"this product did not work!I tried it on my computer and it did not work. I also tried it on my work computer, and my husband's and still no luck."
2,3D Home Architect,"It looks like a great program . Lots of features, I think it is more for an architect or seasoned computer user. I am not that seasoned, and at an age that new things need to be more ""old lady"" friendly. I would like to have used this program, I spent 3hrs trying to set it up and just got lost in it multi-featured menu."
1,Bad News,"I don't know the quality of this program. It has been well reviewed by others, but one of the CDs I was sent would not install (a CD with the wrong serial number was sent), the CD container did not hold the CD's so they kept falling out, and when I called the ""free"" technical support line for help, well, I was put on hold for ever. I decided to return the software, rather than get a replacement, because I felt that I was unlikely to get help from the manufacturer (Individual Software) with their endless telephone ""hold"" time."
4,Simple and Easy to use...,"I love this program! I have spent hundreds of dollars on other programs and this tops them all for only $20 bucks. The rendering is good, lots of objects to choose from. Excellent tutorial Video/Audio feature. I recommend this to anyone interested in visualizing your new home,addition, or just want to have fun as a hobby designing rooms and homes!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Not a great product in my opinion. I was able to create a basic design easily and quickly (and even add doors and windows), but then could not subsequently delete a wall I no longer wanted. Also, copy-n-paste was not an option where I needed it......making identical copies of certain rooms. I had to recreate each from scratch. Aligning items is a manual operation, although the snap-to-grid feature does at least make the task doable. Starting the program requires having the original CD in the CD drive.....a royal pain. The makers of this program seemed to have concentrated on things I consider fluff.....decorating your virtual home, and paid little attention to things I consider to be very important: allowing the user to create a good floor plan. My recommendation: buy something else."
2,"Good for one room, bad for entire house","I designed my new kitchen using this software. While the ""one room"" design worked rather well, I am yet able to complete an entire house layout. The program has several flaws, almost all involving its ability to ""share"" walls (i.e. living room's south wall is dining room's north wall). Like another reviewer mentioned, the wall problems cause vague error messages to pop-up that do not specifically tell you the exact location of the problem. At this point, you must exit without saving or your whole design will become corrupted.This is a fun program if you like decorating, or if you don't mind building each room in your home as an individual design. However, if you're looking for a program strong enough to do extensive remodeling or new home construction, you're better off looking elsewhere."
1,Not Quick or Easy,"Truly, this is not quick or easy, mainly frustrating. Unless you're doing a VERY basic square room, forget it. Agree with the reviewer who said that error messages are frequent and inexplicable, and that work can disappear at any time. I'll add to that list that the software also freezes frequently, so save often. I fiddled with it for 2 hours in attempts to lay out our finished basement, which is one large U-shaped room with a smaller laundry room and stairs in the middle. Software froze twice, lost my edits several times, measurements inexplicably disappeared, and I finally resorted to good ol' pen and paper. I think this is a case where if you want software to do what you need it to do, you have to spend the big(ger) bucks."
3,Great start but lacks depth,This study guide is a great start to the book of Philippians but lacks depth. Most of the sections have a short dialogue followed by a list of questions. While the questions are good at starting a conversation there is not much interpretation or background info. I would have liked a little more prompting and detail to lay the groundwork for a conversation.
2,"Good concept, bad execution","I have had my trainer for three years and it's great to stay in shape during the winter months when it's to cold outside. But the software is terrible. I have resorted to dedicating a clean install of XP to the trainer. I paid for the upgrade to 3.0 and am sticking to 3.01 which is functional for me but flawed. When I accepted the update to 3.1 it disabled my system and I couldn't use it for a week while I waited for support to send me a new password file. For some reason they have a convoluted registration scheme running on a server. This makes no sense because you need their proprietary hardware to use the software. Check out their forums and you will see how many problems there are with tacx stuff. It's too bad because as far as I can find, no one else is making a unit that does what this promises to do."
1,Junk,"This tool turned out to be totally worthless. Would not lock on the bolts, the ratchet idea is far to course with jaws that long. Wing nut would have been much more useful.I wound up giving up on it, taking the water pump and fan out as a unit, and using a vise to hold the impeller to get the fan off.Don't waste your money on this."
1,DO NOT BUY !,TOTAL TRASH ! I tried to use this for the first time today . the maker of this tool thought it would be 'fancy' to have this ratchet set up to adjust the tool . IT DOES NOT WORK ! you adjust for proper size and when even a little pressure is put on the tool the forks 'stretch' at all the rivit points and it slips off the bolt . does not even work a little bit . if the designers of this tool had just threaded the shaft that holds the spring and added a wing nut to lock the tool to proper size or forget the hooks and just have holes to run the bolts through i know it would be a great tool . but its not its just great on paper . garbage to me
5,Good Deal For First CD Burner,"I just received this and it was up and running in 30 minutes. I have a Dell and it had all of the needed cables ready to go. This is the first time I have attempted to install any hardware myself. I did it in less than 30 minutes and all works great. I burned my first CD and was playing it in 10 minutes after installing the software. Trust me, I am no computer geek and this was a breeze. I just hope it last as long as it was easy to install and use. So far, I'm impressed with both the burner and I have to admit Dell made it easy too!!! Everything was right there waiting for me to just plug it in."
1,Product doesn't work - no tech support.,The machine will copy to CD-R but not to CD-RW - no matter what the box says.No tech support - no matter what the web site says. No one answers the toll-free tech support # and there is no response to tech support questions asked via email.So don't buy the product if you need any support.I'm returning mine.
4,Nice burner but watch for problems...,"I bought this burner based on price and the posted reviews. I am very happy with it, but for those of us that have never seen the inside of a computer, I think the manual could have been a little more involved. But, don't worry, if I figured it out, you will. I did have a problem with the software that came with it. It wouldn't work with my burner. I contacted tech support and they had me upgrade from their website and then everything was fine. So, it's a great deal, easy to use, you just may have some easily fixed snags along the way."
4,Cingular T-Mobile Blackberry 8100 Pearl Battery + Car + Travel Charger,Car and travel charger are excellent. Battery is not from the original manufacturer but it works great. overall a good buy for the price.
1,"Confusing, hard to use, full of errors","This book is a terrible book. I found the book extremely frustrating to read and troublesome to use. When I first learned about signals and systems and used this book as a learning guide, I had a terrible time trying to understand the book. Some of the exercises even disagree with the books definition, and after taking an advanced systems and signals courses, I realized that the book is full of errors. For example, its definition of a memoryless system is completely wrong.I've also tutored students who are using this book at UC Berkeley as the main class textbook. They have a difficult time understanding the book as well. If you want a good introduction to Signals and Systems, get ""Signals and Systems"" by Haykin and Van Veen instead of this book. That book does a much better job covering the topic and goes more in depth to cover advanced topics such as wavelets and z-transforms."
2,bad bad bad,"When reading this book I felt a strange suspicion that the authors intent was to confuse the student by withholding greatly needed details needed to explain this topic. This book is written in such a convoluted way that seems to be more aimed at readers who buy ""Be and Expert in 24 Hours!"" books.Even more, I had to use this book while taking the corresponding class taught by one of the authors. I does not help the student a bit to read the book, be confused and then go to lecture only to have the professor/author regurgitate the same material with same examples!This is the first time I've ever written an online review, I felt compelled to steer people away from this book!"
2,Difficult Book to Understand,"I had the luxury of taking this course when it was taught by one of the authors, and I still found the book extremely difficult. Some of the concepts of the book are certainly captivating as it teaches you stuff ranging from sound manipulation to how graphics programs manipulate images, but the material is condensed and extremely hard to pick up. There were moments where I had to re-read chapters three or four times just to get a basic understanding of what is going on. Many of the sections simply throw mathematical equations at you and skip a lot of the fundamental steps when deriving theorems or making connections. I ended up finishing the course with only a superficial understanding of the material because some of the content was extremely hard to understand. If you buy this book, be prepared to spend a good amount of time re-reading a lot of the chapters. IMHO, this is not the ideal book for an introductory Signals course - it is far too complex."
1,Very poor...well everything,"This book is beyond bad. The notation is by far the worst. I have never seen such a messy way of describing domains and ranges or signals as what is used in this book. It honestly doesn't even make sense to me or anyone else I know that's seen this book.The examples are impossible to follow due to the notation that is used and it simply adds more frustration to anyone trying to learn signals and systems. I guess you can tell my main problem is with this ridiculous notation but the book also just fails to be a learning tool. Most of the time you spend trying to figure out what the author was trying to say rather than learning about signals and systems.If you're a student and this book is required for your class, try to do without it and find something else, because this book sure won't help."
5,Solid,"First, the unit had a reassuring weight to it. That says little about quality, but I was comforted.The unit is highly accurate, certainly within .1 volts. It was nice to find my DVM and the power supply in such good agreement.There was some slight ripple, ranging from 20 mV to around 160 mV, depending on the selected voltage. At most this was around 0.8%, nothing to get too worked up over.The selected voltage remained stable. By this I mean that once I selected a voltage, it stayed there. It didn't drift as the unit warmed up, didn't change when I turned the thing off and then on again.There were no frills to this unit. It gives you well-regulated and accurate power. If that's all you need, then this is a great little power supply."
3,Good for the money,"My only complaint is the LCD isn't back lit, so low light it is difficult to check the voltage. Also it would be nice to have the knobs click when turning so they would be a little more resistant to accidental over voltages."
3,Bench power supply,The unit is nice easy to use and basically a cheap bench supply. I have not had a chance to check the regulation with a scope but I am not getting any noise on the audio circuit I have connected now.
1,Didn't Do What Was Expected,"Got this unit to use for LED constant current testing. Needed to set the current to .35A (350mA) and 3.5 Volts. Nope! Won't do it. Tried everything in the instruction manual. I must be missing something, but this power supply should allow you to set the current and voltage nearly independently. No luck. Forced to return."
1,Not so SAFE !!!,"I did NOT expect the negative terminal to have a constant voltage with respect to ground. My project can be repaired, but what a pain. One reviewer noted that the case screws were also 'HOT' - Yikes! - Another safety surprise.It also has an annoying relay that kicks in around 9 vdc. It cause a jump in the output voltage. I suspect the two ranges that are being switched in and out, do not dove-tail with each other as they should. This is very annoying when you are slowly increasing the voltage.If you decide to buy this anyway (it is a good price and the meters are accurate) be very, very careful!I figured this out too late, now I'm stuck with it. I can't think of anything to do with it that ISN'T a safety risk. A doorstop maybe ..."
1,Bad Power supply. don't buy,"I should have checked this power supply when I received it. I only got a chance to use it a few weeks ago. Upon plugging the power supply, I heard a sound indicating a failed fuse. I changed the fuse and started it again. Next was a flash of smoke. The large caps had blown. I now have a big brick item."
4,Great bang for the buck.,"Not many bells and whistles, but a good common use bench supply. Adjustment knobs take a little getting used to-- would be nice if they had detents or were less sensitive. However, the flip side is that it is very convenient to quickly change between voltages, say 5V and 12V. It takes me MUCH longer to do so with many other push button set supplies I use.This is not a high grade supply you'd want to use in applications where fractions of a volt or amp can let the magic smoke out of components. However, it is great for driving many sorts of electronics with regulators or at least some form of voltage/current protection in a given circuit.Great for LEDs, motors, actuators, audio devices, etc. Not so great for precision electronics or directly powering components.Bottom line, got what I paid for; and for less than the cost of a single high end supply, I have two knockaround units to complement my bench when I need an extra 5V somewhere in a hurry."
5,One of the loveliest films that I know!,I saw this early masterpiece of Ingmar Bergman 20 years ago once and could never forget it. I am so happy to have found it again!
3,"INGMAR BERGMAN, OPUS 11","*** 1952. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The wives of four brothers are waiting for them in a summer cottage. They speak about their respective marriage and explain why they've stayed with their husband in spite of the loss of their romantic ideals. In my opinion, the film suffers from the gap between dialogues very well written and a cinematic form which was then not totally domesticated by Ingmar Bergman. But I can be wrong in this matter and I was maybe not in the mood for a Bergman movie last night. I'll give SECRETS OF WOMEN another chance one of these nights. You can find at Amazon.co.uk a zone 2 DVD release of this motion picture coming from Tartan video."
2,Not as it appears in pictures,"This is a magnificent concept, but I returned for one reason:In pictures it appears that the vessel has a soft, even illumination, but in person the light source is clearly visible and not near diffuse enough. The function is fine and the quality seems fine as well, but the light is a disappointment."
5,More Than Just Dolls,"MAKING CREATIVE CLOTH DOLLS is colorful, specific, inspiring...and rich in unexpected information. Throughout the book, sidebar stories will amaze the readers: stories of spirit dolls, religious dolls, mysteries and myths. This is a wonderful reference book as well as a great How-To manual!"
2,Not a masterpiece,"Also this book is a classic in hearing research it is not a very understandable one. The author deals much to far with basic hearing things and cochlear processing, extends content to the maximum, that's not what I expected and to make the picture perfect the language is more difficult then easy. I don't like it, maybe your money is better invested in the Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing."
3,Don't freak out about the bug,The bug will be corrected in the reprint of the game coming out in a few weeks. Codemasters will provide info on how to get a free replacement of the cart. The entire NA print run has the glitch in it.
1,"DO NOT BUY, NOT PLAYABLE PAST LEVEL 30.","ok, we ALL love classic Bubble Bobble. The classic game is here in all its glory. The ""new"" version... is terrible. One stage spans 4 screens so there is alot of not see whats going on. whats more the characters are bigger and so are the pixels. indeed the ""new"" version, actually looks worse in spite of the brighter colors.The new version also has a MAJOR BUG THAT MAKES THE GAME UNPLAYABLE past level 30. There a boss is supposed to appear, which never does and as you can move on other levels before beating the boss you are stuck. which is just as well because you wont want to play the ""new"" version for more than 2 seconds anyway.For this reason the game gets one star.Now if you are interested in Bubble Bobble on a portable, get Bubble Bobble Old and New for the GBA. This 2002 version of the game is not only graphically more impressive, the ""New"" version in that title is an amazing joy to play and offers many features (like a museum) that are absent here."
5,bobble bubble revolution,"the game is great,i use to play this game when i was a kid.this game never gets old or boring.this game gets 5 stars.i reccomened this game to other people."
3,Not exactly what it used to be ...,I just purchased Bubble Bobble Revolution and only purchased it to play the classic version which was well remade but the new version of Bubble Bobble totally blows. The designing of the case is terrible. Bubble Bobble don't look like fat dinosaurs that look like they swallowed a balloon. They were cute characters and the rest of the game is kinda cheezy and cheaply made. This is what happens when they recreate a game they personally aren't exactly interested in. So you get cheap work but if it's something they're interested in like say Final Fantasy they'll go to every detail to make it GREAT !! I'd say wait til the price goes down or there's a sale of some sort. Not worth $30 bucks if you ask me. And the glitch problem seems to have been fixed cuz I just got mine and I can go past lvl 30.
5,Informative and well-written,"I have long wanted to read a general history of Austrailia, and when I read. on April 3, 1988, The Fatal Shore, by Robert Hughes, I said to myself, in my post-reading note: ""I am glad I read this book, but maybe I'd've done better to read a plain history of Australia than this long account of this aspect of its beginning."" I am shamed to say that it has taken over 12 years to do what I thought I should have done back then. This book goes up to 1999, and portrays very well the current dilemmas facing Australia. If you enjoy the articles in Current History, as I do, this book reminds me of those articles, except it is less bland and neutral. Ordinarily I avoid histories with designations such as ""short"" or ""concise"" figuring that I want a fuller treatment. But when one knows as little of a country as I do of Australia, I thought this a good introduction to its history."
2,Interesting subject matter buried under impenetrable language...,"One has the sense, when slogging through this book, that there is interesting material here. The inclusion of information about the aboriginals who inhabited Australia before 1778 is laudable. However, as has been noted previously, the language is just too difficult to read. The sentence structure is so complicated, and the vocabulary so obscure, that it feels as if it were written 100 years ago, when the English language was in a different stage of evolution.I was actually unable to finish the book. At a certain point Macintyre begins to discuss at length the activities of ""the Chartists."" However, he makes no attempt to establish who the Chartists were, what they stood for, or why they were called the Chartists. That was it for me.... I cut my losses and put it down.I am just beginning Robert Hughes' ""The Fatal Shore,"" and so far it is infinitely more engaging."
1,concise history of australia,"According to the author, Australian history is 200 years of racism, sexism, oppression, dominance, exploitation. The victims are aborginal people, women, the early convicts -- and the environment. The villains, of course, are white males. When the Australian economy dips, the fault lies with the U.S., world capitalism and neoliberalism. When the Australian economy thrives, it just means Aussies can waste more money on bourgeois geegaws. The tone is humorless, unrelenting, shrill, one-sided -- a prime example of what one Australian referred to as ""black armband history""."
4,Great to go back in time...,"I loved this movie when I saw it at 17 years old having just been dumped and cheated on by my boyfriend! As a child of the 60's and 70's and a bit of a hippie at heart, this movie just made me feel good! Maybe not quite as good as I remember, but fun to go back to. Glad I bought it since I don't think it's ever been shown (or ever will be) on TV."
3,Character study of a weak man,"This movie is about a man (George Segal) who loses his marriage because he brought his secretary home and had sex with her there. He didn't think he was doing anything really wrong by cheating on his wife and he felt entitled to because cheating is a commonplace activity and ""everybody does it"". He didn't think his wife would know and he seems genuinely puzzled that she minds when she catches him. The question the film left me with was, has he become any less selfish by the end of the movie? He decides he wants his wife back, and he gets her, as he easily gets most everything he wants -- but I wondered if he wouldn't do the same thing again if temptation crossed his path another time. And I wondered also why his wife would go back to such a proven loser. It's an uncomfortable movie, but it's worth seeing if one keeps in mind that these are not heroic people and not meant to be seen that way."
1,send it back,"I LOVE JANE.FIRST HEARD ON LATE NIGHT RADIO.I BOUGHT EVERY LP THEN CDS,SINCE 72.KRAUTROCK DVD,PANKA TRIBUTE.ALSO SWISS VIDEO FROM YOU TUBE.THIS CD SUCKS BECAUSE CRAPPY VOCALIST RUIN BAND.THIS CD WAS ONLY ONE THIS PARTICULER VOCALIST WAS ON.ALL OF THE REST ARE TOTALLY COOL AND COLLECTED........................................"
5,Perfect Knife Storage,"I never liked the wood block knife holders. Seems like they were designed to tip over and besides they take up counter space. Wüsthof is a very reputable brand and this knife magnet bar lives up to the reputation. Easy to install, keeps your knives nice & handy, well made. The only complaint came from my wife, ""It's looks cluttered to have the knives out like that"". I disagree, better than the wood block to me. Hope this helps."
2,poorly engineered,"German engineering has a good reputation and Wusthof knives are quality, so why is this knife holder so poorly designed? The method of installation, the instructions for installation, and the crappy standard screws, mean this bar is difficult to mount on the wall, and quick to fall off. The plastic mounting brackets strip easily. The magnets are strong, so the bar tears off the wall easily when removing a knife."
1,Damages your knives,"I did not even get to the installation... just having the knives on the magnet and trying to find a location in the kitchen for it, caused damage to our super expensive, brand new knives. The instructions have no warnings on how one needs to treat these.The screws are way too small for the weight that the 20 inch holder will have to bear. They are not suitable for installation on sheet rock as it will not last.We also tried to install the magnet vertically. That doesn't work either because the weight of the handles makes the knives swing in their place. So it won't look nice. I am returning mine."
1,Forget It!,Impossible to install as instructed- to get it mounted you need to modify mounting instructions. Not worth the trouble. The plastic brackets should be metal. Poorly engineered device.
1,mis-translated!,"I got this book hoping I could learn the language before I went on my vacation to Casablanca. What I did find out later (I wouldnt have known unless someone told me) was that some words were not ranslated properly! One of the transliterations of a word gave the Arabic word: ""tarjim"" which means ""translate"" in Arabic! Big mistake! Also, some words in the translation for a phrase were missing. I wouldnt recommend it, unless you are desperate. Plus, a lot of the books pages (which aren't many, it's a very thin book)were taken up with how to count to ten in Berber, Berber phrases, and some French phrases. If I wanted a tiny French phrasebook I would have bought one. This book is really small and a lot of it is wasted with the French and Berber stuff, and too many incorrect (moroccan)Arabic transliterations."
5,"Dazzling version, well-served by Blu-Ray","I had almost worn out my old VHS version of this remarkable production.When I saw it was newly available on Blu-Ray, I couldn't wait to buy it.Julia Migenes-Johnson is riveting, and the fact that this was filmed in Ronda and Seville brings the story back to settings originally conceived by Mérimée. The new subtitles are much more reliable than the older ones.And the Blu-Ray process makes it possible to experience much more detail.I will treasure this disc until it wears out!"
2,"Yes, Olive actually kills Carmen, right at the beginning","I wish I had read the comments of the previous reviewer before buying this thing. Being a francophone, I don't need English subtitles when I listen to Carmen. It was so irritated to see the ugly yellow subtitles over this beautiful film that I had to stop watching it after 15 minutes.My suggestion to Olive Films: make an effort and offer the translation in more than one language as most major labels do; but most of all, allow the viewer to remove the subtitles.Now this Blu-ray disc will make a perfect coaster for my coffee table."
5,Carmen,This version of Carmen with Placido Domingo is WONDERFUL! The scenery and the singing are both outstanding! You will enjoy it.
1,carmen dvd,i am very dissapointed this dvd will not play on uk players when ibought this dvd it didnot mention it was for U.S.A. dvd players .when i ask you for help i am told it will cost me 28 which i find unbelivable.
2,"I took CCNA courses, and no, this book falls way short","This book simply didn't contain the information needed to configure a cisco anything. I would not recommend this to anyone. If you really want to know how to configure and troubleshoot cisco, take the CISCO courses, it might take a year or two, but you'll get more out of it than this book."
1,Bad,"the quality isnt what I expected from revelon, but that might be from the shipping. Arrived on time, but the lipstick was all melted and left a big mess in the cover, so it was irritating and messy when I opened it."
5,Great Color,This color has been discontinued by Revlon. I have worn Chinaglaze Red for years and love it. I was delighted to find it on Amazon and purchased four tubes. That should last me quite some time.
3,Just okay..,"I have worn Revelon lipstick for many many years - I just love it, but they discontinued my favorite color and I thought I would order several on line so I would have it for awhile. I ordered it, got it on time, in great shape, but I think the lipstick is old because it doesn't wear well like the ones I use to buy in this same brand and color. Nothing against the shipping and arrival, but just something I sense in using it."
4,"Some songs not really ""essential""!!","The songs ""Late for Your Life,"" ""10,000 Miles,"" and ""The Long Way Home"" are,in my opinion, in no way ""essential Mary Chapin Carpenter"" but, rather, a waste of time on this otherwise very satisfying CD.Instead of them I would have included ""Come On, Come On,"" ""The Dreaming Road,"" and other similarly moving MC Carpenter classics which were left out. However, it's great to have ""Halley Came to Jackson,"" ""I Am A Town,"" ""Only A Dream,"" ""He Thinks He'll Keep Her,"" ""I Feel Lucky,"" ""Stones in the Road,"" and ""The Hard Way"" all on one album. I've never been wild about ""Shut Up and Kiss Me"" but many of MCC's fans are, and that's on here too. Overall a good listening experience."
4,Almost perfect,I would have omitted Late For Your Life for my fav Come On Come On.Other than that this is good if you don't have MCC Cds. I have them all so I wouldn't need this!
5,The Essential Mary Chapin Carptenter,This is a awesome collection of Mary Chapin Carptenter's best work. I would recomend this to anyone who likes her music.
2,Lots of filler.,"I guess I bought this CD for a few big time favorite songs. There's so much filler on this CD I can't even listen to it all the way through. I should have gone with a shorter best-of CD. Unless you're a big fan, this is gonna bore you to tears."
2,"Backgroud ""Hiss"" ruins the experience","I have been shopping for wireless headphones to watch t.v.for awhile and I was very excited to try these out.After connecting them to the Digitical Optical Output on myreceiver I was ready to be blown away! What a dissapointment.During the dialog of a movie there was a constant ""hiss"" in the backgroud and the max. volume is not that high. So, if you want to crank up the volume while watching a music or movie DVD movie you will be disappointed.The one positive is that when watching a movie, if they are not talking and it is an action scene, the sound is very good.But, as soon as they began to speak the ""hiss"" happens again.Do not buy these, buy Sennheisers HD-65. They don't have the constant ""hiss"" and the max. volume is much higher.Trust me, I tried half a dozen wireless models."
1,Save your money. This is pure junk,"I bought this headset with anticipation of high quality surround sound wireless. What I got was PFfffttt every few seconds, and a constant desire to change the position of my head (8 feet from the transmitter). Fortunately after a couple of sad attempts at watching movies with these headphones they simply broke for no reason at all... no stress, no kid playing with them... just cheap plastic cracking like a kids toy from burger world. I tossed them in the trash with disgust. Save your money."
2,Not Ready for Wireless,The Sound quality is reasonably good with great sounding bass. If this was a wired headphone I would give it 4 or maybe 5 stars. This product is not ready for wireless. When it does work it sounds great but you cannot get 1 minute of continuous play without it hissing or cutting out even at 3ft range. Beyond 30 ft its useless. Incidentally people buy this product for its wireless feature which doesn't work and thats why I give it 2 stars. If AR had had stick to wired & sell it at half the price they would make a bundle. It simple means that not enough testing was done before they release it to the public. IF AR CAN SOLVE ITS WIRELESS PROBLEMS THIS WOULD BE A SUPERB PRODUCT.
3,"decent sound, fragile headphone",I have had the headphones for about a month and only used them every few days. The left earpiece broke off as I removed the headphones from my head. The headphones were never dropped or mistreated. The sound was good with occassional snaps and hisses but for a wireless product its hard to expect more sound quality.I am returning the headphones and buying another brand.
3,Buyer Beware of Breakage!,"I got for Christmas, great sound, but they physically broke the second day from normal use. It appears to be a design flaw in the piece that connects the lower section of the headset to the upper, just above the earpiece. If you've had the same problem please let AR know so they will re-design or make a modification to fix the problem. Luckily I was able to return them for a full refund, which is when I was told by a store rep that they have had a lot of returns for the same reason. I also sent an email to AR customer service for them to notify me of any plans for a fix."
3,Lots of static on the AW791's,"Good base, great depth but I returned them because of too much static. No matter if I was 1 foot or 10 feet away from the transmitter, there was always static."
3,Mediocre,Mediocre signal... period.We had much better luck with the Sennhesiers... even the lower-end ones
3,For the price? Not too shabby,"Well, years ago, I saw the Sony surround headphones (MDR-DS*) and thought they would be pretty cool. The price scared me stiff.Now you have these and the Sennheiser RS 65, with similar praise and criticism.For me, the hiss was annoying, but after laying back to watch my movie, I was able to ""retune"" the hiss to a decent level, then the movie drowned out the rest. I'm not sure how much if a surround effect there was (I forgot to test that), but the headphones could play action scenes pretty well.For the prices that they're available for, with included NiMH batteries, it's hard to argue against them.I'm keeping mine, though I'm hoping to compare to the Sennheisers soon.How is it that cordless phones are worry free in 900MHz up to 5+GHz, and we can't get decent headphones?"
3,POOR VOLUME,This item has weaker volume as compared to other wireless headphone units.The other features seemed to work as good as the other units though.
3,The Good And Bad,"1st let me state the good.The sound is great if you stay in one spot. They are very confortable. If your better half gose to bed early and you want to sit and jam, you'll need these.The bad. They wont reach 50 ft. without cutting in and out.Static will come and goe no matter where you are.Over all if you have the bucks to spend the aw791 has great sound close to the transmitter."
2,OK but just OK,"Have owned these for a year now. I would not recommend them. I have these at home for my PC. Everything seems to add interference. Its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones. Some days just turning your head a few inchs when I am a feet from the unit is enough for them to loose signal. I don't bother to charge them on the stand, I rotate batteries between a charger and the headphones. At work I have had 2 pairs of sennheiser headphones. In 2004 I bought the RS-40. They worked great but I broke them by standing on them. Now I have refurbished RS130s that work excellently, and they run in rechargable AAA's! Neither Senn's really have the ""surround sound"" but I can't tell the difference to be honest. The surround sound on these is not that decernable. I think reception quality trumps surround dound in the end. I would get the RS130s"
4,everything's great....except....,"My AR headphones don't seem to have the other problems that i've seen on reviews. the sound is excellent(i've even gone downstairs and then outside and it works perfectly!). I've yet to have a problem with the supplied batteries(and i watch tv/dvds for HOURS).The only problem I really have with them, is that they sometimes irritate my ears, but, it takes a while."
1,The interference is unbearable.,"These headphones (AW791) were a gift and look very nice. The design did not bother me as it did other reviewers. I found the headset quite comfortable. However, the sweaking, hiss, interference, and occasional loss of signal are unbearable. I tend to listen to music at a louder volume, but regardless, the clicks and hiss are present at all volumes. I am not an audiophile. But the sound quality is unacceptable. I am not familiar with any other wireless headphones to make a comparison, but these are terrible. Note: I live in an apartment building. Perhaps it would work better in a single-family household with less 900 MHz interference. BEWARE."
1,Garbage... what a waste,"A total waste of time and money. I think I wasted more time however. I still haven't got them to work and it has been several hours of trying non-stop. I am computer savvy, so I know what to do, but still, NOTHING - no sound, I am not even lucky enough to get this ""infamous"" hissing sound. Screw the product and the company that made it. Don't buy it no matter how cheap it is (I was deceived by price). WATCH OUT FOR THIS TRASH!"
1,Too bad about the interference,"I concur, if you can tilt your head just right, the sound quality is nice (but the whine is still there). But the static and whine are horrible, even 2' away from the base. Returning."
3,Wait for some more time.....,"Guys,Though You can't avoid Hssss sound I think Sound quality is ok. One thing I invented is turning the face of transmitter towards ur left or right reduces a noise little, what a great invention, isn't it?, I think should get a patent on it before anyone does :-)). When you are moving sounds dies. Haven't seen any use or surround sound button yet. Though in headset it says batteris of 1.4 required they supplied me [Amazon -> TigerDirect ] 1.2 volt rechargable batteris whick looked like aged enough to Die.Headset is bit heavy, neck and ear muscles start paining initially. better keep Aspirin ready for few days till you get used to it. I suggest to wait till this techonolgy improves or give a try with headset which is not so bad at all. Quality of materials used won't look good.Good Luck,jay"
4,AW 791,"some of the reviews above are in-accurate.First off: there is no tuning knob on the base so they (other reviews) must be referencing another model. (aw721?)This model has three channel selectorsI got mine off ebay for $50.pro's:-works great, little hiss when its turned on, but this is because it is auto tuning ( 3 seconds)-takes digital inputs (optical too)-volume goes way up.-comparable if not better than my Sony MDR-CD380-freedom from my mp3 player, pc, etc-? interferes with my cell phone's incomming signal. (side-effect, but nice ""Feature"" ;)con's:-feels weak. dont think it will survive a drop or sit-on-the light on the base when charging does not glow. (I dont know if it should, I must call them)-Batteries dont seem to charge. Maybe this problem is limited to my set."
1,Won't stand behind their product,"The headphone swivel is very poorly designed. When you plug them into the base to recharge it puts stress on the swivel. I received a pair as a gift in February 2003 and the swivel broke two months later. I thought it might have been misuse (my grandson had used them once) so I purchased a replacement set. The same thing happened again. I returned them for warranty service and was told by their customer service department that the parent company, Thomson, purchased Acoustic Research in July 2003 and will not honor any warranties on purchases prior to that date. Purchase these at your own risk. Why should you expect them to treat new customers any better?"
1,DON'T waste your $$$$,"I bought these but promptly returned them. They are underpowered, leaving lots of static and squeaks in the radio signal, even from 6 feet away. Also, the signal often drops out for no apparent reason and it may come back in ""locked"" on to your neighbor's headphone signal, a block away.Despite the high list price and fancy branding, these things are total junk. I suggest cheaper infared models if you want to avoid noise. If you need ""through the walls"" wireless, a cheap (...)set should perform better, since they usually do not include the ""auto signal lock"" feature that leads to losing the channel you're listening to. I suggest staying away from Acoustic Research, which is just an expensive brand for the cheap electronics manufacturer, Recoton. That said, Recoton at a low $20 price should be fine."
2,If not for the static...,"If not for the static, I would be very happy with this purchase. Despite the size, they are quite comfortable. Connected to a DVD player by coax digital cable, I found the surround effect with Dolby Digital sources to be surprisingly effective. I have not had the batteries die during normal use (3-4 hours). However, the noise/static is very intrusive, and I cannot find a position that reduces it to a reasonable level, even with the transmitter a mere six feet away. I live in an apartment complex, so the 900MHz band is quite heavy with traffic from phones, computer peripherals, etc.; perhaps a homeowner would have better luck.Positives:-comfort-effective surround effect-battery lifeNegatives:-noise/static even 6 feet away from the transmitter."
1,Do not recommend,"Debated between Sennheiser and Accoustic Research products and chose wrong. One earphone broke off taking it out of the packaging. Apparently the ear pieces are held on by a piece of plastic 1/8 by 1/4 inch thick that snaps of easily. Hissing sound, unless direct line of sight. Later, started hearing ""crackle"" every tens seconds despite trying several configurations. (...)"
5,Very Good And Clear,These headphones are really neat. At first they had a lot of static until I found out that I had to turn my surround sound system to stereo because the audio cables that were plugged in don't support surround and they were trying to send signals to speakers that weren't there. They were then very clear. Every so often you'll come into a little bit of static when listening to CDs while you are moving around but DVDs play crystal clear and the Dolby surround is really neat. I believe that the optical cable that is included really helps with the clarity (and you can only get Dolby with an optical cable or a digital coaxial cable which is not included). All in all I would recommend these to someone who is looking for some wireless headphones.
1,eh,not that great..the wireless reception is substandard and it wont compare to any sennheiser on the market.go try sennheiser
3,The voice of main ingredient,"Great songs sounds to much like the main ingredient but still a good buy. The single mind pleaser was a hit in the early 80,s this is a cd that is very hard to find and looking at the cost here you might want to wait until the price goes down.I think this was his only solo album(cd)he did.Right after this he reformed the main ingredient.This may not be what your are looking for but if you like the rare stuff buy it enjoy!"
3,For fanciers of spiced-up Harlequin paperbacks only,"In calling this ""a classic in the super-heated tradition of Marcus Van Heller"", the editor does Mr. Van Heller an injustice. Although the book has its moments, some 70% of the contents is devoted to long-winded dialogue and descriptions, all with little or no erotic content. If mr. Anonymous had deleted half of the text and spent the room thus created to fully developing the erotica-part, this book would really have been a hot little number."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This was a huge disappointment, and I returned my copy. There are many awesome kosher cookbooks available, most (if not all) heavily discounted at Amazon. Don't waste your money on this garbage! It was printed in small, tight print, like the cheapest community cookbooks, but with a much heftier price tag. And there were *NO* warm comments from the contributors (or anyone else) telling why any of the recipes were worthwhile. With so many excellent kosher cookbooks, don't waste your money on this one!"
2,Not Particularly Funny,"I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews here but was very disappointed. Both the writing and humor fell flat for me. Also, as one other reviewer pointed out, the typographic quality of this edition is horrible."
2,"Very dim display, even on bright setting",Even in a room with most of the lights off and the TV on it's hard to see the clock due. Even visitors with 20/20 vision have commented on it. Dim numbers defeats the purpose of a large display.
5,"Good Clock, Good Value","I was looking for a basic clock that was easy to program and easy to view. The Chaney Instruments clock turned out to be an excellent value. Its programming is very straightforward. Best of all, the two-inch-tall green digits are easy to read from across the room. (You can adjust the brightness, by the way.) Overall, I am very pleased with this clock."
2,Sorely dissappointed,Last LED digit malfuntioned. Clock too bright even on low dimmer. Too much of a hassle to return. It sits in my closet.
1,Quality Suspect,"This clock LOOKS nice. What's not to like about a large, green LED clock?However, when I received mine, one of the seven segment LEDs didn't work. So instead of 9:00PM it says 5:00PM.Great. It will cost me more to ship it back then I paid for it. Guess I'll just go to Target and get one."
2,very dim display,"I know other reviewers found the display too bright. It does have a dimmer switch, but at least on my clock the choices are ""Dim"" and ""Very Dim"". My conclusion is that probably the quality of the LEDs is poor, with a lot of variation from one clock to the next. It's a very cheap piece of equipment, and not worth almost twenty bucks..."
5,Very nice,"Very nice Chaney Instruments Digital Alarm Clock with Green LED , I like it so much, big numbers you can see it very well."
3,Alright for a general clock.,"Dimmer only has two modes, bright, and bright. It isnt an actual dimmer, there is no real noticeable difference in light modes, i promise you that.And thats all, cause what else is there to review in a cheap clock? I kind of wish i'd gotten a red or blue one though, the green on this clock seriously is bright."
2,Too Bright,"While this clock has a nice, large, easy to read display, the green light of the numbers is way too bright for a bedroom. I found myself constantly turning the clock so it would face away from me and towards the wall, but even that didn't seem to help, as the light reflected off of the walls and still lit up the room. Unless you want your alarm clock to also serve as a night light--I would recommend against it."
4,Great Clock!,I'm very pleased with this purchase. Large LED display makes it easy to see from across the room - day or night. Simple setup for time and alarm. Even has a dimmer switch. For the money you can't go wrong with this clock.
2,Looks worn out,Display is very disappointing. The segments vary a great deal in intensity. It looks like a tired video game that has been on continuously since the 1980s.
1,Waste of money,"Don't buy this if you live outside america... I did and it blew up due to the voltage difference. My fault I guess, but it didn't occur to me before buying it. Also the plug shape is US shape."
1,the times slows dwon about 10 mins each hour,"I just bought this clock from amazon and it looks nicely, but I got a big problem the clock shows slower about 10 mins each hours. I'm now using it in Europe (power supply by a converter from 220V to 110V), I'm not sure what reason causes this problem (different location or the clock quality?)"
3,"Nice Clock, but better to get the Red LED version","The clock works great and the large LED display is fantastic, especially if your vision is not all that great. However, for the same price you can get the red LED version of the clock that comes with all the same features PLUS the ""Set and Forget Technology"" that automatically sets the time (e.g. after a power failure it will continue to display the correct time)."
3,quiet,"Easy to read, easy to set, but the alarm is incredibly quiet. Cannot rouse a person with hearing loss."
2,"Unfortunately, the brightest bulb in the bunch","While the description of this clock says it has a ""dimmer"", the truth is that it does not. There is a switch that allows you to choose between very-bright and very-very-bright, but there is no dimmer control that allows for useful adjustment of the brightness. If you have this clock close to your bed, you may have to sleep facing away from it."
3,Chaney Alarm clock,"We had to replace the first one, the snooze alarm did not function. Replacement works fine. It is a simple, easy to use clock with very big numbers. My only complaint is that it is very bright in the middle of the night. The dimmer function does not dim it very much."
2,Not working and shipping was awful.,I ordered this watch to give as a gift to my uncle. It came later than the scheduled arrival date by 4 days and its box (not the cartoon box of amazon) is cheap plastic that makes me embarrassed to give it as a gift in it. Beside the watch is NOT WORKING. I have to take it to change the battery hoping its only a battery issue.Next time I will go to the store and buy from their collection better than dealing with such hassle.I give it only 2 stars because I like its 2 tone bracelet.
1,nice watch...for something...,"I ordered this watch as a gift. It was exactly as I'd hoped it would appear, like a nice piece of jewelry, attractive and not obtrusive, while still being easy to read the time. All at a great price as well. And Amazon shipped it very quickly.What's disappointing is that it didn't work at all, right out of the box. Attempts to contact the manufacturer have produced no replies, which seems less than admirable for a respectable company.Amazon will refund readily if requested to, a generous policy.. but the point is that they shipped an item that never worked in the first place. It may need a battery, but that needs to be done by a jeweler- an added out of pocket expense- IF that's even the problem...Ordered items should not be shipped out in a defective state."
2,"Ooooh, scary ninja *rowing*","Aside from the fact that rowing ninjas is hardly menacing, I feel that the whole red ninja thing is pretty lame. I mean, where are they going to hide in that outfit? An apple factory?Pick up another set with black ninjas, and minus the oars. You'll thank me for it."
5,Freer is Awesome!,"Neil Freer is an amazing writer. Although you may need a dictionary to get thru some of the chapters, He ties together all the Sitchin theories with the confidence of an educated man. If you are a fan of Sitchin's work this is a MUST READ!"
3,Slow Moving But Worth Sticking With,It is true to Zecharia Sitchin theme but maybe a little too dry and philosophical but it's worth the read.
2,Not very good binoculars,"These do not use a focus knob and instead are set to 'infinity' for focal distance. Instead of everything being in focus, essentially, everything is just a bit out of focus.For this price point, I wish I hadn't bought these binoculars and instead had just spent more time shopping eBay or Craigslist for a set of higher-quality used binoculars."
4,New Century Binoculars,"Binoculars were defective when I received them (bell housing was installed crooked). It took me several tries to contact seller. Seller advised that I had to return them to mfg. It cost me an additional $12to ship to mfg. It was over two weeks before I received new binoculars.Extra costs, extra time."
5,The One Shining Exception,"... As a recent graduate (Microbiology, BS), I have had my experiences with poorly written textbooks, but this book was the one shining exception. I, like many others, feared organic chemistry. However, this book breaks the intricacies of organic chemistry up into easy-to-understand steps which gives the student the necessary foundation to build upon, learn, and ultimately understand organic chemistry in a way that is efficient as well as long-lasting. Rather than memorizing mechanisms, the student is able to ""work-through"" the mechanism based on previous knowledge. I know this because I have read this book, cover-to-cover, and had only wished that my other text books were as well thought out and helpful as this one! ! . This book was not only written by an expert in organic chemistry, but by an expert in teaching as well. I have had my copy of this book since 1995 and still refer to it today. I highly recommend this book to students and teachers alike."
5,Bruice's book is amazing!,"Dr. Bruice does an excellent job conveying the material and adds great trivia about scientists and interesting compounds (like the section on mustard gas). One of the best parts of the book is the use of color, which adds to the readability of the text. However, I don't think Dr. Bruice covered enough molecular orbital theory, and a more in-depth discussion of stereochemistry would be helpful. But overall, this book is great and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,GE Cordless Handset Phone,"I purchased this style because it was the correct model for my existing expandable phones. I shopped a lot for the right phone for my needs. Although I think that the panasonic brand is better, I don't like the small size buttons on the panasonic, and this GE has buttons that are much easier to use. This phone also has good lighting on the numbers. What I don't like about this phone is that I have to delete each number separately. I also don't like that only the base lights when there is an incoming call, not the extensions. But the cost of these 4 phones was much less than other models, and I do find this phone much easier to use than other brands which I also tried and returned to the stores."
5,A 4th phone for my home,I am not real good at electronic things. I got this phone online with the other phones in less than a half an hour (after the charge time). The reception is clear so I am very pleased.
4,Decent 5.8 GHz Phone for the $,Have used sister to this phone for 2 yrs. without one problem. Useful features with good sound.
1,Misleading,"The phone is labeled as Telephone and Accessory Handset but that is not what is on the box. It says very clearly ""does not work independently"" and it does not say that on product description.I have a regular GE 29267GE3-B and that is why I chose GE over Panasonic. Sadly I have to return it because I only need one phone and this is a phone to buy if you already have the base station and what to add another handset."
1,Answer Machine Didn't Work,"Right out of the box the answering machine didn't function. Called their worthless technical support who could offer nothing more than ""unplug the phone"" as a solution.NOTE: If yours does work GE expects you to pay for shipping the unit back."
1,Garbage,"This phone is garbage. If I had to do it all over again, I would put more money in to buy a panasonic phone. The phone has lot of static and people I talk to complain that they can't hear me well. I also have an ATT phone on the same line, and that one works great!"
1,Another Pice of Cheap Chinese Junk,"After spending a considerable amount of time searching for a new electric skillet on Amazon and finding that many did not have good reviews, we decided to try the Elite Gourmet. You guessed it, it looks like another piece of cheap Chinese junk. The biggest disappointment was learning that it cannot be immersed in water for cleaning. The only reason we are going to keep it is that I do not want to pay the $9.49 shipping charges to return it. I purchase very few things online and probably will not purchase anything at all in the future - have learned the hard way that things are usually misrepresented, and you cannot depend on any quality no matter what price you pay. Too bad we now live in the U.S.A. but do our shopping in China and Mexico."
1,DO NOT buy!!!!,"Make sure you look closely. The hat says United ""STATE"" Marine Corps!They should pull this hat out of sales. As a 3rd Generation Marine, I am offended!"
1,Mistake,"I wish I had not purchased this product: very heavy, clumsy, uncomfortable boots. Good color is an asset. Nothing else is."
3,Very general overview of the human body,This is a good resource for an abbreviated overview of the body. It does not get as indepth as I would like it to for my anatomy students.
1,didnt fit,"although i purchased this replacement filter basket for the correct model number, it doesn't fit and is worthless. Not worth the cost of postage to send it back."
4,Great book,"This book has great projects in it. I honestly can't say that I've made any of them yet because I'm more of a book collector/dreamer who says, ""wow what a great idea!"", then doesn't actually do anything with it. That being said, when I do finally get back to this book I'm sure the instructions will be easy to understand."
3,A bit vague,"This book was short and sweet, however lacked details that I was trying to find regarding breastfeeding and proper diet. If you are looking for a quick read and some general ideas about eating healthy while nursing, this book is for you. If you are looking for more strict guidelines and in depth nutritional information, I would pass this one up."
4,Useful first book on topic,The book is a good stepping stone on the subject of difference equations. The book covers the basics. The reader will be prepared to study a more recent textbook on the subject. The book contains many examples from social science that I skipped.
3,Navigation Needs Improvement - Remove Topic Headers,"As the text is the standardized NKJV it is the format and functionality that I am reviewing.I gave this NKJV version three stars because of what I feel are two shortcomings.Fist, compared to the OSNOVA Bible offerings its navigation is slow and cumbersome.For the cost, compared to other Kindle Bibles, I feel it should have a far better navigation system.Second, I do not care for the LARGE PRINT topic headers at the beginning of most paragraphs. They take up too much room and clutter the text. I personally prefer a text without ANY notes, headers, etc.I have had the Nelson printed edition for years and while it does have a 'topic' notation at the top of the pages it DOES NOT have these interspersed within the text so they don't clutter the text.James"
4,TERRIFIC BIBLE..limits downloads,"this is a terrific edition. that said...bear in mind that you are paying for about 7 downloads.... if you are a gadet freak like i am, this will be a problem for you because you will want this terrific bible on ALL compatible devices. Since amazon keeps adding more devices that can read kindle books (software for comp, kindles,ipad, iphone, android...etc) I wish this publisher wouldn't limit the number of devices I can download this Bible to. but..oh well. just thought you should know."
3,"Outstanding Price, But The Print is Super Tiny","You can't beat $3. This Thomas Nelson Bible is just over 500 pages and is divided into a three-column typesetting that I have never seen in any other Bible. At the top of each page you will find subject headings. A short three page introduction is provided that is followed by a New King James Version preface and table of contents. The special introduction contains a very brief history of the Bible, an outline of the most beloved portions of Scripture and some suggestions on how to begin reading your Bible. Unfortunately the print is so tiny that it always makes my middle schoolers gasp when I show it to them. If you are looking to own or give away a bunch of inexpensive Bibles, this Bible might be for you."
3,Great Leather and Craftmanship - Found a typo,"I remain disappointed with this Bible because within the first 30 minutes of owning it, I found a typo. In the Bible dictionary, in the W's, I found the word ""Wonderifully"". Big deal? No. But it made me doubt the quality control that went into the rest of it. Besides that...I think the Bible is wonderiful. It smells great and feels good when you hold it...which are literally 2 of the most important things I look for in a Bible. The size is perfect for traveling and preaching. I love it...except for that typo, which I can't seem to get out of my head."
1,A Mediocre Macabre Story took too seriously.,"I must say, this book was a disappointment, It's plot holes, macabre, and shock value centric efforts come up short with the awkward ending and pretentious claims about the validity of the content. Overall a confusing, dim-witted attempt at moral ingenuity."
1,Ha ha ha,"As a history book, this volume holds some merit--it is a really old book after all. The trouble is, people keep wanting to make this book into more than it is, to the point that people use its contents as a convenient excuse to deprive others of valuable resources and keep said resources for themselves. I don't think banning books is appropriate, but something needs to be done to rein in the folks who claim that their religion, based on this book and others like it, dictates that their discriminatory acts against others are justified.Edit: grammar correction (9-10-11)"
1,A wonderful cure for insomnia!,"I was told this was the greatest book ever written by the greatest author that ever existed, but I'm surprised at what got past the editors..."
1,Where is the main plot line?,"The first part was really interesting what with all the destruction, etc. However, there were too many characters and I got lost in all the side stories. Then in the second part, they introduce a whole new set of characters, a few thousand years in the future, about some guy with a Spanish name. They get off track a lot and there are some plot inconsistencies... But overall, they really need a better copy editor than King James. What the heck was he doing editing anyway.. didn't he have a country to run? That is like Sylvester Stallone winning the Miss America pageant or Steve Jobs becoming a professional wrestler... it just doesn't make sense."
1,Worst Fiction Ever!,"This book stinks to high whatever worst fiction I have ever read and the characters are about as dumb as they come. The beginning is all over the place Adam and Eve are created together than the next chapter Eve is pulled out of Adams rib come on you would think the authors could do better fiction than that! And then it gets worse rape, plunder, slavery destruction of all humanity you would think the author's were all psychotic. Than there is the next book the new testament which doesn't get any better they have this Jesus character tortured to death and make him a symbol. And then the last book revelations is so wacked out and bent on killing every one you'd think the author was on high on Mushrooms or some other psychotic drug. If you want some good fiction stick to more modern such as Harry Potter. Warning this book should have restrictions for minors do to the overly gross and sadistic writings."
4,Like it.,"Like it..A bit tricky finding the chapter and verse. Like the font size and the book is not heavy, the pages don't slip out of the hand or get dog eared and I did not have to put those chapter tabs on, which then rip the page or get bent under."
5,Excellent Kindle Bible,This Bible works very well on Kindle devices. Navigation to specific chapters is relatively easy. Highly recommended. The only thing I dislike is that I would like new chapters to always be on a new page.
5,The new king James version,This is the version that we use where i attend bible study. This version lists each verse seperately which i like. I would reccomend this version to others.
3,It's OK,"The paper isn't the best but it will do. Looks nice, and grandchild likes it. Different colors for each boy limits arguments.Print is large enough."
3,Compact Bible,"Received order in a timely manner; however, the print is very small and unless you have 20/20 vision you must wear reading glasses to see. I do love the compact size, but I have seen other compacts with larger print."
4,Large Print NKJ Bible,This product helped me to return to reading the Bible due to decreased vision. I received the product in a timely manner and it was in good condition as promised.
3,Navigation cumbersome,"Not easy to navigate through like other Kindle books. Going to other books in the Bible, or specific verses requires going back to table of contents. Would not have purchased this on Kindle if I had known that."
4,non-fiction,Very historically accurate portrayal of what actually happened. I finally realize that Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are LIES. The magic in this book is more realistic.
2,disappointed,"The NKJV Study Bible: Second EditionI love my paper edition of this book. I was excited to get it on my Kindle. However, this is what is wrong. 1: You don't know where you are. All you see is a location #. 2: There is no subject index. 3: How can this be a study bible without study notes? There aren't any! 4: God's words aren't in red 5: The search location only wants a #, not for instance Mark:2-12. I have to go back to the table of contents to go from one author to another. I don't think a bible Scholor wrote this software. Disappointed in Ca. Janice Allen"
1,Its terrible,"Seriously. Dont buy this book. the paper it is printed on is terrible. Mine fell apart in the rain when I was out preaching to people. I was so embarassed, but it was ok because I went to this place called a ""church"" and there was loads there. So I took one. Free.My advice:: Seek a church and borrow one. Or just keep it."
1,Oh please....,"Poorly constructed story line, the author obviously was too pompous to hire a good editor, they would have told them that it was unbelievable and poorly written. Even Twilight is more readable than this!"
3,It drops after the first half.,"The first half of the book was pretty great. Full of action and sex. But the second half just seemed preachy. And the author decided to introduce a whole new character to the plot. And the epilogue was to complex and full of metaphor. But when he blew up those cities I was like ""This is SO GOD DAMN COOL!"""
2,Misrepresenting Add,"I should have known better, the price was too good. The Bible was in no way leather, the pages are a very cheap, poor quality. This is a Bible to leave around home. I wish I had read the reviews. Will need to reorder ! ! !"
1,Blasphemy!,"King James has taken some of his inspiration from Pastafarianism, but corrupted its message beyond all recognition. There is no mention of Pirates, or the Heavenly beer volcano, or His Divine Noodliness, the FSM.Save your immortal saucy-souls, and rejoice in the one true book,The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"
2,Meh,"I probably shouldn't have seen the movie first. The ending is real trippy, but it takes too long to get there. There's a huge cliffhanger at the end that was probably a set up for a sequel that will never be written, though.The first half is better. In fact, you can totally disregard the second part entirely. It was an unnecessary addition. The author accomplishes everything needed by the end of the first part."
1,Do people really still believe this stuff???,"In short, a bunch of primitive stories tied together by a narcissistic, murderous protagonist with a split personality (Jesus and some other ghost), who will send people to eternal hell just for the fact that they do not worship Him, or something like that. Clearly, the book needed better copy editing, as it's full of contradictions."
1,Poorly written horror book about an awful dicator called God.,"The bible is a poorly written book that does not contribute to believing in the Christian god whatsoever, quite the opposite. It's absolutely filled with contradictions after contradictions, factual and scientific error, false history and lies.The book is only valid as a book of fiction to understand why our history has been filled with genocide and murder.If the holy bible had at least been well written I would have given it 2 points but it's just so awful in every way that it would not be honest to do so."
1,Didn't get it,"Still scratching my head over this one. It starts with the story of a talking snake and ends with a story about a seven headed dragon. In the middle there were stories about swarms of frogs, lice, locusts and flies; bears eating kids; talking donkeys; a giant fish ate a guy at one point; there were swine that go crazy and jump off of cliffs; there was this guy who made a big boat and filled it with all kinds of animals and then floated around for awhile following birds.Even though there was some sex, murder and magic in it, it was overall a weird, disjointed rambling book that didn't make much sense."
3,Rough,"The story line is a little choppy, although the use of multiple authors/editors was a really good attempt at progressive writing. Any sense of progress, however, is lost due to the convoluted story line and highly conservative main characters.Now, in some books, they put pictures of the author or characters in the middle. This brick of a novel has some archaically worded poetry. It doesn't rhyme, and is fairly inconsistant.I enjoyed the character developement. If the main character, God, had stayed vengefull and violent, who knows where the story could have gone? Admittedly the turnaround is a little abrupt. Most of my fantasy-fiction friends usually tell me not to read the back of the book first, but I couldn't resist seeing the ending. It's pretty spectacular. It doesn't seem very well connected to the rest of the book though."
1,Terrible.,"Don't waste your time. I once spent years studying this failure of epic proportions. The porn scenes are the only juicy bits, and those are sometimes way too strange. Pluses: Includes good tips and how-tos on rape, stoning, and slave-beating. Also includes bits about talking animals and other magic. Could use a revision."
2,Meh,"I'd have to say I liked Bullfinch's Mythology better. The stories seemed more real and the characters more believable than this ""god"" character. If you're looking for myths, go pick up Bullfinch. You won't be disappointed."
5,My lovely Bible,"I need a Bible for travel. That is it! I love this Bible, good readable and portable. And Merry Christmas for Christ."
5,New King James Bible,The Word of God is always welcome in our home! I've recently discovered the New King James and looking forward to reviewing some of my favorite passages to see how they compare to other versions.
3,NKJB,Not as easy to use as I hoped it would be. There should be an easy way to go right to the table of contents to look up books and chapters of the Bible.
2,Poor Quality,"I was disappointed in the quality of this Bible. The pages were like ""newspaper"" print, the font was really small. If you're looking for a ""cheep"" Bible, this is it--if you're giving it to a poor kid or a prisoner who doesn't have a Bible or someone you suspect might just throw it away or scribble in it or something, then it will do the job. But, if you are looking for something to last you for years to come, don't bother with this one, it is scraping the bottom of the barrel. You get what you pay for, and as long as you pay less than $1 for it plus a couple bucks shipping--you got your money's worth."
3,Small Font Bibles,"I have purchased Nelson NKJV papterback bibles before and was well pleased. However, the new bibles use less paper because the font is very small, most persons will need reading glasses. I'd rather pay a $1 more per bible for larger type. I usually purchase 10 - 20 at a time and hand them out. Blessings, In Jesus' Name. Psalm 91"
1,Scientifically Inaccurate From The Jump,"For a book that boasts of its ""Truth"" claims, right off the bat, it describes simple optics (physics) incorrectly. There cannot be light without a light source (Gen. 1:-3-4) - some form of entity that emits electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. In the third sentence of the text, this so-called light is made ""days"" before the Sun and neighboring stars (supposedly placed billions of light years away, yet immediately visible from Earth). And if HE is the light source...why and how did He ""let there be light""?The lead character, Yahweh, supposedly possessing direct access to everyone of every language all of the time, is a horrible communicator and, for something that allegedly created the universe in its entirety, very emotional and petty."
3,Good price but small print,"This bible has good, reasonable price, lightweight with small fine print so it comes in handy for young people and missionaries."
5,Using My New King James Bible,Since i down loaded my New King James version it is used whin i go to church. It is much faster to get around from passage to passage and keep up with the teaching.
1,The Holy Bible = Hearsay evidence,"The bible is a poorly written thought virus that was used by the Romans to control their slaves. Many of the Romans living today have admitted to the lie. As for me, I depend on logic and real historical documents, not inadmissable evidence like the bible. Science explains things much better than so-called biblical ""doctrine."" To live a religious life, one must be able to lack the ability to reason and thus allow blind faith to consume their minds. I choose understanding and the simple life gift of knowledge. The truth is more appealing to me than comforting lies, myths, fables, and poetry."
1,The Most Amazing Work of Literature known to Mankind,"Obviously the best translation ever written. I am sure that if Jesus SPOKE English, he would speak the king's English! Obviously the infallbile KJV stands alone as a paragon of exactitude, percisION, undeniability, brevity, bombastictness and hysterectomy. The time has come to stop listening to those liberal sceintists who throw fact IN our face and tell us to be reasonable. Those ""older"" manuscripts are obviously made of printer-paper with tea-water stains and CANNOT be trusted! Scholarly research is nothing in the light of THE WORD OF GOD!Trust convention! Yield to authority!"
1,Printed in China!!,Printed in a country that persecutes Christians!! Sick!! Thomas Nelson! Shame on you!! This is so very saddening that you do this and then charge so much for your bibles.
1,NKJ version not for christians.,"In the King James versions, the writing was as it should be,and certain words in the old way had a specific meaning.When updated to our way ofspeaking,the NKJV has taken out those key words corrupting the meaningand will of God.If you are christian,the KJV is the only version you cantrust."
1,The Gospel? (spoilers),"I picked this up because I heard it advertised as the Gospel, which translates to ""good news."" It opens up by telling the reader how the human race is doomed because two poorly developed characters ate an apple that a snake told them to eat.That's not good news.I can't say I found much good news at all in this. It actually closes by telling us that the world is going to end, and how we should all be prepared.I would not recommend this book to others. It does not deliver on many of its advertised promises, and features weak characters and archaic diction."
2,damaged,"The book was not very good quality and we returned it without problem because of our dissatisfaction. The bible itself is always good and deserves five stars, but this particular one is not well printed."
1,"Works missing, may be a forgery","I purchased this book in hopes of finally discovering God's grace. What I received was something else entirely. The first four books of the New Testament were all the same story told with entirely different details! Get it together, King James! Also, the Gospels of Thomas and Judas were missing. There was no mention of Allah, Vishnu, or Thor, who were my favorite apostles. The Heaven's Gate chapter had been ripped out completely. This book leaves a lot to be desired. I'm going to look for a new Bible. This time I'll pray to Thoth, the God of Wisdom, before I begin my search."
2,not real leather and heavy,"While any Bible is nice to have, this book is misrepresented as being leather which it is not. The print size is probably about 12 point, possibly a little bigger, but not what I would call giant. I don't think anyone produces a real leather bible for less than 30 dollars, so you get what you pay for. That said, Nelson could do better in this price range."
1,Too long and boring,"Main character is too full of himself, not relatable I read a few pages then threw it under the couch."
5,Ancient Nomadic Studies,"If you are looking for a good treatise on ancient nomadic beliefs, this one is a great resource!I've read it several times and it never fails to give a chuckle."
1,Mediocre fiction!,"Wow! Talk about wordy! This poor attempt at fiction is just way too long! Frankly, I wouldn't wipe my butt with it!"
4,nice read,"Nice easy to carry size. Text is easy to read. Paper is very thin, using an hilighter is not recommended. Since paper is very thin, looking for a specific book is more difficult."
2,Terrible paper quality,"The binding is very good. The size of the print is good. The problem is excessive bleed through of the next page. Every Bible has some bleed through: You can see a bit of the next page through the page you are reading, but it is not noticeable. This Bible on the other hand, has paper quality so poor that the next page is way too obvious through the page you are reading, and is really bad in the red letter portions. This causes eye strain.One other criticism I have is there is practically no margins for even small notes. This Bible would be perfect with better quality paper, and at least the minimum margins found in other Bibles. I am returning this Bible."
2,Poor navigation,"The content of the Holy Bible, New King James Version is excellent. The language is much easier to understand than the Standard King James Version. The navigation is very poor. There is no provision to click on one of the 66 books of the Bible and go directly to that book. The background information given on each book of the bible is great. But when I want to go directly to the 13th chapter of Acts, I find my paper copy to be simpler and easier."
3,NKJV Large Print UltraSlim Bible,I agree that the cover is of very low quality and the pictured shown was a blue Bible which was what I was looking for.The print is ok but not a true large print Bible. May be why the had price reduced. Would not buy to give as a gift. JH
3,Mediocre quality printing,"This is a review of the paperback KJV. The publisher has provided a compact and inexpensive edition, probably best suited as a back-up reference copy for English majors or a portable copy for people who want to travel with this book. The paper is poor quality and the typeface is fairly small, making this a difficult edition to read easily. The only content added to the basic KJV is a table of contents, a brief index with topics such as ""vitamins for the soul"", and a reasonably useful glossary/concordance at the back, in case you want to know what leprosy is or who Aaron was. Proper names in the text itself are given with phonetic aids (syllabification, stress marks, and vowel quality signs), which you may or may not appreciate. On balance, the book is probably fairly priced -- it's a cheap, mediocre printing."
2,"Text is good, needs chapter navigation","The text is fine; it's readable, although I prefer paragraph layout (this book is in verse layout: each verse starts a new line.)The only real problem I have is that while there are bookmarks for each book, there are no bookmarks for the chapters. So if you need to get deep in to a book, you have to flip through LOTS of pages. The NIV Bible here goes too far: it has verse bookmarks (that's a little TOO much detail.)"
3,NKJV Large UltaSlim Bible,"It is a pretty good edition for a child of 10 to 14 years of age. The reason for this is, it is pretty low quality for weathering the years of bible study. Also the pages aren't bright white and the print is somewhat small.The concordance is pretty basic and there are no maps. It is a good start to teaching children to care for a more solid bible but it isn't the best for study helps, word definitions or introductions to a book of the bible (there are none). If you have a Bible concordance already , this will help, other than that, I'm afraid, you are on your own."
1,not what i expected,i ordered 10 large print bibles. i got 10 regular print bibles. my class has older students . and we were praying for new bibles. well we got 10 new regular print.those of you that are ordering for a large group be careful.i will keep them . because maybe the lord has a plan for them
2,Disappointed,"This Bible is great if you have 20/15 vision. The version is as ordered. However, knowing the price was so low it must not be as advertised, I ordered only one of the 15 I needed. If you 'look on the inside' it shows only 29 verses on page one; however, in the book I received, it not only includes all 31 verses of chapter 1 but also all of chapter 2 and 13 verses of chapter 3.The font is just too small; I can't give this Bible to individuals whose vision is not almost beyond perfect unless I include a great magnifying glass."
4,I very much like it,I trust the name Thomas NelsonI think it is easy to useI like having a concorance to look things up
5,NKJ Bible,New King James Bible...this Bible has a lot more to it than the other Bibles...in the front of the Bible it has how the Bible came about and what it is
2,Print too small,"I purchased this Bible as a gift for a child, but after receiving it, I havedecided against this as a gift. The print is very small, too small even for me.The words of Christ are not in red, which I think is very important. The pricewas inexpensive, but remember you get what you pay for, and I would not recommendthis paperback version to anyone."
4,Large print is easy to read,"I love the large print, but it does make the Bible large and rather heavy. It does have references and a concordance. The cover is kind of flimsy, so make sure you have a sturdy cover for it. Good value for the very low price."
2,not a good quality of paper and finish!,i was disappointed in the quality of this bible and i agree with an earlier review that the item as pictured here is not the same as the cover of the bible that you actually receive
1,Print too small,"I'm sorry that I had to return the Bibles I had ordered for gifts, but the print is simply too small. I was disappointed that I was unable to use these Bibles."
2,Not large,"Th use of the expressions [LARGE PRINT] and (Leather Bound) are misleading, as pointed out by earlier reviewers. I am now selling the book, unread."
2,Don't Purchase This Item - Table of Contents Does Not WORK!,"I bought the NJKV to use for general reading and study, however, to my disappointment I found that the table of contents doesn't work. If you click on ""New Testament"" you are given an option to view all the books and chapters, however, if you click on them nothing happens. The only way to find your way around this e-Bible is by turning one page at a time. I'm very unimpressed!"
3,Don't Read the Old Testament,"The physical quality of the Bible is superb, considering its low cost.The text of the New Testament is good. Jesus promotes many positive values.However, the Old Testament portrays Yahweh, a cruel being who enjoys watching slaughter. Do not share the Old Testament with your children.But Ecclesiastes is good."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Initially when I searched for Bibles, I was looking for Giant/Large print, so that Ididn't have to strain my eyes. This book came up in the listing, so I thought, how cool, a Bible thatis easy to handle, slim/sleek, and large print. Well to my surprise, It did not have large print, also, thepages are extremely thin. This book before long will not be able to survive normal wear and tear.I do love how the book is outlined, and has family registry, and the maps. I think it would be a great starters Bible, but not for me."
2,NKJV,Great price but the print is way toooo small!!! Consider another option if your eyes are 40 years or older!
5,Bible review,"I love the New King James Version of The Holy Bible. Just like the KJV is the update to contempory English, so is the NKJV."
1,Not a very good eBook,"I downloaded the NKJV to my Kindle touch today. In less than five minutes trying to navigate I returned it. Periodicals (I have a World Magazine subscription) have an awesome navigation and eBooks like this should be done the same way.A bible is NOT a book. People who use their bible reference more than read it... Also, they reference it by book, chapter and verse and not simply by chapter. My suggestion is that Nelson go back to the drawing board.First, don't show all chapters of a book in the navigation page. Simply show books. When the user clicks on a book, then show the chapters. This way the user has access to more than four or five books per screen. In fact, done properly, there is no reason the user couldn't see the entire old testament on one screen and select a book.I'm really disappointed in the quality here. Who at TN said this was good?"
1,The Holy Bible: New King James Version (NKJV),"The print is too small, I wish this was noted before I purchased the bible. I did notify the seller, and they was willing to refund half the cost, but that was not necessary. I wanted to know if they had the bible in a larger print, but they did not indicate that. I will donate the this bible."
1,Not what I was expecting.,"When I reviewed this bible before ordering I looked at the sample and thought the type was going to be alot bigger! The picture shown was the same bible but when you click on the link to sample the pages inside it brings up an entirely different bible than the one that I received. Very disappointing, I even bought 2 of them so my husband could also have one. But the type is very very small. And it is 3 column pages not 2 columns. Very hard to read. Not sure if I will keep them (because they didn't cost very much) or just return them. Again very disappointing. :("
1,Deceptive packaging,"One of the requirements I had for my Bible was a colorful cover. The image and description lead you to believe that this has a colorful cover of green, blue, and red. In reality, it is solid red(ish).I didn't look at the other aspects of the Bible, but if you were also attracted to the appearance of this particular version, go elsewhere unless you wanted a solid redish colored cover."
2,Meh.,"Honestly, I found the old testament to be a very interesting read, but I never was able to get through the new testament.If it was just the old I'd probably 4 star it."
1,Why does our savior have a mexican name?,"You know what's funny? Monkeys and Midgets. You know what's not? This book, it's serious. Don't buy it. Get a copy from a Jehova's witness next time they come to your door."
2,scratched cover,"Bible size and font size are great, but I received this product in its original packaging and there was a big scratch across the cover. I wanted to have it embossed and given as a gift, but had to buy another bible at a book store so I could guarantee the quality. I was very disappointed."
1,Problems with navigation,"There is a problem with navigation. I have the touch. When I turn the page every 3rd page jumps to some sort of index, not the table of contents. I'd then have to go to the table of contents to start over at the chapter I was reading. This renders this unreadable."
3,The fine print,The fine print is very difficult to read. The text is in three columns. It isn't for reading very long.
4,The bible on Kindle,"I purchased the Bible on Kindle to save carrying around a huge book with me, that was the No 1 advantage.Because the Bible is not an ordinary book to read from start to finish, I have found it time consuming and frustrating to find a chapter/verse as quickly as having the actual book in front of me."
5,man cant liv on bread alone hey alo need this book,Amazing. i couldnt ask for more. i could read this overand over again. if you love god this is the book for you. thas all
4,large print bible,The print was not as large as I thought. bible was readable and in very good condition.thank you very much
1,GIANT print not GIANT,"Hello,I bought this Bible for my grandmother who has macular degeneration and specifically requested GIANT print - the only print she can still read!Well, after she received the Bible and couldn't read it she complained to me that this GIANT print is no larger than LARGE print and asked if I can return it...I'm not sure ~ can I?"
1,Awesome!!!,This book is amazing it really helped me learn about God an Jesus how he save me an Everton around me and that when we die we will live with him for eternity
1,Not as good as Lord of the Rings,"The story had it's highs i suppose but mostly it had lows. Its a good idea i guess, if you've never read creationist stories before, (personally i recommend the ""Epic of Gilgamesh"") but what mostly gets me is the blatant plagiarism and how the author doesn't even cite his sources. Its story telling qualities are good and even the incredible stretches in reality can be conceived as plausible thanks to the world the author has created in this story, but then the events and circumstance change without explanation. All in all I would not recommend this book to other readers."
1,Doesn't work when I pray and ask for stuff.,This book is faulty. It doesn't work when I pray for an Audi R8. I tried to pray for something less expensive and it still doesn't show up in front of me. If people can part seas with prayers then I should be able to at least get shaved ice cream.
1,NOT King James; Yuck,"What is a ""new King James""?It is not a King James translation that is The Great Code, the Auld Book substrate of modern English lit. This is dull witted turnip pietism. I will even feel icky about dumping it in the neighborhood used bookstore's Free Books."
2,DON'T SPEND THE MONEY,"The navigation is thoughtless.... You will spend more time locating a verse then reading it... Not to mention, once you are there there is no way to tell what book or chapter you are in... UGH!"
4,Yea is quite a good book,"There arent enough good fights in this book and I think harry potter is better at magic than Jerus. Some magic was great like the feeding of one hundred from only ten or eleven fish but apart from that nothing special. Read most but not all of it as after Noer, it was kind of boring. That guy lived for years!! Update: Finished. Good ending."
1,"Too long, Repetative, Taken too seriously.","This book is far too long for a work of fiction. The constant repeats of phrases and the terrible character development make 'Twilight' look like an amazing work.The writing style is childish at best, and the plots don't even run together! Seriously, this ""King"" James needs to relearn his grammar and sentence structure before trying to get this block of terrible published again."
3,"compact, but not leather.","As the description says, it is a compact bible, but the cover is pretty flimsy and not at all manufactured using leather. The print is probably about 11 point, not terribly large. It's an ok bible, but not gift quality. If you want a real leather equivalent, I recommend the Holman Ultra-thin Large Print Reference (ISBN # 978-1-55819-652-0) which is Korean made (10 point print) and real genuine leather. It also costs twice as much. So you get what you pay for."
1,Fiction,"As a story goes this isn't the worst thing you could read. Its comparable to a lot of other tall tales and much more Gorey and violent. Its a long read.This should be relocated into collected works or the fiction category.As a religious text, I do not see merit.Ideally if you would like to learn about how we came to be or the planet Science & Nature books would be better for you.If you would like to learn how to act children's books and fables will outline what society considers acceptable behavior and will be much more entertaining.If you want to broaden your imagination, Plenty of other books have alternate realities where you will still need to suspend your beliefs as to what can really happen and are much more entertaining/rewarding. You would do better to read The Hobbit, Harry Potter, or other fantasy books.I would not recommend this book to a friend."
1,"Poor, boring and full of fallacies","Although it has been written more than 2000 years ago, I still would have expected more from such a best seller. It's very badly written, slow, almost childish at times. It was very difficult to finish and the numerous errors and inconsistencies leave the reader somewhat cheated. It's a no buy."
3,"Well, it's a Bible","It's a Bible, so you know what is in it. I am judging it just for its readability. The print size is fine and the word and sentence spacing is fine too. However, the pages are too translucent. There is too much of the print from the opposite side of the paper showing though. This makes the Bible harder to read than it needs to be. I would prefer a bit thicker Bible with less see-through paper."
1,Makes Lord Of The Rings Seems Like A Short Story,"This book is like a version of the Mobius Strip - the more you try to follow it, the more you keep going round and round in never-ending circles as you try to keep track of the myriad of characters and the massive number of plot holes and inconsistencies."
5,Excellent,I was very pleased with this Bible. It is the perfect size to handle. This was a Christmas gift and he loved it. It was exactly what he wanted.
2,Not the version I intended to order,"My intent was to receive the King James version of the Bible.The new Kings James was too advanced.The receivers were new converts,and the New King James is a bit overwhelming for them."
2,Simply Would Not Function,"This is an old-fashioned train set: durable, simple, with exposed wiring (very safe). But, despite huge effort, we simply could not get it to go fully around the track. The wheels of the lead locomotive, the one that supplies the power, simply would not stay in the groove. After 45 minutes, it had not been able to make even a single pass around the track.I've built a lot of toys, and have a technical background, so obvious ""you don't know what you are doing"" problems are not the root cause. My wife and kid spent a bunch of time working on it, too. It's a gift, so we cannot return it, and don't want to give it to anyone else.Extremely disappointing. A waste, really."
4,fun starter train set,"I've wanted to create a train display/scene for a few years, but it's not an inexpensive hobby. My husband got this set (my first) for me for Christmas, and I am delighted. It has just enough track, cars, and people to get me started. Although it isn't terribly powerful, it is possible to add more a bit more track and cars at a later date. It's easy to put together.It's a great size for going around the Christmas tree, too!"
4,Translation is Good,"I bought the E version of this book, which I read a version of, because of the good English translation avoiding the traditional archaic language of other versions."
3,Very difficult,"I got this one because I'm familiar with Uri's playing with Dave Douglas. I figured it might be a strange album, but I underestimated how strange it was for me. This album doesn't have much jazz in it. The title track, ""Shining Trumpets"", and ""St. Anthony"" are the jazziest ones, and my favorites. Many of the other songs have voiceovers, most commonly a German voice which sounds like it was taken from ""Cabaret"". There's also some spoken English and Chinese. Since I'm unfamiliar with the context, and German and Chinese languages, the spoken pieces don't grab me.I just found it difficult to listen to, and it doesn't make a lot of sense to me as a whole. This album may be a five-star album for someone else."
1,Aweful,The product was extremely disappointing. I used this as a snack for elementary school kids and they did not like the chips.
5,"A little blackmail, anyone?","Antony Maitland is deeply involved in a case. He's looking forward to a little rest when he gets home. What he gets instead is a visit from good friend, Meg Hamilton. Meg is an actress by profession, but her visit is strictly personal--the man she wants to marry is about to be charged with murder, and she wants Antony to Do Something.Roger Farrell is the man, and his story is simple enough. His mother was being blackmailed, and rather than ask for help, she killed herself. The police think that Roger has tracked down the blackmailer and killed him. Roger says the man was already dead. Antony is not sure who to believe, but he knows he's got to help Meg. What he doesn't know is that he will wind up in danger himself.A really exciting story with good characters. Not widely available, but worth reading.CMB"
1,I regret that minus stars is not an option,"A disgrace. This is a re-release of familiar material, with no information but the titles, and those are incorrect. Since it is the Pres, the musicis fine, but all of this is available in reputable releases that gives the listener personnel & dates. Makes me question my opposition to the death penalty."
4,Great Bargain,"I was looking for a printer with scan & copy functions on a college students budget. This printer fit the bill. Had no problems hooking it up on my ibook g4 until the software install, as it turns out there is a 97mb driver that needs to be downloaded to successfully install for osx. 20 mins later the printer was up and running. With the exception of the software download, I am thorougly satisfied with the 1610s functionality and performance."
1,"Buggy software, driver lost constantly","If you run Windows XP with service pack 2 you will want to run far and fast from this printer. The hardware itself is fine. The software that comes with it is a buggy mess. No newer version is available and HP doesn't seem to be able to fix the problems. The software won't uninstall and will corrupt your registry. I spent three hours manually removing all traces of it and it still won't reinstall properly. After a couple of weeks with this, I give up."
1,Worst printer on the market...,"Had pretty good luck with HP printers before, but this printer absolutely sucks. Within weeks of purchase and barely any usage, the printer started to jam. And jam. And jam again. I couldn't even spoon feed the damn thing one page at a time. Now I'm being given a color cartridge error (when I'm using an HP color cartridge), which also prevents me from using the scanner. Plus the scanning lid has already come off its hinges. It is impossible for me to conceive any more ways a printer being annoying. Every dollar spent on this printer is a dollar wasted."
4,HP PSC 1610 All-in-One,It is a great printer. Easy to install and use. The one drawback is that it does not have network drivers to be able to share it to other computers.
1,terrible product,"I bought 2 of these things to insure that I could use the same catridges. First, had to install about 6 times to get them to work, Next, one stopped scanning, Then it produced a light patch about 1 inch wide on the copy and scan functions. The other, after 6 months, printed a 1 inch wide black band on the copies and scans. Both did produce good photos from camera, but the procedures necessary seemed overly complicated, and the program for storing them on the computer was a bear to deal with, Instructions for use are almost uselss. These were the 5th and 6th printers from HP I have bought. No more, trying Canon."
3,Cheap Printer-You Get What You Pay For!,"I purchased the printer from a seller on Amazon. The seller's statements concerning the printer were extremely honest and helpful. The condition of the printer in no way reflects the seller but the manufacturer, HP. From reviewing forums on Hewett Packard's site, the printer/software had many flaws from the beginning. HP developed patches/firmware updates for some problems but the carriage/paper jams were simply addressed by instructing the consumers on how to manipulate the device to remove jams. This is a buggy printer, purchased as a back up for main device, also an HP All in One printer. Teens will have to learn to remove paper jams from the back door of device and slide the carriage from left to right to correct cartridge issues. I am not angry; I got what I paid for. If I had purchased this printer brand new, I would have walked it back to Hewett Packard!"
1,Horrible brand,"This printer continually gets paper jams. I've tried everything to stop this but I've been unable to print anything from this printer anymore due to how it grabs up the paper and twists it. How can a product like this get past the testing phase? Horrible product by a horrible brand. I will never buy an HP product again, especially a printer. Complete junk."
1,Problem Printer,"I am a long time HP printer fan and bought this one several months ago. Suddenly it keeps giving an error message ""remove and check color cartridge"". It won't print color with this message. Help from the HP web site is no help. I am not impressed."
5,Excellent performance till now!,"Hi,I am a freshman at Emory university.i bought this printer almost 2 months ago its been of a great help to me.i have already printed more than 1000 pages and still there is no problem with it.Not only me but about 10 people in my dorm have the same model and none have reported any problem till now.Its a great deal with $120.I would certainly recommend it.Qualities i think it has:1)Mind blowing picture quality2)I dont have to go to library to photocopy.3)Pretty nice color management system4)nice scanning quality."
3,Software problems!,"If you lack patience for software problems, then avoid this printer. As the other reviewers note, this printer is difficult to install. I spent countless hours on the phone with HP when trying to install the software on Windows XP (service pack 1). I was mailed a new software disk after a HP technician told me to return the item. Silly me--I re-purchased the item after I successfully installed the replacement software. A few months later, I then encountered the color cartridge problem cause by another software bug. This bug forced me to purchase a new color cartridge. I demanded a replacement cartridge from HP, which surprisingly complied. Still, HP cannot give me back all the time I wasted dealing with these annoying software problems. On a positive note, when the software behaves, the printer does indeed work nicely--it's fast, easy to use, and has many features."
3,Works great in Linux!,"I went through 2 ""supported"" Brother printers and returned them both after 1 was doa in Win and Linux, and other was doa in Linux. I loaded the HP software, plugged in the 1610 and booted. It found the scanner and set up the printer. I dual booted to WinXP and it took over an hour. This printer works great and is very quiet. I trust it will surpass the HP workhorse I retired last year."
2,Not intended for use with this machine?!,"It worked beautifully for the first couple months. Then one day, popup display started flashing an error and refused to turn off. I pulled the plug, restarted the printer, and read the new message. ""The color cartridge currently installed is not intended for use in this machine."" The problem?It was the cartridge that came with the printer.Besides being an ink devourer in the first place (and a number of issues other reviewers have described), I do not appreciate having to spend money on a new, barely used color cartridge every time my printer decides to spasm. I'll be looking for a new printer before this one drives my student budget into bankruptcy."
1,Shameful... never printed anything.,"I bought this printer with my laptop just over a year ago and I have never successfully printed anything. Unfortunately, I bought it while overseas and didn't even open it until the 1 year warranty had almost expired. I've plugged it in twice and, after several incredibly frustrating calls to the support line, have finally been told that the mechanism must not be working and I should buy a new printer... one month after the warranty expired. I was appalled by the customer service, or lack thereof, and will never again purchase an HP product for home use. If I could have given this product 0 stars, that would have been more accurate as 0 is exactly how many things I've been able to print. My recommendation would be to buy anything else... even a pen would be a more efficient printing method."
1,"Printer, Scanner, Copier","I bought a printer - scaner - copier. When I received it, it looked like it was in great shape. It was even in the original box. I went and bought ink cartridges and then tried to scan, worked great, copied, worked great, but no matter what I did I could not get it to print a picture off of my card from my digital camera. I don't know what was wrong. I informed the seller and he refunded my money."
2,"ALL IN ONE, NONE FOR ALL","It jams, it wastes, and it prints when it wants. ALL in One is none for all. Get something else. Get a fine affordable laser printer if it is for documents only, if you want something better. Avoid the all in ones. None work. Unless you move into the $500 mark."
1,Constant paper jams and problems,"This is the best example which happened to me why you shouldn't buy this printer.So recently i had to do a history project, it was about 8 papers altogether so i went to print it, the first 2 pages printed out find but then it said that the paper was jammed so i removed the paper and put it back it. It jammed up again. so i took it out and put it back in. then for some reason it prints out a picture that i printed out a few days back. so i shut it down and try printing it again and it says the ink cartridge has jammed up so i just gave up and decided to use the school's printer.Oh and this just happened a day ago i wanted to print out a picture and for some reason it slides in 4 papers instead of 1 and again it jammed up.So my advice is don't buy this go buy some higher quality one even if it's more expensive don't buy this one just trust me!"
2,Good while it works,"I like the functions on it,but as other reviewer has mentioned after awhile the color cartridge no matter how many time you replace it stops recognizing it.I paid $160.00 for this and strongly recommend not buying this unless you only need it for scanning.Hp makes great products but not this one. It was great while it lasted."
1,Won't feed paper,"After I had this printer for a few months (I use it quite rarely), it stopped feeding paper in from the paper tray. So every time I print, I have to push the sheets of paper in because it can't pull them in on its own. (And even then, it jams about half the time.) But considering how rarely I print, I haven't bothered to get a new printer yet, but I probably will when the (expensive) ink cartridge runs out."
1,Ready to throw in the trash after 2 yrs old!!!!,"I've had broblems with this printer from the start. After having it for less then a year the feeding problems accured. The paper would jam every 5 copies no matter how straight they are in the paper tray. Also, there is no way to stop a cancelled print job the computer just ques it up. Now I'm having problems with printing it prints only when it wants to. It keeps stopping the print jobs. This is the most annoying piece of junk I've ever bought I will never buy another Hewlett Packard printer again!!!!!!!"
1,"Cheap printer, outrageous ink costs","I happily ""upgraded"" to this printer when my local office/electronics store took my old printer as a small trade in for this one. What they don't tell you is that you will be buying new ink cartridges about twice as often as what you are used to, as they are about half the size of a normal ink jet cartridge, but you still pay nearly the same amount as you would for the larger ones. So it's bascially [...]: HP gets you to buy their printer as a relative low price because they know you'll spend hundreds of dollars very quickly on the ink. A secondary complaint is that it was terrible at printing onto paper of varying thickness, e.g. glossier photo paper. While HPs may be quality products in some ways, this is one customer who will never buy anything HP again after their used call salesman tactics with this printer."
1,RUN LIKE HELL !,"I really wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing this 1610 model ! What a piece of garbage ! I would get a ""paper jam"" error message without one sheet of paper in the tray ! Go figure ? Then, out of the blue, the error message ""cartridge Jammed"" would appear, again, without any paper in the machine at all. Like a possessed being, the machine would then turn itself on, and then off at various times. It got to the point where I just didn't trust it anymore in fear of it being a fire hazard in my home, so I unplugged it and said Bye_bye ! Customer support is a joke ! You can't understand a word they say, and then they get mad at you because you can't understand them ! Again, go figure ? DO NOT by this model 1610, new, or used. It's not worth the hassle, believe me !"
2,Image quality fine -- paper feeder is AWFUL!!! Get another printer...,"The printer itself is fine. Nothing exceptional about it. It's your standard, low-cost, run-of-the-mill inkjet.However, the paper feeder is AWFUL!! I spend more time trying to get the paper fed properly than I do anything else. It totally negates any worthwhile value of this printer.Do NOT buy this printer. It's not worth the headache."
1,Avoid this buggy unit!,"We bought this unit four months ago. It worked fine for three months but has been a misery for the last month. It developed some kind of software problem that HP hasn't been able to fix. As a result, I can only use the printer with great difficulty. At least HP admitted that the problem is with the unit and that a number of other buyers have had the exact same problem. Anyway, save yourself a great deal of trouble and AVOID this particular HP unit. We have never had any trouble with HP stuff before. Just this one."
2,Some bugs,"Have ALWAYS used HP printers, but this one is not up to par. After ONE week printer did not recognize print cartridge (the color one that came with it), and after cleaning, etc. had to go out and buy another brand new cartridge. The worst thing about it, if the cartridge has a problem, then you can't even scan as the printer insists on cartridge replacement. Go with a higher end model. Not recommended."
2,"Good looking, very versatile -- but doesn't last","It's a beautiful printer and quite multi-functional, which is why we decided to get four of them - one for each workplace in the studio. But I'm giving up on it. We ""lost"" now two of them in our office to unfixable paper jams and a third one just doesn't want to be configured in Mac OS X. I simply got another one the first time but this seems to be no coincidence. They are not well made and feel more disposable than the ink cartridges that it uses. I guess you get what you pay for. I am looking at a Canon at this point."
1,Junk!!,"It's never worked right, paper won't load correctly, this is just more ""cheap"" junk from HP. Do they make anything worth buying?Canon and Panasonic seem to be the best buys in most consumer electronics these days...My review is a bit late.... so no help to all you people that bought one! I am going throw this one out the 2nd floor window, onto concrete below... may film it and send it to HP."
2,Paper jams ruin an otherwise good printer,"Add me to the growing list of people who can hardly use this printer because of its incessant paper loading problems. I place a stack of paper in the tray, but the printer fails to load it, claiming it is ""out of paper."" The only way to get the printer to actually load the paper is to either A) physically push the paper into the feeder by hand, or B) only load a few pages at a time. Both options are unacceptable. The frustration I get from dealing with the paper problems ruins what would otherwise be a pleasant enough experience with a capable printer. STAY AWAY if you value your sanity!"
1,Don't buy it!,"The PSC 1610 works just fine until you suddenly and without warning get an error message on your printer screen stating ""Ink cartridge not compatible with this machine"". The first time this happened, HP sent me a new ink cartridge and instructions on downloading the ""fix"" to reprogram the computer (or printer - not sure which). No big deal except that I had no printer for about 3 weeks! Now after approximately the same time (months), the identical problem has come up and I am now told that I must pay $50 to talk to the technical expert as my warranty has expired!I would not take this printer,or any other HP printer, as a gift as I had some problems with my previous HP also!"
1,Another reason to stay away,"I have had this product a little over 30 days and overnight it quit. I have gotten 6 different error messages and the HP Tech's cannot fix it. Luckily, the store I purchased it from will take it back and refund or exchange. The HP Tech said I should be safe exchanging, but after reading all these reviews....it will be a REFUND!!! and I haven't even received any of the paper feed or print cartridge error messages. Mine are just a series of numbers that no one can explain. It's a hardware issue is all I could get out of them. I think I'll go back to Lexmark. For Pete's sake I haven't even printed a photo on this sucker......not a good deal!!! Stay away."
1,frustrating piece of junk,"I also had my 1610 only about 2 months AND rarely used it when suddenly I started getting the 'out of paper' error. I cannot even print a single page now. HP CS ultimately told me it must be a hardware issue and told me to take it to a service center. I think I'll probably just junk it and start over. Very irritating and frustrating. Shame on you, HP! If anyone knows the 'fix' for this malfunction, please enlighten the rest of us. thanks."
2,color is inconsistant&poor quality,color for printing from computer is very poor. copying a color document is uneven & not close to color on original
3,It's not bad,"I bought this printer personally from Staples, around January 2005. And I still use it today, I'm surprised it still functions like new, so the durability is amazing. It's very easy to use, but a bit complicated to install in your computer. But remember I bought this six years ago, and our technology improves everyday. I was stuck with Windows XP during 2005, so you can imagine the frustration. The one thing that brought me stress were sometimes the ink cartridges weren't recognized most of the time. And at some times they can't even detect the manufactured brands. The paper jams were hell. I'd put no less than ten and while printing it takes three along for the ride. If you were a patient person, this printer's for you. But overall, I wouldn't recommend this, spend your money on something much more modern."
1,Epic FAIL,"Lol, even though this thing is supposedly an ""All-in-One Printer, Scanner, Copier"", if you don't have both ink cartridges full this thing is completely WORTHLESS. The ""check ink cartridge"" error takes over the whole screen and locks out the whole machine altogether where you can't even scan. That's all I want to do anyways, just scan some pictures. But since I don't have a new ink cartridge to put in (I have a new printer), this thing is basically saying ""Put in a new cartridge or else...you'll never use your beloved scanner again! Hahaha!"". Uh, fine with me...I'm getting a new scanner. :P"
3,Let's get the HP PHOTOSMART 2575!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By:Nicholas Ouimet,"I tried the floor model at Staples(R) that was easy(R)!! The picture test copy was unbeleavable! It was extreamly offall. The step-up model was the hp photosmart 2575 i tried It and it was fantastic so i an saving up for it! i have herd about paper jams but i love playing with little problems unlike cartridges arrors on the psc 1610!! Plus the hp photosmart 2575 is NETWORK READY UNLIKE the PSC 1610!!So if your looking for a printer get the HP PHOTOSMART 2575 All-In-one!!I wrote this on Friday April 14,2006 at 8:17 PM"
4,Working Pretty Well So Far,"I just purchased the PSC 1610 today and so far I am pleased with it. However, I did have trouble installing it. It did not work the 1st time, so I tried it again and it worked."
1,Paper Jams and Unrecognized Color Cartridge,Within a month of owning this printer the paper would not feed any longer and indicated a paper jam. After researching this problem I found out that it is common with this printer. As I really don't do that much printing so I decided to manually feed the paper as others have suggested until the ink cartridges ran out and then just get a new printer. The problem is that this printer was affected by the other common complaint another month later in that the color print cartridge was suddenly not recognized and the printer became stuck in error mode. So I threw the printer away and am trying another brand. Save yourself the trouble and try another brand also.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALL-IN-ONE,"Two months after purchse, the machine rejected the color cartridge (model 95, the one that came in the machine). The message said ""CARTRIDGE ERROR. COLOR CARTRIDGE INSERTED IS NOT INTENDED FOR THIS MACHINE."" After an hour on the phone with HP support, he told me to buy another cartridge, which I did. The new cartridge worked fine for about a month, and then the same thing happened. This time, HP customer serivce told me the problem is in the printer (no kidding) and they are sending me a new one. It is supposed to arrive by September 28 (10 days from now). We'll see if the new one is any better."
1,Frustrating piece of garbage.,"This printer has been nothing but trouble. This is the second 1610 that I have owned. The first one worked fine for five minutes, then started up with the ""Remove and check color cartidge"" error. After I was unable to fix the problem, I returned it to the store for a new 1610, the same error occurred. The patch from HP for this specific error did nothing to correct the problem. I always heard that HP made good printers. This frustrating piece of garbage proves that wrong. Consider yourself warned."
1,Poor software - tech support useless,"I never got an opportunity to actually use this machine. I spent 6 hours trying to load the software, only to get a variety of messages about missing files, errors, etc. I spent another completely useless hour on the phone with a tech support person on a southern Asian subcontinent (to whom I assign no blame) trying various changes in settings, renaming files, etc, and still receiving the exact same error messages until I finally wrote down the case number he insisted on giving me and hanging it up for the night. I had checked all of the system requirements, including at the manufacturer's website, and my computer was well within those.The next day I bought an all-in-one machine from another manufacturer, installed it without a hitch, and am enjoying excellent results.Extremely poor job on the part of Hewlett-Packard. I wish I had listened to the customer reviews I read instead of just the editorial ones. Avoid at all costs."
5,Years old and still going!,"I have owned this item for at least 4 to 5 years. It has kept going and going and going. I have not had one problem with it. The ink cartridges are easy to replace. It troubleshoots and everything. It even prints great pictures. You can simply transfer pics and docs from just about any memory card! WOW! I love it!HP PSC 1610 All-in-One Printer, Scanner, Copier"
1,I truly hate this printer.,"I've had two HP printers in my life, and I developed a deep hatred for both of them. This one jams more often than not, doesn't load the paper properly, is very slow, and constantly gives me error messages. It refuses to scan because it didn't come with the driver or software that will do that. I waste tons of paper because it can take five or six sheets before the printer decides to print something out right. The ink cartridges are expensive, but they only last a month or two. Right now, I have to have some things printed out for tomorrow morning, and the printer has decided it doesn't like the color red and won't print anything red. I can't get new printer cartridges because nothing is open.Do not buy this printer. You will regret it."
1,I will never buy an HP printer again,"Between the constant paper jams, inability to use ink cartridges other than the grossly overpriced HP, and ridiculously slow printing times on the rare occasions when it does work, I wish I had never bought this piece of crap, and I paid less than half of what they're asking for it here at Best Buy.Do not buy this piece of crap. Not even used. It will piss you off to no end."
2,"Good, Bad, and Ugly","My new one was ""broken"" out of the box; a screw that was set incorrectly caused the print head to jam. I purchased mine from Staples; they immediately gave me a new one, no questions asked! Mine was the first one that had been brought back to them (at that time).I, too, had the paper-jam problems, difficulty with the paper feed, inability to place more than four sheets of paper in the bin at once, etc., but now that problem isn't so big because the plastic part that slides to adjust for paper size broke and I can't use it at all. Very disappointed here; it prints clearly and fast when it works. I just wish it worked reliably and smoothly. My dad had the same problems with his new HP in another state; he bought his from Office Max and they replaced it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,Have had nothing but problems with the printer. It constant jams and the paper misfeeds every single time. Unless you want to manually feed each and every sheet then avoid this printer. Just terrible.
2,Good Start Poor ending,"I bought this printer December 15, 2006. It has a one year warranty, however the envelope and paper feed are giving me some fits. The warranty ran out one month ago and now the machine has these problems.I think HP is TIMELY on their warranty.Good luck on yours."
4,Good Buy,"My father purchased this machine as a refurbished unit from a big box retailer and has enjoyed using it so far. It performs all of its functions as expected. Also, he uses XP and has had no software problems at all after several months of use."
4,So Far So Good,"Purchased 1/23/06. The installation was flawless. I took other owners' advice and followed the instructions to a ""T"". I have only tried printing and copying. Everything worked and looked great.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's an HP. My previous HP (PSC1350) lasted less than two years with light use. A paper jam caused the ink cartridge carriage to go beserk (slamming violently side to side). HP customer service was no help. I'm giving HP one more try.For the price though, I don't think it can be beat."
5,Church stories,"Anecdotes about Methodists, Methodist pastors, and Methodist churches from across western North Carolina. Would that every church had a ""story historian"" like Lee Tuttle!"
1,HUGE disappointment,"This print server came with sketchy instructions and took many hours to set up. I eventually got it working with 2 printers for about 1 month. Then it went kaput. I cannot get the thing to work now (and I didn't change a thing re: configuration). I spent hours on the phone on hold for customer service and the only live person I did speak with couldn't help me. This sucks and I'm returning it. In contrast, I have a Linksys wireless router and am extremely pleased."
5,Working great!,"We replaced a Netgear Print Server which I hated. I was glad to see it go after an upgrade from the Netgear website killed it. Thanks Netgear upgrade guys, I was ready to throw it out the window anyway.This D-Link product worked right out of the box, the hardest part was plugging in the cables. The LEDs are a little small and dim but who cares, it works perfect and you don't have to see the LEDs. Highly recommended."
5,Works Perfectly,"This device worked within 10 minutes of opening the box. I changed network settings to match my home setup using supplied instructions and added an admin password. Moments later documents were printing. I'm using it with an old but still highly reliable HP Laserjet 5P. The DP-300U replaces an old Linux print server (Samba) that used to stall occasionally, especially when printing driving directions when I was running late to a meeting. An appliance solution is sooo much less hassle - and this is coming from an IT person."
2,Make sure of compatibility,"Before you buy this, go to D-Link's website and ensure compatibility. If it isn't there, you're buying a dog. This might be a very good print server, but didn't make my Lexmark printer budge.Customer support takes a long time also."
5,works with Linux!!,The DP-300U works great with Linux and Windows. I have two Linux computers and two Windows computers and they all print to the two printers connected to this unit. I just used a browser to configure the unit and set up the computers to print to it. On Linux I used the lpd configuration and it works perfectly! I am very happy with the unit.
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!!,"There are two major problems with this print server. The first is that you HAVE to check to see if your printer is on the VERY SHORT DLink compatibility list. If yours isn't there, then you're out of luck. The second problem is that the device comes with a fixed IP address, which means you lose access to your router unless it happens to be on the exact same IP address.In my case, I finally got the device to print, but I lost my Internet connection. I could restore my internet connection but then I would lose access to the printer. I read that there is a work around for this, but I've never had to spend so much time setting up a device."
5,iPod - The Best Gadget EVER,"I bought the iPod after months of anticipation. I was afraid that I was expecting so much I would end up being dissapointed. When i finally bought it, I could not believe it. It was better than I expected. I installed the program (MusicMatch Jukebox for Windows) and I was ripping CDs onto it in no time. One feature I really enjoy is the ""On The Go"" playlist. You can easily scroll through all your songs and add them to this temporary playlist so you can listen to whatever songs you want to on the go. Another thing I didn't realize about it was the buttons are touch sensative. You just tap them, or in the case of the wheel you just spin your finger around it. Nothing moves! I HIGHLY reccomend this product to students, business owners...anyone who loves music."
3,PC Users Beware,"I am an experienced technology user (20 years in the industry) and had one of the worst experiences ever with this product. The iPod itself is nice, but is not ready for primetime with the PC. If you have a Mac, go forth and prosper, but if you have a PC beware that the software is at best pre-alpha quality and that the device has a design flaw for PC users (that it gets power only through certain 6-pin firewire ports, which most PCs don't have).Anway, why would you really want to buy an iPod when you can get a 60Gb Nomad Zen for $$$$ less than a 30Gb iPod? (Unless you just have to have product packaging that looks like a wedding invitation.)"
4,Good,"Well this product has all the features of the 10, 15, and 20 Gig iPod but 7500 songs? get the 10 gig. Cheaper, with all of th same features but 2500 songs. thats more than enough for half the price. I suggest the 10 gig because if you have over 2500 songs to put on it- thats crazy. Wise buying move take it from experience."
3,"Beware ""The Gap""","The iPod is an amazing portable electronic device with a very annoying problem known as ""The Gap"" - a silent pause between music every track. Can you imagine listening to The Beatles ""Sgt. Pepper"" or Queens of the Stone Age ""Songs For The Deaf"" with pauses between the seamlessly mixed tracks? No serious music lover will be able to ignore what the iPod does to their favorite music. Apple has a serious issue to resolve if it expects its download music service to replace CD's. I refuse to purchase any dowloaded albums knowing I may not be hearing what the artist originally intended. Beware ""The Gap""! I cannot give the iPod more than three stars without a fix for this bug. However, my review would easily jump to 4 1/2 stars if ""The Gap"" didn't exist."
5,Best piece of hardware ever created and it is [inexpensive],"This is my third iPod and first I would like to say, that I never have been that satisfied about any purchase I made for my whole life. Features, compatibility, sound quality design, production quality and added extras make the rest of its competitors look pretty poor (and not only on the outside). It stands alone atop of a hill, where the others dig into the ground down in the valleys.Taking in account what you actually get for your money, the new 30 GB iPod is quiet [inexpensive]. I am thinking about getting a second one for my collection to leave it unpacked as a milestone in consumer electronics. Oh by the way. My battery lasts longer than with the older models. But perheaps they assemble a better battery for the European market. At least it is more expensive than in the US. This could be the reason why.Anyway, who doesn't buy this one should be punished for wasting his money."
5,Don't listen to some of the PC nonsense being put out,"I read one review that said Music Match Plus would only work with a Dell etc. This is complete nonsense. I use it on a Gateway, my buddy uses it on an eMachines. I have a new 30 GB iPod, he has an older 20 GB. I have Win 2K, he has XP Home. It works fine. As far as the synching, I read one review that said it didn't work etc. Also bogus. The synching works fine. I transferred 15 GB's over night and it went well. Maybe I'll find some bugs down the road but so far so good. Don't let bad info scare you off. I sent an e-mail to MusicMatch tech support and got a response the next day. I followed up with a clarification and got a response from the same tech a day later. Believe me, that beats the heck of HP tech support. So enjoy!"
1,Amazon and iPod fail the test for this PC user.,"I am very discouraged and dissapointed.I did not get everything I needed to make this device work, and after 3 trips to the store and an additional $350 I'm not sure I will ever be able to use the iPod.Seems like a great little device but maybe it will only satisfy an Apple owner. I am simply not able to make it work.If you are considering this item, BE CAREFUL."
1,Problems,"Freezes and crashes even after re-installing the software. Apple says they will ""fix"" but will not refund or replace it."
1,Machine Konked out and Apple says TOO BAD,"I bought the IPOD in good faith. I didn't realize, and still don't understand why there is only a 10 day return policy.I would not have bought it if I had known that.It died during a sync. Have no idea why, but it did. I sent it back for repairs, and they claim nothing is wrong with it.But, they can't get it to move off of the FOLDER warning menu. So, I can't use it. Tech support wants me to send it back for the second time.No refunds. No exchanges."
2,iPod doesn't match up,"Although the iPod itself has decent features and capacity, price-wise it is junk. For $100 less, you can purchase Creative's Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 30GB, or even cheaper still the NX version. iPod will get teh job done, but Nomad has a bit better features, adaptability, and BETTER sound quality. When you couple this with the MASSIVE price gap, you have a real winner (Nomad) and a real loser, (iPod). If you want to spend $400 that badly, get the 60GB Nomad Zen Xtra (availible here on Amazon). Oh wait... its still not even $400, so I guess you can keep the extra cash, along with twice the harddrive space you would have had with iPod."
2,did not work with Windows,"I had a very hard time getting the iPod to work with Windows XP even with the USB wire they recommended I bought with it. After trying for 6 hours to get it to play or download or anything I gave up, boxed it up and will be returning it. Thats too bad because I was really looking forward to owning one. Do I need to buy a Mac for the iPod to actually work??"
3,not so bad,"not so bad, good amount of memory, fair battery, decent sound. overall a-okay. problems: battery (not replaceable) & loses charge overtime. Go here for a free 20Gb ipod:http://www.tech4free.com/default.aspx?ref=117793"
3,28021EE1,"Phone is large enough to not feel like you are talking into a cell phone, but the numbers stored in memory are not alphabetized. The caller ID often displays ""Incomplete Data"" instead of showing the number calling while the other phones in the house are able to show the caller information. Definitely better phones out there."
2,Don't buy,"I bought two of this, but both came with batteries bad, good volume but bad product, with this experience this was my last time to buy GE wireless phones."
2,Only if you like Windows,"I got the bright idea to try and install this in a Linux machine and so far have had no luck. I'm beginning to suspect that I'll have to rip it back out and put in my Windows box.P.S.: It was missing the audio cable, but I wasn't planning to use it anyway."
3,Dazzling Performances,"While clearly, this is not the greatest of musicals and it doesn't pretend to be, it is an oppurtunity to hear several incredible, powerhouse performances. Yes, Hugh Jackman is amazing as Peter Allen, without trying to copy him at all. But, the other performers keep up with him. Isabell Keating is unbelievable as Judy Garland. She DOES copy Garland, in singing, mannerisms and looks and she is wonderful. Jarod Emmick, as always, is fantastic. One of the best voices on Broadway.The entire score is Peter Allen's and Jackman makes the most of every song. A great CD for Allen, Jackman or musical theater fans."
4,New King of Broadway,"I had the supreme pleasure of seeing Jackman in this role last year. While the show itself was mediocre due to a subpar script, Jackman's performance rates an A+. From the moment he walked on stage, he had the audience completely enthralled. He sang brilliantly, he danced flamboyantly (like Mr. Allen), and, best of all, he ACTED the clunky dialogue so well, the author should thank his lucky stars! Jackman's renditions of Peter Allen's pop songs are filled to the brim with the joy of performing. I have listened to this CD over 100 times, and it still delivers the tears and laughter I experienced at the live show. Bravo, Mr. Jackman! Please hurry back to Broadway!"
3,Boy from Oz,I love Hugh Jackman and I mistakenly thought that I was purchasing a DVD of the play. I was a bit disappointed to find it was a CD of the songs from the play. It appears to be a fine reproduction of the numbers sung.
3,"Not The Best Singing, But A Decent Buy","While Hugh Jackman is a terrific entertainer, & clearly carried the somewhat successful ""Boy From Oz"" to profitablity, singing is not his strongest point. And, unfortunately, Mr. Jackman sings most of the songs in this show.The original cast album to this production is not bad, but will not blow you away by any means. Best tracks include:The Lives Of MeShe Loves To Hear The MusicBi-CoastalMostly for Mr. Jackman fans or a show souvenir!"
4,I agree with Mr. Lopez' review COMPLETEY!,"Hugh Jackman's live performance cannot be missed. He'll be moving back to Australia in September, so hurry everybody!! Isabel and Stephanie do an admirable job of imitating Liza and Judy, but Hugh is pure Hugh. I loved the performances, while disliking the songs themselves. It is hard to explain unless you see the show in person...Once I saw the show, I really enjoyed the CD because I could envision the electric performances I saw last week on my trip to NYC:)I wish Hugh would add records to his list of accomplishments!!"
4,Wow!!,"I just saw the show last night and I was left speechless! Hugh Jackman is truly a superstar!! His performance is one of the greatest that I have ever seen on the Great White Way. He sings, he dances, he flirts, he improvises...on and on. It was an amazing experience to behold. The rest of the cast was wonderful but it's clear who is the star here.The CD does a commendable job in preserving the the great performance of Jackman. One really has to see the show, however, to get the full effect. Peter Allen would have been pleased by Jackman and the production."
5,LOVED IT!,I thoroughly enjoy my Avenue Q cd. The music is fun and exhilerating. Hugh Jackman is trully a great performer- there is no x man in sight here. I can't wait tog go to New York and see this!Other CDs I recommend:Avenue QSweeney Todd- my FavoriteHairsprayLittle Shop of Horrors- the movie still rocksLa Traviata- the best operaThe Boy from OZandVoice Lessons To Go (both volumes)- So you can learn how to sing with all of the performers!
1,An absolute insult to the artistry of Peter Allen,"I listened to this album one, long, painful time through and never opened it again. Jackman, while possibly a good showman is a mediocre vocalist. His interpretations of Allen's work sink one great song after another into boredom, and at times, the songs are barely recognizable. The Garland and Minelli sound-alikes don't, as their performances are raspy and strained. I found the soundtrack to be unlistenable."
2,Proof Broadway is Sinking,"Broadway Producers are getting so desperate for a hit, they'll do anything. Stephanie Block delivers the only decent number with ""Love to Hear the Music"", but one song doesn't justify this horror.Who told Hugh Jackman he could sing?No, seriously, I want to meet the person sitting behing the casting desk who said to themselves, ""That's him! That's the man that will carry this entire show and blow people away with his powerhouse vocals!""They need a good punch in the face.Jarrod Emmick (Rocky Horror Show) is wasted here in a thankless role, when in reality, he's the only one that can sing.Don't get me wrong... I'm sure the poor women doing the bad impersonations of Judy and Liza are really quite good, but their over-the-top attempts at capturing their characters is so distracting it's hard to think of much else."
5,Dog likes it!,"Our dog has arthritis in her neck (just like her mommy).I don't know if copper works or if it's just an old wives tale or urban myth, but it can't hurt. Maybe i should get one for myself.. woof!It looks pretty on her. The neighbor kids even said so!And being a jewelry-hobbyist, i can say it's not a bad price for a hunk of chopper chain that could be converted easily into a bracelet for humans.Woof!"
2,Partially useful,"I found this book helpful for defining the framework for components: a very useful taxonomy for the Component Based Development. Chapter 2 is far the most interesting, the rest of the book worth very little.At the time of MDA and code generation most of this book is soon becoming obsolete. Some concepts are just fancy re-definitions of terms that add no value to book. You will not able to put this concepts in practices, there is more a vision in this book rather then enabling a reader to ""kick its wheels"" for starting an effective CBD project. Beside all it lacks examples, those given are overs simplified and they mislead the reality of what's outside there. I'm asking myself how many enterprise projects the main author has put into production before this book was published.In general I'd suggest downloading the Chapter 2 which is freely available from the same authors, you save money and still get the most important concepts."
5,What a lovely voice.,"I love Gerard Joling (from Holland) ever since I heard his first song ""Love is in your eyes"" back in 1985. I am fortunate enough to have collected almost all of his albums on CD. He has great voice and listening him sings christmas songs is even better. Listen to this and you won't be sorry. After buying this, you will go and search for his other albums on cd. Not an easy find but they are out there."
5,A terrific present for young dinosaur enthusiasts,"I sent this to my 5 year old nephew, who recently transitioned from the usual early interest in trucks and planes into a fascination with dinosaurs. Since receiving it, he has been reading it constantly. His parents are happy that he is reading more on his own, and tell me that the illustrations are good. The book covers many dinosaurs that aren't discussed in other books. I am thrilled that my nephew is learning to read and developing a interest in learning on his own."
4,Not quite 5 stars,This book is great. The illustriations are remarkable and realistic. The reason it didn't get five stars is because it does not list the Spinosaurus. Which is my 4 year old's favorite. Buy it and enjoy
5,Great cinnamon sticks,These cinnamon sticks are very good! They are very potent and far better than any I've gotten from the local grocery store.
3,I did not care too much about it,"Again, a great idea.......However, I did not feel any real connection between the main characters, and writing was a little choppy."
2,Blech!,"Sooo boring. Camilla was such a materialistic, power hungry woman that I found it hard to like her. The author threw in some charitable deeds to balance things out but she came up very short. It didn't help that she accomplished these deeds with someone else's money. In contrast, Archie was just a little to perfect. He was so syrupy sweet that it became uncomfortable. Grovel, grovel. A little bit of conflict between the two would have been quite refreshing.Well written? Yes. Enjoyable? Not for me."
3,Not bad...,"Considering I've never been a fan of Heath I was surprised that I actually liked this one. It wasn't great...but it wasn't a total waste either. The characters were very real (I really enjoyed getting to know them), but the story was run of the mill common and very predictable. I'm pretty sure that if you're a fan of this author you'll enjoy this book."
3,"Charming, But a Little Vapid","This book is an enjoyable piece of ""fluff."" I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because while it's a sweet tale of love and romance, the story itself lacked depth and intrigue, in my opinion. It's like biting into a cream puff and finding yourself with a mouthful of too much sugar and not enough substance to chew on. I felt the characters could have been developed a little more thoroughly, and the feelings between them could have been slightly deeper. It's still a good afternoon read by the pool or in front of the fireplace, though."
5,As an Earl Desires,"I didn't think I'd completely like Camilla at first, but I grew to understand her and loved their relationship. Archie was a wonderful hero. This was only my second Lorraine Health book, and I'm so eager to read more. She's not in my library so I have to order her books."
1,"Great Comics, Bad Price",It is a lot cheaper if you buy each book seperatly off Amazon. I paid around ninety for all seven with free shipping.
4,Almost Perfect,"There is no other way to describe sin city other than perfect. The books themselves warrant a full five stars, yet the lack of an enclosure makes the books harder to store. Amazon needs to include a holder so people dont have to spend the 180 neccessary for both hardcover packs."
5,Frank Miller is amazing!!,"I loved the movie ""Sin City,"" but I wanted more, so I went ahead and bought the entire graphic novel set. I have to say that it was a great decision. I can hardly put it down. The artwork is amazing, the stories are engaging and its is definitely worth it!"
3,"Good idea, poor reception","I was happy to read of the activities undertaken by this man had some success, but as too typical of such projects - few doing, rest 'riding' on efforts. And while its a rather interesting contrast between free individual efforts undertaken in (free choice) group situations, the book is a potentially inspiring 'guide' of sorts. Not a bad book to hold onto for future reference just in case of collapse and re-start."
3,$12.99 for bugs bugs bugs,"Bees, butterflies on every vinyl and cork coaster.The designs are better than plastic tablecloth from Woolworth's. It's not as grandma as I feared. I don't know why the packaging is mentioned in the product description. They are packed in an open sided cardboard box and sealed in plastic. The packages were packed in styrofoam peanuts and a plain brown cardboard box.Made in China"
5,Awesome books,This is an awesome set of books. All of them are. It's good to start with Level 1 in pre-school before or in Kindergarden. My daughter has not finished Kindergarden and is reading Level 3. I highly recommend these.
4,great series for new readers,"Great for blossoming readers. My kindergartener is really enjoying these funny short books. He loves seeing what happens next as he sounds out new words. My only complaint is that in this series as well as the level 3 the font isn't appropriate for new readers. The ""g"" is cursive looking & is very confusing. Don't know why that changed from the pre-readers & level 1&2, disappointing."
5,Pleasant Memories and Smiles of Remembrance,"Relax in your favorite chair. Grab a box of tissue and let Pat Brannon take you to a world of pleasant memories and smiles of remembrance as she draws out people, places, and events of your life while sharing some of her own with you. She reaches down into those secret places in your heart and soul and shakes up your emotions. Everyone can relate to the experiences expressed here from the joy of birth to the crushing loss of death and all of life in between. Your heart will soften and you will be different after having laughed and cried through this book as you remember your own special times and quietly say, ""Yeah, that's what I feel, too."""
3,Rice Schmice...,"The color is great for highlighting but doesn't work that well on me. It's as described but for my taste is a little too bright as a brow lighter. I usually use a gold brow pencil that I blend so maybe I'm partial to that preference. Good product overall, but not my favorite."
4,A solid debut...,"I first heard and listened to SS with their second album Pitch Black Progress (which rocks). I like their newer stuff so much that I bought this one. It is a solid debut, but unless you love their second album, you probably won't like this one a whole lot. The vocals are a little too unpolished for me (both the clean and growls). Musically, this album does showcase the enormous progressive metal potential they have. All in all I think they are a great band to support, and look forward to their 3rd album."
4,really good stuff,"hard and heavy, melodic, catchy...highly recommendedgood mix of death and melodic metal. buy it!"
5,Brillant treatment of nonlinear differential and integral equations,"This book contains a superb treatment of the classical theories of nonlinear equations including integral equations of the Volterra type. It was written in 1960, when the use of computers to solve differential equations and dynamical systems was in its infancy and the book is of course dated in this aspect. However, the book is a true treasure and is worth reading for its thorough and comprehensive treatment, including an introduction to the concept and usefulness of the phase space. It is bad that it is hard to get nowadays, but it is worth trying to get it used."
5,Nonlinear Differential Equations,"Excellent coverage of the Painleve nonlinear differential equations.Excellent presentation of the method of Continuous Analytic Continuation and its use to numerically advance the solution of nonlinear equations in the complex domain around poles that can occur in the real domain, such as those that arise with the Painleve equations."
5,Must Have If You Live or Visit FLs Gulf Coast Beaches,I found this book in my library's reference section and just had to have a copy. Find out the TRUTH about Jose Gaspar! Find out how Treasure Island got its name! Meet the characters that settled the Gulf Coast Beaches. It is an entertaining and informative book that should be in your personal library.
1,CONGRATULATIONS RHINOPLASTY,"HERES ANOTHER 60S BAND RHINO HANDMADE HAS PRICED OUT OF THE RANGE OF MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT SUPPORT THIS BAND AND PUT THEM IN THE CHARTS...IT GOES ON AND ON..PREMEDITATED GREED AND VERY POOR MARKETING..I HAVE ALL THE LPS AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS GROUP ON CD, BUT IM NOT BILL GATES..IF YOU BUY THIS, LET ME SELL YOU SOME STOCKS AND BONDS...IF THIS IS NOT STOPPED YOU WILL BE LOOKING AT 500 DOLLAR CDS...WHAT?..ITS ALREADY HERE?..BUY THE LPS FOR 5 DOLLARS..DONT SUPPORT THIS ROBBERY....BRITMAN 46"
3,Fun but not that fun,"Spin and Trap was a game we'd seen at our local educational toy shop. My son asked for it for Christmas and we ordered it. It's a very well made and sturdy game. However, the fun value is not very high. You spin the marbles and try to get your color of marbles to surround a green marble and then you've ""captured"" it. Once you've captured two green marbles you've won. We've played it a few times but having recieved other games for Christmas that were really, really fun...this game has sort of gone by the wayside already."
3,Biss is not bliss,"My wife and I heard Jonathan Biss recently perform with The Cleveland Orchestra. We thought his performance was outstanding. Thus my desire to purchase this CD. I am disappointed, however, with the CD. Good, but not extraordinary. Too much pedal, runs not precise in some cases. I would think he and his agent would not want to muddy his image by distributing performances that are not as good as he can be."
1,its over,"you can kinda take a hunch that hardcore music is over when they make cd's like this.but reviews like that last guy just plain spits it in your face that hardcore is OVER.taking back sunday, thursday, afi, story of the year, all theseare no less mainstream then nickleback and good charolette.they stand for nothing and do not know how to produce anythingbesides heartbreak and music. god this stevin allen guy is an idiot. REAL hardcore punk i dont think is even around anymore,it colided with metal and pop, and became crap.you want real hardcore, go look up some final exit, dead and gone, saetia, or even refused. they have a real message that applys to everyone, and isnt just selfish little new age emo lyrics.god, punk just needs to die... every shape and form.""without substance and with useless banners, your art is worth nothing"""
3,Old Hollywood,"Many of the interviews are fascinating. As for the rest of the book, the prose is workmanlike. But fans of early Hollywood will be pleased."
2,A Low Point,"""The Twelve Tasks of Asterix"", for me personally, was a low point in the Asterix series. This is a story book, and not a graphic story like the others. So, if you are really looking for the graphic books, then don't buy this one.The story is mildly entertaining, but hardly up to the same standards of the comics. Without the graphics, some of the humour is lost, such as the expressions and other details that make the comics so endearing.Except for the most fanatical and hardcore Asterix fans, approach ""The Twelve Tasks"" with caution."
2,Poor writing hurts this,"An autobiography of Matty Lee. He had an alcoholic father and a distant mother. He ran away and became a child of streets involving prostitution and drugs. Some of the events are powerful and harrowing but--more often than not--I was lost. You never get a sense of how old he was, when he ran away or HOW he ran away. Constantly through the book he backtracks to show us characters and events that should have been introduced earlier. The gaps in the story and some truly poor writing make this a chore to read. Yes it IS powerful but this needed a good editor."
4,Brass Easel,This easel looks great but it simply doesn't stay together. I have had to replace several nuts and bolts and the easel has only been used a few times = the thing just won't stay together.
1,Don't Bother to Buy,"I ordered this bed and am returning it immediately. What the profile doesn't say about the bed is that you cannot keep the bed plugged in when not in use. Who has time to run around unplugging the thing as your cat hops in and out of it? I bought the K&H heated kitty bed three years ago and it just died, so was hoping for a longer operating bed. But I would rather have a bed that I can keep plugged in (and turns on only when she is in it) than one I have to keep an eye on."
5,Great product!,"I purchased the medium size blue Pet bed for my 15 1/2 year old Shih Tzu who was shaky and cold at night in our bedroom. He absolutely loves it! He sleeps soundly through the night- no more getting up and pacing at night, and I have to pry him out of it in the morning to take him outside before I got to work. I have noticed he also doesn't seem as stiff when he wakes up. I feel the price was also great. I probably could have used the small, because the medium could fit 2 of him in it- It does not get warm to the touch, it just holds his body heat in somehow. I would recommend to anyone with a pet that needs a little warmth."
5,The Wellness Sleeper for cats,"I bought a number of these and ALL, including this one, are wonderful for Montana cold winter weather. My cats are in the garage in the winter and they both sleep in one ""welness sleeper"" to stay warm."
1,died way too young,"I used this for only two winters before it stopped heating. That is only 6 months of use, with careful storage during the summer months. So, not covered by warranty. Talked to PetSafe and they told me this size and model lists for 24.99, so I'm wondering why it was listed here for 69.99 ?"
5,Heated bed for Taffy,I had one of these and the heater quit working and my old girl loved it so much I knew I had to get her another one. The bed is very nice and even gets warmer that the old one did. My little Taffy she loves it. Thanks so much
5,A real comfort to my cats,"This has proved to be a nice investment (although the price is extremely reasonable). I have 3 cats, and 2 of them are ""cat bed"" sleepers. Both of them enjoy taking turns sleeping in this heated bed, especially the older of the two. I purchased the Small size, which is perfect for my cats (all are around 9 lbs.) and would be fine for even larger cats. The heat feels ""barely there"", but to sleep on it, this is probably the perfect temperature as you wouldn't want it hot or even too warm. I keep mine plugged in all of the time. The quality of the materials is excellent and it feels very well made. Bottom line, I highly recommend it if you have a pet that you already know will sleep in a pet bed."
2,heated wellness sleeper not very warm,"The bed does not get very warm at all. I feel my toy poodle is still cold when she uses it. I would skip it,if given the chance."
3,As Advertised,"The Petsafe Heated Wellness Sleeper is exactly as advertised. Unfortunately neither of my dogs will use when plugged in. At ages 12 & 13, I thought this would be an ideal Christmas gift for them but evidently not. Occasionally one will lay with her butt against the outside of it when its plugged in but that's it. They don't use it when it's not plugged in either. I think the bottom padding may be too thin. What a disappointment.I recently added a new pad from another dog bed on top of the bed and I found my dog curled up in the bed. That probably defeats the purpose of the heated bed but now I know what the problem is."
5,My Cat Loves It,"We purchased this for our cat, and she loves it. The heat is a very low heat, but it keeps her warm at night when we turn down the heat in our house. The extra small is a perfect size for a small to medium sized cat. My only complaint so far is that I would love to see an on/off switch near the bed. You have to unplug it whenever you want to turn the heat off. But otherwise, an overall good product."
5,Great for Boats,"I got this bed for my 10-lb chihuahua mix to use on our sailboat. She has a smooth coat, doesn't have much fur on her underside, and hates to wear her sweater to bed. It gets very cold at night on the boat even with a heater on and I was afraid such a small dog would get too chilled. She loves the heated bed. The first night she hopped right in and didn't want to come out the next morning. I did put a little fleece blanket down first so I won't have to wash the bed cover as often but that didn't seem to diminish the heat effect. Since I cover over the top of the bed with another blanket, the heat is retained better within the little ""den."" I can see where this would also be a great bed for mountain cabins or any cold environment."
2,Burnt My Carpet,"Bought this for my JRT for Christmas, and kept it plugged in overnight for him to use. My dog seems to enjoy it, but one major problem, it burnt my Berber carpeting. Now my dog has to use it solely as an unheated dog bed."
4,"Works nice for smaller dog, I modified it automotive use.","Low current draw, produces heat but doesn't get hot. I found a cigarette adapter that had the correct plug for the bed and use it in a vehicle during winter to keep a dog warm. Again it's not real warm but it does take the chill off."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Bed is nice,soft and very large. Great for my two small dogs. The heater worked for about 15 minutes and the bed never got warm again. I tried it in drifferent plugs, but the element must have gone out right away. I spent almost $100 for fluff. Save your mmoney on this one."
2,Bed was a dud!,"Ordered this bed for my cold-natured chihuahua. Received bed, followed operating instructions, bed never heated up enough to feel. Returned product."
3,"Great bed, but the detachable cord is not very ""chew-resistant.""","This bed is great, and my 5-month old Shiba Inu puppy, Goomba, really loves to lounge around in it. The only problem we've had is that I left him alone for about two minutes and came back to find that he had chewed several portions of the cord, exposing the copper wire beneath. I've contacted PetSafe, and I hope they can resolve this. Like I said, the bed itself is terrific. The egg-crate design of the mattress looks super comfy, but I'm just concerned about the reliability of the cord's ""chew-resistant"" claims."
5,Kitty Heaven,"My 19 year old cat has arthritis and was always looking for the warmest spot in the house...now she has her own personal warm spot with this heated bed. She spends far more time in it than in her previous comfy, but unheated, bed. It stays plugged in all the time (except when we are out of the house for days at a time.) I took it to the kennel last time we were out of town and she was in it a great deal of the time. I shopped the local pet shops including the big box stores and this price beat anything I saw locally. Quality is perfect, price is right, free Prime shipping...what could be bad?"
2,mediocre pet bed 2 1/2 stars,"Well the cats will lay in it on occasions, but it is far from plush, and far from warm, and I had to use split loom tubing to protect the very thin and quite chewable power cord. The #1 use the kittens have for this is a cusioned landing pad to use when they jump from high on their cat tree.If you really need extra heat for your pet and a comfy place to sleep, buy a nice soft $20 pet bed and install some form of auxillary heating in the area."
3,"Not as good as I expected, but good enough I guess.","I got this for my pug/min-pin who has basically 0 body fat. It warms up slightly...but honestly, it would have been just as good to get him a blanket and a pillow. And that would have been cheaper."
1,Heated cat bed that no one will use!,"Save your money! I have three cats and one dog, and no one will use this bed. This bed puts out very little heat. It might work well if you used it out in the cold garage, but in the house, my furniture seems to be far more inviting than this bed."
5,Dog Bed,"Love this bed. We threw her old bed out, she then moved to the couch or the bed. Now she has her own bed and when she's ready for bed this is where she goes."
5,petsafe heated dog bed,"Excellent value. Our yorkshire terrier loves his new bed. He sleeps in it every night. It does keep him warm, but we had to put a blanket on top of it so he wouldn't get too hot. now it's just right."
3,"Dog doesn't like it, but the cat does....","I bought this for my arthritic old dog, but she only stays in it if I make her, she much prefers her $20.00 Costco dog bed. It's a little small for her, she's too crippled to move around easily to fit it to her, and the foam is thin and not nearly as comfy as the other beds I have for the dogs. It is ""Large"" but smaller than standard Costco beds. It's flimsy which makes it soft enough around the bolster to let her put her front feet over, but apparently that's not comfortable enough because she gets up and leaves if she lands in that position. Twice I've seen her lie down with her head and hips all inside, but that doesn't last long either. I'll keep it for the cats, although it's much too big; it's just too big a pain to return.If I had it to do again, I'd look for a hunting dog bed, I think they're more like the costco round bed, but with heat."
2,Too Little Heat,"Bought the heated bed for my 17 year old cat who loves sleeping in warm places. This unit doesn't put out enough heat to interest her, it barely felt warm to my hand. She will only use it when I put an electic heating pad, set on low, in the sleeper under a towel. I could have done the same with a cheaper non heated unit."
2,"Nice bed, terrible heater.",I have two tea cup chihuahua's and in the winter they get very cold so I bought this bed. I could barely tell a difference between the room temperature and the bed (our home is kept at 75 degrees). They were constantly shivering - and they wear sweaters in the winter. So now I am looking for a new bed that will keep them warm through the winter.
2,Dog Loved It,"I ordered this bed for my SharPei who has a little arthritis. He loved the warmth and looked forward to bed time all night. After the cover became soiled, I unzipped and removed it, washed it and replaced it. In the process, as I was replacing it, the zipper stripped. Now the bottom is just hanging loose. When I plugged the bed back in, the heating element did not work.Now the dog has a comfortable, but cold, bed.This was a great product and my dog loved it, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired."
5,Great Invention,"My 15 lb Ragdoll cat found the bed within an hour of putting it out. He's in and out of it throughout the day. To my relief, he seems to have taken to it quite well. We want to start taking him with us on overnight trips and this is a perfect travel bed for him. The small size is still a little large for him, but should be perfect when he reaches his 20 lb projected size. For now, I just fill in the space with a towel rolled lengthwise around the inside perimeter."
3,Bad Sizing,"This bed is too small for our 18 lb dog, and the next size up is huge! This would be a great product if it were made in a size in-between."
1,Don't waste your money,"My dog is disabled and we got this bed thinking the heat would help her when she sleeps and we are working. The bed is not soft, rather hard wavy on the bottom and it does not heat hardly at all, not even enough to really feel it not to mention helping an animal laying on it. I thought it was just my dog but my son's two dogs and my other two dogs won't go near it either. What a waste of money for the price."
1,PETSAFE HEATED WELLNESS SLEEPER,The bed did not heat properly. Only one small section was warm so my pet had to scrunch up in one little corner.
1,"save your money - no heat, cover doesn't come off.","This is a very comfortable bed. The dogs love it, second only to the sofa.However, it does NOT get warm; though the cord gets super hot. It is also impossible to take off the cover. It has a nice, long zipper, but the cover is grommetted to the cord and foam. You would have to rip the cover to get it off. So now I have a $75 stinky, cold bed. NICE.Go spend $40 at WalMart."
5,great book,This is a grat book to use for scrabble and a game we have learned how to play called Quiddler.
4,Prompt shipping - bad instructions,"The instructions sent by Discount Keyless involved removing the drawer below the radio and putting jumpers on a connector to the keyless entry module. The description of the plugs and wires did not match my car in the least so after removing the drawer, I couldn't even start the steps to program the remote. I went online and found the following incantation which did the trick:[...]Strangely, Discount Wireless has no website or email address (they do have a phone number, but today's a holiday weekend) so I can't alert them that their instructions are incorrect. Hopefully they'll see this review and send future customers the proper instructions with this remote."
5,Invite Home the Power of the Irish Feminine,"This book should not be out of print, furthermore, every Irish descendant should read it. The Serpent and the Goddess is an in-depth exploration of the demise of the feminine in Ireland by a Romanized and patriarchal Christian tradition. Condren pulls no punches and she probably could have thrown a few more. The hopeful aire to the book is the fact that the Irish feminine has not disappeared, and her piece by piece, step by step mapping of the suppression of the feminine in the Celtic traditions is done in such a manner to almost offer a prophetic vision of her return, within both primal, druidic as well as in Celtic Christian ways."
4,The World Of Drow,Pretty good start to the series. I imagine it will only get better as the series goes along. The wars are fantastic and the little scermishes aren't bad either. I highly recommend them.
2,"I wanted to like it (really, I did)","I really wanted to like this book. I think that the Drow are intereting and I was looking forward to the series. The writing isn't bad but the story doesn't move. It's too bad because there were a couple characters that I liked. After the first 100 pages, however, I couldn't justify investing any more time."
3,Dissapointment,"hmmmmm, what to say. this was a pretty good book but ive read better. As soon as i saw it i knew i had to have it, mostly because im obsessed with Drow. i read till i was done, but i wasnt very impressed with how it was written. i found that there were a few spelling mistakes, but mostly, there was the fact that the drow seemed liked gentle creatures (eg: when the males could be heard from the other room of the spa laughing and splashing and carrying on), when infact there ruthless, kniving, sadistic creatures. i dont really think that this book did them justice, only R.A.salvatore can really capture the true nature of the drow. also i was really, really dissapointed with the fight scenes. but if you can overlook the obvious problems the book is pretty well written, and i intend to get the next one."
3,"book is good, but the series is terrible","This is a very enjoyable book and it made me very excited about this series of 6 books. Great changes are promised in the world of the drow. Lots of exciting plot lines are opened up. And, Phaerun is a very fun character.However, I strongly recommend that you do not read this book! If you do you'll feel compelled to read all 6 books and the last book in this series is a steaming pile of dung.See my review of the 6th book to see my specific complaints. But, a quick summary is: Nothing happens.Numerous plot lines are opened up over the course of these 6 books, but absolutely none of them result in anything really changing. Two revolutions are started and then quashed. The god promises a big change and then does not change in any significant way. Characters are created and then killed off. Grand secret plots are plotted, executed, and then fail. An overthrow of the leadership almost happens, but then it doesn't."
2,I hope it gets better!,"I have to agree with Ravon24, without looking I found 13 grammatical errors that couldn't be missed. Byer's use of large words to make him sound intelligent filled the book with stumbling blocks which will confound a lot of readers, take the advice and have a dictionary handy of you don't have a well developed vocab.I miss Salvatore and the real Drow too much because the majority of the fight scenes in this book were dull and boring, I never want to hear about fencing again. The sinister race of Drow that I have come to love were soft and weak, they were way too close to each other to the extent of considering others as friends."
1,Beware...,"So, I really didn't like this book. The only character with any integrity was the sword master. All the other characters were 100% predictable in their actions. I didn't care one bit for anyone they could have all died and well...actually... I probably would have liked the book better if they did. If you are the type of reader who wants to become friends with the characters in the books that you read, this is not the book for you."
3,Allright,"This book was pretty good. I've always wanted to read more about Menzoberanzan, and this book did reveal many new facts about the city. But one of the characters, Quenthel, actually died in another book (Siege of Darkness, by RA Salvatore)! The author should have done more research."
3,I wanted to love it. In the end it liked it.,"This was the first, and the last book I will read by Byers.I have a sneaking suspicion that I mostly enjoyed the book because the plot was derived from the mind of my favorite author R.A. Salvatore.Byers writing is not definitively bad, it's just not good, especially when you consider the audience. His uncontrollable urge to write words that even readers with a doctorate will need to look up, is annoying at best, and obnoxiously out of context of the setting at worst. I mean really, what Forgotten Realms Drow uses the Latin derived medical term dyspepsia in conversation? NONE.Other than my gripes with the author, the story was interesting and kept me picking up the book for each chapter, so if you can overlook it, the book is worth the read"
5,No better book written that details dark elf society!,"Richard Lee Buyers has a great gift for dialogue, and making each character's lines specific to who they are. His writing was sharp, and often humorous. The action was detailed perfectly without grinding the story down to a halt. R.A. Salvatore gave readers the first in depth look into drow culture with Homeland, but Buyers fleshes out life in a dark elf city- from the dirty corners of the most squalid neighborhoods to the highest halls of power. The relationship between the characters Pharaun (my personal favorite) and Ryld is what sells the book. For me, relationships between the characters is as important as the plot- which is compelling on its own.I wish that Buyers continued writing the rest of the books in this series!"
3,Impressed !!!,This book maintained all of the flavor of Salvatore's novels in the underdark...I felt it was worth every penny!!
1,Cell Phone Case,The case that I received for my phone was of very poor quality and did not fit the way it was supposed to. I have since sent it back to get a refund issued.
3,Decent Equipment,"The charger and headphone work great but the phone did not fit in the phone holder, the phone holder is a piece of JUNK!!!!"
1,"No Critical Pedagogy, just political rhetoric","The only good thing is that the review system does not let me rate this zero stars. From the obscure language to the fight the system attitude, this book does nothing except expound upon Profesor McLaren's political views. This publication points at one facet of the discussion of critical pedagogy and fails to evaluate the other aspects. As a political work, this book appears well researched, but look elsewhere for a book on critical pedagogy."
1,"Display Problems, Bad Support","The display isn't working properly, so I sent an email to customer support. (There's no option to call them - email support only.) They're supposed to get back within 48 hours. 3 days later - still no response.The previous reviewer is correct. Even for free (plus the S/H charge), it's not worth it."
5,Great product. Great service/vendor,"Great-grandson wanted a fire truck ""toy box"". This was actually the product he wanted and we then understood after visiting his pre-school and seeing what he was trying to describe. Thanks!"
3,Great fun but TERRIBLE QUALITY,"My children love this tent but just 3 days after we bought it, I noticed two holes in the tent. I called and had a new tent sent out to me, assuming this one was a dud. When we received the new tent, I opened it for my kids and one of the metal pieces used to structure the tent, flung out. So, I examined the tent to find out where the piece came from. I found several places where they didn't complete the stitching for the seams so, the metal pieces were ready to fling out in several places plus, I found a small hole. My children love playing with this tent, it is lots of fun but so poorly made! I know it isn't possible that I have bought 2 duds! I paid $20 for this tent which I thought was pretty reasonable for something that my kids had so much fun with but I don't think it is worth paying $20 for something that is of such poor quality with holes in it and pieces that come apart. I am so disappointed!"
2,Playhut Fire Engine,"This Playhut didn't ever stand up appropriately (the side walls were slanted) and, therefore, it was returned. Perhaps the wire supports could be replaced with pvc or something that can be set up or down and hold the sides straight. It was purchased for a 16 month old toddler who love the idea, but we couldn't make it work for him because it kept falling over."
2,Was fun while it lasted,Very light doesn't bare with the kid's movement inside before it tumbles over. Also the seams took two times of folding only before it was tilted with no way of fixing it. Should have been heavier and stronger.
4,Good value and more durable than most,"We purchased this for our two sons, and they don't play with it as much as I thought they would, but I would still consider it a good buy. It's much more durable than the plastic type tents that are sold everywhere. My two year old has been tearing at it for three weeks now and it still looks brand new. Does take up a lot of space though."
3,Its difficult to reduce human behavior to a science,"This book's value pretty much depends upon the completion of a questionnaire, and like most questionnaires there's lots of wiggle room. You understand, right? That being said, I believe it has significant value and excellent observations and suggestions, many of which will possibly assist people who are striving to make a change in their lives. But it also highlights the fact that human behavior is anything but a science ..... yet. Definitely worth a read, but keep your expectations at a reasonable setting."
4,Brain Chemistry Plan,"I agree with the book because I have tried many of the doctor's suggestions and you do have to feed your body nutritionally, to have the brain work right. We can't ignore our body's needs and definitely when we are under stress. I found the book an excellent reference for everyone to control depression, and the stresses of life. We all need help and even if we need to take medication, this book is also a great alternative method."
4,Convoluted but highly useful,"Well - I see my view of the book doesn't line up with others' view. I have not used it as a design handbook, but more of a background info source.I have used this book frequently to determine types of pipe to consider, details of types of pipe material etc. I use it to 'teach' young engineers. It has the best overview of material types, appropriate uses. It is the only source I have been able to find that lists all the ANSI / ASTM and other standards for various pipe types. It has good overviews of all types of piping (PVC / CPVC / Grey Iron / Ductile Iron etc etc etc). I don't know of anywhere else to get such a broad description of all this type of info.It is not a design manual... but is unsurpassed for reference and background info... which is the reason I bought it."
1,An annoying verbiage,"I was interesting in buying a professional publication relative to piping engineering and, by chance, I was able to borrow this book from a technical library before doing what can not be undone.How disappointing !An annoying verbiage prevails over pages after pages.Few design guidelines, engineering calculations and good practice recommendations.For instance, the section dealing with the water hammer phenomenon does not contain any equation !Supports, insulation, valves, plastic and composite materials, ... are covered in far too general terms.Even the reduced ""dictionary alike"" paper format leads to a bulky and difficult to read book where chapters are broken down in dozens of pages.This book must be viewed as a general introduction to piping design engineering but definitively not as a practical reference for day-to-day design issues."
1,This book is a POS. Period.,"Do not buy this book. I repeat, do not buy this book. This book is probably over a thousand pages thick but it's poorly organized and poorly written. I highly recommend the Navco Piping Datalog over this piece of garbage. The Navco book is only 240 pages but it's very useful if you are a piping engineer.Actually, I use my Piping Handbook almost every day. It's not so bad as a foot rest."
2,poor book,"I Buy this book because needed references, general conditions and good practice to solve practical problems of pipes. However I meet with a tangled book, of little clarity and that in general it doesn't embrace the practical topics well referring a lot to the existent norms. Anyway it serves like support to the different norms to go developing a project but alone as reference and in any case like a book of easy access to solve problems on site or the day to day problems."

5,Charming Love Story,"Lovely Judy Garland, an office worker, meets sensitive soldier Robert Walker, who has a two-day leave in New York. This is a charming and captivating love story. If you like World War II romances, as I do, you'll love this one.--Diana Dell, author, ""A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories."""
5,"DVD Quality, anyone?","I wish someone who has purchased this item would write about the quality of the DVD. Since Amazon also sells the VHS, it would help in deciding which to buy - the DVD or the VHS. DVDs last longer than VHS, but unfortunately not all are tranferred very well.I've seen this movie on television, and would now like to purchase the DVD, but only if the quality is good."
3,Sappy,"I bought this film after hearing about how popular it was with homefront audiences during World War Two. It's sappier than most films of that era, but it is enjoyable. Minnelli seemed to have been just getting his feet wet, which would explain some of the scenes that just don't work very well (like the characters laughing at Robert Walker as he's running alongside the bus, or the inane conversation of the girls at the museum), but other scenes work surprisingly well, like the kid who starts screaming when Walker comes over to him! It's not the best film to come out of World War Two's home front, but the notion of two total strangers meeting, falling in love, and getting married during a 48 hour leave is just kooky enough. Walker and Garland take you along for the ride, and you do find yourself rooting for them."
3,Not as wonderful as I'd hoped.,"This movie, only now out on DVD, does not impress me as a classic. It's slow. The writing is adequate. The characters are not that engaging. It's not baaad. It's just nothing to write home about."
5,The Clock,"They just don't make movies like this any more. I enjoyed it and the fact that Judy did not sing in the movie reinforces the nature of the love story. In other words you are not put aside listening to music instead of concentrating on the love between two people. If you never saw this movie, you do not know what you are missing."
4,Great dvd,I love these workouts. There is 1 10min. cardio. 1 10 min cardio w/ weights. 1 10 min. upper body & 1 10 min. lower body. Also 1 10 min. ab workout. There great to do one at a time or all together. Very motivating & energizing! Love the Biggest Loser cast.
3,Bob is not the Trainer.,"Its good in that it gives you a different workout for everyday to motivate you to do it everyday. But I don't like that it deceives in thinking that Bob is the trainer like the other Biggest Loser DVDS. BOB IS NOT THE TRAINER, the biggest losers are the trainers on all of the workouts. The workouts are broken up into 10 minute mini workouts and rearragned depending on the level and the day you choose."
1,Biggest Loser 30 day jump start,I have several other Biggest Loser DVD's and this one is too slow and I am not impressed that passed contestants are instructing the workouts and it's not Bob. It's very boring and not upbeat enough!
4,Just What I needed!,"Since I am about 30 pounds over weight, I really needed a tape a 66 year old lady could handle. This is just a little rough on me, but I get better each time I do the routine. I like the 10 minute sessions. Hopefully I will get to the point where I can complete the entire 30 minutes. But not there yet."
4,Good for beginner but not for the advanced.,"Each workout is 10 min with a quick warm up and cool down. As a more advanced I combined several workouts together. However for a quick workout, the contestant leds these and it is awesome to see what they have learned and to teach and demostrate during the workout. Sione and Tara are a funny combo, as they Sione says that he can beat her and Tara the work horse she is, welcomes the challenge and that was during the plank, Which I do for no more then 3 sets of 3 min. It's a great supplement for a even workout with another workout like the last chance or a gym routine. You can make it as hard or easy as you like with the weights or combing them together. Well worth the price. Hope this helps."
4,Good for me!,This is exactly what I needed to start working out. I love the biggest loser and felt comfortable working out with these people. I really need simple exercises to start and this is what they do. I even had a hard time with some of them being too difficult. Nice and simple enough to get me moving. I think that is the whole point of this dvd.....to get you moving. The baby step if you will.
3,FINE WORKOUT,"During the last months I have bought all ""The Biggest Loser"" Dvds, and I have enjoyed doing this like others, but I prefer the ones where Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper are the trainers. In this dvd, the winner contestants, from different seasons of the programm, are the trainers and I think these workouts are too easy.Maybe it is because they are not professional certified trainers, I do not know. Anyway I will do this exercise dvd on these days when I need a softer exercise, because I feel sore or maybe I am not in the mood."
3,Not a Beginners Workout!,"I bought this thinking that it was a beginners workout. Not so! Even though the program is divided into quick 10 minute workouts over the 30 days, they were brutal and had me struggling to keep up. I'm not totally unfit either. I can do a full 4 mile workout with Leslie Sansone, no problem. But the high impact aerobics in this program had me struggling to keep up and had my joints begging for mercy. I'm not very overweight either. I wonder how a very overweight person (presumably the target market for this DVD) will be able to keep up, even with the modified moves."
4,KICKED MY BUTT!,"My only complaint is it doesn't tell you upfront that you will need other equipment to do some of the exercises... Like an exercise ball, etc"
3,10 minute workouts,"I am completely satisfied with the dvd. It is a good start up workout dvd for people who have not exercised for awhile. Ten minute work outs, easy for most ages and you do what you can. I am in my 60's and find that doing 2 of the work out's each day is great."
2,disappointing,I own all of the Biggest Loser Fitness DVD's and all of Jillian Michael's DVDs. I bought this one thinking that Bob was going to be the trainer and was very disappointed that Bob wasn't in there at all. Although I did sweat a little (but I did all 5 10-minute segments)..the trainers are very new to training obviously...their cues were awful and I felt that I had to watch the screen at all times to find out when they were starting the next move and what it would be. I really didn't like this DVD and am considering giving it away as I really don't like the workout. If only Bob had been in it.
3,bogus info,"This is NOT an out of print title, as sparkle7 claims, and in fact is available brand new for $18.95 from Lushan Press, P.O. Box 3863, Eugene, OR 97403. Sparkle7 received a free copy and is now trying to capitalize on it."
1,wrinkle cream by Lancome,this cream gave me such a rash it was Horriable Please save your face and do not use this iteam you will also save money i normally use olay that ALWAYS works i will never change again.Lancome High Resolution Refill Triple Action Renewal Anti Wrinkle Cream 2.6 oz
5,Great book,I purchased this text book and it is great book for the class that I am takeing. The book does a great job at breaking down the thought process behind solving problems. Explaining how we miss the solution to a problem by looking at the wrong part of the issue. Many times we over analyze things so much that we cant see the most simple things.
5,great,It said it was used but it looked brand new to me so im happy with it. The cd was even still in it. i will use textbooks r us again for sure.
1,Rip Off - Bait and Switch - Cheats,"I am angry that this second (last) rate company feels it is acceptable to advertize one product (Bicycle brand) and send a cheap no name substite from Taiwan. They charge 20% to ship the product, and will not refund shipping if you want to return this bait and switch product. As you can see, the other review got the same treatment ... what I wonder if that other reviewer a true customer or a company employee trying to set expectations. I thought Amazon was more selective in the companies it offered up to its customers."
1,False Advertising,Standard Playing Cards - Pinochle (DZN)The ad for this product show a box of BICYCLE(Brand)PINOCHLE PLAYING CARDS which is why I ordered them along with the price. I received 12 boxes of no brand cards made in TAWIAN which are completely unacceptable and will be returned. As result of this problem I need to buy my cards at a local store at a considerable increase in cost. This will also result in my no longer buying on-line from Amazon clients. Neil A Lieb
1,bait and switch,they show you a picture of bicycle pinochle cards but list a cheap brand on thr order
2,Poor construction,"Purchased several of these for an outdoor program. The knob on one of them didn't work right out of the box, and a knob from another came off and was stripped during it's first trip. The stove itself seems to work OK, but without a working knob it makes it frustrating to use (pliers!)."
2,Green T-shirts,"Though I ordered the large size [Iwear a Medium], it was still a tight fit. The color is not olive drab, but green. The seams are coming apart after only two or three washings. Not a product worth the price."
4,A nice tribute to Sebastian Brant,"Firstly, I am not a reader or tarot enthusiast. I purchased the Ship of Fools by Brian Williams purely for the art. This deck is based on the late 15th century work ""Narrenschiff"" by Sebastian Brant. Four out of Five stars. Why? I wasn't really thrilled with the ""playing card"" feel of the deck. Other than that...The Late Mr. Williams was a wonderful artist and stayed true to the spirit of the original art of the ""Ship of Fools"". If there was a deviation from the original work, Mr. Williams explained why he made the choices that he did as well as compared the design with other well known tarot decks.The cards are a delight to look upon; crisp and clean lines with love and humor thrown in. It is a worthy final work for a man who dedicated much of his life and career to the study of the art and history of tarot. The book is nicely compose and a quick read, the perfect accompaniment to the cards."
1,Mislabeled --- NOT TAROT,"This is not a tarot deck, nor a book on the interpretation of such. It is a Dover edition of Sebastian Brandt's 1494 BOOK, The Ship of Fools."
5,Cheaper Alternative for School,"I bought this for a class. The content of the book is great... if you can find what you're looking for. If you're using this book for school, you'll definitely need to grab a few highlighters in different colors. The format of the book is all mashed together and it's easy to overlook details and when it comes to MARC, the details matter. Though this picture shows the 3rd edition, the book that came to me was a 4th edition. My class was using the 5th edition so no complaints there. I haven't run into any major differences between the two (aside from page numbers) so unless your teacher is being strict about the book you're using, this one will get you through. Even the quoted examples are identical as well as the labeling."
2,absolutely horrible,I would not recommend this book to anyone. I enjoy most of Maxwell's writtings but this is just too much for me. Going from compelte hatred to soul bonding love in less then 24 hours because of one night of sex? Please... I want realism to my story... It only gets 2 stars because of the humor within the story.
3,Disappointing,I hate books where the heroine spends the whole time saying she knows she shouldn't be doing this (it will literally ruin her life and her sisters in this case) but she just can't help it... I never understood exactly what the Duke's hold up was. The plot external to the love story was making up for it but that part got no resolution! The books pacing was also poor and the ending was abrupt. I like Cathy Maxwell generally but this book was just disappointing.
3,Nice Read.. Not a keeper for the collection,"A nice story. I really like the H/H, but the ending was a little abrupt. I agree that the writer could have prolonged the antagonism between the two characters more for a steamier romance. This was a quick and easy read. A good book to check-out at the library, but definately not one to buy. Go get Seduce me at Sunrise by Kleypas or Heart of Fire by Martin."
2,YUCK!!!!,This is the first book I have read of Miss Maxwell's and I was not impressed! I thought it was BORING and UNBELIEVABLE! The main characters were dull and I thought passionless. It took me a long time to finish this book!
3,"Mourning the ""old"" Cathy Maxwell","Where did the old Cathy Maxwell go? She used to be one of the best Regency romance writers in the genre. Her earlier works were so much better than this one. Yes, plot moves along quickly (too quickly, at some points) and the hero and heroine are likeable, but Maxwell's writing has been ""dumbed-down."" I think that the Avon editors have really done a disservice to Maxwell. Read some of her earlier books to see the way she can really write. I think it's time she switched publishing houses and allowed her creativity and intelligence to shine through again."
3,So so,"This is the first Cathy Maxwell book I have ever read, so I can't compare it to her others. But, this was just not a very well-written book, IMO. The characters and their relationship was not adequately developed. There was a lot of action going on in the book, maybe too much for the length of the book. The relationship between the main characters ended up seeming almost a subplot - not what I am looking for in a romance novel."
2,Not a very strong book,"Phillip Maddox, the Duke of Closter is the man at the center of a scandel. His bride-to-be has jilted him. Charlotte Cameron is the sister of the intented bride. Due to her sister actions she has been shunned by the Ton. They meet again when Phillip recieves word that his brother is alive. The brother that should have been the Duke. Now the two are running though out Scotland, trying to survive and find out the truth.""In the Bed of a Duke"" is the lastest offering by Cathy Maxwell and its not her best. The plotline seems to a good one, but the whole book seems rushed and not believible. This maybe a book not to read."
2,Bought another dustpan set!,"As soon as I held this, I knew I wouldn't like it. The handle is very light and doesn't feel comfortable in hand. The brush is too wide and bulky and I just disliked this set so much that I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought an OXO set. I like it SO much more. Not worth sending this one back, once I pay the shipping so my loss :("
5,Best duster/dustpan I've ever had - back for 2nd,"I'm buying a second Rubbermaid duster & dustpan set because my husband swiped the first (he also thinks it's the best he's ever used). It's excellent for getting debris off counters or floors, w/o flinging it all over everywhere. Also it sweeps up fine particles. If you need stiff bristles (like a whisk broom), this is not for you as the bristles are soft.Recommend."
4,Good Set,"This Rubbermaid Duster and Dustpan Set is performing as expected. Did not cost a whole lot and was delivered promptly and almost immediately after put to good use. Not very large in size, still it has become very helpful while doing what it does best. 4 Stars."
3,Works Fine,"Wish the front was a bit wider, but other than that it's fine. Came with some of the back bristles already bent, not a huge deal. Comfortable handle."
1,Very cheaply made...not worth the $,"I bought these to hang jeans and dress slacks, but they definitely will not sustain the weight of denim. I ordered 2 sets. 1 hanger arrived broken at the top. Upon using another hanger the same top part broke. I'm just waiting for the other 2 hangers to break.I'm going to buy the more expensive (hopefully better made) Friction Swing Arm Slack Hanger.UPDATE: I bought the more expensive ""Friction Swing Arm Slack Hanger"" - wow what a difference! Much sturdier and much better made. Comparing the 2 is like apples to oranges. Don't waste your money buying this model unless you need it for something very lightweight, go with the Friction Swing Arm model instead.PS: If this review helped you please vote for it..."
5,My kitchen counter mats,"I am enjoying my mats so much, they are just what I was looking for, they brighten up my kitchen counters and match them perfectly.Thanks very much for your fine product!!! I will use your site when looking for other hard to find ofject.Madge Gentry"
3,"Good set, but...","I was reading other reviews. I don't have much of a problem with rust or dulling even with washing in the dishwasher. I think the larger knives are great. However, I do have a problem with the blades breaking and this is not from abuse. The tip of the small paring knive broke off. My main issue is with the steak knives. I have 2 with broken blades! One broke when it got dropped on the floor (ok accidents do happen). I can't remember how the other one broke.I'm not sure if I want to replace the broken ones or just buy new steak knives.I have had this set for 4 years. In my opinion, under normal use, blades should not break!"
5,excellent,"excellent set of knives are for life, you never get corrupted and you forget to re-buy knives because they are eternal"
2,Bad quality product,"The product purchased is sharp, however, it rusts very quickly, just the first time I put it in the dishwasher."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"For Christmas this past year I decided I wanted a good knife set. Of course I did my research and thought I had found a set that would work well and not break the bank. Plus, I love Kitchenaid products so I figured it was a brand I could trust. When I received them I took care to read all the information that came along with the knives, taking special note that they must be handwashed. For about the first month I loved these knives...they worked so well and cut through most everything. However, they soon became very dull and began to rust excessively, despite the fact that I hand wash them and dry them. Now, 9 months later I am forced to sharpen the knives each time I use them, sometimes even between different foods and they are totally stained with rust spots. I'm back on Amazon to find a new set of knives that will not let me down, so I figured I'd stop and leave a review in the hope that I may spare someone else the disappointment and waste of money that I have experienced."
1,KitchenAid Knife Set,These knives are horrible. They don't hold any kind of good sharpness at all. I have to buy a new set after just one year. I am very disappointed with KitchenAid.
1,necesito el tracking del paquete,necesito el traking por favor para saber cuando llega el paquete lo mas pronto posible les agradezco gracias me envia un mensaje
2,They were all rusted!!!,"Hello. I would like to express my dissapointment with the set of knives of KitchenAid I bought from you. Just after the first wash they were all rusted, hence not useful anymore. I can't understand how this happened, specially after such good reputation of this brand. I don't like this set anymore, because it's imposible to use and that not make me happy. Since this is the firts time something like this happens to me, I would appreciate your support. Thanks for your prompt response. Regards."
1,"RUST BUCKET! Looked good, cuts well.","I have had this set for at least 3 years now. The set looks good and cuts well. All the knives started showing rust spots shortly after purchase. Now the rusting is all over. I wouldn't want to put these rusted knives on any of my food. I had a stainless Cuisinart set previously, but wanted the black block look in our new kitchen. The Cuisinart set had no rust issue... I should have kept it! This would be a great set and I wold rate it a five star if not for the rusting which make them unusable; unless you don't mind getting a tetnus shot when your done eating!"
2,Ugly rusting,"only 2 months using these knives and they are pretty rusted :(... I don't even know how to clean them to get the rust out, and in such a short time... I feel robbed :( and thery were a wedding present..."
2,Not worth the price; will rust,"I bought this set of knives because of the brand recognition and stylish, no-rivets design. From the get go, I noticed the Kitchen Aid logo started to fade after a few washes and they weren't particularly sharp, especially compared to an older set of Chicago Cutlery knives that I wanted to replace. The real shortcoming, though, and what really alarmed me, started after a few months of normal use when suddenly the steel started to show signs of pitting, and eventually, rust. This is unfortunate because it means that a manufacturer like Kitchen Aid is using less than top quality materials and charging a premium on brand alone. In contrast, the old Chicago Cutlery knives are so tough and durable they show no signs of rust even after almost 20 years of use in my kitchen. Should've stuck with them."
2,CAJA VIOLENTADA Y DESTROZADA,"Buen Día he comprado varias veces por éste medio y 1 era vez que me pasa ésto, la caja donde venía el juego de cuchillos estaba totalmente abierta por un lado y para completar destrozada, me parece EL COLMO ya que era para un regalo, al menos los cuchillos llegaron bien pero de igual forma NO PODRE HACER EL REGALO PORQUE ME DA PENA REMENDAR LA CAJA Y ENTREGAR EL REGALO. En fin el fin de la compra NO se pudo concretar. Ahhh y de paso es hecho en china. En Fin."
1,Absolute garbage,"We finally broke down and bought a new knife set and settled on this one due to the look and Kitchenaid reputation. Boy are we sorry. We've had this set for a little over a year and 2 of the table knives broke. The blade just snapped in half. Not from abuse, just having a dish get laid on top of them in the sink. Avoid these at all cost."
4,Massimo at the max!,"If you're tired of hearing classically trained tenors and baritones attempting the equivalent of Italian folk songs, then this is for you. His voice is very nice and very genuine. If you love Neapolitan music, give this one a try!"
3,They are OKAYYY ... but...,"Eh... they will do I guess. Not military quality.. I went through a whole box just testing. Most of them work. Some do not (maybe the coating process in manufacturing has a flaw??) .. the sticks are weak so if you press too hard on the box the stick WILL break. Very brittle. Also, the striker strip on the box wears away very easily. The one box I tested weared off with about 10 strikes. Just peeled right off (in pieces). I had to use the strip on another box to continue testing. If you are serious about waterproof matches and want something reliable I'd have to say pass on these. But if you just want a cheap ""when you need em"" kinda thing then these are great for the price. Just don't expect too much."
3,4 boxes is not a 12 pack,"OK my math is rusty BUT the picture says 12 PACK, meaning 12 boxes. 4 boxes arrived. is this the new math I have heard so much about?"
1,"Better off with ""Home Comforts""","""Home Comforts"" has been so helpful and authoritative that I preordered ""Laundry"" as soon as it was announced. I was very disappointed to find that it consisted almost entirely of material taken from her previous book. If Cheryl Mendelson feels that she needs to revise ""Home Comforts"", she should go over the entire book and bring out a second edition.If you already have ""Home Comforts"", you don't need to buy ""Laundry""; and if you don't have ""Home Comforts"", you need to buy it. But I see little reason to buy ""Laundry"". I am returning my copy."
3,Chapters 14-28 of Home Comforts now reissued in hardcover,"Laundry is simply recycled and slightly refined material from Mendelson's Home Comforts. If you already own Home Comforts, I would skip Laundry (or if you must have it, wait until the paperback comes out, likely some time next year). If, however, you don't care about food storage, bathroom cleaning, domestic employment laws, fireplaces, resilient flooring materials, ""other components of household dust,"" and you just want a well written, thorough, up-to-date guide to clothes and linens, then Laundry is a fine purchase, worth the current price."
5,From washing and folding to fabric storage.,"It's surprising to see a book entirely devoted to housekeeping and one might wonder what could be said about laundry which could occupy an entire book on the topic; but LAUNDRY: THE HOME COMFORTS BOOK OF CARING FOR CLOTHES AND LINENS actually holds many surprises. For one thing, it culls from the bestselling HOME COMFORTS newly revised, updated information on caring for cloth, from bedding and baby clothes to vintage linens. Details cover such specifics as when to disregard labels, how to remove stains, and how to properly store fabrics. Chapters also cover all kinds of care: ironing, folding, and washing. Homemakers will find LAUNDRY an invaluable reference."
3,A bit....long.,"Dont get me wrong, this book is PACKED with information. Hundreds of densely printed pages of it, with some black and white drawn illustrations. The enthusiasm for textile, fabrics and the technique and history of it all sparks from all pages. So much so, that I have given up on reading it.It's my own fault: I was hoping for an concise illustrated guide in Laundry 101; pictures of commonly made errors, that sort of thing. Maybe that info is hidden somewhere in the book, but I'm afraid it will stay there, unread."
2,Mediocre melodrama from an otherwise talented author,"""Love With a Scandalous Lord"" was the best romance I read last year (and will remain one of my favorites for a long time)but this was a disappointment. Kitty was a bit annoying and didn't use good old American sense. The hero's tactics weren't really noble or heroic. I love Victorian England and she could have utilized the time period more. This couple just wasn't as passionate or exciting as some of her heroes and heroines."
2,An Invitation to Seduction,"I really enjoyed To Marry an Heiress and naturally thought I would like this book but I didn't. Robert and Kitty character were hard to connect.I found Robert a little to arrogant and shallow. Althought Kitty was a kind and sweet person, she worried about society and mother past too much.Was this review helpful?"
4,Sherlock Holmes meets Frankenstein,"In this 1939 film, Boris Karloff makes his last appearance as the Frankenstein monster and Basil Rathbone gives a wonderful performance as the next ""mad scientist"" who gets caught up in the mayhem. The story, music and sets work quite well. Bela Lugosi is quite good as Igor and this is the last film in the series that really stands on its own. Much of the ""Inspector"" was later spoofed in ""Young Frankenstein"" generations later. Lionel Atwill gave a wonderful performance in this role as well as many others for the ""classic monsters"" series Universal films. The print and sound quality of the VHS release was good. This film was also released on Laserdisc, but I wasn't able to get a copy. Hopefully, it will find its way to DVD in the very near future. The film appears to be quite well preserved. This seems to be true of nearly all of the Universal ""monster"" films I have seen."
4,Exactly as described.,"Fits as expected, thin plastic, but what I figured for the price. Has survived a few automatic car washes as well."
2,Cheap Binding,"Letting the other reviews critique the content, I would like to mention that I was unimpressed with the quality of the binding.Although I may be a unique occurence, the binding of my book was cheap and broke so that several pages came loose. For an $80 book I expect better durability than a paperback."
2,Taylor dares call this an introduction...,"I took a course in Stochastic Processes using this book... this book attempts to review some of the statistics that you would need to understand the major topics of this course; however, your background in stats MUST be bulletproof else you will be quite lost in the woods. It helps if you have a very good instructor teaching the course without having to figure out the difference between his symbols and the authors' symbols! (NOTE: I took this course as a graduate student at Wayne State in Detroit... this course can be a career killer; I ended up dropping the course halfway into the semester!)"
2,Uniden DXAI4288-2,"Purchased this item after long and satisfactory experience with Uniden products. Good functions and easy to use, but very noisy and poor reception. Not recommended."
1,Waste of Money,We bought this phone thinking it was a great deal. It gets horrible reception even when right next to the receiver. The volume level on it is so low that I have to be in a room with no other noise in order to hear someone speak. It was a complete waste of money and now I have to spend money on another phone and throw this one out.
1,One critical design flaw...,"Consider this before buying it: eventhough TWO handsets are included in the box and it's clearly advertised by Uniden as a ""dual-handset"" model, only ONE handset can be used at the same time!!!In other words, once you pick up an incoming call the other handset is useless. This is basic functionality that anyone can reasonably expect from a phone, isn't it? I know my parents will usually want to participate in the conversation at the same time and that's why I gave them this phone as a gift. Poor choice on my side, we are returning it now.To make this worse, this ""little detail"" is only mentioned in page #57 of the User's Manual under ""Troubleshooting"". No mention of this whatsoever in the packaging.If this is important to you just cross this phone out of your list. Best luck."
1,TRASH,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE BOUGHT ONE FOR MY MOM AND ONE FOR ME. THE RECEPTION IS HORRIBLE AND ALL I CAN HEAR IS STATIC SAME WITH HERS!!!!!
1,Can you go lower than 1 star?,"This has the WORSE reception of any phone I've ever had and that includes a $5 stationary dial phone! It's cheap plastic and for the price, not worth it! I already have a Uniden that has lasted and done well for quite awhile, but this one is junk. The ""second"" phone is pointless. Transferring a call from one to the other is a waste of time. I took it back after 3 days and bought an ATT!"
3,Returned,This is an older phone having only 10 slots of phone number memory which is not enough. Difficult to program the numbers in. The sound leaves MUCH to be desired and whistles if you turn the volume up high for hard hearing folks - like me!!! I returned it to the seller for full credit though but would not buy another --- I bought a newer ATT model and love it.
2,Good primer...30 years ago,"As a first time sales manager, I was immediately drawn to the title of the book. After reading it, I was disappointed that the published date was simply the most recent edition date. The core of the book was written decades ago.As a result, other than some very general good advice about a manager's job being to coach and develop sales talent, the book is not useful. To give you an example, it goes into detail about keeping index cards and how a real go-getter salesperson will always be seen in a phone booth contacting clients!I will research the original publication date of business books more carefully next time."
5,Best to keep a manciure,This is the best thing that ever happened to nails. I could never live without it.
4,Great book,"This is one of the best economics books I have read. It provides a good overview of the ongoing debate on some of the most relevant and still unresolved issues confronting economists today. But, unlike many economists, Skousen avoids verbosity and jargon; he presents quite complex issues simply and clearly. I also greatly enjoyed one of his other books, 'The making of modern economics'. Together, these books have challenged my views on many issues, including the causes of the great depression, the role of government in the economy, and the merits of a gold standard. The contribution of the Chicago and Austrian schools was badly neglected by my university lecturers, and I found 'Vienna & Chicago' a thoroughly fascinating read."
4,Detailed and informative,"Any student of economics should read this fascinating book. Skousen covers a neglected school of thought known as Austrian economics--a discipline rarely discussed on TV or in the classroom. (I never heard a word about in any of the economics classes I took in college). taking economics classes. Skousen discusses the philosophical disagreements between the Chicago and Austrian schools objectively, with no obvious bias either way.If you think all free market-leaning economists have the same views, you'll change your mind after reading the book. The two schools widely differ on a number of issues--the cause of the Great Depression, the wisdom of antitrust laws, how to revive the economy during a recession, and many others. Vienna & Chicago is one of the best economic books of the last few years."
4,Insightful comparison...some flawed conclusions,"Overall, I really liked this book. The opportunity to gain insight into the differences and similarities between the two big free-market schools of economic thought from one of the premier insiders in the freedom movement makes the read definitely worthwhile. I disagreed with some of his conclusions. In fact, I thought the cases he built in some of the chapters actually should have led to the opposite conclusion, but it is, after all, an opinion piece and not an objective study. As an Austrian, it is difficult to hear that being right is not always as important as fitting in...but that seems to be the case. I would recommend this book as a good primer for those who have not pinned down their philosophical loyalty."
3,Average....,Fodor's certainly needs to put out an updated version since this one is 2 years old. I've yet to visit the region so I cannot judge the accuracy of info but I did not like the feel of this guide.I bought this together with the Frommer's Scandinavia. I like that one much better...
3,Canadiana,"If you were a Canadian grade-schooler in 1967, you'll enjoy revisiting the Centennial celebrated in song. Share your memories with your children through these easy to sing-a-long songs from The Travellers."
4,Okay Toy,"It is fun on its own for awhile,but you need other LEGO toys for better fun.The toy teaches you how to put together parts but that is it.A few lego peices came off when I played with it,but it was pretty strong.I know it would smash to pieces if it hit a wall though."
3,Too much money!,This Lego is great I remember this from when I was a kid but there are plenty of places to get it cheaper. Bricklink has reasonable prices and a great selection. I just don't want to see fellow Lego lover's get ripped off.
5,THE CHROME CRUSHER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Chrome Crusher is really cool! I mean,real working lights,Tools,and a peice of ore with an energy crystal! THIS IS THE BEST!! ..."
1,technical,"i recently ordered this book based upon reviews and was disappointed. i wasn't able to wade through the technical language and writing style of this book. i don't doubt the amount of information that is here, but if i can't access it, it is of little use to me. perhaps i'll find something else more useful to me."
2,Ancient,I am so sorry that I bought this book. i found it to be old and outdated. Majority of the stuff did not apply to me as my OS is Windows XP and this book's most recent OS seems to be Windows ME. I am so sorry I did not realize this before I bought it. I think that this book is for people still running the older operating systems.
4,Upright Vacuum Cleaner Belts,Unfortunally these belts nor any of the other 3 that I bought elsewhere would fit my Vacuum cleaner. This doesn't reflect on Amazon though. They sent the item as promised.
3,Vibration - Tight Glove,Ok first off this is a tight glove for those of us with bigger hands.Makes the funniest noise on high...sounds like a swarm of bees.Vibration is not too bad.BUT this unit is LOUD...and I mean LOUD...With my bigger hands it was hard to get it on just right.I would suggest just a regular wand massager or the likes and maybe skip on this one..Unless you true use.
1,Pompous Crap,"After slogging through most of this book, I had to stop and put it down. It is horribly boring, long-winded, and pompous.Most of McGinn's real philosophical work is beautifully written; Logical Properties, for example, is an outstanding piece of clear thinking and lucid exposition on difficult issues.But this book is written quite badly. I suspect that McGinn just wrote the book more or less off the top of his head to make a fast buck. Don't waste your time and money."
5,The making of McGinn,"I learned about McGinn via the work of Jerry Fodor. ""The Making of a Philosopher"" was the first book I read from him. This book is a rather good portrait of the intellectual development of a person. It is fascinating to see how his interests in philosophy develop and the persons involved. The book has the additional benefit of containing philosophical explanations that are short, to the point and clear.McGinn also comes across as a very likable chap, unlike some of the pompous gits one finds frequently in philosophy (for a sample of these individuals just take a look at the reviews in this page)."
3,A good read,"I recently finished reading this book and I think that overall it is a good read. I am not a philosopher by training (I am a historian) but I purchased this book because I am a philosopher in my own way and I have always read philosophy.I can not give this book five or four stars however because there were times when the author McGinn got boring and dull. His philosophical explanations were not all too clear making me wonder if it was because the philosophies he was trying to explain were too difficult by nature or if he had simply chosen complex definitions by choice. One thing is for sure, McGinn is very candid and honest and this makes the book worth reading.I think he could have focused more on other philosophers and thrown a little more of his personal intellectual life since this is a memoir, but overall this book was a good read. I did feel an injection of intellectual urge for wanting to read more philosophy during and after reading this book. I do recommend it."
4,"Brief, interesting, insightful","How do people become professional philosophers? Why are some so strongly compelled by the analytic (philosophy of language) tradition in philosophy? It is these questions that CM illuminates in his brief but very readable 'intellectual' memoir. If these questions don't interest you -- as it appears they did not interest certain reviewers on this page -- don't bother reading TMoaP. If they do, read on. You're sure to be rewarded for the few hours' effort. 4 stars, not 5, only because the rewards -- in my view -- were not as ample as they might have been. By which I mean: I greatly enjoyed reading TMoaP; I only wish it had gone longer and at greater depth into the areas of CM's philosophical interest. Guess I'll have to give CM's 'serious' philosophy a read sometime. TMoaP succeeds on two levels: it is an interesting and entertaining memoir, and a spur to further -- and deeper -- reading in philosophy. What more should a reader expect?"
1,it just doesn't work.,"I left it on for 4 minutes, then I tried 6 minutes, and finally I tried 8 minutes (the longest time recommended). Didn't lose a single hair, but did get irritated skin (not bad, luckily). Maybe you have to have a certain hair type for this to work? It didn't even get the peach fuzz on my chin, much less the coarser hairs that I usually pluck. At least it didn't cost me much, since it was a complete waste of money."
4,Sally Hanson Facial Hair Remover,"This product works very well. I didn't give it 5 stars because it claims to have a soft brush, sorry that's not true, the brush is stiff and hard to use. Once you get it on, it does the job very well."
1,Terrible burns!,"I tried this product and left it on for the recommended 2 minutes. It felt like it was burning, but I figured that was just because it was working. Well, I removed it, noticed some hair still there, so as the package said I could put it on those areas again for another 2 minutes. After that I was in so much pain. It removed the hair but gave me 2nd degree burns on my face! Very Very painful. My skin oozed for a coupole of days and then scabbed over. It looked horrible! Please give me my hair back. I'd prefer the blonde fuzzy hair to the burned painful, ugly skin I ended up with! Wish I could give it 0 stars!"
4,Decent for removing upper lip/chin hair,"I guess I'm going against the crowd and have to say I like this product quite a bit. It's not perfect but it helps me take off most of the hair on my upper lip and the soft hair on my chin.The only bad thing about that is, if you leave the cream on for more than 8 minutes, it tends to sting for an hour or two after wiping off the cream. So if the hair comes off around 6 minutes, please happily do so!Tip: BE SURE TO USE WARM MOIST PAPER TOWEL. It'll help with removing the hair. :)"
1,Worst Product EVER!,"Worst method of hair removal and product I have ever used in my life (and I've used sooooo many!!!). This will easily win an award for worst hair removal product in history. It doesn't remove any hair at all and simply destroys your skin. I had to go on medication after using this, my skin was destroyed and I suffered bad chemical burns! It blistered, burned like hell and caused major acne breakout. ABsolutely the worst experience EVER. Run for the hills. This product should be discontinued!!!I will never buy anything from Sally Hanson again."
5,Gentle and effective,"I'm surprised this product has so many negative reviews.I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried many hair removal products like nair, depil silk and surgi. This is the only product that didn't burn my skin. It also removes the 5'oclock shadow that many other products would leave behind, and lasts long. This will be the only product I use from now on."
2,Not as good as their cream,"I had been using the cream that came in a tube. (made by the same company) It worked well and consistently for me. I purchased this brush on one because I assumed it was the same product just with a different applicator. It doesn't work nearly as well as the tube. I'm going back to the tube version but I'm worried that this is an overall formula change for the company, in which case, neither will work."
1,I think the Devil invented this hair remover!,"By the way my husband is Daniel, I am a female that tried this and it was awful!!!!! It did not remove any hair and left my skin red, burned and irritated!!!!!!! worst product ever."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I didn't use this product on my face, as some of those with negative comments did, and for me, it worked VERY well. I'd tried hair removal products years ago and saw this on sale in the local CVS. In less than 10 minutes, the cream did its job and the hair came right off (note: I did use a washcloth). The scent was decent/not chemically and my skin was not at all irritated. They do make other products specifically for facial hair, so if you're considering using it for that purpose, maybe you should think twice. But for body hair, great product!"
2,Can't recommend,"Well, I have finally hit that age where I noticed a shadow above my upper lip appearing...(where IS that graceful aging??)...I tried plucking a few hairs, but that didn't seem feasible on my whole upper lip..so I went ahead and bought this product. I tried bleaching first, but that seemed to burn and I had to wipe it off before it actually lightened the hairs. Waited a month and tried this...only left it on for the 3 minutes and it didn't seem to remove all the hairs, especially the coarser ones. At that point, my skin was already starting to burn and become red. I applied a cold compress as directed on the instructions and am hoping I don't have to walk around for a few days with this redness. I too did the patch test. Apparently the skin on the upper lip is much more sensitive. Wondering what else I can use now. Guess I might have to try a wax product. Would not recommend."
2,Removes hair-but burns!,"I followed all the instructions, left it on for 5 minutes. The hair wiped away, but then I noticed a lot of redness start to appear. The area is now really red and burning! This is obviously not a good product for sensitive skin!"
1,not happy!,"I bought this (expensive) CD, and it skips badly in several places! I plan to return it, but haven't yet, so I don't know if that will turn out satifactorily or not."
3,Mickey Mouse Musical Watch,I love my musical Mickey Mouse watch. I only wish the music was louder. It is so low that it is barely audible.
3,It was very helpful but outdated.,I recently lived in Colombia for three years and the book was very helpful to know what sites to see in the different parts of the country. However most of the information was outdated.
2,Lacking information on many major cities.,"This guide has interesting information however it lacks many facts and information on a number of cities, particularly Barranquilla. Many facts are outdated and some of the safety points are incorrect. However an interesting read for those wishing to visit Colombia. I am currently writing a Colombian travel guide and would appreciate comments and suggestions from other readers on information they would like to see in a guide book on Colombia. [...]"
1,Useless,"I'm having to go through the refund process, and no one from tech-for-less answers e-mails. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!It doesn't work, and you have to send $20 to mobipocket to use the reader to find out it DOESN'T WORK!!! Useless product.Amazon should be ashamed of this one."
5,Fun Ideas You Can't Keep to Yourself,"There are so many ideas in this book that I've dogeared nearly every page, and my friends and coworkers will have to buy their own copies because I'm tired of lending it out!"
2,"Not many ideas, in my book","Did we buy the same book? I got a (thankfully, used and cheap) copy based on glowing reviews. Yeah, there's lots of pretty pictures, but it wasn't chock full of ideas, in my opinion. The rooms all look ""done"" and expensive. I was disappointed."
3,good,"it seems to stick with one ""style type"" than exploring many different styles, the pictures were great though but sadly not what i was looking for."
2,bike bag,"This particular bag would not fit onto my bike,very disappointing. the velcro seemed to be on backwards? It was hard to figure out and did not include ant directions. No return address was included. This was basically a waste of money and time."
4,Have had other versions...But!,"The vendor was unable to complete order, after the sale! Did process, and do a return of funds in a quick, and timely manner!Which, will cause me to consider this vendor for future sales. They also sent written notice to me, regarding this issue. Not just a e-mail! Which was greatly appericated! Thank You for at least trying to yake excellent care of your customer!"
2,Teken 5 rocks!!,"This game is awsome because the graphics are beutiful and the voicing is awsome as well.Plus the opening movie is so cool I watch it every time i play it.The Devil Within mode is not as cool as the arcade mode,but i still get a kick out of it.I recomend this game to Teken fans,figting fans,Namco fans,and people who can't get anough martia arts!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not my style of fighting game,"I am a big fan of Soul Calibur 2 and before that the Street Fighter series, but this game was disappointing. The graphics are lackluster with inconsistent framerates and the controls are awkward. I found the D-pad control to step toward and away from the screen particulalry frustrating. The game is very similar to Dead or Alive Ultimate, which I also disliked. Try renting to make sure you like it."
2,For ages 9months and under !,"The graphics are cool, not great, the game is not as realistic as older versions, the player moves slower than the normal pace one would expect from a tekken game. I would not reccomend the purchase of this game."
5,the best fighting game ever,"tekken 5 is the best game ever because of the controls, the graphics, the unlockable characters, and the gameplay. the final boss in story mode could have been a little harder though. the doesigners could have also made story mode a little bit longer and more challenging."
5,Still king,"Definetly better than tekken 4, gone back to Tekken Tags way except this is waaaaaaay faster. By the way jinpachi's grave appears in Tekken 2 in Wangs end video. Do any of you know if he is playable in Tekken 5. SPOILER I know heihachi is because he is still alive. The characters range over 30. The only problem is what happened to my fav character True Ogre. Couldnt he come back to life instead of heihachi. Ogre does appear as a boss in Jin's game Devil Within which if you complete once you unlock another background, Devil Jin and other bonuses. If you play it again after completing it you can pick up really expensive customisation items such as the old Devils wings for Kazuya, Angels wings for Devil Jin, Armor Kings mask for King etc"
5,The best fighting game ever!,"This game is great! Reason 1, the characters are amazing! Reason 2, the stages are really cool. Reason 3, it isn't painfully long and boring to get money and characters. The graphics are really good too, especially in the ending videos of the story mode. Overall, I can't see anything bad about this game. If you're thinking of buying it, I highly recommend that you do. If you're thinking that this game would be waste of money, I'd recommend that you think it over."
2,Tekken 5: Nothing new ... maybe even a little dull :|,"I bought Tekken 5 in April and have had it for a couple of months now. I really love the customize option, but the gameplay has gotten dull now. I have all the other Tekkens and now I realize to myself: I know all the moves and what to expect from each fighter, so now all the surprises are gone. The arenas are also boring; you can't even throw your opponents from the tops of buildings or through walls, none of that good stuff.Namco needs to revamp Tekken (I heard they where making a completely new set of characters for Tekken PS3). They need some multi-tiered arenas and lots of new fighters. Hopefully the next Tekken will have this.-Kazami Ami"
1,DON'T,If you like Tekken then don't let your love of the franchise die by buying this game. The response is slow and even on the easiest difficulty it is next to impossible to beat. And this is coming from a gamer who has mastered the previous Tekkens. A terrible waste of money.
5,That was quick!!!,I ordered the game during the week of a holiday and wasn't expecting it to arrive for about 3-4 days. I got the game two days after I ordered it. Talk about awesome service.
5,Great action game.,Tekken 5 is a great game if you're into fighting games. My sons love it. Game was delivered in a timely fashion. Very happy with it. :)
5,LOVE this game!!,I have this game and love it! The game is very fun and the graphics are AMAZING! I have been a fan of the Tekken games since I was a small child in the 90's and continue to love the Tekken series to this day!
3,tekken 5 is a little bit corny,"This is the best game ever, but it's corny, like me. So please god, BUY IT !!! You will be disappointed, but you'll be happy while you're disappointed. My favorite part in the game is when you get to actually fight, but the Tekken games are getting a little old. I mean, come on !! Is there anybody who knows what the heck Tekken means ?? So, the bottom line is that this game is pretty entertaining, especially if you're a Tekken fan. But new Tekken players beware!! Find out what a Tekken is first before you play !!"
5,Great Fighter,"This is still one of the best fighting games out there, but the best way to play this game is to download it through the playstation store and getting dark resurrection online with 1080p supported and of course online play."
3,just another tekken game,"There's only one original thing in this game. DEVIL WITHIN mode, whitch SUCKS!!! it's the same thing over and over again, beating up people and robots with the same combo. I liked the fact that you could play past tekkens, but to me they're all the same. RENT THIS GAME! DON'T BUY IT, IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I stupidly bought it, played it, and got bored within 3 days. I'm returning it tommorow. 2 stars education bucuse it can teach you how to fight, witch isn't neccacarely a good thing, but you can learn a little."
1,Reply back to the crappy pants kid,"If you look in the kids review section, there is a very nasty review about Tekken 5. And now, to the pervert who wrote this review, I'm now talking to you!! First of all, if this game caused your pants to fill up with crap, why did you rate it with 5 stars. Second, dude, don't talk about animal porn. It's da bomb!! And third, did you ever think that anyone was eating while they read your review?? Cuz I was, and my bean burrito went everywhere !!! So please don't write sick reviews anymore !! by The wAy , YouR PunctUation IS Very bAd !!!"
4,Good book for family geneology,"Good book for geneology work. This book had refrences to my family in Eastern Kentucky which I thought was cool. I met the Author at a bookstore here in Lexington, KY and spoke to him about the book."
5,GREAT,"I love this book. In fact I loved researching, writing and illustrating it. I had so much fun that I am writing another book about another courageous woman-Alice Ramsey. In 1909, she became the first woman to drive across America"
4,Lovely Performances,"Michel Schwalbe's performances of these concertos are excellent. He served as concertmaster of Berlin Philharmonic for almost 25 years under von Karajan and for good reasons too. Saint-Saens' concerto is especially brilliant. There are a few intonation mishaps, however they do not diminish or interfere with the beauty of his performance. Tempi are well-chosen and the performances projects a distinct personality. The orchestra playing are not top-notch, but not glaringly poor either. If these performances were done with Berlin Philharmonic under either von Karajan or Szell, orchestral collaboration would have been stronger, however this disc demonstrates the distinguished artisty of Michel Schwalbe. The recording is rather bright, but acceptable."
5,Sturdy and no creases from the hanger.,"I started using these hangers years ago and as my wardrobe grew I needed more of this great item. At first I had purchased them from Walmart, but they no longer carry them. I am so pleased to find them again and I really recommed them. No hanger creases and you can easily select the colors."
2,Jury's out,"The book is designed for the 300. If you own the 350 it borders on annoying. There are footnotes throughout for the 350d at the end of most sections but when you read it like a book top to bottom, left to right it then may end a section with ""this doesn't apply for the XT ..... "" or something similar. This confusion could very simply be overcome with better heading/sub-heading layout for each camera but as it is the main text is for the 300 with the XT as footnotes. I also find the first chapter or two is about the Rebel but majority of the book is just a general photography book. For the price though one can't argue and if you are a beginner I'm sure you'll find something in this book."
3,Good for DSLR newbies,"Originally written for the Rebel D300, this book was updated slightly so to also cover the Rebel D350. It does not include changes incorporated into the new Rebel D400.Most of the book is too elementary to benefit persons who have a fundamental understanding of photography. However, persons with a point-and-shoot background will learn a lot by reading this book. Meaty information about metering and exposure is covered in just a few pages, and that information will be a good review for all but advanced photographers."
3,"Decent basic book, but not just for Rebel","The book is 250 pages long. Of that, the first 58 are specific to the Digital Rebel XT. The rest are for any digital camera (and parts are for any camera, film or digital). There's a 9 page chapter on lenses that use Canons as examples, but, she could have used Nikons with no noticable difference.If you're a beginner and have this camera, then get the book. It is perfect for you.If you already understand depth of field, exposure times, ISO values and so on, then don't waste your money.This appears to be a book that can change the first 50 pages with descriptions of a different camera, then republish it as a new/different book.If you're looking for a book that is well-expanded version of the camera manual get Guncheon's Magic Lantern Guide to the rebel XT (ISBN 1-57990-761-x)"
4,Great help for beginners,"I'm a beginning photographer. I haven't owned a digital SLR in the past, so I really appreciate this book. It's simplistic in it's descriptions without being so much so that someone at a higher level than myself would get nothing from the book. i could see this book being one that I carry around for help...it's well written and gives alot of helpful tips!"
1,Poorly Titled,If you want to learn more about your Rebel read your instruction book. You won't learn anything new about the camera in this book. Its a very pretty book and has lots of instruction on taking better photographs. I wanted to learn more about the camera not about good picture taking technique.At best the title of this book is misleading. It is not a Field Guide to the Rebel. Frankly I'm not sure what it is. Save your money!
4,Short and too the point!,"I loved Denise Austin's video! Her workouts are short-20 minutes, but damn! Those 20 minutes have my heart pumping and the rest of me in a sweat! The moves are relatively simple, and I love the combo of cardio and weights. Great, short spurts of workouts. I loved it!"
4,Denise has a winner here!,"Having worked out to Denise's DVD's in the past, this is another one that really works. I do the whole workout including the ab one and really feel the benefits. Denise as always, is encouraging and easy to follow. Thanks!"
5,Excellent video,This is an awesome video! It really does feel like a boot-camp but it produces great results!
2,Not challenging enough and extra ab workout is repetitive.,"No way this is a 3 week bootcamp. I wish I could sell or return this, denis austin best ab blaster. I did not like it."
2,not long enough,This is not the Denise Austin I have known in the past. Not very motivating or long enough. This is supposed to be a boot camp not a little 20 min. exercise video. Very boring.
1,Not very challenging,I was so looking forward to a new routine but this DVD went back in the box. I've been doing the Firm DVD's for 18 months and they are fantastic. Denise's cueing is terrible and I never even broke a sweat. The ab segment is over before you ever start to feel the work. I was extremly dissapointed. And this may sound catty but the Denise in the video is not the same person that is pictured on the case (by at least 20 lbs).Don't bother!
4,Ok,"I own a lot of exercise DVDs and Denise Austin is way too geeky for my taste. She generally is not a good cuer and her workouts lack real challenge and skill among other things. However, this one is unusally high impact and challenging for her standards. It's not the greatest, but definitely not as bad as most of her other ones. It is very fast paced with lots of cardio. The second chapter is kettlebell based with mostly swings (she uses a dumbbell). Her introductory segment is the same old, freaky eye-raising, goofy voiced Denise, but luckily she loses this habbit in the workout and it is somewhat pleasant to follow. Most of the time she cues late (no surprise), like in the middle of the first move or rep, but if this workout becomes familiar this might not be an issue later. The 4 stars are in comparison with HER other DVDs, not other instructors. She is still light years away from someone like Cathe, Amy Bento, or Kelly Coffey."
4,"Good workout, but not a bootcamp workout","Is there a way to play both workouts together? Great workout when combining both, but you can't play both without playing them individually. No big deal, but a pain to stop. Other than that, good overall body toning and medium intensity cardio workout."
4,Another Denise tape,This too was a gift. My mother enjoyed the other tape so I got her this one too. She uses it alot.
5,GREAT WORKOUT!,I LIKED THIS WORKOUT VERY MUCH! IT IS DIFFERENT FROM DENISE'S OTHER BOOTCAMP WORKOUT. I GOT MY HEART RATE UP REALLY HIGH. I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED DENISE'S PERSONALITY AND ENERGY. I ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT THE WORKOUTS ARE ONLY 20 MINUTES LONG. ITS NICE NOT TO HAVE TO WORKOUT FOR HOURS AT A TIME!
3,So-so,"First, I will admit my bias: Denise Autstin annoys the bageeze out of me. But to her credit, she keeps you moving and these 20 minute workouts are enough to get your heart rate up for a quick burst of cardio. It's impossible to come up with a reason you can't fit this it. I prefer slightly longer, more chalenging workout, but this will stay in the rotation for those morning I press snooze one too many times."
4,GREAT DATE OR GIRLS NIGHT MOVIE!!!,"I loved this movie. Surprisingly, so did my husband. We have date night every Friday night where we just make a salad and a pizza or some popcorn and pick a movie to watch at home. We have chosen this movie 3 times since August. It has a great score, find myself humming parts of it when working. Would be a terrific girls-in-night flick too--many of us could relate to the problems the two main female characters; well played by Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet go through with their men. What can you say about Jude Law--Be still my heart!!! Jack Black--funny and charming as always."
4,Great Music,"Great music to put you in a joyous mood. Makes you want to get up and change your life, live the adventure and enjoy the moment."
4,Wonderful But Missing Movie Songs,"I loved this movie so much and equally love this CD it's absolutely beautiful. I love buying soundtracks after a great movie but I am so frustrated when they don't include all the movies songs after all isn't that why we purchase these Cd's so we can be transported back to the movie. I think they should have to note on the outside of the CD case ""Does Not Contain All Music From Movie"" as it happens so often and this one was no exception as several were missing here to :o("
2,"Music okay, movie soars","While my entire family loved the film on many levels, the music was not as substantial as I had expected. It's funny, sometimes you hear one thing that catches your ear and your mind wants to carry it over to the entire presentation. This is what happened in this situationfor us. While Hans Zimmer's work overall is absolutely fantastic (i.e. Spirit) and is oftentimes soaring in it's rapturous melodies, this one came out rather mundane. It does not detract from the movie, however."
2,Not what I expected,"When I went to see the movie, I was just expecting a cute movie. As I was watching it, I realized that there were really great songs that I hadn't heard before and I walked out of the theater thinking about how I needed to get that soundtrack. I hadn't ever noticed a soundtrack before, so that's how much I loved this one. I went home and purchased the soundtrack online even though I didn't recognize any of the songs.When I came in the mail, I put it in the cd player to listen to it right away. I was super excited to listen to it and then was the huge letdown. All of the songs on the soundtrack are ""scores"" I think they're called. It's not the actual songs from the soundtrack, just the background music. And not that it's just the background music, but every track sounds almost identical! If you are wanting this soundtrack because you loved the song choice in the movie, don't get this because you'll end up out almost $20 and just as disappointed as I am."
2,Complete Letdown,"This soundtrack has ""scores"" only, no original songs from the movie. Quite a shame, because the actual songs in the movie would have made a fantastic soundtrack. If you are looking to buy the soundtrack because you loved the songs in the movie, don't buy the Holiday Soundtrack. You will only get the background music. Snoozefest!I didn't even like the movie, but each time a song would play I would think, ""I have to get this soundtrack!"" Complete Letdown, just like the movie."
3,Relatioship not satifying,"After orphaned Rhawnie was violated by her uncle, Elise and Garth's (from the author's first book SAVAGE SURRENDER) prodigal son Seth helped the ""Golden Gypsy"" to get away. She lived as his unwilling mistress in high society. They got married when she was preganant, then she lost the child. In the second part of the book they spent a lot of time seperated or together but hating/hurting each other. Rhawnie even fancied herself in love and slept with Seth's gentlemanly brother Steven. She could not make up her mind whom she loved until the last minute, and Seth sometimes behaved like a violent brute. The story was written vividly, but it left me with an unsatisfied feeling."
5,True to Life Love Story,Absolutely the best romance novel I've ever read. True to life storyline and characters make this a must read for lovers of the genre.
3,If you are set on a color be careful!,"Its a nice diabolo and works well. The diabolo that shipped was not colored as pictured. Mine was black and white, a surprise I guess. Also when it arrived it was sort of misshaped from shipping although it is a flexible rubber I was able to straighten it out."
2,Bad beads,"Metal bead chains easily just fall off and are impossible to fix. Love the sound, but not the duribility. Happened the first time it was played."
3,Like the Dandy's? You'll like Saturna,"If you're a fan of swirling guitars and power pop, then Saturna will be right up your boat. In the vein of The Dandy Warhols, The Out Crowd, and BJM, you can clearly see their influences. There is nothing earth shattering new, but it is a enjoyable listen."
3,Mejor Producción; Más Aburrido; Más Cansado,"De nuevo con Natalia, si el anterior álbum parecía prefabricado y hecho con demasiada rapidez, espera a escuchar este nuevo. Mantienen sus aires pop, pero mucho más cuidados, las canciones están mucho mejor producidas...por algo será que Ron Fair ha trabajdo en el CD...¿no? Se nota que se ha trabajado más y que hay de todo para todos. Mis recomendaciones son: ""Tu me hiciste ver"" , ""Muero por tu amor"" y ""Hoy Volveré a Cruzar Desiertos"". Escuchad ""Tu me hiciste ver"" entera y entendereis el porque de ese hay de todo para todos ;) Sólo me queda decir; Natalia: ¡Enhorabuena y a por el próximo!"
2,nothing heavenly about this...unless you are already dead!!,"I hate when I buy a cd and there are a few really beautiful songs on it, and then the rest of it just turns maudlin...boring...dull...a waste of time and money! Why do they do that? Why not just give us what we want, and make all the songs glorious? I don't see anything heavenly about this cd, except that it is very quiet!!!"
1,Offensive,I can't give a detailed review of this film because I couldn't finish it. I like mockumentaries but I found this just offensive and tasteless.
3,"Good features, but an annoying buzz when talking","I have had good luck with Panasonic systems in the past. Unfortunately, Amazon was out of stock on the model I preffered. Because of the features, price and avg customer rating (full five stars when I purchased), I gave the Memorex a try. It has many nice features: clear display, easy to use base unit, the ability to use the handset and the base/speakerphone on the same call. The recorded sound was a bit muffled, for both the greeting and messages.The big problem I had was a slight buzz that could be heard when you talked into the handset (not background noise), even after trying every channel and relocating the base. Nothing major, but once you notice it, you hear it all the time - and it gets very annoying. It may have been a defective phone, although I have seen similar comments on other brands. I ended up returning the unit and spending the extra $50 on a comparable Panasonic unit....which has performed very well."
5,Amazingly compact and versatile stool!,"I bought this stool for keeping on my motorcycle (kawasaki klr650) i do extended rides into the middle of nowhere and camp. I wanted to have a small stool to sit on while around my camp fire, this thing is very compact and light. Takes up very little room on the bike and can go into my saddle bags.I takes a bit of getting used to sitting on it, as i did fall over a few times the first few times using it. You just cannot lean in certain directions as it is 3 legged. Once you get used to sitting on it, its not a big deal and i would recommend it for any hiker, camper, or adventure motorcyclist that would like a seat but needs it to be light and small.It is by far the best of its type, very durable, easy to set up and take down, and is well worth the purchase. Go for it already. You wont find smaller!"
2,too strong for my skin,This cream made my face burn. Tried mixing it in with another cream but still felt a burning sensation. I am light skinned and have freckles. Maybe it is better for darker skin. I don't usually have overly sensitive skin and can apply most products.
1,had a reaction,"I dont think this is good for people who have sensitive skin, i had a bad reaction with this, it burned the upper layers of my skin and turned it reddish brown, similar to a sun burn, and now it is scared i went to doctor i have to put steroids and use hydroquinone, i used spf 50 and wore long sleeve protective clothing but still it burned, thankfully i only used it on my arm and back not my face otherwise god help me i would be crying. i dont think this is for everyone it is not safe to put an alpha hydroxy on your skin without consulting with a physician to examine your skin first."
1,I wish i could give this product a zero,"I used this product for roughly say 3-4 weeks. It burns when u first apply it , but after a while its fine, there has been no improvement in the acne scars or dark spots on my face. it gave me some hyperpigmentation around my mouth area and I had to return this product, total junk. I hope my hyperpigmentation fades away. I am really scared to try anything new."
5,Reviva Glycolic cream,I use this product with a Acne regimen and have been very impressed with the results. Will buy again. Thanks Reviva!!!
1,Doesn't work,"I dont recommend that for any body ,, I used it for 3 weeks but I didn't see any effect !"
2,"Feel the burn, but no visible difference my skin","This product definitely contains a fair amount of glycolic acid. You can feel it working right away after you apply it. However, after more than one month of use, I see no visible change in my facial skin whatsoever. The only change I have noticed is that my hands/fingertips are dryer and scalier from using them to apply this nightly, despite the fact that I wash my hands with soap and water immediately after. I'm disappointed."
2,Not very pleased or maybe it's not for me..,"I am a 20 year old african american girl. Okay so I know this product is for acne, your pores or whatever, but I heard you can use this for razor bumps as well and I have razor bumps in my bikini area.. So I tried this applying it as directed before bed.. It didn't sting at all the first time I used I applied it.. and I also applied it on my face. I have a very smooth face with like 1 or 2 small blemishes but it's not big deal.. But I haven't seen no changes.. I started applying this for three days every other day and now I use it everyday! If you apply this after you shave, girrrrrl your s*** is going to be burning!! Lol. Just make sure you apply a moisturizing cream afterwards.. Am I doing something wrong with applying this? I use black soap to shower and wait 30 minutes and then I apply the cream on the affected areas and have seen no changes.. Help!"
3,night cream,a little strong for my likeing. really dried up my skin and lines appeared more visable. I will not re-purchase.
2,Be Careful,"I had been using a 7% that was really not doing much any more so I wanted to bump it up a little. So I did the patch test and had no problems, so I put it on the next night and wore it all night. The next day and for the next week my face was so red and irritated. It was like some sort of weird sun burn that didn't peel, but got very dry... extremely dry. So now I am wearing shea butter trying to moisturize."
5,I'm amazed and I consider myself seasoned with peels.,I am pretty hard core when it comes to acid peels and such. I had been using the Avon peel pads which supposedly has 35 percent glycolic acid. However those pads do not sting like this cream. I must say I am very happy and will continue to use this as part as my day cream. I used the skinceuticals 1.0 retinol at nit. Let me tell you my skin has NEVER looked this good!
3,PETER PRINGLE aka DAVID MURRAY (Anne's little bro),"I don't think anybody's a bigger fan of Peter's work than I am, but this one is not his best work. His 70's radio singles, though criminally overlooked, were pure adult-oriented pop masterpieces - he's far more talented (and a far better singer) than his famous sister, Anne Murray. Unfortunately, no CDs currently exist with Peter's greatest English language hits."
2,"Good sound, but not very convenient","The phone works great, love the conference feature. The biggest downside is that you can only use one phone from the set at a time. So if you have the base unit phone and a couple extra handsets, only one can be in use. If you answer one of the phones and it is for another person, he/she HAS to use the phone you answered. The other phones will not pick up the call. So you have to walk the phone to them even though they might be sitting right next to another handset."
2,Not loving this phone.,"The quality is bad, the sound is very tunnel-like. Speaker phone sound is illegible. The controls aren't intuitive or simple. Bad phone. I should have spent more money on a better phone."
5,Couldn't be more pleased!,"I received this handset, registered the handset in the main cradle and had it programmed and running in a matter of 2 minutes. It operates without a hitch and the hearing and voice are as clear as crystal. This is a very good value purchase."
4,Good Product,Easy to install when adding it to an already existing set. We just needed an additional phone. Sound quality is good. Easy to program memory for phone numbers.
4,GE Accessory Handsets,"I recently purchased a GE Cordless 5.8 GHZ expandable phone system from a local store. When it came time to add handsets, the only place I could find what I needed was on [...]. The handsets were compatible with my current system. They were easy to install and to program to the original system."
1,Display stopped working,Display eventually stopped working on both phones. Just a bunch or garbled text. I would not recommend purchasing this phone.
2,GE cordless phone,"I find the volume of reception varies during a call. I also find the speaker phone volume not loud enough nor constant during a call. Overall, the phone is not quite what I had hoped it would be."
2,It is only ok string,It good sting if you only want three lenths of string. but I would get some of Henrys Yellow string.
4,Good value for Carnipure L Carnitinr,This is a good value for high quality L-Carnitine (180 caps).I'll order again.
4,base + handset review,"Performs well with good range. No answer machine, which I didn't realize when purchased."
3,Range Problems Trump an Otherwise Great Product,"I read the somewhat conflicting reviews about whether range is a problem and decided to purchase the product anyway. I don't live in a big house; nor do I need to use the phone outside. The phone worked fine on the same floor as the base station, but there was an unacceptable amount of static on the other floor and in the basement. I am returning the phone and following the other reviewer's suggestion for the Panasonic KX-TG5566M. If you plan to use the phone in a fairly confined space (less than 1,500 square feet) on one floor it should be a great product. The feature set is fabulous for the price, of course provided you are close enough to the base to avoid static. Otherwise, you might want to consider other models with better range ratings."
4,HOWLIN WOLF - A GREAT STORY,"This was an excellent DVD with some great stories. I would have liked to have seen the Shindig performance complete without interruption, but it was still great to see. As an aside has anyone had a problem with the menu selection for pc interaction. I could not access it. I'd click on it as instructed, but it would only say to put the DVD in my pc (where it already was). Appreciate any help here."
5,Howlin with Hubert,"A fantastic overview of Wolfs career. Given the available footage, its a coherent presentation. I have seen other awesome footage of Wolf playing live, but ownership and copyright probably prevents it all being shown on one film.The interviews with Wolf's long serving guitarist are worth the price alone (although in some scenes it is filmed to look like wolf is playing the solo's).The exchange between Wolf and Son House was an interesting part of the film, but doesnt morbidly dwell on Son Houses condition.Highly recommended."
5,Groove With A View,"A view into the persona of two of the most influential musiciansto come out of the Delta and on to the Chicago Blues scene. Forthat matter the world Blues scene.The relationship between Hubert Sumlin and the Wolf is almost one of pshycic proportion.When they play together the communication is a lock step, they are connected as one groovingunstopable force. AMAZING!Even more amazing is the fact that Hubert is here to nararate thru out this video. Facinating.As a musician aspiring to the Blues and what that means this isa must have for me. And should be for all that appreciate theBlues and understand that it's not just three chords on a guitarbut a living breathing thing that takes your whole being to understand. Will i ever understand it? I don't know but chronicals of this sort sure make it fun to try! And really i've told very little of the surprises that await in this video so get behind it and Enjoy!"
3,Not as funny or thought provoking as Like a Dog on Linoleum,"Saw Leslie Jordan in San Francisco doing his one man show entitled ""Like a Dog on Linoleum"".........was in stitches or tears for almost two hours. ""Pink Carpet"" was good but not as good."
5,Great book for those who like to throw parties,"This book had a ton of great (and easy) recipes and tips on how to make entertaining easy for the host. We always have people over to our house and I'm always looking for new recipes that won't keep me in the kitchen. Also, it has lots of basic information on things like how much ice to buy, how to convert a single drink recipe into a pitcher and so on. The party ideas were kind of themey for my group but you can easily pick and choose what to use. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves entertaining."
4,Great tips!,"Great tips in this book and quite a fun read! Some of the recipes were a little too involved for me, but still something to try when you are not rushed for time. A ton of ideas for working on things ahead of time so the day of the party will be stress free, but most involved freezing the food on cookie sheets until the party. I have a side-by-side fridge and cannot fit a cookie sheet. Such a shame because some of their ideas were quite appetizing!"
2,Turn the Mic Off and Spin,"Very annoying screams from the crowd, and intermittent interruptions from the DJ encouraging the crowd to continue yelling over every track and ""drop-out"", utterly ruins what otherwise would have been a master piece of Techno music. Somebody please tell Carl to turn off the d@mn microphone and spin the records."
5,Very Impressed,"Carl Cox sure knows how to deliver the music the way the people want to hear it. I think Carl Cox is an amazing DJ, and this CD only gives the proof. The CD comes in Bangin' and goes out Pumpin, Carl never misses a beat. He does get on the mic a few times, but I think it adds to the mix, he directly talks to the crowd, he gets them off like no other DJ can.The best part is the remix of ""Be Angeled"" it adds an extra touch, along with the Tracks produced by Carl. I listen to this CD wherever I am, It definantly gets me pumped."
5,best Carl Cox album ever!,"This album is in my opinion the best album Carl Cox brought on the market. The records on this album are the records he played the most in the season the cd came out and most of them are just smashin'. Due to the fact that it's a live recording, it's a very uplifting and lively (dh) cd. Even my friends who don't really like techno like this cd!"
5,Wayyy ahead of his time...,I had this cd for a year or two now and recently decided to pop it in the player and give it another listen. I was truly blown away! Cox was so far ahead of his time and the flow of the disc is fantastic. This disc will make you wish that you could go back in time and be in the club that night to hear this wicked set as it was born.
2,Very Basic Information,If you're very young and just leaving the nest this book's for you. Otherwise you already know all of this and are ready for soomething more advanced.
4,Would be a great book.....,"for someone else, but not me. Just wasn't what I was looking for, but my friend loves it, all the ideas and tips have helped her out, but it just wasn't for me. I would recommend this for anyone who like a modern style and whom has never rented an apartment before, or for any college student. Good book just not for me."
4,"What is it about ""The Memory String""?",This is a story of a young girl named Laura whose mom died three years ago. Her father remarried a lady named Jane. Laura misses her mom very much and she remembers her with a memory string. The memory string has all different buttons wich stand for family memories. The author uses the words very well. Eve Bunting wrote a really good book! Lindsey L.
4,Good Stuff,This is a prety good mask. It does not go all the way around but it does have a good reaction with kids. The tinted eye pieces are a great touch.
3,Miracle in the Rain a Big Wash,"My husband and I watched this movie and enjoyed it until the end -- where it became a big disappointment. They left too many loose ends hanging, and as my husband said, ""The end is cheesy"". It is definately not in character with the rest of the movie which is sweet, and even compelling. BIG DISAPOINTMENT! ""What happened?"" you'll ask. Did they not have enough budget when they made the movie to give it a good ending? Not a movie I'll probably watch again."
4,"nicely done, and memorable","When they say, ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"", this is what they mean, for all the good and the bad that implies. A sincere, beautifully acted and photographed melodrama in the classical style, ""Miracle in the Rain"" should please fans of these things. Jane Wyman is wonderful, and her prayer scene in St. Patrick's cathedral, after her lover departs, is a gem. That the film wanders for a while and takes too many side roads is forgivable, considering the impact and mysticism of the final scene, which fans will remember fondly and which I won't spoil here. The print on this DVD is fine, and the image crisp and sharp (though it looks as if they've used the Lucille Ball ""Mame"" filter on all of Wyman's close-ups). Perhaps it's not all you've heard it to be, but still well worth a look for its unabashed sentiment and stylish presentation. Fans of Wyman's other glossy '50's soap operas should seek this out: it gives the same feeling as ""All that Heaven Allows""."
5,What Love Should Be,I first saw this movie the night of the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. The story was wonderful and I never forgot it. (I was only 15 at the time). I have tried to find in on VHS or DVD over the last ten years and was very happy to find it on Amazon. It's a wonderful love story and one that can and should be watched by all ages.
2,Great music but......................,"I bought this CD because I've long been a fan of Blue Oyster Cult and the music on this CD does not let you down. The major problem that I have with the songs here is the idiotic, stream of consciousness lyrics. The lyrics are so bad that they distracted from the overall enjoyment of this recording. If a competent lyricist had been a contributor to this recording, we could talk about the Stalk-Forrest Group with the same reverence that BOC is discussed. In fact if the lyrics had been better they might not have evolved in to the Blue Oyster Cult."
5,Excellent disc,"Woow, this album is perfect, the music is very good, the sound quality is very very good, Stratovarius is an excellent power band. I recommend this album and this band."
4,Are they microwave & dishwasher safe?,"I purchased 2 of these plates (#1057557) brand new at $4.98 each, seemed a bit high for me. I am a diabetic and find it difficult to visually measure my portions, in particular the carbs. Anyway, thought I'd give these a try. I read the front label & the back of the plate. No where does it say microwave & dishwasher safe. That's very important to me. In reading the reviews I found that some folks state that they do microwave and others state they throw them in the dishwasher. How can I be sure this is appropriate for this type of product? I am with the understanding that, if it were advisable to do so, it would therefore be stated on the actual product? I am in need of some insight.....please!"
1,corelle livingware,not to worry !!! this seller will probably keep this item as wayyyyyyyy too expensive for most folks 3.99 at most places & to include shipping on top .you can do a lot better stay clear .
4,closest to what I wanted,"I was looking for a divided plate for my 94 year old momma. She has trouble when she eats and likes to keep her food separated because she has dificulty seeing what exactly she is eating. I just wish the sides were slightly higher to hold the food. Because it is shallow,it easily spills when she is trying to scoop up her peas, or beans, or whatever. I do like that it has tapered sides as opposed to straight sides. It seems harder to eat out of a straight sided divided plate. I've tried many different kinds, just can't seem to find the perfect one that's also microwaveable. These were a little pricey, thst's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars."
5,great plates,I had been looking all over for these section plates. I had 3 but decided I wanted more because grands do not want food to touch. Dishwasher safe and very durable.Great find.
4,Alvin continues to hone narrative style,"On ""Blackjack David"" , Dave Alvin continues his journey away from rock and roll toward a more folky sound. No longer content to pen modern-day Chuck Berry songs as he did in the Blasters, Alvin has honed a clawhammer acoustic guitar style that provides the perfect setting for his poignant, late-night narratives like ""Evening Blues"" and ""Mary Brown."" Standout tracks include the pensive ""From a Kitchen Table,"" the bluesy ""New Highway,"" and the title track, which is an traditional folk song. ""Abilene,"" with its anthemic chorus, is another winner. Merle Haggard should cover ""California Snow"" and ""Laurel Lynn"" could have been a hit for The Band 30 years ago. Alvin's voice has never sounded better or more expressive, especially on the eerie ""Tall Trees."" While his evolution toward folk might frustrate longtime Blasters fans, the rest of us who are plain Dave Alvin fans can revel in his continued growth as singer, guitarist and songwriter."
5,Compared To......,"Dave Alvin's ""Blackjack David"" is better than any American record since Springsteen's ""Nebraska"" which makes it one of the greatest albums of all-time (in my humble opinion !).A true classic which no fan of this type (or indeed any type) of music should be without . The songs on here cut real deep and may take a while to get beneath your skin but once they do you'll be stuck with them forever. Beautiful music , superb record. PS regarding the ""best since Nebraska"" statement , i meant with the exception of Johnny Cash's ""American Recordings"" naturally !"
2,A bit disappointing,"I really enjoyed the Sadie's got a new dress song, but the rest of the CD was rather unevetful. Not up to Doyle's standard, and definitely not as good as ""Knee Deep in Bluegrass."""
2,Disappointed,"I'm African American and I have very fine,soft, straight hair that doesn't stay curled. My initial idea was to try hot rollers but I don't like a lot of heat on my hair and then I found the Caruso Steam Rollers. I did a lot of research on them, read every review I could find and decided to take a chance since the positive comments outweighed the negative. When I received my pacakage, I immediately tried them out only to be very disappointed in the end reults. The rollers were very easy to put in but left my hair damp, frizzy and the roller caps left behind a very noticeable print. I don't hate the product, it just wasn't made for my hair type but if you're curious about them give them a try because they didn't work for me but they may be just what YOU are looking for! : )"
1,"don't buy it if you have fine, straight hair","I have fine, naturally poker straight hair. I read every review and decided to take a risk on these, and now I'm just out $35. It's an exciting idea--that you can add volume, wave or a little curl without killing your hair. But it doesn't work. I've tried it several times and have plenty of hair to work with (below the shoulders). I'm wondering if this might work better with African American hair or hair that has a little texture. For me, it's junk. Even if my hair complies, the curls work their way out into a kinky mess within an hour. I've read the directions over and over. I've tried finishing with hair spray. Nothing works. Too bad!"
3,Caruso Steam Hairsetter,This product is okay. My only complaint is the rollers do not grab onto the hair and they tend to fall out.
5,Adventure with Jade,"I was very pleased with the Jade Adventure pack that I received, especially at the price that I was able to buy it. I am always happy with the Bratz quality and the Amazon low price and speedy delivery. Thank you amazon. You have a loyal customer."
4,"Lots of colors, not lots of thread","If you expected a large quantity of thread for under $5, I've got a bridge just for you! But if you are in need of a lot of colors for small projects, then this is a deal with 32 different colors to choose from. As far as the bobbins, remember that some sewing machines are quite selective as to what works, so these generic bobbins might not work."
3,Threads and Bobbins,"Lots of colors, but the spools are very small. Great for a starter, which is just what we needed. Thanks!"
2,Overpriced Shipping,"I wouldn't have bought this item if I had noticed the shipping was 64% of the price!!! I bought this item among other items from Amazon so I didn't notice the shipping cost until later. On top of that, it took 13 days to receive!"
4,no work bobbins,I like the array and amount of spools of thread but there's not much thread per spool. Not having to thread bobbins and the amount of time saved doing this made this product worth the purchase. The box it came in is flimsy at best.
1,dont like,I did not expect .... I think it would be better! Would be good if there was a high quality picture for customers!
2,Cheap,The thread breaks alot so I'm reasonably sure it's cheap. The bobbins have a lot more thread on them than the spools. so transferring might be needed. It's neat having lots of colors though.
3,Nice item but cheap holder,"Exactly as advertised works well, thread is decent quality. If you have a better way to store the thread do so because it comes in a cheap plastic holder."
3,it's okay,Not as much thread as i thought it would be. Bobbins are great. So don't expect too much thread with this set.
3,Its Not A lot,But it's pretty good for 64 pieces of thread and it has the basic types of colors. I don't regret buying it because the other kits were more expensive. I also thought the amount would be more but it wasn't but you get what you pay for! I don't mind :) Shipping was pretty good too!
2,don't like it,"my sister bought this for me for xmas. i'm not crazy about them. there okay but you can't talk on both at the same time, which stinks for my kids talking to grandma. they do have alot of static and the range, if you can say they have any, is horriable. i can go farther with my older cordless phone. these i can't even walk outside. my old phone i can go anywhere outside and it works great. i would not recommand these phones. you can get better phones for the same price or less. keep looking."
1,Don't buy this or any similar phone!,"I'm on the second set in one week! I bought a single handset version at Target. Static was unbelievable, where ever the base was plugged in, and whichever phone jack I used. Called Uniden support, twice, and they had me standing on my head, holding buttons, reinserting batteries, and then turning the plug upside down. Returned to Target as defective. Bought a 3-handset at Circuit City the next day, charged it up, and the same static. I've unplugged the DSL, the home security line, everything. Doesn't make a difference. I will always read reviews first from now on!"
1,Terrible phone - not really 5.8 Ghz as you assume,"This phone, and many others in the uniden line are simply terrible. I write this review after having owned many Uniden phones and radar detectors, and am sorry to have have found out that the company let a product this bad slip out. The core of the issue is that this phone is not a true 5.8Ghz phone - part of the transission process is actually conducted in the old 900 Mhz band. Once I found that out, I realized that that was the reason the phone worked worse than any other old cordless I've ever had going back over ten - fifteen years. Uniden support was of no help - they send a canned e-mail after not reading your question, and they don't allow replies to that e-mail. Believe it or not, I am trying Uniden again with a new phone starting with the model number ""tru"" - that is in fact a True 5.8 Ghz phone and I am hopeful!"
1,Want to talk for 55 seconds?,"This phone does not deserve one star, it deserves ZERO. The phone only works for 55 to 60 seconds before the call is cut off. Studied the manual, re-registered the handsets, changed channels and security codes, the works. Called tech support, and they say it must be interference from electronics nearby. Our old phones worked just fine sitting on top of the computer hutch and within a few feet of the microwave (which is where the jacks are, so we had no choice), so why couldn't these? They suggested another room. Ridiculous that we can't have a phone in the family room or kitchen, but we tried it. Didn't work in the bedroom, either. Of course not, there's a CLOCK in there!!! Seems like the phone thinks it's too far from the base (even when you are standing right next to it). Absolutely worthless. I sure hope Home Depot takes this load of junk back! Never again will I buy ANYTHING without checking reviews first, no matter how good the sale price!"
1,Stay Away from this phone,"Like the last reviewer I got this phone at Target for $60 but without reading these reviews first. Big Mistake. It went back the following day! All the reviews are TRUE, Big time static. and no range at all, out in my front yard phone almost was completely useless. Even just in the next room over from the base there was alot of static. If you get a cordless phone make sure it has digital spread spectrum technology not analog. I got a Panasonic kx-tg2431w in its place and it is a thousand times better!"
2,Not a good phone,"I didn't find the range and static quite as bad as other reviews state, but my biggest problem is that the people you are calling can barely hear you. The microphone in this phone must be terrible."
1,This phone was HORRIBLE !!!!!,We owned the Uniden TRU 346 for three years...so when that Phone went we automatically went for another Uniden. We bought this one and it stinks!!!! We live in a one floor ranch 1100 square feet and i cannot go outside either the front nor the back door without serious static!!! I wrote the company and still havent got a response!!!! This phone is NOT WORTH A DIME!!!!
1,"Too Much Interference, Not Enough Range","I received these as a birthday gift just days ago to replace my outdated 25 channel Panasonics. These are NOT a replacement. These are worse!! They have a lot of nice features, but as phones, work terrible!!! Also, as stated before, you may only use one handset at a time!! WHAT????After the initial battery charge of 20+ hours, I installed the base unit and discovered that I couldn't move around at all w/o experiencing static. I couldn't go outside w/o losing the signal, then was unable to reconnect.I have moved the base unit to another location only to experience the same symptoms.I plan to return these if I can. Don't waste your hard earned money on these."
2,range not sufficient,"We have the base station with answering machine centrally located in our kitchen/family room. The cordless range only extends 1 room over, and thus we cannot use the phone 2 rooms over in the office. The cordless range on our previous phone, a Vtech 5831, extended more than two times further.On the plus side, the answering machine is fine and, like the Vtech, this phone does not interfere with our wireless."
4,Uniden DXAI5588-2,"I bought this phone as a replacement for the original one I had. Lightning came in and fried the base on my original one...yeah, should have invested in a surge protector with a phone line receiver. Anyway, I have never had any problems with this phone or the previous one. Clear with no interference. My original phone was probably at least 3 or 4 years old at the time the lightning got it. I was just lucky enough to find one that had been refurbished at a great price. Now I have 4 handsets instead of 2, unfortunately only 3 chargers though. But this was a great phone for the price."
1,Terrible Phone - Constant Static - Extremely Low Volume,- Constant Static - (my old 900MHz phone had no static).- Extremely Low Volume (even when set to Mazximum Volume people can barely hear me and I can barely hear them).- This phone is not useable for us.
1,Do NOT buy this phone! Static is terrible!,Just picked up this phone at Target tonight. The phone & its base had a great style so we were excited to get it. Looked like a great deal for under $60 for two wireless handsets at 5.8GHz. Apparently you do get what you pay for. I hooked the phones up tonight and walked a mere 5 feet away from the base unit and there was already static. Walked 25 feet away and static was very noticeable. I will be taking this product back to Target tomorrow. Not sure how Uniden can sell a product like this with so much static. I should have read the reviews before buying this phone. You have been warned.
1,Horrible phone,"0 stars. Static, and no distance. This is a terrible product. I have had good experience with Uniden in the past, but this is the worst phone I've ever seen. The answering machine is not bad if that is all you want."
1,Is there a worse phone anywhere?,"The only good thing about this phone is if you want to reduce the amount of time you are spending on the phone, because after 30 seconds of trying to talking through the static you will want to get off the phone. DO NOT BUY."
2,Only one at a time..,"The DXAI 5588-2 has many nice features. However, I've purchased many cordless phones in years past and never had a set of 2 that you could not use together. If you are upstairs and your wife takes a call for you downstairs, the upstairs Uniden phone is useless because only one phone can be used for incoming calls."
1,where should I start? it's a BAD phone,"I have gone through three over 9months. Tried different stores and made sure the box was factory fresh.the issues listed are the same for all three.1. extremely POOR voice quality2. low volume3. people on other end of line complain of excessive loudness. so the speaker stinks but the mic is good?4. callerid doesn't allow me to simply hit TALK after receiving a call.so I if get a call from someone, and I scroll through the list of numbers, it does NOT dial correctly cause it doesnt' add the 1. I can't figure out how to add the one through the menu.the phone is junk and will be regifted to someone I hate."
1,Uniden was supposed to be a good name!,"We bought this a BJ's on a 'look at this deal' whim. Waited the 20 hours, and what a disappointment. The static is so bad that it is annoying to bother with a call at all! We tried moving the base around, not moving while talking, everything but standing on our heads! Back to BJ's it goes and I think next time I'll check Amazon reviews first!"
1,Terrible Reception - Lots of Static,"This is my 1st review. We currently have an older EXS 9600 from Uniden and it is a great phone. It's about 6 years old, dropped occasionally and still working great. But this new Uniden is not like the older models. My wife bought this thinking it must be a good phone because it is from Uniden. How wrong. The reception starts to cut out walking from one room to the next. And don't even consider walking out to the back patio or into the garage, there is nothing but static. We are going to try another Uniden model recommended in Consumer Reports. It is the DXI7286-2, $39.99 from Amazon. We will write a review on that phone in a couple of weeks"
2,Like static?,"This phone has some good features. The handset size is great, the flexibility of the 2nd phone without needing a 2nd phone jack is wonderful. However, I can't believe all the static they have. Every slight movement of my head caused a great deal of static. I'm also a bit leery of the phones since they are analog 5.8 Ghz rather than digital. This means that security is much lower than a 5.8 Ghz Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS) system.I'm returning mine as soon as possible. Good ergonomics is wonderful, but the static isn't worth it. Uniden used to be the best major manufacturer of phones, particularly cordless, but their quality has fallen significantly."
1,Worse... Phone.... cccccccchhhhhhhhh... EVER!,"Do you like static? Do you appreciate not hearing the person on the other end of the phone? Is your house smaller then 10 square feet? Then this is the perfect phone for YOU!However, for the rest of us, this phone is pure garbage. The base unit was on our 2nd floor in the office, and the second unit was on the first floor due to us having a PC phone service. Using this phone was a nightmare. There was a ton of static due to the short range of the phones, and the voice quality was below average at best. I returned this within a week for a Panasonic model, and it works 1000x better.Do yourself a favor, stay away from this terrible product."
3,Missing Hobbs...,"This CD is ok, but the band just hasn't been the same since they lost Mike Hobbs, their original drummer. He was the best!"
1,Paulie Latex I Love you!,Hobbs is okay but Paulie Latex is the hottest hottie in scrumliliciousville. This CD Stinks though. No songs about killing presidents or sleezy LI pizzerias.Latex Generation is Extra Long In A Tree
5,No Chatter,"These countersinks are great. When using most countersinks, even in a drill press, you typically get some chatter that results in a countersunk hole that has five ridges radiating from the center. It looks like !@#$, and the flathead screw will not properly seat in the hole. This countersink set seems to be a little expensive, but well worth it when trying to make high-quality products from wood."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"I have already sent one review of this product, but here is another. This product is totally worthless and I am surprised Amazon sells it on their web site. One leg ripped out the first time my wife tried to put it on. I will never buy anything from Leg Avenue again."
4,Discovering passed and future,I enjoyed reading about the lives of the Hanlons and how it all ended in the future. I thought it was good reading.
5,Stunning Photos!,"Of course, everyone loves the feisty, peppy hummingbird with it's glorious colors. This book shows details that the average birdwatcher never sees. The close up photos, some in action sequence, are a delight and there are pictures even showing the nests made of cobwebs, feathers and lichens.The text supplements the photos giving details of the author's observations on hummingbird behavior.One section covers the different hummingbirds, giving each variety a two-page spread. There are several photos plus a listing of the field markings, range, breeding range, winter range, nesting, migration and habitat for each.Additional graphics are quite useful, like the one showing the names for the body parts of hummingbirds. What a useful (and beautiful) book!"
4,Handy,"Easy to use and handy to get words, sentences, etc. When I purchased this software, it was regular price, $30 so a bit pricy. Other than price, it was OK. Good for ESL. I used with MS Word and I have Win XP home and Office XP Pro. No problem with my OS."
3,Doug of BR,"Good product, but has no power button. On standby always with display active. Have to take batteries out when not used of long time."
3,You get what u pay for,"The sound quality isn't the greatest, and you cant connect it to the computer to transfer the files. as a result u have to delete the files every week to make up room. Buts its cheap and it has different files to use for different class."
1,Don't waste your money,"Buyer beware. If it's cheap, it's cheap. First let me say that I did not purchase this through Amazon as I had an immediate need and could not wait. It was the only unit I could obtain locally. Battery life zero. You cannot fast forward...nothing like listening to an all day meeting all over again just to pick up a few key points...If you accidently stop it rather than pause it, you go back to the beginning! No thought went into this unit."
2,Inadequate battery life,"The product is advertised with ""408 recording hours"". After opening the package and using it I found fine print that states ""battery life 16 hours for recording and 10 hours for playback"". This requires 26 battery changes. Time for a refund."
1,No Clue How to Use This,"I did not buy this here, and mine claims 288 hours of use (but reading reviews I guess I have to take out batteries?)In any event, I read the little instruction book but it is simply not understandable. I have no clue how to use this.I need one of these, but I also need instructions with use information.This is going back."
1,Item sucks. Don't ver buy it!,"Can't link it to m pc. No matter what you record, it stays only there in the recorder. Regret at the first time I try it. Call for a refund but get totally ignored."
3,It does its job.,"Granted, I was no longer in the state of mind to do anymore shopping,so I bought this recorder in the ""last resort"" mindframe. The positive, it does have decent sound quality and the design is practical however,its inexpensive feel reminds me of a toy model and for the price you could definetly find a recorder with more features (i.e. PC compatible,more storage) and within the same price range. If you are looking for the basics,then there are still better prices around; either way I wouldnt recommend this model, it doesnt quite live up to its looks....and yes,I will be in the line for Returns."
4,A Rare Treat for Rockpile Fans,"All you need to know is that tracks 1-7 find Mickey backed by the 1978 lineup of Rockpile -- Dave Edmunds, Nick Lowe, Billy Bremner, Terry Williams. 'Nuff said really."
5,Earthy and delightful,"Picked this up just the other day in a used-CD store. I hadn't heard of even one of the artists, but I am a sucker for pretty packaging, so I decided to take a chance.I'm in love! Tracks like ""Missione A Bombay,"" ""Cadence,"" and ""Sigh"" are all perfect for easy-listening...in fact, this relaxed me so much that I used it last night to help me get to sleep. The name ""Earth"" is quite apt for this part of the series--every track made me want to put down roots and dance at the same time. I would recommend this to any easy-listening, new-age, world music, or jazz buff.If the rest of the series is half this good, I'm buying all of them."
1,Waste of Money,I do not recommend this product regardless of your circumstances. It is very overpriced for what you get. The material is very basic and merely consists of roughly 15 pages of paper stapled together and a lame cassette tape. I was very disappointed in this product and recommend that anyone considering purchasing this product just save your money and get something else. You could get the same if not better information simply by going to a search engine and looking at free online material.
4,Beautiful Piano!,"The piano looks gorgeous in my daughter's room. The legs are not as sturdy as I was hoping so I will be having someone come by to fix that. The sound of the keys is a little different than I was hoping but sounds ok while playing a song. Overall, we were pretty satisfied with the piano for the price we got for it."
3,Just OK,Got this for our granddaughter for Christmas a couple of years ago. Cute to look at but takes up quite a bit of space. Tinny sound. Doesn't get played with much.
1,Review of piano,I am very disappointed with this purchase - especially considering I paid over $200 for this item. The sound quality is incredibly poor and the song book which accompanies the piano is full of errors. Would not recommend this piano at all unless was priced for under $30.
2,just plain bad,"wow. this game is awful. i rented it to compare it to the xbox version. ooh. that wasn't a good idea. the graphics are nowhere as good, the gameplay is terrible. ps2 got gyped on the online play as well. no co-op. i don't know if either ubisoft is just lazy, or don't know how to utilize the ps2 hardware. i'd stay away from this game. i recommend ghost recon jungle storm. it's more fun & better online."
1,HUGE LET DOWN!,GHOST RECON IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES. THIS GAME AND GHOST RECON JUNGLE STORM ARE PITIFUL IMITATIONS OF THAT GAME. I PAID LESS THAN $4.00 FOR EACH OF THEM AND THEY STILL ARE NOT WORTH THE PRICE I PAID. BUY THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.
1,this game was a waste of money.,"the graphics are ok, but that's about it.it's way too hard.i started out on normal difficulty,couldn't get 2 minutes into the first level,so i have reduced it to recruit difficulty(the easiest) and still cannot get past the first level.my idea of fun isn't playing a level 50 times before i can get past it.there is no health and no saving...you can't pick up extra weapons-- you can only trade yours for your enemies dropped ones-- it seems incredibly linear like R6 lockdown-- that game isn't that great either.i have the first 'conflict desert storm' game and it is better than both GR2 AND R^ lockdown!!!i don't think i'll be buying any more clancy titles--"
3,it was ok,"the graphics are very good but ur teamates dont fire unless you start fireing you can command them to throw grenades, fire regroup, or hold position. your health drains down fast. and when i told them to throw grenades it rolled back down the hill and killed them including me if you want to buy it go ahead but it isnt that good"
2,Too Hard,"This game (...). Its very hard and the camera angles are annoying. I got to the 3rd level and then i gave up. The missions are long and you cant save. Even if you liked Ghost Recon, Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm or any other Tom Clancy game dont get this."
3,ghost recon fans////.......stay away from this game!,"This game is a waste of money and time , i was so upset when i fist tried this game i was excpecting a much more realistic gameplay expirience like the first ghost recon , the grafics are quiet impresive though but no more fear no more tactical gameplay like in gr 1 , you cannot use stealth to try to get as close as posible tothe enemy no matter how quiet you try be be , there is nothing realistic about it at all ,you cannot switch between soldiers, you can take like 8 shots before you are death , the enemy death animations are just ridiculous , no blood in the game , when you try to crouch or prone position it happens so slow ,if you liked the first ghost recon dont get this game thrust me ."
4,pretty good,this game was pretty good. i really liked the graphics and the controlls were easy. the only bad thing was your teammates. they rarely fire and almost kill 1 out of every 4 people you kill. the missions were long and u couldnt save but it was easy so i thought who cares f u cant save in a mission. this was the best shooter game i played but if you dont like this one i suggest halo or medal of honor thoes were also great games but this was AWSOME!
2,Socom is 100% better,"If anyone ever compares the Ghost Recon series to SOCOM they are completely insane. SOCOM is so far and away the better game, Ghost Recon 2 is so linear it forces you to play every mission the same way. Your teammates are useless and will actually grenade themselves more often than not. At least in SOCOM they would follow your orders once in awhile. Ghost Recon just has you in front all the time getting shot at while they wait behind. You're forced to run into ambushes constantly and you can't leave certain sections of the map to try different attack angles. There are invisible walls set up to keep you trapped like a rat. Please pass on this series and stick w/ SOCOM 1, 2 or 3"
3,It's not all that bad.,"Now, I gotta say, this is the first Ghost Recon I've ever played. So it's hard for me to compare it to the rest of the series (except I've seen Advanced Warfighter, and I was not impressed). I had a fun time playing the game the first time around, but the re-play factor is not so great. I like the realistic approach to the weapons and tactics of war as displayed by this game. I also like how you can't survive this game by the stupid run and gun strategy that most first person shooters allow you to use. The graphics were pretty good, too. So this definitely is not the ideal game, but it isn't all as bad as some make it seem."
2,..Horrible,"Wow! This game looks great! When it comes out i've got to buy it!Yeah, the commericals made this game look way better than it is, it almost was made to look better than SOCOM II...Well, awhile back I rented this game to give it a shot. I absolutely hated this game fromt he start. Here are the reasons: Totally unacceptable loading times, they litterally take up to 2 or 3 minutes each time. The camera view: the angle you play your character at is horrible. Its like you are playing over his shoulder, and it's just really hard to control him. Also bad thing about this game is how the map is useless and doesn't tell you how to complete the missions, so you have to use your head.Don't buy this game, as a favor to me and you're well earned money."
3,Nice Game,"I thought this game was pretty good. They improved the Graphics, and made the AI and Sound Better. But that 3rd person view was annoying. There were times when i tried to make a shot but my Character's head kept blocking my veiw, so then when i moved around to get my head out of the way I got shot, or killed.Your squad was very bad, They couldnt hit a barn if they were standing next to it. How could someone they say is and expert Marksman have less kills at long range then the person with the assualt rifle.So to sum it all up, its a good game with the improvements, but it has a lot of downsides that lower my rating."
1,A disgrace to the Ghost Recon series,After playing and loving the original Ghost Recon games I expected this game to be just as good if not better. Boy was I sadly mistaken. Although the graphics may be good thats the only thing the game has going for it. Simple actions such as commands or zoom become too complicated and your team mates might as well not even be issued guns since they hardly use them. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Maybe if you want a night of utter frustration go rent it. It also makes a decent frisbee.
1,Ghost Recon 2,Very Disappointing..... Nothing like the original. I can't believe I wasted my money.NO OFF-LINE MULTI-PLAYER !!!!!!Don't make my mistake. Stay away from this game if you liked the original.
4,okokokokok it wasn't that good,"All right GR2 wasn't the best game but don't let thoes whiny teenagers sway your opion. see the game gets kind of hard durring the lone wolf missions. but GR2 does have its good parts. theres an all new 3rd person mode and the graphics have improved imensly. you can order your men and/or weman the sieas fire, attack, even through graneds! I think its a really good game. the cons are big in size but don't happen very many times throught the game. theres no more swiching characters but everything eles makes up for that. theres a new adoped RB63 fireing way. you hold a button down and pick your wepon or firing choise/troop movement. but don't let that dissapoint you its accualy easer to use. so durring the heat of battle you can easily swich from you SAW to graneds with the touch of a button. all i'm saying is this game is an awsome game i say buy it if you want it"
5,PlayStation2 Star Trek: Conquest,PlayStation2 Star Trek: Conquest - I bought this as a gift and have had no reports of there being a problem.
5,great game,Has excellent graphics and came in great condition for a very low price it is a must have
2,Boring.,"Just boring. The same old, same old. The author continues to churn out pages of the same thing over and over again."
2,Slow developing and boring,"I loved all her other novels, but this one was very slow and boring. The characters spend to much time thinking and analyzing the same things. There was little plot or character development until the second half of the story. Once the plot opened up, it dragged on to a slow resolution. I not longer cared about the story. I did not get the characters. The fantasy romance stories were not very enticing and almost fillers. Once her secret was revealed it lacked any surprise. All rather anti-climactic."
3,bitter disappointment,"While this a lot better in characters and storylines than the fourth one was, the fourth one actually had a believeable love storyline. This one was just a joke and you could tell by the end she was trying to make up for the lack of it and i for one didn't buy it. Seducing is one thing, making the whole romance sex though is not love, its lust. there's a differenceI know that all that is needed but sex is like half the book, there was little or no courting and then in the end the heroine couldn't even say the word love. The whole point of a romance is for them to fall in love, whether you believe in the concept or not. But overall, yes this was a comeback from the fourth edition and I will read the whole series just cause I'm dying for Dalziel's story but she has completely lost her touch.Once I could feel the love and now its not love, its ""equal partners"". good concept but seriously romance category means love and hey if use sex but dont make it the whole relationship."
2,"Disappointing, not distracting","While I've enjoyed Ms. Lauren's works in the past and was looking forward to another installment in the Bastion Culb series, this book was a definite disappointment. The hero was interchageable with the heroes in her previous books and the heroine, despite her unusual occupation, was weak. The book would have been helped by some judicous editing as the story seemd to drag throughout, picking up only in the last few chapters. As always, the romantic scenes between the characters were sensual and well written but, again, they were pretty much the same as the scenes and the progression in her previous books.Although I enjoy rereading the books of my favorite authors, this one definitely won't be read again and only my curiosity about the identify of Dalziel is likely to cause me to read another in this series."
2,This is boring,"I'm forcing myself to read this one, even doing so; I've stopped reading three times to read something else. I keep hoping something exciting will happen; how long can you do that? I was looking forward to another book in this series, some banter & strong chemistry between the couple -- surrounded by danger, mystery, and bad guys. I wanted to visit or revisit other gentleman in the club. I don't know if I can finish this though, it's just so dull."
2,Not Even Worth Reading Through Anymore....,"I used to be a huge fan of Stephanie Laurens....(I've read every one of her books....) She used to be 1 of my most favorite authors, but I'm really sorry to say that she's not any more....(In the few recent yrs., I've simply been reading all of hers just bcs. I've gotten into the habit of it, not bcs. they R as sensual & intriguing as they used to be anymore....)This book started out interestingly enough in the beginning, but it all went downward very quickly after the first several chapters, & finally, the story got so-o-o-o boring after I read through about half the book that I ended up just skipping through most of the later half of the book to finish reading this book after reading just the last few chapters....(I used to buy everyone of SL's new books, but I do believe that these R no longer worth buying & no longer even worth reading through.... Truely sad, but true....)"
1,More apt title: The Sexual Escapades of Phoebe and Deverell,"I've read a few of Lauren's books in the past. Though certainly the sensuality level of her books is higher than those that I typically read, without a good plot and flat characters, the physical relationship isn't enough to hold the reader through a book.The main component that ties the story together is the sex. There's so much sex in this book that the title should have been ""The Sexual Escapades of Phoebe and Deverell. I don't have a problem with a sensual book, but because the characters were not very appealing, I found all the sex to simply be a distraction. If I at least had the feeling that Phoebe and Deverell cared about each other, besides the amazing sex, I would have been more convinced.I'll be hoping for better next time."
3,Not Distracted,This story of a woman who has made her decision not to marry is not a new one. It has the hero simply ignoring her decision and pressuring her to change her mind. The story was slow at first but I kept at it and the last part was much better. I guess I just don't like pushy people. I didn't like it as much as her earlier books.
3,I WAITED A WHOLE YEAR FOR...,"I've really enjoyed the Bastion Club books...maybe with the exception of A Lady of His Own. Anyway, I've waited a longtime for this book to be released only to be just a little disappointed. The plot was okay but it took a while to really get into the grit of things. So why almost 500 pages? Sex---plain and simple. I enjoy reading a steamy novel just as well as the next person does but this book had more sex than story.I waited a whole year for...disappointment? Not quite but I have a lukewarm feeling on this latest Bastion installment.I think I'll send my purchase to the used book store just like I did with A Lady of His Own."
2,struggled to finish it,"I am not a usually a stickler for historical accuracy, but this novel crossed barriers I didn't even know I had. A Regency era lady whose family turns a blind eye to her lover sneaking into the house every night??? Please, it was just over the top. I am done with Stephanie Laurens after this book. Her early Cynster books are wonderful, but I have found the Bastion series uninspired."
3,It dragged! Her books are usually so good! Not Here ...so slow for story to build!!,"LOVE Stephanie Lauren books; I have read them ALL!!! But this one is so, so slow; it takes forever for the story to build. Pages and pages saying the same thing and so predictable. Makes you wonder if an author gets paid by the page. If you like reading about one kiss for 3 pages, this is your book. If you want that kiss mixed with a solid story, perhaps this is not the book for you. Still a good story though you can easily skip pages and not miss a thing."
3,Laurens needs to try something different,"There's no question that Stephanie Laurens is a good writer. In years past, I would eagerly await her books and devour them quickly. But, these days, they all seem alike. This is a competently written story, but the ""intrigue"" is pretty blase. Her characters aren't that different from every other hero and heroine she's created in the past. And the plot is stretched 100 pages too long. ""To Distraction"" isn't very distracting. I'll try not to give up on her, because there are fewer and fewer good writers concentrating on the Regency era. Here's hoping she can create better characters and plots in the future."
2,Not Eco-Friendly,"I bought this rug because I was looking for something that was not harmful to me or the environment. While the rug is pretty, it contains a padding made of PVC which is not pleasant or healthy to inhale. It had a strong odor when I pulled it out of the box and so I am sending it back. If you don't care about this then by all means buy the rug because it looks very nice."
3,Mountain Bamboo rug,The rug was well made and arrived in a nice storage case. The color looked good but all the color faded out of the rug when I placed it outside on my deck. I would not recommend it for outdoor use.
5,Great Rug!,"What a fantastic rug. I use this rug at my door and it holds up in all the weather. Very easy to clean and light enough to move around if you want to. Beautiful color, the picture doesn't do it justice. The rug has a fantastic green hue and wonderful non-slip back. Well worth the money."
2,Buy the regular edition instead,"This is a great album, but the ""limited edition"" does not have enough features to warrant paying an additional $6. You get two bonus tracks, and that's about it. The free multimedia content on the Fischerspooner website far surpasses what's on this CD.Very disappointing. Nothing on par with the limited edition DVD that was packaged with their previous release, #1. The album rates a 4 or 5, but I'm giving this a ""2"" to steer people toward the regular edition of this disk."
2,Didn't live up...,"I was a huge fan of their first album...it was groundbreaking in many regards. I was very excited when this new CD came out so I set the mark too high. Odyssey was a let down in many ways, the biggest being they used the same vocal effects for almost every song. There was no variety in the synths either... There are a few songs that are alright, nothing up to the standards of #1 Enhanced though....buy at your own risk."
1,Waste of money,"Do not waste your time, money, or hearing with this god-awful tribute CD. Sean McLaughlin (whoever the heck that is) attempts to channel Scott Weiland but comes off sounding like a strangled chipmunk.If you want to hear classic STP songs, go pick up Core and Purple."
1,Maybe if I were drunk...,"I don't know anything about whoever is singing/playing on this album, but I don't think they had any business covering greats like STP. It reminds me of when local bands try to cover Plush in small, smokey bars and fall very very short."
2,"Pretty good, but there are definitely better resources","The long overdue book from the author of Welcome to Macintosh Multimedia (in 1994, a dragon's age ago in the computer industry) sets up projects and attempts to establish knowledge through ""doing."" It's pretty good, too, but in the end you know how to do the projects laid out nicely in the book and on CD-ROM. Much less effort was expended to guide someone in a complex endeavor that might use necessary skills and resources that this book should have taught. No doubt Mr. Neuschotz knows what he's doing; it's just disappointing that this book doesn't help others a little more to get to that level of skill or confidence."
1,Otherwise respectable arrangements ruined by insipid female vocalists,"On *every* track. The same group of insipid female vocalists, miked down so that you have to strain to hear what they are singing in order to give Monk the lead spot. Give this one a miss."
2,Disasterous and boring,"The Disasterous Mrs. Weldon, The Lives, Loves, and Loves of a Legendary Victorian, follows the life of Georginia Thomas Weldon, an infamous lesser-known celebrity of the Victorian era. Of course, to hear the story from her point of view, letters, and autobiography, you would think the world had revolved around her. She used her feminine wiles and talents, so to speak, to advance herself in society. She moved from disasterous affair and situation to even more disasterous situation with no consideration to the havoc she left in her wake. At one point, unable to deal with his wife any more, her husband petitioned to have her committed. In a stroke of sheer luck, she was able to challange the standing law regarding marriage and property and claim a victory. This book was sparked by the author reading the six volume autobiographical embellished explaination of her life penned by the real Mrs. Weldon. Thank heavens this was a single volume."
2,a little dry...,"i wouldnt use this in a personal ministry or anything. i've read alot of outreach guides in this vien. dry, sleepy, boring."
1,Not what I expected,"These are not large. At all. And they aren't what I would call organic either. The earrings are very shiny and appear uniform; although if you look very closely you MIGHT notice the small difference in the shape that allows the adjective ""organic"" to be applied. One of the earrings has the 925 stamp on it and it is very visible because the metal is so thin. This makes them look cheap. Overall, they are boring, unsubstantial and conservative looking. I can't imagine I will ever wear them but don't want to waste my time returning them either. I am annoyed that I made this purchase."
5,A Terrific Read,"Fabulous book. Part travel, part history, part meeting of two cultures, the author lays it all before you with a delightful sense of humour, a discerning eye, and a sincere respect for the people of Melanesia. It opens up a window to a world most people know nothing about and are unlikely to ever encounter. For me, as a frequent visitor to that part of the world, it was wonderful a trip down memory lane."
3,Erudite,"If you're looking for a good, fun animal guide/dream book, this is NOT your book. If you're looking for an expansion of Jungian theory and some self-agrandizing from the author, you've come to the right place."
2,Unimpressed for price,"I am a professional remodeler. I ordered this bag as an organizer for my fasteners, drilling and driving gear. I shelled out the 50 dollars due to the rave reviews, but was disappointed in the overall build of the bag. The weight of the nylon was not as heavy as my Bucketboss bags, and the removable top tray was remarkably thin and flimsy. I expected a heavy polyethylene (or similar) tray - like a high end standard toolbox. Instead it felt like HDPE (milk jug) plastic. I was not at all confident it would hold up to daily wear and tear. Also, the bag itself is very soft-sided, which made getting the tray in and out quickly quite difficult."
5,splendid!,"I am a big fan of Bronn Journey's. I have almost all his cd's and this Christmas Rose is my favorite. I am giving it for gifts this year. Get it if only for ""Little Drummer Boy"". It's magnificent."
4,Great song,"First, this is a two track single not three. Track one is the radio edit and two is without the vocals. It would have been nice to have gotten at least one remix but the song itself is pure pop. If you liked the A Teens you will certainly like this too."
1,Draw,"It's ok, but why can't they show you how to draw women that aren't trashy?I would like to see a ""how to"" book that shows how to draw real fighting woman and what they would look like not an over-inflated,weak, want to be Barbie. That couldn't get out of her own way."
4,This book is full of outdoor information.,This is a fascinating book to read because it describes outdoor techniques that are dated but still quite applicable. I found the section on making skis quite interesting and plan to build a pair.
3,An Okay Book,This book is about a world-class gymnast named Heidi Ferguson....And she's in the hospital-but why? She dosen't seem very sick. Read the book to find out what's wrong with her.
4,Visually awsome,"This book was designed extreamly well. The book consists of emails, faxes, photos, sketches, CAD, essays, and much more in a scrap book fasion. The whole thing is talking about this project for the Expo, but that isn't what is interesting about it. The design of the book allows you to page through and look at the pictures, read snippits of emails or faxes, and shows you their process of concept and design. If you were to ignore the fact that it is all talking about this one project you can use it to inspire new ideas for your own use. This is one hell of a book. The copy i go was a slightly different version but the inards are essentially the same."
1,the good against the bad,"diller & scofidio are the best. and everyone has to know it. so read the book and support them on their fight against the rest of the bad, bad world. you can manipulate every fact that it fits your purpose, but sometimes it's too transparent for mature people, probably this book would work as a fairytale for children."
5,DONT BUY,THIS SCANNER IS GREAT BUT WAL-MART SELLS THIS SAME EXACT 200 CH NASCAR UNIDEN SCANNER FOR 99.00 JUST A HEADS UP! :)
5,great extra mixes and music videos at a great price!!!!,"This is a great CD/DvD to get it has alot of great Jennifer Lopez music videos from ""If you had my love"" to ""I'm Glad"" a must for JLO fans, also a great one to get for new people.I LOVE LOVE IT and its at a great price!Also,on CD side love R.kelly mix of ""Baby,I love you"" as wellPaul Oakenfold perfecto mix of ""I'm Glad"".excellent a must!"
5,Must see Jennifer Lopez Albums.............!,"This Jennifer lopez's dvd is really very good....as it contains videos of her albums, audio songs as well as you can see Jennifer lopez's conversation among these videos, in which she herself tells about the making of each video album.Following are some videos which I liked the mostIf you had my love....Baby I love you.....No me ames....Love don't cost a thing...."
1,sucks,i used to buy some of her cds but after seeing how her fasion line supports animal cruelty and killing endangered species for fashion makes me sick...i saw all her video on jlodown.com...she is an aweful person...and she was rude a radio interview where she hangs up on the DJ for giving her knowledge about whats she is doing and thats is just plain immature of J-LOW..... her cd is aweful...not even one song was good... her fans are bazarr too.... they even support her cruelty in animals....i used to be a fan until she slept around with everyone and and steals usher and mariahs music...this woman have no dignity or self respect....she is a thief ...and her career will end up like paula abdul...here today gone tommorow..
5,The reel J.Lo........,DVD-.-Amazing package.-DVD with every video from Jenny.-An exelent quality in the video(crystal clear video).-Dolby Digital 5.1 Sound (well mixed)-Funny commentaryes from J.Lo-Exelent photos and info from her prev albums in the DVD.CD-.-Great remixes-Exelentsound too.-Fav. track : Baby I love U! remix versionadd me to your MSN to talk about J.Lo. cftremor@hotmail.com
5,"""Baby, I Love This..."" (The Reel Me)","This dvd/cd is absolutely stunning. The song ""Baby I Love U"", is such a great song that should get more airplay. But, besides that, the dvd is definetely a must own for J.Lo fans, and, still, can be enjoyable if your not one. And, if your not satisfied with the dvd, just switch to the cd that you will surely love...... All the remixes are brilliant, and great dance toons. Plus, people will gat a nock-out experience after they hear the ""Baby I Love U remix with R. Kelly"". Trust me. Go and buy ""The Reel Me"", I highly recomend it. You'll thank me later, after ""Baby I Love U"" gets stuck on your head fopr about a week!!!!!!!!!"
4,Worth the price!!!!!!,"There is not too much to complain about this DVD\EP from Jennifer Lopez. As mentioned already, all of her videos are on the DVD along with commentary. And as we all know, you can't get enough of J. Lo dancing in a video. The DVD alone is worth the price you pay. Although I was a little dissapointed with the EP remix CD, it is a nice addition to the package. All of the songs are remixed from her latest CD. I don't know why Baby I Love U the album version is included though. Basically out of the 5 remixes (not counting the album version) most are club remixes that are generally OK. But the last track, Baby I Love You (R Kelly remix) is really HOT! I would almost pay the price of this package for that one song! It's really awesome, of course it's because R Kelly is a genius (Pied Piper of R&B!!!!!!!!!!)"
2,2 out of 4 ain't bad,"Project 86- self title, awesomeProject 86- drawing black lines 2 good songsproject 86- Truthless heroes, awesome a must own.Project 86- songs to burn you bridges- disappointing.There are one or two songs here worth listening. But what a disappointment.If you don't have the first CD or truthless hero's your money is better spent there."
1,Do Not Buy,"This heater, at least when operated in a golf cart gives off fumes that severely irritate eyes and lungs. We can operate it for at most 1/2 hr. before having to turn it off. Try another model."
3,Running With the Whole Body,"This book has some very sound advice for improving your running technique. Sadly it is presented in a very dated format. The pictures need updating and the exercise explanations aren't as clear as they could be. The case studies at the end of each chapter are interesting, although the author does come across as a touch self congratulatory at times. Overall a good book for those who have many other books on the topic, but not an outstanding read or for those who are new to running.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Love it!!!!!,I love both movies and was thrilled to find the original music. It's amazing...LOVE IT!!!!!!
3,Very enjoyable.,"The arrangements of the songs are pretty accurate in relation to the originals done by Richard Carpenter. The singer who performs the vocal version is very nice...good voice...but alas..she is NO Karen Carpenter! :) Essentially, it's a good cd and enjoy listening to the gorgeous intrumental tracks...the music of the Carpenters is beautiful and those who produced this cd certainly did right by Rich and Karen."
4,Thou Shalt Shudder ...,"ohhhh..this is funny! I mean we hear about fundamentalists often referring to Muslims. This is about Christian doing their conversion on these 'noble savages' who live in their caribbean beauty. I am not saying more about the narrative than that, read it. I honestly think that only somewhere like Trinidad produces writers like this who grow up in a country where, like Sevlon you can be 'bitter sweet', and I did not feel anything real real bad was being said about the christians (half my family are Prods). Sharlow is delivering this book, about one pompous prodestant group (from the US instead of the UK) that wants to change another group (Trini Hindus, Mulsims etc) BUT who really honesty envy them on another level. But enough ... I just wanna say, I laughed and laughed all the way to buying 3 copies for friends (A Christian, A Hindu and a Muslim).Zeech"
4,Another well-written book by Gail Bowen,"Mysteries do not need the detailed ""blood and guts"" that we get from so many authors these days. Gail Bowen's writing style lets you be part of the scene . Well written, as are all of her books. If you want more than just pulp fiction, read her series."
3,"Good for short, stubby fingers on large hands...","This is a pretty typical ""you get what you pay for"" scenario. They're not bad, but they seem to be cut for someone with fairly large hands and short fingers. Probably not the average person. I'd like to know who's hands they modeled for these.Large hands with long fingers will probably split the seams between the fingers fairly quickly... especially between the thumb and first finger. They would be pretty baggy for small hands, but the finger length would probably fit. Suitable for occasional costume wear. I actually considered using them for riding my bicycle (daily commuter), and especially during colder weather because the cuffs would keep cold air from getting up the sleeves of a jacket. We'll see how long they last. At least they're cheap."
3,BUEN MATERIAL.,LA TALLA ES BUENA Y ME QUEDARON MUY BIEN. TAMBIEN LLEGARON A TIEMPO Y EL PRECIO FUE MUY BUENO SIN LLEGAR A SER LO MEJOR.
3,Looks the part,"These were really cheap, looked right with the rest of my costume, but they weren't extremely comfortable or functional and I felt as if they would get ruined very quickly if I used them too much based on the overall build quality. Bottom line, they really help to make a cheap costume instantly better, but they won't do for extended wear."
5,Great item,These Darth Vader costume gloves really rounded out the look that I was going for. I got plenty of compliments on them. The price was very reasonable as well. This item is a great addition to anyone going for the look of Darth Vader. The item arrived quickly also.
5,Loads of fun,"I purchased this set for my son's 10th birthday. He has had so much fun with it. The nice thing is that there are a couple of ""slimes"" you can make right away. The rest take some advance prep. You can do the advance prep and then go straight to the slimes with immediate results. It does take adult supervision, but he could really do most everything himself. I just stayed close to keep on eye on things. I would recommend this to any kid who loves mixing things up and playing with goo."
4,Slime,"My kids love slime! We have only made one of the kits so far and it turned out too runny, but can't wait to make more slime. It's fun for boys any way you slice or dice it and you get a little science education out of it as well. My kids are 4 and 8 years old."
3,Kind of a pain,This slime is fun to play with after the pain staking process of making it. The experiments do work but they are time consuming and you have to be very precise in mixing the chemicals. Not recommended for kids to make. You will be the one making it.
4,Birthday Present,"I bought this for my 13 year old son. He had fun making the slime. It does have a few, uncomplicated steps, but it requires following directions to do it correctly."
4,Wild!,"This was bought as a joke for an adult. He LOVES it, and actually said he had the greatest time and that it was good for stress reduction."
4,Excellent Presentation and Storage Portfolio,"This portfolio has been fabricated well. There is plenty of room to add extra archival sheet protectors. (TIP) Go ahead and purchase the extra protectors along with the portfolio case, glad I did. Only complaint is that all though it was fabricated well, they used some very strong chemicals in its fabrication. Once unpacking it I had to leave it out in the garage for almost (2) two weeks until the VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds - aka New Car Smell) dissipated. The off-gassing was serious enough for me to actually get a headache from it. Outside of that, it is a very finely made product. 5 stars - 1 star for strong chemical smell = 4 stars rating."
4,Excellent book,"What to say?, if you like Carl's Sagan work, then you wil like this book.Carl Sagan's point of view. amazing!"
5,Fascinatingly readable,"As with everything by Sagan, this book was so educational (even though it's 30 years old!) and interesting, and makes me regret not going into science! So much to learn and contemplate, and it's almost completely comprehensible to the average reader. Highly recommended!"
4,ok,"i guess this is my own fault, but, the pages were way more yellow than i expected. other than that, product was fine."
2,Boring,"Maybe if I was in a exo-biology class or some other acedemic pursuit, it would have held a little more merit. But as a casual reader, it was DRY and uninteresting. I couldn't even force myself through the first chapter, I was falling asleep. boring. get Ascent of Wonder instead!!"
4,"It's Sagan, for heaven's sake!","At some point in my life, much of what Sagan wrote became ""common knowledge"" and much less interesting to read, because I stopped learning from him.Then I realized: he had done his job. Sagan excited me, thrilled me, MADE me go out and learn more because I couldn't stand not knowing.Carl Sagan was a master at distilling science to the masses; he made physics, biology, cosmology, math...he made it all so thrilling that the masses barely knew they were learning.If you're not already a Sagan fan, try starting with his fiction (Contact--the book is a thousand times better than the movie), and then moving on to his nonfiction. You'll discover from Sagan why we are where and who we are.Read it. Learn it. Then outgrow it. You'll be honoring Sagan, and you'll be honoring your own humanity."
5,Re: the Velikovsky debunking,"The chapter entitled ""Venus and Dr. Velikovsky"" is a masterpiece of pseudo-science debunking. Sagan rightly deplores efforts by mainstream scientists to suppress Velikovsky, both because they were dishonest, and because (as noted by another reviewer) they made Velikovsky a martyr when he might otherwise just have been forgotten. Sagan's dissection of Velikovsky's thesis is painfully specific, precise, methodical, exhaustively researched, utterly polite, and totally relentless. This is the way to take on pseudo-science: with not a trace of snobbery or arrogance, but with simple, devastating logic."
5,A LIFESAVER,"I am a journalist so I received an advanced copy of this book to review. I have a two year old and a newborn so I assumed ""sibling rivalry"" was years away. But when my two-year old started acting out (blatantly disobeying, throwing tantrums over apparently nothing), I turned to this book. There is an indepth section on what happens when a new baby enters the scene that has been a godsend. It has been such a relief to know that my older daughter's behavior is not just common, it's to be expected. This book has made understanding and dealing with her tantrums and defiance much easier. I feel confident that if and when the REAL rivalry begins I will be equipped to handle it in a loving and nurturing way."
3,Just okay...,"I was hoping for guidance on how to introduce our new baby to our toddler. This book is better suited for parents introducing a new baby to a child who is 3 years old and up. Brazelton mostly tells you what to say to your older child in certain situations, as they come up. He spends a lot of time describing, in detail, certain scenarios that might occur between siblings. For example, he describes how children play together and what behaviors might lead them to fight over a toy. I became bored with the psychological descriptions and wished he'd spent more time offering practical advice/ideas."
4,weird and beautiful,"Told from the perspective of a young man trapped in a sand pit in a remote village with a woman whose life is dedicated to digging back the sand that threatens to engulf the village. The surreal situation is described in minute convincing detail, as are the thoughts and emotions of the hero, and his many desperate attempts to escape. It can be read at many levels: as a Beckett inspired allegory of the human condition, as a parallel to the Greek myth of Sisyphus, as an exploration of the conflict between modern and old Japan - whichever approach you choose, it's a strange and eerily beautiful novel to be savoured slowly."
2,See the Film Instead,"I saw the fascinating film based on this novel made by Hiroshi Teshigahara, and hoped that the novel itself would be even more illuminating. Alas, that's not the case. It's about 25% too long, comprising of a lot of non-sensical, convoluted ramblings of the man. I would not compare it with Kafka's writings by a very long shot. I have no idea how others see so much in the novel. To me it simply shows a lot of weak irrelevant musings of a highly self-centered lost soul. However, the film is an absolute masterpiece, free from all pseudo-interpretations of the novel and with a few added sequences, which make it so much more meaningful.You do not need the novel at all. Watch the film several times, instead, preferably the Criterion copy & be prepared to be immersed in an ocean of symbols all indicating nothing short of human predicament."
3,Sand. And more sand.,"Just a caveat: I found this book incredibly tiresome. I agree with certain of the reviewers here on the depth of its metaphors and its poignancy. Nevertheless, this book was task to finish. I believe the comparisons to Kafka are quite deserved, except that Kafka did it much better. Still, if you found Kafka tedious, do yourself a favor and don't read this."
3,Dunes and Dont's!,This book was good because of the existentialism. What is life? Where are we? What are we doing? KewlGurl asked herself these qestions many times while reading this. But I didn't like the stuff about the sand. It made me itchy.
