5,Exciting and funny. A must-read for X-wing fans.,"In the original four books from the X-Wing series we got a fresh story with completely new characters to whom we soon felt attached. Wraith Squadron continues that tradition by presenting us an unusual group of upstarts who have to battle their own personal problems at the same time they help in the fight against the Empire, proving their true worth. Being a silly guy myself, I especially loved the duo of Ton Phanan and Face. Don't overlook this book, you'll find yourself laughing and maybe even feeling a knot forming in your throat as you enjoy this story."
5,Very educational and historical.,"Sara Nephew has focused on the craft of the American woman and explained what our grandmothers were doing. This helped me identify old quilt designs that I had inherited. She also gave great directions on saving a quilt, identifying fabrics, and basic problems with some unfinished quilts. I will keep this book handy for future reference."
4,the book i've been searching for,"besides the excellent history and care sections, this wonderful little book has great photos of pieced and applique quilts made in the 30s and the templates and instructions for them.most of the quilting books i've found that claim to present 30s designs offer traditional 19th century blocks made with feed sack prints or simplified 30s blocks that lack the true 30s character. some of the designs in this book are challenging to sew but many quilters like a challenge.i would recommend this book to any quilter. it's a great value for the price and better than many more expensive books."
1,Quilt book,Book came very damaged with the back cover cut clear across the back and the book was bend out of shape
5,Love it or Leave it,"""I'm trash I tell ya"". This movie is pure camp, politically incorrect in every way, and immensely entertaining. As Greg Peck said to Jennifer Jones at the water hole, ""We've been spoofing ain't we?"". I think that says it all!"
3,Insulting,"I cringe every time AMC runs this film. One of the most racist. sexist movies I have ever seen. All the women characters are idiots. The sight of Jennifer Jones playing a ""half-breed""(ie. Mestiza, A Mexican) in brown grease-paint is offensive to the sensiblities of this 21st century Latina. Plays heavily on the stereo-type of women of color being sexually loose. Gives me the same nauseating feeling that African-American people probably have when they watch ""Gone with the Wind"""
3,"Oh, it's not THAT bad...","Reading some of these reviews makes one think DITS was a notch or two below Ed Wood. Yeah, the script is often trite and/or corny as well as unbelievable, and these is some miscasting or at least under-development of characters (Cotten, for example), but as a whole, the film is emminently watchable, simply for its sprawling saga-like tale. It's not a masterpiece of cinema by any means,but far from garbage. Yes, Peck and Jones go way over the top sometimes, and while Jones was not a great actress, she was far from talentless,as evidenced in some of her other films. And, truth be told, if you think about it objectively, her scenery-chewing sequences here aren't that much worse that Vivien Leigh's in Gone With The Wind. Yeah, it was a better film, but let's face it; Viv wasn't exactly below the rim the whole film either. Absolutely worth seeing."
3,Turgid Is The Word.....,"My quick opinion: 3 stars because I'm sentimental about the great stars in it. The fatal flaw, picked up on decades ago--and correctly--is that the emotions are overwrought, the characters underdeveloped, and the attempts to create genuine emotional tension, and involvement on the part of the viewer, too calculated and artificial to be ""real"". Rightfully assessed as a failed attempt to reproduce the oomph of ""Gone With The Wind"". It's basically a turgid, forced melodrama, despite the best scene-chewing efforts of the admittedly sexy Jennifer Jones and a very against-type Gregory Peck. A legendary film, but not a great one. ""Lust In The Dust"" indeed."
1,An Epic Depression Inducer,"My mother just went on and on about this movie, until I relented and bought a copy for her. It failed to play on her DVD player, so I brought it home to try on mine. In retrospect, I wish it had failed to play on mine as well, but it didn't. What a morbidly depressing saga. It is an immense waste of talented actors and film. The only reason someone would want to watch this more than once is if they were horribly depressed and they were looking for something minutely less depressing. I'm not that much into slash and gore movies, but a Quentin Tarantino movie is even less depressing than this one. Boooooooo!"
2,Worth seeing...sort of,"Jennifer Jones was absolutely gorgeous. Beyond that, this film is...well, kinda hard to watch. Gregory Peck's character, ""Lewt"" (or ""Lewd,"" IMO), is suitably repulsive...the plot is weak...Miss Jones overacts painfully, contorting all over the screen...Joseph Cotton appears tranquilized (or perhaps alcoholized, which is understandable, considering what he had to work with here), the script is at times unbearably corny...one longs for someone to put Barrymore out of his (and our) misery...in fact, it's hard to come up with much of redeemable value...I derived some masochistic enjoyment from it and spent much time with my mouth hanging open in disbelief at the campy awfulness of it all.I was grateful when it ended, though."
5,MADBALL!!!!!,These boys have so much PASSION it ain't even funny! I feel it all the way here in Cali! These guys play straight-up in yo face hardcore and they ain't taking no prisoners. I have spent many a nights in my bedroom screaming along with these fools! Props to Madball for some serious hardcore and keepin' it real! You know!!!
4,"Great album, but...","This album is all hard-hitting in your face NYHC, it doesn't get much harder. The lyrics cut you in half and the drum work is especially great, it gives the album such a hard-hitting sound. The instruments are the aural equivalent of a brass-knuckled right to the jaw. I must say however, that the recording style of the vocals leaves Freddy's vocals SLIGHTLY lacking in volume and intensity... his singing style is good and fits well with the music, but the way that it was recorded makes it sound thin, unless you REALLY crank the volume. This is more than likely rectified in later Madball releases.Overall, however, this album earns 4 1/2 stars and is still worth the money, and Madball still kills."
2,OK,"Other people love this album. I picked it up cause of the great reviews. Its ok, the lyrics are a bit weak, the only real good riff in the album last about 6 seconds and is written by agnostic front. It has grown on me slightly over the last year, but in the end it's still weak."
5,Wisdom for the wise.,"Mr. sandford does an excellent job of explaining the interrelation of deliverance and inner healing. I have witnessed an attempt to deliver a person without the necessary inner healing follow up. The results were disastrous. Many take for granted the healing power of God, omit repentance and never deal with the root of the problem. Perhaps arrogance motivates people to wield the power of the Holy Spirit without using wisdom. This book is a must for anyone interested in deliverance."
4,Valuable Information,"The book is a good blend of information on inner healing and deliverance. Although the line between the two still can be somewhat blurry even after the numerous stories and examples shared.All in all, the book is a good resource for personal as well as pastoral use.Another reviewer referred to the author's arrogance throughout and the author does direct you to every other book he has written--or his wife has written or his other son has written--and that is a bit of roadblock. It seems hard to believe there aren't other resources the author(s) could have charitably mentioned instead of their own. Maybe a bit of the lack of humility they write about exists within their own ministry.But as I said, overall, this is a good book that really has a lot of useful information."
3,Worth a read,"I found this book interesting and helpful. The first part goes over briefly the steps of writing a novel and getting published. The second part shares the experiences of other writers. If you are not interested in the second part, purchase a different how to book. Although part one was helpful, it is only a quick view of what you need to know. Of the whole book, I did find Chapter 4 inspiring. You are basically walked through the four steps of what you need to know about your book before you begin writing. This book is worth the read, just don't rely on it to take you all the way to the publisher's desk. Of course this is only one writer's opinion. I have seen here that others found this book extremely helpful."
5,Wonderful Purchase,"Wonderful strings. Wonderful price. Great resonance, and I love the feel of my bow along them. Very smooth."
5,What an Album,"This album is just brilliant its such a complete product, i love how dark and haunting the vocals go and how deep and meaningful the guitar work is, it just rocks totally, i would recomemnt this album to anyone who's into the hardcore scene who wants something a bit more doom and gloomy than Biohazard or Sick of it all"
5,profoundly disturbing...,"This is an album that would make even the most anti-metal person think twice about hardcore music... I love this CD. Certainly not something to listen to on a picnic in the park, but Keith's voice has a haunting quality that *made* Life of Agony stand out."
5,This record taught me to listen to hard-core,"I don't know how the guys did it, but this record is one of the best hard-core records ever made. However, I don't agree with all the people saying that LOA has sold out. See them live now with Whitfield Crane instead of Keith Caputo, their show has improved 10 times."
5,L.O.A.'s masterpiece,"not only is this the best album from Life Of Agony, this was the best album that was released on Roadrunner records in 1993. the music's got the NYC toughness and heaviness, but it also has Keith's piercing, soaring operatic vocals which gives the music a very nice balance and contrast. after this album, LOA kind of evolved into a more melodic, rock-oriented band rather than the metal/NY hardcore band that they started out as. the only drawback from this album are the theatrical segments between some of the songs that chronicle the days of the week in the life of a depressed, suicidal teen spiraling to his self-demise. a little over dramatic for my taste, but nevertheless, this album is still a f*ckin' beast, and in my opinion, one of the best metal albums of the 90's."
1,Give me a break!,"I like Life Of Agony, I have all of their albums. I honestly don't understand why this album gets the best reviews and Soul Searching Sun gets the worst. It should be the other way around. This album is by far their worst. It had probably 5 great songs and the rest all sound the same."
5,Ozzy has got nothing on these guys.,"I would have given the CD 4 stars but this masterpiece stands out way too far above your standard heavy metal album to give it anything less then the highest rating. Some of the other reviews that I read make references to ""perfection"" I guess I would have to agree. I cant think of another CD that I have bought that hit me this hard. There is a lot of passion in the music and it comes together really well (Kicks Ass). The 4 stars would not have been for the music but for the obnoxious references to suicide that I probably could have done without. The originality and drive in the core of the music more than makes up for it. ""Life of Agony"" has been around for a while I just wish I would have discovered them sooner.....Better late than never."
3,Excellent Explanations and Tips,"Coby it's excellent explaining. She mentions every single detail of what she is doing... the tools and make a review at the end of every module. She also mention good tips.However, the makeup looks are very day time and casual.Nothing new! if you are looking for something more professional or if you are one."
3,barely worth the money,"really good remixes here, but the cd as a whole is barely worth 14 bucks. 3 remixes of self-immolation? come on....that's just a bit too much...anyhow, if you dig industrial music, this is a great cd to buy, but if you are looking for another cd like demanufacture or soul of a new machine, look elsewhere. THE TOGA LIVES ON!"
4,Good turn for Fear Factory,This remix ep almost is to the edge of something you would take to a dance party. They definatly can use the word regrooved especially on martyr and self immolation. Although the remixes of Self Immolation are my favorite they very much sound like each other i think us consumers needed a little more of a diffrent approach to that song remix than what was offered. I give much thanks and acknowledgment to this EP cause it gave Fear factory the open set for the Metal/Industrial sound you hear from them to this day.
4,FEAR FACTORY STILL RULEZZZZZ!!!!,ok this is ok but it didnt quite seem like fear factory. but still its really extreme and the beats still grow on you. my fav on this ep has got to be scumgrief deep dub trauma mix because if you ever get the chance to see FF live (lets hope everyFF fan has) this is what they perform now and the song is just cooler like that. fear factory is the FUTURE!!!
1,Was this really necessary?,"Fear Factory are great but this remix CD isn't worth the money. I mean 3 remixes of Self Immolation? Plus there is only 6 tracks on the whole album. If you're looking for a good Fear Factory album pick up one of the 3 studio albums.(preferably Demanufacture) Or if you must have a Fear Factory remix CD, buy Remanufacture. They're all better than this."
2,Poor Book Description,"The book I had ordered came in timely fashion, but pages 46-80 were missing. The description of the book was normal ""wear and tear"" on cover but everything else in perfect condition... only to receive it 34 pages less than when it was published. Timely fashion, but false advertising."
1,it's spelled Herschel,Not Hershel. Good grief. Top signs a product isn't worth a dang without having to order it...typos on the cover.
4,True Rafferty fans will appreciate this album more,"This is Gerry Rafferty's fifth studio album from 1982 which only charted in the UK at #39. This album sounds really different compared to the first four. The songs are more synth/piano dominant compared to his earlier albums which had a guitar dominance. This album delivers a more chill, mellow pop/rock sound to Rafferty in which most of us never heard at the time compared to his usual folk rock sounding songs. This album features three singles: ""Sleepwalking"" (the more commonly known song on many compilations), ""Standing at the Gates"" and ""A Change of Heart."" I think that you have to be more of a true fan to appreciate this album, it took me a couple of times listening to it to appreciate it, but if you are more of a fan of the commercial music of Rafferty I would suggest going for the ""City to City/Night Owl"" 2 CD set from Collectables Records."
2,Clarks England????,Clarks England?? but the shoes are actually made in China... i'm dissapointed I paid to buy a pair of Shoes made in England not in china...
4,Sonny and Cher's kooky innocence captures America's heart,"While ""Good Times"", Sonny and Cher's only movie together will hardly go down as a classic film, the couple's endearing relationship and genuine love for eachother shines through in this kooky comedy. Sonny's penchant for slapstick is especially evident, while Cher plays herself to perfection. There really is no plot to this film, which ironically, is part if its charm. In fact, the entire movie is Sonny's struggle to come up with a plot for a movie he is contracted to make with Cher. His imagination takes him away more than once in a series of comic sketches from the old old west to Walter Mitty. Several scenes in the movie were actually filmed in Sonny and Cher's own house due to budget restraints. Their interaction as a couple is totally genuine, much of it actually ad libbed. Definitely a must see for Sonny and Cher fans."
5,"""killer""","This Cd is fantastic...new age mixed with a little smooth jazz...very well done with hypnotic beats and rhythms, very effective! Perfect listening when high quality is on demand. The producer needs to make a second volume...hint, hint...he was on target with this piece!"
4,Works Well,The cable works as advertized. My only concern is it doesn't attach completely without close attention. Once attached it performes flawlessly.
5,Classic social comedy still funny after 50 years,"The noted academic & novelist Pamela Hansford Johnston wrote The Unspeakable Skipton in 1959, when the world was a very different place. I first read the book about 20 years ago, and again this week. I enjoyed it greatly both times.Although it is part of a loose trilogy, it is complete in itself.The novel certainly doesn't appear anti-feminist to me. Indeed, most of the male characters are shown to be more or less incompetent rogues completely without awareness of any kind - especially self-awareness. The ladies are treated relatively generously, to my mind. And if the Australian woman poet is based on the person that I suspect, then she has got off very lightly indeed!"
2,"""not a distinguished work""","As a feminist I found this book troubling. Ms Johnson's humor is unimpressive, and her narrative will prove offensive to most women who believe that males are making women's writing somehow secondary and unimportant. It is very frustrating indeed."
2,anti-feminist and somewhat offensive,"Pamela Hansford Johnson created in ""The Unspeakable Skipton"" a novel which fails to do justice to the courage of great feminist playwrights, whose works continue to inspire the rest of us. It is unfortunate to find so popular a writer as Ms. Johnson mocking the efforts of Dottie, the feminist writer in the novel, as if Ms. Johnson had no idea of the extent and variety of difficulty feminists have had in trying to get their work staged. It seems that males are given license to treat women's writing as if it were unimportant because writers like Pamela Hansford Johnson mock women writers. It is probably not a very important loss, however, because she writes rather poorly and has little story to tell."
2,"holes, chipps and scratched",I love the movie so I was excited when I was able to purchase it on dvd. but when i receved it i noticed when I was unrapping it (from its BRAND NEW PACKAGE)the plasitc corner of the dvd case was chipped off. no big deal I said to my self all I wanted was to watch the movie. I put the movie in the dvd player and flipped the case over and noticed that a hole was punchered in the back... ok still no big deal. i start the movie and my player tells me that it cant read the disk I take it out and it is full of scratches! how can a brand new movie that has never been open have a million scratches?! i was able to go throught the scene selections and was able to start it from the thrid scene and have skips through out the movie. it will not start form the beginning.
5,My son absolutely loves this book!,"This is currently #1 on my son's reading list. He could listen to this 20 times a day. I think he likes the fact that it's realistic---there are kids out there like Claude, that really make kids like Timothy not enjoy school as they otherwise would, but then Timothy is able to find a way to overcome his sadness. The pictures are wonderfully expressive. A real gem of a book."
2,I give the original 5 stars,"I am not sure why this book was re-illustrated and re-written. The writing revisions are not too bad, but the illustrations are not at all in the same league as in the original. They are big, bright and colorful. Perhaps they make the book a more successful read-aloud. If I had come across this book without having seen Wells' original, I'd have given it a higher rating. I'd have really loved it. But when you've already had the best nothing else will do."
1,Disappointed,"Let me start by saying I love Wells and most of her work. Both of my kids have loved her Max and Ruby shows and books. I had bought Timothy Goes to School awhile ago for my daughter. We read it last week in anticipation of kindergarten. The start of the book was good with the mother loving Timothy and helping him ""fit in"" with the other students. Timothy is teased by another student at school each day named Claude. The book ends with Timothy making a new friend who is also teased by another student. The ending of the book has Timothy and his new friend laughing about and making fun of those who tease them. This book is teaching that if you are teased, the best approach is to tease back. I am trying to teach my children to treat everyone nicely, even if they are mean to us. I am getting rid of this book from our family library."
4,One of Rosemary Wells's best,"Poor Timothy! He just can't get it right. He always wears the wrong thing and is humiliated by his insufferable deskmate Claude. He wishes something bad would happen to Claude -- which, of course, it never does -- until he realizes the best revenge is having friends of your own. A sweet tale that all small children can enjoy."
5,"Japanese Gardens in a Weekend: Projects for One, Two or Three Weekends",Another terrific book to add to our collection of Japanese gardening and architecture.We love the serene styles and techniques.This book gives us the opportunity to further explore the Japanese culture.
3,Good for Ideas,"The illustrations were good and provided some great ideas. However, the book lacked step by step instructions for DIY enthusiast. I never realized my dream of that awesome Japanese Garden Backyard, instead I bought a patio set to BBQ and drink beer. Even the Patio set took me hours to setup. You have to have 1000 hours of experience to build your own decent garden."
3,garden book,I love japanese gardens but this is not so easy. Great pictures and great ideas but I'm not very handy. I wish it was made a bit easier to follow. Some supplies are not easy to find in my area. But great ideas anyway.
1,MSG MSG MSG,"The product description neglects to inform the consumer that this Lipton Recipe Secrets mix contains MSG (monosodium glutamate). After calling Lipton to inquire why they still include this questionable chemical, I was told the kosher equivalent of this product (Lipton Recipe Secrets Kosher), does not contain MSG."
5,A complete biography on the life of Dr. Seuss,"I did a presentation on Dr. Seuss for a college course. I researched for days and this book contained more helpful information then all of the books and websites put together. The best thing about ""Oh, The Places You'll Go"" is that it is written for children and is very easy to read. The book is entertaining as well as informative, the author got her information from the family of Dr. Seuss and includes many examples of the kind of person Theodore Geisel was, just look at how he quit smoking! This easy to read biography is good for children or adults that want to learn more about this wonderful author for a school assignment, or for entertainment."
2,fell apart too soon,"super cute, but really cheaply made. we bought them for christmas and they are falling apart. not worth the $"
1,Poor Quality,"Purchased these for my 6 year old niece who goes to private school, so only wore them infrequently. After only two months, the sole has separated from the boot base; very disappointing. The boots were worn in Arizona so it's not like wet or snowy weather impacted the wear. Save your money and just by Uggs, the may be expensive but will last much longer."
3,ITS AIGHT! I'LL GIVE IT 3 1/2 STARS.,"IN MY OPINION, I THINK THEY COULD HAVE DID WITHOUT SOME OF THEMEMBERS IN THE GROUP(AB & ROLX). BUT ANYWAY, THE REST OF THEM HELD THIS ALBUM DOWN. DUTCH & SPADE ARE DOPE. GILLY DA KID (G.D.K.)GOT ONE OF SMOOVEST VOICES IN THE GAME. AND M.F.'S FIRST LADY BIANCA IS NO EVE, BUT SHE IS TIGHT TOO. IF THEY CAN SOMEHOW GET SOME BETTER PRODUCTION ON THEIR NEXT ALBUM,THEY BE ONE OF HOTTEST GROUPS OUT THERE. PHILLY,PHILLY!"
5,Ramma Lamma Ding Dong!,I ordered these knives for my groomsmen at my wedding in August. They arrived quickly and were perfect gifts!
4,Rather expensive but it seems to work...,"My elderly mother suffers from Parkinson's & arthritis. For the past three years or so, she has had to curtail her daily activities. The pain in her legs have had her unable to walk and even do the simple stretching exercises that keep her mobile. She's tried a number of different products. Since starting the Australian Dream Cream, she has more than doubled her walk and has been able to resume simple household chores. To me, it has been quite remarkable."
1,Can't review this item.,"Never received this item. Was told that it was returned as ""undeliverable"". I have received credit on my credit card. I suspect that the shipper used a wrong address and I do not blame Amazon."
5,Very very high quality product.,"This pair of tweezers is superb to any I have ever owned. The accuracy of their manufacturing is so precise they come with a small plastic sheath. I am glad this sheath accompanies the tweezers being the sharpness of the machining for each tip. The length is perfect for medium sized hands. The quality is to the level I feel it unnecessary to use them to rate the durability, they are durable as all get out.The price is a little steep but a high quality instrument that has such small tolerance and one that will last such as these tweezers is well worth every single penny. Buy these and you will be the tweezer ninja you have envisioned in your dreams since you were a wee squirt. :)"
5,Stingray!,""" Stand by! Anything can happen in the next half hour!""At last I have the entire series to enjoy. The package arrived in a timely manner exactly as discribed in the dealers ad."
4,Stingray The Complete Series,"I used to watch this one also on tv in the 1960's. To me at that time I thought it was really cool. Since I saw supercar I started watching the half hour episodes of Stingray. I liked the way that Gerry Anderson put together those kind of episodes also I liked his puppetry. The episodes were so put together that it seemed like the puppets were almost human and did things that us humans do. So for me that's why I bought Gerry Anderson's Stingray. This video collection is good for anyone of any age.Signed,Phil Hitchcock"
3,One size doesn't fit all - Need a Tall size,"I bought this for my girlfriend and it stated that ""one size fits most 90-150 lbs. Now my girlfriend is in that weight range. (~140 actually), but she is 5'9"" tall and it got runs in it from her stretching it as she put it on. Plus would be too baggy since she's not fat. The crotch ended around her upper thigh, so I wound up having to further rip it to make room for business. She still looked sexy as hell in it, I'm just saying they need a tall size."
2,cheap!,"when i got it, i was pleased thst it was soft. I opened it up and as soon as i put it on. i pulled just a little and it immidiately started to run!so all in all , you get what you pay for. i guess"
4,Helpful for those who need to be in good voice,I do a lot of training and had trouble with a dry tickly throat. These really help and don't contain any artificial sweeteners. I'd rather brush my teeth a little more often than suffer the digestive upset from sorbitol or other sugar alcohols.
3,Not as pictured,"These lozenges work great. The problem is I did not receive the same product that is pictured amazon website but rather just 1 big bottle with 150 lozenges. I don't want to carry it around... I was specifically looking for smaller boxes one for each backpack, home, work, etc."
4,Helpful,I ordered these because I read that they help coat the throat. I have GERD and I thought I would try them out- to protect my throat from acid reflux. They help a little bit.
2,Somewhat trite; poor photography; wasted content,"I hate pictures in books taken with cheap cameras. Some of the photos reveal stuff you would never have thought of? Why a picture of a pushup or a neckroll. I am a USPTA tennis pro (from Bollettieri's in Florida) and some of the exercises in this book are not tennis specific. Here's the big problem: Exercises with weights can often cause erratic stroking. Too many bicep curls, for example, often cause an upward swing forward. Remember: You only have 17 degrees left/right before you hit wide shots. Dumbell fly's can cause you to hit too far forward, which for right handers will pull the ball wide on the left when it crosses the net. I was annoyed at: NO index. Maybe weight training might help an upper level player with endurance, but it's nowhere near as beneficial as cardio exercise. Pass on weights; get on the court!"
2,"Decent Info, Horribly designed book","This book has no index, making it impossible to find any specific exercises without combing through the entire book."
2,Chips easily!,"I dropped these two inches from my hands to the counter and it chipped! You even have to be careful stacking them so they won't chip. I spent a few more dollars and bought corell, and haven't broken a plate in over a year!"
4,Sango Wear,"I have the complete Sango Set and love it. Very durable, dishwasher safe, microwave safe, these little square plates are a great addition."
2,Welsh Bordeux Outdoor light,"The deisgn is attractive however, the paint is not lasting outdoors. I oredred a couple of these 5 years back. The color faded within 3 years."
3,OK but didn't Use Much,Item seemed ok but didn't keep up with child's interest and was soon given away to thrift store.
3,No interior key pocket!,"These are listed in the ""running"" section, so I thought an interior key pocket would be a given. What a hassle to have to return these, especially given the seller's return policy, which I would encourage you to thoroughly check out before purchasing (by the time I return these I expect to have almost paid the price of the shorts - just for shipping - and they don't even weigh a whole pound). Hopefully this review helps someone else to whom a key pocket is important. I give them 2 stars for being cute, though."
1,It is made out of Stryofoam,"Do not buy this product unless what you are putting on it very light! This does not hold more than a few cupcakes, laid out evenly. I was incredibly dissapointed with this item. Think: would you want a cake, 19 inches in the air, to be sitting on a stryofoam base? It does not work. Go for a different stand, set it up at home and keep the receipt if it doesn't work!"
2,not sturdy,"I got this stand for a wedding cake I made for my cousin. Once we got to the venue and wanted to set it up, one of the stakes wouldnt hold the cake.It kept shaking and rocking and didnt support any weight. We ended up putting it on an upside down champagne bucket. It was pretty upsetting."
5,Great Bracelet,"Ordered this bracelet from Amazon, got it very quickly and have had it for a few weeks. I wear it all the time ane love it. It is exactly what I wanted and just what they said it was. I am very happy with the product!"
4,A Wonderful Look into Family Life,"I first heard the author on NPR and was able to get the audio version of her book. I have listened to it many times and have shared it with many of my friends. I particularly enjoy hearing the generational stories that Ms. Coleman tells so well. It is great insight into another culture that is different, yet so much the same."
4,Entertaining and original,"Lorraine has done an excellent job of telling the story. Maybe because I've had the opportunity to hear her as a story teller and I can just imagine her reading and the expressions she would use. I am a READER in the true sense of the word. Its one of those books that makes you wnat to call someone and read excerpts so they can enjoy it with you. There is something for every ordinary person. It one of those unheard of books that could end up on the Oprah list.This book needs more publicity. It should be on every African American reading list, although I'm sure other cultures would enjoy it as much. Especially, those who enjoy old southern tales and humor.GREAT JOB Lorraine and Family (because I'm sure they helped. LuLu)"
1,An embarrassment!!Shame on Lorraine,"Now we're back to ""Step' n Fetch?"" This book sets us all back at least 50 years. Rather than being called ""Just Plain Folks"" it should be called ""Just Plain Dumb!"
5,"Very fun, interesting game","We had a lot of fun playing Xactika. It sounded like it might be hard to pick up, but it was a breeze. It reminds me of spades, but with a more interesting strategic element to it. I highly recommend it."
3,Hard game,Received promptly. It is a lot harder to understand than I thought and diligent to play. The grandkids have no problem.
4,Great card game,"Fascinating and fun game. The dynamics and strategies change a lot based on the number of people playing (up to 8 players). Takes playing a time or two to get the feel of the game, but well worth the effort. Good instructions, and a set of ""helper"" cards included so players can keep track of the probabilities (though they don't call them that). My only complaint is that the cards are a heavy paste board that doesn't wear very well if you play a lot (and we have been). Highly recommended game for those who like Wist, Hearts and the like."
2,This seems familiar,"Amazon[.com] recommended this game for me, based on the fact that I love the game Set. Unfortunately Xactika bears a strong resemblance to ""10 to 1,"" a game played with a normal deck of cards. If you already know how to play ""10 to 1,"" Xactika may seem derivative. After trying Xactika once or twice, we threw it in the drawer and just played ""10 to 1"" instead."
4,"Mixed opinion, but overall fun!","My fiancee and I are big card gamers. We love Quiddler and Five Crowns, so thought we'd try this one. Overall it's fun and challenging. However, occasionally it can be a little overwhelming and if one person playing ""gets"" how to bid a little better the result can be a very uneven playing field. We're getting there though!"
2,Blech,"I'm one of the few, the proud...a person whose into a lot of gothic, depressing music who didn't really care for this album at all. Rather than sounding dark and moody, as I hoped, it sounded like seem deep-voiced guy who breathes too much inbetween each verse aping what he assumed depressing and dark music should sound like.I'm not saying that these guys have no talent or that their songs aren't compelling (Black No. 1 and Christian Woman *are* arranged pretty well), but, to me, this is like daytime soap operas.There's all the things that should evoke feeling in me (death in the family, somber moods, and seperation) but its presented in a way that makes it all so melodramatic to be sapped dry of emotional content. For people out there searching for real emotional content in their music, I suggest they give bands like Joy Division or The Chills a good listen. The first four or five tracks of this album are good, the rest needs tossed."
3,This is DARK,"I bought this album because I totally fell for Type O Negative's version of Summer Breeze featured in the very beginning of the movie I Know What You Did Last Summer.And I must admit, that one is the least dark song of Bloody Kisses. The album, like all other stuff from the band, is about love and death, religion and darkness. Both the lyrics (which are brilliant and probably daring for a US band) and the music underline these themes in a very well-worked out way.But to a ""normal"" fan of symphonic rock, it gets a bit too much. Half the album is enough. It IS an interesting new experience though."
2,"Ok, but vastly overated and to be honest... corny",Black No. 1 is an ok tune but this CD is vastly overated and superficial. Beware before you purchase this one. If you are a fan of cheesy metal then go for it but this one is.. well... dumb IMO.The cover to Summer Breeze should be taken out and shot. Goofy.
2,Pretentious,"Type O Negative is probably THE most over rated ""goth/metal"" band out there. I heard that this band, and particularly, this album was amazing, but when I got it I was severely underwhelmed. The lyrics are nothing short of stupid (Black No. 1 is about HAIR DYE), the melodies are bland, and the vocals sound like that guy from Crash Test Dummies. Avoid this."
3,Gripping when not groping,"3 1/2Though it may squelch and squeak over soothe a little more then you may remember upon original purchase, even somewhat tinned production, lame humor, and darkened sound-scape overkill, the group's patented brand of sluggishly beautiful goth-metal holds up, a humble variety and many different approaches taken throughout not lost upon the positive cross-demographics the band found success in. They keep the balance keenly marked between straight-bashed rockers and more heavy-breathing chillers, but accelerate way further with the latter."
5,One of the Best Albums Ever Made!,"I don't say this without it meaning anything. I was plesantly surprised by this album the tracks CHRISTIAN WOMAN, BLOODY KISSES are two of my favorites, however the entire album is a dark delight. After Sisters of Mercy has been played to death on your stereo, pop this bad boy into the cd player and prepare to be amazed. Great album!"
5,Goth Rock With a Twist,"Type O Negative should get at least five stars on every one of their albums. I own all except World Coming Down, but I have heard all the songs off of it, and every song that I have heard was off all of their albums were the best songs that I have ever heard. So if you want to hear good music listen to Type O Negative."
3,Incomplete,"The Top Shelf Edition of Bloody Kisses is supposed to have two discs - one with all the tracks from the original release, and one with 8 bonus songs. This only has three songs glued onto the end of the album. It'd be much more satisfying if it included the remaining five."
4,Best music to get a tatto to,This music will forever be burned into my soul (and body) as it was playing while my tattoo was being put on my body. I went out and immediately bought the CD which is very dark and very deep. You have to be in the right frame of mind to listen to this music. Certainly not for light and easy listening...but the very bad girl in me loves it.
4,"ICY, DOUR, FTLSTK",En gus En mus lik it ; ve go zame hih skool here. Zuizide h'rmny en daprzing vocas tho. Em suma sans not to badd. Visch ad mre bete. Not to badd.
4,"I love their remake of ""Summer Breeze""!","I really like this CD. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I don't really care for the ""punk-sounding"" songs on it. However, even though I don't really like the lyrics to ""Christian Woman,"" I love the music. I also like ""Black No. 1"""
5,The Best CD that Type O - has ever put out!,"How can I define it SIK,A TREAT,or plain and simple perfect?perfect.I loved it!1.Christian Woman (10/10) Great Lyrics with a pleasing beat.I enjoyed all 11 minutes of it!2.Bloody Kisses (10/10) Scary!Talks About Romance and deathdon't listen to it at night.3.Too Late:Frozen (10/10) Amazing lyrics makes you feel likeyour changing moods all of the time.4.Blood & Fire (9/10)Okay.Kinda reminds me of a Nickleback song.56and7They are the same.A good mood song and thats great once in a while.(10/10)8.Suspended in Dusk (10/10) Scary Don't listen to at all!9.Black #1 (1000/10) YEAH!"
4,Great but Not thier Best,"This is a great album full of satire, wit, and campy evil. Camp aside, it is still a very dark album and would not be appreciated by all rock fans. This album is definatly not hard rock. It would be good for anyone who happened to like Sisters of Mercy, since they have a similar sound, indian influences of the Sisters aside. This is a good cd, but if you want thier best, try October Rust."
2,Easily Thier Worst,"Well honestly I can't see the attraction that so many have to this album. I feel that the only good this album did in any sense was set Type O Negative in good direction to later create ""October Rust"" and ""World Coming Down"" which both got 5 stars from me.This was Type O's unfortunate breakthrough because it denoted the bands ability to stand on firm ground with a more diverse base of fans. This ""notorious"" album pales horribly to associate with the bands inevitable growth. This album is decadent and lacks thier more profound and cunning facetiousness, thier brutal satire with gorgeous melody.Be good to yourself wont ya? Buy ""October Rust"", ""World Coming Down"" and ""Life is Killing Me"" they are just far superior to this album."
3,Dracula's soundtrack,"Am I the only one that has a different version to this album? Blood and Fire is like track #12 on my album and it sounds radically different. Oh well.Either way this is probably one of the best Type O albums to date and for good reason. If you're a fan of this genre, then Bloody Kisses is for you. All songs are continuous and moody as all hell and pretty catchy. I never thought slow and low could sound so good, but it does. Such a shame they haven't been able to get more recognition for their work."
5,Music To Live By.....,"Type O Negaative's music is doomy, melodic and retro. They combine the dynamics and progressive aspects of 60's and 70's classic rock, the morbid atmospherics of 80's goth-rock and add a 90's contemporary metal vibe to it. The music on Bloody Kisses is varied and touches upon every innate human emotion, including anger, despondance, love and hate. The songs are mostly long and epic like, textured and layered. Beautiful and haunting melodies combined with subtle aggression create an ethereal and outerworldy feeling. The songs are also very eclectic, ranging from the haunting orchestras of ""Bloody Kisses"", the creeping epic beauty of ""Christian Woman"", the good ol' Rock'n'Roll vibe of ""Bloody Kisses"", to the 60's pop-influenced ""Sets Me On Fire"", one dimensional heavy metal this is not. Perhaps one of the more original albums of the decade. A must buy."
5,Worth it !,battle for the bundu was one of the titles I was looking for my collection and it came securely wrapped and in great shape Thank-you.
3,Newer era Death,"The 1st Album was Scream ,the 2ed Leprocy, 3ed Spiritual, 4th Human ,5th Individual ,6th Symbolic , 7th Sound of ,then 8 Live.1 through 3 are the rawer Brutal stuff the Fate compilation was taken from. After this Human was made and the band started it's new era where Chucks voice is different a little more screaming gutteral and less low gutteral .Old Death is great to me because the riffs show up in other bands songs every now and then .They wrote the book"
2,Hummmm...boring?,"The musicians are good here, and the music itself is pretty interesting. The vocals though, play a large hand in ruining anything this album had. Yes, yes, it's not just the fact that it's your typical death yips, but also that they sound really, really forced and repetitive -I don't know who can sit through more than the first few tracks. It's as if he lost his voice, but they went ahead anyway ...and, man, must have been burned out by then end of the whole ordeal. Not only this, but the lack of variation in the vocals seems to have somehow lured the rest of the music into the same dulling-down pattern..?As an instrumental album, this would have scored better...with a dynamic vocalist, this could have (dreamingly) been something pretty good. Because I've liked some of the ideas of Chuck Schuldiner, I'll give this more than one star."
1,Awful,"Ok to keep it simple, this is truly, utterly and without competition the worst album i heard for some time. I know that all you head bangers will hate me for this but this really is a perfect example of how a band can be enslaved in a clische and not being able nor wanting to do anything about it. Without to much phylosophy this music is desperetly boring, dull, bereft of any creativity and imagination. It sounds like 9 same songs recorded over and over. Honestly don't go looking for good metal on this cd, any use I see for this cd is to put it underneath my shelf so it would be in balance."
5,best metal album of all time,"This shows the more progressive side of Death in their later years. This is the album where Chuck Schuldiner decided to go into a different vocal direction with a higher pitched growl rather than the lower end gutteral vocals. Every song is impressive in it's musicianship and each song is unpredictible with speed and riff changes, yet still very easy to remember. This is one of my all time favorite metal albums with one of my all time favorite drummers. If you want an awesome progressive death metal album, check this masterpiece out."
5,CLASSIC,SYMBOLIC WAS A CD WITH GREAT SONGS FROM START TO FINISH ON THIS CD CHUCK SINGS AND SONGS GREAT KNOW OF THAT DEEP VOICE THAT YOU CANT UNDERSTAND. BESY CUTS ARE SYMBOLIC AND ZERO TOLERENCE EVERT TRACK GRINDS WITH GREAT GUITARS
5,"Simply put, - Death Metal at its finest","What can be said about this album that has not been said?Chuck ~ This page is not big enough for the shower of praise and admiration you are deserving of. R.I.P., we miss you.Gene ~ Drum GODKelly ~ Will forever be known as part of the lineup that spit out Death's finestBobby ~ DittoNot to undermine Kelly and Bobby, they are both killer. Damn! This is a sick album! Perennial Quest & 1000 Eyes are the best tracks. A must own. If you're new to Death or Metal, start with this one."
5,Death Metal at it's Best,"First of all Chuck you are dearly missed. I was never into death metal,because I like vocals. I must says that this album definelty has some awesome vocals,riffs and beats. If you are unsure of death metal,pick this one up for it will make you a beleiver."
5,"Don't read it for the facts, it's out of date, read it for the interesting way of writing about science.","I bought this at a used book store in the early 1960's as a teenager. It whetted my appetite for space, but made me realize that I probably didn't want to be an astronomer because of how much physics would be involved in that career. Many of the astronomical facts are out of date of course, but the writing is clear and interesting. Read it for the perspective of 1961 on space, astronomy and physics."
2,Deserves a better title,"I'm afraid this book is not what it looks. Though it is well written and somewhat interesting, if you need a how-to book on disaster recovery, this is not the right place. This 104 page booklet deals only with DOS and Norton's undelete very basic features, hardly useable under real life incidents. You'll find some tales about how to solve a suicide, or to search for a criminal, how to get around some trivial password protection and some other funny stuff, but don't expect to find your lost data after a virus attack after reading this book."
2,Disk Detective is dated/For beginners only,"First I'll start by saying, this book was good to read if you need a starting point and do not know a thing about data recovery. However, the material is at a beginner's level, quite dated and the $18 price tag is not worth it. Now if you come across this book at a book consignment shop, yard sale, or a book discount sale, then definately get it. I would not spend over $5 on this book. Also I didn't like reading a warning on every page to make sure that I didn't delete any important information or practice with a disk that might have info I would want to keep. Well DUH! I have a little more common sense than that! The warnings make up, no kidding, about 10 pages of a 104 page book.In summary, save your money for a book that you can use with today's operating systems. This book did not even mention Win.'98. Most of its contents were regarding the old DOS only o/s and a little bit @ Win 95."
1,Highly disappointing,"Don't expect a colorful, scenic view of the northeast. These old TV shows range from mediocre to juvenile. The ""Cape Cod"" scenes with music (no narration) is probably the best."
2,Over New England DVD set,4 Disc set-one of the dvd discs skipped and then just froze after about 5 minutes of playtime. I have sent the set back for reimbursement and we'll see how that goes...very dissappointed.
3,3 1/2 stars. A very strong release.,"This would be my last Gerry Rafferty album I got before ""North And South"" in 1988. ""Snakes And Ladders"" #61 is the follow up to ""Night Owl"". When I heard the single ""Royal Mile (Sweet Darlin')"", #54, I thought this might be another top album by Gerry (I was wrong). Also loved ""Wastin' Away"", ""Don't Close the Door"", ""Garden Of England"" and the beautiful ""Bring It All Home"" with Raphael Ravenscroft back on sax. Somebody out there please release ""Night Owl"" and ""Snakes And Ladders"" on CD please. Gerry was a true rock performer, not like these fakes today."
1,Wayyyy too salty! Blah!,"Wish I didn't purchase so much before trying it first. May be good for a sore throat in small amounts, I suppose, but I would rather have a progresso soup before this again."
2,Not much flavor,Save your money and buy Ramen noodles instead. These have lots of noodles and broth but hardly any flavor.
3,Too Bad It Didn't Fit,"The quality build of this product is not an issue, nor its functionality...it just didn't fit my Cooler Master ACTS 840. If you need a HDD cage that's unobtrusive in its appearance, than this is the product for you. But I would be a little leery of SilverStone's claim that the converter fits ANY 5.23-inch bay...it wouldn't fit mine no matter what I did [RMAed the first one]...I could have gotten flukes [but this happens when items are assembled by hand]."
3,OVERLOOKED AND RIVETING,"Vanessa Redgrave is spinster school teacher Jean Travers in David Hare's engrossing, overlooked, WETHERBY (Home Vision). This 1985 drama from the director of ""The Hours"" concerns the impact on Travers' life when a young man -- an apparent stranger -- breaks into her home, and shoots himself in her presence. Judi Dench and Ian Holm are Travers' good friends who -- much like Biblical Job's comforters -- try and help her cope and understand as she finds herself drawn deeper and deeper in a flood of memories and nightmares of unfulfilled love, longing and deceptions. Redgrave and her daughter Joely Richardson are utterly riveting in this superb and increasingly tense psychological drama that keeps its tantalizing secrets almost until the final fade out.No extras on sharp looking transfer, but box includes a printed intro by Hare and an unusually insightful essay (""Have You Been True To Me?"") by Brian Mcfarlane."
1,chilton truck book,I am not impressed with the book and if I had known it was published by the same company that published the Haynes book I wouldn't have purchased it. I have the Haynes book and it has a better knowledge of the vehicles that it represents. This was not a good buy. I am not satisfied with the book at all.
2,Disappointing,"My friend was raving about this CD, so I thought I'd pick it up used. And wow, I was very disappointed.I don't remember Fatlip sounding like this at all back in the day. Basically if you were a fan of the old classic Pharcyde albums, you probably won't dig this at all.Fatlip doesn't sound corny, cool, goofy, or fun like he did back in his heyday with Pharcyde. There's a rougher, harder edge to him on this album.There were a couple of songs that were good, but definitely not in the Pharcyde-style of music. It sounds like a completely different artist. He's gotten old, bitter, and tougher over the last decade, which is sad. Not even a Chali 2na cameo could save this one.Is hip-hop not fun anymore, Fatlip?"
5,Is this an official release?,"Does anyone know if this is an official Maiden release or is it a bootleg? I once purchased a 3CD collection of B Sides and rarities and it turned out to be bootleg, though the sound quality was excellent."
2,Best Price Media wouldn't refund scratched CD!!,"This is a marvellous double CD filled with goodies, but unfortunately CD2 is scratched and skips on every CD player I tried. When I asked to return it for a refund Best Price Media said in their email reply that 'physical damage such as scratches are not considered a defect by the manufacturers and it can not be returned for that reason.'I was extremely disappointed with this response and would counsel against buying from this seller."
3,Almost an icon of death metal,"Even when I recognize this album as one of the most important and known in death metal, I should say that it is not that good. I know I'm contrasting a lot with other reviews, but in my most sincere opinion this album is not an artwork to consider Brujeria one of the best death metal bands in the world.They are great musicians, not a doubt! But the recording is really cheap; it is full of audio problems and gaps and a lot of errors in the music (e.g. drums half time down or up, as same as the guitars, etc.)."
3,Portrait of Jennie,"I remember watching this when I was a little girl. As an adult I still enjoy the story as it is so unusual. Jennifer Jones is excellent in this story; somehow portraying a young girl as she ages to a young woman.The quality of this dvd (not movie) is poor. I don't know if the original film is so degraded that this is the best copy they can make or if I just received a poor copy. It was still worth watching.If you like odd, slightly eerie, storylines you will appreciate this movie. If you like movies that wrap up all aspects of the storyline this movie isn't for you."
5,Simply the best.,"If you're a true romantic at heart, there has been no better film made than ""Portrait of Jennie"". It is lyrical, with excellent performances and an ending that all of us want to believe in. The book is a gem and the movie was definitely worthy of it. Black and white photography was really essential to create the atmosphere looked for in this marvelous film."
4,Wonderful Surprise -,I bought this for my mother who has loved this movie since she was a young lady.The only thing I would have like was the option to have purchased it in Black and White as she had seen it originally.Either way she was delighted!
3,Enjoyed....,"First, I must say that the quality of this dvd is not the best quality. I'm not going to knock it simply because I was still able to view it... (No formatting errors) as a previous movie had, and stopped right in the middle of a great part. So with that being said, I enjoyed this weird, fantastical, sci-fi kind of deranged love story. Yet, I'm confused and am in no hurry to view it again, as of yet. But, I'm sure that I will just so that I can wrap my mind around it... It's a great love story don't get me wrong but, the mystical part of it just threw me... Some parts were just too deep for me (yeah).."
3,"Lovely movie, poor DVD transfer","I've loved this movie for over 30 years, it's one of my top romantic favorites, and I have both the VHS and the DVD. I must say I was very disappointed in this DVD print. The print I have on the VHS tape is vastly superior to the DVD. My advice is to keep or purchase the VHS tape instead. This DVD print has lines, little artifacts running through scenes, and poor color. Either that, or wait till it is run on Turner Classic Movies to see it in its perfect glory....their print is PERFECT."
5,A Portrait of Love!,"""Portrait of Jennie"" is a fascinating exercise of a most inimitable romance between the mysterious Junoesque like Jennie and struggling artist Eben Adams. Hollywood A-Lister's Joseph Cotten and the beautiful Jennifer Jones provide captivating performances in a tale of an artist and his poetic inspiration.In a unique cinematic exhibition, the movie, filmed mostly in B&W; changes to a green tint during a stormy scene, changing to sepia for an adjacent scene and ending up in full Technicolor as the camera zooms in to the completed ""Portrait of Jennie"".Dimitri Tiomkin's celestial musical score is another delightful aspect of this movie. All thru the film you will hear Claude Debussy's Arabesque #1 and other Debussy works.A most delightful 86 minutes of entertainment."
5,time can make a mistake,"If you have ever felt so unloved , that you've had to hide what is killing you inside?This is the story of a talanted artist(Joseph Cotten), who has talnt , but no inspiration, he was lost and forlor.nHe was starving , for real!!! He was walking through central park , when he metes Jenny (Jennifer Jones), his inspiration. Unbeknownst to him everything he truly needed in his life..... There is one little detail. His beloved is a ghost..........no one has told a story like this since ,well never!!! If you dont buy another Video in life, please buy this one!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,fairy tale!!!,"one of the most romantic and original story ever told!!!! great, the actors are very in the mood!! it was a pleasure to see it!!! for everyone!!!!"
3,"Worth seeing, but...","I seem to be in the minority here...""Portrait of Jennie"" didn't inspire me, particularly. I thought that Ethel Barrymore was wonderful in her smallish role...otherwise, I just didn't care for the film. It seemed overdone, and the music grated on my nerves after a while - it never let up for a moment. Joseph Cotten and Jennifer Jones have done far better work in other films. Perhaps I just don't care for this genre of film...I'll watch it again and give it a fair chance."
4,Moody and distinctive,"I read the book when I was about 13 and fell in love with it - it was everything my fevered, romantic 13-year-old imagination hungered for. Having seen the movie for the first time quite a few years later, I have to say it doesn't seem as romantic as the book. There is not a lot of chemistry between Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotten - she's too quirky, he's too much of a tortured artist. However, I love the mood of this film - very noir. The limited use of color is very - interesting, like they put a filter on the camera and washed the entire shot in the same color. In addition you have the fabulous Ethel Barrymore in a critical role. Next step is to reread the book and then maybe watch the movie again. They sure don't make 'em like this any more, and I mean that as a compliment."
4,Fascinating/Flawed Masterpiece,"Any movie made by David Selznick during the 40s is a must-see and this is certainly no exception. The great GWTW producer reportedly spent more on ""Portrait of Jennie' than he did for Gone With the Wind. He demanded countless takes, re-shoots, at one time starting to refilm the movie in technicolor, then opting for that final, surreal shot of the actual portrait in stunning color. This is a glorious ""mood' movie--filmed in lush silvers, shadows, charcoal with a power ambience of the supernatural. Selznick interfered so much in the script writing and revisions that none of the cast knew what was going on story-wise. The uncut version ran as long as GWTW. What's crazy is that ""Portrait"" was supposed to be a ""modest"" little film. But like everything Selzick touched after GWTW, it mushroomed out of proportions. Yet, anything made by this genius is a million times more watchable than most of the junk being churned out today==i.e., American Pie, Austin Powers, yuccck!"
4,Portrait of Jennie,"Very fine and moving film. Good actors, story line excellent, and filming very nice. Movie still entertaining after all these years."
3,NOTE: Low Dose!,"This product was offered at a good price, shipping & etc were good, and no complaints. However, purchasers should note that the amounts of various ingredients are the TOTAL for a FOUR-TABLET DOSE. That's a lot of tablets to be taking at once! It is easier to take a low dose, for trial purposes, but still, I prefer a single-tab dosage. Multiply four tabs a day and you're taking a 120 tabs a month, just of this preparation."
2,very slow,This book was very slow - after reading 40% of the book - I was bored waiting for the story to get to the point.
2,kinda disappointed,"I thought the description for this book was better than the actual book. It started out good but after the crash it was too slow & took to long to get the story wrapped up. And for it to be a Women of Faith series book there really wasn't much ""faith"" or a place when Peyton turned to God. It was a good story idea but just too slow & too many details I really didn't care about."
4,The Note,A good book though not great. A little slow at the beginning. I did enjoy the characters as I got to know them and started connecting. Would recommend it and I will get the next one.
4,Pleasantly unique,"I read this book for a book club pick. I was surprised by how fast I was sucked in. I'm not used to being given the book to read, I am usually the one who chooses,don't really like to read reccomendations. So this book was really interesting. It had me guessing and while there are many religious references it's not over the top religious. I kind of imagined there could be a part two to this book. Angela Hunt has a gift for words and sentences that all flow together and make you want to read more."
1,The note,"I could not get into this book at all. I tried and tried to just give it a few more pages, but finally I just put it down. I have never not finished a book before but I just could not finish this one."
3,Easy Reading,"Easy reading, just a lot like Message in a Bottle, only with a different scenario. Always a good life lesson for us."
3,Too much drama,"This was the first time I had read a book by Angela Hunt. I enjoy religious fiction, and thought The Note sounded like a really interesting book. The concept of the Heart Healer and trying to find the rightful owner of the note written by a loving father appealed to me. However, the more I read into the book, the more 'drama' there seemed to be regarding the life of the main character and her past. I felt like saying ""What next with this woman and her past?""The author needed to move on and focus on the heart felt note and the people it was intended for. There was definitely too much drama going on with the main character that took too much away from what could have been a great story."
2,"Oh, please...","This book had a great plot! I had a hard time putting it down at first. But then I lost my interest as things started to detract from the story. Much of it seemed predictable, and then at the end there were too many coincidences. I really didn't care for it and also was disturbed by a completely unnecessary scene between a man and a woman. Not worth checking out at the library, much less purchasing."
5,My favorite Angela Hunt book so far!,"Angela Hunt has woven a unique and clever story that kept me turning pages and surprised me at several turns. The story stands on its own as a captivating contemporary tale of a disenchanted columnist who finds more than she bargained for when she is given a mysterious note that washed up in the debris from a tragic plane crash. But when you delve into the allegory woven throughout, the novel becomes an amazing gem! You won't be disappointed and you won't soon forget this story."
5,If you read one book in the aftermath of Sept 11--this is it,What would you do if you had a few seconds to live? What sort of message and legacy would you leave your loved ones? Angela Hunt explores this issue and many more in THE NOTE. A wonderful story of hope and new beginnings!
2,Disappointing!,"Although, the book's meaning was good, it rambled on & did not keep my interest! I scanned through a lot of this book."
5,Very Happy Customer,I was really pleased that my package came in on time and even more pleased that the recipient enjoyed it.
4,blue prints for surgery ( blue prints sereies),"blue prints surgery is a very good review book for surgery .it is just 113 pages which makes it very easy to study and covers the important topics tested in the usmle. has got very good diagrams and tables.not for indepth study, but good source of reveiw for the boards.i recommend this book for anyone preparing for the boards."
3,Not that good.,"I used many of the blueprints books during my clincal rotations in medical school. This one was by far the worst one. The information is more of a cursory overview of several topics. There is just not enough scope or detail in this book for it to be useful. I used this book in conjunction with ""Surgical Recall"" which is an excellent book. I also referred to the ""Essential of General Surgery"" book on some specific topics such as fluid and electrolyte management that are not well covered in either book.Perhaps future editions of this book will be better."
1,Not a good text for surgery!,"If you are looking for something to review and help while on the wards or for Step2, this is not a good text. It is way too general. Blueprints for some other topics are great, but not this one. I was very disappointed."
1,Just not enough...,"You can consider a book in two ways: (1) USMLE/shelf exam prep or (2) clinical rotation/patient exposure prep. This book fails in both respects. It is astonishingly brief, one of the smaller blueprints books in the series. It skims the surface of most surgical concepts and lacks much detail. It lacks the detail and topic coverage to be an effective textbook for exam study. As for rounds and actual surgeries, this may cover some of the topics that you will be pimped on, but you'll likely be running to up-to-date for more information. I would suggest First Aid for the Surgery Clerkship which more than prepared me for both the clinical aspects and the shelf exam or Essentials of General Surgery."
4,Beautiful watch...for big wrists,"It`s a beautiful and well made watch. Don`t buy it if you have a small wrist because it`s a big ben! I wish it was a little bit smaller...hello Invicta, what about a smaller version?!"
5,buen reloj,gracias buen vendedor lo recomiendo el producto es muy bueno y funciona perfectamente gracias por todo buena atencionespero comprarles mas de verdad gracias
3,"Great quality, but.........","The watch is excellent looking but the crown digs into my left wrist(I know, it says lefty, but as a matter of course, I wear all my watches on my left wrist.) This is my ninth Invicta and this is the only one that I have any complaint about.The watch is so uncomfortable that I only wear it when I know I am going to wear a long sleeve shirt......allowing me to tuck the shirt under the crown so that it does not bite into my wrist. I wish this wasnt the case, cause I love the look of this watch."
2,Meh.,"Why the hell are any left-handed people wearing their watches on their left arms?I've always worn mine on my right arm. Watches are cumbersome on the wrist of the main hand. They're worn on the left arm by convention, because most of the population is right-handed.Why would I want to wear a watch on my main arm? So I can drag it across the page I'm writing? So I can be unable to check the time while doing anything?So, nice idea but an even better one is to wake up and not be a fashion slave. Move your 'normal' watch to your off arm.Added bonus: a little bit more 'flash' when you shake hands."
3,Good cost x benefit.,"Nice looking and it does cause visual impact, but leather band could be of better quality. However, it's a nice and inexpensive watch for daily use."
4,"So far, So good","I love how it looks, really sturdy and quality looking watch. So far, I'm very happy with the purchase (2 weeks now)"
4,I like it.,"Sometimes you love something cause it amazes you but this watch is just nice and functions very great. Glows in the dark too. If you want a okay looking watch and can't afford a watch that grabs attention than this one is it. This watch isn't amazing but it is NOT ugly or unfashionable. It makes me feel retro punk a little.The leather feels very nice but I read it wears easy, I'll update if it does.Function: It functions way better than I had expected, easy to read, light weight, comfy, not too large yet not too small, juuuuuust right sized. I'm 5'7"" ish and it looks completely normal on me. I wanted a big watch to get attention but this one just looks decent.Ps it came in a day with free one day shipping, totally worth it cause I now wear it to work and school and not look like I'm reaching in my pockets to steal at work."
1,WRONG MUSIC,This DVD has the wrong music! It completely ruined my enjoyment. I do not recommend buying this DVD just because it is cheap.
2,Didn't really work for me,"I know a lot of people rave about this film but it didn't really work for me. I know most of you are thinking, ""Oh he hates it because it's a silent movie and he doesn't like that."" But no, the silent part didn't bother me-- it was the story that sort of meandered about and the cuts were really quick. And sometimes, the film would just switch to something else going on and that made me feel lost at times. So those are the main reasons why it didn't really work for me."
4,Much better sound & Two recent live tracks!(limited only!),"I'm listening to this "" the best of Bob Dylan volune 2"" over and over again! This CD includes two unreleased live tracks ""Highlands"" & Blowing in the wind"" (I love this live version! )from recent shows! (Limited edition only!)I love new song called ""Things have Changed"" and Oh Mercy outtake ""Dignity""."
5,Durability meets Affordability,"i had purchased these kicks three years ago for work purpose. three years later i still wear them everyday. my job is fairly labor intensive, so they have really taken a beating. while they are still in decent shape and by far my most confortable shoe, i am ordering another pair or two from amazon. cant wait to get my new pair to start breaking them in!"
4,Comfortable old-school sneakers,"Very comfortable shoe with soft leather uppers. Awesome old-school styling that looks good with jeans or khakis or whatever. The only issue I had is that they seem to run about 1/2 to one full size too small, and they're cut narrower than the typical running/hiking shoes I'm used to. After awhile, these start to feel sorta tight on my feet, and my feet are not wide either. IMO, just order at least 1/2 to one full size bigger than your foot size and they should be ok."
2,Not the same as a few years ago.,"I love Adidas Superstars, and buy a pair every few years. This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures. These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year. The leather does not even seem real, plasticy, lightweight, the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish. Overall disappointed in these shoes. Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this."
1,Shoemania,"Ok, I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother. I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color. I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes. Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones, The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2. WTF? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time. Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift. The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA."
4,True Classic,This is the original perhaps with better arches than I remember as a Run DMC fan from way back!
5,Much-Needed Encouragement for Women in Ministry,"Especially women in ministry will find Dr. Claudia Brantley's book inspiring and encouraging.Having spent a lifetime seeking to do what she believed God had called her to do, this faithful servant tells of her battle against denominational prejudice. Her struggle is probably a familar one to those who may benefit most from reading the book; those who have persevered in spite of tremendous obstacles. Full of scriptural references to the validity of the position of women in church leadership, Dr. Brantley covers thoroughly this controversial subject with conviction and clarity."
3,Jaws of Menx,Ms. Maxwell writes a very interesting story of how though we may speak the same language it does not always mean we will understand each other. The planet Menx must soon decide for or against membership in the Galactic Concord. Thus begins Rhane's personal quest back to a planet he is haunted by. He must form a truce with Shiya and try to understand the mysteries of the forbidden mountains where only the gods survive. For only then can he hope to learn from the complex differences between cultures.
1,Osteen Board Game,"Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, and for Joel Osteen's bank account. Reportedly, 3 million sold. Screw the poor, give your money to the nearest Mercedes-driving preacher a.s.a.p.I got this as a gag gift, which is sad because that means more money in his pocket."
5,Nicro,"I had an old Nicro Solar vent. The deck ""fit in ring"" was bent and this item solved the problem. Perfect fit to my old Solar vent."
3,It is Ok but Child lost interest,It seems to be educational but my child was easily distracted and only interested in learning from things he like doing. LeapPad seemed too boring for him at the time. It collected dust and was givened away.
2,The So-So- Edge,"The movie has some sound problems at the beginning, which disappear somewhere after that... but, it does have sound problems."
3,Who directed? Hopkins or Tamahori!!,"Every so often Anthony Hopkins does a brilliant movie.This is not one of those times.An interesting story but not as gripping as had been promised.Also I saw little evidence of director Tamahori's workmanship,rumour has it he gave in to most of his star studded actors' suggestions.Alec Baldwin had nothing good to say about the experience.The only thing to commend it is the Alaskan scenery.A good movie but not good enough for your standards mr Tamahori.Better luck next time."
3,A little cheesy,"I'd never heard of this. Was it any kind of a hit in theaters? I thought the bear scenes were a bit cheesy, especially when the bear lands on a spear wielded by 70-something Anthony Hopkins. Baldwin is his usual smarmy self. The whole thing is a little unrealistic, in that these guys would have frozen or starved to death long before they finally trap a squirrel, which they then don't bother to eat as they huff their way, barely clothed, often soaking wet, through Alaskan wilderness for mile after mile, hardly ever slowing down. Also, I laughed out loud when they appear in perfectly tailored bear skins after slaying the bear. How did they sew them together? The skins, freshly removed from a dead bear, would have been soaking wet with blood and gore for days or weeks, in reality. The David Mamet dialogue is pretty good in parts. I never learned the exact relationship between the two rivals, Hopkins and Baldwin. In all, a somewhat entertaining watch."
4,"Does the book ""Lost in the Wilds"" exist?","I am trying to find out if the book given to Anthony Hopkins' character really exists. I think it was called ""Lost in the Wilds"" by D. Croyle."
4,Not Enhanced!!!,"The DVD picture is one of the best I've seen, especially since first seeing this film on a pan and scan video rental. Sound is great. Goldsmiths mood setting score comes in beautifuly, and the sound effects are stirring. BUT. DVD's have been around too long now for any big studio to release a DVD that's not enhanced for widescreen TV's. It is unforgivable.It doesn't take much. If New Line Cinema can release most of it's movies with a choice of widescreen/pan and scan/or enhanced widescreen, they all should be able to."
4,Great story of man vs nature,"I really enjoy this film because of the rawness of the film. A large portion of the film only contains scenes with Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins, and of course a very large bear. Lots of Scenes from a the woods in the winter time. After a plane crash the main characters are forced to find a way to survive in the wilderness as they make their way back to civilization. In walks a man killing bear who stalks them and this movie really becomes a great man vs nature film and story. I recommend it for any balwin or hopkins fans, as well as anyone who likes simple films with few characters and real human emotion, trials, and growth."
4,"Excellent movie, quality Blu-Ray transfer and sound, no extras","This was my first Blu-Ray purchase, because I was so tired of watching the old non-anamorphic DVD. The improvement in A/V quality is dramatic here, and a movie like ""The Edge"" deserves support for its crisp scenery and stunning landscapes. While it's a shame that no extras could be created for this Blu-Ray, I'm content just to finally view a quality presentation of it. Having seen the movie originally in theaters, it reproduced the experience quite well.Oh, and obviously the movie itself is top-notch. Good, escapist entertainment and strong performances.And, of course, a giant, man-killing bear."
4,Bear with me...,"This is a thrilling movie about the power of reason in overcoming all odds. It takes three men with three different philosophies and drops them straight into a man against nature situation. The timid and the irrational men quickly get into trouble while the creative, thinking man ends up getting... well, I won't spoil it for you but I promise this one is a keeper!:o)"
5,Suspensful action-adventure keeping you on the edge!,"Anthony Hopkins did an outstanding performance in surviving in the wild. Alex Baldwin lends a great sense of humor during times of great tension. Filled with many sad moments. This movie left me on the ""edge""."
2,The Edge DVD,"The Edge is a fine film and deserves at least four stars; however, my two stars reflect the fact that the DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, especially since it's presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The Blu-ray, on the other hand, is excellent and, of course, is enhanced."
2,Did not meet expectations....,"Since this movie has been reviewed numerous times and most everybody has already viewed it, my two star rating is for its failure on Blu-ray.The issues are simple:1. There are no extra features related to the movie. All you get is the movie.2. The colors are washed out and gray and the movie is darker than the DVD. The instant download from Amazon which I streamed through my Blu-Ray player while waiting for the disc to show up had better colors, but not picture.I've come to expect better quality and more features with Blu-ray although that is not always the case as The Edge proves.3 stars would make it average. The lack of extra features and the sullen picture put it below average, hence 2 stars.The movie has aged well and is still entertaining. It is just too bad there was not a feature on Bart the Bear, or on the Making of The Edge."
4,Why It Works,"""The Edge"" works because Baldwin is only convincing playing what he really is - clean-cut scum. It may be his best performance based on that. Hopkins turns in his usual impressive work and the cinematography, story, and outcome all deliver the goods. Highly watchable cat and mouse action/suspense. Too bad Macpherson doesn't get mauled by a bear though... I would've given it five stars to have seen that."
5,The Edge,Great movie that everyone needs to see. Also this company sent the movie fast without any problems thur Amazon.
5,KILL THE BEAR,"If you like Action --- Wilderness Adventure...Great actors, its A must have for our collection."
5,You'll be on the edge!,"Did the grizzly get an oscar? He deserved one! This movie has some fantastic actors, such as Hopkins and Baldwin, but the bear stole the show. After their small plane crashes when an unexpected flock of geese comes their way, three men become the hunted when a grizzly bear being tracked by locals for being a 'man killer' picks up the crash survivor's trail. But the grizzly isn't the only danger. Hopkins has a pretty, model wife that seems to have become an obsession of her photographer (Alec Baldwin). Was the photographer plotting to kill the rich husband all along? Great scenery, fantastic action and plot twists that keep you on the edge.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Simply Amazing,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time. It is the greatest representation of what would happen if someone was to be stuck int he predicament that they were in. It is not only a seriouse story, there is much truth to it, unlike other hollywood movies. I love The Edge, it is simply amazing"
2,THIS IS NOT ANAMORPHIC OR ENHANCED FOR WS TV,"How unfortunate that this movie was released on DVD by one of only several studios that refused initially to accept the anamorphic format.What this means, is that if you own a 16x9 television, you will not only have the black bars on the top and bottom, but on the sides as well. If you use the ZOOM feature of your 16x9 tv, it fills the screen, but it pixilates and degrades the video terribly. So you'll end up watching it in full letterbox hell.Don't buy this, until they do the right thing and re-release it in anamorphic widescreen. After all, they DID release it in anamorphic widescreen in EUROPE. [...]Good viewing, everyone."
1,Where's the special edition?,"Awesome movie, no doubt about it. But I already have the VHS version, and am not going to spend ... on a no-frills DVD of this movie. Where are the extras? Commentaries? A featurette on the bear and his training for this film? When and if this film deservedly gets a specialized DVD treatment, then I will upgrade and be able to enjoy this highly recommended film on DVD."
1,The Edge,"Unfortunately, and to my bitter disappointment, The Edge you sent me, would not play in Australia. The other two movies, The Usual Suspects, and Legends Of The Fall, were both OK.Regards.....Tony"
5,The sudden twist of fate!,"A billionaire accompanies his supermodel wife to a location placed in Alaska. But the fate has another plans and the plane will crash in the middle of that huge wasteland, the wilderness with all its merciless intensity around this intense and existential drama.Sumptuous landscapes and brilliant performances conform one of the most honest works in the career of this young filmmaker."
2,"Love and murder and bears, oh, my","THE EDGE quickly intrigued me. What was going on with Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin and Elle Macpherson? Unfortunately, that promising start went nowhere. Next thing I knew, THE EDGE leaves Elle behind as Anthony and Alec get chased through the forest by a kodiak bear, who, I might add, proves smarter than the average bear. (They should have brought a picnic basket.) Anyway, I kept waiting for THE EDGE to get back to the human drama with which it began so well, but it never did. It seemed to me that THE EDGE was supposed to be a different film until someone discarded the love/murder triangle story for wacky hybrid of JAWS and THE DEFIANT ONES."
5,Incredible,"Baldwin and Hopkins are masterful actors in this film. This film's suspense is top notch, and Hopkins' performance proves to me that he is in Olivier's class as one of the top five actors of all time, hands down."
4,a pleasant suprise,"When this first came out i wasn't interested in it at all. It looked just like all those other dumb survivor movies. My Dad saw it on a buisness trip and convinced me to see it. I can honestly say that i realy realy enjoyed this movie. What made the movie very very good was Anthony Hopkins' character's interesting personality. His character loved to read and new almost everything it seemed like. If i tell to mutch about the movie it will ruin it but i suggest seeing this movie, it is my second favorite movie Anthony Hopkins' was in to Silence of the Lambs and you know how great that movie is."
5,Excellent thriller!,This is one great movie. It will keep you on The Edge of your seat. The tension between the 2 main characters is the driving force of the movie. The acting is supurb. The Bear scenes are excellent also. A good movie to watch over and over again!
5,Love this movie!,"Anthony Hopkins....WOW...Great outdoor adventure! Just in case anyone's interested the book he used in the movie (survival in the wilds) does not exist. It was just a movie prop..I know, I wanted a copy of it too...lol."
5,Love it!!!!,"I love this movie!! With a name like The Edge I thought it would be cheesy, the only reason I even watched it was because of Alec Baldwin. Much to my surprise it was brilliantly written, and the dialogue is the kind of special writing where you have to pay attention, and suddenly it's two hours later and the movies over and you absolutely love it. As far as the seller goes, it shipped fast and was here on the estimated date, no complaints here. 10/10"
5,Two thumbs up,Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin are the perfect combination for this film of survival and redemption. An instant classic.
5,"Great script, great actors, great scenery","This is truly a thrilling movie, and they couldn't have chosen a more beautiful setting. I've seen wilderness survival movies before, but none have conveyed to me how savage the wild can be as strikingly as this movie. The dialogue is also extremely clever and, thanks to the great acting, believably impromptu.If anything, watch it for the ending. That still gets me every time I watch it. Truly amazing and inspiring.Oddly enough, I'm not usually a fan of Anthony Hopkins nor Alec Baldwin, but this movie certainly has me singing their praises."
1,Gorgeous scenery and not much else!,"Brother, this one was bad alright! Could be an entertaining turkey for Turkey Day, however. My favorite 'so bad it's hilarious' scene was the one right after the crash where you see that all their clothes have dried (overnight? in the freezing cold?) and they look quite dapper and well put together."
1,Hahahahahaha,"Well this film really [was bad]. It was just like every other lousy hollywood films I've seen. First of all. I got this dejà vu feeling when I started watching, and I thought: I've seen this before (I hope you all now what I mean with this), but I kept on watching the whole films. Later I realized how sentimental,silly and simple it was. Not even the bears looked real. I could (only) find one god thing with it though: Alec Baldwin...He's absolutely gorgeous!! He played the kind role he's perfectly capable for and did it pretty well actually...So if you like him. See it! Otherwise, don't!"
5,Movie-The Edge,This is another movie I enjoy watching over and over and over. It is never boring. Any movie with Anthony Hopkins is worth watching! I am sure everyone agrees. Him and Alec Baldwin were superb in this movie. I am glad to own it now on DVD!! Awesome movie!! Thanks.
5,"WONDERFUL, INTENSE , AND UNFORGETABLE !","This is one of my favorite adventure-suspense films of all time. After a horrifying plane crash, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Hopkins, and ??? get stranded in the Alaskin wilderness. Then, just when things couldn't possibly get any worse, they must fight a blood thirsty grizzly bear to stay alive! Will they succeed? This movie is wonderful and exciting to say the least. The acting is great, the scenery is breathtaking, and the storyline & plot are convincing & very life-like. Enjoyable."
3,The Edge,This was a sit up and take notice kind of story and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout much of the picture. Very good suspense.
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,"I'm not very good at writing reviews, but I can say that this movie stinks. If you want a good laugh, watch it. Anthony Hopkins plays a billionaire (apparently one with Asperger's syndrome) who knows ""everything"" (but in a good way), especially the fact that most people who die after becoming stranded die ""of shame."" I think Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin should have died of shame for being in this clunker."
5,The Edge,"Suspense movie starring Anthony Hopkins as billionaire Charles Morse married to a beautiful super model played by Elle McPherson as they go to Alaska for a swimsuit shoot. Alec Baldwin plays the photographer Robert Green, who plans to kill Hopkins in the wild to ensure that he not only gets his wife but collects the guy's huge fortune. They fly out to the middle of nowhere to find a man that Green thinks would make a perfect piece for the photoshoot but instead, their boatplane runs into a flock of geese that damage the plane and forces it to crash. Charles begins to piece two and two together and figures out that Green is planning to kill him someway. As this plays out, they unknowingly are being stalked by a giant kodiak bear played by the late Bart the bear, lol. The action picks up as they try to survive and kill the bear and find their way back to civilization. Great movie and the cast is superb especially with Hopkins as the VERY intelligent billionaire. You'll love it!"
4,Great Film - Poor DVD,"It's an entertaining survival story, but the US Region 1 NTSC DVD sold here is washed out and grainy, rendering otherwise outstanding scenery looking like a poor quality video tape. I purchased the PAL Region 2 edition from Amazon UK and the difference is striking. If you have a multi-region dvd player and a PAL compatible display - order that one. It's the perfect type of film to justify a future Blu-Ray release."
5,Snugglers (pig),"I bought this item for my 3 1/2 yr old daughter and she loves it! You put their bed pillow in it and it becomes a plush, soft ""piggy"" pillow- case. It has a big soft head and feet which hugs her body when she sleeps. She sleeps with it in her bed, and also likes to watch tv laying on it in the living room. Comfy! Highly recommended."
3,Pillow pet is better....,I bought this for my three yr old because she wanted a pillow pet for Christmas. I'd sugggest gettting the pillow pet. Just a prefrence I guess...Otherwise it's okay.
4,The pilliow is super cute,My daughter has had this for about two years now. It holds up just fine! I do think $40 is a little much for the pillow case.
2,Increasingly disappointed,"I bought this program three years and loved it then. I would stick with it, cause I liked the way it worked, back when it did. However every Windows update breaks something else. It's become flaky in too many ways to list; it changes instrument voices from one playback to the next, has stopped copying and pasting, can't copy it's own saved songs correctly. Reinstalling, even with fresh downloads, doesn't fix anything. As the computer is fine with all other apps I don't think it's the problem. I can't say Notation won't work fine for you, but you can do at least as well with other low-priced software."
4,Easy Information,This book has 'reader friendly' information. This book is a useful tool for people watching thier glycemic levels.
3,GI food index,"Info is easy to understand but seems limited in the foods listed. Also was hoping for an alphabetical index of foods as a means of looking things up, but it is listed as all the other books are, in groups of low, medium, and high GI ratings."
1,unacceptable,"I didn't get my order. I have written, and it should have been here, but still has not arrived. I am not happy."
1,Ouch! If you dont mind corny....,"Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful. I don't think this is the type of thing anyone could like but judging from the other reviews I'm wrong. The humor is blank and bland. The acting is terrible. DONT SEE IT EVER. Don't do it you will never want to watch a movie again."
3,"Dukes of Hazzard Third Season - Still In Hot Pursuit. Kgyu,kgyu.....","The Third season of DOH finally establishes the proven formula that carries the series until it's final season.Although the ""Let's Frame The Dukes"" plots are standard issue in every episode,it's the variations of it (like Three's Company misunderstanding cliche) and how Bo and Luke solve the dilemma that keeps it from getting boring.Sonny Shroyer (Deputy Enos Strate) departed the show to star in his own self titled series(which only lasted one season), to be replaced by recurring cast member Rick Hurst as Cletus Hogg.Rosco also aquires Flash,a lethargic Basset Hound with no love for Boss Hogg.Classic episodes include Carnival of Thrills,And in This Corner, Luke Duke, The Late J.D. Hogg, Baa, Baa, White Sheep(featuring Hogg's good twin brother Abraham Lincoln Hogg),Mrs. Rosco P. Coltrane, Duke vs. Duke, The Return of Hughie Hogg, and The Canterbury Crock."
3,Saves some legwork but...,"On the surface it is a greate product and if all you have donated during the year is clothes then you will be very happy with it. It is quite lacking in other areas such as electronics, kitchen and household items, fitness equipment, etc. As far as technical support, don't expect much if you don't have a web connection. But since the alternative is tromping around to find price estimates, I'll give it 3 stars."
1,Caution! Only good for 1 year...,"Nowhere in the advertising, the packaging, or even the ubiquitous EULA does it state that this product is only good for a single tax year's use. Not until it is installed and the user is asked if it will be used for tax-year 2002 or 2003 does the user get any inkling that this is a one-year license, just like Turbo Tax. So be aware, if you think you're going to be able to use this year after year to track your donations, it won't let you! Not without purchasing the annual updates, anyway. Getting this software not so much a ""purchase"" as it is a ""subscription"" that needs to be renewed every year."
4,"needs improvement, but still worthwhile","A must have for garage sale addicts. My usual pile of donations was valued at over eighteen hundred dollars, according to the software. Valuations tend to be over thrift store prices. The software is fairly easy to use, but watch out-its easy to delete all your donations. The receipt printout was useful."
1,Do your research before buying these,"I bought two of these due to an infestation of mice in my house. One is plugged in the outlet directly above the kitchen counter, and there is still evidence of mice being on the counter at night. Save your money. Invest in sealing your house, and buy snap traps to kill the mice currently in your house. See [...]"
1,muzaknut,"THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK!! Not only did it NOT run the bugs away, they were LIVING INSIDE IT! When the bug proplem still persisted, I unplugged it to possibly move it to another outlet. That's when I found the bugs living inside it!!!! It certainly made a nice ""home"" for my ""guests"". If a refund is available, I am mailing that dude back!!!"
2,doesn't work with deaf rodents,"While I was staying in a barn in Russia, I had to use the Ultrasonic Rodent Repellent for mice and rats. These things don't work with deaf rodents. Since the rodents lived near a munitions factory and bombing range, most, if not all, had lost the use of their hearing. They would infest the barn I slept in, often biting or nibbling me during the night.Rodents are especially problematic during the hot, sticky summer months, as they breed like rats. They carry fleas (often with plague), urinate and defecate on food crops and are a nuisance.The traditional Russian method is to sleep with a hammer but with so many rodents, it's impossible (and tiring) to kill them all."
5,Rob Halford is Judas Priest and he is back with a vengeance!,"After being a Priest fan for 20 some odd years myself. I am glad to say that the Priest is Back once again like the days of old. Halford ""Resurrection"" showcases the talents that have been sorely missed during the years of JP substitute vocalists. After leaving Screaming, Rob Halford is back with a Vengeance showing us that he still has the sounds and range of yesteryear. This is the best album I have heard in Y2K. The bonus tracks are awesome songs that should have been on the domestic release. Every metal afficianado should own this one."
4,Excalibur,"It may not be as tough as King Aurther's sword Excalibur, but certainly useful and appears quite durable, stable, elegant, with various time options."
3,excalibur chess clock,This chess clock (Excalibur) is adequate. Not as comfortable as the pricier chrono clocks but meets requirements and expectations. Has a very large number of preset modes. Straightforward to operate. Looks and feels a little bit flimsier than some others but I am not sure whether it is only looks. The buttons to press feel a bit odd but there are no real problems. I understand this clock was and is now again the USCF standard. Buying it from Amazon was as usual a fine idea as the item arrived safely and being a prime member I did not have to pay shipping. I recommend the clock.
4,Decent,"It's good and has survived fast and furious bughouse chess games. It doesn't have the must usable interface for settings, but it works. I don't think anything cheaper will be as reliable; you can always pay more for a better interface on other clocks. You definitely need to read the manual to get it working. I would give it a fifth star if the interface was better thought out.Overall I'd recommend it."
4,good clock,The clock works well and the instructions are easy to understand. It does what is says it does. it looks durable and it has a lot of preprogrammed times so it's easy to use.
4,Excalibur Game Time II Chess Clock,"Product has a bit of learning curve, not very intuitive. But when you understand those details, product is great, especially if you are a chess addict like me!!4 AA Batteries have an incredible life time, if you want to protect your product make sure you remove those batteries if your product is not going to be used for a long time to avoid those nasty leakages"
3,decent clock,"This is an ok or decent clock. It is fairly sturdy even if it doesn't appear to be so. You can set it for various time controls including time delay. It is a bit complicated to set, you need to either read the manual or ask someone who has one which I have noticed has been a problem for many players, as you see them just before the games start madly asking everyone if they know how to ""set this clock?"" Rather amusing. I always have to have my son help me with mine as despite my high rating I'm not a techno-wiz. [...]"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought one of these because I thought it looked cool and it was cheap, but as soon as I took it out of the box I knew I had made a mistake. The buttons were flimsy and the quality of the clock's plastic was terrible. I put in some batteries and one of the buttons didn't even work. That same day I packed it up and returned it. A month later I purchased a Chronos for $40 more and have been happy ever since."
1,Cheaply built with a terrible display,I am usually good at doing the research and not ending up with a bad product like this one but I guess I was not diligent enough. The display is unreadable and the device is so cheaply built it looks like it may not last more than 1 good game. Do not buy this product rather roll up the 50 odd dollars and light it up.
2,Brute Man,"Rondo Hatton plays the Creeper in the cheap, dull and exploitative THE BRUTE MAN, and gawking at him is about the only reason to get this one. After exposure to poison gas in World War One Hatton contracted a disease that severely elongated and deformed his facial bones and Hollywood came a-calling in the 1930s. Hatton appeared in about twenty-five movies, almost always playing a mute bad guy, before dying of a heart attack shortly after THE BRUTE MAN was released.If you want to see Hatton in an enjoyable flick get THE PEARL OF DEATH, a 1944 Sherlock Holmes mystery with Rathbone and Bruce."
4,Delightful fluff,"Alright, so it's not THE MERRY WIDOW. WHITE HORSE INN belongs to a group of late Viennese operettas that attempted to combat the popularity of American jazz and musical comedy by intermingling these styles with traditional operetta music in their works. What results is uneven in quality but always charming and at times a little bizarre. Think of it as Irving Berlin meets Franz Lehar. The orchestrations used on this cd are very different from two recordings of highlights of WHITE HORSE INN I have (Benatzky did not orchestrate his own music) and a bit more traditional than is usually heard. I should also add that the singers are first-rate (as with all of the EMI Viennese operetta recordings) and the dialogue is thankfully kept to a minimum. Overall this is a fun if not particularly operatic light opera."
1,Don't buy it!,"The first log that I tried to lift was about 10"" in diameter and 8 feet long. I placed the unit about 20"" from one end. The socket that the jack stand plugs into snapped on the first lift. I don't know if the metal was crystallized from welding or what but is was extremely weak. I ended up welding in a reinforcing gusset to make the thing work but it is still substandard."
2,Could have been alot better.,"I just don't why ""Noboday but you"" got such great reviews from readers. The two main characters didn't any for me, infact I began to think that they didn't even belong together. This book just was not able to hold my attention, I have to confess that I kept counting the pages until I was done."
1,PIAA Super Plasma GT-X 9005,"Do not buy this product to gain a whiter appearing light. After installing the light on one side of my vehicle, a panel of my neighbor, wife, and myself, could not see any difference between the PIAA bulb and the stock bulb. I wasted my money, don't waste yours."
1,"If the category existed, I would rate this book Minus 3.","Poorly written, stomach-churning potboiler, masquerading as science fiction. The writers of the B7 series would have been appalled, as were many of the faithful fans at this effort. The science is laughably inaccurate, the plot is pure 30's pulp and the characters are disgusting and bear little resemblence to how they appeared in the actual BLAKES 7 TV series. I've read far better fan fiction in this series universe."
3,Avon's Legacy,I enjoyed this book very much. I was a new fan of Blakes 7When I bid on a copy of Avon A Terrible Aspect at a Fan convention charity event. Author and Actor Paul Darrow verygraciously autographed my copy...I wanted to see the character Avon through the eyes of theactor who portrayed him. I was not disappointed. It was an interesting read.My favorite TV show Blakes 7 and my all timefavorite character Anti-hero Kerr Avon were explained in a waywhich brought me full circle as a fan and arm chair adventurer.
1,Over America Deluxe Box Set,"The producer tried to put stuff together, only the 4th disc (Washington DC) worth watching."
4,Arrived unexpectedly,"Arrived without notice! I check Amazon and it was still being prepared when it arrived.It also came with some inconsequential dings which don't coincide with minor damage to packaging. Had been retaped both outer and inner cartons.Sold as new; but arrived with wheels pre-assembled in reverse, showed no wear!Works well for my purposes, thus far."
3,It's simply ok,"I purchased this product to tote photography equipment and as a ladder for on location sessions. I was initially disappointed by the bulkiness of the unit and further disappointed when I discovered that when there is something loaded onto the base of the unit, it won't stand by itself. There is a roughly 2 inch gap between the hand truck base and he floor...so when you put something on it, it falls forward which (for me) means I have to completely unload everything or hold it up every time I move on location. It is well build and sturdy for around the house."
4,Tells it Like it Is,"Titanic Warning is a great read about the state of the western Church in our day. After receiving this book and diving in I was unable to put it down. This book is well written and very matter of fact. If you are looking for a good dose of deep theology then this probably won't float your boat.The historical studies of the Titanic disaster are worth the price of admission, but the wonderful and damning parallels drawn between the ship and the church make this book come alive. Get this book for yourself and then get one for every church leader you know. This is an easy, enjoyable and convicting read."
5,Parent-Teacher Association as it really is,"Tingley gives an excellent overview of how educational objectives have evolved from instilling self-esteem to achieving high scores on standardized tests and what a problem that has created in dealing with today's parents. She acknowledges the frustrations teachers feel and frequently complain about, then skillfully uses humor along with sound advice to get beyond the griping and deal with the problems unreasonable parents can present. The book would be very helpful as a basis for role playing sessions for teachers-in-training in order to master the skills of being in control, getting parents on their side and most importantly, handling themselves as professionals. Even veteran teachers could benefit from reflecting on the amusing, yet accurate parent stereotypes Tingley has captured through her years of experience."
4,Good Book for Professional Educators,"This book will fill a useful role on my bookshelf at school. It's a quick resource for dealing with parents, who can be more challenging than the students. I recommend it to you because if you can control the parents, it's much easier to control the students."
2,Some helpful tips in the fluff,"This book is too glib for my needs. There were some helpful tips in the book, but they were usually engulfed by all the fluff. Most of the information in here can be obtained through work experience and common sense. You get what you pay for for."
5,"parents, school","Very good reference for those who would like to become a teacher. It gives you the real world of parents and teachers. If you want to survive and love teaching, this manual helps."
1,Before I read this - one question:,"I heard that the author died prematurely. Would somebody post = what did the man die from? Before I look further into this, I wanna know..."
1,Satisfaction only for a Moment,"Living overseas, and an avid collector of late 60s rarities, I was delighted to be able to mail-order this collection. However, I was extremely disappointed to hear crackles as soon as I loaded the first CD - obviously mastered directly from an original vinyl album. Apart from the sound quality, which ranges from OK to distorted, I was also bewildered to find that the order of tracks on both CDs bore no relation to the track listings on the original albums, and that there were no liner notes for what is potentially an interesting re-issue. Very disappointing indeed."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"If your looking for info on the main line of die-cast cars, this is not the book for you. Buy volume 1."
2,Light Weight Construction,"These seats are an economy seat; however, the construction of the seat is very light weight and flimsy. The listing does not indicate that the seats have a 200 pound capacity rating which is probably why they are warranted for so long. After installing them on the pedestals it was very apparent that the seat bases were not stiff or supportive and had a pressure point in the middle that you could feel through the cushion. Also the flexing of the seat back was pretty severe."
2,Wise Economy Low Back Seat (Grey/Blue),"This is a great seat,very comfortable but not for salt water use.Staples and fasteners were used in construction that is not stainless steel or copper if you need it for a river boat then it might stand up longer."
4,Really nice seats,I bought these for a jon boat. They appear to be well made (though the bottom is molded plastic). I have set one up on a swivel mount and tried it briefly and find it to be comfortable. I will be putting these to THE test this coming Monday and will further update when I return.UPDATE: We find these seats to be mostly comfortable. They made our recent fishing trip MUCH more comfortable despite some minor issues with the mounts I chose to use. I will stay with my 4 star rating on them. They seem to be a good value for the price.
1,Look elsewhere,"At best, this is an oversimplified rehash of Betty Edwards', ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain."" As a much better alternative to both of these books, look into Brenda Hoddinott's, ""Drawing for Dummies."" Brenda's method is very methodical and step-by-step, not to mention fun and a little silly,(just like Brenda!) whereas this particular book calls for a ""If you only look at what your drawing, it will be easy!"" attitude. Nothing truly worth doing is easy. Check out Ms. Hoddinott's Drawspace.com website as well. You won't be sorry you did."
4,Works fine,"I would like to see at least one compartment in this. I use it for a small gym bag and hate my keys, phone and I pod to be all mixed up. Other than that it is fine"
5,Accessory bag set,"After looking at two other bag sets that seemed very similar, including the CLC bag combo, I chose this set. They are made of the same material, each with a heavy-duty zipper, and an enhanced bottom to keep it flat. I only wanted them to hold a pair of 4-gauge 18 foot jumper cables in one of the bags. The other unused bag is sitting until I find a use for it.There were no dimensions in the description, so I compared the small and large dimension in the description of the CLC bag combo to these bags. At 12 x 4.5 x 5.5 inches and 14 x 5.5 x 6 inches respectively, it appears these are the same dimensions."
5,Great Tool Bag for Accessories!,"Great storage idea for all those miscellaneous tools that seem to get lost in your larger tool box / tool bag.These storage bags are well sized (website should give LxWxH to give you an idea what size you're getting). Quality is pretty good....heavy duty fabric, solid zipper. Excellent bag for the buck."
4,Perfect for carrying a few tools.,"I need to carry a few tools in my motorcycle saddlebag when I go longer trips (tire repair, inflator, a few metric wrenches, etc). These bags are perfect. I only need one for my kit. My saddle bags don't lock, so I drop this in just before I go, take it inside when I stop for the night, or when I get home - perfect. Feels sturdy enough that it should last for years."
5,Great Bags!!!,"Great bags, mainly needed the larger one to hold tow strap and other recovery gear for the storage area of my Jeep. sturdy construction and well made, just what I needed!"
5,good quality,"These bags are a great deal for their size. They come in handy for tools, first aid kits, and are great to keep things organized in the car trunk."
5,Great for Toiletries,I use these bags for toiletries when traveling. One for bathroom items and the other for everything else. They work great and don't take up alot of room. The top opens wide so it is easy to see what's inside.
4,MCGuire Nicholas Accessory Bags -- 20214vp,"Two small, good quality zippered canvas bags for $9.34. Happy with product, but the $5.04 shipping charge was a bit much. Products were received in a timely fashion."
5,Preparing for the Best Years (and Sex) of Our Lives,"I'm a man over 70, and I can tell you that this book is on point in so many ways.For too long there weren't books like this one or Seasoned Romance, All Night Long, Amazing Sex After 60, Sexy After 60, or Sex in the Golden Years that focused on the needs and desires of a senior male, as well as women. Things are different for all of us, for sure, but lovemaking can still be pretty damn good for us too, and it is reassuring to know what other men have gone through.These are such great books if you desire intimacy and passion, regardless of your age or gender. So are the other books I mentioned.So get back in the proverbial saddle and have all the great seasoned sex you desire!"
2,Righteousness,"I noticed that a ""former"" minister stated that this church teaches righteousness by works...i beg to differ, i am a researcher and found no such thing. I encourage all readers to go to the source.adventist.org. this christian organization teaches the biblical righteousness by faith."
1,I'm stunned... don't read this book!,"I have read this book and find that the author must have had a bad encounter with another ""human being,"" not the SDA church. I find his comments calling the SDA church a cult laughable. Aren't we normally afraid of what we don't understand? SDA is not a cult. They are true Christians in every sense of the word. May God continue to bless each of you."
1,The author is very ignorant...,"This book is very ignorant of the Seventh-day Adventist Doctrines and belief systems. After reading the first chapter, I quickly discovered that this man has very little knowledge (if any) of the subject. What a complete waste of money! If you do read this book, make sure that you check out Amazon's refund policy first!"
1,This book lacks Biblical proof of its claims..,This book makes alot of claims but does not us scripture to back it up.
1,Negligible Intellectual Stimulation,"As a young Seventh Day Adventist college student I am curious to see what (in this case negative) things are said about my religion. I had hoped to find within this book some intellectually stimulating and well framed arguments that would give me food for thought and study (which I have found elsewhere and therefore know they exist). In stead I found a book written by a disgruntled former Seventh Day Adventist who uses this as his outlet for mud slinging - not only does it not have any well framed arguments but many of the points made in the book are quite slanted not to mention some completely inaccurate ""information""."
1,Total Waste of Time!,"This book is the worst book I've ever read! Isn't it necessary to have a knowledge of a religion before we characterize it as a cult? I've personally read some of Ellen White's works, and they are all true, from the Dark Ages to today! I'm sorry this book has even been published. If you ever longed for the truth, PLEASE don't read this book! May God bless you not to make the same mistake I did :)"
5,Excellent Book Which Illuminates,"This is an excellent review of the beliefs of Seventh Day Adventism. From believing that Ellen Harmon White was a prophet, that Christ was Michael the Archangel(what a pernicious heresy!), to soul-sleep, the Sabbath, and the whole nine yards of Adventism, revealing it for what it is: a nineteenth century cult,based on works, with many beliefs coinciding with the Russellite movement=falsely prophecying dates for the end of the world, etc... A small, excellent work."
4,SDA beliefs reviewed,"This book is a ""no nonsense"" review of the beginnings and beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church."
1,Total baloney,"Slattery's bellyaching is pure phony baloney. I was raised in the Methodist Church and became a Seventh-day Adventist well over 40 years ago. The vast majority of his arguments are completely false, as many others have stated. I don't know what the author's problems are, but he definitely needs some therapeutic help!"
1,So sad...,"It's amazing that people allow themselves to write books such as this. Go ahead and read the book...We have nothing to hide...I just ask that you read something else afterward. Now if the author could back up his silly accusations, then that would be one thing. But since he can't, you're much better off reading something else. Try ""America in Prophecy"" and ""Desire of Ages"" if you're interested in serious Bible study, rather than a book full of fallacies and foolishness. Let the Bible alone be your guide. Thank you."
1,Study Bible + Study EGWhite = FREE,"Good day.I too grew up in a Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) home. I attended the SDA theological seminary one year, and after many years of studying the Bible and the Ellen G. White writings (her books are used as textbooks in their colleges), I discovered that no one who studies both, the Bible ""and"" the E.G. White books, is able nor capable of remaining in support of the Seventh-Day Adventist organization.The writer who posted the following statement reflects the fundamental reason why he/she supports the SDA:Quote: ""To be honest, I NEVER GO TO ELLEN WHITE FOR SPIRITUAL GUIDENCE OR ANYTHING ELSE. I'm good with my Bible,""Study, study, study,...""Let no one deceive you..."" Mathew 24.Noe L."
2,Cheap Construction,I returned this printer. It was light weight and the plastic was cheap. Plus it was an ugly blue that didn't match anything.
4,"the ""wrong color cartridge"" problem","There is a patch available from HP to deal with the problem of ""incorrect color cartridge.""I bought this model about two years ago. I had difficulty installing it with Mac OS 9, but eventually I succeeded. After some weeks, it started showing ""incorrect color cartridge,"" and I telephoned HP. After several calls, a person admitted that there was a problem and that a patch was needed. The HP person walked me through the patch installation, and I have had no problem since. You may need to be insistent with the HP person you get on the phone.As for getting the cartridge, if you live in an area where there is a Staples shop, you'll find the cartridges this printer needs. I find this printer to be economical with ink."
1,"""Tri-color cartridge not intended for use in this printer""","I followed HP's guidelines to correct this error, downloading the update, and cleaning(PPPlease! Don't blame a faulty product on us) and I still get this message. This printer is useless now. I agree with the other reviewers that this takes alot of ink and it won't even take my regular size photo paper. So it's not a good investment but is great if you're looking for a headache."
5,printer,i received the hp 2355 in one week and it works like new----am very happy with this----joe miller----would like to find more like this
5,love it. works great for linux.,We have one for our Ubuntu computer. This one is for my mother-in-law's Ubuntu computer. It's working great!
1,"When it does print, it prints well",But printing would require this printer to feed the paper through properly. Don't count on this printer working a good half of the time.
2,Scanner Issues,"I purchased this printer to replace 3 year old scanner that no longer had updated drivers for Windows XP. Decided to go with the all-in-one to save desk space as well as for the improved specs on the scanner that is part of the printer.However, I scanned about 100 family pictures and any pics with dark areas had visible rows that look like printhead lines going through the dark areas. I spent a lot of time and made numerous calls to HP's tech support with no avail. They finally agreed to send a replacement unit.The replacement unit came in and had the exact same issue. I called customer service again and literally had to argue for an hour to get someone to agree that sending another of the same model to me would probably not be satisfactory. Clearly experiencing the same problem on two machines is probably more of an issue with the hardware design and not a unique unit.So buyers, please be aware of the issue if you intend to do any scanning with the PSC 2355."
1,"Having problems with color, like others here",I got this printer for my family this past Christmas. I have found I have to go into the HP toolbox and clean the cartridge and prime it at least twice before it will print in color adequately. Then when I go to see how much ink is left....it's running out fast and I have printed very few documents w/ color....the priming really diminishes the ink but it's the only way I've found to get it to print in color. I'm really disappointed. Those color cartridges are NOT CHEAP!! I thought maybe I had a bad cartridge and was going to buy another but decided to check the reviews and see if others had the same problems first.....lo and behold....I'm not the only one.
1,Have to return - annoyed by service,"I read all the reviews of this all-in-one carefully, and even asked my tech support people at work to check that it would be compatible with my specific laptop. Then I bought it and was pretty excited - not for long. There were errors when installing the software (and trust me, I'm no dummy about this). Two chat sessions and several hours on the phone with HP didn't solve the problem. It took 4 (FOUR!!!) more calls before they agreed to send me another installation CD-Rom (for which HP was going to charge me...) and guess what, it's still not working. So now I have to return it, which means a) more of my own money spent, b) all the time I put into making it work is wasted, and c) I still don't have a printer! It sure looks gorgeous, and setup would have been a breeze if it wasn't for the CD-Rom errors. Now I'm majorly annoyed."
1,Junk,"If you run out of color or black, the printer/scanner will not work until the respective cartridge is replaced. This means that if you want to use merely as a scanner, you can't until both cartridges are new and working.I didnt print on this thing for about a year, and now that i've replaced the print cartidges i'm getting an error that the color cartridge needs replaced, even though I replaced it with a brand new one. So now this unit is useless and garbage."
2,Color printing stinks!,"I have had this all-in-one a short time and have had lots of problems getting it to print in color. At first, I thought I might have installed the printer software incorrectly, but I downloaded the updated driver from HP's web site and it still is not right. I was only able to successfully print out a doc with full color once. Usually, it print no color or partial color no matter what setting I use."
1,Mac owners stay away.,Absolutely nothing but problems for a mac user. Many bugs not worked out. Changing photo and regular print cartridges leads to 1) blank printouts 2) printouts where light blue and pink appear everywhere. Tech support no help. Ready to throw it away and go back to Epson.
1,Printer HP 1610 incompatiple with Mac Mini,"At intervals HP 1610 stops printing & error message ""out of paper"" appears, but paper is adequate. Efforts to begin printing again always results in a paper jam.HP customer service sent me a new 1610 which repeated the problem exactly.1610 will not feed paper when connected to Mac Mini OSX 10.3.9."
1,Buy something else,"In general it is good equipment BUT!!! When it is sunday 11:45 pm and you want to print out some B/W stuff for tomorrows class and right after you start the color cartridge runs out and the printer becomes useless, you forget all about the ""good equipment"" and want to throw the junk out of the nearest window. Even though my B/W cartridge is almost full, my students tomorrow won't have their handouts. HP is stupid for coming out with an interface like this. NEVER AGAIN HP..."
1,Disappointment,"We have had many good HP products and this one was a big disappointment. First of all, neither the copier or the scanner work, because of that you get frequent errors and it makes it difficult to even print things, so this printer has become an expencive book end."
3,"OK for Features, small scanning space for flatbed","Even my old HP Wal-Mart flatbed scanner had a larger scanning area. Sometimes I need to scan images (photos) that are 11X14 which is the size I usually shoot. I shoot a lot of pictures with film cameras. The scanning is a little slow, the printing especially with color photo paper and at higher resolution is v. slow. My next printer will definitely be larger scanning area, also good for scanning open books. But it does have that digital camera feature, where you can slip in the flash card media directly to the this printer/copier/scanner and you can bypass digital pix on your computer. The other thing that is great is that you can copy documents, but only 8 1/2 X 11 size!Downside: expensive color and black cartridges."
1,jams up constantly,"piece of crap. Jams up photo paper consistently no matter what kind of photo paper I use. If you have lots of money to blow to throw away photo paper, then this is the printer for you."
3,Decent all in one..,"i got this unit a few years ago. overall it does pretty good, love the scanner and extra features on this unit.there is one thing you should be aware of..the price of the ink cartridges! they are very expensive! and the cartridges themselves don't hold much ink.print out things sparingly, if you don't have alot of money to spend on cartridges. the included software is decent, it allows you to send emails out with pictures attached. (its alot easier and less time consuming if you use gmail though).overall, its a good printer. if the cartridges would last longer, it would be perfect."
1,Paper jams,"We purchased this all in one about eight months ago to replace another all in one from HP. Mainly bought the 2355 because it was smaller and had the integral media card reader. The software problems reading the media cards, short life ink cartidges and the yellow color copies have not annoyed me too much, but when it takes six sheets of paper to print a two page document that you need in a hurry, I am no longer pleased. The location and design of the paper feed roller are to blame, pulling the paper in on an angle. Quality control seems to be slipping at HP and I will think twice or more before buying another HP product."
1,Chronic olor print cartridge malfunction,"This was given to us as a gift December 2004. Within the first three months, an error message would come up to say that the wrong tri-color cartridge was installed though it was using the cartridge that CAME WITH THE PRINTER. I followed all the troubleshooting directions to no avail. Tech support was no help and a tremendous waste of my time. The only solution they could offer was for ME to go out and buy a new cartridge to see if that would solve the problem. It did, and they offered to send me a replacement cartridge which was fine. But now, four months later, I am getting the same error message. So I installed the new replacement cartridge and it is fine now. It is not a matter of the cartridge running out of ink, it just keeps clogging up. I would never buy a HP printer on my own."
1,color printing problems,"I bought 2 machines. Had to return the first. Both had the same exact problem. The color print did not print after the first initial set of print. If I printed a lot of 10 items, it printed gorgeous material. If i then printed something different lets say 5 minutes later, there was no color. This, as i mentioned, happened with both machines.Very unhappy with trust in printer, but when it did make copies, it was gorgeous."
2,Book review,Not at all pleased with condition of the book.......front corner is bent..........not worthy of its rating nor price quoted.........I will not make any further purchases from this supplier.
5,"Bravo, Marc!",I have played Marc's music and songs for my compatriots and agree with them that this is an inspired artist of great talent and heart. I hope that his CDs will be avialable soon in Italy because I beleive that his romantic overtones will be very successful in my country!
3,Educational,"This Chess set is great for those who want a challenge,and for those who would like to step up there game."
3,Ok,I had ordered this for my niece as a Christmas gift. I was confused on thinking it was one of the ones that talks to you. But It was my fault.
5,USB 2.0 Upgrade to an old laptop,"The USB 2.0 4-Port Cardbus works great. All my external USB 2.0 devices run at top speed. My Super G wireless network is FAST. I know that my old Sony Vio could have been replaced with a newer, faster computer. I just enjoyed the challenge of putting lipstick on my pig."
5,"Great movie, item as described and great condition.",I love this movie and was thrilled to find the movie in great condition and just as described and fast shipping. Loved it!
3,"Chuckle, Chuckle!","If you're looking for a quick, enjoyable read, with a few chuckles on the way, get this book. If you think the U.S. government has a unique outlook on life, this book proves it. ""Everyone Is Entitled To My Opinion"" is a small book with witty commentaries from ""This Week"" television show. The government is not the only oddity in the book. Life itself is seen as the intriguing, mysterious, comedic adventure it is. What I really liked about the book is you can read it in quick bites (on breaks at work) or for a longer visit (after dinner). David Brinkley's insight into the human condition is always enjoyable. And the fact his opinion often (but not always) is mine as well doesn't hurt. This is not GREAT LITERATURE (I was shouting there) but a very good book"
3,"Light, but amusing","There isn't really much to say about this book. It is charming, amusing and intelligent. Reading this book makes for an interesting trip down memory lane and reaffirms the old adage that ""the more things change, the more they remain the same.""The format is very simple and leads itself to a single read-through or picking a page at random. Several dozen of David Brinkley's closing statements on ""This Week with David Brinkley"" have been collected and presented here as short essays of no more than three pages each. If nothing else it is a pleasure to once again make fun of former Secretary of the Interior James Watt."
3,Even me,"A little book comprised of Brinkley's closing comments (selected) from THIS WEEK WITH... over about fourteen years. ""Broadcast,"" as he states in the introduction, ""in the hope of leaving our television audiences in a slightly better frame of mind than if we had left them with depressing thoughts of war, murder and drugs."" Most of these very short essays illuminate the fringes of Washington: deals and misdeeds, quirks in tax law, loony senators and presidential hijinks. A voice so familiar comes through in the writing, and Brinkley's odd inflection, dramatic pauses and ironic skepticism echo in memory as one reads. This is not the grand summation presented by Howard K. Smith in EVENTS LEADING UP TO MY DEATH (St. Martin's Press, 1996 ), but it is an ascerbic and witty insider's view from another of the fading handful of stars of the golden age of TV news."
4,A different approach,"I am one who feels that you have to have an open mind when watching this animated series from its inception. I (personally) like the ENTIRE series from season 1 - 5!! Of course, Season 1 might be the weakest, but it's still very good in my opinion. I love how they develop the character (obviously we are looking at a much younger/greener Bruce Wayne character). Over the years it develops and matures (he does as well as the writing and the series in general). I have been watching the entire series from start to finish and I am very pleased with it. This is coming from a die-hard fan of the original animated series. Quick shout out to the ""Brave and the Bold"" as well. All great Batman movies. You just have to have an open mind and understand that you are going to look at Batman (in any animated movie/series) from a different perspective."
2,"If this is Batman, then I'm the king of England.","Mutch like other movie and cartoon characters, Batman has been updated for the Matrix generation. The new show features very odd character designs. Especially the villians. The Joker for instance, one of my favorite comic bad guys has been reduced to a jamican Sideshow Bob rip-off. The show is lame compared to the original comics and the previous animation series. If Bruce Timm was dead, he would be spinning in his grave. The previous animated series lasted nearly ten years, while this ""thing"" will probably be gone after a couple of months. Small kids will probably not care, but adult or teenage fans should avoid it."
2,"Not so good, unfortunately","I was a fan of the campy ""Batman"" of the 60's. I loved Bruce Timm's vision in ""Batman: The Animated Series""; although the original episodes borrowed their look heavily from Tim Burton's movie, the characters were well-developed (consider the time spent introducing Two-Face or Mr. Freeze), and the series evolved over time to create an excellent atmosphere with great story-telling.Unfortunately, none of this is present in ""The Batman"". This series is mediocre in many regards - Bruce Wayne comes across as a weak, forgettable character, and the villains are nothing to write home about (although I did like the fact that they re-designed many of them, they just don't seem to work in any regard). The dialogue is inane as well.Not a strong offering..."
1,ALL 5 STARS!!!!!,"Here you go, FIVE Stars!1Star for the Show.1Star for the fans of this series.1Star for the animation.1Star for the voices.1Star for DC comics (They keep pushing this disaster on the fans! Wasn't Batman and Robin bad enough?)Why would any fan of Batman buy this Set? Save your money. Buy yourself TAS. A real Batman show."
1,Just what we need! More fake anime!,"The Batman is the latest in Kid's WB's unending crappy lineup trying to imitate anime. In a recent article promoting the equally awful-looking ""Loonatics"", a WB representitive says ""That's on purpose. Kids like anime."" Yes, some do, but that doesn't mean that you have to go out of your way to make sure that the stories are paper-thing, and that the characters all look like Pokemon rejects. Either the writers of the scripts are seriously talking down to the audience, something you should never do no matter who the audience is, or they're just idiots themselves. I suspect it's a mixture of both.In addition, this DVD collects a scant THREE, count them, THREE episodes for a price half of what many multi-disced box sets are. This release may eat your money, but at least it won't eat a lot of your time."
4,Good series,"Unlike many others I liked ""The Batman"" from the start. I just didn't like the remake of the Joker.It's hard not to compare it to BTAS though. The stories are not as in-depth as BTAS and I don't like the fact that Bruce Wayne will suite up as the batman in broad daylight. Batman doesn't do that. He loves the night. He is the night."
2,"not a great show, but still one of the better cartoons that are on today","I am a MONSTER fan of the original animated series, and I am done trying to force myself to watch this show. The animation is better than the old series, but batman beyond is almost as good as this."
1,Blasphemy!,"This mess is most certainly NOT Batman! Why take a rich, intimidating character like Bruce/Bats and turn him into a boring twit as this show does?? And the villians...HA! What a joke! They are drawn in a ridiculous manner and their backstories are completely washed-out and replaced with mind-numbing stupidity. The Joker? Why does he wear no shoes? Bane? Why is he blood red? Mr. Freeze? Why take away his Nora and replace him with only being a diamond thief? Poison Ivy? Going to college with Batgirl? And why do we even need a Batgirl to begin with?!?!?! I shudder to think what will happen with Scarecrow, Mad Hatter, Harley Quinn when they get their episodes. Oh and can we lay off the Penguin for awhile? In other words this show is BORING!"
4,A fine show...,"I gave the series 4 stars.I like the direction the writers are going with this series.The animation is sharp.I loved the old BTAS, and I believe this series complements the old Batman series well."
3,DECENT AT BEST,I LIKE THE NEW BATMAN SERIES BUT THEY FLUBBED ON A COUPLE THINGS SUCH AS MAKING BRUCE MORE HARDER BUT I GUESS THAT COMES WITH AGE AND EXPEREINCE PLUS I THINK THIS ONE IS TOO COLORFUL AND CERTAIN VILLIANS SUCH BANE DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT AND DON'T OCCUR TIL BATS IS IN HIS PRIME ANYWAYS. OVER ALL IT'S A 3 STARS
4,Breath of fresh air,"Throughly enjoyed this fresh re-imagining of The Batman, the voice work, design, music and execution is first rate. My children love it too and (whispered) ""the Batman"" is now a staple catchphrase in our house. Looking forward to the second season. Pity it's not in widescreen 'cause it looks so cool."
3,"Good, but some legit complaints...","""The Batman"" does have issues. Weak, poorly developed characters, a more modern style that sometimes causes the characters faces to bend into unusual and un-natural shapes as they move from frontal to profiled views.On the whole though the show does produce some impressive visuals.My major complaint is that each episode is barely 20 minutes long, counting the opening and closing sequences. This probably says more about the state of modern 1/2 hour television than it does the show, but it does answer a lot of the complaints.It's hard to have character development, plot and story in only 20 minutes."
2,Formulaic Saturday Morning Fare,"If you're looking for something groundbreaking like B:TAS or ""The New Batman Adventures,"" you'll have to look elsewhere. ""The Batman"" is nothing new. In fact, it's the kind of Saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80's. This re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great. No longer are the villains multi-layered and complex; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero. Further, Batman mythos mainstay James Gordon is abandoned in favor of two ""hipper"" more ""kid-friendly"" replacements that serve the same function. On the plus side, the animation is good; but it is still not enough to make up for the series' shortcomings. I understand the second season was better, but if so, they must have made some major changes. All in all, a disappointment."
1,This show is horrible.,"Batman is supposed to be the dark knight. This show reminds me of the Batman movies of the 90's which made batman ""happier"" and more ""friendlier"". The dialog is also lacking for this show as well. Plus I don't buy the excuse that the reason that this show is dumbed down is because its for kids. The original batman cartoon had just as many toys and had just as many kids watching it and still managed to pull off excellent characterization, intelligent dialog and a great story. You actually felt for the characters. Plus, you don't need to have seen the original animated series or even be a fan to see that 1.)this show is plagued with horrible dialog. 2.) batman is mis-characterized and 3.) that theres absolutely no depth to this series or any of the characters. Just my 2 cents on this show, but go ahead and watch the show and make your own judgement."
1,KIDS HATE THIS SHOW!,"This version of Batman is for morons! My 12 years old cousin came to my house to stay in Christmas week. He told me that he watch this miserable show on TV. He told me about the atrocities that criminal producer Sam made with Batman.I told him that I have Batman cartoons in my DVD stand and he told me he wanted to watch it. Immediately, I picked up my two seasons of the 90's Batman TAS serie and my four animated movies for him to watch. So I put him to watch the first season of Batman TAS. And guess what? He LOVED IT! He also told me he wanted a copy! He told me as we was watching ""Uncle, I like this cartoons more than the ones on TV"".Do yourself a favor: avoid like the plague this DVD and buy a Scooby Doo cartoon for your kid, instead of this. He will thank you."
4,We Finally Have all the e Seasons,My little one is just a big superhero fan. My teenager is not any different. This movie was in excellent condition and provides hours of entertainment for all the different ages in my home. I would definitely use this seller again.Thank you!!
3,Decent item. OK for smaller child with Batman cartoons.,"My four year old really wanted a 'Batman' video from Santa, for Christmas. After researching on line for something mildly appropriate for him, rather impresionable, so it fits the bill. Cinamatically speaking it is not so illustrious. Price was right as was actual product condition, except for ripped DVD cover but isn't so bad overall."
1,No jokes from the Joker,This is the worst version of Batman that I have seen lo these many years. The villians are not themselves. And the lack of puns is lamentable. Disapointing.
3,"Not as good as BTAS,but I respect it for what it is.","I am much more of a fan of the original Batman series,but this series isnt bad either. The original Batman was not dumbed down for kids(like the spider man series.)IT DIDNT HAVE LASER GUNS.I didnt expect much after I heard about this show. After BTAS, you just dont need another Batman series, but I was surprised. If you want the cool stylized film noir Batman, get the three box sets,but if you are fine about a step down from the seriousness of the first series,get this. It's only three episodes(WHOOPDY DOO),but it's afine series. Just dont expect too much."
1,Corrupting Our Children,"Bruce Hale encourages violance and judgemental attitudes. As a teacher, there is no way I would allow my students to read this book."
3,Richard Gere: Body better than words,"When you read an unauthorized bio, don't set yourself up for a disappointment. This book was. It covers the basic facts with a candycoating of media salesmanship. Terrible, but it got a three for the photograph on the cover."
5,Black and Blond more than worth it...,"I love the original Tonight and the Rest of My Life track--Nina Gordon's voice is more amazing than usual when she sings that song. The remix on this track was a little disappointing, however. Don't get me wrong, Nina's voice is still so rich that you could wrap yourself in it, but the techno sounds in the remix really detracted from a great song. The feature that really makes this single worth the $$ you shell out is the Black and Blond track. Wow! It unlike any of the stuff from Tonight or her Veruca Salt days. I hope to hear more stuff like this on her new album. Buy this single now!"
3,"OK, but slightly disappointing","We bought it about a year ago. My wife thinks it's OK, but it is less fast than the non-rechargeable trains. Those are more fun! The train derails more often, as stated earlier. I think that might be due to uneven weight on the wheels, because of the battery.It's definitely not as nice to play with as with the normal ones, and I'm not being picky!"
2,The little train that COULD NOT!!!,We bought this train because it was a Brio and we are very disappointed. It constantly derails. We are very unhappy with BRIO for making such a Bad Product.
2,Limited to a dozen big cities.,"Like the description for this book says, there IS more to queer Europe that gay Paris. Unfortunately this book only hits on 7 other countries, so if you're headed anywhere in Scandinavia, forget it. Same with Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland, and a bunch of other European countries. Make sure you're going to one of the Chosen 8, or this book will be worthless."
3,"nice shape and size, dull color","I like the shape and size of the bowl and believe it will be a useful serving dish. The colors are nowhere near as bright as the images on the website. The red is more of a dull burgundy, the black is not quite fully black."
5,specs on the spark plug gap is incorrect,"The haynes manual states that the spark plugs should be gapped to between 0.024 & 0.028...but in recent years, it was found that a gap of 0.032 to 0.037 works optimally with the stock ignition.Overall it's an excellent book & tool if your interested in maintaining your 320i."
2,FASHION DEN,"THIS WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL. IN FACT, I DISLIKED IT SO MUCH I GAVE IT TO A THRIFT SHOP! THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL ""MODERN"" ABOUT THIS FILM. OBVIOUSLY, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
3,The Logic of Failure,"The frailty of human cognition is exposed and cleanly flayed by Dietrich Dorner (1996) in The Logic of Failure. As we face our flawed intellectual inheritance, we still have a right to feel elated because a weakness exposed is a weakness conquered. Dorner in Failure, indeed, gives us the tools to change our prescription from one of failure and well-intentioned catastrophe to one of humble vision and wisdom. Dorner has written no less than the formula for common sense. Failure resonated with me over and over again. Often, we bumble through life and occasionally, if we are very lucky, we have a few moments where suddenly ignorance is sloughed off and the worldview is changed with a mighty clap. It's the, of course, that's why that happened. Why didn't I see it sooner? Why didn't they see it sooner? With Dorner's work at last we have an explanation for why good people make big mistakes and more importantly a guide to avoid them."
4,worth reading if you deal w/complexity,"the title of this book (plus a reference in another book) intrigued me, despite my scepticism about all-purpose ""why do people fail"" books.in fact, this is a very practical and thought-provoking book about what approaches lead to success/failure in managing complex systems (think: a large corporation, a city, complex political issues). inevitably a book like this must generalize but the observations are based on real examples."
1,Meh.,"Things are complex. Watch the behaviors of items in a system closely. Get a computer to model the cause and effect relationships. Things don't always respond like you would expect. That's the book in a nutshell... I ended up speed reading the book instead of word for word because I couldn't handle all of the excessive examples, nor the continued reference back to his computer simulation ""real"" models (and I *like* computers!)."
3,Use common sense,"This book was clearly written and provided a great deal of food for thought. There are several useful concepts described here and I am glad I read the book. I recognized many of the habits and weaknesses in my own thought patterns. However, I was a little disappointed that the final analysis seemed to be: ""learn common sense"" from experience, perhaps by engaging in computer simulations of decision making. With so many interesting ideas presented throughout the book, I had expected something more profound in the final chapter."
4,Covers Some New Ground on a Critical Topic,"I am totally fascinated at how people acting with good intentions can actually make things worse, the Law of Unintended Consequences. I still want to read some Robert K. Merton who I think identified that law, but in the meantime, this book takes some steps toward figuring it out. I found the experimental portions to be a little dry, but I liked what he learned from them. The main thing I'll remember is how people can be guilty of ""ballistic thinking"". No, not exposive thinking, but more like shooting from the hip and not being able to adjust the flight of a bullet. With thinking it should be possible."
5,A book that will make you wiser,I read this book years ago and have been recommending it ever since. I always think it is better to learn from other's mistakes instead of your own and this book goes a long way in achieving this. This book has given me new insights to problems I have faced. I have relied too much on logic to solve problems in the past and now take the time to get all of the facts before I go ahead with a solution. The book also does a great job in explaining people's actions which at times make no sense.
2,Not very helpful to advanced users.,"I bought this book in the hopes that I would learn from it, but all the contents are very basic. I am very disappointed in the types of questions involved. Don't buy if you are an advanced user."
2,Ok...but not great,"I didn't realize that this movie is basically all in German with english subtitles. Second, it is mostly about Erik Zabel. Yes, the scenary is nice and the music is good, but I wouldn't buy it again nor would i watch it again."
3,Good movie for the hardcore biking fan.,It was okay. I was expecting more excitement and was a little disappointed. I'm a biking fan and still enjoyed it. I liked Overcoming a little bit more.
3,Does It Work? Hmmm...,"This stuff is suppose to be helpful for those on statins or heart failure. I have been taking these for a month, but cannot tell if they are helping or not. Course, there is no way to tell until the next visit to the doctor or echo. I asked the cardiologist: he recommended 100mg daily and that it is well tolerated by patients. I read several clinical studies about it, and the results were not consistent. I had 2 concerns:1) Is it bio-available? If you take it, is it absorbed by the body? It is an unregulated supplement, so this is not a given. The studies, however, showed that the levels in the body do increase measurably.2) Cost: these things ain't cheap. It is safe, but chances are good that it doesn't really help, but it might, a little. So, I have no objection to taking it, as long as you do not have to pay too much, so shop around. Note especially the price per dose."
2,No advantages measured,"I took this supplement a few months, but saw no benefits and it expensive so I won't buy again."
3,"Great product, but overpriced.","I bought this because the vitamin packet that I used to take has been discontinued, and I couldn't find another packet that included this supplement. I just found this supplement at Costco for less than half this price!"
5,Execellent Practical Virbation Manual,"This is an excellent book for people faced with practical vibration problems. The book is a well-written to this topic. Focus is on rotating machinery, and data acquistion, filtering, etc. This is the best 1st book on vibration diagnosing I've found yet. A definite recommend to buy"
5,I purchased this for gifts,I liked this so much I had buy extra to give as gifts. Take the time to read the long positive reviews on this album... I agree with what they voice; a very moving collection of songs.
5,Worked Great To Clear Our Jam!,"Thought we needed a new garbage disposal when our garbage disposal stopped working. Went to a hardware store to buy a new one, and spotted this JamBuster wrench there. Bought the JamBuster Wrench, put it in the garbage disposal at the bottom where it fits in, and turned it a number of times back and forth. Didn't really think it would solve the problem, but was very surprised when I turned on the switch, the disposal turned on, and now works great!"
4,Wrench works well,"I used regular wrench but was unable to fix the insinkerator. However, after I tried this wrench, maybe the angle of it made it easier to turn."
4,A bit of sand...,"Well...this wrench works very well, however a broom handle works very well too. Try it before you purchase this wrench. You might be pleasantly surprised."
5,Best product that costs so little,This product cocts so little and saved me the big cost of having a plummer come to my home. It arrived quickly and did exactly what I was told it would!
1,who the heck is Jo-Jo Franco?,"Poorly written account of the life of Joseph Franco, basically spends the whole book tooting his own horn. He is ""friends"" with every one from politicians to movie celebrities...do we care? Other than using Jimmy Hoffa's name in the title to boost sales, the actual book has very little to do with JH."
1,"poorly written ""fairy tale""","What a disappointment! I managed to make it through 5 chapters before throwing it into the living room wall. I have read my share of mafia/organized crime books and for the most part if they are written by ex cops, or crime writers, they are usually well written. Unfortunately that cannot be said for those written by the ""figures"" themselves, and this little collection of ""tall tales"" is no exception. I simply couldn't find anything believable. Franco would have you believe that the labor wars were won with a stick of dynamite at every turn. The book reads like a John Wayne script, except this time Wayne is the ""bad guy"" getting the best of every situation. The only consolation is that I bought it used. And it's getting cool even in Texas, nothing like a little kindling for the fireplace."
1,Does NOT pass simple credibility test,"After reading only the first chapter, I reluctantly decided to close the book. It is simply not believable."
1,"Cheap foam, poor fit.","Although the fit is supposed to be universal, this did not fit my seats on my 2003 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport (I know, it's a mouthful. Love the car, but the name is a bit long). The photo is misleading as to how the headrest cover works. It looks like it can attach to large headrests, but the photo shows it in an ""unsecured"" state. To have the flap that covers the headrest stay in place, it has to wrap all the way under and make contact with a velcro section on the inside of the headrest flap. It does not use elastic straps like the rest of the cover/cushion.Even if it had fit, I would still have returned it. The foam is very cheap and offers no real cushioning and will only compress with time.The ""lumbar pillow"" offers no real support. I bought it for lumbar support and it was honestly useless for this purpose."
3,Does not fit for HONDA ELEMENT,This item would have been good had it fit the Element. Its a simple decent cover.The elastic straps on the side blocks the seat belt from functioning.This will be returned shortly
3,Sport Trax Review 11042 b section 2,"The seat cover is decent, it seems to keep its shape fairly well. I've had it in place for about 1 month. I only ordered one for the driver (me) to try before ordering the second. The jury is still out whether or not I will do so. I'm just not sure how durrable it will be in the long run."
3,Can't fit on my Toyota 2010 Camry,The Wagan 2291 Sport Trax Seat Cushion is comfortable and easy to fit.the only problem is can't cover and hold top the seat. the top connect line is too short.
1,Little to add to the Sherlock canon,"We hear that Carr undertook this project as a short story to add to the Sherlock Holmes history, but at book length it is little more than a minor tale puffed into too many pages. The result is a dry, unnuanced mystery that hardly seems to come from the author of the excellent ""Alienist."" That far more exciting read from ten years ago is recommended; better to give this one a pass."
1,Arthur Conan Doyle is SPINNING in his Grave,"Until now, Sherlock Holmes stories have been thrillers. Caleb Carr's new novel is, however, a crushing bore--a thrill-less Holmes thriller, if you will. There is tons of TALKING and very little ACTION. Well, you get the picture. The first 100 pages are background material. And Carr's prose is so dense and convoluted; I'm really having trouble concentrating on the story, it's so dry and wordy. (And you've got to giggle at the author's ""poseur"" photo on the back cover, replete with a bad '90s-grunge look...and a shotgun!)There are many other authors who have taken the Sherlock Holmes' stories to new heights. I highly recommend Laurie R. King's series. They're amazing. ""The Italian Secretary,"" however, is a waste of good reading time."
1,Not the Holmes of Conan Doyle,"This book was extremely disappointing. Holmes' famous ability to make deductions based on observation is almost totally absent. The few attempts are ludicrous. See particularly the mystery of Queen Victorias's tooth extraction and the ""observations"" leading to the identification of the plainclothes military escort. The plot was ridiculous. The villian(s) shallow and poorly developed. The detection leading to the identification of the villians poorly developed. The supernatural aspect(s) of the novel did not work. I admire the previous work of Caleb Carr. This one astonished me."
3,"Impeccable imitation, unremarkable plot","As much as I *loved* Caleb Carr's first two books, I couldn't even finish this one. I got about a third of the way through and gave up when the supreme revelation to date was that Her Majesty the Queen had a tooth pulled. I'm sure it got better, but judging from some of the other reviews, not that much. I'm hoping my father will stick with it longer than I did since he is a Holmes fan of the highest degree. As a Caleb Carr fan, I'm hoping for a return to his original characters and style."
2,I'm cured,"Although I love the original Holmes stories that I read growing up, invariably I am disappointed when I try one of the Holmes stories written by others. Being a fan of mysteries with supernatural overtones, I thought I would try this. But I gave up long before the ghost (or whatever) was introduced -- before they even arrived in Scotland, in fact. Talk, talk, talk, even when there was some action. This has convinced me to reread Doyle's books if I am in the mood for a Sherlock Holmes story, and not try any of the imitators."
2,Thriller? Not quite!,"I was so excited to order Carr's new novel. While not a huge Holmes fan, I am a fan of Carr's work. What a disappointment the Italian Secretary turned out to be. With little or no dramatic tension, even this short novel felt like an unending tome. Carr does an excellent job recreating the time period, but the character development is flat. In the end, you simply don't care if the characters live or die, let alone who is the guilty party. Please - back to the Alienist and the drama within!"
3,Not a great book if your mind keeps wandering,"Longing for more Sherlock Holmes and unable to get satisfaction from the source, we must content ourselves with pale imitations. Some of them are better than others. This one lands smack in the middle.I found my mind wandering on a few scattered pages, as I read some interminable, clunky, non-light-producing paragraph. That has never once happened while I was reading Arthur Conan Doyle. A lot of explanations were stuffed rather unceremoniously into the dialogue, when they could have been revealed more expertly, I would think. I mean, it's Caleb Carr! My expectations were high.Not a bad book ... a fair offering to the canon.Ah, Arthur ... we miss you."
2,Not what I expected,"I wanted to like this book... I really did.I loved Carr's ""The Alienist"" and ""The Angel of Darkness"".I am also a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes - not just the originals, but pastiches and parodies as well. However, I was very disappointed with this story. It never drew me in and I didn't feel anything for the characters. I didn't even feel like finishing it, but I did, just in case it got better in the end. It didn't. I'm still a Caleb Carr fan though, and look forward to his next book."
5,Sherlock Holmes in Scotland,"I find the ""unknown"" adventures of Sherlock Holmes very interesting, and try to read them whenever I find a book about him. This latest effort, done by an experienced novelist whom I have read in the past, sends Holmes and Watson, at the request of Mycroft Holmes, to the Scottish residence of Queen Victoria to solve two grisly murders. The plot abounds with strange and mysterious characters, red herrings galore, and a rather garrolous Holmes. There's also the slightest hint of supernatural involvement, which makes it only all the more interesting. I hope Mr. Carr attempts further Holmes adventures, for they will be well worth reading."
1,Curiously disappointing my dear Holmes....,"And I enjoyed Mr. Carr's 'The Alienist' & 'Angel of Darkness'. My joy at being presented with a new Carr offering, one featuring Sherlock Holmes no less, was mitigated by his over the top attempt at what I call ""The Victorian Style"" of writing. Dickens & Conan Doyle did it so well....Mr. Carr does not. I gave up on the story about a third of the way in. If you've never read Caleb Carr before then skip this book and pick up 'The Alienist'. You'll be glad you did."
2,Not up to Mr. Carr's snuff.,"I read about half of this novel and, I must say, it was more plodding than enjoyment. I really enjoyed The Alienist and, only a little less, The Angel of Darkness. The Italian Secretary was not up to this level, especially considering it featured Holmes and Watson. Portrayed here they were dry and shallow, and I simply couldn't embrace them. What little action happened in the first half of the book did not ignite my usual passion for a Sherlock Holmes story."
3,A Palaverous Yak-Fest,"What began as a promising adventure turned into a long, slow ride on the verbosity train. Fun quickly turned to FEH!"
3,It's O.K.,"I just can't say I loved this book. I've enjoyed other novels of Carr's (The Alienist, Angel of Darkness), and I read this book quickly; I'm also a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes' stories. It was technically well written & researched, and I really wanted to love it, but ultimately, I think I just can't buy the super-natural element in a Holmes' story. Besides me being a stickler for the original stories, I found the sections covering the ""super-natural"" awkward and un-satisfying."
3,If you must have some new Holmes . . .,"This is a tolerable facsimile of the great consulting detective in action, but the cold London rain lashing the windows of 221B Baker Street and the clatter of the solitary hansom in Oxford Street late at night are considerably missing from Caleb Carr's attempt at a Sherlock Holmes tale. The need to fill a book may be what caused a yarn that the great detective's creator would have dispatched in 20 to 25 pages to be frustratingly long on chitchat and short on action - e.g., a train ride from London to Edinburgh takes 54 pages, although momentarily enlivened by a foiled bomb attack. Caleb Carr has the Doyle style down but produces only a semblance of Sherlock Holmes. Missing are the amazing turns of deduction that Doyle's fans awaited eagerly in the latest issues of The Strand magazine. However, if you've read and re-read the original canon till it holds no more delights, this is not a bad read."
2,Just wouldn't get going...,"I am an enormous fan of all things Sherlock Holmes, so I had high hopes for this story. Unfortunately, so much time was taken ""fixin' to start to begin"" as my Texan brothers say, that my mind went numb, and as I fell into a coma my head hit the stop button on my iPod, thus stopping this incessant drivel, waking me from oblivion. 'nuf said..."
2,320 page book that was 160 pages too long,"A fair story, but the author seemed too preoccupied with semantics rather than actual plot; in other words, too wordy and unfocused sentence structure that overshadowed the actual moments of action. Doyle could have made this a short story."
3,Looking for a thriller?,"Thought I would really like this book, being a fan of mysteries in general and Caleb Carr in particular. But maybe I'm just not smart enough for Holmes. I found myself pretty bewildered much of the time. Like Watson, I was puzzled over how the great detective could ferret out a line of reasoning from relatively little evidence. I was hoping for more gritty action and psychological thrills, I suppose--something more akin to Carr's other books. I'm not sure I ever really understood the end, either--are we supposed to believe there was a supernatural power at work, or that the only supernatural power lives in the mind of the masses? I guess if you're a devotee of Sherlock Holmes, you'll like it. It just wasn't for me."
4,Very fun read,"Being a huge fan of Caleb Carr and the Sherlock Holmes mysteries I was very excited to get this book. I was not disappointed. The book is fast paced, witty, and suspenseful. Other Customer critics appear to have read the book with a prejudice. This is not, nor does it claim to be, a book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And Caleb Carr did not write the book in the same formula as he wrote The Alienist or The Angel of Darkness. But it was done very well. I look forward to reading further adventures if Caleb writes them."
2,Not the Sherlock Holmes We Know and Love,"There are a few people who have been able to match the genius of Arthur Conan Doyle when trying to write Sherlock Holmes books. Sadly Caleb Carr is not one of them. His portrayals of Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft Holmes and Dr. Watson are far wordier than any of the characters ever were in the book, and their protracted conversations are too complicated (and boring) to follow.I quit the book about halfway through as it was not holding my interest. Because I wanted to give Carr credit for at least trying a different character than the one he made famous in The Alienist, I'm giving this two points instead of one, but if you want to read a Sherlock Holmes story, pull out your Arthur Conan Doyle books and read from the pen of the master."
4,Holmes will figure it out,"For those of us who love Sherlock Holmes this is a real treat. A telegram from Sherlock's brother Mycroft arrives from Scotland asking for help. Mycroft, royal advisor to Queen Victoria explains to Holmes and Watson that there have already been two servants brutally murdered and an attempt has been made on his and the queen's lives. Are Scottish nationalists responsible for the deaths? Or could it be the work of a restless ghost? Those of us who are familiar know for sure Sherlock Holmes will figure it out in the end.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry, author of the contemporary romance, ""Set Me Free"" series Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com."
2,Silly,"The Italian Secretary has a silly premise, gee whiz language, and it turns Holmes and Watson into cartoon characters. The book reads like the fever dream of a teenager."
1,Very Disappointing,"""The Italian Secretary"" is a failure both as a novel and a pastiche.Carr's attempt to capture the flavor of Doyle's prose flounders amid a flood of long-winded and boring verbiage.Holmes himself comes across as an arrogant, insensitive know-it-all while poor Watson is reduced to an obsequious, thick-headed toadie.There is no real depth to any other characters, who come and go like cardboard cut-outs.The story starts out at a snail's pace and doesn't really get going until about half way through.At that point the author makes it fairly obvious who the true culprit is, making the rest of the tale rather anticlimactic.In the hands of a less floridly verbose author this might have made a good short story.As it is, it is a struggle to read."
2,Strong on atmosphere short on substance,"I just finished this novel and I have to say it was not as good as I thought it would be. Caleb Carr takes the Holmes novels and puts his own spin on recreating a new adventure. For Caleb his writing style is both intricate and deft, but that was all. The Mystery was neither hard to crack or exciting. This is a novel dealing with the residence of the Queen of Scots in the 1870's, Holmes and Watson are summoned to solve to murders and along the way we find out clues and interesting characters as to why the murders occurred, even thought he novel was short is seemed endless. I know many people will like the Holmes atmosphere which this novel is strong with, but I just didn't think there was enough here to satisfy my interest."
2,"I slept, I turned over, I slept","I love Caleb Carr's books. I am reasonably attracted to Sherlock Holmes. Why do I find this book plodding, top heavy and a general all around snooze? Carr got the flavor right; the language and tone are impeccable. But he seems to have spent all his energy developing his dialogue facsimile and forgotten that detective stories were supposed to be exciting (sometimes even Conan Doyle's). On the merits alone of creating such an able carbon copy I give Carr points, but this book is almost unreadable for any other reason."
2,Preferred other Carr works,"I picked up the hardcover since I loved THE ALIENEST and ANGEL OF DARKNESS by Caleb Carr. The author weaves a tale about Conan Doyle's beloved famous Sherlock Holmes.I'm a little tired of Holmes' brother Mycroft showing up in Holmes fiction. The settings are atmospheric, and the Victorian time period involving. But overall the plot plods along so slowly it was like watching grass grow to get through it.Carr doesn't come close to Conan Doyle's amazing talent of crafting a complex intelligent mystery. Nor impressing us with Holmes' wicked skills of reason and deduction. Things are just sort of figured out or come to light and it's all rather unsatisfying to the reader.Then just when it got a little good, the novel is over.Recommended: Laurie R. King's Mary Russell & Sherlock Holmes series"
2,Not even close to Mr. Doyle,This did not hold my interest very well .. which says it all for a mystery fan. Slow developing and plot rambles quite a bit. Author tries to combine both the metaphysical beliefs of Sir Doyle with Sherlock and it does not work.
1,"Rubbish, my dear Watson, rubbish!","Is this the same man that wrote The Alienist, Killing time, etc? Unbelievable! What a waste of time and paper. This book is not a pastiche, it is a disgrace. Tedious, boring, infantile, with absolutely nothing in common with the image of Sherlock Holmes and/or Dr. Watson. What a pity Mr. Carr decided to turn away from the stories he writes so wonderfully. He should be ashamed of this .... thing out of his pen. In Spanish, we have a saying: Shoemaker, to your shoes. Enough said."
2,Boredom Abounds,"I've never read a Sherlock Holmes novel so if the excercise of this book was to get as close to the original as possible yet provide a new adventure for the old slueth and his fans, then I have no idea if the author accomplished his mission. But if I were reading this for pure entertainment, as I was, then I'd have to say that this book was a real yawner. The best thing to say about it was that it was relatively short. I just don't see Sherlock having any relevance in todays world. His deductive reasoning, his thinking process and jumps of reasoning are talked out with his sidekick Watson, and seem like self-fulfilled prophesies. He deduces it so it must be true. I'd like to see him be so wrong that the result is somebody close to him bites the bullet."
5,BLACK MAN'S RELIGION,I would like to thank the two authors Gleen Usry & Craig S. Keener for writting Black Man's Religion. I truely enjoyed reading the book. I had to read the book for a class. I feel that everybody should read this book. I would like to thank the authors for writting such a great book.
1,Absolutely worthless,"This product does nothing if you make your own decals with decal paper. It is supposed to help ""melt"" the decal onto your application. It was about as useful as water. Save your money."
5,Good Product,"These things store much more easily than the round bumpers and stay put on the side of the boat with no ""rolling up"" on the dock from the wave action rocking the boat."
5,Works....,It does what it advertises! very solid tool. greater for that router table that doesn't quite extent to where you want it to.
1,I cannot use it. Does not come with wrench. Thanks for telling me!!!!!,"No wrenches included and I have NO clue what size(s) to use. My regular router wrenches are to small. Wish I would have ordered the MCLS, as it comes with everything you need, and is almost $10 cheaper. Does not say in description that wrenches are not included. Wasted money....maybe when I finally figure out what to do, I will give better review."
1,No safety instryctions,"As this product will hold a fairly heavy router bit spinning at 16,000 rpm, I would have thought they could have printed the safety instructions in english. Four other languages, but not english."
1,Risky Business,"Using an extension on a shaft spinning at 15 to 20K+ RPM is a 'high-risk' operation. Even with a perfectly balanced adapter, the increase in the length of the shaft will place a greater lateral load on the bearings and the shaft, possibly resulting in a catastrophic failure (think 'ballistic'). Every router I've ever owned (6 or more) or used is designed for wrench access from the side not from the bottom (or 'top' in an inverted position). Your router table should allow this access negating the need for an extension (unless the base plate is not flush with the tabletop). If you must use an adapter make sure it's quality tool and use only a very sharp bit."
1,shipping nightmare,cannot adequately rate this product. ordered it 12-29-09 and as of 2-2-10 still have not recieved it.
4,be careful of the sizing!,"Great product, be careful of the sizing, some of these are a little big for the cameras/phones they are supposed to be for."
5,Experimental greatness from the master,"Includes a 20 minute track of experimental musique concrete soundcapes. Strange and scary at times, like a gohst in the night. Hardly mellodic. Surprising and genius."
2,PANDORA'S EMPTY BOX,"The ubiquitous director Jim Wynorski is back with another prefab, lackadaisical entry. Daniel Baldwin stars as a crack special operative called upon to ring in a renegade agent played listlessly by Richard Tyson. Tyson is in possession of Pandora, some kind of weapon of mass destruction which can be used in restricted areas, kill the people but leave everything else intact. It never says exactly how it kills anyone, but the writers must have thought that unimportant. At any rate, nothing surprising happens, and the supporting players, including Steve Franken, Tony Todd and even Erika Eleniak are wasted in poorly written roles. The climax is pretty lame considering Baldwin's character was never told how the Pandora device works but he uses it like it was an old friend. Tired, been there done that before movie."
3,Good book on film editing but dated approach,"Having taken courses on film making back in the day I know how important editing is to the filmaker's vision and final product. My instructor used clips of Bullit and a few Alfred Hitchcock films to make his points and illustrate great film editing. This book takes me back to that time and that is good and bad. It presents all of the elements of editing but is not updated for today's students. When I took my film making course in high school those were films of the day. This book should have been updated with examples of contemporary films (with pictures in color). Also, it would have been great to include a cd with the book, especially at this price. It should also have been updated to include computer editing tools that are so prevelant today."
4,FILM EDITING,"Even though I reminisced the days of editing my Super 8mm home movies, this guide will easily extrapolate to the era of video editing since the techniques are very similar. A useful basic guide for the rookie and slightly experienced film editor."
5,the only book on film editing worth reading,"This book remains, after all these years, the only film editing manual from which one can glean veritably useful insights. After a twenty-four year career in Hollywood as film editor and another twelve as film editing teacher at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where it is used as textbook for all editing students, I keep returning to Reisz and Millar for their never-aging insights and wisdom, their precise language and savvy film history, their representative selection of films. A must-read for beginner and professional alike, or anyone who wants to understand movies from inside out.Julian SemilianFilm Editing and Sound Design FacultyUniversity of North Carolina School of the ArtsSchool of Filmmaking"
5,Bible of Film Editing,Bible of Film Editingfrom an editor and editing professor-editors must have it- simple as that-- would be wise for other filmmakers to read too
3,I don't get it,"3 stars may not be fair. I misunderstood what I was reviewing. I was looking for help with amateur video and digital photography. If you're a film student, this isd for you. The rest of us mortals need to look elsewhere."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"The title of this book should be ""Termites and Borers: An AUSTRALIAN Homeowner's Guide to Detection and Control"" -- this book is for Australians. Furthermore, the book reaffirmed my belief that exterminators maintain a shroud of secrecy around the truths of their profession in order to propagate the public fear of insect infestation. The book did contain a few worthwhile facts, but not as many as can be found by typing ""termite"" into your favorite Internet search engine."
5,King Lear has never been THIS entertaining,"Shakespeare is quite arguably the greatest writer to have ever lived. His characters and imagery, the simplicity and complexity of storyline, are unmatched. For anyone interested in seeing deep inside one of his greatest works, the search is over. This is IT! Mr. McCallum has captured 'King Lear' with a completely unique take. Humor - Wit - A clear modern vision. Sandy McCallum.... Thank you! I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Awesome Griptilian,This is a great knife. It fits in my pocket and is perfect for all my needs. The fact that the manufacturer will sharpen the knife is what really made the decision for me. The quality of the product is great. I lost the one I received last year for my birthday and felt naked without it... so I replaced it.
1,horrible waste of money,"This is cheaply made, narrator does not say player's names, footage is bad. I could not watch more than five minutes. What a terd! Not worth even a nickel. Skip it, Noles' fans."
4,Music that doesn't shout,"I really like this album. These musicians have some wit and good musical sense. The vocals are a bit muddy, though, for my taste."
2,All Night Halloween Party is an all night flop,This has a few 50s and 60s B Horror movie trailers and a mixed bag of older cartoons that are sort of scary in content but nothing has a Halloween theme in any way. The cover is the only thing related to Halloween on this title. Some of the cartoons and old stop motion animation stuff are kind of fun but they are just not in any way related to Halloween. You are better off to purchase something that you know has Halloween related content on it for the kids. The run time is only a bit over an hour so it's just not worth the purchase. All Night Halloween Party is an all night flop in my eyes.
5,Great resource,"My wife is looking at where she wants to get her MSW, and this book was a tremendous help! It does a great job of explaining the process, as well as providing valuable reference information."
2,Not very good.,"they run really big. the don't look as good as they do in the picture. the soles feel like plastic there is no support for ankles. Not a very good boot, plus they smell weird."
3,middle of nowhere,These boots meet military regulation and are cheap. It's a good product for the price. The ones I bought 4+ months before wore out quickly. though it was mostly due to the conditions here - alot of walking on rocks. Expect +/-6 months before you'll have to get another pair.
4,Had to return boots - no problem,I had to return these boots. The vendor was easy to work with. Got a prompt refund.
1,Inexpensive boots. Cheap boots,"These are more comfortable than my worn out boots. I used these on patrols about twice per week and they started showing wear on the sole after the first week. The boot laces were a little short for my preference. And it is funny to me that I serve the people of Iraq and the United States wearing boots made in China. These seem to be a good inexpensive boot. I am curious to see how they stand up to a little more use/abuse.The results are that these boots feel great... for a very short period of time. The sole wore out within two months. Just walking in gravel and dirt tore these things up in less than a month, the next month was rough on my feet. I had to break down and buy some quality boots."
1,useless,These are worthless. The layers of the sole started to separate after a 10 mile hike. The rubber started to wear through very quickly as well. I woulddnt give these to a 4 year old
4,More Circle of Friends,"If you got the first book(Best of Friends) in this Circle of Friends series, you are going to want to get this one, too. It continues with the same characters of Book #1. Life is not simple for teenagers. More complications, more relationship interaction."
4,The Old Ways,"This is the second in what I hope will be an ongoing series of English detective novels featuring DI Keith Tyrell, a quietly spoken man from the upper classes, educated at one of England's top Public (private) schools. In the area near the Forest of Dean, an ancient home of the pagan religion and of one of the oldest races in Britain, the bodies of several girls are found, apparently drowned in the rain swollen rivers of Wye and Severn. Tyrell and his off sider, Sgt. Clarke investigate the matter without getting too much help from the Foresters, as the local inhabitants are known. Tyrell is continually hampered in his investigations by the jealous rantings of his nemesis, DCI Whitaker, a man close to the edge of total breakdown. It's an intriguing story touched by Wicca, computer hacking and the conflicts between village personalities. I hope that there is to be a third book with these characters in it!"
5,More books like this please!,"This is a great book, good characterization and a solid plot. It was great to see Han back in the spotlight with Leia by his side, and Han and Leia actually acting like they were married for once. I think Han/Leia fans should all like this book. I know I have been waiting a long, long time for a book focusing on them to come out. Their relationship is done very well, and is the best part about this book for me.This book seemed much more ""small-scale"" like the X-Wing novels which is probably why I liked it so much - there is one main plot, and just a few main characters so you can really delve into the details. Boths plotlines of Leia searching for her parentage and the chase for the painting were done well.I hope Troy Denning comes back to write more on Han and Leia in the future."
2,Falls a bit short,"This is a good book overall (set between the Courtship of Princess Leia and the original Thrawn Trilogy), but as in the prequel movies, it seems like everything is a little 'too' convenient. Everybody that Han and Leia run into on Tatooine either grew up with or knew Anakin and Shmi somehow.Troy Denning is an excellent author (Star by Star and several Forgotten Realms titles) and he goes into a good bit of detail in this book which is a plus. So the entertainment factor is there, but unfortunately that's about it."
4,Return of the Classic era,"Now that the aweful NJO is coming to an end, it was a real joy to have Troy Denning, how ironic, do a story written for the long time fans of the SW Expanded Universe.This is Han and Leia and chewy on an adventure, never mind what the excuse is... something about an alderaanian item. Lets hope that more of this is planned."
5,A Wonderful Star Wars Novel,"Troy Denning's Tatooine Ghost is a joy to read! Yes, it is an Expanded Universe novel and if you haven't read any of the previous ""further adventures of..."" novels, newcomers will not get any of the references to other works (such as Dave Wolverton's ""Courtship of Princess Leia,"" Timothy Zahn's Grand Admiral Thrawn trilogy, or Dark Horse Comics' Dark Empire series, all of which are alluded to here. What makes this novel worth reading is the connection between the classic trilogy, expanded universe, and the current films. The Force is with Tatooine Ghost!"
2,Slow Pace,"I've read almost every Star Wars novel so I consider myself somewhat of an expert. Troy Denning is one of my favorite Star Wars novelist but I have to admit that this story was slow and boring. I suppose that is was the lack of Jedi duals and use of force powers--aside from a few visions experienced by Leah. It is worth reading because it does fill in some gaps but only by serious fans. I wouldn't recommend this novel to the casual reader as I'm afraid it would turn them away from reading more, better Star Wars novels."
4,Trippy book grat idea,This book takes events that happened in star wars episode 1 and throws them together with the characters from the original trilogy. All without Jake Loyd's inability to act or Jar Jar Binks. Essentially some of the interesting ideas brought fourth and characters barely introduced are brought to life in this book as Leia deals with the fact that her father was not always the evil man that she knew.
5,Good read! Love the books right after Return of the Jedi.,"Finally can enjoy Star Wars books again. Won't read anything the ""dates"" after Chewbacca's death. So I'm thrilled to have more books written with Chewbacca in it!"
3,entertaining but shallow,"In this book, we are promised a journey into the world of the newleywed Han and Leia. Dissapointing at best in that regard, with the dedicated interaction only comprised of minor wrangling with the should-we-or-shouldn't-we-have-children issue on Leia's part. The remainder of the book is spent chasing after a person and painting across the dunes of Tattooine and predictably arriving at that goal with a couple of minor twists. The best part of the book are Shmi's diary entries re Anakin and Leia's reaction to them, but the characters are poorly developed and we are porovided with only minimal descriptions of what makes them unique."
3,Han and Leia,This book is basically Leia coming to terms with her heritage. Luke makes a very small appearence. If you are a Han or Leia fan you would probably enjoy this book. Otherwise you could probably skip it. The only really new information for the reader is to find out how Anakin's mother won her freedom and got married.
2,A narrow variety of designs,"I have both Anne Orr's Classic Patterns and Tatting with Anne Orr, and I must say that this book is my least favorite of the two. With only 25 pages of actual designs, most of the patterns consist of luncheon sets, motifs and edgings. This book would be good if you're an advanced tatter who enjoys creative challenges such as combining motifs to make larger pieces, if you like the repetitiveness of luncheon sets, or if you're a beginning tatter who wants to make a ton of simple motifs."
2,Out of date patterns,I have purchased many tatting books in the past two years; this one is a disappointment because the patterns are difficult to read and the style of tatting very out of date.
1,Warning,Warning - this edition is just a scam to get you to buy some self-help memoir garbage that is printed inside the cover. Do not buy - download Fisher on-line if you are interested.
2,THE DEBT-DEFLATION THEORY OF GREAT DEPRESSIONS,"This book was recommended by friend, but I was disappointed with the conclusions of the author. The theory is useful only as a reference to an opinion."
3,A few ideas..,He points out some valid causes for the busts of the blast hundred and fifty years with remarkable accuracy. Amazing...but simplistic and dry. That's expected given the subject and the author stating it as basic ideas to be reviewed further in the future.
4,Good Tempos,"The plie music is hard to get used to, but worth it. Also, exercises are long, so you don't have to stop and wait for the music to begin again. Also, good tempos, gets you off the floor, music sounds like the exercise. A really good CD for ballet class. if you want to hear really beautiful inspiring music, get Josu Gallastegui Pas De Basque or others of his CD's. you have to go to his web site directly i think."
3,Average CD for Ballet Class,I was not impressed with this CD. I find it difficult to fit my combinations to the music. The plie music is terrible and I am not happy with the music for the center. The are much better ballet class CDs out there.
3,Disappointment for Legion fans,"A weak entry in the Legion of Space series, structured more as a whodunit than an epic space opera and lacking the thrills and chills of The Legion of Space and The Cometeers. Much of the story takes place in a casino. There are many strange coincidences, characters turning out to be long lost relatives or business associates from 50 years ago and the like. Disappointing.I read the Pyramid paperback edition with the Jack Gaughan cover."
5,A great album,"The Type O Negative Orgin cd is personaly my favorite Type O Negative cd. If you liked the Slow Deep and Hard cd and if you like the Bloody Kisses cd than you will most likely like this one. You can really see the transformation of the two very different styles they play on this cd. They have to old stuff such as ""I Know Your F_cking Someone Else"" and then they have there cover of Hey Joe only titled Hey Pete. I like this cd because it has my favorite old Type O Negative material plus it has the two really good cover songs. But you have to like the the songs such as Bloody Kisses(a death in the family) and Love you to Death to really get in to the cover songs on this album. It is a very good cd one of my favs in my collection. So if your a Type O fan or just someone who wants a to check them out this is a great cd to own."
3,Its just ok,Another album in mediocre. Its just for combilators. If you are new and you like really slow atmospheric/gothic metal then check Bloody kisses and October Rust which is their best album
2,Just Trains,"I bought this book for my 2 year-old son because he's a nut about trains and for myself because I also love trains. The book is good, but certainly not great. The illustrations are clear, but the pop-up design and flap placement are poor. You see half the trains when looking from front to back and the second half of the trains looking back to front. In other words, you have to flip the book upside down to see the other half of the trains. The flaps are flimsy and tear easily. Compared to other flap books, this one is not very robust. The flaps are also not very interesting. My son grew tired of the book very quickly as the text describing the trains is not very engaging for his age group. The text seems better suited to 3rd graders, but the pop-up flap nature seems geared for younger readers. Overall the book does not really reach either audience."
4,one helpful commercial outline,"I'm not a big commercial outline user--I only used them in two classes during law school--Civil Procedure (Examples and Explanations) and Federal Courts. My professor was an old U. Chi. grad, and had Currie for Federal Courts when he was in law school, so he liked this book and it tracked our class discussions pretty well. Currie's writing is clear, and TO THE POINT. That's one thing I liked best about this one. I would recommend it over Chemerinsky's Federal Jurisdiction, which I also looked at. Federal Jurisdiction has more detail (in terms of particular case discussion) but I didn't think it had much more substance (at least what law students need and can comprehend) than Currie's Nutshell. This is one I recommend."
1,Did not fit 4Runner,Says it fits the 3.4L 4Runner engine but is actually for the 2.7L Tacoma engine. Does not fit what Amazon said it would.
2,This did not fit my 4Runner,"I tried to put this filter in, but would not fit (which was supposed to fit my 4Runner).. So can't review as far as performance.. but give bad ratings for saying it would fit in my vehicle!"
4,kn filter,i purchased this to have a long term replacement for my 4cyl 4runner. works fine good flow and horsepower. the only thing that would make this better is if it was a lifetime filter without using oil. (AEM woud have been my first choice)
5,"completly ""alien"" sounding!!!!",This CD remians good in every point-of-view(lyrics songwriting ECT). When im unhappy this is a good on to listen to. Because you feel less alone in your misery. The music and lyrics go striaght to your soul.
5,like prayers for rain,ok computer stratling majestic tender rawlast summer i listened to it for nights and nights by the lake watching it rained and rained and welled inside of me a wall of surging water...singular glorious it made me choke
4,"Very good, but not their best!","really started to dig the band hearing ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Karma Police"" on the Radio. OK Computer is ranked as one of the best albums ever, i think that's slightly overrated - since I think they got even Better after this one. Still this one got me interested in the band, and for a short time i didn't think it could get any better, that is until i got used to Kid A and Amnesiac. But this album has got perhaps their best song ever, ""Exit music for a Film"". The song just gives me shivers... in a good way. ""Filter Happier"" is pretty pointless though. Oh and you gotta check out the singles they released in this period. Some of B-sides are better than anything here, like ""Polyetheline"" ""Pearly"" and ""How to be a millionaire""."
5,five stars is not enough,"this is truly one of the most dynamic, amazing, inspiring pieces of art of the twentieth century. full of emotion and energy, 'ok computer' is virtually flawless. every song is an integral part of the whole experience; even after countless listenings, i can never bring myself to skip a track. but at the same time, each song stands alone as an amazing piece of work.from the opening guitar riff of 'airbag' to the eerie interlude of 'fitter happier,' from 'climbing up the walls'' obsessive nature to the detached lyrics of 'the tourist,' this album is a trip i never tire of taking.'ok computer' will no doubt stand the test of time as one of the most influential and important events in modern music."
5,Comparable to the Floyd,"I first heard this c.d. about a month ago when my history teacher played it for our class. The first thing I thought was, ""oh my god; this sounds like Pink Floyd.""Well, I can't say I agree with all the people who say that this is the best record of ALL TIME, but I see where this praise is coming from. I'd definitely say it's the best album of the nineties; I usually hate modern music but this album is hope that it doesn't have to be ALL bad.And the fact that I compare Radiohead to the Floyd and OK Computer to Dark Side of the Moon and even The Wall is the highest praise imaginable on my part, considering the fact that I worship the Floyd almost religiously. This album has the feel, the sound, the lyrics, and the whole concept-album thing that was perfected if not pioneered by Pink Floyd. So therefore, if you like this kind of music, if you like to think about what you listen to, if you're even a wee bit open-minded, then buy this album, and you won't regret it."
1,WHERES THA HIP HOP,"i brought this albumn mistaking it for local hip hop group of the same name. a ... i was not taken by the noise and poor vocal skills, they need some lessons on how to play and write reeal music. BEP to the end"
1,I'd rather listen to Avril,"If Perry Como made rock n roll, it would sound like this. Good stuff to listen to if your suffering from insomnia and need a nap real bad.Sluggish, dull - like staring at drywall for an hour."
1,DOWN WITH COMPUTER MUSIC!,"This band is so lame. They are trying way too hard to emulate Coldplay's sound. I don't get the lead singer, all he does is whine and moan. And this isn't even music, it's just sound effects. Coldplay and Starsailor paved the way for this band, but that doesn't mean it is any good."
1,Are you serious!,"Probably the most overrated recordings of all time. Having lovedPablo Honey (4 stars) and The Bends (5 stars), and after readingall the '5-star' reviews of this CD, I figured 'Hey...I gotta getthis CD'! Well, I'm trading it in tomorrow. As another reviewerstated, it's very 'tedious'. Second-rate Pink Floyd. This stuffwas being done in the seventies! Anyone remember Tangerine Dream?This CD is better than maybe only two or three of all of PinkFloyds recordings. The only decent song on the CD is Karma Police. What was Radiohead thinking after making a great CD like The Bends, and then following up with this? Why all the glowingreviews? All I can think of is the standard/bar for a great CD has been lowered tremendously. How else can you explain the popularity of rap, hip-hop, Eminem, Creed, and yes...even Nirvana?I highly recommend Pablo Honey and The Bends. I don't recommendOK Computer. If you want this type of music, buy any one ofabout eight Pink Floyd CDs."
1,OMG how can ppl think this is good!!!?!1,"the singer is really ugly and this band is just sooooo bad!! go buy an avril lavigne cd, shes like the biggest thing rite now, and sooo talented and pretty!!!"
3,3 and a half- good stuff,"great songs are all over this album. in fact, every song is great in its own way. it has standard rock filtered through electronic beats and colorful, textured vocals. these guys really are talented. Also there are acoustic songs and ballads.so why not give it 4 or 5 stars? well, i guess i shouldn't judge it like this, but considering all the praise, hype, and other albums radiohead has done, this one slipped under my expectations. That's not to say it ain't good cause it is. it's as good as people say it is, i'm just biased. I like it. blah blah blah. **plus you know 5 stars gets overused- one reason an album should get 5 stars is when it stands the test of time, doesn't get dated. Not cause it just came out and it's caTCHY (which i'm not saying this is)**"
5,Check this out...,"Go to the review of ""How to disappear completly and never be found"" in the books section and look who left a review in April 1998. Weird huh!OK Computer is the greatest album of the 90's. Nothing else really comes close. It's a shame they changed so much direction for Kid A I believe. If youre new to Radiohead, start right here."
5,The first step for a continuous change,"It's for me the emblematic disc of Radiohead, since it's the begining of a series of musical changes that would come in later discs. This it's the disc with which I realized that Radiohead was an excellent group, ready to evolve and to grow. Only listen it, and I believe that you will be agree with me, is really a great group and this a great disc!!"
5,Essential Psychedelic Rock,"After listening to The Bends feverishly for several years, I was confronted with OK Computer. I loved The Bends too much. It can never be surpassed, I said. A friend said, ""Buy OK Computer or I'll buy it for you..."" I avoided the record like the plague for a couple more years. One day I broke down. An album graced my ears. One of unbelievable polish. Unbelievable musicianship. Unreal creativity. I was moved, I was stirred and I was shaken. This is likely the most important record they had made up to this point. A must-have."
3,Made me weep with joy at its artistic powerful perfection,Is it too obvious to mention Douglas Adams's Hitchikers Guide To The Galaxy book and tv series and its influence on this album? Probably to older British fans. Its just that one of the main characters of this comedy book/radio/tv series was a super intelligent moaning depressed robot called Marvin the Paranoid Android.And theres the album name.The most common phrase mentioned in the book is ok computer.And that Lucky song dont half sound like a Pink Floyd cover version of the theme tune to the BBCs early 80s tv version of the book.And er yeah this album is ok from what ive heard of it.
5,What is wrong with the debators?,"yeah I saw this album getting a somewhat lesser review (4.5 stars) due to people who just don't get. it's very sad to see this. oh well, if you came here to decide whether or not to buy this album-- then for God's sake, man, buy it! It is a classic and THE best Radiohead album. What other album sparks this much controversy (besides maybe Sgt. Pepper)"
5,One of the best albums of the nineties. Period!,"Original, beautiful and haunting album.Brilliant music is still being composed; Yorke's band has a sound and a status of its own.Highly recommended!"
5,"Groundbreaking, Intelligent Music","No matter how many times I listen to OK Computer, I just cannot get over how incredible it really is. Way ahead of its time, the mixture of heavy guitars, light electronica and mellow vocals is a real delight to the senses. ""No Surprises"" ranks as my favorite track along with ""Paranoid Android."" Might I also recommend the companion DVD, ""7 Television Commercials,"" which is pretty much a collection of all the videos."
5,The BEST album in music HISTORY!!!,"This third opus from Radiohead is by far the best album in history. Better than the Beatles, Elvis, etc. The various paths of music that the band takes you on each track is infinite. Infinite because everytime you listen to it, it is fresh, new, unique. Yes, even though you just listened to it an hour ago. Radiohead is the only artist this applies to (for me, anyway).It saddens me on negative reviews - but every one is entitled to an opinion. There are people out there who think Slim Whitman or the silky sounds of Tiny Tim are better than sliced bread. One man's trash is another's treasure. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - or whatever. What it comes down to, though - there are those who turn on the light in a dark room and those who choose to remain in darkness. I'm glad I turned on the light."
5,One of the best,"I'll keep this short and sweet, as most everyone reviewing this album has already sung every wonderful, brilliant praise that could be mentioned about it. OK Computer remained my favorite album for around two or three years, unmatched by anything, and now it rests only below Jeff Buckley whom I discovered at the beginning of college in 2001. This album is an anthem of beauty, melody, and innovation. Every song is wonderful (with the personal exception of Fitter Happier which has always creeped me out)--definitely something to include in every musical collection of those who truly like escapism and melodically lush and moving soundscapes."
5,"Radiohead's Answer To ""The Wall""","Radiohead has proven to be a band in a constantly evolving state. Never becoming stale, they have a talent for pushing the music to the limit. It seems that now, in retrospective, that the most unique way to look at this album is as another process in the evolution of this always-moving band.Radiohead may not deliver any smash hits like ""Creep"" on this album, but making hits never was Radiohead's game. Tracks like ""Airbag"" soar over beautifully laced guitar work, while melancholy songs like ""Karma Police"" have an almost anti-pop appeal, blending sound pop melodies with dissonant strains barely escaping from Thom Yorke's lips. In many ways, Radiohead sort of reminds you of all those appreciated-but-underappreciated artists like ""Pink Floyd,"" ""Tool"" and ""Nine Inch Nails."" Radiohead's music is not usually dark sounding, but they deliver more of a punch than most metal bands today."
5,utterly incredible,"When my friend first started raving about this album, I only remembered the Radiohead who did ""Creep"", a song which didn't stand out in my mind at all. Finally, out of curiosity, I bought this album. From the first notes of ""Airbag"" to the last notes of ""The Tourist"", I was entirely blown away. Every single note is crafted with care and feeling, every single word speaks in volumes. If you want a massive head rush, listen to this on headphones. The music attacks from every direction at once. Your head will follow the long fluid guitar leads and your ears will echo the drum and bass. This album is the finest thing I have heard in years. I originally got it on tape, and within four months, I had worn it out."
4,Very Good,"It took me several listens to get into, but I agree that OK Computer deserves all of the critical praise being heaped upon it. Though I don't fully see the ""concept"" link of this album, the songs provide a perfect backdrop for the Year 2000 scare. Many songs evoke a cold, cruel world where progress has enslaved the human spirit. The Orwellian ""Fitter Happier"" could well be the most chilling cut on the disc. However, there are moments where humanity shines through, as on the bridge to the authoritarian ""Karma Police"" (Whew!/For a minute there/I lost myself). You'll lose yourself, too, on this compelling album."
2,Why aren't these titles remastered?,"I cannot believe that the 3 Radiohead ""Collector's Edition"" titles are NOT remastered. CD remastering technology has come a long way since these CDs were initially released. OK Computer is twelve years old! It would have been nice to hear these titles with improved sound quality, but instead EMI (assumably with the band's consent) have just repackaged the same CDs with the various B-sides.To be fair, the price is good versus having to buy all the EPs and singles to get these tracks. But these days, when classic albums are reissued, it is expected that they are remastered (The Cure, Depeche Mode, New Order, Pearl Jam, etc.)These non-remastered titles just make Radiohead look as out of touch as The Beatles."
5,I love radiohead!,"I read about how it takes a few listen to's to get into it but I got into it as soon as i popped the cd into my stereo.I just bought the new cd ""Hail to the Thief"" and it does take me a while to get into it and my girlfriend hates it.I told her to not focus on Thom's voice just listen how it goes with the music.Oh well...........bottom line is this cd goes up there with the greatest of all time!Period!"
3,"ok, someone please explain what all the fuss is about","i really had high hopes for this album. airbag is a fantastic song, so are homesick alien and paranoid android. from there, it just goes downhill, with the exception of karma police. fitter happier is a well concieved but poorly executed idea of pre-fight club ideas. might be worth it to you, but i don't know."
2,Hideously overrated / Bono rip-off sings in poor compositons,"The singer spends most of the album imitating Unforgettable Fire-era Bono, slurs his words in an effect that can only be called pretentious (or lacking in anything to say). The band really is quite good. But overall, the melodicism is soupy, the effect unfocused. The standout here is ""Karma Police."" But all in all, a hideously overrated album. As with Averil Lavigne, I'm sure kids think this is terrific. They'll know better in a few years."
1,YUCK,Who listens to this tripe anyway? RADIOHEAD is what you get if you castrated Maynard James Keenan. This album should be packaged with No-DoZ pills.
1,OK---This is the dullest and most boring album___Ever,This album has to be the best album of the past 20 years for insomniacs
1,Yawn,"This was a blind buy for me based on all the hype of this cd. I have listened to it about a dozen times from start to finish. It's not like I don't like mellow music, but this cd is painful to listen to. I guess I'll never be *cool* like you guys."
5,True musical genius...,"Radiohead does it again! Radiohead is truly the best band on the planet and proves it with this album. It is one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life. The sheer musical genius of ""Ok Computer"" is unsurpassed. If you love other compilations by Radiohead, you will love this one as well. However, if you love Radiohead as much as I do, you will have already bought all their albums!!!"
5,Masterpiece,"One of the best albums of the last 20 years, and amongst the canon of last century's greatest albums. It's clearly not for everyone, (even though it should be!), but this album for me is incredibly moving, clever, haunting, beautiful, emotional, angry and powerful. It deserves a decent intelligent listen."
5,Amazing,"I bought this album over a year or two ago. I had read the all the positive reviews, figured that I'd give the album a chance, and went out and bought it. When I started playing it I was a little bit disappointed. It wasn't bad but, other than Paranoid Android (which I thought was brilliant) and Subterranean Homesick Alien, none of it really sparked in me any interest. I put it aside, got into hip hop in a big way and didn't really listen to it for a year or so.As you've probably figured out I recently picked the album up and listened to it from start to finish during a long road trip. I couldn't believe that I'd ignored this album for so long. It's simply a brilliant album from start to finish. It's an acquired taste and definitely won't be for everyone but its genius can not be denied. I wouldn't call this a Rock album; it's probably the best example of an alternative album you'll ever find."
5,OK Computer catapults Radiohed into the elite,"So I cheated. I bought OK Computer before I bought Pablo Honey and The Bends. No matter. I was enraptured by the CD - it's haunting, tragic message intertwined with rage (""Climbing the Walls,"" ""Electioneering""). If this album isn't in the collection of every serious music listener, then I'm sure it was an oversight on the part of the purchaser."
5,"""lucky"" to have found such a gem",related to every word.... never had anything like that before... this cheeky brits have formed themselves a masterpiece... and a fan that is eager for a new recording.
5,"Best album since ""(What's the Story?) Morning Glory""","OK Computer is without question, Radiohead's best album to date. It is near perfect, with every song flowing together to create a giant wave of sound. This is one of few albums that be be listened to from the beginning to end with no skipping through to find favorites, because all of the songs are good, but most are great. These best tracks include ""Paranoid Android"", ""Let Down"", ""Karma Police"", and ""Climbing Up the Walls"". These four alone would be enough to call it a good album. I compare it Oasis'1995 release ""(What's the Story?)Morning Glory"" because they are similiar in that every song on the record is great and unforgetable."
5,Unparalleled,"If i had to choose a single album to have on a desert island, it might be The Bends.If i had to choose a single album to bury in a time capsule or shoot into space to represent the human race- it would unquestionably be OK Computer."
1,Might appeal to fans of space 1999,"horrible trash...whiny, whiny, bohooo, bohoooJust shut up and sing. Radiohead are the worst band ever..this album is the ultimate proof why."
1,Way Overrated.,"I bought this CD because everyone told me. This was the biggest waste of my money ever. Try as I might, I couldn't even make it past track three. After some futile skipping, I resigned myself to being a sucker to ""popular opinion."""
1,overrated soft rock......boring,"Despite the fact that all of my friends love this album and rate it as a breakthrough in rock history I must state my honest opinion. Radiohead has always been and always will be boring. If you are a true rock fan I recommend the Hives, the White Stripes and the Black Keys, and Electric Six. This album is something to go to sleep to and maybe if I was more of a dud and disliked alternative music I would enjoy it. I'll say one good thing about Radiohead; Creep was a good song."
1,poser music,"Anyone who thinks that this album is in any way innovative, experimental or avant-garde needs to stop trying to impress people with how cool they are and instead listen to anything by Fantomas, Mr Bungle, Thinking Plague, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, or Spiral Architect. THAT is progressive, innovative, groundbreaking music. This is just easy listening pop that ignorant posers think is avant-garde just because it doesn't sound like Britney Spears. Well, people, expand your horizons a little and move outside the mainstream. This album is about as innovative as Muzak."
1,radiohead crawled into my mind; now a microchip lurks there,"Anybody who eats food should not listen to this album because it will make you choke. Stay away from this material. It is hazardous to our health. Don't eat the soylent green. Meeting people is really really hard. Go ask alice; she swallowed bill gates ( who is, by the way, the most parrrrrannnnnoid man in the galaxy). Read ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed"" by Paolo Freire. Then read it again. Don't be frightened. We hope that you will find this record just as delightful as the grammy committee (who are those people anyway?).Voice One: you shouldn't ramble--people will stop listening to you eventually. Just get to the point, OKAY?!?!Voice Two: Okay......daddy hurts me."
1,If you want interesting music try Tool or Alice In Chains,No this album isnt 1 star. Yes practically every radiohead fan in the world has rated this album 5 star. No i dont like this style of music. Yes my two favorite bands are Alice In Chains and Tool. Yes Tool is also overrated. Yes they deserve to be. No radiohead does NOT deserve to be. Yes Radiohead are a pretentious band. No Tool are not a pretentious band. Therefore TOOL and ALICE IN CHAINS are better than Radiohead.
1,Music for wankers,"This is the worst album ever. Buy some Bob Dylan, Bruce springsteen...please and AVOID this trash"
2,Radiohead's so called masterpiece,"This music just meanders all over the place, I want something that will suprise me but this is all the same slow boring stuff. Filter Happier is the best track and makes up two stars, please don't buy this."
2,Boring non-innovative rock,"Perhaps if this had come out well before ""in the court of the crimson king"" or ""dark side of the moon"" this would be some kind of innovative work. Instead, it is just a very derivitive mope-fest with little charm. There are a couple standout tracks, but those are quickly bogged down by Floyd-lite numbers with no punch.Radiohead does a nice job of mixing their influences, but goes a little overboard in directly lifting passages from Pink Floyd's Live Ummagumma disc.The record now sounds tinny and dated. It was nice to see Radiohead learn from this and produce the organic Kid A, which is easily their best work and well worth owning. This one is utterly forgettable."
5,One of the greats!,"I place this album on a pedestal with Sgt. Pepper's and Dark Side of the Moon. Never have I been so transfixed by a CD. It gives me great hope in the future of music. (I was a little bit worried for a while that music was dead.) Though it requires numerous hearings to do it justice, I found it instantly inspirational. It is good to know that someone in the music world understands modern life. No more of all this ridiculous bubble gum music that trivializes our existence. Life is difficult and often futile, and it's time we acknowledged it. END"
5,The -->BEST<-- album EVER!!!!!,"the most brilliant album yet!...even better than ""the bends""(there second album)OK computer is a masterwork woven by guitars,drums and the stunningly great voice of Thom Yorke. the only thing better then it is hearing it live..it blows my mind away. END"
2,"The epitome of the ""mediocrity rises to the top"" theory.","Allow me to be the voice of dissention/reason here. Perhaps my expectations were too high after all the hype about this album, but this is some of the most bland, reconstituted swill I've ever heard. This sounds like watered-down Beatles and Pink Floyd with some U2 thrown in. I don't mind music that is somewhat derivative, but this music is just nauseatingly formulaic. This album is one of the most glaring musical examples of the mind-boggling 70's retro movement. It's strictly for those who are still pining away for a ""lost"" Beatles album, or can't get over the old ""British invasion"" days. I guess it's okay if you want to like this album, but its idle to pretend its some sort of instant classic, or stroke of genius. Blahhh."
2,hmm,"Radiohead, despite all the critical adoration, is Pink Floyd without pop sensibility. I know most of the readers of this review will disagree, but good music generally has some sort of memorable quality to it, whether its a catchy hook or stand out lyrics. I appreciate the effort but after multible sittings with this album, I can't think of any particular moment that stands out. In fact, sometimes it comes off as being pretentious. But hey, thats just my opinion..."
5,What can I say?,"Read any and all positive reviews here and you may very well get an idea of what kind of effect this album has had on an entire generation. The very first time I listened to this album I stopped everything I was doing and just sat down and listened. I was immediately enthralled, and subsequent spins have revealed loads of emotions and superb songwriting. Why this album does not have a solid, collective 5-star-rating is absolutely baffling to me. I could note specific songs that I like more personally, but seriously, this whole album is outstanding."
2,Uuuuuuuuuuugh,"Thom Yorke's incessant whining and moaning prevent me from enjoying this album. I like the slick production and neat guitar tricks, but the singer just doesn't know when to shut up and let the music speak. I enjoyed the first couple of Radiohead CDs, but I do believe Mr. Yorke has fallen victim to the same syndrome that ruined Bono and that big-lipped what's-his-name guy from The Verve. Yorke is obviously in love with his voice and so we must all suffer the non-stop groaning. Too bad, because there's some half-decent music on here. Maybe I just don't feel sorry enough for myself to get into this. Get The ""Pop is Dead"" single if you prefer your rock with some backbone. Or, you could just get The Pixies."
5,"Brilliant, Simply Brilliant","Radiohead started out as your average British Alternative band. Then came ""OK Computer""; no one had heard anything like it before, and no one ever will. With this album, they carved their own niche in the world of music and inspired a ton of bands in the process. There's nothing on earth like the combination of Thom Yorke's voice and Jonny Greenwood's innovative style of guitar playing. ""Paranoid Android"" is well worth the price of the CD."
5,One of my favourite albums EVER,"this is the only radiohead cd i own (for now) but after listening to this i want to get all of their cds this cd is sooo great ALL of the songs are awesome (even Fitter Happier, which isnt really a song)My favourite songs:1.Airbag - great opener with the cello, and i love the chorus2.Paranoid Android - a real radiohead ANTHEM almost a mix of several different songs4.Exit Music (For A Film) - i LOVE THIS SONG possibly my favourite on the album with the best ending6.Karma Police - everyone knows and loves this song with great reason, its just soo good9.No Surprises - cool guitar playing and nice bridge for the song11.Lucky - awesome song but i dont know why it wasnt realised as a single its pretty damn good"
5,My favourite album of the 90s,"The first couple times I listened to this CD I wasn't as taken with it as I had been with theeir previous album The Bends. It grew on me very quickly though and has since become my favourite album of the 90s. At one point the band considered releasing videos for each song on the album (a plan that ended when they were unhappy with the never released Let Down video) and the idea isn't as crazy as it sounds. With the exception of the spoken word track ""Fitter Happier"" all of the tracks on the album really are top notch. My personal favourites are Karma Police, Paranoid Android, Climbing up the Walls and Lucky. This album is definitely a grower."
5,Roll over beethoven...,"Incedible. What else can I say? This album will certainly (or at least should) go down in history as the second greatest of all time (second to the Beatles' White Album). I am fickle and usually stop listening to a CD, even a good one, after a few weeks. But this--I might as well have it surgically implanted in my brain. It never gets old. In fact, it gets better every time."
5,my favourite album in the last 5 years,"How can i describe this epic recording? In one word, brilliant. There is not one bad song on the entire album. Even the haunting fitter happier has merit as a legitmate piece of music. Stand out tracks include Exit Music (for a film) (which could quite possibly be one of the best songs in the last 10 years), No Surprises, Paranoid Android and Lucky. I have heard the b-sides of this album and they are equally brilliant. This just proves that Radiohead can not write a bad song. Go buy this album, NOW!!!"
5,This album restored my faith in rock music.,"This album will restore your faith in music. It shows that there is an alternative to the strained screaming voices of recent alternative bands which all sound alike. There has never been a better album, British or American. Songs like ""No Suprises"", ""Letdown"", and ""Exit Music.."" are so emotional, mind-blowing, and evoking that you are completely caught up in the music and transfered into Radiohead's world. It's an amazing thing to hear. The Bends is a very hard album to top, but this does it without question. Radiohead is by far the best band of the 90s. The blending of the instruments, and the Thom's controlled voice are so intense, that I almost can't listen to it sometimes. My advice: BUY THE CD NOW!! YOU WILL NEVER FEEL THE SAME ABOUT MUSIC!"
5,Possibly one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.,"I dismissed Radiohead in 1993 as another whiney band. I'm not a cure fan at all, and I felt they were somewhat like them. I listened to The BENDS in 1995, and still couldn't get into them (the whole post-metal phase had me seeking Soundgarden to soften up to). But, in 1998, I had Karma Police in my head and went nuts trying to find the album, which I did 2 weeks later at, of all places, a Walmart. This album is pure genius. It is different than THE BENDS, but is still an amazing album. I particluarly like Airbag, No Surprises, Karma Police and Paranoid Android, not because most were videos, but because they are such intricate songs. This album helped me to write my latest movie."
3,Vinyl Quality Control,"I don't understand the quality control in vinyl these days. They cost way above what they need to and don't deliver according to the high cost. To be fair, the sound, production, and mixing are all amazing. Very low surface noise, very dynamic sound... this album has never sounded more amazing! The issue is that side B and side D both are printed off center enough to create horrible pitch shifting even on the outer tracks! This of course renders the music on these sides completely unenjoyable. 5 stars for the music, 2 for the vinyl. It's easily a 5 stars for the vinyl if you get one printed correctly."
5,Radiohead has achieved sonic perfection,"This album is perfect in every way. The way each song leads into the next is breathtaking. The first track is very misleading, as the opening ""Airbag"" seamlessly melds into ""Paranoid Android"", the listener is thrown for a loop. The songs range from the soothing ""No Surprises"", to the jangly ""Electioneering"", to the hypnotic ""Fitter, Happier."" The album must be listened to as a whole for it's effects to really become noticeable, but it one of the most rewarding listening experiences in recent years/decades."
4,"melodic and mature, its one of their best","more mature than pablo, more melodic than the bends, this album is awesome. the songs flow one after another as one experimental masterpiece, as though this album was entirely for the guys enjoyment, not the mainstream listener. absolutely perfect for a quiet night in, it is easy to lose oneself in the album. not a great car record and no real hits to be found, but the album is excellent nonetheless. an amazing groove from one of the best groups out there."
5,A Spectacular Piece of Work,"This third studio album continues the progression of the band into more subtle, ambient, electronic experimentation. The mood of the cd moves from low grade paranoia to euphoria to utter indifference. It's definitely something that needs to be experienced, and can't be accurately described. It needs to be listened to in entirety at least 7 times before one can get a handle on the music."
5,"man, slow down","i don't know why it took me so long to buy this album but i finally did and i am at a loss for words. i haven't felt this way about an album since pink floyd's animals. you will not be disappointed with this believe me. standouts include the tourist, electioneering, karma police, and of course paranoid android."
5,"Ethereal and subversive, emotive and human.","My first taste of Radiohead - Pink Floyd meets This Life. Paradoid Android must be one of the seminal songs of the 90s. I read an interview with Tom York where he talked of Paranoid Android being a distillation of the entire album which, was not an attempt to write a ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" but a collage of movement. The melding of those pieces is mind-blowing.The final track on the album, The Tourist, is heart-racingly powerful, leaving you with a sense of place; a sense of humanity which is totally subversive when unleashed.I now wonder whether Radiohead can ever transcend OK Computer, not that I doubt their ability, but every great band has a creative pinnacle which they may never reach again. I just wonder if Radiohead have hit that peak with OK Computer."
5,Belief in music again,"Thank goodness for the library. I saw this Cd in the library and checked it out. I instantly loved it. This CD gets better and better with each listen. The incredibly deep and evocative music is combined with lyrics that are some of the best I've ever heard in ""rock"". Do not dismiss this album as ""weird"". It takes more than one listen to enjoy the hidden samples and instruments and understand the depth of the songs themselves. I am anxiously awaiting Radiohead's next album after hearing this."
5,THRILLING!!!,"Their best album in my opinion, even better than ""The Bends"" which was already something! It gives you the chills all the way through... And if it doesn't, I'm telling you, there's something wrong with you!"
2,Gotta match your taste!,"The album has a few (not many according to me) excellent tracks. But i think I was kinda disappointed probably after all the positive feedback this album received. As said by several reviewers the album has to speak to you. If this is not the case, you probably will not enjoy most of the tracks. This is pretty much my case. But this is only a matter of opinion.My recommendation is to try to listen to the album before purchasing it coz you could either love it or hate it.Still the track ""No Surprises"" is super famous and really really good."
3,A word of caution,"For those musically adventurous types out there who have heard the hoopla about these talented guys and want to see if the rest of their stuff is kinda like the radio-friendly and infectious ""Creep"" then beware. It's not. I can see where they would appeal to certain folks, I'm just not one of them and that's okay. Different strokes, ya know. I'm one who likes a good strong drummer and powerful vocals on the songs I choose to listen to and I didn't find that here. I will say one thing for them. They are definitely unique and a change of pace. Just be aware of what you are getting into with OK Computer."
5,Technophobia,"Arguably the best album of the 90s. Easily one of the greatest of all time. Radiohead wrote a concept album that truly conveyed their concept, of technological paranoia, the loss of identity in a world controlled by computers and monitored at all times. And every song works perfectly. The album is a true testament to musicianship, and should be owned by every true music lover. Stand out songs include ""Exit Music (For a Film)"", ""Let Down,"" and ""The Tourist."""
5,Just Simply a Good Album,I love Radiohead. They are one of my favourite bands. I just love them and everything they put out is great. They are inspiring musicians and this album is evidence.
4,All the rave reviewers would do well to check out HUM,"Hum, the band that perfected washes of abstract sounds mixed with a wall of heavy guitars .. on an album, downward is heavenward, that came out near the same time as OK Computer."
5,Upgrade of possibly the best album ever,Even though it is annoying how the record companies keep making us re-buy stuff we already have the bonus material on all 3 of the new Radiohead reissues makes it well worth the purchase.
5,Fantastic!,"The item shipped within the esimated time. It was fully sealed when it arrived and plays like a dream with no scratches or skips.Also, this album rocks."
5,Still one of my favorites...,Six years later and I still listen to several tracks regularly. Paranoid Android and No Surprises especially.Good album with some great songs. One of five to bring with you if stranded somewhere. :)
1,ok,"it may be good compared to other radiohead cds, but there is much better stuff you could be listining to. this isn't music."
1,radio-turd,radiohead the most over-rated depressing..self indulgent..idiotic whiney music ever this music is made for nerds or people who want to slit their wrists..it's so mind numbingly dumb yeah i know i must be missing something and something is wrong with my brain and i have bad taste in music boo hoo..well i don't have bad taste i just maybe have a brain which functions not on anti-depression drugs...ok computer please turn off..
3,A lieth to drinketh is a surefire path to the bowels of hell,"In the Bible it doth say that if you make a false witness or something you are going to hell. Well like everyone who reviewed this album is going to hell. You all say that this is the best album of the 90s or the best album of all time, but you HAVEN'T HEARD every album released in the 90s, let alone throughout all the annals of time. I mean, Mozart probably released some super-bit*hing album in the 1600s or whenever that cat was writing that ""Roll Over Beethoven"" song. Oh yeah, and this album has some good songs and some filler. It's okay. Listen to Samael. Or Peccatum. Or Ulver. Or Creed..."
2,Huh?,"I guess I don't get it. This music is very boring and drab. People think that this band is genius, but I think that it is a bunch of whiny garbage. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because everyone in the world seems to love this band. Oh and I seem to see a few people (Amazon editor included)comparing Radiohead to Pink Floyd??? This is Blasphemy! Roger Waters has more talent and creativity in his stool sample than Thom York could ever even dream. I hate to say it but their only good song was ""Creep""."
1,"Sour, discordant and mostly boring","I was lent the entire Radiohead discography. I hardly kept about 10 songs which are indeed quite good : ""Sail to the moon"", ""Nice dream"", ""Creep""... but the rest is a proper disaster. I was appalled by the live stuff : the guy just cannot sing properly unless he is backed by studio effects. He just has no voice, just a dismal creaking off-key whine that just make ears cringe. But apparently not everyone has ears. No to mention very poor melodies for most songs.The fact this band is so popular is not very encouraging. Creaking off-key whine lovers..."
2,OVERATED,"I am a Radiohead fan and this album is overated. KID A is by far the best Radiohead album. In fact, the bands 3 best songs may just be on that album (EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE, HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY, and MORNING BELL).MY RANKINGS:1. KID A (the peak of Radiohead)2. PABLO HONEY (does not get enough critical acclaim)3. THE BENDS (average follow-up to PABLO HONEY)4. OK COMPUTER (way overated)5. AMNESIAC (I wished for KID A part 2 and got this?)6. HAIL TO THE THIEF (beyond SIT DOWN, STAND UP this album weak)Thank you"
5,Much better than OK,"Radiohead takes ""Dark Side of the Moon"", plugs it into a Mac, rolls a big fat digital doobie and blows the binary smoke in your ear. That's ""OK Computer"" in a nutshell. Simply brilliant."
5,Genius!,"Well, After the breathtaking album THE BENDS they released this album two years later along with some commercial back up. The album became a huge sucess for radio head among with fans and critics. Namend one of the best albums of all time and best album s of the 90's and the best album of 1997. This album is probably and will be indeed rememberd for the songs on it. This album containes one of the best music you will ever find. It is different from The Bends but has a great musical force on it.All songs here are great and the album gets better and better with each song. Buy it."
5,"Radiohead, never sezies to amaze me.","What can i say about this UK band, but OUTSTANDING. OK Computer, takes there talent to newer grounds.I'll begin with the sounds, here Radiohead has construted pure magic, combinding Electronic sounds with an Orchestra-like feeling. Take Karma Police(my personal Favourite) i think it's the panio thats is driven with such pureity, lead singer Thom Yorke, has that Hauting yet Innocent voice that has driven this band to success and in this song you can see why this band is ahead of its time... If your not familiar with the sounds of Radiohead begin with Ok Computer.This album has a Construction of many feelings and passions that have many bands failed to deliver constantly in the 90's..."
5,wow.,"Being a Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and other prog rock fan, as well as modern alt rock, Radiohead was a natural progression for me, and OK Computer is where I started.All I can say is wow. While no track in particular, besides the awesome guitars of ""Electioneering"" stands out for me, the album as a whole is a brilliant polished piece of work. 5 stars."
5,subtly brilliant,"Unfortunately this album doesn't belong to that 97's music era, it was completely ahead of that time. Out of time. That is why it`s still being understood and that's also why it is rated 5 star."
5,"Very, very good music","This is one of the finest albums ever created. If you choose to disagree, you are simply wrong. Reconsider sharing any further opinions regarding any form of music. You have lost all credibility."
5,Adventure,"Radiohead is out defining theories of space and science out in the far galaxies, while today's Pop stars are grounded reinventing new claims on sliced bread. Radiohead is the saviour of Progressive music. Ok computer is one of the greates ""alternative"" albums of all time. The album as a whole moves in a musical journey that can be altering. A must have for any collection"
5,Simply the best,"For those who are still doubting wether to buy it or not just click on add to shopping basket. I can make sure it will be the best record you could ever listen to. It is a masterpiece!Every single song will move something inside of you. The way Thom Yorke sings will blow you away. Still doubting? Well, from now on youll be responsible for missing the best album ever or listening to it 10,000 times a day. You wont regret. The best one ever."
5,"OK Computer's not just OK, It's A Masterpiece","One of my favorite albums ever, although I have to say that The Bends, Kid A, Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief are all just as good. There really isn't much else for me to say that hasn't already been said about this album; it kind of surprises me that a lot of people actually ""get"" this album, it makes me happy to see all the other positive reviews on here.Airbag - 10/10Paranoid Android - 9/10Subterranean Homesick Alien - 8/10Exit Music (For A Film) - 9/10Let Down - 9/10Karma Police - 9/10Fitter Happier - 7/10Electioneering - 9/10Climbing Up The Walls - 9/10No Surprises - 8/10Lucky - 8/10The Tourist - 8/10"
5,OK Computer. OK Radiohead.,"Radiohead is one of the greatest bands in rock history. Today, they are simply the best ones."
2,"Moaning, Miserbale music.","Wow what a great album.Actually its fantastic musically, but for the rest of it, what a horrible moaning noise.You'll be so bored you'll wanna shoot yourself in the foot mid way through.Oh and ""Fitter Happier"" is rubbish."
2,This album is not that good....,"Please....someone explain this to me. I have listen to this album a dozen times and there is nothing memorable about it! The only reason I will give this 2 stars instead of 1 is that this album is better than most of the crap the music industry puts out there and then desperately markets. But to compare this to Pink Floyd? Come on, there is not a single PF album that ""takes five listens to"" in order to appreciate. I am sorry, but give me ""Animals"", ""Meddle"" or ""The Wall"" any day over this album."
1,This album is lame...,"Where's the rocking solos? I just see a bunch of whiney losers listening to this album in their bedrooms, alone on a friday night. Well quit crying because nobody cares. Maybe if you listened to some music that ROCKS like Motely Crue then you might have some friends but in the meantime keep crying!"
2,overrated,"I usually like this genre of music, but there is just so much better stuff out there. A few of the songs on here, like ""Karma Police"", ""No Surprises"" and ""Exit Music for a Film"" are OK, but I find Thom Yorke's singing voice to be really irritating. The lyrics are for the most part flat and obscure, and I don't find any ""deeper meaning"" behind them. The actual instrumental parts of the songs aren't bad, and I do like the experimentation with different sounds, but it often fails epically, like in ""Fitter, Happier""."
1,Hyped Trash!,How people can compare this piece of garbage to any pre-1987 Pink Floyd is something I will never understand.
2,Explain why.,"Not a big brit music fan but was compelled to listen because of the buzz. Explain to me why this is so great. If there's a theme here i don't get it. Some decent guitar playing but that doesn't really make it a ""Classic"". I guess standards of excellence have to be lowered due to the lack of any real intelligence or passion in modern rock music. Buy a Shellac album instead."
3,It's pretty cool,"When I bought radiohead's ok computer, it offered everything it promised, which is rare from an album. It's futuristic sound and interesting riffs were pretty cool. Here's my opinion on the albumPros. The futuristic sound is totally awesome!. I can sometimes relate to the lyrics after a hard day's workCons. While it's a glimpse of what music might be in the future, it takes careful listening. Thom Yorke acts like a Kurt Cobain, which is annoying. Thom Yorke's singing is really, really, really annoying. Thom Yorke's lyrics are ok, but it could use more participation from all members. The music is like a tribute to some other bands, it's just too ripped off. They need better guitarists: Ed 'O brian and jon greenwood are overrated. Guitars are overdubbed(3 guitars is a bit too much, don't you think?). The album is the most overhyped album that i've ever heard. Radiohead is just a phase, it'll grow old quickI don't know. Buy it and see what you think"
2,I just dont care for it,I have tried many times to get behind this album. I have even tried to buy the hype. It just isn't that great. I dont even think it is good. I like the song Karma Police but that is it. One reveiwer is pointing out how we who give it a low rating must be musically immature. I disagree. I dont care for the album. Get over it.
2,Ha!,"That last review is a perfect example of what stuff like this will do to you. People who praise the hell outta this and tell people they're crazy for not liking it, are just as bad as the corporate pop fans they condemn. This band is by no means bad or untalented, I just really dislike them. But you certainly won't catch me listening to Top 40 pop anytime soon. For me, this album is not as good as people say it is. Neither is Dark Side of the Moon. Get Piper at the Gates of Dawn for a true Pink Floyd classic. And as for Radiohead, well I can make no reccomendations."
2,Boring.......do yourself a favour and stick with 'The Bends',"I got this album when it came out, and I thought it was amazing. I was wrong. You get to like this album very quickly, but, like a good old dance song, you get tired of it. Sure I think there are some good tracks but too many fillers.Most people I know who own this album for a while all say the same thing - the don't listen to it any more. Stick with The Bends - in my opinion THE album of the last 20 years!"
2,Don't get it yet,"I don't get it yet. I've listened a couple times to this album and it really seems like a wash. People are putting it in the category of other great works, but for me, you've got to have that something more then this has - maybe emotion, maybe coherence..."
2,Oh Please...,"Two stars at best from me. I have listened to this over and over (I was told I'd have to in order to like it), and still do not consider this the brilliant work of art it's been made out to be. While this album has it's moments, I would definitely not consider it worthy of all the praise it has recieved. If Radiohead are considered so hard to like and get into, then why is it that they are as insanely popular as they are? I'm thinking that just because all the critics love them, the wannabe hipsters will naturally follow. Buy this incredibly overrated album only if you know what you're getting into."
4,Brilliant,"""Exit Music"" and ""Let Down"" are two incredible tracks that genuinely raise the hair on the back of your neck. I recommend a good listening-to in the dark or on a Walkman whilst driving through a valley. However, in my opinion, they're the only two ""outstanding"" tracks. Karma Police is severely overrated - I have no idea why it's so celebrated. Then the rest, whilst good in themselves, don't compare to the moment in Exit Music when Thom Yorke climaxes with, ""AND NOW, WE ARE ONE, IN EVERLASTING PEACE."" Excellent stuff. A White-Hot Floyd."
5,Excellent,"This album is my favorite. It works as an entire piece or song by song. As weird as Yorke's voice might seem at first, it's just a powerful combination of the right sounds that create a unique experience."
5,My Favorite Radiohead Album,Love this CD and recommend it to anyone open to listening to a group that doesn't shy away from taking risks and constantly comes out with new and challenging ideas to further their listener's musical journey.
2,The Emperor's New Clothes,"The tailor has fooled you all into loving this pretentous twaddle. But look closer; behind all the hype the emperor is naked.Radiohead is far better than the average band. Their other albums of electronic or ambient rock prove it. But when this collection of a couple songs, mixed with a lot of irritating noise, came out, somebody you respect was too afraid of not liking something abstract to admit that most of this just isn't suitable for listening.doing the opposite of what the rock formula tells you to do does not make you a musical genius, you have to also write something enjoyable.go ahead and say this review wasn't helpful, but bear in mind it's an honest opinion."
1,average reviewer rating down to 4.5 what a shock,"i love radiohead for the dark winter blues i hate radiohead as much as i hate ""the magic numbers"" just as depressing with their shiny happy pap SO DEsPRESSING if you love this album good for you i admire you and don't crictise like many have..i'm writin' this review because i want to get the average rating down because some people are pissed off that's it gone down too 4.5 stars what a shame..nothin' more worse than that is there,radio turd radio turd"
2,Absolutely OVERRATED and OVERHYPED!,"I've heard 'OK Computer' enough to realize how utterly overrated, derivative, and hyped-up it is! This CD is anything but 'groundbreaking' or classic. All the sound schemes and progressions are nothing that hasn't been done better or with more passion and talent by progressive bands like Pink Floyd or The Church, who by the way, paint much more musical and moving soundscapes than the very mediocre Yorke and company! Besides, his drony, whiny voice gives me a migraine, much like the overrated bloke in 'Oasis'!"
1,save your money and wait for the new Janet Jackson,"This record is more than bad. It's embarrassing. Lots of slow songs with no dance beats or perky lyrics. Just save your money and wait for the new Janet Jackson, which will be out any day now. Trust me: her new release will blow everything else out of the water."
1,overrated beyond belief,"Radiohead. What is there to sayI bought this cd close to when it came out, and I remember how bad the album is. I just listened to it again and I couldn't listen to anything except Karma Police. Karma Police is a good song, Paranoid Android is good too; but seem to be overshadowed by experimentations by the Beatles.THis album is great if you like funeral music!So maybe its better than the 1 star, but deserves it because its just not that good.The only essential Radiohead album is The Bends. Every song is great on the Bends compared to two on OK Craputer."
1,just another boring shtuff,"boring, boring, boringoh my, it's SUCH a nuisance how boring it isI've honestly tried to listen to it, but couldn't get myself over the half of ""Karmapolice"" then stopped.Sorry everyone. I must be a very boring guy and you all must have especially good musical taste.BUT THIS ""MUSIC"" IS AS AWFULLY BORING AS THIS REVIEW."
1,I can't figure out why this album is on the list of top 100 albums ever,"I was very dissappointed when I bought this album.For some reason this albums makes it on top 100 lists of best albums of all time.This is the worst album I have ever bought or heard.The only thing that it is good for is putting you to sleep.Don't ever try and drive a car while listening to this.I liked Radioheads pablo honey album.If you are expecting this to be a good album don't believe the hype.I tryed listening to the album one more time just the other night.It is just awfull, again I fell asleep listening to it.I don't recommend this album at all unless you are having trouble sleeping.Try pablo honey that album is much better.I won't buy a Radiohead album again."
2,hoplessly dull...,"after reading so much about how this was a new ""Dark Side of the Moon"" I finally bought it. I know Dark Side of the Moon, Dark Side of the Moon is a friend of mine... trust me, OK computer is no Dark Side. There isn't a single memorable song on this sleepy bore. There is more memorable music in Time's guitar solo than this whole cd. The band sounds like they're on thorazine as they slip through one echo drenched yawner after another. that echo stuff gets old as it is listening to U2...why build a whole career out of copying it? wildly over-rated by those who haven't heard stuff from the 60s and 70s. Pop music's standards have seriously slipped and people who regard this aural sedative as a ""classic"" record are proof."
5,"Best album, ever.",This is the most important album of all time. People who don't agree with me should have their music listening privileges taken away permanently. Seriously.
5,Unbelievable!!!,"This album is like a drug..addiction is inevitable... Hypnotic, Haunting, and Beautiful...O.K. Computer is a classic!!!...I cant believe something like this was created by a human mind...."
5,The best album ever,"This album is amazing. Every song is a classic. It's a lot less rock than the bends or pablo honey, and a lot more sad, but it's better than both and if you haven't already done so GET IT NOW. It will change your life."
5,Radiohead is one of the few real rock bands left!,Radiohead's OK Computer is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to!! It can put you to sleep... or make you want to mosh.. sometimes even in the same song! Thom Yorke's voice is hypnotizing and beautiful. A must have for anyone who liked the Bends and Pablo Honey!!!
2,just okay,"I tried really hard to like this album, but couldn't. Whilst there are some good songs on there, such as the melodic 'Karma Police', the rest of them are either dull, slow or just painfully average (""no surprises"", ""fitter happier"" for instance). Maybe it deserves some credit for its poetic content, but the surrounding music is at times infuriatingly boring and similar. I like good music, and can appreciate a good work, but this, despite it's many positive reviews is one album that does not deliver."
5,Best Album of all time,"I know that's a very bold claim. This CD has not left my CD Player in two years. Ok, fine, it's a 3CD changer, but still! The songs on this album are uncredibly overpowering. The only album i can compare this to is Dark Side of the Moon. I know you're saying know, ""here's another comparison to PF"", but it's the truth. Each song plays with your emotions. By the time the tourist is played, i am exhausted. Anyone who doesn't give this album 5 stars, needs to listen to it agian and again and again.."
5,"The past, the present and the future","The concensus is practically unanimous: this is one of the best and most important albums of all times, and, in my opinion, the best rock album of the 90's. A dense, complex, melancholy-full masterpiece about humans and machines, and that deals deeply not only with our future, but our past and present as well. I can't put on pen the excitement I feel everytime I listen to this Radiohead jewel. Yet the best thing was to know that after ""Ok Computer"" they could prove to the whole world they could go far away and beyond and reinvent themselves with the admirable ""Kid A"" and the fabulous ""Amnesiac""."
3,Headed Out,I loved Pablo Honey and The Bends but OK Computer just is a little to slow and droney and whiney. I think Thom Yorke's voice is starting to get to me. But if you have'nt heard Radiohead much before I would recommend OK Computer for your first listen. Then go get Pablo Honey.
2,Not my cup of tea,"Got this cd because of one song ""Karma Police"". I love this song, the others are not really my taste. Preview the songs before you decide to download the whole album - you may love the whole thing, and if not you can download single songs."
5,To put into words what this album means to me..,"This is my first review on this site, I felt obliged to review this album because I can't believe it could be just 4.5 stars, so heres one more 5!I was a pretty young kid when I started listening to Radiohead, and I think I can safely say this cd defines my growing up. I listened to it so often through the years whenever I was feeling not quite myself and OK Computer brought things back to base. I have a ridiculous amount of music, my Dad owns a music shop so I've pretty much got cds overflowing out of cupboards. Basically, OK Computer is the most listened to cd in my collection and it is the one I value the most. As for the music technically, it's just ridiculously creative and caters for so many emotions. It soars and it cruises and it makes you think outside of the box, the sound is unlike anything else in this era."
5,Great Album,"I like this album alot. My mom bought it for me when i was like 12, I didnt like it then but a few years ago I listened to it and was overwhelmed with how great this album really is. Alot of people rag on it because people compare it to pink floyd. Im not going to compare it but it is a great album. If you dont like it then you dont have to ramble on about how bad it is, people just get tired of that."
3,Explain this,"I like this album fine. There's some great songs (""Let Down"" leaps to mind). However, I never listen to it. I may have listened to it ten times in the year I've owned it. It's in my stack of CDs, but every time I think about playing it, I end up putting something else in."
2,I want to like it...but...,"I loved, LOVED!, ""Bends"". I played it so much in the late 90's, my friends got sick of it and told me to stop playing it. I fell out of society for a while, and here I am catching up, 10-12 years later (long story). So, I figured I'd catch up with Radiohead. I'm listening to ""OK,Computer"" as I write this, and, honestly, wtf? It's gotten such great reviews. What am I missing? Sorry, but it seems like a mediocre album to me, one or two good songs (I really like ""Karma Police""), but nothing like ""Bends"" (maybe nostalgia?, but this doesn't do anything for me)."
5,Heirs to the throne,I only recently got into Radiohead and so I bought this album as it was on the recommended list at my local store and I was not disappointed. I've been a Pink Floyd fan for a long time and the grandious sweeps and the humanist message in this cd truly tips its hat to the Floyd. Pink Floyd were the greatest band to do orchestral epics and Radiohead are truly heirs to their throne. This cd is in my opinion the greatest of its kind since Dark Side of the Moon.
1,Boring.,This is a very boring record by a very boring band. Radiohead are not good songwriters. I work at a record store and nobody I work with nor serious music listening customers like Radiohead. Who likes them? Yuppie music critics who write for corporate mags. and the yuppie college kids. I don't know. Nor do I care. I suggest passing on Radiohead and listening to music that has well crafted songs and exciting to listen to.
1,"Another one of those ""Let me expand your Mind"" albums..",Please skip this trash and buy some good music. This album is just BORING!! I mean it's so boring that I almost fell asleep while listning! I am not kidding. I tried Hard to like this album But I couldnt..Truly a dissapointing album.
2,Nothing new here!,"Irritating vocals, very average musicianship. Old tricks copied from older bands. You will be disappointed if you only set your eyes on all the reviews that you hear and read here. The music is very pretentious and full of used tricks to cover up for their lack of skills. Newer rock music listeners they are easy to trick. They like this thing."
1,OK Computer is not the real Avant Garde,"I recently listened to OK Computer, then I listened to some of John Lydon's stuff with PIL (Johnny Rotten), and PIL's music is vastly superior to Radiohead's music. PIL's music is the weirdest and most innovative music I have ever heard. The instrumental part of the music is far out, and so is the vocal part. OK Computer sounds like bad pop music by comparison, it is just whiny 90's shlock pretending to be Avant Garde. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but listen to PIL and then Radiohead doing OK Computer and you will see what I mean. I don't think the people who like OK Computer have good taste in music."
5,Reminds me of childhood,got this in 1997. was 12 years old. listen to it now and it takes me back. all tracks stick like tacks.
5,Amazing,"Nick from Louisville hit the nail on the head. This album is a masterpiece. If you love Britney Spears, please don't buy this album because you read about it in Rolling Stone then give it two stars. It deserves five.This is an intense album and may not be as immediately accessable as the Bends, but like all great music, after ten listens you'll begin to see the beauty and majesty of this amazing work. You'll like it more after the twentieth listen that the first. It is not pop music. It is musical art. Don't bother comparing to anything (Pink Floyd?)... this is an original.Flawless, beginnning to end."
5,"Phew, for a second there I lost myself","It is hard to believe that this album came out around eight years ago. Bands today, Coldplay, Keane, Kaiser Chiefs, all these popular bands to hit it big owe their thanks to none other than Radiohead. OK Computer starts off with a very good beginner in Airbag, a very deep song that takes many listens to, to fully appreciate it. Actually, the entire album is very much the same. I was not a huge fan until i came back several weeks later and listened again. Paranoid Android is a 6 minute epic song that is really wonderful and you feel several different emotions at once. Other standouts on this record include Let Down, of course Karma Police, Climbing up the Walls, Lucky, and No Surprises. Thats almost the entire album. To be honest this album does not get enough credit and in my opnion SHOULD NOT IN ANYWAY BE COMPARED TO PINK FLOYD. Pink Floyd has nothing on Radiohead. Seriously buy this album. It might just change your taste in music."
5,pure genius,"From the opening guitar grunge on ""Airbag"" to the wailing `slow down' of Yorke on the last song, Radiohead's ""OK Computer"" possesses a unity and completeness that is rarely found nowadays. This album is, arguably, one of the greatest, if not the greatest, albums of the 90's. My favorites are... actually I can't name any, because they are all incredible and all add to the mood of the album. The album would not be complete with any tracks missing; each paints a separate picture that blends into the whole that is ""OK Computer."" If you need further proof, check out ""Strung out on OK Computer,"" a string arrangement of the CD that really brings out the mood."
5,Not POP Enough?,"Anyone who reviews this album and says it's not POP enough and you can't dance to it obviously shouldn't be listening to it in the first place. If empty-headed dance tracks are what you are into, buy Brittney Spears, buy Madonna, buy Duran Duran. I don't think Radiohead set-out to get the world dancing with the music on this album. However, if you want to kick off your dance shoes and put down the beer bong and leave the frat party, this might be the album for you. For me, it's the best album Radiohead has done, it's certainly the best album of 1997 and it's Top 10, maybe Top 5, of the 90's. It is absolutely an essential rock album. Of course, it's no N'Sync."
5,Brilliant! A Force to be reckoned with!,"This is probably my favorite CD (and if you like this one, I would highly recommend the Iron Lung import). It takes a few listens to really appreciate it, but once you recognize its genius, it's hard not to be blown away. In my opinion, this is where Radiohead peaked, after the primarily rock and roll sound and before the too techno current sound (although I love all their stuff). The only sad thing is that everything you listen to post-OK Computer pales a little bit in comparison--they've really raised the bar for great music."
2,Very Overrated Album,"The few dissenters who can't believe the hype this album got are bang on - this is one of the most overrated albums that I can remember. A good album, but not great ... and definitely not of ""legendary"" status as some would have us believe (and yes, I did give it the compulsory 10+ play-throughs on the CD player). Their previous album, ""The Bends"", is a far, far superior album - no question about it.If you are looking for ""Album of the Year for 1997"", I would suggest looking past this album, and on to Catherine Wheel's ""Adam & Eve"". There is NO comparison - listen to each album 10+ times, and I challenge anyone to disagree with me on this."
2,I'm not going to be very popular for this...,"but radiohead is simply not as good as they should be. And before you all go off half-cocked, telling me that I ""don't understand"" or ""don't see the hidden genius,"" let me explain something to you: There is a fine line between hidden genius and a Brittish man crying into a microphone. Radiohead is, unfortunatley, the latter. And believe me, I tried to like them. I bought this album, painstakingly listened to each song, and it just didn't do it for me. I am giving this album two stars, however, because ""No Surprises"" Is a wonderful song, and I'd hate to condemn it along with the rest of the garbage on this album."
3,"Good, but overhyped","When I bought this album I didn't know what to expect. I approached it with an open mind and an open heart, hoping to find a great album to add to my collection. Even though there are some amazing songs on this, it doesn't live to the hype. You know a great album the first time you hear it. It completely takes over your subconcious, making you go back again and agian. OK computer doesnt do it. Yeah, you may go back to Paranoid Android, Karma Police, and Subterranean Homesick Alien, but the album drags at points. Yorke's vocals become somewhat of a bother to the ears at points in songs, making you wish he would let up on the falsetto. This album is NOT complete. The reason it was so popular was that it was released in the middle of the ""boyband"" era. Most critics were starving for a rock savior and were quick to give credit to something new. If people were not so quick to jump on the bandwagon, this album would deserve its ""classic"" status"
5,Definitivamente Los Nuevos PINK FLOYD,"Alguna ves llegue a decir que jamas existiria una banda tan creativa como pink floyd.... este disco me hace pensar lo anterior mas detenidamente, sin duda este disco es una obra de arte, un paseo por la humanidad robotizada de comienzos del siglo XXI, desgarrador , perturbador COMO LOS VIEJOS DISCOS DE PINK FLOYD! , un disco genial de esos que se dan uno cada 10 años"
1,Radiohead is the worst band on earth.,"Radiohead sucks. The lead singer looks like a retard with his head bobbing around. Their music is boring too. You can tell how bad a band is when they are worshipped by rock critics and pseudo intellectuals who think they are on ""the cutting edge of rock music"" just because they like Rdaiohead. Stay away from Radiohead folks. They are BORING. BORING, BORING, BORING!!! I can't stress that word enough.If you want to listen to something more entertaining than Radiohead, here's what to do: go turn on your TV. Change it to a channel with nothing on it. One of the channels with ""snow"" on it. Just turn that up and listen to it. Even that is more entertaining than this junk."
2,I agree..should be packaged with NoDoze,"I listened to the samples and that was enough. It sounds like it would be a decent album, but it only has this many stars because of the fans. Right off the top of my head, I can think of 3 albums from the 90's that are better. Tonic - Lemon Parade, and Stone Temple Pilots first two albums. It's a shame...this generations music is so unfortunate. There are no musicians anymore. Try some 70's and 80's. Those were the best decades."
1,The beginning of the end...,"This marked the beginning of the bands, ""hey... let's try anything regardless of how obnoxious it is"" style. Just like peanuts and chewing gum, ambience and whining were never meant to be synonymous with each other. The feelings portrayed in these songs quickly lose their depth when you realize just how pretentious they really are!"
2,What a terrible singer,This band is good----jk. They do not compare to coldplay. They should learn something from coldplay in fact. BEFORE YOU ARGUE seriously put yur self in some one else's mind who has NEVER heard radiohead before. Then listen to the singer. He is whiny and quite anoyying. Almost everyone i know agrees with me. Coldplay is FAR superior. This is not really emotional music.
4,OK Computer is Very Good,"OK Computer is the second Radiohead CD I've bought, the first being The Bends, a disc I loved from first listen. Both discs are great and the contrast between the two is very interesting. The Bends rocks harder, is much more straight-ahead, and almost every song is brilliant. OK Computer is more experimental, less structured, and at times comes off like the wonderful soundtrack to a strange movie. But in terms of melody, which I feel sets Radiohead apart from lesser bands, OK Computer probably has the edge. You just can't say no to those awesome melodies! The two discs actually compliment each other quite well. If you're going to buy some Radiohead music, I suggest you get both if you can. Rock on Radiohead. You're in a league of your own and I love ya."
5,This is the one,"When you buy this, there are no doubts, or I should say no surprises: It's a classic album. Song by song, it never fails to impress. The vocal performance put Thom Yorke among the top rock vocalists of all time. The music is equally impressive as the band fool around with odd time signatures and make full use of their musical skills, creating moody, atmospheric landscapes. Jonny Greenwood's guitar work is absolutely stunning. Radiohead are now a group that generate a lot of hype and are generally considered the best British group in recent times with many copy cat follower bands. The music on this album is generally responsible for this. Ok Computer is a landmark album that belongs in your collection."
5,Whoa,"This is Radiohead's best. Their art rock techno indie feel is inspiring and masterful. It's an indescribable tour-de-force. The darkness and depth of the music is beyond words. OK Computer is, in short, a phenomenal CD."
3,Amazing,"I find it amazing that people still try to beat each other into submission over what is ""good music"". The whole point of listening to music is to be entertained. Just because you don't enjoy something doesn't mean you have the right to tell everyone else they are stupid for listening to it. Along the same lines, if you like something, that doesn't mean everyone else has to like it as well. OK Computer is a good album, IN MY OPINION. I enjoy its different themes and I comend Radiohead for attempting to say something with their music. Now, just because I like it doesn't mean everyone else will. My suggestion is to borrow it from someone and listen to it a few times. If you like it, buy it. If you don't, at least you personally gave it a try instead of listening to someone on the internet talk out of their a**. Wake up people, and make some decisions for your self.""Life is a series of moments. And the only moment of which we can be aware is this moment right now"""
3,Not too bad,"With every Radiohead release i've heard i only really like half the songs on the albums which cant really be helped, i like the diversity and experimentation of the band considering how popular they are they havent really been effected by the mainstream which is great but Thom Yorkes voice really is ear piercing at times when at other times he writes a great song you can really empathise with. They are still a breath of fresh air in the stale pop mainstream dominated by lack of talent though."
3,Possibly the most overrated album of the '90s,"I like OK Computer. It has an awesome cover, and I always am happy to hear the opening notes of Airbag (my computer plays albums randomly). BUT, it is NOT the album of the '90s. Even masterpieces like Karma Police and Climbing Up The Walls can't make up for songs like Electioneering and Fitter Happier (if that even counts as a song). Radiohead sound amateur in many places on this album. The drums are often poorly recorded, sounding very tinny and trebbly, and most of the guiter distortion is overdriven, making the music sound very cheap. It amazes me that so many people give this album 5 stars. A 5 star album for me is one that is a solid, cohesive journey all the way through, with every track being very good, not with some (4) being awesome and the rest mediocre. This is indeed a good album, and possibly worthy of 4 stars, but I don't find it worthy of 5 stars, and it is certainly not the album of the '90s."
5,Timeless Classic!!,"This has to be one the best albums recorded in the last 20 years. Rock and Roll at it's core! it is an example of how there are still artists out there that have real talent as musicians and not icons. Artistic, melody driven, and unusual it transcends what most music has become, it is truly a masterpiece and the finest recording In my opinion this band has released. ""The Bends"" and ""Hail to the Thief"" are my other favorites."
3,"Sadly, It's only half an album to me","I really love the the first 6 tracks of the album. But at the point where it hits track 7 and the computer voice starts talking, I immediately switch to the next CD in my changer. Yes I've listened to the rest of the tracks many many times trying to like them. But they are all too slow and sound relatively the same (I confess I like more upbeat music normally). Electioneering is OK, but it's much better to end with ""Karma Police"". Overall, it was worth the purchase (I play this CD once a month or so just listening to the first 6 tracks)."
5,Quintessential Album for any music lover,"My brother gave me a bootleg copy of this album about six years or so ago. He couldn't contain his displeasure for the album! After one listen, it immediately became my favorite album of the genre of all time. The album plays like a cascading narrative of social angst, and save for one song that could have potentially been a pop hit, this is a rock work of art. It is rare that an album speaks to the moment, but is simutaneously timeless. Thom Yorke evokes powerful emotions through his higher-pitched balladeering. This is expressed as another wonderful highlight of the album, as the instrumental arrangement perfectly blend with the spirit of each track. Please, don't listen to the samples; do yourself a favor and give this entire album a listen. Individual tracks, let alone any snippet, will not give the justice due to this classic piece. Honestly, I'll have to give this a 10 out of 10."
5,You must have it,"Vinyl is an excellent way to hear Radiohead, a band wich deserves be heared with a high definition and clarity in each sound."
3,"It's good, not great","Three brilliant songs (the singles - Paranoid Android, No Surprises, Karma Police). Some average Radiohead, some dreary nonsense (Fitter, Happier). The British press NEEDED an 'OK Computer' in 1997 with not a lot going on musically during this time. This record marked the beginning of Radiohead Mark 2, sans guitars and intelligent lyrics. The hype here isn't worth it - The Bends is a MUCH better album, where EVERY song is strong and doesn't require the skip button. Don't get me started on the pretentious Kid A..."
5,Single best CD of The 90's.,"Some say 'Nevermind' by Nirvana is the king of the 90's hill, but my vote goes towards Radiohead's brilliant 1997 release OK Computer. Though nearly 3 years old, I'm still listening to it. The cd is just so amazing in it's simplicity, and yet overwhelming with it's technicality. Every instrument in the Radiohead arsenal is brought out and used to it's best extent, whether it be the atmospheric strings on 'Climbing Up The Walls' or the acousic crescendo of 'Exit Music [for a film].' The album plays like an epic, an examination of post modern society that isn't as 'post modern' as we'd like to think. This album further continues the experiment they began with 'The Bends.' Radiohead has progressively became the greatest band I have ever heard. [This coming from a guy who used to say the same thing about Beck.] Radiohead is now one of the most vital entities in music today. And I'm already obsessively gathering info from the band's official site about the next album."
5,"Hands Down, A Masterpiece","One of the best albums I own. It's an acquired taste, and when I first heard it, I didn't really like it. But once it grows on you, you can't let go of it. Every song is amazing, and there's lots of hidden messages and themes left for us to decipher. I have listened to this album all the way through (no skipping) probably about ten times (I just purchased it). It is amazing, and it's the only album that I *must* complete every time I listen to it. I can't just play one song and that's that. It has to be all or nothing.It also has many similarities to popular culture, such as to the films ""Fight Club"", ""1984"" (also the book), and ""The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". This makes for an even more interesting listen.Own it. NOW!"
3,"OK, I guess","I used to like this a lot more. It is a good album (not as good as the bends however) but somehow it has not aged well. I find myself not playing it a lot nowadays.Other milestones have aged better (Dark side, Automatic for the people, Time out of mind etc)"
2,I don't get it,"I have listened to this album 4 or 5 times now and I still dont understand why people think its soo great. I mean this album was recently voted the greatest album ever in a channel 4 '100 greatest' program here in the UK, and I also seem to remember it getting the same accolade from 'Q Magazine' back in the late nineties. I just dont get it. There are 2 songs I do like on here, 'Paranoid Android' and 'No Surprises'. In fact, 'No Surprises' is probably the most beautiful song I've ever heard. But as for the rest of the album, it sucks. I dunno, maybe I'm not mature enough to appreciate this alleged classic, but I do reccomend people buy this album because of its critical acclaim and see for themselves if they can figure out whats so good about it."
1,THOM WILL BOW TO HASSELHOFF,"OK Computer = good album1200 chodes thinking that THEIR review will be special = badDAVID HASSELHOFF IS THE GREATEST SINGER EVER!!!the song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
2,1 word: boring,"This album is excellent for one reason: it will help you fall fast asleep. Skip the sleeping pills if you have trouble sleeping, cuz this baby does the trick every time for me, and probably everybody else. It's no wonder ""OK Computer"" severely flopped, who could ever like this stuff?? Let's be honest, Pink Floyd went out with disco, why would you try to copy their sound? Now, I will admit, there's a song on here with a cool animated video (not sure which one) where a little kid and his friend shuffle around town and climb up a flagpole and harass a fat guy and stuff, and I like that aspect of this album! But otherwise, it's pure overblown and overindulged garbage, for people who attend college only!Another thing I don't like is the whiny lead singer who needs voice lessons, or maybe some therapy.I liked this band better when they were grunge, as on the first album.Well, I'll talk to you later."
2,"Not exactly ""O.K.""","I'm sorry, but this album is not deserving of the praise its been generated. I found the album poor, and sadly, disappointing. There are a few good songs on this album, but a better investment would be ""The Bends"", which is more lyrically and melodically sound."
1,Over rated & Over played,"I know I'm outnumbered here by Radiohead fanatics but as a longtime devotee of music encompassing all music styles (psych,jazz, blues, techno, ambient, HM, classical etc)I'm giving an objective opinion of this over rated band. Sure they have their moments, but this album, which is representative of their work, is possibly reasonable fodder of this genre but pales into insignificance compared to hundreds of other bands who aren't getting anywhere near the airplay Radiohead is getting. Sure it's fine if you're into Smiths-like (& the Smiths were a vastly superior band)Manchester unemployed, rainy day, try-hard undergraduate scenes but puuuurlease don't put them on a pedestal they don't deserve. Their output will be looked back in 10-20 years with an opinion of mediocrity. Their vibe and style is symptomatic of the nervous 90's and will be looked at in a similar manner as post-grunge, mid-80's Thatcherite-like stuff. Now fire away."
5,Not just Ok but Amazing,SIMPLY THE BEST ALBUM PUT OUT IN HISTORY AND IF DONT AGREE THEN GO TO HELL!!! BUY THIS NOW! I MEAN RIGHT NOW WHY R U STILL READING THIS FOR I TOLD U TO BUY IT RIGHT NOW GO!!!
2,"Banal, overblown","I've been hearing about reviews that boast how great this album is. The editorial on Amazon even compares it with the major works of Pink Floyd. But don't let them fool you. Just like the rest of these bands of the 90s, listening to one would mean listening to all. There's basically not much difference between them. These bands have no soul nor any creativity and frankly they don't even the slightest trace of the spirit of rock. hype about these bands were just created by media for commercial sake. They are totally overblown. Try any album by the likes of the Kinks and you'd get more musical substance from these bands. 1 star for the music and 1 star for not having the grunge noise that those US bands like to use so much."
2,A Bitter Sterile Rock Effort,"The first couple of times I heard this record I must admit I was drawnto it, the slick production, excellent guitar tones, nifty computer andelectronic sounds. It is definitely good ear candy, and has someraucous and rocking moments.After repeated listening however, I've come to the conclusion that thisalbum is really pretty devoid of meaning or emotion. The mostemotionally engaging song on the album (in my opinion) is Let Down,but even this song's lyrics are basically without meaning. Most of thesongs are similar in this respect. The words seem disconnectedcompletely from the music, and while the music is almost always prettyand complete, it fails to engage one beyond an intellectual curiosity.The album is perhaps perfectly suited to it's title in this respect."
1,"""Don't mistake lack of talent for genuis""","I've tried to like Radiohead for a long time now. I've really tried. But I just can't, and it amazes me that they've pulled the wool over the eyes of the majority of the world. I think people like this band because other people have told them they should, not because they're actually a good band. This is the most bland muzak ever created. There's no skilled musicianship and no hooks, nothing to listen for, and they're fronted by a guy who couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag. I couldn't think of a more highly overrated band. Best band on the planet? These guys aren't even the best band in their own genre. Look to bands like Coldplay or Catherine Wheel for decent Brit Art Pop. Seriously, Radiohead fans, these guys have you all fooled!"
1,The most overrated band of the 90's,"Everyone loves Radiohead. But why? The band, and this CD are boring. It's not very interesting, even if I do like one song, ""Paranoid Android"", but I just can't get into this album. Maybe after a few more listens I'll like it a bit more. It's definitely not something I never want to hear again in my life, but for now, this is how I'm feeling about it. That is all."
1,Oh No...Not 4.5 stars!!,I just love how some dude was pissed about the overall rating going from 5 to 4.5..I mean just Deal with it!! peace.
5,One of the greatest CD's Ive ever listened to,"I just got into Radiohead about a year ago and they are already my favorite band. Mainly because of this CD. This coming from a fan of thrash/tech metal and electronic music. I just cant get over how emotional and stunning this album is. Every song is a masterpiece on its own. I almost consider myself an idiot for not appreciating this album sooner. I love the theme and direction of the CD. It may take a few listens to really understand this album, but once you get it, you'll GET IT. This CD deserves 6 stars."
2,"Dead, dead, deadski!","I understand why people still salivate over this record. If you like Thom Yorke sounding like a dog begging for a walk, Johnny Greenwood playing guitar in boxing gloves, lyrics that I thought were deep until I read some poetry (Brodsky,T.S Elliot, whatever) - you'll consider this the best record ever made/blablabla but ,seriously, EVEN SOME OF YOU eventually will get tired of it.Me,I've just about had enough of Radiohead.I never once regretted selling my copy of OK Computer."
2,the best album of all times?,"How dare several reviewers call this the greatest album of all times, and Radiohead the new Beatles? The last band to be named the new Beatles whose name I have forgotten must be singing in Las Vegas now doing their farewell tour. Its ok to enjoy this album but only an ignorant or a joker would call it the best album of all times. Grow up and listen to more albums."
3,OK Tuneage,"Just 2 years ago, this was the CD that was voted the best CD in the universe. Damn, i never thought the best CD in the universe would be so plodding and slow. The musicianship is terrific but the CD seems to be less than the sum of its parts. It's too dark and depressing for my tastes. It seems to only look at one side of the spectrum, unlike genuine classics such as XO, Mr Bungle, Angel Dust, Ten, and Nevermind, albums that aren't afraid to lighten up every now and again. Sorry if I like a little style with my substance. Some terrific tunes here, such as Paranoid Android, Airbag, Let Down and Subterranean Homesick Alien (4 of the first 5 songs by the way) but the second half moves at a snail like pace."
5,Magnificent! A REAL art rock album...,"I'm a great Pink Floyd fan... I've heard about Radiohead, but never pay attention to them... Yesterday I bought OK computer: It's, I think, the best disc I've ever heard... (And i have Sgt Pepper, Dark side of the moon, Nevermind, and other historical records) The musical perfectionis almost everywhere in this album, the instrumentation complexity is incredible... Just hear Paranoid Android (I said ""hear"", just listen to it with a lot of attention), it's the most original (and complex)song of the album, although all songs are great... Definitely, a must buy for everyone that wants to hear some astounding music."
5,Three years have passed and it still sounds fresh.,"This album contains three classics on a par with ""A day in the Life."" First, Paranoid Android, with the amazing guitar work that has Brian May wishing he'd taken more lessons. Not to mention the vocal harmonies. Next is ""Let Down"" with it's thematic examination on the loneliness of airports. It successfully merges 5/4 and 4/4 rhythms to climax with a dual vocal that is truly amazing (and Thom's E is as powerful as any other singer's high C). And then there is the lullabye, ""No Surprises."" It's not easy to write a lullabye about the meaningless of everyday life.These three standouts (for all of rock) are combined with a more than stellar cast. There isn't a weak track on this album. Even as great as these three are, the heart of the album is arguably the esoterically personal ""Exit Music."" Mellotron choirs combine with acoustic guitar to form an unsetlling masterpiece.The greatest album, ever."
5,OK Computer more than OK,"I am a new Radiohead fan. That's right, it is only recently that I took the Radiohead plunge and it all began with their latest album ""In Rainbows."" After that, I was hooked. In order to appease my fix I started purchasing all of their albums on Amazon.com. OK Computer was not a disappointing follow up, but rather a great discovery. It is a bit darker than ""In Rainbows,"" and the industrial sounds mixed with rock riffs and the brilliance of Thom York's lyrics and vocals, OK Computer was the perfect follow up for me. I recommend it to anyone who believes in higher conscienceness, or, amazing music infiltrated with substance. I give it 2 VERY enthusiastic thumbs up."
5,absolute genius,i cant think of words to describe this album. its incredible. it almost always makes me cry. if you cant scrape together 15 dollars to buy it you're missing out in a big big way
4,GREAT !!,"Energetic, creative, metal coming from the heart!!! This CD by Saxon reveals with details what was the NWOBHM in the 80's. THis CD has Saxon playing powerful, but simple and rocking, songs, with drummer Pete Gill playing amazingly, Biff singing all his chords, the guitar duo of Oliver and Quinn not so good on solos, but amazing on riffs and bass player S. Dawnson delivering a good rhythm section. ""Princess of the Night"" is an ultimate classic!"
3,Why Such High Ratings?,"Why such high ratings and remarks for Denim and Leather? This album, IMHO, marked the beginning of the end of what was a super cool metal/rock band. Their first three albums are killer all the way through with the band being tight, hungry, and dedicated for success. Imagine Iron Maiden meets Black Sabbath...that's sorta what Saxon sounded like. Check out their debut album, specifically 'Rainbow Theme/Frozen Rainbow'. That cut gives you a classic idea of this bands talent. They followed up with Wheels of Steel and Strong Arm of the Law, both excellent and with even more metal crunch. By the time Denim & Leather was released, Saxon was slowing down from the classic symptons of success...complexity, mediocrity, and writer's block. This one's good, but the first three were the BEST! Trust me -- Spike in Florida"
3,Columbia Watch,"The watch arrived with one of the pins connecting it to the band unattached. When I contacted Fossil they gave me the choice of returning it or taking it to a local Fossil store. Luckily, the local store wasn't too far away and the pin was replaced in a matter of minutes and in time to give the watch as a Christmas present."
2,Yikes! Small screen movie!,I can't believe nobody prominently mentioned that this dvd is a cheat! Why the weasels put out a film with no mention that it's shrunk to half size on your plasma is beyond me.Why can't Obama do something good and require federal legislation to put warning labels on movies that are cheaters?
2,Jr Bonner,"If you liked the original music from the film like I did, don't buy this DVD, they've changed the music! Otherwise the movie's fine. But I was very disappointed with this change."
1,Where's the original music !,"What happened to the original music? BUYER BEWARE:ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS HAS HAD IT'S MUSIC CHANGED....AND IT IS NOT MENTIONED ON THE JACKET!...RIP OFF!....THANK GOD THAT I KEPT MY LBX JAPANESE LASERDISC. Too Bad, as the print is great and the packaging is nice. But without the song ""Arizona Morning""...it don't matter. Isn't this movie about being honest and not messing around with old things?--Charpy"
4,"An Easygoing, Charming Experience","If you're a McQueen fan (like me), order this DVD.This is a secret gem because it is not frequently played on the air as are many McQueen movies.The Bonners - Ida Lupino, Robert Preston, Joe Don Baker, and Steve - give a geniune Texas-family feel. The 4th of July parade appears perfectly real because it was real - you couldn't have staged such realism. The rodeo scenes are beautifully terrifying. The humor is nice and easy, not over-the-top. And Steve is in fantastic condition, spry as a young cat, though he was in his early-40s when it was filmed.Make popcorn, sit down with your kids, turn it on, and get your mind off the whole world for awhile."
2,need some enhancements,The book is not well organized even though the organization is very important for such a book with a lot of contents.
5,Great Read for anyone in the adoption triad,"As a first mother I found Adoption Reader to be enlightening because it talked about the perspective of adoption from all viewpoints. Okay, some of the adoptive mother stuff was irritating, but all the essays had the voice of authenticity. This would be a good read for prospective adoptive parents because they are more likely to read our voice packaged with those of adoptees and adoptive parents.Wadia-Ellis, an adoptive mother, made excellent choices on contributors. The writing is first-class throughout."
5,Between Sepultura and Soulfly,"If you're a fan of Sepultura and Soulfly you'll find that Nailbomb will nail your taste for this type of music. In the original album you could find the ""recipe"" to create an actual nailbomb, the member comply and exceed all your expectations. If you like to learn more about the roots of the group just listen to Sepultura (just up to the Chaos AD album), Soulfly and Fudge Tunnel."
4,industrial metal,"even though its not the Heaviest cd ever, its still filled to the top with AWSOME songs. this is one of few cd's that can be played through without skipin songs. Max said he didnt want it sounding to industrial and that they didnt promote shooting ppl like on the cover, just showing what happens in that country"
4,not as gay as the band members,"considering how both max from sepultura and alex newport from fudge tunnel are both homosexuals, i thought this album would be an all-out namblafest. it's not, maybe because both max and alex are trying to compensate for how utterly gay their primary bands are."
4,Surprisingly Effective Spoon Feeding,"While this book and companion CD can seem a bit silly at first, they are worth doing. The material sticks with you, and the concepts are clearly and well explained. Even difficult concepts (ie. the difference between confounding and interaction) are handled well. It was some spoonfeeding, but the material has stuck with me in more advanced courses - I keep going back to this as a starting point."
5,"A hard-hitting, gloomy album, a must for all metal lovers","Burn My Eyes is one of the best metal albums I have ever heard. Each track adds a new feeling to the album while adhereing to the overall themes of personal, political, and social chaos. The songs themselves consist of agressive, distorted, deep power-chord riffs(performed by Robb Flynn and Logan Mader), trammeling drum beats (performed by Chris Kontos), and rolling base lines (performed by Adam Duce) which punctuate the guitars and drums. All of this adds to the melencholy lyrics written by Robb Flynn, who, in my opinion, steals the show with his grating voice and fast-paced solos. These four brilliant musicians, the merit of whom is shown in the first track ""Davidian"", have pieced together a magnificent album, a must for all metal lovers!"
3,"3,5 stars",A nice first effort by Machine Head. Its really heavy with very very heavy guitars. Its a little monotonic but the adrenaline is high. Personally i dont like the vocals. I would prefer somebody like Tom Araya to sing in this kind of music.
3,OK but....,I think this album has just a couple of very amazing songs then only anonymous tracks that come back directly from VIOLENCE period.
2,pointless music with no heart,"Metalcore - the epitome of mainstream garbage that Americans love.Pass on this and move onto bands that matter; such as Kreator, Death, Dismember or Suffocation."
5,MACHINE HEAD RULES!!,"This is easily one of the BEST HEAVY METAL ALBUMS EVER MADE. BUY THIS CD NOW. Also, the drumming on this particular MH album freakin' rules!"
5,Machine Head Rocks!!!!,Awesome. Can't quit listening to it. Love Machine Head and this is one of their best!!!!!
4,machine head's true masterpiece,"well, this is where Machine Head opened the book, yet it's sadly the only chapter of their career worth your time. (of course, this is only my opinion, which is based on the fact that if you want METAL, latter Machine Head, will never satisfy). Who remember's Violence, the band Rob Flynn was in prior to forming Machine Head? Well if you don't, you're better off. Violence, mucially was decent 80s thrash, but vocally it was unbearable (an acquired taste to say the least). Anywho, I think it was great for Flynn to form Machine Head and give us some real great metal with ""Burn My Eyes"". It's just too bad they didn't keep it up..."
5,Oh...my...God!!!,"This is one of the best metal albums I have ever heard! It is the shiznat! The first time I ever heard ""Davidian"" I nearly pee-ed my pants! These boys from the biggity, biggity O (dat be Oakland, fool!) tear it up! And their lyrics are really socially conscious, too. Makes you think about life in a new way! Word up! And to that fool who says ""I hate when people write reviews that say blah! blah! blah!"" you need to lighten up, homie! Peace out, y'all! --Kelly Magovern"
4,Great heavy stuff!,"I put on the headphones in the CD store and was instantly blown away by Davidian! I had this and 2 other CD's I was trying to choose between, but this one caught my attention straight away. I'm usually more of a hardcore metal fan (eg Deftones, Spineshank) but I was very impressed with this. It's not my favourite type of music, but it's close, and it's damn good metal!"
5,Machine Head rules,"This is the best debutalbum ever made. The first time is listened to it, it completely blew me away. Growling vocals, heavy guitars, excellent drums and kick bass. This is the end. Machine Head kicks butt !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Over-praised,"Machine Head's debut is really not half as exciting as everyone makes it out to be. I will give credit where it is due and ""Davidian"" starts this album off perfectly, such a great song. ""Old"" carries on in the same vein another really good metal song. From here this album takes a nosedive into mediocrity. I find it hard to really listen to the rest of the album all in one sitting. Maybe the reason this album has received such high praise is because all the albums they released until ""Through The Ashes of Empires"" were all ten times worse giving this one a bit of false perspective."
5,Oh Yeah!,"Y'know, it doesn't take much talent to shout or scream in a cd, but it does take talent to make you want to sing a long with the screams, shouts, etc... And Machine Head has this talent, along with Pantera. By far one of the heaviest cds I own And thats saying a lot."
2,tomato plants,These tomato plants arrived quickly and unharmed. They didn't come with any growing instructions which would be helpful but thatprobably would make them cost more. Otherwise I'm satisfied with the product.Update June 19. 2010These plants turned out to be Jalapeño peppers instead of tomatoes!!!!last time I'll order from this company!!!
1,Austrailian Dream doesn't work,I bought the 2 oz size for $18 at Walmart. Tried on my arthritis hands and knees. I didn't get any relief at all.
4,Works great on my lower back,Works well after a long day of hard work building homes. I use it on my lower back and feel better without drugs.
2,Australian Dream Arthritis Cream,"I have osteo arthritis. The dream did not help me whatsoever. It did not relieve any of my pain, and I returned it for their money back guarantee."
3,No odor,"The cream goes on smooth without stickiness or odor. However, really provides very little relief for muscle pain. I would not recommend."
3,"works OK, but not as well as Blue Goo","I bought this from the pharmacy when we ran out of Blue Goo. It does seem to help my tennis elbow somewhat, but no where near as well as Blue Goo. Blue Goo is the absolute best (way better than Icy Hot or other menthol creams out there). There is something about emu oil, MSM, and menthol that really seems to do the trick. Australian Dream doesn't have the menthol."
3,It's alright but too pricy for what it is,"I've had better result with Blue-Emu - It's half the price - and - it's a USA Product... I mistakenly trusted the Mike Huckabee Ad on the Australian Dream Cream - He is ""DREAMing"" if he thinks it really works..."
5,This really does work.,"We are a family of Triathletes, and Iron man participants. I read about this, thought it was worth a try, and it works good for before and after training, and for all aches and pains we found"
2,worth trying,I haven't used this much since I received it. It feels good when applying it. I might have to update this after I've used the product longer.
1,Austrilian dream cream,This is nonsense. Look up the ingredients on medscape. Look up the product. This is a complete scam. Shame on amazon and shame on all of the major drug store chains like Kinneys. I fell for it in my desperation. I hope that You will not. Amazon i thought better of you. I will think twice before I rely on those reviews again.
1,Franco fails,"Totally uninteresting attempt to promote a Spanish band in two films... this one and ""Killer Barbys"" also by Franco.There's nothing of interest here, poor music, plot (even by Franco standards)."
2,"Jones and Lange smolder, Torn founders","The acting in this is fine; Lange is delectably sultry, Jones is excellent as a washed-up drunk.But the accent Rip Torn uses in this has got to be the worst Southern accent ever committed to film (and that includes Kevin Costner's execrably awful accent in Oliver Stone's 'JFK'). Sounds like Foghorn Leghorn channelling Leon Redbone. I broke up laughing at how bad it was.Agreed, this is much better than the Taylor-Newman-Ives Hollywood piece. But viewers might want to check out the version made with Olivier as Big Daddy, Natalie Wood as Maggie and Robert Wagner as Brick. Excellent all around, and Olivier sounds much more like an arrogant Southern planter than Rip Torn does. At least you're not laughing at it."
5,One of the all time greats,"Mendacity fills the air and the script. Taylor and Newman have to be the sexiest stars to ever light up a screen and Ives is the scene stealer supreme. Visually its like a soap opera as 90% of the story is in the big house. But the words that come rushing out of these marvelous actors isn't about just sex, its about life and everything that makes life worth living. These classic faces and this classic storytelling put this film on par with the best art ever made."
5,A Classic,"Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives. What more does one have to say? This movie is marvelous."
5,Best Elizabeth Taylor movie,Best Elizabeth Taylor movie in my opinion. I lost my DVD so decided to replace it. I am very happy with it. It's in great condition. Arrived quickly. Happy with seller.
5,Raw Emotion on Screen,"'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' is based on Tennessee William's play of the same name. I do shamefully admit that I have not read or seen the play but I do intend to. It is about the trials and tribulations of a Southern family who learn that the patriarch, Big Daddy, played brilliantly by Burl Ives, is dying and how they want to stake their claim on the inheritance he will give. It concentrates on the problems in the marriage between Brick(Paul Newman:those EYES!) and Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor), the favouritism towards Brick, and Brick's alcoholism.Paul Newman & Elizabeth Taylor gave terrific performances in this film. They are the kind of actors who co-exist perfectly and I wished they could have done more films.This is a fantastic film. Don't miss out."
2,"Love the movie, but the dvd was messed up!","One of my all time favorite movie, I can watch over and over, but the dvd kept skipping and stopping!"
4,Superb,"Acting doesn't come any better than this. Newman and Taylor have such chemistry its unbelievable, and although the movie may drag in certain parts, overall it is a great character study.Taylor is heartbreaking as the sexually deprived wife as Newman, a hardened man who suspects his wife of infidelity. Once again the theme of homosexuality is present ( as it is in all of Williams' plays), but in the movie it is thankfully downplayed and subtle. The definitive film version of the play, whose highlights are pretty much every scene in which Maggie and Brick are alone in their room bickering."
5,"The ""Cat"" entertains fiercely.","Riveting performances by these celebrated actors hold one throughout the movie. Much enjoyed the educational commentary by Tennessee Williams' biographer, Donald Spoto. The movie was especially enjoyable to me, as this was the very first New York City stage play that I saw - a memorable event in itself."
3,Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"I had always wanted to see ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", and I finally did. The movie gets off to a slow start, however, Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are wonderful, although I believe that Taylor could have done a better job acting. The movie is about an extremely dysfunctional family, gradually coming to a climax and a predictable ending. I enjoyed simply watching Taylor and Newman, two of my favorite actors. I am old enough to remember Taylor back in the day, but did not see most of her movies, and Amazon gives me the chance to catch up."
3,"Cat Hot, Hubby Not","Taylor does something spectacular for underwear; she is her most beautiful and had no problem playing the ultimate belle from hell. Newman, on the other hand, was on glue I think--you wanted to pull his crutch out from under him to get some kind of a reaction. Big Daddy Ives hams it up, but it works. You feel sweaty throughout the whole movie."
2,Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"I really did not enjoy this movie. I ordered it to see Eliz. Taylor thinking it would be really good, however it was mainly dull and not enjoyable to me."
4,Great Teaching Tool,I used this video to help my high school seniors better understand the play. This was an amazing version of the play. The production stayed true to the script and Paul Newman was a powerful and enthusiastic stage manager (narrator). One of the best versions of the play I've seen. It is very moving.
1,The 1940 film version remains the BEST,"The 1940 film version of the 1938 play remains the BEST with an ending that playwright Thornton Wilder approved of. From the original 1938 cast of the New York production, Frank Craven owns the role of the Stage Manager."
2,Could be better,"This movie is very true to the original story, but it is very boring. My class begged me to turn it off."
2,I couldn't finish it,"I was impressed and enjoyed Wiccan Mysteries (would give it a 5 out of 5 for what it is worth) by this very author and so I purchased this book and I thought it would be as well thought out. Instead as I read it I found most of it was watered down basics of the foundation of ""wiccan magick"" and I would suggest many other books for a beginner before this one; which was written with out the background information. Overall I found that it didn't say anything particularly refreshing, ingenuitive or really thought provoking to keep me interested. One of my disagreements with this book was a chapter on stones/crystals that was very inadequate. If you like to read books that sound more like folklore then magick or a path to spirituality rather then a little stroll in the lifeless park of religion then you might just Like this book a great deal."
3,More like a textbook,"While this book does have some interesting information, it reads more like a textbook. It's a bit dry and tedious to work through. Also, while it touches on several subjects, it doesn't really go into much detail about any of them. For example: The sigils/moonchart in one of the glossaries .... it could have used a bit more detail on how it works. Though the herb section was interesting. It leaves many questions and a bit of confusion on some things, though in other areas in gives answers I wasn't even asking the questions to. *S*"
3,"Good, but confused","Let's start off with the fact that I liked this book. There are many, many interesting techniques within the book and a lot of great Occult Theory. However, this book shouldn't be presented as a straight out explanation of Wiccan practices. Many of the explanations and theories in the book come more from the Cabala and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn than any Wiccan tradition I've ever encountered. Regardless, this book is a good buy for the informed reader and practitioner."
5,so good,"This book rocks. It's the best book ever on wiccan magick. Raven knows what he is talking about and and at least, he explains the mechanisms of magick like no one else (Wiccan authors) has ever done! THE BEST BOOK EVER."
2,What? say again?,"Seems to be an ok book, if you can understand any of it, which I could not! There seem to be some good points, but mostly stuff I already knew. Very confusing book."
2,A normal wiccan book.,"This is a normal wiccan book about magick nothing special.As for the person who said he wouldnt be made a fool of by believing wicca was an ancient tradition,he said it was created by Aliester crowley and then presented to Cuningham. lol. Wicca was created by Gerald Gardner in the 1950's, Aleister Crowley didnt even agree that he should do this in fact crowley had other plans for what Gardner should do. As for cunningham he didnt jump on the wagon until much later. Cuningham did change wicca alot by presenting the solitary path but he was far from having anything to do with creating it."
3,Dissapointing,I bought Wiccan Magick off of amazon for 1.50 and Im really glad I did because I wouldn't have paid anymore for it if I would have known what I was in for. Ravenn Grimassi has always been my top favorite author so I was beyond excited to read Wiccan Magick. If I were a beginner Id think Grimassi was saying that Wicca is more folklore than magick. Id give this book to someone who wants more historical facts and references than magickal information.
4,"Informative,indispensable,and flawed all at once","Raven Grimassi has given us a book which does something few books ever do. He actually explains the HErmetic Mysteries in SIMPLE, DIRECT LANGUAGE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND! However, there are times when he seems to contradict himself, which I imagine is the fault of Llewellen's bad editing. Also, in explaining the passage of power from one plane to another, he uses a metaphor which assumes that the hierarchies of our society are somehow mirrors of an Astral Hierarchy. Other than a few little glitches, the book is very informative, thought mainly for experienced practitioners. Beginners might get a bit confused."

1,Just terrible,"Dreadful book about a wealthy Boston family, their gay sons and assorted boring characters. I only picked this up because the author is local and I heard it was a comedy. Sadly it was NOT funny. The story makes little to no sense and jumps around so much it's utterly bewildering. ALL the characters are unlikable (even themain characters Gyles and Cornelia) and nobody talks like these people. Thedialogue is stitled and when it tries to be funny it's just embarrassing. I was constantly lost and trying to make heads or tails out of this. To make matters worse the author introduces characters quickly and (after a number of pages) explains who they are and what they ahve to do with the story! AND he gives constant long paragraphs to explain what a certain place looks like. Why? Also if Cornelia had said ""My Goddess"" just ONE more time I would have screamed! This is the first book in a trilogy and I have NO desire to read the other two! Skip this one."
1,"Horrible, horrible, quality!","I love ""Fantasy Island,"" but never in my life have I seen a DVD with picture quality this bad!"
1,RERUNS OF THE SERIES,THERE ARE 3 EPISODES ON THIS DVD THAT ARE RERUNS OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES. I HAVE BOTH SEASONS. THIS IS NOT A RETURN TO FANTASY ISLAND( MEANING SOMETHING NEW) ITS A COPY OF AN EXISTING EPISODES. TOTALL RIP OFF..DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE THE 1ST AND 2ND SEASONS.
5,"I""m Waiting for the Rest of the Seasons!!","I bought Season One of Fantasy Island from Amazon quite some time ago. It is a series I definately want to add to my collection. This was a one of a kind show. I don't know where the hold up is, but I'd sure like to have the rest of the series!!!!!"

2,Lousy.,"This entry in the McNally Saga is a bit of a let-down -- especially coming right after Lardo's ""McNally's Dilemma"" which is probably the all time best McNally novel. In ""McNally's Alibi"" we get to see Archy take leave of his senses. The only time he seems to do anything right is in trying to pick up Officer Georgy O'Hara, which he does quite nicely. I agree with those who think Connie Garcea needs to take a hike. That one has outlived her welcome. It is time Archy got a new love interest.Hopefully what we saw in this novel won't happen again.If you really must read this book then do so. But borrow it from the local library instead of buying it and spend your money on something more worthy of your attention."
3,Good Not Great,I didn't enjoy this novel as much as the last. While Vincent Lardo development of Archy McNally is great. The plot wasn't as interesting as the last. And you pretty guess the ending before the end. Only great part to me is Consuela Garcia not being a doormat to Archy anymore. I mean Cmon Connie wake up and smell the coffee. You deserve better.
2,didn't read far enough and didn't realize it was a kit,"it's still waiting for me to put it together...I don't like the material it's made from,,,,lots of splinters, would be very hard for kids to work with"
3,IT'S A KIT??????,"The price was right, and when I got it I found out why. It's a kit that you have to put together and paint! I would have given it only 1 star, but I am a crafter and will put it together and give it to my granddaughter. It's probably my own fault, I am sure it said somewhere in the discription that it was a kit. If it goes together well, I'd most likely buy more of there products. I was just very disapointed when I first got this item."
3,Can't sort but he likes the toys,"I got this for Alan who is 10 months old. He isn't into sorting yet, but did seem to like the different toys, not sure which is his favorite yet."
1,looks ok but way too expensive,paying this much for this toy seems to be pointless to me. all it is is another soft toy with bright colors. i think alot of toy companies and manufacturers need to lower the prices. toys are just getting way out of control price-wise speaking. looks cute though but at least lower it ten or 15 dollars less and you might get more buyers.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"My 6 month old enjoyed this, but he also enjoys plastic cups so that is not saying much. The problem is that nowhere on the package does it say is is BPA free. Also some of the rubbers and plastics have an unfamiliar look and feel to other toys that I trust. So I went to the Small World Toys website to find out more and it has shut down. I got mine in a discount store so this Chinese made company might just be dumping them and spliting. I am taking this back, I don't trust it."
3,Colorful toy,"Our Granddaughter was 1 year old when we purchased this toy. She loves putting items inside the top but it is a little difficult to put the shapes in the sides. Soft, colorful toy but not too exciting a toy to play with for a long period of time. I would probably not purchase another one as a gift for a child."
4,Baby loves this,"My son is about to turn 1 year old, and this has been one of his favorite toys for the last five months or so. He doesn't use it as a shape sorter, but he loves the different pieces. This is a non-electronic toy that has held his interest consistently. I plan to make it one of my standard gifts to babies."
5,Perfect trash cinema!,"Acid eating satan cult, rabies meat pies, freak outs, ample nudity and sex, brutally violent and funny at the same time. One of the greatest trash horror movies ever!"
4,this movie kicked my butt,"i thought this was insane,the pace this film moves at is way faster than some of the other drive in nightmares of the 70s.you could say this film lives up to its cover art,well maybe not but what film in the 60-70s did.the only reason the art today lives up to the film,is they just take a picture of the crew,amp it up on a computer and another crummy modern day poster yuck!!!!!!!!well the extras where ok the interviews etc.i liked the trailer, but the trailers for other films was not my thing.the lost scences from the directors cut where stupid.i like the theatrical cut,forget the directors."
4,MORE THAN MEAT PIE,"this is some very good grindhouse.more than meat pie filler.i found my copy at a flea market with the intent to sell,but decided to view it first.i was very surprised it held my attention,has some good gore-better than the crap they make now adays.i will not be selling this copy."
3,100% Grindhouse Material!!!,"I like this movie because of the gore, and the zombie-like plot! After some Satan worshipping hippies who get high on LSD and cause problems in town, a little boy takes blood from a rabid dog and puts it in meat pies, and gives them to the cult. They start to go crazy by killing people and infecting the town. If you like zombie flicks, gore, LSD, and hippies, then I DRINK YOUR BLOOD!!!"
4,Very interesting,"Good movie Viggo is great. Although the story is not quite to what really happenned, it is really about Jung and his conflicts. It was interesting."
5,Dangerous Method,Michael Fassbender becoming a fast fave. Excellent every time I have seen him. Would probably invest in his next project.
2,Not Dangerous Enough,"This film has great production value under the helm of veteran producer Jeremy Thomas. However after sitting through the whole film, I was not impressed by this ""dangerous method"" suggested by Freud to Jung for treating a Russian woman played by Keira Knightly who ""suffered a bit"" under the dirctorial hands of David Cronenburg. Poor choice, she is no Russian, if you ask me. Viggo Mortensen although not a bit resembles Freud, gave a very impressive performance while the headliner Michael Fassbinder(a good actor in many recent films) walks through the film seeming a bit lost. Under directed by Cronenburg? A cold and unfulfilling film."
1,Dangerously bad acting,Knightly just screams the entire film. Her accent is also pretty crap. I want my $1.99 and one hour and 40 minutes back.
1,Wish I could give it zero stars!,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I have no idea why anyone gave it rave reviews.First, Keira Knightley's performance was simply over the top. Her character didn't seem crazy; it seemed totally freakish and weird. It was as if Knightley was over-exaggerating every word and every action. So much so that it was hard to watch her without wanting to laugh at how ridiculous her acting was.Then, the relationship between Keira Knightley and Michael Fassbender (Carl Jung in the movie) was so bland and boring that you could not even imagine the supposed passion they had for one another. Lastly, every time Jung and Freud (Viggo Mortensen) met, I had to fight not to fall asleep because their conversation was beyond mundane.Definitely don't waste your money or time on this film. You can earn more money but you can never get back the 90 mins you will spend watching this dud."
1,Total waste of time and cost,"This film is tedious and badly acted. In particular, the acting by Ms. Knightley was bad enough to cause one to apply to a mental institution, just to get away from this movie. Further, the audience never really learns the significant differences between Jung and Freud."
3,where are the sex scenes when you need em?,Keira Knightley is a hot chick no doubt but she plays her charecter here very poorly. i think you can call it bad acting..... this movie could actually use a good long sex scene....all and all not too boring......the subject of freud and jung deserves more than 140 min of cinema it deserves a mini tv series the least.....
4,excellent acting,and a very interesting story..based on history which is the kind of movie i like.the actors are terrific also.
4,Intriguing,"I'd recommend this film for its source material, rather than as a movie per se. It tells a great story about some extraordinary people, and leaves one with a desire to find out more about them, (and in particular Jung) so for anyone interested in psychoanalysis, it's a must-see."
3,Dueling Psychiatrists!,"I watched this movie and I have to admit it was not as I expected. At times this movie was hard to watch as Dr. Jung is interviewing this young woman Sabina who he ultimately falls in love with and has a long term affair. I don't think Keira Knightly was believable in this role and I found her accent to be really forced. I'm just used to seeing her in other roles, I guess, and it was difficult to watch her--she was trying too hard to portray this woman and for me it didn't work. However I liked Viggo Mortenson in the part of Sigmund Freud--I wouldn't have recognized him and I feel that he pulled it off well. The positive aspect of watching this film was that it made me want to know more about the characters involved, especially Carl Jung."
3,Mostly good performances; story ending seems abrupt,"I will not comment on how much of this is historically accurate since I do not know the facts. Otherwise, the performances are mostly very good, though Knightley is a bit irritating at times, overdoing the grimaces and the odd accent. Fassbender and Mortensen are very solid by contrast.Somehow, this film left me wanting a bit more. Did Jung have any sort of relationship with his kids? Why did his wife stay with him? Surely she knew he was getting around with the other women and patients. How did Sabina's childhood abuse lead to the screaming fits and attacks that she suffered? How many other patients benefited, or didn't, at the clinic?"
5,Interesting!,"I would especially recommend this movie for people who are into this subject. If you have some background, I'm guessing you'll find it even more enjoyable. But for a neophyte like me, it's a good way to see the history behind it. This film made me want to know more about this field! Besides, there's Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen, and Michael Fassbender with great performances, as usual."
3,Good,Viggo is excellent in every movie he is in. Keira Knightly overacts a great deal. Overall the movie is slow.
2,wanted to like it but didn't,"i wanted to like the movie because of the stars (although more the guys than the girl). but found it slow, stilted and uninteresting. it's too bad..."
3,A Dangerous Method,"For his third collaboration with director David Cronenberg, Viggo Mortensen took on the role of famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, playing opposite Michael Fassbender as his younger colleague Carl Jung and Keira Knightley as Sabina Spielrein, the woman who came between them. With that kind of pedigree and its provocative subject matter, A Dangerous Method picked up some early awards buzz that unfortunately burned off by the time the Oscars came around, though Mortensen did pick up a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Golden Globes. The performances from its distinguished three leads are amazing. If historical drama and psychosexual tension are your thing, this one's definitely worth a look."
2,History is changed,This is an example of Hollywood revriting history. Are people so ignorant? All they need is provvide good looking actors.
3,So much potential,This movie is ok and kind of gets lost in itself. It had the potential to be sexy but it is not. The relationships are not well developed and the characters are not that appealing.
1,Unsexy,"The most unsexy sex I've seen since a comedy involving falling on a bannana peel and knocking over lamps. With all the Victorian layers of clothing and sexual repression, what fun this movie could have had slowly peeling away the layers. Instead we get the opposite of eroticism- sudden shots to the middle of a sex scene that could not possibly be less erotic. Middles are never good- show us the beginning. There's no foreplay. It's ironic because the rest of the movie is so slow that when slowness is needed, it's fast! In addtion, there is bad acting all around. Keira especially overacts so much i couldnt bear it. Everones accent is wrong. Dialogue slow. False Embellishments to the real story of freud vs jung. Also .Not a single redeeming feature. Cant' believe i paid 13 bucks for that!"
2,Cures Insomnia,"I love the actors - but this film was short of keeping me awake. The plot creeps up on your like a shadow and it is slow in getting to the point. Keira Knightly is beautiful, but I am sure she will find other scripts to delight her mind and talent. As for the portrayal of Freund and Jung, the casting was superb. If you choose to see this film, and you can manage to keep your eyelids apart for moments at a time, you can find the actors' craft quite remarkable. I gave this film 2 stars for the casting quality only."
1,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the movie itself alot as I am into psychology, but the quality of the movie...notsomuch! I streamed the movie and it kept jumping back to the beginning or freezing up the entire time. It ended taking me almost four hours to watch the whole thing piece by piece. I intend to rent or purchase the movie and watch again in the very near future without interruption. This was my first time streaming a movie from Amazon and I was less than pleased and will most likely not do it again...fail!!!"
5,Not for everyone,"Very interesting picture about the relationship between Freud and Jung.The debate is still on if Jung became a quack. Any Freudian would say he did, but there may be people out there that had successful treatment with Jung's methods so it is hard for a layman like me to make the call.As much as Cronenberg intended to make this movie as universal as possible, I suspect that you may only enjoy this one if you have some basic knowledge about Freud, Jung, maybe Wagner and psychoanalysis in general. Then you will really have a great time.I highly recommend listening to Cronenberg's comments on the DVD. He gave tremendous insight to the story, adding very relevant information to the scenes. He sounded like a true scholar."
4,Well done.,"A young woman with mental health issues comes under the care of Dr. Jung, a psychiatrist and a friend of Sigmund Freud. Dr. Jung is married, but has an affair with his new patient. The affair becomes public, damaging the doctor's reputation. The woman eventually becomes a mental health practitioner in her own right. This one was interesting, with a look at how a doctor can put his family life and professional reputation in peril by engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a patient. The film is well paced, and the acting is solid. If you are seeking a movie that is not the usual holiday fluff, this is a good one to check out."
2,sum of the parts is greater than the whole,"I like all of the actors in this movie in other things that I have viewed, but hated this film.The characters were exaggerated and farcical reproductions of people. I found it impossible to relate to or sympathize with them. It was surprising how unlikeable they all were. I keep waiting for some redeeming scene or quality to emerge and was disappointed."
4,"A ""niche"" film","I think this might not appeal to a ""mainstream"" audience, especially if you compare it to the ""usual"" dreck one sees in movie trailers in the US in recent years (nothing but over-the-top special effects and gratuitous violence, with this-could-never-happen plots). As a psychologist, I had a special interest in the characters, and therefore enjoyed it very much."
2,jung vs freud,the movie follows the development of freud and jung's relationship over a decade. the movie nicely depicts the narcissism of freud and his difficulty tolerating anyone who was not an avid admirer or who challenged his beliefs. unfortunately freud served as model for the development of psychoanalysis. jung challenged freud and was excommunicated from freud's church. keira knightly plays a patient of jung's who he stops therapy with and then beds...somewhat similarly to freud bedding his sister-in-law in terms of boundary violations. a dangerous method is a good name for remnants of psychoanalysis still in existence.
1,missed oppertunity,The subject at hand was one with great potential.Unfortunately the great two masters were dealt with in an extremely superficial matter..And on the other hand Keira Kneightly over acted every scene. leaving nothing to be internalized.If you want to watch a movie about the human psychosis watch any of Lars Von trier's
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed that it was a library cd. It still had all the library information. When I finish I like to give to my library but felt I could not do so.
5,another good westlake,i love all of westlake's books. i think he's so funny. his characters are so interesting and bizarre. i look forward to reading another westlake book.
3,Not the best...,"It fits, it's comfortable, and it's good for working out. One problem: it doesn't respond very well to normal wear and tear. In fact, just after a week, threads started to unravel."
3,hmmm...,"I don't like this album too much but I'll still give it three stars, because it's fairly good for what it is. It's a cross between rap and NY toughguy style hardcore.It might be possible to sound a little whiter while ""rapping"" than these guys, but it'd be tough. Seriously, they'd give crazytown a run for their money in the whitest sounding rapping competition. The lyrics are also really bad. Apparently the singer cries ""tears of blood."" Poor guy. I guess the lyrics are a little better than their earlier race war lyrics on the demos (which they claim were about hardcore brotherhood or something).Still you can't knock this too much because it's still way better than the mainstream raprock that it helped spawn. Probably, If they had not attempted to ""rap"" this would be a pretty high quality hardcore album. So If you like that, you'll probably like this. If you like raprock, you'll love it."
2,What's the big deal?,"I couldn't believe it when I saw this album had five stars from so many people. Do they realize that people might actually go out and pay money for this based on their reviews? There is a basis to my two star rating. I got the cd knowing the band just by their name with other cds. I put it in first and it seemed alright, then they started ""singing."" I'll give credit where credit is due, but this guy can't even rap well. His weak voice and sad attempts at rapping produce preachy lyrics that no one should be subjected to. To me lyrics mean little, the music is the reason it got two stars instead of one, but the lyrics are still there ruining the music. I would advise people interrested in this album to check out the samples or download some songs before making the commitment of buying it, since some people did like it."
2,Someone please gives these guys a hug.,"I shouldn't be judging music that I know little about, but jesus, this is probably the worst album in my collection. When I was about 13 I read up about Biohazard and how they have tough lives on the streets and all that jazz, so I thought I'd buy their record to hear what the hood sounds like to angry white men. I'm sorry, but maybe they should spend a few more years on the streets and buy some decent drugs while they're at it. I'm into all types of music, even alot of heavy stuff, believe it or not, but Biohazard to me just sucks. The lyrics are awful, the instrumentation is actaully decent, but the whole sound is just anger. It annoys me that these guys don't seem to feel any other emotion than that, and that's why I give this album a 2."
4,Shoulda ordered the King size,"Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a fine product, but I measured my down pillows before ordering and determined that one only needed the Queen size (as the King were more expensive). The pillow had to be bunched up inside this protector and that is not what I wanted."
2,I didn't really like it,"I love death metal, and some of Deicide's albums, but I can't really get into this one, not that it [stinks], but I just don't like it."
2,technical but boring,"This album is fast, brutal, has excellent recording, precise guitar riffs, and perfect drumming. The only drawback however, and it is a HUGE one, is that there is hardly a good song in sight.Decide's first record was very promising. The songs were great. It had mezmerizing, chanting, sing-along-with-satan, kind of tunes. The songs on Legion, and most of their records since then however, are just boring. You know those heavy records that are just boring, repetive walls of sound? Well throw Legion into that category.Here's some advice to the band - nobody cares how technical or fast your riffs are if the songs aren't good. I highly recommend buying their self-title first CD instead. Despite inferior recording quality the songs are MUCH better."
1,Redundant.,I love metal but this album is the same one benton already made twice before and is still making now....even the generic riffs are the same!!!! LAME
5,So good it made satan go pipi!! From joy!!,"Seriously, just listen to cacademon(joke intended!) Great listening if you wanna scare some people into a seizure, play it for someone you hate, preferebly!"
1,Ridiculous,"Poor musicianship, uncomplicated riffs and boring drumz make for a death metal release that is mediocre at best. Get suffocation, cryptopsy or hypocrisy instead of this"
2,Not their best....their worst,"Deicide is one of my favorite bands, but I never listen to this CD. It just isn't very good. I think they tried too hard to be brutal and forgot to be good. Poor arrangements. Chaotic. Sounds very rushed. If your looking to get into Deicide, buy anything other than this. My fav's in order: Deicide, Serpents, Insin, Once, Legion."
1,Only for the lucky,"The unit I got was DOA: the tray would not open. Marantz tech support cannot be reached by phone. So, though the seller offered to replace the defective unit with a new one, I had no confidence that even a unit that functioned normally at first would be repairable in future.Nearly all reviews of the Marantz CD5001, from every source, rave about the model. But after this experience I will look for a comparable solution from a different manufacturer."
4,may not be easy to swallow,"These vitamins are great ! they're organic, easy to digest and have great reviews everywhere. However, I can't figure out how to swallow these without them getting stuck or coughing like crazy. I have no problems taking large vitamins but only if they're gel or vcaps. These are average sized multivitamin pills but solid and rock hard. Just something to consider if you're used to gel or vcap pills."
4,Uh oh,"Would've given 5 stars based on looks, ease of assembly, and quality...that is, until the rear tire popped the third time my daughter rode it. Now I have to go out and find a new tire...this was a birthday present and rather disappointing for her."
5,Nice Bike,This is probably the best buy I have ever made for my grandson. He just turned 4 this month & there are still 2 adjustments to move the seat back so he can use it for at least another year if it lasts that long the way he tears stuff up!
3,Kids Trike,"I could not resist buying this trike because it has a neat retro look with real air filled tires and mustache handlebars. It was extremely easy to put together as it came in 3-4 pieces. However, I am an engineer and I really think that this thing could have been built heavier so that would stand the test of time. The chrome fenders are very thin metal and my 19 month old son was pounding on it with a plastic hammer that he received for christmas and now the fenders look like they were in a heavy hail storm, they dented way too easy. However things are not built to last today, my grandparents still have my dads trike and it looks old, but still in great working order. Overall this is the neatest looking trike I have ever seen, I wish that they would have spent a few extra dollars and made it heavy duty enough to last for years."
2,Maybe it works better for older kids,I'm not sure if my daughter is just too small for this trike but she is having such a problem with it. She is now 2 3/4 and her legs reach the pedals fine but its just such a big and heavy trike. It looks cute and it is very safe but the wheel base is so broad and moving it around is work. It may work better for an older child
5,Awesome Lowrider Trike!,"We got this trike for our 2.4 year old daughter. She loves it and zooms around very well. The low sitting position provides a much safer (from my perspective) ride and not top heavy like some other trikes. It is nice metal frame and real rubber, air filled, tires. Could not be happier."
5,Beautiful Trike,"The Shwinn Roadster looks amazing, it is great quality for the price. It is really unbelievable for the amount of money it cost. Everyone that see it says it is so cool looking. My daughter is 22 months old, she has a little trouble reaching the pedals, we purchased the pedal blocks, which helps. This will be a trike that she can use for a long time and should hold up well. The only concern we have is the tubes, which are apparently always on back order, we will keep our fingers crossed that they don't pop."
4,Very Sturdy Tike,"My 2 1/2 year old got this Trike for Christmas and we have been very impressed with it.It is very sturdy with a low center of gravity--I don't worry about it tipping over. The overall quality is terrific--it looks and feels great.I do have to say that even my son who is very active and coordinated--has had a hard time figuring out how to pedal. So I have a hard time thinking that the 18month old age requirement is very realistic. It is, after all, pretty big and heavy. I would think it would be ideal for 3 and up."
5,Blue Trike!,I guess you can call it being at the right place at the right time. I purchased this bicycle in December and it was discounted for more than 1/2 off the msrp with free shipping. Can't beat that! Wrap it up! All the other retailers were quoting the price for Amazon's non discount msrp or more. I read so many glowing reviews on so many sites that I had to get it for my son. It will be his present for his second birthday in a few months. I know he will love it and can't wait for him to ride it.
4,Fine trike,This seems like a good quality trike. My daughter (21 months)is too small to reach the pedals so i taped some blocks around them. The bell on the handlebars is a nice option.
4,Solid Build,"Schwinn does it right with this Trike! It is all metal and easy to put together. Yet, the build is superior with nice touches and finishes such as the chrome and streamers. You will not regret this purchase."
3,Classic!,My younger daughter road for 2 years now gave to neighbers kids and they ran in for another 3 years!
2,What happened to Schwinn's quality?,"We recieved this red Schwinn Roadster in a timely manner. However, in putting this together we noticed a number of flaws... more than just imperfections. The decals are all very noticeably off center. The left wheel appears to be angled/inverted. Also, we've even already noticed gross paint flaws. Sadly, I also have serious doubts about the durability of the untreated wood on the back. What I do like about this is that it was very easy to put together and will grow with our son. If he had not yet seen this, however, I would glady send it back for something of better quality. I would not reccomend this to a friend."
3,"Item fine once purchased elsewhere, seller horrible.","The Roadster itself is great, when delivered with all required parts. This purchase was a big mistake due to the seller.... came without two integral parts for the bike's assembly. We bought this ""used"" but what I think it really meant was never used, just missing parts. Had to return back to Amazon, and couldn't do an exchange. Repurchased the bike as ""new"" and was very pleased. Daughter loves the bike. Easy to assemble. Just make sure you aren't buying from the Amazon Warehouse.... buy new. It's worth it!"
1,VERY Poor Quality,"I read a bunch of reviews where people complained about the quality of the bike, but it looked so nice on the picture...When I received it, I wish I trusted those reviews. It's very cheaply made. One tire was already patched with some glue, and all three were deflated. I tried to inflate them and noticed that one back tire was not even sitting on the rim and I could not do anything to fix it. The ornament on the bike is actually not painted but rather slapped on with a sticky painted tape. At first I thought it was a protective film over the paint, but NO, it was the ""paint"". I am returning the bike!!"
1,NOT MADE IN THE USA,When conducting an internet search for an American made Tricycle this one is advertised as American Made. When it arrived the box is marked designed in the USA and made in China. If you are looking for an tricycle manufactured in the USA this one is not despite the claims posted all over the internet.
2,The 5-year old rides the 2-year old's bike,"I loved the look of this trike and got it last Christmas 2010 for my 2-year-old. A year later she still cannot reach the pedals. She sits on it and scoots around sometimes. While it looks awesome and is well constructed, it is just too big and heavy. My five-year-old can pedal the tricycle, but of course she would rather ride her bike or scooter. I would NOT buy this again. I wish I had seen it in person and would never have bought it. My daughter is in the 90th percentile for height and weight for a girl her age."
4,Adorable and Sturdy!!!! Perfect for a Princess :),"This bike is absolutely adorable! It was the hit at my daughters 3rd birthday party and EVERYBODY was dying to know where I got it! Shes such a tiny little thing so it's been nearly impossible to find a trike that fits her; to my surprise this bike was an absolutely perfect fit! And I love that it's adjustable so she has plenty of room to grow on it. :)The only 2 complaints I have are:1. It's a very heavy bike for my peanut, so she can't make it move completely on her own yet. However her cousin who is 7 months younger but twice her size can peddle it fairly easily. So I really think it depends on the size/weight of your child.2. I was a little bummed to see that the detail on the bike isn't painted on it's actually stickers. Yes, this is very nit-picky however, as soon as my 3 year old figured this out she started to pick at them!Other than that, I am very happy with the overall quality of this bike :)"
3,Lynda,"My Grand daughter loves this tricycle, it was for her birthday. Our problem was that the rear right tire was warped, and the handle bar will-not stay tight. We constantly have to tighten it up, and the tire looks wobbly."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"My son loved the bike. It was easy for him to ride. Not as well made as one would expect from Schwinn. The seat and pedals needed replacement twice, and now need them again. We also had the fork on the front snap in two. Think twice before purchasing this bike."
4,23 month old loved this shiny new red bike,"My parents purchased this bike for my 23 month old son for an early 2 year old birthday gift. My son is a bit tall for his age (90th %tile) and he fits it perfectly with the seat forward. My only flaw with this bike is that it came with a crack in the wooden board which has the Schwinn name written on it. My father put the bike together and said that the screw/bolt was drawn too tight and cracked the wood. This part was already assembled when shipped to us. My son learned how to peddle in three days and is doing well on steering after a couple of weeks. He loved the tassles on the handlebars, and called it a motorcycle when we pulled the blanket off to reveal the surprise. The tires need inflated a bit, but the bike does not tip and is safe on our slightly inclined driveway. I would definately recommend this bike as a beginner tricycle for a two year old and up."
5,Twin Trikes,"These trikes were very easy to assemble. They truly are nice quality. We purchased these for our twin grandaughters 2nd birhtday. They were a big hit with the kids and adults. We are still teaching them to pedal and steer, but they will have along time to practice. The seat is adjustable to grow with them. We liked that they were low to the ground, somewhat like a cross between a tricycle and big wheel, so as they learn they are not likely to tip over. All in all, great product, great price, great quality."
5,classic fun,"We already have one of these for our 2 year-old daughter and when our son was born we knew that our daughter was NOT going to want to share hers so, we purchased one for him. This trike is very stable! And, It's solidly built. The classic style makes this is a toy that we will save so that our children can pass it down to their kids! We love it! But more importantly, our kids LOVE this trike!"
4,Very Impressive,"Its a great little tricycle and well built. The only hang up is the top steering tube which doesn't have any bearings in it. There is a lot of ""slop"". After I put it together, I never noticed the slop. My 1.5 year old doesn't notice the slop either.I had to take off a few of the decals because whoever slapped em on there in the factory left some folds for an unprofessional look. I ordered it from Wally world for less than Amazon."
5,Great purchase,Very attractive and well made! My 3 year old Grandaughter loved it. It was easy to put together and the delivery was fast. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a unique gift.
4,our 3 year old loves it!,"Got this for our 3-year old son for Christmas. He saw it and was so excited! It's a shiny blue color and is just really cool. Grandparents saw it and thought it was cool, too."
4,I want to ride my bicycle,The bike is very cool and the little Sophia loved it since the first ride!Amazon was excellent delivering the toy and the bike is very well made. Assembling it is not hard and it was fun. Your little child with that bike will be like a cowboy on his horse!
5,This tricycle is fantastic!,"This tricycle is so nice! It looks great, is very sturdy and was so easy to put together. It wasn't that expensive (I paid [...]) and it is by far the nicest one I found! The seat is adjustable to fit different length legs and my son is 36"" tall and he fits it perfectly with room to grow! I would definitly encourage you to get this trike!"
3,The good and the bad,"Well we got this bike for our 2 1/4 year old daughter. It wound up being too big for her but I'm sure when she's older that she'll enjoy it. Installation was very easy, took less than 30 minutes.Unfortunately the front tire tube was defective on delivery and would deflate minutes after inflation. We called Schwinn and asked for a replacement front part of the bicycle (it comes with the front of the bike assembled in the box) and they sent us just a bicycle tube. I didn't want to go through the hassle of changing the tire tube on a brand new bike so I called again and they sent the entire front tire. I finally just bit the bullet and removed the old tire and replaced it with the new one and it's working fine now. Just have to wait till my daughter is big enough for it."
2,it an average toy,I thought Schwinn it an good quality brand but I was wrong on this one. There are two things about this product I don't like. First of all this one made in china so the part didn't fit in together as well as it should (safety concern) both of the nuts that hold the back wheel together it only go halfway in. Second of all the two rear fenders are rusted if it came in contact with water.
5,well worth the money,"Bought this for my grand daughter because some other kids had some and she was always riding theirs. Kids love this because it is fun, just like a big wheel but built better."
5,Schwinn roadster trike,"We purchased this trike for our son's second birthday and he couldn't be more thrilled. He loved everything about it including the 'old school' wooden step along the back wheels. It is durable, well made and fun for our little guy. The style of this particular trike also allows for growth of the child and can last for a few years if care is given."
4,shwinn trike,"When we received the trike, we discovered the bell was broken. So we are in the process of ordering another one for our sons' bike. Overall, the trike was in excellent condition and my son lovessss riding it. He is three and a half and it is perfect for him. I definitely recommend this trike :o)"
5,Love it!!!,Love this trike! Perfect for my 2 1/2 year old son. He can't pedal yet but he will learn. He can reach pedals. He loves to scoot on it. I think the grandparents love it more than my son! They went on & on how great it looks! Very pleased!
4,great trike for kids and it grows with them.,"the trike is a great first for my 2 year old son.everything arrived in perfect order with the exception of a small dent in one of the rear fenders due to the factory packaging. slightly noticeable, but doesn't affect the function at all.My son loves the trike and has been speeding around the house all day. even my six year old was trying it out (we had to move the seat all the way back for her, but it is real easy to adjust the seat with just a simple knob that unscrews the bolt and you slide the seat to the desired position.the bike is very well built from tube steel and the only plastic on the bike is the seat. I will be buying another in pink for my newborn when she is old enough to ride."
3,Holes in inner tubes! Very disappointed!,"This may be a great bike -- but I don't know yet and may not know for awhile. Today was my grandson's 2nd birthday and out of the box came a brand new beautiful red tricycle. We inflated the tires and wanted him to take his first ride but unfortunately, the rear tires were leaking! Called the 800 number and was informed that the inner tubes are on back order and they don't know when they will come in. Made in China -- I guess we shouldn't be surprised. I used to think Schwinn was a quality name. Saw someone else here at Amazon had the same problem. Think Schwinn might wise up and pack a spare or two in the box - because, besides Schwinn, I don't know who else carries a 10x2 inner tube. We called a number of bike stores today and they said, 'no, special order.' Beware when buying -- have a patch kit or two handy!"
3,from a grandmother's view,"I ordered this trike for my 2 grandchildren, ages 2 and 4. The bike was easy to assemble, and very safe and sturdy. I searched around to find this bike in stores so I could see its size and weight, but couldn't find it anywhere in my area. My only complaint about the bike is its size and weight. It is bigger than I imagined and very heavy to carry or lift anywhere. I live on a hill and very often have to push or carry the trike up the hill."
3,Missing Parts on Arrival from Amazon,"We bought this trike from Amazon and when I tried to assemble it for my daughter on Christmas morning, it was missing both the bolt that connects the seat to the frame, and the clamp that fastens the handlebars and fork to the frame. There were no assembly instructions or warranty information in the box, so we'll see how the Pacific Cycle support number works out... during business hours M-F.Aside from it being totally unusable, it's very nice-looking and appears to be otherwise well made. Inflatable rubber tires are much nicer and smoother than solid tires. My daughter is 3 1/2 and about 40 inches tall, and the middle seat adjustment (using a carriage bolt from Home Depot) is slightly too far back, so I agree with all the other reviewers who said 38"" is in no way the maximum height."
5,Great Trike,"I got 8 of these when the price was low and they were a big hit last night with all the kids. It is a little bit big for a 2 year old but my nephews who are 4 and 5 fit perfectly on them. As for the quality they seem good but I am going to use car polish on them to make sure they have a little protection from the elements, also buying a grill cover for added protection. I find they make great bike covers. Out of the 3 colors, I really like the blue, its a real good paint job, can't wait to see what it looks like after I polish it up. Great gift for any little kid."
4,Terrific First Trike!!,"Great first trike for your little one! Few unexpected quality issues...seat is plastic (cheap), wooden deck appears to be ""untreated"" raw wood!! I would consider shellacking to increase longevity not to mention improving the overall appearance of this wonderful trike. Also, please note that your bike will arrive without the caps on the valve stems as they present a choking hazard (just a note) and the stickers on fenders are purple not pink like the bike. This doesn't come across very well in any of the online pics. No big deal (my daughter loves pink and purple) and the trike is still cute as can be! Purchased for a tall almost 4 year old girl and she loves it. Not quite as large as I expected so you may want to buy this for age 1-3 only (average sized children only!)"
4,Missing a part but my daugter still loves it,"We got this trike for our daughter for Christmas. We carefully assembled it but realized there is a part missing where the handlebar frame connects to the wheel. It was Christmas so we weren't going to take it away from her and send it back. It still works but has a wobbly connection because of the missing part. But our almost four year old doesn't notice and loves it. It is well made other than that although the pink on the tire guards are different than the pink frame, but again, our little girl doesn't care so neither do we."
4,stylish ride,this one is really looking great.my 22 months old son loves this cycle.he likes the cycle very much.he is trying to pedel and he reaches it easily.package came at time without any delay.we like the rubber tire.overall it is a perfect trike and i recommend this to every one who is planning to buy a trike in future.
4,"Review from Rachel, age 2.75","I love my bike. It is fun to ride. I had trouble pedaling at first, but I am stronger now. It sometimes tips over when I take a turn too fast, but I am just learning."
5,cool trike,"We got this trike for our grandson for Christmas. I put it together myself, so you know that it was easy. It has a classy look and the seat is adjustable, so it will last him a long time before his legs are too long. He loves it, so that says it all!"
5,Awesome tricycle!,"OMG my daughter is the talk of the neighborhood riding this sweet trike. ""Gee willikers, they don't make things like they used to"" does NOT apply to this puppy! My daughter just turned 2, and it's a smidgen small for her but she will be pedaling like a pro in no time (yes, that's right-a professional tricylist.. because naturally such a thing exists.) And the seat is adjustable. The back platform is pretty nifty too.. she puts her dolls on it and takes them for a spin. Sweeeet looks + kiddie exercise + toddler-tested durability = Get ya one!"
4,Product Customer Service Disappointing,"Upon putting this product together I found that there was excessive play on the front fork assembly. I took it apart and re-checked the assembly directions, reassembled with the same results. I contact Schwinn support concerning the problem and was informed that I had received an older model and they would send a retro fit part to correct the problem. They stated I would receive the part in 7 to 10 business days. Well it has been over a month now and no part has been received. My granddaughter loves the bike even though the front wobbles when she rides it. I would recommend this bike only if amazon ships one of the newer models without the defective front fork assembly."
5,Awesome,"We got this trike for Grandaughter for Christmas. It is so cool. Lots of room for growing and changing . Kind of a unique trike, something that really wows people. Got it in pink..."
5,Great buy!,We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old son. It is a quality made product. Very sharp looking. He is of average height and he can't quite reach the pedals yet. But he just pushes himself with his feet on the floor. He has had a lot of fun on it. We would buy it again.
5,The Blue is Awesome too!!!,"I fell in love with this trike when I saw one at the park. I researched it and found it came in three colors, Pink, Red, and Blue. The pink has had horrible quality reviews, so I avoided it, but it was my original choice. The Red has had really good reviews, but I found hardly anything on the blue. So I decided to gamble on the blue, where this was for my girls. and it arrived in outstanding condition, no rust or dents, it's assembly is amazingly simple, a screwdriver, and a crescent wrench, five minutes later the kids are arguing over it! So I think I'll have to buy another!"
5,Wonderful trike!!!,Absolutely terrific trike. Always had the standard Radio Flyer or other little red trike that easily tipped over with the child as they were turning. This has a wider wheel base and a lower adjustable seat that sits further back.The Schwinn is a bit heavier than the others and very sturdy. Our Granddaughter got it from Santa and turned 3 in January....took her about two days to learn how to pedal. My husband said it was easy to put together...a good thing because we bought another one to keep at our house. The rubber tires help with traction on the carpet and outside and the chrome fenders add a little flair.It is a really pretty shade of pink. Unlike the plastic trikes it requires the minimum care of keeping it out of the rain.Hoped it would be of the same high quality as the 2 wheeler Schwinn bike I had as a girl in the 1950's and was not disappointed.
5,SchWINN WIN!,"Perfect Present for a kid! SUPERB quality, easy to assemble and so much fun! This is a bike that will stay in the family and will be handed down to my grandkids! We got an awesome deal; $35 and free shipping!!!!WINNER! Honestly though, if I had to pay regular price for it, it would be worth it!"
5,Quality Bar None,"This is the kind of product that is harder and harder to find. Metal and wood and plastic used in the right proportion to make an affordable, safe and long lasting product. I would recommend this Trike to anyone who is looking for a well made product that will last many hand-me-downs."
4,Great Trike,"Pros: Great trike for kids. We like the fact that it is ""low profile"" and is not easily tipped over. The assembly was very easy and the quality is top notch. The adjustable seat is very useful. Our son loves the bell as well. He should be able to ride this trike till he is at least five. Good quality tires.Fast, prompt shippingCons: We ordered the blue trike yet received the red trike."
2,"Way, way WAY...did I say ""way""?...too heavy.","What else can I say? My 3 year old son is big...has been in the 95th percentile for height and weight since birth. He's never been able to ride this thing comfortably. This is my first review on Amazon and I'm doing it because I feel strongly about this item. Out of the box it's beautiful...it could not look any cooler and my son was jumping up and down. You want it to be as fun as it looks but the reality is that it's just way too heavy. Not fun, never used. End of story."
4,Love This Trike,"OMG, this trike is too cute! It's very low to the ground with a wide wheel base so there's no chance of tipping it over. My daughter is small for her age but can reach the pedals with the seat pushed forward all the way. She does look like she's riding a Harley because the handle bars are up so high. I haven't tinkered around with it much so I don't know if the handle bars adjust up and down.A great value for the money and so much cuter than anything Kettler or Radio Flyer has to offer."
5,Perfect for a 3 year old!,"This bike is beautiful, well made, and well loved by my son who just turned 3. I had to write a review to combat another review that states that there is a height restriction of 38"". The box does have a height chart on it that says Ages 2 to 4, 26"" to 38"". Since my son is 38"" tall and just reaches the pedals on the seat setting closest to the wheel, I emailed the company to let them know of the problem and this is what they wrote back:""Thank you for contacting us. The minimum height and age recommendation for the Schwinn Roadster is 3 yrs, 38"" and up. I will be sure to have the boxes looked at to verify what they say.""Yes, apparently they've made a pretty big mistake on the box, but the fact that the minimum is 38"" makes total sense. I hope this helps."
3,safe but way too heavy for small children,"Good looking trike but I'm taking this back to toysrus because my 2.5 year old son cannot get the thing up to speed due to its weight. He's a really strong sort of kid too, just bad design if you ask me. but I have to give it points for making it down three concrete steps w/out my son getting hurt.Just want to say, had the store had a display unit there is no way I would have bought it. I was thinking of something really fun for my son like a big wheel... This is for beach cruising and not going fast and spinning out. I live in Seattle with hills and there's no way to get this thing going on the even slight uphill sidewalks. We'll be getting the Radio Flyer Big Flyer instead."
5,kids favorite toy,"My nephew has this trike. Whenever we get together my 2 year old fights for this trike. So for xmas he received his own trike and was so excited. It's a great trike that is easy to pedal. Another little person can stand on the back of it, so more the merrier. Shouldve purchased this for my first child instead of my third."
4,cool trike,directions a bit unclear; there are 2 plastic caps attached to the part that attaches in the front wheel / handle bar section... take those caps off. A little stiff at 1st. ADORABLE!!!
5,The Pink Trike,"I ordered two pink trikes for my granddaughters, their birthdays are 21 days apart. They love them!! I could not beleive the shipping time for these trikes, I think we had them within 48 hours after we ordered them. Nothing but good things to say about this order and the products."
1,Impossible to Replace Rear Tire Inner Tubes!,"Overall, I love this tricycle for my daughter.But, we have encountered one major problem that is making me rethink this purchase. My daughter rode the bike for a bout a week when we got a flat in the rear tire, where the brass vavle stem meets the inner tube. I have been trying to find a replacement inner tube for the rear tire for the past month. The 10x2 inner tube is almost impossible to find, and the one or two places that might have them want more than $20 each!I was originally going to get two more of these for my younger twin daughters next year, but until I work out this tire problem, that's not going to happen!"
2,3 flat tires,I received this trike with 3 flat tires. The 12 inch tire tube needed to be replaced. The valve in the other two tires were defective and had to be replaced.
1,Great Name - Huge dissapointment,"I got this bike for my grandson, because I believed in the Schwinn name. It is beautiful to look at but all the tires were flat when it arrived in the box(some assembly required). I figured that they were shipped flat on purpose and pumped them up on Christmas eve. Christmas morning the big tire was flat again, I pumped it up again but before he could ride around the Christmas tree it was flat again!!! Ever try to get a patch kit, or a tube, or customer service on Christmas Day HA HA HA! Fortunately he had other things to play with but here it is mid january and he still can't ride it!!!"
1,Rear Wheels Won't Spin,"I purchased 2 of these for my almost 3 year old twins. One of them works perfectly and my first girl loves it. But the other one does not work. The rear wheels don't spin and the poor girl was trying and trying to pedal, but couldn't. My big clue was when I put her on a hill and the thing wouldn't even roll downhill! I turned both trikes over and tested the wheels spinning in the air. One set of rear wheels would spin 6 revolutions but the other set of rear wheels would only spin 3 inches. Now one twin thinks she is just no good at the tricycle and can't understand why her sister rides hers around with no problem. I am writing to Amazon to see if I can return or replace the defective one.Jennifer"
1,Price a bit high ???,Wondering why the price is so high on these when target and walmart are selling them for $69.99. why does the maker have the prices so high ...
5,baby's bike!!,We bought this bike for our baby who has Spina Bifida. The bike is so sturdy and stable that the baby sat in it for an hour. She loves it. It will help to exercise her weakened legs.!The price was perfect!
4,good for my chubby preschooler,nice little trike for my daughter. Shes too chubby to ride the bike i got her so this is a perfect fit.
1,Rusty Chrome & Flat Tires,"The chrome fenders were rusted right out of the box. All tires were flat. I read reviews before buying, so I knew to check the rubber strips between the rims and the tubes. They were in there, but not centered properly over the spoke ends. Didn't seem to be any damage to the tubes though. Probably because they were never inflated or ridden on.While inflating, I noticed the rear tires did not fit the rims properly. It's as if the tires are too large in diameter for the rims. It's nearly impossible to properly seat the tire beads on the rim because of this. If you're not careful, the tube will pop out from between the tire and the rim when you pump it up."
4,A 'big-boy' look with a tricycle feel.,"I bought this for my (almost) 3 year old. He has two older brothers who have bicycles, and he thought a regular tricycle was for 'babies.' This one was perfect! He calls it his motorcycle. It was very easy to put together, and since the seat can change position as he grows, I imagine he will be having loads of fun for many years to come!"
4,Schwinn Roadster,"Purchased this for my 2 1/2-year old grandson. I really wanted the blue one vs. ordinary red. His first response was ""wow!"" He can ride backward and forward and really seems to like it. The size is just right for him and hopefully will fit him for a couple of years."
4,Grandma from Texas,I bought 2 of these bikes for my grand daughters ages 2 and 5. They LOVED them! The seat is adjustable so fits the 5 year old or the 2 year old. The detailing and over all construction were very impressive. I was pleasantly surprised with these cute bikes. I would recommend them to anyone.
4,hip trike,Very hip trike. It has a low center of gravity which is great for my 2 year old twins who are just learning to peddle. Given the size this trike will last for years to come. Only complaint would be that it's fairly heavy.
3,Great bike....but too heavy,"I bought this bike for my 2 year old son. The bike is well built, but way too heavy for a toddler age 2-3. Also it does tilt over when you are trying to turn. Take caution when deciding to buy. Think less about you and more of your child ability to handle the weight of this trike."
1,buyer beware!,"This is a really nice trike and my son loves it, but BEWARE of purchasing this item from Amazon! The tricycle I received had obviously been returned because the box had tons of tape on it. Not surprising that the tricycle has a defect that makes it unrideable. Hopefully at my local bike shop I can find a replacement front tire (tire's too big for the wheel and thus won't inflate properly).....or the same tricycle without the defect. Either way I'm out at least the cost of shipping it back to Amazon."
2,Toddler Bike,"I like the bike, however the package came beat up and the bike was damaged. The paint is scratched and the back fender was really dented. Normally I would let these things go, but it was really dented and I haven't heard back from anyone on the matter as to how to handle."
5,So cute!,"We ordered this trike for our son's 2nd birthday. It is sooo cute! It really looks expensive and we love the ""retro"" look of it. The best feature is how low to the ground it is, and the wide wheel base that makes tipping over almost impossible. Our son's legs are still a little short to actually push the pedals (he can reach them though) but we think he'll get it by the summer. He loves the bell and enjoys just pushing himself along the sidewalk. It's very sturdy and a great buy!"
5,"Schwinn Pink Roadster 12""",This trike is well made. Any little girl would be proud to be the owner of this sturdy but girly trike. When my husband and I took it out of the box to assemble (assembly very simple) we were amazed at the quality of the product. Very worthwhile for the price.
2,MP3 Defective,The last two seconds of nearly every song file is corrupt. Sounds like the CD skipping. Very annoying. You might consider buying the CD and ripping your own mp3 files.
4,Gay and Grave,"The film that put New Wave director Agnes Varda on the map, CLEO FROM 5 TO 7 looks spiffy here, as expected from a Criterion transfer. Fresh and jazzy, CLEO follows its heroine as she waits the titular 2 hours for the results of a test from cancer. Sounds grim, but in Varda's hands, CLEO's magical. The sort of movie where actor improvisation really delivers the goods, with an off-the-cuff charm that's very appealing. Wonderful cinematography, as the heroine races around Paris, and a charmingly grave romantic conclusion that's very satisfying. A good introduction to Varda's work."
4,a film which hits home for me,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. As a cancer survivor, I feel for the woman in this movie.This film occurs in almost real-time like the TV series 24. The 90 minute film covers the events between 5 and 7 PM as a woman awaits the results of a biopsy. She goes through town and meets various people. The film has great acting and has a full-color sequence at the beginning of the film when cleo is seeing a Tarot card reader in an attempt to predict what will happen to her. The original French title of the film is ""Cléo de 5 à 7""The Criterion DVD does not have any special features which is rather unusual for a Criterion Collection DVD."
2,"Eh, Seen Better, Seen Worse","Not a whole heck of a lot happens in the 90 minute film in which a woman wanders through the streets of Paris as she anxiously awaits a medical appointment at which she will receive the results of a test. She buys a hat, meets up with a friend, talks a walk in the park etc. The events all unfold in real time and the early 60's mostly black and white cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous but on the whole this one comes across a little too self consciously arty for its own good. Nice, at times, but hardly profound. Perhaps this was more compelling back in 1962.2 1/2 stars."
4,something to consider before joining...,"very good book to be read before anyone even considers joining the reserves within any of the military branches...currently in law enforcement in the Beaufort County area and going to Parris Island on a daily basis to workout I can honestly say that life for a recruit begins on the dreaded ""sand flea/gnat"" infested island in SOUTH CAROLINA, not NORTH CAROLINA...as stated in the previous review...I guess 13 weeks of boot camp made the last reviewer forget what state he/she was in..."
4,Excellent tea at a bargain price,"My wife loved this style of tea. Bought some at Teavana, at a very high price. We're happy with this version, especially for the much better price. Probably not quite the quality as Teavana's, but certainly a fine cup."
2,GREAT MIDDLE,"I found the first 20 pages or so clunky and unclear. But once we get to the story problem, the bus and the killings, it gets really good. Then for about 70 pages it gets better and better. The best is the character development of all these different cops, who each has his own different personality and talents. Also, the police procedural stuff is convincing and compelling. Finally, toward the end, there's about 40 pages that are tedious, like reading an accounting textbook. Then the last few scenes are annoying, at least they were to me. Sorry it wasn't wonderful all the way through."
2,I don't like this acclaimed story,"This is the fourth novel of Martin Beck police mysteries.Although this is acclaimed as one of the best Martin Beck stories, I donft like the novel because it is not a feasible story. I think itfs unlikely to happen that a man kills a woman impulsively to hide his bad behavior and then commits a well-planned mass murder to hide the first crime."
5,The laughing policeman,Simply superb! I cannot wait to read all the Martin Beck series. The only sad note is that the authors won't write anymore...
5,The best mystery story ever written.,This is the best Martin Beck mystery. The plot is simple but intricate. The story is beautifully crafted. The whole thing fits together like jig saw puzzle and the suspense never lets up until the end. The few subplots enhance the main plot. It's perfectly balanced. So many mystery novels seem to come out like a lopsided Christmas tree with too many unrelated decorations. The Laughing Policeman is a pure and perfect work of art.
2,Maybe It's Me..........,but this book just didn't float my boat. I like my books hard-boiled and/or noir and The Laughing Policeman failed on both counts; in fact to be honest I didn't even finish it (after reading over half of it I felt that I at least gave it a chance). Not much is happening here-go figure the critical acclaim!
1,not recommended,"I would not recommend this product. It is not like a pampered chef garlic press. The plunger is too small for the vessel, so the garlic is squeezed up the sides instead of down through the intended holes. And, the second time I used it, the two pieces of the press came apart. I can put them back together, but it is not what I expect in quality. Not worth spending the money to send it back. My daughter took my pampered chef press and I want it back!"
4,Excellent Press,"I don't understand why there is such a huge range in price for garlic presses. Yes, the $2.99 press from Ikea feels like it will snap in your hand but do the $40+ presses I see really do that much of a better job? This press is only $10 but it is well-made and presses garlic flawlessly. Even large gloves.I've used mine for almost a year, several times a month, and it still works and looks new. I can see why some people think it is plastic: the all-aluminum construction is very light and it is polished to give it a non-metallic feel."
2,Does the job but finish is coming off,"I got this for Christmas (3 months ago) and the finish is already coming off. I use this item about 3 times per week for about 3-4 garlic cloves per time. I would say this is moderate use for a garlic press. I wash it by hand and use the little tool to remove the garlic skins but the finish is chipping on the hinge and in the cavity that holds the garlic clove. The press does do a good job of mincing the garlic but when I replace this item (sooner than I was planning) I will not buy this model again. I really do not want whatever the finish is made from in the food that I prepare for my family. Overall, I am disappointed that this is wearing out after only three months of use."
4,Wash it right away,once ur done using it wash it or else it becomes more difficult spraying out the garlic. Other than that it does what i think it should do. I cant really compare it to any other press since i havent used one but its decnent for the price
4,Good Product,"I bought this based on other people's reviews of the product, I didn't want anything fancy, I just wanted something that did the job of pressing garlic. This does that, it is very easy to use, very easy to clean and has a good grip so that you don't have to be a muscle man to press the garlic. I would highly recommend this product, the price is good, and it works."
1,Fell apart. Too small.,This cheap contraption fell apart. All of the hinges unhinged. And the space where you put the garlic is really small. Fits maybe 2 cloves. I'd spend my money elsewhere.
2,Works - but I'd better chop with a knife,"The garlic press works. This is my first Garlic Press. So I can not compare it with other garlic press. But after one use, I have decided to chop garlic myself the old fashion way with a large Chinese clever knife. It's a lot faster than using this garlic press.If you decide to use this garlic press, be prepared a lot garlic stuck in those little holes. I have not found an easy way to get those garlic out, other than high pressure water to wash them out. Needless to say, a lot garlic down to drain. I'd rather eat garlic, instead of washing them into a drain."
3,Great while it lasted,"I really liked this at first. It got a lot of garlic out of peeled cloves and was easy to clean. However, after 15 months of 2x per week use, the hinge that holds the press in the hopper has broken. It is still sort of usable, but having to align the press into the hopper with every clove is a pain. It also holds one medium or two small cloves at a time, so that is a lot of realigning. It is inexpensive, but if you have to replace it yearly, you are better off going with something a little higher quality."
1,Defective,"Fell apart after 11 months of very light use. Seems to be a quality product, but that is deceptive. I strongly urge you to look elsewhere."
2,Poor Hinge Design Ruins Fine Product,"First the good points: This garlic press is made of sturdy, lightweight aluminum, has great ergonomics, good capacity, presses well and is easy to clean. Unfortunately, some idiot decided to save a few cents in manufacturing costs with a hinge design -- both on the handle and the swing-out tamper -- that fails within a few months (at least for active cooks). A solid hinge would make this a fantastic garlic press worth more than the asking price. As it is, it's a waste of money and more scrap aluminum in the recycle bin. Keep looking."
3,OK - better than some but still too complex,This press is adequate but inferior to presses with a smaller press area which are able to provide more pressure. I prefer an older model which is less fancy and gets the job done with less residual material in the press chamber.
4,Great product,"I will start by saying I've never had a garlic press before so while I think it is fantastic, I have nothing to compare. Anyway, it does a really effective job of pressing the garlic out and leaving the skin behind. Occasionally I have a large piece that doesn't fit well in the press but if you work it carefully, you'll get the job done. My only real complaint is that I wish the cleaner was somehow attached to the unit. Apparently I'm a bit disorganized because I can't always find the little green poker when I need to. But that's okay, because toothpicks work, if a little tedious."
1,Damaged DVD,"DVD arrived broken, split in half. Will have to repurchase to find out if the movie is good. Might want to upgrade the packaging on your shipment."
4,If you like black metal you will like this one,I bought this cd cause ive known about Absu since the early 90's and this cd covered that era to the early 21st century.They have changed a great deal over the years but their music hasnt its still raw grim black metal from an American band in Texas.If you like your metal raw you will love this cd if you dont then dont buy it for extreme metal lovers only.
3,"The exercises are good, but same as her video","I already had the Target and Tone video by Kathy Kaehler (and I absolutely love it!) and I ordered this book to have something to alternate with by her. The book, though, is almost entirely the same exercises as the that video tape. The ""Hollywood"" format with stories of celebrities is cute but corny and doesn't seem to inspire. I don't seem to remember Claudia Schiffer or Michelle Pfeiffer having to lose weight (or an substantial amount of weight), but they are used as examples of dedication. Who among the ""real world"" will rise at 4:30 a.m. to exercise? Anyway, if you have her T & T video, skip this book. If you need a good, safe routine to start with from scratch, it's $12 or so well spent.Advanced exercisers would be bored."
1,Nerve Wracking,"If you are nuts about squirrels or nuts or squirrely, you might like this book. Without the squirrels it was a tolerable read. With the squirrels, I found myself skipping great chunks in sheer aggravation. That made for a quick read. Think twice before spending your hard earned cash. Or even three times."
4,One of the Best!,This is one of the funniest books I've read. Great characters and excellent dialogue.
3,"""It's OK""","I was tempted to give this only 2-stars, but I guess it is ""OK"". The book is interesting in some ways but I found it easy to get bogged down in it. The rather meteorological descriptions of the Thames at virtually every scene change got a bit old. And, in a recession, reading about the guy's life falling a part gets a tad depressing too..."
4,Artistic and Fun but...,"I read this years ago and thought it was fabulous but on rereading it lacks structure and leaves me behind. I wanted to love it but I didn't, my problem is that I am looking for really good humour in a world of depression perhaps I have been spoilt by Bigfoot Littlefoot and West. For any art lover this is fun and the end is brilliant but it is not as funny as I wanted, perhaps I am asking for too much. I did like the boy a lot, try it anyway."
5,A Transforming Experience,"No one who reads this novel will be left unchanged by it. Gulley Jimson draws us into the experience of art from the artist's point of view. As with the art and poetry of William Blake, Gulley's personal theology, the reader cannot be neutral about an encounter with this work. I have read the novel several times, and I always feel refreshed, energized, and capable of anything afterwards. Just like Gulley, after an encounter with Sara: ""I felt I could paint. As always after a party. Life delights in life. Especially with Sara."""
3,Couldn't use 2 of these at the same time,I bought this and the Donkey Kong one for my 2 nephews. They look great and are pretty durable. HOWEVER...they couldn't be operated at the same time because the controllers for each of them also controlled the other. It was very frustrating because the boys wanted to race each other but weren't able to. Don't know if we were the only ones to get controllers set to the same frequency or if that's how they all come. But they didn't enjoy them as much since only one of them could play with it at a time.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst game I've ever tried on my computer to date. Don't even think that you can load it and drive the car with any degree of success on a keyboard. Even if you have a joystick or a racing wheel (which I purchased) the game locks up. There is no customer support aside from the usual (fix it) facts that come via e-mail. Yeah I know it only cost ...but NHRA should be ashiamed of themselves for buying into this. Oh and one more thing THEY ARE RELEASING NHRA II. I hope they worked the bugs out of this one seeing that they used this poor suckers money to fund it.
1,This game really is sorry,This game is really bad. Is should be a whole lot cheaper than 9.99. First you can't steer worth a flip an there is no customer support they say that they can't do much to help you out. My best bet to do with your money is to buy a game made by bethsoft like IHRA or Championship drag racing or Burnout. Don't make the same mistake I did.
3,Freshmen dorm,"I thought that this book was a good book to relate to. Even though im not in college there is still some pressures ,and this book is showing that you can get thourght it , especially with the right friends. This book also shows how strong a friend ship bond can be. Over all i thought it was a good book."
3,Still Useful?,"I must admit to being very skeptical. I read it, but given the staggering bursting of the dot-com Internet bubble, I have some severe doubts whether Janal's book is as relevant or just plain right as it was when he wrote it. It was published in 2000, so Janal probably finished writing it by 1999. Before the bursting, then.The Internet still has its uses, but an Internet-only strategy? eBay might do it, but if AOL is having troubles . . .I liked Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired because, despite the name, it combines both Internet and non-Internet strategies.Janal has some good ideas and his examples are good ones, but I'm fairly certain not in the way he intended them to be."
3,Fluff and Substance,"Nice book, but a bit too much fluff to fill in the substance gaps. To much make money quick kind of information. I checked out Starting a business website and make your website work for you. Also killer content. These gave me a bit more hands on experience and background that i could use."
1,Not Good,"A dull book with lots of conventional marketing principles. It may work for someone with no Internet experience. For me, it is a complete waste of my money.The book asks you to apply questioning principles but gives you few specific guides on how to do them correctly.I shouldn't have believed in the reviews posted here."
1,Boring,"I found this book to be a sleeper. I was falling asleep after the second chapter. If you are someone who reads to help yourself fall asleep, maybe you should get this book. However, if you are serious about online marketing I don't recommend it."
5,Great Book,I recently bought your book and read it on a beach in Antigua - much to the astonishment of the people around me! I thoroughly enjoyed it and it has opened my eyes to some exciting posibilities - we are clearly a bit behind the times this side of the pond!Jonathan Grantonholdservices.com.uk
1,Do not buy this or else you will be supporting robocalling,Do not buy this or else you will be supporting robocalling.Imagine being a trauma surgeon and having an emergency phone and getting a call about a children's movie.
5,A truly fantastic movie for all to see,"This movie is absolutely wonderful, just like the book. It is a powerful story which is timeless and very true to life. The first time I read this story as an adult, I was moved to tears; the same is true with this movie. (I guess it was put out on the shelf early, judging from the release date, because I found this movie at Target the other day for $9.99.) The movie is well done in every way, from the acting to the music to the scenery. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is worth the price. Buy it; watch it; share it! And my thanks to Nick, Philip, Michael, Chris and Hunter - who made me Real! :)"
5,The Velveteen Rabbit,The Velveteen Rabbit was a great DVD. This movie is for all ages. We needmore movies like this so the whole family can watch together.
1,Enchanted Musical Performance: The Velveteen Rabbit,"The title of this video is very misleading. In fact it does not say ""Musical"" anywhere on the packaging. This is nothing more than Meryl Streep reading a childrens book with drawings on the screen and music in the background. There is no ""Musical Performance"" and Amazon.com should not represent it at such."
1,BOO!,"BOOOO! Don't buy this movie. This new version sucks so bad. It's not the original story line I remember from the book or the 1985 video adaption narrated by Meryl Streep, with music by George Winston.[...]Buy the old version, it's better. Seriously."
5,The Velvateen Rabbit,Very good movie for children; also adults. Service at Amazon.com with regular shipping was excellent. We had the movie within 5 days.
5,Fantastic Family Movie,We watched the DVD last night. The kids enjoyed it. Very heart warming. One of my kids found her plush animals she hadn't played with in a long time and has been hugging it ever since watching this DVD. It brought back found memories of the joy of using your imagination when playing with your toys.
1,"Excessive, tangential rambling.","A volume of excessive kisses of self aggrandizement. Clobbered with sparring bouts of the feminist as citizen victim. At best, not well thought out, but angry and marginalized with redundant humor. This is certainly one book you could not judge by its cover. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
1,Everyone in the world is the problem - except Jill,"This is just another poorly edited, poorly written, and poorly conceived blame whitey, blame black men, blame society, blame everyone but yourself race books. A book of essays should convey challenging and intelligent arguments and thoughts. Nelson's book is just a collection of silly generalizations. This book was clearly written on the fly. Readers seeking smart writing by real intellectuals should try Shelby Steele and bell hooks. All I learned from this book is how embittered and mean spirited a person Jill Nelson is."
5,very detailed book,"if you are a clean freak and just want things to shine and smell right and be right, then this is the book for you period. i was so sparked after reading this book and all the information it had in it. very much needed and appreciated. a true classic on keeping things and surroundings clean."
4,Good Try,This is pretty good. Not the real artists but almost the same (likable) sounding as the orginals.
2,A Funny Horror Movie But Is Still Not That Great,"This is the kind of movie that would be compared to something like Chopper Chicks in Zombietown. It has all the laughs, some frights, but too funny to take seriously. That's the issue with Idle Hands. Devon Sawa doesn't take the fact that his parents are dead very emotionally, which is weird.The only part of this movie I really hate is the ending. It completely stunk, and made me agree that it was only a two and a half star movie. There are a lot of people who still like this movie and I hink it's great. But to give this film three stars is silly.I could watch this movie again and still find it funny. That's about how good it is."
5,One of the better examples of the teen/horror/comedy genre.,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie the first time I saw it. The concept had been done before (possesed hand gets chopped off, kills people a la Evil Dead) and is incredibly cliched (a possesed guy goes on a killing spree. Hmmm...). The cast is just a bunch of ""teenagers"" doing another I Know What You Did Last Summer take and at the same time, copying Scream in terms of trying to be another horror-comedy. But you know what? It works. It works *very* well. The cast is great (Seth Green steals the show, again!), there are a bunch of hilarious one-liners (""Please don't be stupid. Do you have, like, an evil 'ant?'""), and Jessica Alba is hot. :^) You'd be surprised how many laughs the director and writers managed to squeeze out of bong-hittin teens going through all the motions of your average b-horror movie. Get this movie. You won't regret it."
2,RIPOFF,"This movie is a total ripoff of Evil Dead 2. This isn't even sick or disturbing, it actually pretty tame and really not funny.The acting is downright horrible, but I guess its supposed to be for the comedy. See Evil Dead 2, thats a horror comedy, or if you think you can handle it, Dead Alive (unrated version). They are much better and ten times funnier than this bubble gum.This movie gets two stars because the scene where the EVIL DEAD 2 WANNABE hand was slinging the cat around was hilarious."
4,An original horror/comedy,"I knew I wanted to see ""Idle Hands"" when I first saw the previews last year. I finally saw it on TV and it wasn't like I thought it would be. I thought it was just gonna be a comedy movie, but it combines horror and comedy. A pot smoker's hand gets possessed to where he can't control it. He gets tired of killing everybody he sees, so he cuts it off and it gets loose on the streets. They have to find it and kill it any way they can.I recommend anybody who likes comedy or horror movies to watch ""Idle Hands."" It has good acting and it does have a few funny parts such as when he throws the cat out of the window. There's only one thing I didn't understand about the movie. Why did Anton's 2 pot smoking friends come back alive and the other people didn't? Overall, this is a good movie and it's original."
2,one semi-funny movie with one hot girl!,"this movie had some funny parts,the guy who worked onhis truck was pretty funny!the two buddies were okay whenthey came back from the dead,the guy with the possessedhand did a good job.but forthe best reason to watch thismovie is jessica alba,thisbabe is hot! i hope hollywoodhas sense enough to cast herin upcoming movies.good onesnot silly ones like this."
3,Would you Look at Jessica Alba!,"Wow, this movie was incredibly terrible. ""Idle Hands"" are the devil's playground. Nobody cares. Anton (Devon Sawa) is a teenager who uses his inhaler as an 'instrument.' Not cool dude. His right hand then becomes possessed and starts to murder. His parents, family and almost his girlfriend (Jessica Alba). That hand deserved major punishment going after ""Dark Angel"" like that. Aside from the horrible plot, watch this movie because of how good Jessica Alba looks, nothing else."
2,you've gotta be kidding me,"Let me be direct: 90% of the movie sucks. The acting and effects are decent. But the story, the direction, and well, pretty much everything else, are bad.A few minutes into the movie, I thought it was a horror movie. Even then I was disappointed because it's not nearly horrifying enough. Then a third of the movie gone by, the plot became more and more ridiculous, and only then did I realize that the filmmakers wanted to make it a black comedy. But just that the movie has the style of a black comedy doesn't mean that the filmmakers would feel obliged to offer you any laughs, witty dialouges or dark humor. The movie has none of those.The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is some really really terrible movies deserve the lowest grade more than this one does. Not by a lot, though, I have to say."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME !!!!,"THis movie is ridiculous. Even watching it as a black-horror comedy, it is horrible. To show gore is the only goal of the movie and even this fails, because the special effects are stupid. This could be a ""trash"" or ""B"" movie great picture, but everyone involved (teen actors, director, etc) are uninspired. This was a shame to the horror genre, which already is full of prejudices against it."
1,BAD HANDS,"There's nothing wrong with this movie, if you like a bunch of bad tasted sequences, terrible acting, bad horror, this is the movie for you."
4,Take it for what it's meant to be,"This is obviously not meant to win an oscar, and if you start with that attitude, it may help. I enjoyed this movie very much, except for the drug promotion. Seth Green as usual is a master, dont be suprised to see him nominated for an Oscar for real, SOMEDAY. For us males, Jessica Alba will steal your heart throughout this movie, and her rear end puts Jennifer Lopez to shame. Your teen age kids will all like this, mine did. And I laughed right with them. Take it for what its worth and meant to be, and you may find yourself in stitches if you are not careful."
3,Its actually better than it looks,"A lazy pothead that spends his whole day lying around, watching TV and smoking bongs suddenly finds out that his right hand is possessed and goes on a killing spree. Loaded with a lot of grusome scenes like somebody getting a broken beer bottle shoved through his head and another guy getting his head cut off is actually a lot funnier than some would think. Although it is nothing terribly special, its allot better than most in its genre and is deffinately worth watching. As a DVD its very good. The picture and sound quality is reasonable and it has quite a lot of good extras. Any horror fan should have it."
5,Pays homage to slasher spoofs...,"I find it such a shame that Sony did not delay the release of this film due to the Columbine tragedy. I'm certain that this hilarious slasher would have made a more than respectable gross. The film certainly differs from other run-of-the-mill slasher 'teen' movies, the characters were actually amusing rather than irritating, the make-up was fantastic and the end result was hilarious. Two thumbs up."
5,hilarious and gross--a nice combo,"This movie was extremely funny, and well it does have its fair share of gore, it is played mainly for laughs. A teen slacker's hand is possessed and he unknowingly becomes a killer. Devon Sawa and his hand do a nice job, and Seth Green is hilarious as usual.And remember, do not eat burritos if your head is not firmly attatched to your body."
3,Worth Seeing,"""Idle hands are the Devil's play things.""There you have the basic concept of this film. Well, sort of. The basic idea is that a slacker wakes up one day to discover his hand is possessed and when it is not busy, it is trying to kill everyone around him-including his best friends. He does kill them actually, and they come back as zombies who mock him.Sound weird? It gets weirder. This movie is more of a horror-spoof than an actual horror film, yet its scary moments are much better done than, say, those of Scream. Then when it turns to comedy and parody it excels! The movie is actually really funny, and it takes itself so lightly, that you get the feeling the cast and characters they play are laughing right along with you.Idle Hands is a fun film that any horror fan should enjoy. It doesn't do what so many films unfortunately do today-take itself too seriously."
4,Christopher Hart's Hand Is Awesome,"I rented this movie because Playboy Playmate Kelly Monaco has a featured role. Idle Hands is an entertaining, funny, and delightful movie nevertheless. Christopher Hart of Addams Family fame (""Thing""), and other roles requiring his enmorously long fingers, plays Devon's severed hand. At one point, Hart's hand enters a car window as Kelly and her boyfriend are making out. This scene is quite hot and Charistopher Hart's lone hand gets in on the fun. His large hand and long fingers really give Kelly's rack a workout!"
3,Morbid and cheesy to the point that it made me laugh.,"This movie was so unrealistic and far fetched it was actualy funny.If you are a very serious person,this movie isen't for you,but on the other hand{hand,get it}if you like gory hypothetical movies IDLE HANDS might have a few laughs."
2,More of a preverted horror flcik than a dead beat comedy!,"The humor is low and the horror is high! This teen flick will nauseate your stomahcs as Antoin Tobias (Devon Sawa) stars as a drug atic who sits around like a slug and disovers his hand has been possessed by Lucifer and he must stop it before he kills anyone else besides his parents! Jesica Alba stars as his hot girlfriend and Seth Green stars as Devon's duggy friend as well! NOT RECOMMENED! Rated R for nudity, strong horror violence, drug use and language."
2,what's the idea behind?,"what's the idea behind it, I spent the whole evening thinking of what they want us to see, it's violent movie, full of killing scenes. I saw horror movies before let's take an example (Blair Witch) this is something for real you feel your body shake like a blinder and you spend the whole night wake. this movie is not like this, they want to say that ideal hands are devils playground !!! or they just want us think that smoking drugs will cause you to do bad things, actually I do not recommend it."
2,Idle laughs...,"Yer another comedy flop. The film promises, but never quite delivers. Sure it's corny, hammy and dumb and for a while it's funny, but towards the end it just becomes stupid. These teen comedies don't really appeal to me, but the small horror content of this film saves it from being boring. It just could have been much funnier."
3,idle hands are the devils playthings,"a stoner kids hand makes him start killing people.his 2 best friends return as zombies.eventualy he chops it off and it runs loose killing people.a whole bunch of nobodies are in it.it is low budget.doesnt anyone spend money on a horror film?it is really good though.there are a few ladies running about.a mexican chick next door,[ok people christineaguliera is yesterdays news and just because shes hot doesnt mean every spanish chick in the world is}.then theres this crazy jewish-black priestess chick who wants to kill everything and finaly the only hot chick in the movie is a chick whose in the film long enough to take off her shirt and get murdered.the priestess is obnoxious.this movie is a lot more entertaining than any sell outs and phonies will admit to.i dont know what on earth theyd do for a sequel but id love to see them try."
2,B-grade horror/comedy,"Pretty low budget (minimal F/X, if any), B-grade horror/comedy that of course gets its main + points as an intro to Dark Angel's Jessica Alba. Maybe worth a looksie if you're *really* into quasi-horror/wanna-be comedy films or are curious, but otherwise you're not missing much of anything if you even skip the $1 rental--really no ""horror"" surprises beyond the first five minutes or so. Pretty simple and not terribly original, dramatic, or impressive, and generally not recommended as a film worth seeing, *very* unlike an Unbreakable, Frequency, Sixth Sense, etc.... The general concept could have been done *far* far further, and still may one day resulting in a top-notch horror film."
5,Love this Movie,"Saw it about 7 years ago.. been looking for it ever since!Thank god for amazonStoners, possessions, ... and Seth GREEN! lmaoFunny and a Classic Horror/Comedy/Parody"
4,"Cheesy as Hell, loved every minute of it","There are very few people I would consider truly GREAT actors. Many are along the lines of folks such as Harvey Keitel, Sameul L. Jackson and the such. But in my world, Seth Green falls in with them.Not the best film to display his immense talent, but Green definately shines in this movie. Jessica Alba (and I hold no biases based on my love for her haha) also displays that young talent, although often type-cast, can still bring 'em home.I wasn't impressed with Vivica A. Fox's character in any way, but the others seemed to click with me.If you're a teen, or young adult, *I* recommend it."
4,Gory and hysterical romp!,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie so I was delighted when it proved to be funny, clever, and well-made. The actors do a great job and the dialogue is totally believable; despite the pot-smoking and lax attitude of the teenagers, the swearing is relatively limited, which I always think of as a sign of a good film. Don't get me wrong - this isn't a great film, it's silly schlock - but it's entertaining, fun schlock. Watching the film with the audio commentary by the director and two of the actors (after you've seen the film straight through the first time) is a blast and a half. Definitely worth getting on DVD just for the audio commentary. Reminds me of a combination of Half-Baked, Clerks, and Evil Dead 2."
3,THE DEVIL'S WORKSHOP,"IDLE HANDS has more misses than hits, but one can't help but find the overall movie amusing. Devon Sawa does a very good job with his possessed hand, some have already mentioned it's likeness to Steve Martin in ALL OF ME. Bringing back his friends (Seth Green, Elden Henson) as zombies is a direct ripoff from both American Werewolf movies, and even though derivative as such, are buoyant and fun. Viveca Fox as the hand hunter is hilarious, as is Jack Noseworthy as the pseudo-studly Randy. There is lots of gore, pot smoking, even nutmeg/oregano smoking, but in this day and age, what teen movie wouldn't have it. The overuse of soundtrack songs is as always distracting, but again, when one targets a teen audience, this is what one gets. However, the musical score itself by Graeme Revell is very good. This is one of those movies you watch when you need a good laugh, and even though it's not as funny as you want it to be, it still delivers."
1,This is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen.,"This movie is absolutely disgusting. It has an idiotic plot, and a terrible cast.I'm generally one who likes a lot of movie genres -- drama, adventure, action, comedy, some horror, sci-fi.. This film tries to make horror funny by using excessive violence. It is disgusting. I'm an 18 year old teen, and I've seen some pretty bad movies, but nothing near this. It's one of the few movies I've ever considered stopping in the middle because it was so gory."
2,"Idle Hands, early Jessica Alba film, teenage slaughter film","Idle hands is a poorly made teenage serial killer film, in which a slacker teenager's hand is possessed and kills other teenagers. Jessica Alba has a small part as a girlfriend. Skip this film"
1,Halloween horror-comedy is bloody awful and gross,"Idle Hands (1999) Devon Sawa, Seth Green, Elden Henson, Jessica Alba, Vivica A. Fox, Jack Noseworthy, Katie Wright, D: Rodman Flender.Teenage couch potato-stoner discovers Satan possesses his right hand and he can't control its murderous impulses in this dreadful horror-comedy.Movie is just as dopey and lazy as its character is, and its high gore quotient rules out its low laughs (in both senses). Might attract its aimed audience of teenage boys and Fangoria Magazine readers.Running Time: 90 minutes and rated R for horror violence and gore, pervasive teen drug use, language, and sexuality."
1,what?,"I wish i could give no stars for this movie! it is terrible! one of the worst movie i have seen.Disgusting,not funny,with a ridiculous story.I have just seen it,and boy, was it terrible...YUCK!!!!"
1,BLOODY HANDS ....,"Well, all you'll get watching this freak movie is a little bit of gore ( bad special effects, by the way .. )and some young actors who seem to be wearing skirts yet ... Sad. Skip it."
1,Not worthy of being called a horror movie.,"This movie was sooo stupid, and filled with all-around crappy acting. (with the exception of Seth Green) As for comedy, the fact that 3 kids sitting around smoking pot for a good deal of the movie is supposed to be funny kinda scares me. Don't bother watching this one."
5,my favorite movie of all time!,"i wrote a review earlier saying that vivicia fox got half naked at the end but i think it was jessica alba or something i think.anyway,this movie is totally worth getting.after you rent it,you'll want to buy it!it was hilarious! very entertaining.see this movie!"
1,What a rediculous waste of time!,I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE!I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! JESSICA ALBA IS HOT BUT THE MOVIE IS UGLY! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE!
5,A fond favourite,"I love this movie, its just one of those movies you can watch over and again, and you will find something different to make you laugh at (in a good way though). If you havent seen this movie then see it now. Actually don't even see it jjust buy it."
4,Bathroom sink faucets,I like this faucet set. It matches another one I have in gold. I like the chrome and it has been easy to take care of. No brown spots or loss of color. I would definitely buy it again.This is a good faucet replacement when you want to cover up the area that your previous faucet used.
1,Do not buy these!,"I buy these Verbatim discs on a regular basis from other companies and never have a problem. Out of the first 10 discs on the spool, 9 were defective. I just stop trying to use them. I have not had 1 defective Verbatim disc from any other company. I will not go through the problems of returning them but will never buy them from this source again."
3,Don't burn at 16X,"I lost the first three disks trying to burn them at the stated speed of 16X. Once I reduced the burn speed to 12X, everything worked well. Also, The package I received was broken at the base but that could have been from shipping. Overall, these disks work well at the lower speed but I expected better quality from Verbatim."
1,DO NOT BUY VERBATIM 97460,"I have used Verbatim blank DVD-R discs for years....having burned over 2,000 over the last 6 years. When these discs were made by Mitsubishi, the quality was tops. Now that these are made in the United Arab Emirates, the quality is gone. I experienced 68 discs not finalizing out of the 100-count spindle I just bought. Sixty-eight! Never again!"
1,They won't work in my DVD player,"I am sorry I ordered these DVD-Rs but I needed some to burn my movie to DVD for my cast & crew. Unfortunately, the DVD-Rs do not work in my player. I am not sure why but I am about to return them for a refund. Waste of money!"
3,When finished DVD's will stick over & over upon playing,"Trying to determine whether the sticking problem, upon playing the completed DVD's is a problem with the DVD-R disc, or is with the JVC transport writing deck used to create the original DVD, from the hard drive, or a DV-mini tape cassette. We've not had this difficulty using, single layer, Memorex, or Maxell brands."
5,Simply the best,Still the best discs you can buy in a retail store. The only discs that are marginally better than Verbatim are Taiyo Yudens that are more expensive and only available online. As far as quality per dollar spent Verbatim is #1. Verbatims are made by Mitsubishi thats why the quality is so high. These discs go on sale at Best Buy every month for only $12.99. Verbatim is so confident in their discs they give you a lifetime warranty
1,Second Time Not A Charm,"My first 100 stack was flawless. So i ordered another 100 stack a few months later. My second stack started to have write errors about a 1/4 of the the way down, and hoping that it was only 1 disc I pulled another DVD towards the bottom of the stack with the same results. I have so far burned 5 duds in a row with DVDs from various levels of the spindel. I've sent Verbatim support an e-mail hopfully to get a replacement, if that doesn't work i guess ill see if Amazon will make it right."
5,Simply the best,"these are simply the best discs on the market, especially for the price here. The discs are fantastic discs and generally have no problems at all. the AZO dye should be the industry standards"
5,Third Time buying this product! Worth every penny!,"I have yet to have any problems using these. They're a great price, and I burn DVDs all the time...these are perfect."
5,398 out of 400 worked,I bought 4 of these and one stack had 2 bad DVD's. I'd say 398 out of 400 isn't bad. I was burning using MacBook Pros.
5,Cheap and reliable product. A/V reproduction sharp.,"I got this item on sale (very cheap). I had only 1 of the 50 disks fail me, and that error probably was my fault. The key to getting quality copies burned is to avoid filling the disks to the capacity listed on the package. And just to be on the safe side, I always avoid running other programs or surfing the net when I'm burning a disk. The A/V quality deteriorates noticeably as you approach the media's storage limit. Verbatim has always been good to me and I would recommend the brand to any body."
2,"14 out of 100 failed, that is a 14% failure rate !",I bought the 100 pack and in a month went through it and 14 would error out. So I cannot recommend these for recording.
5,Great Quality,I am using these with a Sony 16X DVD burner and have had great experience. I have used already two 100 disk spindles without any erros. I have used the recorded DVDs in many different DVD players and DVD drives without any issue.
5,Great price,Great price. Good value. Only downside was cracked plastic holder/case due to lack of packing material. Would order again if needed.
4,Larry's supplies,I download a lot of movies-a minumum of 6 movies a week. I also make copies for my 2 sons regularly. I go throw a lot ofdvd blank.Nignht vision glasses for me-my wife- my daughter. I love you guys THANKS
5,excellent media,"I don't buy any other media for burning. I have the best luck with this brand. Very rare occasions to end up with a coaster. When it happens, I am sure my computer is to blame and not the disc. Anyway, great item and I continue to have success so I won't be changing anytime soon."
3,Does not work with my Mid-2009 MacBook Pro,"These do not work with my MacBook Pro 2009. By that, i should elaborate. I use AnyDVD and Clone DVD on my boot camp windows XP partition and every single time it is time to write the DVD, the drive simply spits out these Verbatim discs.BUT these discs work flawlessly with my Home made Windows XP desktop with Sony dvd writer.That is why it gets only 3 stars. Doesnt work at all with my Mac/winXP partition, but works perfectly with my Sony DVD writer.I will stick withMemorex 4.7Gb/16x DVD-R (50-Pack Spindle)for my Macbook Pro 2009-mid edition, because i use the mac more often."
3,Neither that good or bad. Surprisingly...,"I've had at least 8 discs that were ruined, having 1 or none before with this brand...surprisingly an unacceptable rate. I hope it's just a fluke..or maybe because this is a DVD-R instead of the +R's that I usually buy."
3,Was Just OK,"The Verbatim blank 100 DVD-R's I purchased was just OK!I have a DVD Recorder and 2 other DVD players one being a portable dvd player I wanted to record Movies from cable so when i was on the road i could watch some of my cable recorded Movies, the only thing is that once i recorded the Movies to watch on my portable player the Movies kept freezing cracking up like a broken window pane this was only when i played them on my portable dvd player. why i don't know! but when i record Movies using other blank DVD dics such as Staples brand or HP Brand or Memorex brand or Sony I had no problems at all playing these disc on my portable dvd player. so I have gone back to HP Brand DVD-RDon't get me wrong My Recorded Movies recorded on Vabetim played ok on my Home DVD player but did not play well on my portable player. sometimes you just have to shop around. but as i said you get what you pay for."
4,The DVD are Good but the Box...,"I received the Verbatim 100-Disc Spindle DVD in good conditions. However, the box was too damaged. Please, tell UPS that this material should be ""Handled with Care"" for future references. Thanks"
5,excellent,"very good product. so far, every disc I burned is successful. I will recommend it to my friends without any researvation."
3,My videos skip sometimes,"I use these dvd's for two purposes. First as media storage where they do the job just fine. Second as dvd's for friends and family to watch home videos. However sometimes my video skips, freezes, and restarts at random. I don't know if it's just a bad dvd, or the program that I use to put the video onto the disk (miDVD on the iMAC)"
4,95102 discs,"The only reason I chose this rating is because 3 of the cases of the 4 I received were broken. Otherwise, it gets a 5 star rating."
4,Great discs but poor shipping,"These discs are great, so far as I can tell. But I agree with other reviewers who say that Amazon needs to do a better job of packaging. The disc container was packed in air-filled platic pouches, but there was still plenty of room for it to roll around in transit. I don't know whether that damaged the discs, but a couple of them did not work. However, in general these discs do just what I wanted."
2,They...don't work?,"After doing some research, I decided to use this highly recommended brand of DVDs to burn my PS2 backups. Unfortunately, every single DVD I tried failed at around 11-15%. Granted, I don't have the best burner but I can't blame it when it's only this particular brand that fails the same way under every circumstance. I'm giving it one star for it's price and another star in case it might serve some use in the future."
3,Not the best Verbatim around.,"The first batch I've got would only burn on my best burner, and at the slowest speed I've experienced (less then 1x). Sent them back, and the replacement ones are still not faster than 6x, but at least they're usable. There is better Verbatim discs around, I don't know if it's just Amazon that didn't get the good ones."
3,Like opening 20 brand new CD's,"The blank DVD's are fine, typical 4.7 GB storage, and each one comes packaged in it's own jewel case. However, it was a little annoying that DVD case was shrink wrapped. If you want this feature, it's great, but I didn't really like unwrapping each and every case before use; I felt like all the plastic was wasteful. Plus the cases didn't come with a paper insert to be able to write what each DVD had on it. Would've been nice to have that in order to keep the discs organized."
1,Very disappointed in these DVDs,"I have purchased Verbatim DVD+R and -R for several years now and have had nothing but good luck with them, with an approximate 99% success ratio. All my past purchases have been made from local stores near my home area. I only buy Verbatim or TDK.Recently, in order to save a few dollars, for first time I purchased two spindles through Amazon (the DVD-R) with AZO) and every third disc is a failure that will not write to disc or if it does write to disc, the finished product skips or stalls in the DVD player. The majority of these discs end up in the garbage.I am hugely disappointed and DO NOT RECOMMEND these to anyone. I will never again purchased DVDs online again."
1,Complete Waste of Money!,"The first 5 or so discs worked, but after that only abour one in 5 were usable. Every burning program rejected them as not being blank. These are a complete waste of money."
1,There's no difference!,"Totally disappointed! This brand is no different from HP/Sony/Maxell, etc.I compared burned data on Verbatim and the others and believe it or notthe less named brands did better. I was looking for clear and crisp photosit failed. Sorry!"
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"PURCHASED THIS ITEM SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, AND IT WOULD NOT RECORD ON MY THREE DVD RECORDERS. I MANAGED TO SALVAGE SOME BY WASHING THEM WITH SOAP AND WATER. TERRIBLE PRODUCT. I STILL HAVE ABOUT 20 OF THEM AS A REMINDER NEVER TO BUY VERBATIM DVD DISKS AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN RECORDING DVD'S FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH OTHER BRANDS. I PURCHASED VERBATIM BECAUSE IT HAD A RATHER HIGH RATING.WHAT A JOKE!."
2,Bad experience,Received DVD's damaged due to inproper packaging by the vendor.Vendor refused to exchange damaged discs.
1,Definitely not for macs,"I have about 75% coasters using leopard [Mac osx 10.5]. Piece of junk. It was a total waste of money. TDK, OTOH, has had 0% failure so far."
3,"Was good, now?????","Have ALWAYS used these DVD-R discs. They identify as MCC 03RG20. That said I have burned over 3000 of these discs with no problem. I recently made a order of 200 from Amazon, thus far I've used 120 of them I have a stack of about 50 coasters. I really hope this Amazon hasn't gotten a batch of fakes of MCC 03RG20 disc. I am gonna email Verb and see what they say."
2,"UPDATE: Were the best. Last batch, no good.","I have already reviewed the Memorex blanks & you can see it here at Amazon. The horrible quality of the Memorex blanks pushed me into buying Verbatim brand & I have to thank Memorex for doing so. I've bought Verbatim 4 times now & every time, they come in perfect order & every disc works. That's right, 400 discs & they all work. I will never switch to another blank for as long as I need them.UPDATE: After ordering my last batch of these Verbatim discs, I will now have to find another brand. Of the 100 discs, maybe 75 of them were no good. Error after error. They were used in both my computers 2 drives & also my DVD recorder. The same results. I lost so much information with these discs that will take me forever to get back. I'm very disappointed & am sorry to have recommended them at all."
3,"Packaging inadequate, spindles arrive broken","Amazon still has not figured out how to ship these 100 pack DVD-R's. They are heavy and if they can move in the box, the spindle package will break, and did. I ordered two and both arrived broken."
5,save money by buying here,"Bough this product a while back and so far no problems. With no problems, I'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else."
5,Does the Job,Exactly as advertised and did the job. I actually haven't even finished using this set and it's already been years since I bought this!
4,Verbatim DVD-R,"I was using an off-brand DVD-R to record TV shows and was getting quite a few ""Error"" messages. Sometimes my recorder would not even recognize the disk. Since switching to Verbatim I have not had one problem. I have only used 4-or 5 out of a 50-disk spindle or I would have rated it higher. Based on my results so far, I would recommend Verbatim."
1,My HP laptop hates these discs!,"At least 80% of these discs went in the trash due to bad sector errors, unreadable disc errors and discs that burned but failed at playback. So if you have an HP Pavillion g series, you may want to consider a different brand."
5,discs works good and no problems,"Great price and great discs, I've not had any costers with these discs and they are durable at even high write speeds. I will continue to buy these discs in the future."
4,terrible packing,"I am giving it 4 stars because the product itself is what I had hoped for. The problem was the packing for this item was ridiculous. When I received it the spindle was busted up and all there was for packing was a couple air bags one that had partially deflated and they both ended up on the same side. I had read that others had problems with packing on this product but figured they would have fixed it because of all the complaints. I am not sure if I would order this again from Amazon because they just refuse to pack these correctly to avoid damage. The foam peanuts would work much better,"
1,"Product is probably fine, but Amazon smashed it",The product arrived completely smashed apart. Amazon packed it in a ridiculous way that almost seemed designed to result in maximum smashing.They did the same thing to a spindle of CD-Rs that was purchased at the same time.I strongly recommend not purchasing this product from Amazon.
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed with this product. We ALWAYS get this brand at the store and NEVER EVER have a problem with burning things. My husband as thrown away 10 DVDs in this pack of 100. He has only used 15 of them. Not worth the money. Very VERY frustraing!
1,29 of 100 Bad,"I use DVD's for storing my RAW photo files. 29 of 100 Verbatim DVD-R's had errors. I bought 1 100 pack of Verbatim and 1 100 pack of the Amazon brand at the same time and Amazon brand DVD's had zero disc writing errors.FYI I own a retail photography studio, employ 4 and burn approximately 1500 DVD's a year. This is the worst batch I have had in several years. I have had very good luck with the Amazon brand but they were on backorder so I ordered the Verbatim to make sure i had some DVD's to use--as it worked out they both ended up coming at the same time.Bottom line: Verbatim costs more than the Amazon brand and work less. Save your money and do not buy these discs.PS If any one from Verbatim reads this, I still have the bad DVD's put aside if you want to verify."
3,I laugh at the reinforced packaging!!!,"Don't get me wrong,so far this has been a good product,and i recieved it in a timely fashion,but if this is reinforced packaging,I would hate to see normal packaging.Just as I suspected,the case was totally broken and useless when I opened the box.I don't think it damaged but a few discs,but come on!Discs are of among the best quality,but the package is not shipping quality.These must be bought in person,or Amazon should box them up properly.So,good product,I would just like to receive it UNbroken."
3,"Average Discs, hit or miss coasters.","Average discs, good shipping, packing could be MUCH better(see other reviews), 100 disc spindle in over sized box with not enough packing so spindle knocked around in box and cracked cover. No discs damaged. I have verified using latest software and firmware but still have yet to find a superior quality disc with no coasters in the pack. This spindle was only a deal because of the price/disc ratio. I find several coasters in every brand of discs I get so I go for reviews and cost savings. This disc has overall good reviews, some good sales, and lower than average coaster ratio."
3,a lazy man's sweet buy,"instead of going to a store I decided to buy this low priced deal on 100 discs and it is awesome! i agree with everyone else that they could have shipped it better (the bottom piece of the plastic container was cracked). all in all, i got a good deal on good discs"
1,Good for frisbees,About 2 out of 3 end up frisbees. Thought I would try these since there are good reviews and the cost was right. Live and learn. Better to spend a little more and be able to actually use them for something other than target practice at the garbage can!
1,"Verbatim, #1 High Coaster Making Company!!!",Yes Coaster Galore....All resembling DVD-R...This is true... Bought 2 100 count stacks and the first stack of 100 had 36 faulty disks.I am currently using the second stack which is running strong at every other disk is faulty.MY RECOMMENDATION!!! Stay away from Verbatim unless you are in need of coasters or planning some modern deco project.
1,Verbatim DVD,"I'm really horrified by the quality of these DVD's. They quality use to be very excellent and I would recommend these DVD's to anyone, but now I would warn everyone to stay away from these DVD's. They quality has really diminished. These DVD's are only good for data and music, if anyone is planning on backing up their DVD movies then I would say go with Taiyo Yuden from newegg. These DVD's are terrible for movies so avoid them."
1,so many coasters...,"I've never had so much trouble with DVD-R media as with these. I've used about a third of my spindle, and at least half of them had to be thrown away because of media errors. I thought TDK made bad discs, but these really take the cake. Never, ever buying these again. Save yourself a lot of hassle and frustration and avoid these discs."
1,I found a few bad DVD-R in this spindle,"Out of 50 discs, I found eight bad ones that would not record. I am going back to Amazon-basics,AmazonBasics 4.7 GB 16x DVD-R (100-Pack Spindle)for future orders. In the past all 100 discs have been OK, with no bad ones."
2,Horrible!,"Packaging was horrible! On that note I received broken discs. Also because of the packaging, the discs were sliding around in the packaging causing the discs to scratch on one another."
5,Verbatim 97460 4.7 GB up to 16x Branded Recordable Disc DVD-R 100-Disc...,great product cant complain still works great one of the few brands that i would buy any way thats whats up
2,Works perfect,"The first two sets of these I purchased had no issues. The third set I purchased (this set) about a third of the discs did not work and were wasted! The working discs have worked flawlessly so far, but cannot give a product a higher rating if I feel like it is a gamble to purchase another set out of fear that my next batch of discs may not work."
4,Very Good Blank DVDs,"I've ordered three of these now and one batch was near perfect and the other had a few ""coasters"". Overall I'm satisfied with the product."
1,WASTE OF MONEY !!!!,"Ive tried every method and 5 different computers and laptops, and these disks have failed on every single one of them.... and I dont mean just a few or even 20 of the disks.... all 100 of these disks failed to burn general data, dvd movie, music, etc... you get the point.... I have never had any experience like this in my entire life.... and i never usually leave reviews, but im an avid prime member and feel that i should let someone else know before they lose money as I just did."
3,Verbatim Review,"The quality seems to be suspect on these. However, I've found that they work pretty well if you burn at 4x speed. I probably wouldn't order this version again."
1,Horrible!,"I received the package, and the plastic spindle container was broken. The DVD-Rs all looked fine, but so far only 2 of the first 6 I have tried actually burned without errors. I should have done my research before purchasing Verbatim DVD-Rs."
5,These are the best dvd-roms (IMO),"Verbatim dvd-roms are the best! Unlike some other brands these are error free. TDK is the second best brand, but for now I will continue to purchase Verbatim first."
3,well... 4 out of 8 dvd failed,All I can say is... 4 out of 8 dvd failed... first three burnt with no problems.. but then 1 failed... 1 good... 2 failed... hmmm.
5,Great Buy,Received the next day and they work perfectly. I could not have asked for a better product for the price.
3,Coasters?,"Not sure if there's something wrong with my girlfriends laptop or what, but I gave her these discs and it seems everything she burns turns out bad. I've bought this brand before and never had any problems.... so who knows. Might want to invest in some TDKs."
3,Great DVDs but very poor packaging.,These are some of the best blank DVDs available. Too bad Amazon shipped them in a box that was ten times too big with very little protection. The plastic container broke into pieces and now at least a third of my discs are scratched up. Very disappointed in Amazon.
1,Don't Waste Money,"I purchase this DVD for my wii backup, for first 5 pieces DVD is burn without any problem, and after 5 pieces all burn is failure. The DVD surface likes moon surface, black spot surrounding in anywhere. It's Very Bad Quality. Complain to Amazon.com, no answer yet."
1,Can't burn DVDs on my Macbook Pro,These DVD-Rs are not compatible with my Macbook Pro's drive (HL-DT-ST DVDRW GSA-S10N). I can't burn DVDs in Mac OS X or Windows 7. Bummer.
1,Waste of money,"After wasting quite a few of these disks in my dvd recorder, I have come to the conclusion that I wasted my money on this brand. I have tried several other brands of DVD-R, and only this brand does not work. I have also tried DVD+R and DVD+RW disks of this brand, as well as other brands. All of them worked fine, EXCEPT the Verbatim. If they worked for you, then you were lucky. I will not buy this brand again."
1,the smell of the disk make me nausea,"Bought a 100-disc spindle and the smell of the blank disc is horrible. When I open the box, the disc smells like burning plastics on fire. I don't want to open the box again and immediate return it."
3,poor packageing,The item was opened and it's case cracked. I needed the merchandise so I didn't send it back.
1,A BIG Disappointment!,"I bought a 100 disk spindle of Memorex DVD+Rs earlier and found 86 were COASTERS. After reading the good reviews of the 50 disk spindle of Verbatim DVD-Rs I immediately ordered them. They arrived today and I couldn't wait to start using them. After inserting the first disk the computer asked me to ""Insert Disk"". Properties said O used space and 0 free space. All 50 disks were tested and each one was bad. 136 coasters anyone? It will cost me half the price of the DVDs to exchange them. I could have bought them locally for the same money and not wait two weeks. I have ordered many items from Amazon over the years, but don't recommend buying DVDs."
4,shipping,I'm happy with the blank discs my only concern is the container was all busted up when I open the package. Luckily there was no damage to any of the disc I'm just not pleased that I had to trash the spindle cover.
5,Quality blank DVD's,This is my third spindle of the Verbatim disks and I've only had one coaster using my NEC burner. These are quality blank dvd's that I would highly recommend.
2,Buyer Beware!,"Beware of all the glowing reviews that you see here; note that the best reviews are several years older and they were written for an older and now higher priced product, #95102, and manufactured to high standards for Verbatim through Mitsubishi. These new disks, the 97460, have very similar packaging but that's where the comparison ends. They are manufactured for Verbatim by Ridata, a name synonymous with land fill and have a high coaster rate. I got suckered once before I did my homwork, and buy the 95102s elsewhere and at a lower price."
4,Verbatim DVD-R Purchase,I was very satisfied with my purchase. I have purchased a lot of things online but never DVDs. The cost was great and I have not had any problems with the product. I was concerned about damaged or defective DVDs but that has not been an issue. I checked out previous reviews on this product and they were positive and very helpful. I would definitely purchase Verbatim DVDs again through Amazon. -- Sandee from Indy
5,These are dvds,and they record movies what a revelation.Really though verbatim is a good brand i would recommend this to anyone.
5,"Good price, reliable, as fast as advertised","I've only used 10 or so of these, but I was able to burn 16x (I think it achieved almost advertised speeds, if I remember correctly), and all 10 disks played great in my DVD player without skipping. Plus, a good price for 50 dvd-r's."
2,to many failures,I tried these Verbatim blank dvds to compare them to a another brand I purchased previously. It turned out to be a bad decision. Almost 30 out of the 100 dics failed to burn correctly. That would mean a 70% success rate and a 30% failure rate. To me that is unacceptable.
5,Excellent Buy,"I have not tried inscribing the discs, but the price is excellent and Verbatim are always reliable. I highly recommend these discs!!"
4,Warming purchase,"I'm quite happy with this purchase, just what I was looking for. Timely delivery, good quality.The only minor detail is that colors aren't as vivid as I had imagined, but taking into account the fabrics used in this article I should've pictured this.Even with this, I'd buy it again."
4,Wish the screen was easier to read,"I especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen. It has a contrast adjustment, but it not very helpful. It also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. A great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast."
4,Great Fun,If you love crosswords you will love this handheld.Buy the case for easier handling.The touchscreen option is a lot easier than the button type crosswords.
2,NY Times Deluxe Crossword,"Mixed low review- The single biggest negative is the contrast/brightness level of the screen, which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions. Unfortunately, that is a huge Achilles heal. Otherwise, great electronics, features, and stylus operation. I would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could be a deal breaker (unless there is something wrong with mine, which I doubt, I would not buy this again)"
4,olde tyme religion,"this is death metal. you need look no further. from the sludgy production to the densely twisted riffage, from the jackhammer drumming to the sepulchral growls, everything that defines the genre is right here. there is a feral intensity to this work that turns bones to dust and drives sane men mad. so much for the music. I like two other things about this. first of all, the apocalyptic and almost cosmic nihilism of the lyrics. second of all, the picture on the back. these thin young men in jeans and torn t-shirts are starkly real. I find the fact that they pooled their desperate alienation to make this particular music inspiring. As brutal and esoteric as this disc is, as uncompromising and unsentimental, there is something in it that points the way to redemption. By building an effigy to the forgotten, Suffocation strangely succeeds at offering hope to the hopeless."
5,One of the best of all time,"This is one of the best death metal albums I have ever heard. For some reason this band never got the respect they deserved. Forget crappy Cannibal Corpse. These no frills little guys put forth way more brutality then dressed up fakes such as Slipknot or all the black metal bands. These guys can really play their instruments. The drumming of Mike Smith is simply phenomenal. He belongs in the same category as a Sandoval, Lombardo, or Hoglan. Cerrito and Hobbs create some awesome riffs that will have you thrashing in no time. Although largely undecipherable Mullens voice adds to the rhythm of the song and is like another instrument. Unlike other...bands like Cannibal Corpse the lyrics are much more intelligent and varied. This is a technical masterpiece that should be in the collection of every death metal -no let me take that back-every metal fans collection."
2,"""Huh, I don't think so...""","Extremely boring, lame and overrated... that's what I think of when I hear the word ""Suffocation"". While I don't think they ever were abysmally bad, they just don't deserve all the praise they're getting even after all those years. Tell me, why would anybody really, REALLY wanna listen to this... I mean, it's so repetitive and boring. Every Song sounds the same..."
4,"sort of repetitive, but good","""Effigy of the Forgotten"" is a hard-hitting, technically precise album that those who are still new to to death metal (as I am) can enjoy pretty easily. The songs here are unquestionably brutal, with extremely tight and guttural growls backed up by crushing riffs and drums, occasionally augmented by a whipping guitar solo. Although, as I alluded in my title, this album can get a repetitive in that all the songs are rather similar, there are just enough instrumental wrinkles and tempo shifts to keep things from getting boring. So if you like death metal that's technically tight but not overly complex, you can't go wrong with ""Effigy."""
5,"...my destiny has only begun, to torture future minds...","...No words necessary here for this one...An essential and defining moment in early DM history...Considered by some (and rightly so) to be the origin and blueprint of brutal tech death...A jewel in the crown of extreme music and many a fan's favorite...Never to be surpassed in the minds of some...If you're familiar with EOTF, then you know of what I write...To fans of the extreme music genre who have since remained uninitiated, align yourselves with the glory that is Effigy of the Forgotten..."
4,"intelligent, sensitive film art","The short films on this DVD all express the sensitive and intelligent sensibility of the filmmaker. The writing is ironic, poetic and evocative. The visual control is assured and expressive. These are shorts that you will want to watch again many times, as they have multiple meanings, and provide a lasting pleasure to the viewer."
1,A Personal Trainer's Perspective,"I purchased this video to help me train clients who are interested in improving their fitness for golf. Unfortunately, for me it was a waste of money. The video presented what I am doing with my clients already. I was looking for more in-depth discussion of the muscles involved in the swing and how to train the body as a whole to prepare for golf season. Instead, the video presented 10 stretches and exercises that i have my clients working on already.Perhaps this video might be of some use to a non-professional looking for some stretches and rudimentary exercises. However, as a personal trainer, I was disappointed in the content."
1,THIS DVD IS FAKE,PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. WHEN i GOT THIS DVD AND i PLAY THE DVD CAME OUT TO BE CLEANING COMPANY EQUIPMENT. THE DVD IS FAKE IT IS NOT GOLF PROGRAM IT LIE. TAKE THIS ADVICE DO NOT BUY IT.
1,Save your money!!!!!!!!,"It stinks! It's been 7 months since I own it, and it's already been sent to repair two times (over two months!!!!) Slow, heavy, you can't shoot a photo unless using both hands, no vibration, distorted sounds,... It has even hanged the way windows does!!! Save your money: don't ever tell no one warned you."
3,Uncomfortable Monte Carlo Club Chair,I like the looks but dislike the comfort of the seat. The foam is too soft and does not offer good support. I would have returned this had my wife not thrown the box. :( not to mention it's really has bulky packaging. i will hesitate to recommend this to anybody.
1,Don't waste your money!,This is the worst video and information I have ever seen! The information on this video is an insult to the price of it. I have never seen anything worst then this! You will learn more about short selling from your dog or cat. The work-book that comes with it is salt in the wound.
4,Emma says....,"it's a very good book but it needs more details about other places. I really liked the postcards because they looked so real. If I was going to places, I would write postcards to my friends.Signed, E.J.W."
5,Wonderful,"I love this book. I found it many yrs ago and read it to second graders when I volunteered in the classroom. Now I read it to my grandkids. It is wonderful. When I finish reading it I ask the kids what they learned. My answer is ""if you read books you can go anywhere and do anything."" Great book for all ages."
3,Okay story,"Not my favorite Tara Janzen novel. Have read most of her other works and this one didn't come close. I have started and stopped reading it several times, it just didn't draw me in."
3,Good story line,"Good story line, but the book kind of drags. Seems like a lot of filler to make it longer. For the most part, I enjoyed reading it though."
