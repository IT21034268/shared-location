2,another plain ol' can opener,"This was described as the type of opener that cuts the whole top of the can off at the seal, leaving a nice burr-free edge; simply not true. It's just a plain ol' opener, costing twice as much as others, penetrating the top in the same old way, and not doing a very good job at that. I've opened a few cans with it and it never finishes the cut, always leaving at least one little unwanted ""hinge"" which I have to remove with my Leatherman can opener tool. It is not ergonomically ""cool"" either.It's just expensive.Amazon cheerfully and quickly gave me a refund on it."
1,Not a recommend...,"Opens cans fine but it would be a lot more helpful to have the instructions in English, instead of picture hieroglyhics so I could figure out how it REALLY works. Total waste."
1,Outsorced to China,"Made in China. Another good product that a company doesn't care enough about to make in their own country to maintain quality control and support it's citizens, but only their greed. Don't buy it. You can see that it's made in china by visiting their website and looking at the instructions pdf download on the bottom left corner. Terrible state of affairs that we live in."
3,Just Meh,You've got to rotate the can opener in order to grab the metal with the magnet; this means the top still falls into the contents of the opened can. My wife can't get the hang of using it at all; she still reaches for the low-tech can opener in the drawer. Ok but not a holy-grail can opener by any means.
5,Very Good for Arthritic Hands,"I have had issues with every other opener, but this one really works for me. My arthritis is making it more and more difficult to manage jobs like opening cans...this opener is a blessing."
4,Great Product,"Great product, if this is the type of opener you prefer. Well manufactured, easy to turn, have wrist problems, but is I can turn with no problem. Read all past review's I can add they were correct. Great product."
5,Great can opener. Highly recommended.,"I bought this after I had bought a more expensive Oxo can opener. I had to return the Oxo because it didn't work. This one is great. It opens cans effortlessly. Love the green color, too."
5,Awesome!!,"Best can opener I've ever owned. So easy! Clips onto the can, nice ergonomic rubber handle that makes it so easy to open any can of tuna, salmon, chic peas or whatever is on the menu!"
5,Love it.,Was a great performance. Loved it from start to finished. Saw it on TV and had to have it as my own.
4,Thurgood,I saw part of this stage drama on HBO a must it have for my collection. It was great to hear and see a superb depiction of a great legal adovocate for equal justice and civil rights. Mr Fishburne protrayed Justice Marshall is manner that gave life to the legal reasonings of great minds to utilize the essence of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to obtain the basic freedoms and access upon which our Nation was founded for Black Americans. Definately looking forward to purchasing a copy.
3,Disappointing.,"I am a history teacher who loves this subject, however I was at times bored. This film is in the style of a quasi-documentary, as Laurence Fishburne (who does a fine job of acting) talks about Marshall's life in the style of a filmed lecture before an audience. I don't think this would keep the attention of a high school audience and for those very knowledgeable about the subject you may be disappointed with some of the glossed over and missing details in his lecture. They take some Hollywood liberties with some details though it is presented more like a factual documentary."
2,You can do better than this,Used it once. Just not a good option. Go to a brick & mortar store and try out different brackets. This one didn't work for me.
2,Yellow Okidata Drum shipped new defective,The yellow drum ordered was shipped in a condition known as NEW-DEFECTIVE.The vendor was notified and a refund was very quickly provided when the drum was returned.This is very unusual to find a Okidata Drum in this condition but the vendor was very quick to remedy the situation.The refund was provided because the vendor did not have a replacement in stock. I appreciate his method of handling of this transaction.
5,The Flapper Wife,"Gift to friend who has read this author before. If you are interested in this time period, it is a fun book to have."
2,Its just not a fun CD,"Not sure what happened here... these guys had such momentum with their second album, and its as if someone stole their mojo. Its no surprise that this genre died out to grunge, because all the good bands of this era started to lose their edge. Sad really, Id rather have bought something else."
2,3 Is Third Best,"Firehouse departed from their formula with this release. Under pressure from Grunge or whatever, they only put three, what I'll call ""true to their roots"" tracks, on the album.Here For You, No One At All and I Live My Life For You are very good melodic tunes. I Live My Life For You is absolutely great and is one of my favorite ballads. The other stuff is just not as fun as before on Firehouse (debut) and Hold Your Fire."
3,Different Direction,"I'm not quite sure what Firehouse was after with this release. While not an about face or a surrender to the changing times (1995/Grunge, etc.), it is nonetheless a departure for the band. Gone is the less serious, crank it up and party sound so much enjoyed on the first two albums. Instead, we have a cautious turn towards a more serious sound. What remains is a CD that is in the middle of somewhere, with no songs staying with you. As usual the band does provide some excellent musical arrangements and it is always evident that Firehouse are professional musicians. A needed addition for the Firehouse fan but if you are looking to get to know the band, try their self-titled debut; one of the best Rock CD's of the '90's."
3,Leaves water reddish,"I purchased this because the price was good. I also heard that the ""crisps"" leave less fish poop. However, I notice that it makes the tank water reddish. I much prefer the water to be clear."
2,Disappointing for this reader,"I have to say I was disappointed in this book which I thought had a lot of promise. I loved the first chapter, and after that it went downhill quickly. Like the previous reviewer, I didn't get the relationship between the gay couple of Jack and Stuart, and I found the character of Jack completely unsympathetic. Why would anyone want to befriend him much less be in a relationship with him, or read another 300 pages about him. The character of Flynn is tragic, and why any kind of treatment for her is only attempted once when she's being cared for by a healthcare professional is beyond me. To give the author credit, despite the fact I kept complaining about the book to my partner, she did keep me intrigued enough to finish it...if only to see if one more piece of misery was going to be heaped onto the main character's life."
2,average,considering the family history i was hyped.but aside from Anything&Why with their Uncle&The King Of Pop Michael Jackson there's nothing really special here.vocally they haven't developed there own thing yet.but i will keep an ear out on them.cuz The Jackson Family is the real deal.
3,Good group,This CD is enjoyable but much of their music sounds the same - even the speed and harmony on different songs sounds the same. This one does have a couple of good songs.
2,don't buy it just because of michael,"The only good songs are Why and I Need You which features michael, and Anything and 24-7. So if you liked the released singles, just stick to those but the album as a whole is nothing special. They have talent and are gorgeous guys but the songs did nothing for me, stick to michael's music instead."
5,This album is incredible,"Old school, new school synth electro pop with vocals. Cute, dark, funny, and totally amazing!!!"
5,Probably the best book on the side of hockey we seldomly see,"Not only is it an insightful look at the intimidating Soviet hockey program, but a lesson in Russian culture as well. This was an easy read, cover to cover; I was engrossed in reading about the spy-novel style in which players were coaxed into defecting from their native land in order to pursue the NHL dream. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a love for the sport of hockey or Russian culture"
4,Being grateful,"Many North Americans do not realize how good their lives are, and a hockey player found out what a priviledge it is to live in these prosperous times. Tod's journey to Russia to learn more about the sport he wanted to excel is more than he expected. He sees what makes Russia work, how its people feel, and how hard life can be. To escape that life, he sees how hockey may be the way out for a very select few and even though conditions look to be miserable, life goes on. We are taken through this journey with Tod and I for one am all the more thankful to be living where I do. Life is hard, but the people he is with make the best of it, and it is that quality of the Russian people that makes this book intriguing."
1,get the record straight,I`m sorry to say that the real story of the first American to play hockey in the ussr should not be aboutTod Hartje but Bill McCormack.
1,Poor production control.,I tried two copies of this disk on four different manufacturer's DVD machines and both disks on all four machines gave unable to load error messages. Only time this has happened before and since amongst hundreds of DVDs.
4,love it!,"I've watched this film 5 times since I got it! You just gotta love a bunch of infighting satanists and druggies chasing each other around a small town in Ontario Canada in the snow. Great dialog, actors and story line. It starts out a little slow but then it quickly starts to surprise you! Favorite movie I've seen this year! Plus a cameo by dude who played Max Hedrom."
5,Best body lotion I've tried,"After 2 weeks of almost daily use, this lotion removed the small bumps on my upper arms and made the skin on my whole body soft and smooth. If I use ti every day, it irritates my sensitive skin slightly, so I use a different lotion--whatever's on sale at the drugstore--2 to 3 days per week. For someone who doesn't have sensitive skin, this might be fine every day. I use it on my hands once a day, right before bed.Since glycolic acid exfoliates the top layer of skin, I always wear sunscreen on my hands and any part of my body exposed to the sun (I do that anyway, regardless of this lotion) and avoid this lotion the day before prolonged sun exposure (e.g. going to the beach)."
2,Unpleasant scent & Sticky skin,"This product may or may not do what it claims, I'll never know, since I don't want to use it. It has an unpleasant scent, and though it does go on smoothly, it leaves my skin feeling sticky to the touch. I feel like it was a waste of money. Very unpleasant."
2,REALLY SMALL,"My husband and I were hoping to use these in our new baby's nursery; however, when they arrived, they were really small. I'd say each fish is about the length of a baby carrot. Pretty expensive for something so tiny, so we returned it."
5,Outstanding!,"A painfully detailed, yet literary, volume of one Marines' experiences in the war and its immediate aftermath. The reader is there with Bill through it all. An iconic combat veterans tale. A must read for those seeking a perspective on the mud of the war."
4,Good reference material.,"I am very interested in photography, especially fetish fashion style photography. I found this book to be a great reference source for information about photographers in this field. Now this isn't one of those slick, flashy, fetish style books, it's full of B&W and toned images. One of the best things about this book is that there is a paragrah or so about each photographer, their style, or some other interesting facts and information about them. From this book I was able to get some good ideas of photographers that I liked and with their names I was able to in most cases find more of their work on the internet (a bit better way of searching, as opposed to entering fetish photos in a search engine)."
4,nice useful refernt book,"i bought this book to be used as referent for nude drawing, and as such, i't proven to be very useful, a lot of very good quality photos, in black and white (all you color lovers, this is deffenetly not the book for you, though i love my erotics black and white, so i'm happy with that), pretty good level of print and reproduction which is also nice, and a good format, small and thick, so i can carry it around in by backpack and not just keep it on the bookshelf. it is a good introduction to nude photographers, some erotic, some artisitic, some more fashion oriented. and it's a good way to start if you know you are interested in nude photography and don't really know what you like....also, a technical problem, due to the format, the paperback cover's not holding out too well, and though it's not falling a part or anything (so far!) it's not exsactly the perfect solution to it."
2,The Mammoth Book of Illustrated Erotica,"I think the photographs are well done, but I just do not like the book and wish I hadn't bought it."
2,Not Another One!,"How many more 'histories of nude photography' can be produced without depleting the national ink reserves which will certainly result in books, such as Lady Chatterly's Lover, never again being printed? This book is a thick-as-a-brick collection of images that questions why anyone would want to collect such things. Because most of these images are old does not make them any more interesting and, in some ways, enables the 'reader' to chastise the past as 'no better' than the present in its appetite for low-bar imagery. Fortunately, historical revisionism does not fare well in the art world. Thumbing through this edition left me searching for any redeemable value beyond relief after placing it back on the shelf. As an alternative to this garbage, I suggest supporting photographers currently working in this genre; Saudek, Sturges, and so forth. Ok, the book is cheap and if you don't have one of these monocular anthologies, I suppose this one is as good, or bad, as all the others."
1,So Boring,"This book had the blandest, most boring deliverance of a well-known Shakespearean story, Twelfth Night. This author not only couldn't come up with an original plotline, but she can't write much better than at a 5th grade level. I finished it to the end just to see if it would get better, but it didn't- just a continuing farrago of cliches and predictable plot turns. The dialogue was like a droning litany. Don't even bother with this- it's awful."
5,I liked it,I liked. It. Very interesting. I read with my lit circle group at school. It was very fun to try to figure put what would happen next!
5,Very entertaining,"Enjoyed the book. Will be interesting to see how the main character, Charlie, is developed.Very similar premise of other magic themed books (which ultimately leapt successfully to the big screen) so might be considered a bit stale, but all-in-all, a decent way to have your young tween to spend a weekend. (There are some dark themes, so perhaps appropriate for only tween readers? But if they read & enjoyed the HP novels, should be no problem).Would def recommend this author & series!"
1,not quite what I expected,"After acouple of hours of use I took it off! It became to heavyand awkward to use, the arm bar makes it difficult to operate the lens, for the cost, I think the design needs serious improving."
3,This Product os OK,"The Stroboframe Pro-RL Rotary Bracket does it's job, but is very heavy, and does not provide a lock to keep the camera in the portrait position. This is not the best situation, because the camera can easily shift it's position without warming."
3,"Good Textbook, But...","This book refers mostly to forensic, industrial and medical uses for infrared photography. Obviously a 31 year old textbook's references to specific emulsions are out of date. Even with those caveats it is an interesting book and nuggets of worthwhile info may be gleaned from its pages. I have to remember that not all photographers are in the fine art category and for the categories listed above this book is easily worth the money. Just think college textbook rather than ""Joy Of Photography"" and you will do fine."
5,congratulation,A very knowledgeable book. After reading it you'll have an excellent overview of GPRS. Mr. Heine uses a lot of pictures and tables which illustrates the informations very well.
2,Do not buy this,"It is obvious that Mr. Heine is knowledgalbe about GSM and GPRS. However this ""book"" does not come close to explaining the concepts of the GPRS technology. Much time, (and your money) are wasted on a review of GSM, which is covered very well in his previous book. I realize these are powerpoint slide reproductions but there is no effort made to include extra explainations as would be included in a well prepared powerpoint document. It seems as if Mr. Heine is trying to capitalize on the sucess of his prior GSM book by throwing this loose compilation of pages together and calling it a reference book."
4,Good Book On GPRS,"I read the editorial review, and I think this book is focused on the GPRS technical side, seems good for those who want to understand GPRS but not like to go over all the related ETSI standards."
3,Salsa Time,"The length is 20 minutes too long for a subject like this and the editing could have been crisper. However, credit to the director for etching each character well and giving them time to develop.It's not a never-done-before script but it has a freshness in the sense that in the last reel, the very place (pub) where everyone once enjoyed spending time at, after marriage they find it extremely boring. These guys did grow up!!!There are plenty of moments many will identify with, either whilst growing up as a teen, or whilst working, or when asking that very difficult question, 'Will you marry me?'"
2,A Strange Read,"The author writes beautifully, and the story itself is interesting and full of compelling characters. It is, however, at it's heart a novel about aliens landing in Portugal."
5,"One of Their Very Best, Plus Bonus Tracks!","Not clear on where the bonus cuts fall in the 5th Timeline--were they recorded for this album or at some other time? Doesn't quite sound like a 1974 effort in some spots. Every extra cut is a gem, and the whole album is terrific. I think Bones' cuts are fine but I do like the sort of edgier/R & B ""new"" sound that was being tried by Mr. Florez. Like a lot of 5th Music, if you have never heard the original (say, ""Harlem"") the 5th gives you a great intro to music you maybe never experienced before. So to me, ""Harlem"" is magnificent!I believe, though I can't be certain, that ""No Love"" has the distinction of being the only single the 5th released that has the Arista label. It looks like they weren't a priority in the Bell-Arista changeover.S & I was a terrific effort and a forerunner to the awesome ""Earthbound"" which we still await semi-patiently!Thanks to Mr. Florez for all the great behind-the-music commentary!"
4,Awesome hard to find,"This cd is really a collector's item! It's worth every penny and nowhere in any cd of the Fifth Dimension, can you find them singing Hardcore Poetry. Just when I thought only the Tavares sang it. Beautiful rendition!!! Awesome."
4,Let there be light,"I like this product. It could be slightly bigger, but I do like the portability. I think it makes some difference in my life. It's hard to tell I suppose. Shining a bright light in your eyes does help the waking up process though! Delivery was good. All the parts were there and in working order, so no complaints."
5,Works like a charm,This little device is a real benefit on long trips across multiple time zones. The light emitted helps overcome the time changes.
2,Nausea and vision problems,"I was optimistic about this product, especially given that I received a recommendation for Litebook from a psychiatrist, but this light did not work for me. The lights and reflectors are designed so that there is a very small area of light that is full power and it's difficult to find the exact position to gain the full benefit. It sort of feels like I'm aiming a flashlight at the edge of my range of vision. The intensity was too much for me. After using it, I was dizzy and nauseated for the entire day and felt that my vision was off too. I tried varying amounts of time, but it just didn't work for me - too many complications and they're so severe that I can't justify trying to build up a tolerance to the light. Maybe something with a wider field of light will be more effective for me. Sending it back!"
5,exactly what i wanted,"i spent a lot of time looking at different sites to find what i wanted for a xmas gift for my daugther. amazon had the best price. when my daugther receive it, it turned out to include all the cords, chargers, and instructions that were needed but not mentioned as being included. i took a chance with amazon and they came thru. my daugther loves the Litebook elite hand-held! she lives in Minnesota and needed the light to lift her mood. so far we haven't been able to tell if it has but just having such a convenient device that she can use at work in her ""cube"" or take in her briefcase when she goes on business trips has lifted her mood."
2,Size problem,"The shoe looks great just like the picture. No problem with them getting it to me, however, its so narrow that there couldn't possibly be enough shoe horns to make it fit a human foot. I went back to look for a wide width of the same shoe to no avail. This shoe is shipped from Bealls in Florida. They said I could return it to the store. I live two states away! The best I could get is a shipping label to avoid return charges. If your foot is less than an inch wide, this is your shoe."
3,Skechers Slip-On,I have to say they are comfortable once you get them on but getting them on your feet is not an easy task initially. They are not very bendable and I couldn't get them on initially. I really wish I had bought the open back Skechers.
3,ouch I feel like Cinderella,"My local store ran out of these shoes so I went to another one and they were out too. So I looked online and found these. They are just a pinch too small. It is taking me like forever to break them in. My old shoes were ripping apart. It has been a week or two and they seem better. I wish I could have tried them on and gotten a pair half a size bigger. Otherwise, these are great shoes. I love not ever having to tie them. I like the heel too in that they make me taller. Shipping was quick and everything was nice."
1,Sketchers Slip ons,"I agree with Mary M. Young, I can hardly get these things on. They are soooo stiff!"
5,Very cute,"I've somehow have always loved this cute cartoon, I had it on VHS and decided to get it on DVD. I highly recommend it for children."
4,good movie for chrismas,i liked this movie and im an adult.my daughter has watched this movie over and over again.its really a great family movie.
3,Carnival...in the Port of Veracruz...,"""Noche de Carnaval"" (""Carnival Night"") from 1984, was a social-drama about exploited dock workers standing up for their rights, set against the backdrop of carnival-time in the port of Veracruz. It also had a subplot of a washed-up dancer who had seen better days - Ninon Sevilla (the great Cuban import, whose heyday was in the 1950's). The film had a strong cast of actors like - Manuel Ojeda, Carmen Salinas (playing her wise-cracking self), Sergio Ramos, Rebeca Silva, Jose Carlos Ruiz, Tina Romero, etc., etc., but it was lacking a stronger script and clearly-defined direction. There was a catfight between Ninon Sevilla and Rebeca Silva that was more akin to a sex-comedy, than for a melodrama that was striving for sociopolitical relevance. Most people outside of Mexico, would not be familiar with the background to the film anyway. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 90 mins. The DVD picture quality by 'Tekila Films' was very good.Love and Peace,Carlos Romero"
5,Worth every penny!!!!!,"I was skeptical in spending a little more for this tri-pod because I didn't think there was a difference in any of them. But I totally do not regret buying it I have received complements on it and inquiries. Spend your money on this it will make you job a lot more easier, I record my daughter's dance performances and they are at a variety of locations indoors and out and this tri-pod is able to adjust to the surrounding and give me a perfect shot at my daughter performance!!!"
4,me,Enjoying the use of this tripod with all kinds of wonderful features. The only drawback i have had so far is the tripod does not keep its position when i put my telephoto lense on it. Seems too heavy for the plastic fasteners to tighten enough to hold.
4,its value for money,"I am quite happy with this one, its definite value for money. Have to be careful with the flimsy knobs. (Even product label also has the same warning)"
5,No problems whatsoever,"I cant say that I use it everyday, but when I do it gives me no problems at all. this tripod has a lot of features and i like it. Very good for it's price!"
1,WAY too flimsy for even a Panasonic DMZ-5,"Read all the reviews as I needed a tripod for taking decent, square to the horizon pix of wife's artwork for her portfolio and hand held pix did not cut it. Sounded as tho this was stable enough for this undertaking, but it is sooooo limber as to make it unusable for my purposes. I will say that one reason to buy locally is to put hands on to evaluate. Amazon is good on returns (as evidenced by the prior purchaser's somewhat amateur repackaging) but keep in mind that your order MIGHT be someone else's return.... of a return."
4,great tripod,"shopped around Amazon for awhile trying to find a good tripod and ended up with this targus digital. this was a great buy, very sturdy for the price, durable, light weight, holds my nikon d3100 just fine."
5,PetGuard Herbal Collar for Cats,PetGuard Herbal Collar for Cats are great. I've been using them for years on all my cats. Never have any of my cats contracted fleas or any other nasty bugs. The odor of the collar is most pleasant to me and the cats seem to be happy also. Would not use any other product.
3,"This made my cat smell great, but fleas remained.","Before I tried this collar, we tried a regular chemical one. That one had an odor my wife and I both found unpleasant, so much so that we started avoiding our cat. Plus, the chemical collar did nothing to get rid of the fleas. So, we tried this one instead. It was better than the chemical one in one major way: it smelled terrific. Even now, after 2 months on the cat, it smells very nice. Unfortunately the fleas remained - we had to kill them with some pills. I do not know if this collar will prevent re-infestation, but it definitely did not get rid of existing fleas. One other disadvantage is that there is no safety release, which makes me a little worried."
3,"Smells great, not sure if it really works","The collar smells great, and makes myself and guests really happy to pick up my cat, but I have limited awareness of the effectiveness.I used it in conjunction with some 4 month flea and tick medicine and the results have been great. Would one work without the other? I don't know.However, it smells great, and it sure doesn't hurt."
2,questionable item,Item did not come as photoed! Item came in a small box (matchbox sized) in a useless stamped tin holder. My holder wouldn't close and allowed the bits to fall out of the box when I opened it.Most of the bits seem ok but one of them was bent and there were 2 sets that were the same size (so only 18 different sizes instead of 20). for only $8 its not a bad deal but don't expect something amazing here
2,Bare little book,"Not much to say about this book. Through drawings, it demonstrates three Long Fist forms. The drawings are very clear, and there are arrows (solid for the left side of the body, dotted for the right side) that show where the body will move for the next move. There are no applications, no demonstration of the basics, just three forms, but they are shown in a manner which makes them easy to follow and learn."
3,Not what I wanted,"Because the on-line account of this paper was very limited, the article was not what I wanted. It is on marketing of social change -- how to get the public to adopt things such as recycling or cancer screening. I was hoping for an article on improving the performance of Boards of Directors in non-profits (such as the book ""Doing Good Better""). The Amazon listing also did not say that the article is from 1996, so it is dated."
4,Fun!,"The book was fun, light, endearing and most enjoyable! Mike's parents are cute characters that I can envision in my own family! In addition to the book as it is, I would have liked to hear a bit more detail about the trip itself, and their stop overs.(And any interesing incidents!) All in all, it's a fun story, and I wish I traveled with them!"
2,Gets old real fast......,"I've had this book for some time, and finally read it because I ""knew"" it would be great. Well, it wasn't. I am not familiar with the author, but the reviews for the book were so good, and yes, he appears to be a funny man. However, reading about his RV trip with his parents and grown kids (WHY did they go??) became a one-note show very quickly. His mother swears and is afraid of everything. His father sings, sometimes the great funny old songs, nauturally wearing the uniform of the old man. The only sights that interest them on their trip through the US are the Office Depots and Walmarts; they go wild with excitement when they see one. His kids are barely noticeable. They drive on and on and the author quotes the continuous witticisms from his parents. It gets old very quickly. I skimmed the last two-thirds of the book and put it in my very short stack of books to give to the library. Very disappointing. To me, at least."
2,A little bit heartwarming but a lot of tedious reading.,"It started off good. I liked Mike's parents and they were quirky like most people's parents so I got a few chuckles about the things they said. But this is a generally ordinary family and not much exciting happens on this road trip, at all. I kept waiting for something to happen. So soon I felt like it got pretty dull with the day to day conversations you would have in your own house about your own relatives. It was a bit mundane and not as interesting to me as I think it was to them. I felt like there just wasn't enough material here for a book. Maybe you have to be a fan of Mike on the Today show, which I don't watch, to get into this."
4,A better ride than on TV,"The PBS series based on this memoir is entertaining, but the book is so much more. It's poignant, it's deeper, and it's much, much funnier -- laugh out loud finny. Marge and Jack emerge in the book as three-dimensional people, not just the target of jokes that the TV version focuses on. You'll also learn heart-rending details of their childhoods, the pervasive sadness that both have coped with, and you'll understand why Mike Leonard thinks he leads a charmed life."
5,Outstanding and Inspirational,"From the very first pages, I laughed out loud!! I smiled the whole time I was reading. What a great idea and journey. I have heard Mike Leonard speak and he is such an inspiration for all of us ""to NOT fear failure"". What a special person and great family man."
4,The Ride of Our Lives,"This was a fun read. It was witty, yet had many personal messages. The story took place in my hometown, so it was fun remembering various activities that he wrote about. This family would be a great one to include in ""my circle of friends."""
4,The ride of our lives,"A good quick read. The book is funny,sad,and so much like most of our lives. The family is a say it like it is. We are just as we come take us or leave us. I would take them, read the book it was very enjoyable."
2,The Ride of our Lives,"I read this book hoping that it would be an exciting trip around the United States, full of adventure, and about the closeness of a family. It was not bad in those respects, but I had a great let-down when I got into the reading. I had to stop reading it because the language was so raw. The unfortunate grandma had not learned to express herself in a dignified, modest manner. It was very offensive."
2,"Pleasant reading, but a little pointless.","I think this book was a little too personal to be widely interesting to a large readership. The writing style was pretty good, and there are a lot of pretty funny incidents. But, in a way, it was easy to put it down and forget to pick it up again. I had to read it for my book club (and paid for the book!) or I probably would have set it aside and picked up something more compelling.Still, if anyone is feeling especially nostalgic about their family or would like to take a family road trip one day, this book has something to offer. More so, if you have an interest in Mike Leonard's family. His mother was my favorite character."
1,An anti-valentine,"Why Mike Leonard should choose to portray his parents like this flies in the face of common sense. Dysfunctional families can be lots of fun, but the Leonards seem kinda . . . mirthless, I guess. And boring. I remember enjoying their home-video broadcasts on the Today show, so I'm assuming Leonard is better with a camera than he is with a keyboard. Midway through the book, I realized I genuinely didn't enjoy spending time with these people."
5,Good stuff!!,"Yes what can I say this stuff is pure plant based goodness and we love them!! I give them to my 12 year old and I also take them and we are never sick!! The are wonderful but you still have to eat a healthy diet of organic fruits and veggies!! Oh and take your omega 3's and probiotics everyday and you will be feeling great!!! The recommended dose is 6 a day so we have 2 at breakfast, 2 at lunch and 2 at dinner :-) Enjoy!!"
3,"Too much sweet, not enough cherry.","I bought this for my husband because he wanted to make Italian sodas, or at least mock Italian sodas, with it. Unfortunately, the stuff just tastes like red sugar water. I'm sure hummingbirds would love it, but it's not exactly what we had in mind. If it had a bit more (a lot more, really) cherry flavor, then it'd be fine - obviously it's supposed to be sweet!"
5,Simply incredible...,"I was 19 when this album came out in 1981 - back then it was some of the freshest music I had ever heard - now that I am 40, it's STILL some of the freshest music I have ever heard. These guys are genius, and their early music has melodies and electronics that are so beautiful that some of the songs make me feel so good I almost cry. Their sound is like no other artist, before or after them. If you like this album, you MUST get ""Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark"" and ""Organisation"". BRILLIANT."
2,"Okay for Huckle Fans - a review of ""Huckle Cat's Colors""","This small book would not be one that I would expect babies to like. The artwork is busy and I'm not sure that a even a toddler would get the humor. For example, for the color green, there is a picture of Mr. Frumble's pickle car, also an overturned tanker truck that is pouring spinach out onto the road. [Okay it's not funny to me either, but you know how preschoolers are.]Also, I'm not sure how many babies and younger toddlers would know the characters from Richard Scarry stories. Older toddlers and preschoolers who need to learn their colors, however, might like the book.Two Stars. [C-]. A bit busy for babies. However, if your child is a Scarry fan you might try it."
1,find another vendor,The vendor sent it poorly packaged and I received it damaged. The return postage was too costly so I kept the item at my expense..
1,Not genuine Dyson - made by SpareSaver,"Very upset to receive this item and find that it is not ""by Dyson"" as the listing says. It is actually made by SpareSaver - a name not mentioned anywhere in the item description or details. I will be returning this right away. It may be a great alternative to the expensive Dyson-made filter but that's not what I wanted. This will be my first return to Amazon due to an inaccurate listing. I called Dyson and ordered a genuine part immediately. This is an expensive vacuum and I don't want to mess around."
5,Amazon does everything better,Nothing but a run around from Dyson and several other stores that you would think would quickly ship this item. Amazon shipped it in one day and my vacuum was back in service.
1,"This doesn't fit, we must acquit","This product is a ""Dyson original components"" based on the label but I doubt it now. It does NOT FIT a Dyson DC15 as it is too small in diameter and also has a tab/fin sticking up on the plastic (opposite of foam) side. Shame, shame on this vendor for these errors.There are 2 labels on the bag it came in. One says DC07/14 HEPA POST FILTER PART NO. 901420-02The other label on top says Dyson DC07,DC14, DC15 POST HEPA FILTER NEWWell, as I said above, this does NOT fit for a DC15. Not sure if it was incorrectly labeled or there is a spec error, but I do know this: Back it goes ..."
1,This is not a Dyson filter,"This is not a Dyson branded filter, even though it is advertised multiple times as a Dyson branded filter. It does the job and fits in my Dyson vacuum so I did not return it, but is not what I paid for and quite frankly I was overcharged for this generic/flimsy/no-name filter. It is not even the same color as the photo. Do not buy."
1,Absolutely terrible. Does not fit my vacuum at all.,I have a Dyson DC14 and ordered this filter as a back up. IT does not fit my Dyson AT ALL. Don't waste your money.
1,Does not Work as Advertised - Does not fit the DC14,Title says it all. It will not fit the DC14. I would NOT recommend this product.
2,opens to 55? NOT!,At max this umbrella opens to 48-50.Craftsmanship is quite cheap and definitely won't fit for midwest summer storms.
5,Good!,"I was surprised for the quality of the product, a fun game for my daughter, easy to install and hours of fun. Shipping was fast as usual in Amazon."
1,don't buy for the 30d,"I have the stroboframe and their site said to buy this plate for the 30d (no battery grip). I think it would be wiser to throw your money in the street, perhaps getting pictures of people chasing the bills."
1,Wrong part,This is the wrong part. Nowhere did it state that there were different parts for different models. The photo showed 4 pieces and I figured I would receive all 4 and 1 would work. Its useless to me.
1,Big Book edition is black instead of blue!!!!,"I have an old hardcover edition that my students enjoy, but they enjoy a felt board version that I made even more because it was easier for all of them to see. So I was very glad to see this classic come out in a Big Book edition. However, it was SO disappointing when I received my Big Book and saw that the background was black in this edition rather than the blue background in my small hardcover. Which is true to the original?A blue background helps preschoolers connect the dots between this book and watching clouds in the real sky. And the picture on the Amazon site shows the book as blue, too. Skip this Big Book and stick to using a felt board, teachers."
4,Not Bad,"To start off, this is a great drum pad. I am 15 years old, and been drumming since 4th grade. I do have a full drum set, but this is PERFECT for rudiments, warming up, and practice. It is very quiet, but not silent. I have two sisters, and this gets 5 stars from them for noise! The bounce is very realistic, and feels great. I ordered the 12in pad, and it is small, but not too small. I love this product. Thanks! Hope this helped.--Matt"
3,"Very basic, but works","I thought this pad would be a little more than a slab of high-density particle board and a thin layer of wet-suit-like material, but it works well-enough for practicing drum rolls."
5,GREAT FOR BEGinners,"alright, so im new to drumming, and i thought to myself that i needed something to practice with that wont wake up my parents.so i bought this baby, the feeling is pretty similar to a snare drum, minus the fact that its rubber, it feels nice and sturdy, the rubber smell went away after a few days of usage. i also did not want something TOO big so because i planned on taking this around with me when i had to wait. and just whip it out and play, but its just perfect size, its not to big and definitely not too small. of course this review is coming from a total beginner, i have no experience with other brands or kinds, so i cant really tell you anymore than my first experience, but im highly satisfied."
3,Fibreboard?,"The pad is actually quite nice and the feel and rebound are good enough for practice. My only complaint is the use of bare, unfinished fiberboard for the base. This isn't a great choice for something that is going to get tossed around and whacked with wooden sticks. Using an alternative material like bamboo could have maintained the cost and provided a more durable and aesthetically pleasing product."
4,realfeel by evans apprentice pad,"I am pleased with the practise drum pad. It has a thick rubber pad which helps to reduce the sound of drum sticks hitting the surface of the pad. More importantly, not neglecting the practise experience.All in all, I am happy to receive his product."
4,PYLE MINI PA,"This is an impressive little unit for the price. I have not had time to audition the PWM-A600 in an actual meeting situation but I like the features and size. It offers both a wired and wireless microphone, the latter must be held about an inch from your lips which limits the system from picking up any other sound other than the speaker's voice. Otherwise my only reservation is that it doesn't have a great deal of volume though it boasts 100-Watt total output. There doesn't appear to be an allowance for an additional speaker either, so I would not recommend the A600 for large rooms or audiences but fine for meetings of up to about 70 people or so."
5,Great Value. It has been working well for our Rotary Club for months,"I looked into various PA systems for our Rotary club. We have a great PA built into a lecturen. But it was too heavy to move easily and it did not have the capacity for a wireless microphone. Our club was conflicted about buying a new PA system, when many cost $1000 on up. I found the Pyle PWM-A600 and read the reviews. It looked good for our purposes and the price was amazing, under $130! I found some other systems and sent the information to my board. Our techies liked the Pyle PWM-A600, so we decided to try it. It worked perfectly for a room with about 60 people. Both mikes are shielded on the sides, so you have to speak right into the center of the mike about one inch away. Sometimes the amp buzzes a bit then goes away. I bought a lavaliere mike at Radio Shack for $50 and it works well with it. It been great so far for these 3 months. Great buy!I Love You Madly! On Passion, Personality and Personal Growth, second edition"
1,1950's technology,"A heavy, shoe-box sized unit. Has a FUSE which was burned out. Old technology. Cumbersome. Didn't work. Sent it back."
1,Wireless mic cuts in and out even at 5 feet away,"Despite using new batteries, fully charging the unit, attaching the antenna, the wireless microphone cuts in and out repeatedly, even from just 5 feet away. Maybe this one is defective. My older Pyle Pro PWA500 worked great, but the microphone was better made, and transmitted on channel 49 and used a 9v battery. This newer unit transmits on a different frequency and this mic takes 2 AA batteries, so maybe has less power."
1,Doesn't hold up.,Had to send it to the factory after 2 weeks. Blade slips off. Retailer had same problem with the one they had.
5,This Is A Real Time Saver,"I have been using this for over a year. While the actual surface is normally adequate, I wish it were larger to accommodate bigger pieces of glass. However, in most instances it is really more than adequate.It is versatile and makes nice, clean cuts and is a true time saver. The base catches the tiny shards of glass which makes for a fast clean-up. Comes with a DVD that explains how to use the Taurus, but I did not watch it since I bought this after I had used my friend's Taurus which sold itself.This is a great tool for anyone who makes stained glass items."
4,"Good, but it will NOT plug into a standard outlet!","I picked this unit up to mount into my home audio rack. When I got it, I discovered that the plug end of this PDU is not a standard 3-prong plug. It's a NEMA 5-15R, which a quick wikipedia search translates to ""one blade horizontal, one blade vertical, and ground pin is round"". If you look at the photo you'll see the outlets are this configuration too.I ended up going to Home Depot and springing $13.99 for a NEMA 5-15 GFCI outlet, which was easy to install.Overall, I really like this PDU, but do note, if this is for home use, you likely will need to change the outlet you plug this into."
5,Jammin in Beauty!!,"The Mattel Jammin in Jamaica dolls are beautiful. They did a GREAT job with this series. I find it age appropriate for my six year old. The doll is properly dressed, and it's just so pretty. She loves the My Scene dolls, and the Jammin in Jamaica are just so fun and summerish! Very nice! It brings a 45 minute DVD I have no idea if it's a good movie or not, we haven't viewed it, it's a Christmas gift. I know they're teenagers( the dolls)so there might be some ""boy crazy"" stuff on it or whatever, but I'm pretty confident that it will be appropriate. I will watch it before my daughter does, of course, just to make sure."
5,Anyone interested in Occult History will love this Book!,To think that most of the modern world never takes the time to think this deeply or to read the real mysteries of our origin is mind boggling. THIS is a great book.
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a scientific survey of the emotions, but this is a literary and historical survey.The historical parts are very interesting but are, unfortunately, the smaller part of the book.The literary parts I had rather less patience with; they felt rather like amateur Freud, rambling on about (supposedly) univeral patterns of human behavior (where universal apparently means within the western literary tradition), and apparently quite ignorant of any post-WW2 brain science. (For example, how can one seriously discuss obsessive-compulsive disorder, as the book does, without even mentioning that drugs exist that quieten the malady?)"
5,Great,"For what it does it's great, no question. It's low profile and doesn't add that annoying height to the light stand / umbrella set-up. My flash is still aimed dead center of the umbrella with this. Clamp is solid too, a well constructed piece. Now, I made the stupid mistake of buying this one, with the bracket nut thingy, when I didn't need to. Buy the one without it if you only need the shoe and save your money."
3,Accessory shoe,I ordered two units with the same part number but I got two dissimilar units even though the bags were marked with the same part number. I guess they were cleaning out their shelves.This unit is designed such that it will not short out the pins on the bottom of a flash unit. This is a very attractive feature and works fine. Most shoes require the use of electrical tape to prevent this.
2,Don't spend the money!!,I really like Francine Rivers (Redeeming Love is my favortie book of all time) but this book is so short (read in less than an hour) and not much content or depth to it. Found it disappointing.
4,Great for reading aloud by the Christmas Tree,"This is a nice little book that takes 10-15 minutes to read aloud. The story itself is about a little boy named Timmy whose mother cannot take care of him, and God does take care of him. It may bring a little tear to your eye when you read it.I don't find the book particularly well written, but it is one of the favorite books of my 4-year-old. He would love for me to read it to him every night.This book also contains the story of the birth of Christ from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke plus a few shorter stories and Christmas recipes.If you are looking for a book to get your family in the Christmas spirit, this is a good one."
4,Very touching story . One to read every Christmas!,A fast read that if you could get past the lump in your throat would be an excellent book to read aloud to your children. A very touching story portrayed in a very down-to-earth way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a little altitude in their attitude.
5,Great short story,"I happen to like short stories, and this is a good one. The story is short, sweet, and moving, and I appreciated the personal touches the author added from her own life. If you want a good Christmas story to share with your family each holiday, I would highly recommend this one."
4,Good story!! Quick read!,"Francine Rivers is my favorite author! Read anything she writes!I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it kind of ends very suddenly for me, but it was good"
5,shoe box,"Haven't read the book yet, but it looks like it is in perfect condition.I trust Francine Rivers to write nothing but the best in Christian literature."
3,I didn't realize it was a short children's story with recipes.,"I'm a big fan of Francine Rivers, so I ordered this book, as I hadn't read it. It's a cute children's story with Francine's favorite Christmas recipes scattered throughout the book. I was expecting one of her wonderful Christian novels."
1,A let Down,I have been reading Francine Rivers books for over a year now. I was always eager to start the next book and at the same time sad to see the current one end. Her writing is so moving. The Shoe Box broke my bubble. It was such a let down after the others. It was so much of a disappointment I have yet to order another of her books. The story moved to fast with very little explaination of the characters. It seem to let you hang at the end. It never really explained why he chose the shoe box to hold his secrets. What led him to this. It is almost as if she rushed in her writing to meet a dead line. So much of the story seemed to be missing. The ending was good but the middle was missing.
2,A major disappointment,"The three works on this recording clearly put an emphasis on the clarinet playing, and Stoltzman's performance just doesn't cut it. He is OK for new age or crossover music, but he completely lacks depth and sound quality required to play serious works. If you have never heard these pieces played by anyone else, then you can still enjoy this CD, because all three performes play mostly in tune, and the recording quality is good.If you are more than just a beginner, I recommend listening to Anthony Gigliotti's or David Oppenheim's recordings."
4,"good playing, tone too bright","These are excellent pieces, all three of them, and these performers certainly do them justice. This recording should definitely be in your collection.I have one problem with it, however: Stoltzman's tone. His tone is just too shrill and reedy for my liking; I prefer a darker, less strident tone. I swear, his tone borders on buzzy sometimes. A good example of this is found in the first movement of the Brahms trio, between 0:55 and 1:13. He sounds like a kazoo. Most of the time, it's bearable, but I don't know what was going on here, because his other recordings don't suffer this problem. Maybe it's the A clarinet.I give the cd four stars, as opposed to three, because these players truly are virtuous in their playing, and they seem to understand the pieces very well. My favorite is the Brahms, with the Beethoven as a close second.Buy this CD if you're a classical music fan, but beware Stoltzman's tone."
2,Stoltzman? more like Sucksman,"I bought this CD on a whim, figuring ""with these musicians, it can't be bad!"" Well, it can.The biggest and most readily apparent problem is Stoltzman's clarinet playing. He gets so carried away in the more dramatic passages of this music that he throws restraint to the wind; he plays so aggressively in some sections, and with such shrill tone, that I occasionally cringe to listen to it.As for Ax and Ma, while their playing is perfectly good, they seem to have become infected by Stoltzman's rambunctiousness and at times the whole thing sounds like a three-way ego contest. Surely there must be better recordings of these pieces available.(Apparently, this recording won the 1996 Grammy for best chamber performance. Just goes to show that the Grammys have a lot more to do with whose name is on the cover than what's actually on the record.)"
2,Misinformed,"I will keep this short and sweet; something the movie was not.It states on the Amazon film page that this movie has a release date of 2010.That may be; however, it was produced and filmed in 1965 and has all the earmarks of a film of that time. Was it horrible? Back then, probably not. It might have even been a bit groundbreaking in a few of the parts. The lesbian fling was different for back then. But, all in all, for today, the movie was not worth my time to watch it. If you are a huge fan of back then movies, enjoy; otherwise, save your money."
5,A Well Written Story of a Fascinating Person,"Peggy Guggenheim brought abstract expression to the forefront of the art world. Behind the scenes, Guggenheim led a torrid, Bohemian existence, unrestrained by middle class conventions. Mary V. Dearborn captures the essense of of Peggy against the back drop of the art she helped to promote.Well written, easily readable, and thoroughly researched. Mistress of Modernism: The Life of Peggy Guggenheim is a must read for anyone who loves art, or just loves to read a good biography."
1,Mistriss of Moderism,Did not care for this style of narrative. Lots of information but very dry. Not an easy read.
2,A pitiful woman,"Peggy Guggenheim, a wealthy woman, had to buy friends and influence. She chose the path of modern art and subsidized young artists who couldn't turn down her generosity - and she slept with most of them. They gave her sex and a feeling of inclusion in the art world. Her two children came second to her desires to be noticed. Sad life, sad story."
3,pleasant diversion,"The characters aren't very well drawn, but the plot is good. An Adriatic cruise, a very nasty aunt, a couple of red herrings (American); plot at a standstill two-thirds of the way through -- & then everything unravels. A pleasant reading break."
1,Disspointed,"I can't beleave this is an outrage! the product isn`t even well packed, I don`t even know what it does, it doesn`t come with instructions, What does it do? I don`t know. What is it good for? Don`t Know. I feel robbed"
3,it's ok,Well i bought this toy and i thought it was going to be great well i was wrong it's not terrible but the hair kinda gets messed up but barbie is pretty and sooo is tearesa i have all threebut this is alot betty then that stupid hair cuting barbie DON'T GET THE HAIR CUTTING BARBIE A WAST OF MONEY!!!!! and the hair is wayyy to long i use her with my friends cosin i play her as repunzle
3,so far I am not impressed,"The directions to assemble were terrible, I could barely read them. The wheelbarrow itself does not see very sturdy at all. Had I known I would have bought a different one. We will see how it holds up. I should have rated this 2 starts, not 3."
1,Flimsy & floppy,"I purchased this waist pack because I liked the color and the bottle holder and I thought JanSport would be good quality. I was so disappointed after I used it that I donated it to charity.The fabric is thin and floppy which makes it very hard to zip even when using both hands. The water bottle holder is a great idea, but every time I bent over the bottle would be pushed up and try to fall out, some times it actually DID fall out.I also did not like the way the waist strap was made, the buckle ended up being in the middle of my back. I prefer to have the buckle right next to the pack so that it is easy to access. It was very awkward where it was. Plus the strap material is so thin and soft it kept folding and twisting.The color was the only thing I liked about it, it was very true to the color in the picture."
5,Mezmerizing,Beautful music performed by extraordinary artists. Extras include personal stories of the struggle that has been going on for so long.
1,Save your money,"I picked up this book thinking the premise might be interesting - a first lady is set up by a right wing pundit for murder during a hotly contested political race. However, after 30 pages I was tired of being preached to by the author of the irrevocable ""rightness"" of conservative politics. I wanted a nice read - not a sermon on how democrats, i.e. liberals in this author's mind, have ruined America. If I wanted a political discussion I could have tuned in the nightly news. Just one more person using, unfortunately, literary media to further a political agenda. This book got thrown across the room and will be going in the trash."
1,No More Please,"It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book. I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing style or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together at the last minute. I have to admit this was a sale table buy and I wish I had left it there. After falling asleep three times while reading this book I decided it was not for me. The worst part is that I could not seam to remember much about it at all, it left that little of an impression on you. The story is just not inventive. Unless you are a big fan of this author, my advice is the stay away."
1,I am a person not a syndrome.,I was so angered by the title of this book that I refused to buy it or read it. I'm a person not a syndrome
5,Excellent,This book is a must read for any adult who was raised by alcoholics. When reading this book I felt like I was reading about my childhood.
4,QUick insightful read,Being a ACoa I found this little book insightful. I would recommend to all with this history.
2,Seriously overgeneralizes,"To Kritsberg, every alcoholic family is the same. Mine was/is completely different, and I mean completely: instead of a rule of silence, there was unceasing discussion of the problem, etc. By which I don't mean no one should read the book: if the rules of silence, rigidity, isolation and denial seem to fit the patterns your family had, then this book will have something to say to you, but if not, it will be a complete waste of time, since it sees nothing outside of those boundaries."
2,Not of much use,Read it and tried its different suggestions for recovery. It didn't do anything. Nice introduction and nice theories but there are better books about recovery today. Its age is against it I guess.
5,"The ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" of Old Age","I am not in the Third Third of my life. In fact, I'm just entering my second third. However, I found this book enormously informative and comforting as I manage the care of my two parents, in the early third third of their lives, and my grandmother in the late third, or actually the fourth third.I compare this book to that wonderful guide to pregnancy that we all know, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting."" The book takes you by the hand through old age."
3,The err of bologna,"You thought this was err.You thought err, and that was err.There is no err anywhere.There nears err, but it is there.Like air. Prefer air like a sea otter confused as we are, my preciouses.Precious is was Precious does, and Precious is bare, with air in her hairand an heir in her snare.For we are confused as we are. Read and be confusedednesses.For the meaning of meaning is meaning and meaning combined withair and the hair of someone we remember, recall, call later when we've runacross err and need console gaming.Oh, game show host's false smiles smiles back to me,back to me and my poetry's poetry back in the back whereI eat a snackpack.For we are fullness of bologna and tasteless cheese.Tasteless.Bologna.Cheese.Cheese and bologna and bologna cheese taste tasteless fullness."
3,disposable music from an indisposable legend,"The two aspects of jazz I enjoy most are the complexrhythms that it tends to offer as well as the interactionbetween musicians and their instruments. Unfortunately little ofthat exists on this recording. Although it may work for some listenters, I find electronic drum beats and a general lack of musical accompanyment a tragedy of modern music. I know, it's the music that tends to sell these days, but if it wasn't for Grover's sax playing, there would be little if any soul or swing on this recording. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy a few of the tracks: Village Groove, Headman's Haunt, and Mystical Force, but I need more than three tracks to induce me to queue up a cd for full listening. I fully understand that Grover has always been into funk and soul jazz, but considering the quality music he has made in the past, I'm surprised that toward the end of his career his music devolved into something one would hear in an elevator."
2,Grover rules,"Grover Washington, Jr's Soulful Strut just makes me move!!!!!I love doing water exercises to his CD."
3,A Decent Play,"Mass Appeal is the story of a young seminary student who gets taken under the wing of Father Farley. Mark Dolson is young and head strong and devoted to his sense of right and wrong. I purchased this play in preparation of playing the role of Mark Dolson. Written I believe in the 1980s, the issue in Mark Dolson's past, which threatens to derail him on his journey to the priesthood- loses its punch when compared to more recent issues with the priesthood. The play however has much to say about remaining true to one's convictions. You'll find things to laugh at and moments to ponder as Mark tries desperately to winner over his congregation and hold onto his dream. It's a decent play and well worth the read."
1,Very bad.,"This item is very bad quality. It says ""it fits all sizes"" but in fact, it's too small and weak. When I first wore it, it torn down."
1,REALLY Bad Item,"This item was horrible. My wife bought this and it ripped the second time she used it. Poor, very poor."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"First off, the suit is NOT one size fit all...it's more of a small/medium. I had to cut the neck to keep from being strangled to death. And after 1 use, the whole inside of the pants ripped open. I am no skinny minnie, however, I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST"
1,Product is poor investment,PRODUCT DOES DO WHAT IT SAYS AS FAR AS MAKING YOU SWEAT BUT IS VERRY POORLY MADE.MY WIFE HAS BOUGHT 3 OF THESE SAUNA SUITS AND IN ALL THREE CASES THE PAINTS TORE OR SPLIT AFTER JUST A FEW WEARINGS IN FACT THE LAST ONE SHE BOUGHT DID THAT AFTER WEARING IT JUST ONE TIME
2,Very fragile!,It helps you sweat a lot but it does not last. The pants ripped right away even though I used them just for walking with no sudden movements. The top lasted a bit longer but it ripped as well.
5,Excelente,"El producto fue recibido en muy buenas condiciones, absolutamente nada de que quejarme. Soy de Venezuela y recomiendo este producto."
3,OK but...,Pants ripped on the first work out unfortunately . Sucks because I got a great sweat going from wearing this.
5,No problems here...,"Prior to purchasing this sauna suit, I read about people having problems with the pants tearing. I haven't had a problem with that at all. It could have to do with the ""one-size-fits-all"" - how's that supposed to work? We're all different sizes. I'm a size 4, but I've been other sizes. I think it could probably fit up to a size 8 comfortably."
1,One wear and then trash,"I read the other reviews about the fact that the pants split so easily, but I did not take the advice. I am a size 8. When I put on the pants, I thought these are huge and I have nothing to worry about. I walked on my treadmill and really sweat. I was thinking that I must have really burned up a ton of calories. I was wearing a pair of cotton exercise pants under the sauna pants and so I did not notice that the entire back was torn open. I did not bend or make any sudden movements. I can't understand if this is a known problem, why can't Everlast make something that actually last. I would rather spend more money and be able to use the product over and over. Unfortunately this sauna suit is already headed for a landfill. It really bothers me that it will last in the landfill for years and that it was on my body for one hour."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT/EXCELLENT SERVICE,"I have ordered this product several times. A quality product as adverstised, prompt shipment, well packaged and excellent customer service. I received emails through out the whole order process.....from confirmation of receipt of the order, notification my item was pending shipping and an email with tracking information for the delivery. Always reliable!"
2,Disappointed,I really liked it when I first put it on. But on the third day of just walking on my treadmill the pants are tearing at the ankles. and not on the seams as you might think. Guess the top will start tearing next. What a disappointment.
1,No Good..,"This item is NOT one size fits all, the suit ripped all down my legs.I could barely put the suit on, it now in the garbage, money in the trash."
1,Poorly made item,"I should have listened to the other reviewers on this item. The very first time I put this item on, it tore in the neck area. The neck elastic was so tight around my head and neck, that when I pulled it open in order to pull it over my head, it split open at the neck seam around the elastic and down the side of the neck. It's not tight anymore! Very cheaply made item. Not sure if I can sew it or not, but I guess I'll give it a try. Also, this is not a one size fits all item. It's basically a small to medium."
2,CHEAP,I ordered this product thinking that since i see alot of people walking with this thing on it must be durable. I was wrong. I wore it 2 times and the pants are totally ripped. I still use the shirt that has lasted.
2,Great for detox,"This product was great for detox, not for weight loss I felt. Any water you lose, you have to drink just as much if not more to replace or risk feeling sick."
4,Its okay !,"I like the product , it was pretty much what I expected . I didnt like that the elastic was so tight around my neck I felt like I was choking at times. The things I liked about this product is YOU dont feel like your sweating or overheated but you can feel the sweat slide down your body . Also that your skin feels smoothe and soft after every use....Some people wrote that it broke if you did squats and other similiar excercises but that never happened to me and I'm not a skinny girl."
3,Works Great,"So I bought this with out reading the description...i.e. for women. I did not try the pants on but the top was nice for the price...just small for me around the neck. Past that the product is awesome. Do put on a long sleeve undershirt and it will be drenched. I vacuumed the house in it and did lite weight lifting along with sit-ups. FYI do not try and stretch the elastic...it will rip. Summer is on the way..if you want to be an ""ornament"" on the beach by then...get it now!"
2,standard book about how to design a bathroom,"There is nothing particularly fascinating about this book due to the dryness of the writing. As a ""How To Design a Bathroom"" book, this one hits all the major points, but it does not inspire a design with the photographs picked. There were not enough bathrooms shown due to the extensive repetition of the same bathrooms throughout the book.I would definately not recommend this book to other designers due to the lack of new information or ideas. Instead, buy Bathing Spaces by Ali Hanan because of the variety and careful selection of pictures and text."
4,A valid new genre,"This recent book looks at how in the 1990s, Latina theatre emerged as a regular phenomenon in major US cities. The authors offer a study of these plays and actresses as a legitimate genre; as valid as any other in drama. What they try to do is show how this grouping differs from existing dramatic genres, and what new cultural and feminist insights these women have to offer; keying off their own ethnic and gender backgrounds.So if you are interested in new developments and insights in the theory of American theatre, this book may be worth your time."
5,Great wallet - fantastic buy!,"This is a great wallet at a wonderful price. Having spent full price for years on Prada, it is refreshing to be able to purchase such a beautiful original, wallet for such a reduced price. Lovely to have quality and value at the same time."
5,It'll Make You Smarter,"BP debunks myths, explodes fallacies, and takes sabermetrics to a new height. It has an excellent method for evaluating and projecting performance, but many other credible methods can found elsewhere. BP's riches are found in the essays and player commentaries. Its insights will reshape the baseball debate in the coming years. Roster management, pitcher abuse, big markets v. small markets, tools v. skills -- the debates defining our age and the age to come are all discussed fully and insightfully here.BP readers will in short time find themselves looking at baseball in a much more complex and accurate way. They will find themselves at greater and greater distance from the newsstand knowledge of those who rely on magazines and Baseball Weekly. They'll be better fans for having read BP. No other book provides so much. BP2K is the best value on the market."
1,"Misleading ""golf""","This product is another poor excuse to call something golf specific so it will market well. The exercises are no more golf specific than knitting would be. I am a physical therapist and strength and conditioning coach on tour and would not recommend this to any golfer. There are many other true ""golf"" products on the market."
2,"Good stretches, Bad format",The exercises are shown and then you are told to repeat 5 times and then the DVD move quickly on to the next exercise. So you have to be constantly pauseing and restarting DVD.
1,SCAM,This DVD is abpout 15 years old and it shows.You cannot follow the DVD and have to constantly rewind. Just like most golf DVD's this is a waste of money!
3,A Dated But Interesting Read,"I was looking for information on growing vegetables and fruits in greenhouses, so purchased a used version of this book (among others). An interesting read, but not a comprehensive guide by any means. All of the ""fruit"" information available is assigned to the month of April, as if that is the only month which applies to fruit crops. All of the ""pests"" information available is assigned to the month of September, as if pests are a factor only in September. And so on. So the book title is a bit misleading. This book is also 30 years old. Well written and entertaining, worth a few dollars to bring some enjoyment and some good ideas to your greenhouse gardening project(s)."
4,"Great book, but one important criticism: no backing on example tracks","John Ganapes is an exceptional tutor and I highly recommend his books. I have one major criticism of this book though, and that is that the licks don't have backing tracks or even a click track on the examples on the CD (except for a click to count in). This has not proved too difficult until I got to the tricky chapter near the end, where the rhythm is extremely complex. Unless you are able to keep perfect time while counting out 32nd rests in 12/8 swing triplets, you will also struggle as the licks get more complex. Still gets 4 stars because of the high quality of the licks and given John's other excellent books."
5,Great Refresher,"This book is a great refresher for students who may need a little reminding of the rules of phonics. Pages are not babish, so older students won't mind doing. I use this book for tutoring students who are having a little trouble in reading. Nice resource."
2,Didn't like it.,The story is dated. If you were a teen in the 70s you might dig this story. Otherwise skip it.
4,Worth the money,"One of the best concerts I have heard. Marsalis has such a tremendous tone (I like bright trumpet). Only disappointment is that CD from marketplace seller does not include the extra tracks, but did not state this."
3,Excellent performances & sound but short measure,"These are excellent performances of some popular trumpet concertos & the SACD stereo sound (not 5.1) is first class. However, at three quarters of an hour the disk is decidedly short measure - these days one expects at least an hour of music, preferably a lot more. To add to the insult, Sony Classical has is an ordinary CD available that includes the same performances of these four concertos plus two others, both played by Wynton Marsarlis. I am a great fan of SACD but I do not think this disk is worth the considerable extra cost when compared with the ordinary CD with the same performances."
3,South Shore,Putting the South Shore Platform Bed together was difficult but I have enjoyed it since I completed putting it together.
3,OK for the money,"It probably would have been easier and more efficient to just get a bed frame and mattress set. This was just a little hard to put together, but not too hard. Still the directions are aweful, and I didn't even put the molding on because the bed seems too weak to lift so that I can get the molding screwed in. But for a hundred or so bucks, it's ok. I mean, it's a bed."
1,Cheap particle board.,"Absolutely not maple, the description is misleading. Boards are all very low quality particle board. I live in basement that gets marginally damp in certain seasons, and the entire frame disintegrated. For the price I didn't expect much, but this is absurd; this quality of materials should not cost a fraction of what is asked."
2,Missing Parts,"We ordered this bed for our son and while I've never written a review I just had to on this item. The item was slightly damaged when we received it, but nothing that couldn't be worked around. The hardware and customer service, however, were another story. The package arrived with the instructions but no hardware kit. We called and requested a hardware kit be shipped to us over 8 days ago. We finally received a fedex tracking number yesterday-- only to find the hardware kit has not even shipped yet. Status? Still in the warehouse. When we called again this morning-- they apologized and assured us it would be shipping first thing Tuesday. Two weeks for a hardware kit? Apparently a trip to the hardware store is in order. Nice bed for the money, if you have the time to deal with all the issues that come with ordering from this vendor."
3,You get what you pay for,Poor assembly. Cheap wood. No guidelines on base boards to make sure they are aligned properly. Panel wood looks nice.
4,Affordable and looks great!,"I bought this bed because I was redecorating my guest bedroom and I think it looks great! It took a while to put together and it was very difficult to move so you might want to set it up in the area that you are going to keep it. Keep in mind that it IS particle board. When I first got the package in the mail, one of the boards was broken so I called customer service and they were extremely friendly and helpful, they shipped a new board to me free of charge. The directions say not to use a power-drill, but I did near the end and it went a lot quicker (you just have to be very careful).All in all, it's a sturdy, affordable bed that is a little time consuming to put together."
4,Missing alot of holes,"Definitely need a power drill to put this together, takes like an hour to put together. Wood changes shapes, but shouldnt be an issue."
2,You get what you pay for...,"You get what you pay for; furniture is made for kids, yet are extremely ""flimsy"". Afraid to move the bed; it will fall apart instantly."
1,Poorly constructed,"I would steer clear of this item. It is bulky and not easy to set up. As I was setting it up, I realized that I would never move this as it is a behemoth to set up and would be more of a bear to take apart. It is not easy to move this bed once you have it in place. I have bought cheap beds before and tI have been pleased with all of them except this one. I wish I could return it but the thought of repackaging leaves me cold.Stay clear of this item!"
1,WORST FURNITURE PURCHASE EVER.,"It gets one star for holding my bed up. But other than that this item is the worst piece of furniture I've ever purchased. I needed something not too expensive to go with my room and I didn't want metal slats. Takes a lot of work to put it together and the pieces barely match up. The side panels wont screw in and it says NOT to use a screw driver and its impossible to nail them in, therefore mine are wobbly and one is not even on. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,not in new condition on arrival,"when the bed arrived, the box looked fine, but once i opened it up, i found that there were a lot of scuff marks on the bed already in addition to some ends that somehow didn't get painted it seemed. i thought it would be too annoying to try to send back, so i kept it... it's functional but just doesn't look that great. also, not the easiest to assemble. even though it was cheap, i think you can get better for the price."
5,"great for the price, quality piece of furniture","Very well made, assembled easy, looks great! It is a HEAVY piece of furniture, have some help handy if you need to carry it upstairs, our poor fed ex guy about bust a gut carrying up the stairs to the apartment, poor guy. :)"
2,Platform bed,"Was too heavy to put together by myself, sent the item back. If putting together by yourself, much too heavy to do along."
2,Arrived Damaged - Poor Service,"I'm not sure if I'll like this bed or not. I would have found out last night but I couldn't put it together due to one of the pieces being broken. This alone wouldn't be too bad but South Shore's service is pretty terrible. I called them and they told me that the replacement will SHIP (not arrive) within 72 hours. So I'm guessing I'll be waiting at least another week or two (the bed took about 2 weeks from order to arrival) for the replacement. Hopefully, it will be in one piece.I've seen a lot of reviews for this bed that mention broken pieces. So just factor in an extra two weeks for replacements if you really want to order this."
5,Excellent platform bed,"We purchased this bed for our teenage daughter and she loves it! It is very heavy in the packaging it arrived in. We opened it up and carried the pieces up to her second floor bedroom. I put the bed together by myself in about an hour. The only complaint I have is that the wooden pieces are not all marked so it took some time to identify which pieces were which. The instructions were fairly easy to follow. I did need help when lifting the bed and attaching the platform to the base requires two people. Overall, we are very satisfied with this purchase."
1,Not a bargain at half the price,"When I purchased this bed, I was not expecting miracles. I knew that its low price would mean low quality, but this was truly off the meter in terms of crapitude. Particle board that literally disintegrated during assembly, mis-cut pieces that gave the platform a lopsidedness, and impossible to move,even inches. without something coming apart. Avoid at all costs."
2,For $200.00 Very Disapointing!,First Off! Packaged Very Badly!!#2 Instructions For Assembly Very Vague!!!#3 Product Made Of Pressed Particle Board!!And Not Very Well.#4 Hardware Included Was Missing Piece's!! I Would Never Recomend This Product To AnyOne!!!!
4,Sturdy enough,"This seems like a sturdy bed and has wide organizers below the platform. It has a very modern look and really looks great in my room. It gives it a fresh and nice feeling to it. However, the fact is says not to use power tools, but I highly recommend it if you are working alone, because your hands get extremely tired after about 15 minutes. I also recommend this for teens and young adults :)"
2,Not a good quality...!!,"It was easy to fit all parts together. My hight is 6'1"" n I feel good about size and comfirt, but the weak part is the quality of the plywood. It's not good at all. I have already broken one of the sheet in the middle. Wil not suggest to but."
2,Just Okay for the price,"This is a good buy especially for the price tag. donot expect this to last more than a year, especially if you have kids in the house. the platform is not sturdy and doesnot last long. Also it takes a cool one days time and effort to assemble it all.Recommend this for first time buy only."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this product in March, and received a damaged product. Not a problem. I called to get a replacement part. It is now the end of June and I am sleeping on a bare floor. Ive received about 6 phone calls, all from different representatives apologizing for my frustration but still I have no bed. Today I finally asked to just get my money back since I am obviously never going to see the one part I am missing and they want to know if they can change my mind.I guess after 5 months now they have decided it is time to be concerned about my order. I will never order from this buyer again. I hope if you buy from them you cross your fingers for an undamaged product or you too will be disappointed."
1,Never buy this!,"To begin with, this is super heavy... I had previously ordered sectional sofa from Amazon & didnt turn out to be so inconvenient. So thot it is a good idea to order the platform bed as well from them. Apart from being inordinately heavy, it also chips at various places while maneuvering and pokes the fingers and scratches the skin.To add to the misery, the holes in the bed don't align, the pieces dont align & it was such a pain setting it up..Had to just nail it / screw it somehow so that it is somewhat useable... I had an easier time setting up my sectional sofa, dining table or even the TV stand.. but stay away from this one if you want stay away from trouble.I ordered for a full size & twin, I didnt even dare to open the other box after unpacking one!Painful decision :(("
3,"Eminently readable, but flawed.","Beaucage's first book displays a definite talent for writing page-turning prose, but it could use a bit more discipline. Sometimes, the characters do things, not because that would be in character for them to do, but because the plot demands it. There are also logical inconsistencies in some places. Also, the historical characters tend to act and speak more like modern Americans than ancient Babylonians, Persians, or Jews. Still, an entertaining and engrossing read. I eagerly await the author's second work."
1,not what i expected from Speedo,I had a Nike google and I needed a new pair. I saw a good looking Speedo at Sports Authority and i bought it but it just doesn't do the job. Water filters and I have to remove the water every lap. I don't even have that problem with my old Nike gogles. I thought Speedo will be better but I was wrong.
4,a practical approach to the metaphor of the Commedia,"This book is part an interpretation of Dante's Commedia and part a set of related practical meditation and visualization exercises for following Dante's path as interpreted by the authors.The fact that the Commedia is a metaphor for a psychological-spritual journey towards wholeness is certainly not original to the authors. They could have written volumes on the symbolism in the Commedia from a depth psychological perspective, but in doing so, they would have lost the popular appeal of this book as a guide for a psychological-spiritual practice. They manage the balance between interpretation and practice nicely."
1,disappointed,this was such a big disappointment. the tracks broke after about 5 minutes. too expensive.
2,say it ain't so,"my dear amazon, please note....this is a dual outlet pump not single as described in your add.my tank system is set-up for single outlet pump. I will not return it and have to pay shipping and the 10 mile trip to the post office just ain't worth it."
5,Rich creamy lather,"I was surprised by how rich and creamy the lather is, even for a hard milled soap. It feels luxurious going on, then rinses off well. The scent is a very light citrus blend, I would say close to grapefruit with a hint of tangerine. Very nice, but it's barely noticeable in the shower and disappears at rinsing."
2,Turn off your brain,"Well....this book is totally improbable, full of cliches and stereotypes. If this doesn't bother you, buy it. If it does,look elsewhere!"
1,Techology has come a long way since this one,The main character to be so smart has no common sense. Lame from the beginning. Never finished.
2,Too hard to handle,"This test purports high accuracy, and that may be so. The high sensitivity test (read after 30 minutes) is certainly very sensitive.The sensor disks are ridiculously clumsy to handle, though, and setting up the test with tweezers is a time consuming and frustrating process.You'll test more often with the dropper-bottle and test tube method. That is much more important to safeguarding your fish than knowing the ammonia level to the tenth part per million.I would not buy this again and will probably not use it once my new tank has cycled. Stick with the API Master Test Kit."
2,Very poor quality,Bought this for my work to replace my sears extractor set. There is a lot of variety in sizes but bigger does not mean better. I managed to pull out only a couple of bolts before it broke. Some of the extractors strip before the bolt is removed. The extractor is made of poor quality steel and not durable. I recommend Craftsman brand or Proto tools.
4,Exceptional read for all spiritual seekers,"Jhershierra has given us a practical guide to immortality and ascension. There is some essential information in this book that is not covered in other similar literature (i.e. Saint Germain Foundation books). There's a lot of typical advice about diet and releasing addictions, and something I'd never heard of: skin-vacuuming. And for anyone interested in activating and using the Sacred Fire, this is a must-read. From one Texan to another: my hat's off to you! I look forward to the next endeavors."
5,DESTINED TO BE A CLASSIC,"This book will turn your life upside down! Jhershierra cuts through our beliefs,our attachments, our religions, our politics, our most cherished ideas, views of the world and even death itself is challenged.I could say this is the best book I have ever read but that has been said so many times before. Instead I will say I believe decades from now this book will have spawned a new movement on this planet. Fifty years from now, it will be a classic, read by millions.Is it ahead of its time? I am sure it is and perhaps we are not ready to see the truth. One thing is for sure, one day we will be, and we will have Jhershierra and those like her to thank for it."
5,Mapquest for Spiritual Growth,"Jhershierra is a very comprehensive and competent teacher of a topic many of us search for but find it hard to believe. This book, while containig some things that are hard to accept the first time you read it, offers a blueprint that not only brings together many of lifes spiritual questions but also offers the reader a simple to understand path to making it work for them.This book has made a very real difference in my life and hope it will make a similar difference in yours."
3,Hoping for More,"Does not have the range and depth of a Bob Frissell book. What stood out to me was the author's conservative, Baptist background showing through frequently. Her general additude and concept was a little too exclusive for me. A red flag always goes up in me when a spiritual teacher sees precious few equals or superiors out there. Even so I'm always looking for the kind of inspired work that leaves a mark on me, such as ""Autobiography of a Yogi""(in fairness, one of a few books she recommends)and ""The Four Agreements"". A lot to ask I know. Still the book has a lot of interesting information and good advise, although not unique, with a personal take. A worthwhile read."
5,Congratulations Jhershierra! You've written a CLASSIC!,"I have been a seeker of TRUTH for many years. ""Jhershierra's"" new book takes the serious spiritual seeker/reader far beyond mainstream religious dogma into a unified understanding that makes a great deal of sense out of the diversity and chaos of duality that has humanity in the grip of such darkness. In her book she lifts the veil of ignorance that surrounds the planet by writing with a firmness and dedicated resolve to help change our planet into a place of BEAUTY and UNIVERSAL ONENESS with the cosmos. This book is a must for any seeker's library and one that must be read until it becomes a habit to live your life in the way that ""Jhershierra"" suggests. ORDER THE BOOK TODAY! You will thank your SELF many times over!"
5,5 stars is not enough,"I give this book five stars because it just does not go any further.I'm reading this book now for the second time and it realy blows me away.To me a whole different world opens up by reading this book.On the very few bad reviews this book has here there are certainly some very liberal new agers that have turn words around to make this book look bad (ZORAN FROM MELBOURNE , YOU ARE SUCH A LIER).Thank you jhershierra for writing an absolute masterpiece that is easy to read and written in a no-nonsense style.Michel"
5,Inspiring and Objective,"I believe this book is extremely revealing, and objective.It might have to do with the fact that I tend to agree with most of what is written in it.Has anyone actually ever read the Qur'an? Please do, I did, and I could describe it as the book of hate. The words kill, slay or punish, referred to the non believers is repeated throughout the all book over 100 times. THe statement that who does not believe by totally submitting to it will burn in fire is alone quoted over 100 times.Yes, in my, perhaps simple mind's interpretation that is a dark way of living spirituality. This book on the other hand offers what I am looking for, which is a peaceful way to live and express our spirituality."
3,Good overview of the women's tour,"This book is good to learn about the tennis tour in general and how the business is changing. However when it comes to the actual players, you only get a glimpse of them. Since it is not a bio of any of the players, that may be too much to ask. Tennis fans who follow the writer's online column may not get much more insight into the game. However newcomers may find it informative. I liked the book but it didn't go into the hard issues on the tour such as coaches who have affairs with the players and what should be done. Burn out, parent/coach abuse, public pressure, big money, girls supporting their families, etc. You get a small overview of these problems. At the very least parents should read it if they want their kids to become pro atheletes."
4,Enjoyable quick read for tennis fans,A must read for anyone who wants to learn more about the players and personalities in the women's tennis world. I also learned a great deal about the women's tennis circuit. Very quick read and quite enjoyable.Do not buy this book if you are looking for something deep or substantive. This is popular-pulp people-magazine style reporting. And I loved it!
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY! THIS CD IS NOT WORTH IT!,"This CD is expensive, and for what? You get ONE new song ""Exile"" which is an instrumental that is mildly good, but is included on the CD RESONATOR. Just buy RESONATOR instead!!!Otherwise you get some standard fare Numan songs, a stupid remix of A Prayer For The Unborn, and that's about it. If you are looking for a good Numan Greatest Hits, buy the Beggars Banquet (Purple color) Greatest Hits. Or better yet, buy the Beggars Banquet Double CD Reissues along with the last 4 CDs he's done, they are all worth it! If you buy this CD after being warned you are an id-10-t!"
3,seat riser,"My mother could not use it because the seat was too hard, even with cushions. The quality in general was fine, but too heavy for her to move."
2,"Great concept, but ....","it's a brick-hard surface to sit on for any length of time. It helps in rising, which is what I was most interested in, but I quickly found out that it's really hard to sit on. I pillowed it, no help. Pulling it under me when I wanted to stand was out of the question. I weigh 235 pounds and set it for that range, but promptly found out that the amount of force needed to get the thing to lower at that weight range was more than I could comfortably generate. In the end, I sold it. Not for me."
4,Power operated lift seat,This electric-powered lift seat does a good job. That about covers the topic. I might also like to own the self(gas)-powred unit for added portability.Erle Howery
2,Never got to use it,"The seat worked fine, but my husband died before he could use it i have sent it back and was told i would get a refund thank you"
2,p100 UPEASY Power Seat,"I was disapointed in the performance of this poduct. It absolutely did not provide 100% lift. About 75-80%. Also the seat is small for one that is built for up to 300 lbs. Lets face it, if your near the 250lbs and up, your bottom is much larger than the seat resulting in, hanging over the edges. It was very uncomfortable for any extended period of time. The seat is hard and not padded well. Also, the ""recliner"" type chairs it says it will work on, is not totally true. The levers that opperate the seat are on either side, but if you sit on the lift in a recliner chair the ""sinking factor"" hinders the use of the leavers, and makes it difficult to reach them. We found it very frustrating and were extremely disapointed! This was not worth the $ in our oppinion. It would be a huge improvement to widen the seat, add more padding and have a corded seperate remote instead of the leavers on the seat itself"
3,excellent for a small fanny,"This power seat is very strong and did it's job well. However, it is built for someone slender with a small rear-end. My mom slid to the side and couldn't stay on it well. It is also not helpful for a soft surface, like a couch. The seat needs more padding as it was not comfortable to sit on for extended periods of time. Putting pillows on top was not helpful due to the slip factor when it was being raised."
3,Power Lift Seat,"Product works well as advertised but seat is very hard and uncomfortable. If you are considering purchasing, I would suggest buying a cushion also."
2,Power Seat,Product was returned as it was not functional for the person intended who uses a wheelchair and needs something with more stability that won't tilt so easily.
5,Great product for the price,"I was amazed when I received this product. It is sturdy, it expands, has and comes with a carry case. I searched for a tripod but didn't want to pay $$. Compared to one that I saw in Walmart this was a steal with all the perks. The adjustments to pan and level are great. Great item."
2,Child made logo,Logo on the ornaments i received (2 of them) is not close to a NY logo shown in the picture....sloppy and very unprofessional. Looks like a young child wrote on the ornament
3,"Lots and Lots of Trains DVD, Vol 3","DVD doesn't run as long as I had expected. Doesn't show close ups of working componets as I had expected. Still, kids love ot."
5,My boys love it!!!!,"My boys love these DVD's (ages 3 & 5)! They are a bit obsessed with trains and even after a year of owning Lots and Lots of Trains Vol 1 & 2 and Lots and Lots of Toy Trains, they still ask to watch them. We like them because there is not much talking - just music and trains... Although some adults may wonder what it is about these DVD's that holds kids' attention - it is not as flashy and not top of the line filming as most modern movies our kids are used to watching - but there is something about it that taps into the basic instinct of little boys (and girls!), as if they are sitting on the edge of railroad tracks just watching trains go by:) We have purchased Vol 3 for Christmas and I'm sure they will love it just like the others. If your kids love trains then they will LOVE this series!!!"
1,Poor video quality....,Not as advertised on TV. I bought all 3 DVD's and all 3 are the poorest quality of DVD's I have every seen. Bordering on homemade quality. Don't waste your money...
3,If you're MAD for trains.............,"Personally, I find these DVD boring...............but my grandchildren (boys 5 and 3 years old) are absolutely crazyabout them! They must ask 4 or 5 times a day if they can watch Lots and Lots of Trains again. So, if you've got train-crazy little ones, these are the DVDs for you. (the ""movie"" is nothing more than fast clips of various trains going by set to music)."
5,Soothing & refreshing,"My husband suffers from exteremely sensitive skin. He will periodically break out in itchy rashes that nothing really seems to help. However, since he's been drinking Always Active - aka George's - aloe daily, his skin has really improved. The rashes are much milder than before, and the best part is they're much less itchy. George's looks, tastes and even has the ""mouth-feel"" of water, so it's refreshing and pleasant to drink. Highly recommended for anyone with skin problems!"
1,I never received the Aloe juice. I have called and no response from anyone.,I never received the Aloe juice. I email you and call the company. I have not heard from anyone. It was to be shipped the end of January. I am disappointed from my dealings with everyone involved.
2,Poor ending to a fantastic show,After enjoying this show for years I feel like the finally was extremely poor. It was like the show producers ran out of time or rushed to finish the show early packing as much events as they possibly can in one episode.Through the years we as viewers became part of their family and we deserve more settling finally. It's like I was kicked out of their family without even saying good bye to some of the family members. What happened to Bridgette for example?Over the past few years they kept saying your spirit will look like when you die even with the cloth you have on at the time of death. That wasn't the case for Allison. She was young and wearing normal cloth. I think the finally was a joke.
2,Sadly disappointing,"One of my favorite shows. I never thought I'd say it, but this last season was terrible. Its like the writers knew it was the last season and didn't care anymore. Plus the last episode was the worst ending ever. I don't want to ruin it, but suffice it to say a main character dies. I wish I never even saw it, but now I can never unwatch it."
2,Got tired of Medium,"We watched Medium from the first show. We quit watching several months ago. Patricia Arquette is lousy at showing emotion, which she has to do all the time. Sofia Vassilieva grew into a self-centered young adult. We also got tired of the social mores exhibited in the show. Maybe that's reality, but it wasn't fun to watch anymore."
3,"Not as advertised, but probably a decent value.","This pot contained two plants, not the three specified in the listing. They were not potbound, as the listing claims they prefer, seemed to have been potted very recently (no intertwining of roots), and when I took them out to examine a lively worm disappeared into the rest of the non-soil potting mix. The two plants seem healthy enough, so I'll tend them and see what happens."
1,Infested with mealy bugs,Just had to throw the plant out. After months of spraying with insecticidal soap and even pesticides I couldn't get rid of the mealy bug infestation that the plant arrived with. The final straw was the bugs spreading to a healthy neighboring plant. Really hoping the infestation won't spread further and I recommend that any buying this particular plant will check it thoroughly before getting it near anything else.
3,Its ok !!,"I was impressed on how fast it was shipped. The plants,however, look very little like the picture shown. The variegated rope does have 3 shoots, but the longest is only about 3 inches. Also has several brown and damaged leaves. In my opinion it looks VERY DIFFERENT from the picture showing the stems about 2 times the length of the pot. The stems on the non-variegated I received may be a little longer but not much. Over all, so far the plants look fairly healthy. (I was a little concerned reading some of the previous reviews talking about mealy bugs and such.) If I was to be picking out actual plants from a store, these would NOT be my first choice, but I'll keep them they are OK."
5,Better than the plant in the picture!!!,"This plant arrived quickly and in such amazingly perfect condition - I am just thriled! A fun and unusual Valentine's Day gift that was a huge hit.The plant was exceptional quality and arrived looking like it had been hand delivered from the green house rather shipped across the country. It arrived in bloom, and the flower remains looking beautiful.I am hugely impressed!"
1,QC/QA is missing,"I have gone through 3 of these reachers in a week. They seem to last for 20 ""squeezes"" and then they fall apart. There has to be something better out there than this."
4,Pic Stik Pro Reacher,"This is a helpful product that has a firmer grip than a similar reacher I purchased earlier. Getting a bright color helps to locate it in a dimly lit room. It appears to be sturdy and it's helpful for anyone who has trouble bending, making it helpful for dressing."
1,Doesn't last,"I wanted a pick-up stick that would perform and last. It performed perfectly,but lasted only 1 month of very light use picking up paper in the neighborhood.It no longer closes and will grasp nothing.Hence one star.If I can get it replaced and the next one lasts longer I'll write another review.If it was made so that I could access grip & pick-up sections, I'd fix it myself.JMH"
1,BEWARE-Latex product,The description didn't match what was sent. Needs to state if the product contains Latex. Product contains LATEX and caused immediate problems for the end user. It would be a fantastic product if it didn't contain latex.
2,OK but...,"Got what I ordered, but found it had limited use for what I needed. Decided to keep it, but located another product that is much better."
2,Comes apart,I got this for my wife. She can't bend over. I had it for two weeks and one of the arms fell off. I found the part that holds it. Pushed it back in. It worked well for another couple weeks. Same thing happened. So I got super glue the other day and repaired it. By the way it doesn't pick up papers.
1,pik stik stinks!,"i have three reacher/grabbers and this is the worst by far! it is very hard to pull the ""trigger""--at least it's for stronger hands than mine. doesn't make sense for someone who obviously has trouble reaching or bending! not well constructed. i have another i got from the Container Store--ArcMate--that is stronger, easier to pull, just better made."
3,Not good for small stuff,"This grabbing aid is fine for larger heavier items, but if you trie to pick up something small... well good luck. I tried to pick up change and it wasn't an easy task. Sorry, I can't highly recommend this one as I really need something more versatile."
1,Sue,I purchased this item because the description on Amazon said it had a locking mechanism...I absolutely needed this feature due to weakness from a disability (yes I am one of those people)...either I am doing something wrong or mine is malfunctioning..I emailed the company and we will see what happens. for now that is why one star.
1,"In 3 days jaws stopped closing fully, NO CS response from Pikstik","My husband and I bought this to pick up roadside garbage. After three days (roughly 3 hours of use) the jaws no longer shut fully when the pistol grip was fully clenched. The paint was wearing off too, not that we cared. We emailed Pikstik RE our problem. Two months later there has been NO response from them. Buy the Unger 36"" instead if you are going to pay this much for a grabber. This one is junk."
3,Helpful except when----,"The reacher is very helpful except when the needed object is either larger or smaller than the width of the reacher. If the sizes are similar, it works very well. If items are too large or small, it is much harder to find a way to make it work. I sometimes must resort to dragging a stool over in order to reach the item I need."
1,Not good,"I am so unhappy with this grabber.Yes. I can pick up a shoe.No. I cannot pick up anything hard.I try to pick up a pill bottle and it slips out.The force required to grip anything is just stupid. The end is hard and there are little hard nubs. That's all the friction you get. Silicone would've made a LOT more sense.It does work fabric. Nothing hard, though. I would NEVER dare to use this on a glass, like the advertisement shows. I did try a little candle holder and it slipped right out.I very rarely return items, even if they don't work. But this one is going back tomorrow.I cannot believe that this item had so many positive reviews! What happened?"
1,PikStik Pro needs better parts,"We purchased a few of these in different sizes. We really like the design and it worked really well for a little while. Invariably, every one of them has broke. The handle, bar and gripper are fine, it is the plastic parts they use inside it to operate the gripper that make this a waste of time. This would be a 5 star product if they had just used metal instead of plastic."
3,"PikStik Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32 inch",Get the Ettore Grip N Grab instead. This one just does not grab small or large items nearly as well.
2,Picker upper.,I bought this product for a senior citizen who had a very hard time using it for any practical things. She wanted it to reach and grab newspaper out her front door. It doesn't work. Was not able to hold trigger down to keep tight grip on paper. Must have hand strength to use.
4,Use it all the time.,Now have two of them. Very handy to have and easy to use. Only complaint is the end pads are hard plastic and will slip if not careful. Like the rotating head function.
2,Broke after only 6 months,I bought this 6 months ago and the cable inside that controls the grabber slipped out of the cable connector. This is 6 months of average usage. It was fine and didn't notice any other problems with it except this. I can't recommend this product. I have to go look for another brand now.
4,great tool for picking up trash,great tool for picking up trash when out mowing the yard.However it fell of my lap and under the mower wheel. Once the aluminum tubing is bent is no longer useable.Will shop around for something else either cheaper in price or more durable.
4,Limited use because we damaged it,"We purchased this reacher so my wife could pick up items from the floor. She has limited mobility and flexibility and is generally confined to a motorized recliner and walker. Unfortunately, the reacher's jaws were bent and damaged when she leaned the reacher against the recliner's arm and activated the recliner's motor. The reacher was wedged against the floor and bent. She can occasionally use the damaged reacher for some limited functions."
2,Grip doesn't last,At first this was nice for picking up lightweight items but after several months it has lost its grip and there is no way to access the inside to tighten the cable.
2,Average,"Product is built well, however cannot be used to pick up heavier objects like pants. Definitely would not recommend for overhead use, it is simply not constructed well enough for that. I will say that is is very good a picking up very small or light objects on ground, I used it pick up a quarter on the ground so high marks in that regard. But as overall devices I was left unsatisfied."
2,Disappointing product,"I had hoped to use this product at the grocery store and was sorely disappointed with how useless it was. For small, light items it was fine, but for larger items (i.e. jar of spaghetti sauce, pack of meat,small bottle of salad dressing) it quickly lost gripping power for items over 1 1/2 lbs. It could not effectively grab a knob to turn on the stove, or grab a cabinet handle. For small, light things,it performed beautifully."
2,Didn't Last,"I loved this when it first arrived for picking up stuff off the beach. However, after using it just twice, the grabber part gets stuck half way so the mechanism didn't last very long."
4,"PikStick Pro Aluminum Grabber, 32""","This is a quality product at a great price. The 32"" length is great for most applications. It is better made and easier to use that most other grabbers. I have very limited walking and bending over ability so I use grabbers for most anything (newspapers, pens, paperclips, empty soda bottles, dead bugs, etc). My only complaint is it will NOT pick up one sheet of paper due to the jaw pads being too slick. I am attempting to fix this by putting some duct tape on the jaws. The locking feature (lock the jaws shut) works much better than other models! I additionally like the ability to rotate the head 90 degrees."
5,Great for Mom!,My Mom was recently in a car accident and they discovered that she had a fracture in one of her vertebrae. She was told not to bend - and had to wear a back brace. I mailed her one of these and she loves it! Using it for picking up things and esp. getting laundry out of dryer. She is also short and really needed it for reaching things. She thanked me over and over.
2,PikStik Pro Aluminum Reacher,"The PikStik Reacher has more length than my older reacher, however it doesn't grasp well, and it often takes several tries before I'm successful in grasping a newspaper, or other smaller objects. So, I usually use my older grasper. It probably works better with bigger objects such as canned food, shoes, etc. objects that doesn't have a slippery surface. But, I don't recommend it, and suggest that the prospective consumer might want to go to a health aid store and try one out before purchasing it. There are many different kinds on the market. Some are not easy to use."
2,Stiff Grip May Be Hard for Some,"For those that are looking at this to buy for someone who is elderly or has a motor disability, you may want to try another brand. I have a week grip due to muscular dystrophy and was unable to fully close the grabber. Further more the locking mechanism did not work or was not included in the model I was sent."
2,This is worse than the previous Pik-Stik model.,"I've used and depended on reachers for years because of a back injury. The previous Pik-Stiks were excellent and allowed for a fine touch, because you could operate the handle with the ends of your fingers. This new model is much cruder, and requires you to use your full hand to close the handle, losing the fine dexterity.On the upside, the older Pik-Stiks would typically break at the handle after about a year of usage, whereas this new model seems to be sturdier."
5,Handy product,"We use this on our boat to get the occasional ""dropped"" item in the engine compartment. Very handy."
1,Wish I'd gotten it at the Dollar Store,"This never really worked well at all. It just didn't pick up anything with any precision, let alone anything with any weight to it. I dropped a sock behind a chest of drawers and it took my way too long to try and get it out with this thing. Then it broke only a few days later. I wish it was an item I had picked up at the dollar store and could just throw away after one or two uses instead of paying so much for. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Use a broom handle if you must and save your money."
3,Strong but not most convenient,Purchased prior to knee replacement surgery. Works fine for reaching but ended up buying an alternate per recommendation of occupational therapist at hospital. Bought another one which is lighter but easier for picking up small items (and has a little rounded 1 inch post near the end which makes it easier to remove socks.)
2,Not strong enough,"Very disappointed in this reacher - when trying to pick up anything with a little bit of weight to it (shoes, a dog toy, etc.) the reacher just can't hold on.Much happier with this reacher:Ontel GOP2-MC18/6 Gopher 2 Pick Up and Reaching Tool."
2,Letdown,"I had high hopes, but feel let down by this product. It's sturdy and well built which is great. However, it does not allow for much grip pressure. Even picking up the kids clothes did not work well. It's OK for knocking paper towel rolls off a high self, but gripwise, poor. I bought it since the gopher versions seem to break so easily. I have resorted to glueing the gopher since it's that much better at its intented purpose."
5,PikStik P321,"I use this item every day on the job so I decided to order one for home use. I read other reviews on other stiks and read nightmare stories but I thought that won't happen to me.The unthinkable happened, they sent me the wrong product, oh no. It's a cheaper version and one that I think is not selling well so they might be trying to pawn it off to the public who they think might not notice or mind or complain and not ask for their money back or return it. Not only do I want my money back and I will return it but I will not buy it from the same company. It said I was ordering it form Deerso but instead it came from Preshers Inc., is this a bait and switch. Stay away from this mfg if you know whats good for you."
4,"Has a little ""glitch"" to it","I use this for picking up trash around the neighborhood. Although I like the design, as I pick up trash, the lock starts to engage and then I have to stop and unlock it before I pick up more trash. I think it is a little glitch in the product."
5,good product,This is a nice reacher. It is much sturdier than the standard aluminum one I received during a hospital stay. I agree that there should be a longer length available.
3,"Reid #P321 32""Pro YEL Aluminum PikStick",The gripper I bought is worse and better than the one it is replacing. The older one had a plastic shaft which broke and this one is metal. The other one had a more sensitive operation than this one. It is better than the suction cup type in that it will lift more weight but less control on what you're lifting.
1,Total Garbage!,"I had back surgery a few years ago, and I have used just about every ""grabber"" made and the PikStick is by far the worst I've used. It states that it can pickup items up to 5 lbs, fact of the matter is that the PikStick has a very hard time picking up anything over 1 lb. The grasping tips are rubber and grab things well (like paper and very light/small items), the problem is that it can't lift (no torque on the jaws) items like a shirt, canned goods, a soda, dropped utensils..... I spent 5 minutes trying to pick up a fork the other morning! The arms are too weak and are easily bent out of alignment. If you are in need of a reacher/ grabber, get one with the suction cups on the ends, or the ones physical therapy sell you with the one moving jaw/magnet on the end. Don't waste your time and money on a product that will disappoint."
2,Not Good for Disabled,"I'm disabled and spend my days in a wheelchair, so you can bet I have a few reachers/grabbers to help me in my daily life. Because this one had good reviews and it was short I thought it would be a nice addition. But when it arrived and was unpacked by my husband, he handed it to me to try out. I couldn't even squeeze the handle(s) -- still can't after several months. Even my husband who has some arthritis has difficulty using this.So if you're fairly strong I suppose this would work for you. But if, like me, you have a disability which involves weakness this product is basically worthless.The very best reacher I have is by Etac."
5,Great item for picking up small stuff,"I'm using this to clean up litter in my neighborhood. For that purpose, it works spectacularly. It's able to get a good grip on even little things like cigarette butts and pieces of paper, and can be clamped to hold something if I need to with minimal effort. It's not great at picking up large or heavy items; I wouldn't trust it for something more than a pound or two. However, without much effort, it can pick up everything I want to grab with it. A huge improvement over my older grabber that couldn't get a grip on anything."
1,Surprisingly Inaccurate.,"This book is somewhat of an embarrassment. It is the only 'official' book out there on Cliff Burtons work on MOP (as far as I know), yet it is so painfully inaccurate that I would not even suggest it to beginning bassists.Not one song, from the rhythms on the verses of 'Battery' (the bass actually plays an 8th note pattern against the 16th note guitar riff) to the omissions of the bass solo in 'Orion' and the bass intro to 'Damage, Inc.', this book has absolutely nothing to offer to bassists of any level. How one can mistake a distorted bass guitar for a Hammond B3 organ is beyond me.As a professional transcriber myself, I simply fail to see how this was ever given the green light.On a side note, its 'Ride The Lightning' and 'Kill 'Em All' counterparts are just as painfully inaccurate."
4,i play slap bass and this book gave me a better rock edge,if you are a fanatical bass player like me and you play heavy metal this is the best book you can ever buy personally i use more hip hop style but this book showed me a better way to do it and gave me a more metal sound so you should buy this book as soon as you can.....oh and buy all the jewel cd's you can JEWEL RULZ
3,3 Stars is generous,"I have always been a fan of Saga and love their studio albums. I really wanted to like this live album and was anxiously awaiting it's arrival. It started off OK but then the way the sound was mixed seemed to wear on me. It was just overly bright or something. Another thing that really annoyed me was the way the lead singer would constantly stop singing on the more popular tracks like ""On the loose"" and ""Times up"" and let the audience sing. It is OK every once in a while but I don't pay good money to hear the audience sing. I know it is the bands choice the way they perform but rein it in a little when you are recording for a live album. I am giving it 3 stars just based on the content and talent but will never listen to this again more than likely."
5,peds,very good if you have forefoot pain from over use from biking or running. It takes some of the load off the metarsal area
1,This is not for the Quad 400 Crossbow,"Thought it was. Should have read the discription closer i guess since it does say 37"". Must be another type of Barnett Quad 400. I will pass on any products don't display the product properly from here on."
3,Waterfalls,"Like all of the other reviewers, I'd have to say this book was great. It was funny, had great romance. So you're probably wondering why I only gave it 3 stars. I didn't agree with all of the beliefs that Jake Wilde had (one of the main characters). Maybe the author was trying to point out in the book that his opion was wrong. I firmly do not believe that love is a chemical reaction. Love is a feeling, a gift from God.The first few chapters were great. Then it began to drag a bit. The middle was the longest. I liked how she ended it. It was a great book."
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"I'm a Debbie Macomber fan, so I was surprised at how poorly written this book was. The characters -- particularly the male protagonist (""Rand Prescott"" -- the name itself gives you some idea of how shallow and trite the writing is) are unsympathetic and, in ""Rand's"" case, thoroughly unlikeable. The plot is unbelievable to the point of being laughable at times, and the writing so formulaic that it seems to have been written in a few weeks, at best. Worst of all, the book is almost demeaning to women, as ""Rand's"" outrageously chauvanistic and downright cruel behavior towards ""Karen"" is meekly accepted and rationalized. Debbie Macomber wrote this in 1983, nearly 30 years ago, so this was obviously an early attempt. It's great to see how much her writing has improved over the years and how successful she's become."
5,Starlight,"I love this book and the love story about a blind professor, Rand, and the woman who stole his heart, Karen ! He was a hard person to love when he was fighting his feelings, but Karen kept chipping away until he couldn't deny it any longer. They married because of her father's interface but it was shaky for awhile. But love does overcome all and it was a happily ever after in the end! If you are a big romantic you will love this book. Once you start you will not be able to put it down until you have read the entire book ! I love Debbie' s books. No one writes quite like she does, she is so unique in her ability to tell a story!"
5,Debbie Macomber Does it Again!,"If you like Debbie Macomber, this is another good story. I read bios and autobios but Debbie Macomber is the exception. Try it; you'll like it!!"
4,Carthage? Iraq? Bosnia? Anywhere.,"As well as a fine writing style and delicate character and background development, the author brings a wonderfull sense of the timelessness of the clash of nations and empires. The occasional anachronisms in the language give one pause at first but quickly slip into a plan which allows you to imagine Rome in the story standing in for a contemporary Nation or Empire to illustrate the eternal basis for war. Vengance, politics and the economy.On the other hand it is a well crafted engrossing 'historical' read."
5,Outstanding Pickups,"There are lots of choices out there for PAF vintage style humbuckers, with prices ranging all over the board. I installed these into a relatively inexpensive Ibanez AG95 with amazing results. With the right amplifier, these have to be one of the most versatile PAF style pickups out there, for the price I don't think you could find a set that comes close."
1,Poor,They sent me the kids size not once but twice. Don't waste your time move on to different item and seller.
2,Little about Gouache,"I expected ""The Acrylics and Gouache Artist's Handbook"" to have solid information about gouache; instead, there were maybe 6 pages on the subject. Most of the illustrations were quite small. This book is more about color theory and different painting styles and techniques, such as spattering and scumbling, than it is about using gouache in painting. Very disappointing!"
2,OK but not great Andean flutes,"If you like this kind of music, this album is not the best example. Tends to the pedestrian of the genre."
5,Could not Put IT down!,"If you love historical novels you will love Tsunami Twins. This book will have you on the internet conducting archaeolgical and geological research just like Henry, Pamela, Two-Bears, Ann, Liz and Ralph. I cannot wait for the sequel"
2,Too many off-limits sites,"While an excellent reference for what can be found where, this is not a good reference for what the public can actually get their hands on. Many of the (most interesting!) locations were listed as being closed to the public. In fact, 10 of the first 12 sites listed in the book are closed to collecting or have highly restricted access. This book says ""You can look but you can't touch!"". The book does get less restrictive towards the middle and end. There are definitely better books out there, including Minerals of Arizona by Neil Bearce and Gem Trails of Arizona by James Mitchell."
1,Questionable value here,"Of the 75 sites in the book, the author states 30 of them are inaccessible to collecting! The sites are either ""closed"", on reservations, or require a club membership to visit.Out of 11 other sites in the book assumed to be open to collecting that I visited, 6 were closed - mostly ""No Trespassing"" signs and locked gates.The remaining 5 sites were not very good collecting sites...There is not much in the way of practical collecting sites in this book."
2,I don't need a rockhounding book to tell me about sites I can't access,"I agree with the previous reviews that this book has too many off-limit sites. I only spent $8 on this book used but I'm truly regretting the purchase. There were 50 sites near enough to visit on my way to Phoenix, the 5 most interesting ones are prohibited (2 with full-time caretakers to keep people away), and only 4 besides those 5 that I would consider visiting, but aren't extremely appealing anyway. It is not worth purchasing the book - rent it from a library if you feel the need to read it.Too much of a history lesson than a rockhounding resource."
2,"The problem with ""look inside""","You can't tell by the ""look inside"" which book you are actually buying. I have the prior edition, and this looks like a spruced up cover and no updated content. I found the maps useful, but again, most areas have been closed or restricted, so you have to join a local club. My gripe is that look inside feature is a waste and a tease and should have a bit more content, like 1 page showing the description and the map style."
1,WORTH THE MONEY,"It does what it suppose to, only 4 stars because it couldn't fit my t1i/500 with battery grip. i had to adjust it a little.Which makes it quite woobly*Edit: after some months it broke, spend the extra money and get a real product trust me"
5,Great Stroboframe!,This stroboframe is outstanding! The quality and stability is great and feels nice and mycamera is nice and secure. I would definitely recommend this for any photographer.
2,D7000 battery extender remote mount cable doesn't fit,"I am a D7000 user that leverages the Nikon MB-D11 Battery grip. With the battery grip installed and remote mount cable on the hot-shoe, the camera cannot be placed into the vertical position as the remote mount cable head bumps against the vertical grip. It fits if you remove the battery grip."
1,unstable platform,I bought this item thinking that I would use it for portraits but it is very unstable. This is definitely not a professional product. The platform that the camera sits on actually wobbles and I tightened all the bolts available. Not able to hand hold in horizontal position at all. If I had not throw out the packaging immediately I would have upgraded to the pro model or a different brand.
2,Camera Flash Bracket,"I shoot weddings professionally and there are too many products available on the market, even in this price range, to settle for this one. It is very unstable. There's no provision for locking the camara into the vertical or horizontal position. I have a number of camera rotation flash brackets and this is about the worse. The others I own did cost more but they're well worth it. If you really intend to use this type of equipment, save up and get yourself a Newton or the like. Don't confuse this with the Stroboframe RL-PRO unit which is far better."
2,Do not buy this bracket if you have a battery grip,Bought this bracket for my Canon T2i. It does not work with the battery grip when in portrait position..cannot use the 2nd shutter release button.
3,OK but wish I had gotten the 350,"I purchased the camera flip bracket for use with my Nikon D50. It fit the camera well altough I never really got comfortable using it so I seldom did. The build is great and it still functions as new so I have not complaints with construction. I now have a Nikon D300 which is a larger camera and the bracket does not fit. I can force it but who wants to chance stripping the tripod socket on a $1,800 camera. I have since bought the model that rotates the flash instead of rotating the camera."
2,Be Careful,"This ""book"" has an OK reunion program. But it is strictly the program for reunion event. I find the price rediculous because it is only 24 pages of standard 8.5 x 11 paper, with a clear plastic cover, and a plastic spring binding. (like something you'd have made yourself at the office store)The program tends to sound like it's designed for really old people. I'm 43, and a lot of the material is not young enough for me. So, if you're planning, say, a 10th reunion... forget it. It's not for you."
2,Actual delivered mirror is SMALLER,"The mirror delivered is SMALLER than the advertized dimensions by 300 square inches. It is actually 37.5 x 25.5 inches, NOT 42 x 30. I contacted Visiondecor by email, and they have not replied in over 9 business days - they promise a 3 day reply. I won't order from Visiondecor again."
1,Would have been nice to know!,"Unless you live in Europe, don't bother...won't play in the US, and of course since it has been opened, it cannot be returned. You would think that something that ships from within the US would be able to have been viewed in the US, or a HUGE disclaimer stating such...Love Billy, would really have liked to been able to view."
2,Stroboframe is fine... cord is terrible,The Stroboframe part of this set works fine. Although it is a bit awkward to take a vertical picture with it attached. The button is at the bottom and have to push the shutter release with my thumb. The cord broke after the first time I used it. The plastic piece that connects it to the frame broke off. I fixed it with super glue but it broke again the next time I used it. I would recommend you spring for the pricey canon cord.
4,With a few modifications......,"The bracket is constructed well and works great for landscape-format photos. If you are mounting a DSLR on it, you will soon realize that the flash is in the wrong location when you turn the camera to portrait orientation. After taking out a few screws and reversing part of the bracket, it becomes useable."
3,"The flash bracket was great. The ""sync cord"" is awful.I had to use it backward so I could see the settings. I am completely diss","The flash bracket from Strobofarm was excellent. The ""dedicated: sync cord was awful. I had to mount it backward to get ti to work. I am Completely dis-satisfied with the ""sync"" cord. I won't buy any more Amazon recommendations."
2,wire broke,"Ok. Ive used this Product like 3 times maybe, and the wire broke. baaad quality, but pretty bad quality"
3,Nikon Flash Bracket and Flash Cord,"The bracket is nice and solid. It is a little heavy but is workable. I like it. The cord, however, is defective... It has bad or lose wiring making the flash fire intermittantly both on its own(!)and with shutter release, very annoying. I bought a second cord from a different source and the new one worked fine."
3,clasp flash attachement,"I like everything about the Stoboframe Quick Flip except the device that the flash unit attaches. The space allowed for the flanges of the flash unit are not high enough. the gap is too small. When you compress the clasp, my confidence begins to waiver as to whether or not this will really securely hold my Canon 580 EXII or will I be picking up the pieces during an important shoot.I WAS however able to remove the clasp and use that screw with rubber washers to securely attach my canon off shoe cord (OC-3). This now works extremely well."
4,Stroboframe Quick Flip 350 Flash Bracket,"Installed this on my Canon 40D (combined with batt. grip)Fits nice and so far so good. To date, I'm satisfied withthis product for the price I paid. I don't really use itvery often, but it's a good accessory to have when goingto group events and such when you need to use a flash andwant to have better control over unwanted shadows."
5,Stroboframe Quick Flip 350-35mm Flash Bracket with coiled Flash Cord.,"I purchased this item through Adorama. Prompt, very efficient service, good quality item and functions very well for most flash photographic situations. This bracket system is surprisingly light weight, tough, rigid and articulates very well from the horizontal to vertical positions. This bracket functions superbly when used in conjunction with the battery grips designed for the various Canon digital SLR cameras. The shutter release button is placed in a convenient location so hand stretching is not an issue.Would I recommend this item? Absolutely! It has made a world of difference to my flash photography in large group situations, and many other ones also.Raising the flash well above the camera makes a huge difference in flash photography and often eliminates the flat harsh lighting with nasty shadows around the head areas.Great product!:) Try one yourself and you will not be disappointed."
2,It is an ok frame for the money,When you receive this product you will need to place some thread lock on the screw and the top of the fram. This is the screw that hold the flash sync hotshoe. If you do not fix the screww the flash unit will swival all over the place. Hey Stroboframe-place a lock washer between the screw and the frame. I cannot be the only one that has had problems
3,"Bracket is great, hot shoe cord could use some work.","I love the bracket. It is going to be great for weddings. The hot shoe on the TTL flash cord however seems to be cheaply made. It was so tight on my camera that I had to use a hammer to remove it the first time (let me tell you, that was scary!). And now I'm afraid to put it back on my camera."
4,Good deal!,"Frame is very rugged, metal is much thicker than I expected. Has many mounting holes and adjustment options to adjust length and mounting location."
1,Off Camera Cable,This item worked intermittently. It was brand new and during a wedding shoot the flash would not always fire. Very disappointing. I did return the cable but kept the stroboframe. I bought the Canon brand cable but have not used it yet. I would not buy this brand of cable.
3,quick flip bracket is right!,"Although this bracket will work, there is a part necessary to attach NIKON cameras that isn't included or mentioned in the description. It can be jury-rigged...but don't tip or your camera will flip!"
1,Dissatisfied,"Supposed to be a ""universal"" item. My remote flash falls off every time I flip the frame for vertical photographs."
5,handy and effective,"I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for a rather cheap bracket I had purchased a couple of years ago. This bracket is not exactly inexpensive, but I had a rewards certificate from Amazon so I went ahead. The item works very well and the photos taken with the auxiliary flash unit are noticeably better, without those annoying shadows that one gets when using only the on-camera flash. I like the fact that it is easy to flip the bracket when shooting in portrait orientation. The shoe for the flash unit seemed odd at first, but it really secures the unit in place. Even at full price this is a worthwhile gadget to improve flash photos if you are using an off-camera flash unit"
3,If you like a sore palm buy this!,"I purchased this because I believed it to be of decent value for what you get. The bracket is of good quality however my only chief complaint is the bolt that attaches to the camera is actually bulky and digs into the palm of my hand when shooting vertically. After a red carpet event it feels like my hand is going to fall off. If you never shoot vertically, you are good to go, and perhaps there is a workaround to this bolt trying to plow it's way into the palm of your hand. I just haven't found one and I haven't tried.The price was decent. The quality was decent. Constructed out of good metal and not some flimsy sheet metal or something similar. I didn't have any troubles using the bracket other than what I stated above. The flash connection is secure for the 550ex I use on it. My only gripe is the bolt and I dread using this when I have to go shoot."
4,Great for hideing shadows keeping the flash over the lens.,I use this with my Canon G1X and the Canon 270ex electronic flash. Add a off camera dedicated EFU cord and this is a great package.
2,I found a solution to commonly reported problems with this product,"I found the same problem that other users of this product experienced. Particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot. I found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash. This leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated ""flipping"" of the flash that some other users have reported. The item is manufactured by Stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called ""Gadget Infinity"" under the listing title of ""Flash Bracket with 90 degrees Camera Rotate feature"". Buy it now price is $29.99. I just bought one and it arrived yesterday and I could not be happier. Pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years."
5,Flawless performance,"This set works perfectly with my 20D and 430EX. I have no sync issues, even when playing with before and after the curtain bursts. I had no idea how important getting the flash up off the camera and flipping it when turing the camera could be until I used it. The results were great. I don't use a battery grip, so I don't know how the added camera height will affect the performance. But it is a great value, even if you have to sacrafice the grip."
4,Herb info,What more can I say-it's about culinary and medical herbs. It's in my survivalist backpack. A bit bulky but worth toting around IMO.
2,Parker Posey is great...,"I enjoyed Parker Posey in Broken English, but I really liked this movie a lot better the first time I saw it... when it was called BEFORE SUNSET. This movie would not have been made if it were not for Zoe Cassavetes' film parentage. I wish my father had been a maverick indie filmmaker so I could rip off Richard Linklater movies too."
5,A Modern Classic,"Zoey Cassavetes carries on the family tradition of her famous family, John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands. This film was endearing and captivating as well as possessing just the right amount of neurotic anxiety that has commonly plagued New York characters. Parker Posey and Melvil Poupaud are captivating in this Modern Romantic Drama. When the film ended, I immediately wanted more. Perhaps Zoey would consider picking up where they left off. I highly recommend this film for 30 somethings still trying to figure it all out."
3,Issues of The Heart,"I was looking for something more related to my culture and this just wasn't the fit. However, I found the poetry very interesting and it opened my eyes to a way of life that I've been ignorant to. Bless you, Tamara."
4,COME TOGETHER,"Very good music but not all film's music represented - especially The Beatles Come Together from the Abbey Road CD. Nevertheless, a very enjoyable compilation from an excellent movie."
3,the music is good but some is missing,I really liked the music that the soundtrack has on it but they forgot to put many songs on it and I wonder what had happened to the rest of the songs missing? The movie has many more and is excellent but I only gave it 3 stars due to lack of the other great songs missing.
4,Works Good but is Expensive,"I bought the cable because my HDMI stopped working, and I suspected the cheap cable I bought (also on Amazon) was the problem. So I bought this more-expensive one. Turns out it was not the cable at all.So, this one works fine, is very sturdy, and might be ideally-suited for a cable that gets a lot of physical use. (?) But, it is also very inflexible, so you need some room to route it. It is also more expensive than some.The cheap one I bought works just as well and is more flexible. So don't waste your money on this one, unless you want a really sturdy cable for some reason."
4,Women's Bulova diamonds accent watch,It is stylish and comfortable. I really like this watch...until I can afford the Cartier I want. It goes well with gold and silver jewelry.
2,Original publication is 1997,I just downloaded this and haven't even read it yet but I wanted to state that the description REALLY needs to tell people that this research is from 1997 - over 10 years ago! The date in the description is March 2009. The date on the HBS article once downloaded (and paid for) is January-February 1997.
3,Good looking but rubber comes off easily,"Like the other reviewer said, the black rubber part gets stuck on the bottle and often comes off when you pull the stopper. Not a big deal since it can be put right back on, but slightly annoying. Not worth my time to return it but beware..."
4,Great bottle stopper,Bought 2 of these one for myself and one as a gift. They work great but you have to make sure that the stopper is dry when you put it in the bottle. If you pulled it out and then want to put it back to be sure to dry it off first then it fits tight and holds really well even with the bottle on its side!
3,not picture perfect!,"I purchased this necklace for my young granddaughter who loves everything pink! I was disappointed because the stones were so faintly colored, that it was difficult to tell they were pink. The picture showed a much deeper pink than the acutal pendant."
5,Helped quiet my exhaust drone,"I used this muffler to replace a raspy/buzzy resonator in my custom exhaust system and it got rid of the drone sound on the freeway. I was making several long drives a month and my exhaust used to be deafening after 6 hours. Now I can have a conversation in the car at freeway speeds and there's very little drone. I don't feel any powerloss either which was the whole reason I went with a custom exhaust setup. My local exhaust shop would have charged me 2-3x more than what I paid for this plus install, but they were cool and understood."
5,Divorced Christians Can Be Restored!,"This book really encourages any Christian, and particularly the divorced Christian who has sinned in his/her past, to know that the Lord can and will fully restore you. Divorced Christians do not have to feel that they are ""second class citizens"" since they are citizens of Heaven! This is a good read with excellent resources."
4,A balanced look at an unbalanced era,"Mr. Dorland has managed to give quite a balanced look at the war in Vietnam and the era that spawned it, by talking to people that played major roles on every side of the conflict. With 25 years of perspective, some memories have tempored, while others burn as hot as they did then. A fascinating read - especially for those who were not old enough to understand the state of the world at the time. I give credit to all those who were willing to stand up - even all these years later - and make their opinions known. Cogratulations to one and all."
4,Well worth reading,I brought home four books from the library and picked this one up just to read a few pages to see what priority I wanted to give it in relation to the others. I didn't put it down til much later. It's a very good book! Well worth the time to read it.
4,Insight into the real Alaska,"White Sky Black Ice gives insight into the nature and problems facing Native peoples in a clash with the modern American culture. In the context of depression and despair, truth takes on a different cast, losing its absolute power in an attempt to restore dignity to individuals. Nathan Active, the snowshoe gumshoe, must wrestle with this issue in order to reach a settlement that will serve the larger good. The unromantized view of life in the far North will awaken the lower 48's to a better appreciation of a way of life that is drastically difficult- where the biologist must go out and shot at least 10 caribou to feed her dogs during the winter! Not quite a trip to the local A & P! Easy to read, suspenseful, and pertinent to issues we all face regarding the environment and our abuse of it!"
4,Riveting.Captures various problems.Stays with story line,Was unable to stop reading. The story is riveting. It certainly is todays Alaska. It captures the various problems yet does not stray from the developing main story.
2,Not what I expected,"As much as I am a fan of the Lone Ranger - this is not the film I expected - the cover picture leads you to believe this is the Klinton Spilsbury version from the 80's - its not - its just the first 3 episodes of the Clayton Moore TV show. Which is fine if you are looking for the Clayton Moore Lone Ranger.As for the Zorro film - that is 90 minutes of my life wasted. I had hoped for one of the older black and white swashbuckling hero versions - this is at best a B-grade story that way overplays mediocre action. The sound is horrible, and the storyline is confusing even if you know the Zorro storyline.I bought my copy at a dollar store - for a dollar - that is the most this set is worth."
2,Do not judge a dvd by it's cover.,"The cover and back of the packing show the 1981 Legend of the Lone Ranger and a Zorro film. The Lone Ranger is the 1952 black and white (not even colour version ) of the first three episodes of the tv series not the movie, and the 1952 Zorro is a 1976 Zorro film with poor sound. The Lone Ranger shows were around 1hr and 8 minutes not even the 1hr 38 minutes advertised on the back. The write up when I purchased this DVD was what was on the back cover not what was in the DVD holder."
5,amazing,"amazing ep. this band began as an instrumental band, and this ep is the bridge between instrumental and the full length that followed it (which has a lot more vocals and generally a more radio friendly sound to it). they put on a good show as well, which is a bonus."
5,mind boggiling,"these guys are amazing i love them they are one of my favorite bands they emotionally just take me to another level i saw them live with silverstein,spitalfield and thee turn it ups and i think they did just as good and silverstein and silverstein is also one of the greatest bands out there right now i highly reccomend to get this and there debut album"
4,An interesting curiosity for Lewis Carroll admirers,"This was the second full-length biography of Lewis Carroll. (The first, by his nephew, appeared in the year of his death.) Reed was able to talk to many people who knew Carroll, including several close relatives, and even to the sexton who buried him, so this book is a significant source of information. Reed includes several interesting letters from Carroll (some, amazingly, not reprinted in Carroll's collected letters) and photos. On the down side, Reed's speculations are often more nonsensical than anything Carroll wrote. This book probably started the myth that Carroll had a split personality - the lecturer in mathematics from Oxford being somehow detached from the writer of children's stories. It would be unfortunate if this down side stopped people admiring the rich store of information in this book."
5,Don't spend a franc or pound without reading this guide.,"The one and only book I could find that's truly useful if you're thinking of spending a semester abroad. Easy to read, no holds barred -- honest comments from students overseas. My opinion: You're mad to go abroad without reading this book first."
1,Zero Stars,"Just absolutely terrible. Do yourself a favor, don't purchase. Not anything like I'd thought it be. I got suckered! This DVD should recieve a zero star."
4,Well done documentary,"The documentary was informative with out being sensationalized, it was to the point and paid homage to a memorable, dynamic, unsurpassed talent."
1,Wanted to like it,"I bought this CD thinking it would be great, because I love Harry Connick Jr.'s voice. The songs are very bland or very silly. This is definitely not his best work. Very disappointed!"
4,Not for me really..,"I got this CD as a gift for my husband who loves Harry Connick Jr. He thinks its great. Product arrived quickly with no complications in great condition. No complaints, other than I""m an avid Blues fan and this is def. big band/jazz! :)"
4,A worthy Xmas CD,"When jazz and smooth jazz players attack holiday/xmas music they always forget how much the classic approach to this music plays a part in getting the message and feeling across. Harry respects the traditions of this genre. All the music here is well arranged, swinging, inspiring and well-played jazz but the essence of this holiday music is still there and thank God, no jazz arrangement of ""God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen"". A Christmas holiday treasure to keep in your collection."
2,This Album does not work,"I have over 50 Christmas CD's and really wanted to like this one since Harry is a crooner ala Frank Sintra. Unfortunately this one did not deliver and I could not force myself to like it. Sorry Harry, you are a talented singer and all but this album is not one of your best efforts"
4,Christmas is Christmas,"This is a must in Christmas days.Arrangements and singings are good.It feels like two parts of Christmas feelings within one CD. Party and Gospel (?Hymn?).I love Oh! Holy Night, it sounds like a movie soundtrack.Great work, Harry. It's my first CD of HC Jr. very nice."
2,Very Disappointing,Very disappointing CD due to song choices and arrangements. Harry's heart (and voice) should have found Christmas before trying to make an album. Would reccommend this CD to the deaf for skeet shooting practice.
2,Not Harry at his best ...,"I love Harry Connick, Jr. ... I even stayed faithful to him with the release of ""She"" when many other fans were still clamoring for him to be the Frank Sinatra of the 90s. I think Harry is happiest when he's doing his own thing ... but on this Christmas album, Harry ain't soundin' happy. Many of the songs sound like he was awakened from a deep sleep (or coma) to come down to the recording studio. Some songs are downright painful to listen to. It was a big disappointment, especially considering how comfy and cozy he's lookin' on that cover! Do another Christmas album, Harry! We'd love to hear a good one from you!"
4,You can do a lot worse,"This is definitely not the best Christmas album money can buy. But if you are (like me) a sucker for the old jazz, big band-style Christmas crooning of yester-year, then this is definitely for you. Connick is always compared to Frank Sinatra, and that's probably how he prefers it. But on this CD he sings several songs as if they were his very own (and a couple of them are, in fact). My personal favorites on here are ""O Holy Night"" (what Christmas album would be complete without that one?), ""Sleigh Ride,"" and ""When My Heart Finds Christmas."" I am also curious to hear his more recent Christmas release."
4,Great Christmas cd to add to your collection,"I bought this cd for the title track that I fell in love with when I heard it on the radio. ""What are you doing New years Eve?"" is georgous too. I tend to like his sensual jazz style (ex. When Harry met Sally...soundtrack) This cd is not quite like that but it does have a true Harry Connick Jr. Flare. If you are a fan of the artist this is a must have."
1,Don't waste your money,"One word - disappointing. I love HC, but this is so terrible it would have to improve just to be bad. It is the one Christmas CD (I have dozens) that never gets played. Connick's Christmas renditions don't work. They're tired and unimaginative. You'd be far better off with a Windham Hill Christmas album."
2,Disappointing,"I must agree with Pat Brown-this is definitely not one of Harry's better efforts. He is a talented young man but this holiday collection just isn't up to par. I found it to be a bit too schmaltzy for my taste. For really cozy, relaxing Christmas music I prefer the classic stuff by Bing, Perry, Nat, Johnny, Andy, Dino & Frank-these guys really put you into the holiday spirit and then some!"
5,Christmas and Harry Connick Jr.? What a great pair!,"I am a big fan of Harry, and this CD is one of my favorites. My husband loves to play it year round, and I am so glad that HC decided to do some original christmas songs along with old favorites. What a treasure! He's even got our kids dancing around the living room!"
5,Harry's First and Best Christmas Album,"This was Harry's first Christmas album, recorded 15 years ago. And to me, it is still the best. It's pure, it's fun and not overdone. Harry incorporates some original Christmas songs, which are simply wonderful. I feel that his more recent holiday efforts do not live up to When My Heart Finds Christmas. If you're looking for classic Harry, performing Christmas in his classic big band style, you need to purchase this album."
4,Terrific '40's big band sound.,"Indeed, it's the big band sound which is the high point of this CD. From ""Sleigh Ride"" on, we're treated to the orchestral and choral arrangements so prevalent during the '40's. And this works for most of the cuts, including the strong originals presented here.However, it does fail on the two most spiritual offerings, Schubert's ""Ave Maria"" and ""O Holy Night"". The former starts with a beautiful piano accompaniment, but Harry's voice just doesn't deliver ""Ave Maria"" well, nor does it work on ""O Holy Night"".The rest of the album is great, especially for those who appreciate the old big band sound."
2,Poor Choice by me,I love Harry Connick but was extremely disappointed with this CD. I never looked to see what y ear this was recorded but it seemed to be an older Harry and I wasn't pleased.
4,Nice CD,Can't say that I've listened to this CD. It was a gift for a relative of mine. But she enjoys it so I'm happy with that.
3,A Mixed Bag,"If you are looking for a tourist guide to the different parts of Germany, this book would probably be very satisfying, although you would probably also wind up getting guides to the particular areas you were going to.On the other hand, if your interest was largely in the history of the various parts, you would likely be disappointed: the history sections are fairly brief."
5,Great tea kettle,"This teakettle arrived in perfect condition. Very shiny and only needs liquid detergent a paper towel to clean and keep in new condition. It really is almost seamless. Don't have to worry about enamel chipping or rust, as other tea kettles. Very nice addition to the kitchen. The induction steel on the bottom, heats so evenly and fast, no need for a whistle. For these reasons, I give it 5 stars."
5,Love it-Fantastic!,Ms. Bramlett- Please come out with another cd asap! This one is wonderful and I am so glad you are back!
4,Not as dated as I feared,"I recently bought this to reread after 20 years, maybe because I've just resumed playing bridge regularly! Sure it's a little dated: the details of the bridge, the prices, and especially the sexual dynamics, but it's fun."
4,What I was looking for.,"I bought this book as a gift for my grandchild who wants to start cooking. As I looked though it, I was pleased at its contents. It has the basics explained well with recipes that are simple but not so simple as to be boring. Actually my daughter has used it (mother of the child I bought it for)and was pleased with the recipe she used. I would recemmend this book to anyone interested in beginning cooking."
2,"Deceiving title, bad choice","I bought this book as a gift to teach my daughter to cook. It is the worst cookbook for beginners, it has no pictures, no step by step instructions and no explanations on cookbook terminology! It is a somewhat ok choice if you already know how to cook and don't need any supervision or explanation on what cookware , utensils to use, how to measure,etc. This book doesn't even explain what a double boiler, dutch oven, skillet or what a paring knife is? This book was a total disappointment and waste of my money, since the title is deceiving. I would never recommend this book."
4,GREAT VALUE,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. COLOR IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. IT IS MUCH MORE LIKE A BURNT SIENNA
4,Entertaining,"My 5 year old daughter and I watched this and found it very enjoyable. She wasn't sure why the donkey needed to be sold in the ""Small One"".Chip and Dale were her favorite.We like all the Disney classics and I am glad we have this one."
4,More Would Be Better...,"Just purchased this DVD yesterday mostly for the Pluto's Christmas Tree and Mickey's Christmas Carol.I don't recall ever watching The Small One,though some of it seemed vaguely familiar.It was OK,but not the best.My husband and I have always enjoyed the antics of Chip and Dale,and Mickeys Christmas Carol is one of the best.Our 26 month old granddaughter also liked Chip and Dale and watched only this episode of the DVD twice in a row.I would have liked to see a few more episodes on this DVD such as Toy Tinkers,Corn Chips and the Clock Watcher.Two of those have Chip and Dale featured on them which would have complemented this nicely.But I guess if I want those I'll have to buy Disney's Volume 8."
2,Deceivingly short DVD,"I was dissapointed with this DVD as I thought I was getting 3 christmas stories. Mickey's christmas carol is good of course, but Pluto's Christmas tree is very short, and the Small one has no ""mickey"" characters. It is a good little story, but it is just not what I was expecting."
2,A disappointment for those looking for an original version,"The overall DVD is good. But it was a disappointment to find that ""The Small One"" was edited and of course it is never marked anywhere on the DVD box that it was. For those looking for an original version of this great classic you will need to look elsewhere. Not only did the editors change the words of the song ""Clink clink clank clank"" (I assume to be more ""politically correct"")but they completely removed the entire ""Small One For Sale"" song and segment. I don't understand why people just can't leave things alone the way the movie was originally created."
5,One of my Favorite Christmas Traditions!,I have been watching Mickey's Christmas Carol since I was a little kid and was so pleased to find it on dvd. All three Disney shorts are wonderful!
5,A surprise,"Given the selection on this disc, which my kids and I all like, I was surprised to find that the one they wanted to watch over-and-over was... ""Small One.""This would be a great DVD for those out there who say silly things like, ""As a Christian I don't like Disney.""Disney was a Christian. Granted, he wasn't a preacher or a missionary, but if you look at his work closely, you can see it."
2,Okay movies but short,I was hoping this movie would be better given many of the other reviews. My 4 year old daughters watched it once and never asked to see it again which is unusual. Maybe next year.
4,Good Ol' Disney!,"This is a very cute video! It definitey brought me back to the days of my touth! Great for any Disney fan, no matter what age!"
3,Love Mickey's Christmas Carol,"Bought this DVD before I had kids, since I loved Mickey's Christmas Carol as a child. I think my parents had taped it off the TV. Was please to find it so cheap on DVD. Now that I have kids, it is even more valuable. My daughter (age 3) loves all three movies on the disc. It is a great way to get her excited for Christmas."
5,Great video for Christmas,This is a great video top to bottom. All the features are great start to finish. Mickey's Christmas Carol is (in my opinion) one of the best Christmas cartoons ever made.
4,A must have,"I was kind of bummed, because I was hoping this would have the entire ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" on it, with the whole Goofy ski instructor thing, and the Donald Duck snow fight with his nephews, but I can't seem to find those anywhere! But it is great to have the original, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to hold on to their youth!"
5,Just what I was looking for,I have been looking for Mickey's Christmas Carol for years on DVD and was excited to find it! Great purchase and good value.
4,"Sticking to it, The art of Adherence",Common sense put into print. Great information for supervisors of all levels as well as the individual. Provides good ideas and techniques for improving leadership and personnal skills. A must read booklet.
3,An Insight Into the Russian culture,"Although I wasn't a huge fan of the book, it did give a good insight into the Russian world. Mendel's courage and dedication should be looked up to. This book tells the story of Mendel, a Russian boy, trying to get away from being forced into the army. It shows many ups and downs but tends to get boring. It does have some good moments but for the most part this is not the best book I've ever read."
2,"Fun, shallow, campy nonsense with lots of cute girls...","Yes, yes, two of the sororities on campus are actually covens of witches. That's normal behavior. Anyway, that is more or less the plot of this fun, campy, flick. If watching a lot of drop-dead gorgeous young college co-eds run around pursuant to a silly plot about witchcraft, sacrifices, etc. appeals to you (it did me) then this film too is for you. The acting is endurable, the dialog is fun, and the plot is one-dimensional but so what? Every now and then some of us want to take our critical and cognitive facilities off-line and just have fun. This film is perfect for that. RJB."
4,Interesting,"The movie was interesting, but the thing that I didn't like about it was that Summer Glau, one of my favorite actresses, was hard to root for most of the movie because she was far too self involved. Over all though, the movie was worth watching."
3,No comparison to the original but still okay,"It didn't take me long to realize that this movie is never going to live up to the original - as is always the case with these remakes. From the opening scene, where mommy walks the girls right to their dorm room, I knew it was going to be a dumbed-down version, and that's fine. From there, I continued to watch, trying really hard not to look for the old storyline in the new one. It is in there, hidden behind the sarcasm and dumb jokes.If you're old enough to have watched the original years ago, you'll probably hate this remake. If this is your first time seeing The Initiation of Sarah (and you're under 40 years old), I think you'll enjoy it."
3,The Initiation of Sarah,Not to sure if I already wrote a quote on this but I really didn't care for it. It's for teenage girls and my teenager did say it was not all that great. I was glad I didn't spend alot of money on it. I guess it was an old movie and what girls do to each other when they are jealous. Great condition and fast service.
3,average,"Another entry into the chick lit genre.While I did not hate this book, I felt it was extremely average. The storyline sounded promising and the first few pages were very good. However, once your main character decides to ""try"" to have sex (sort of )with the new guy in her life (sort of), the book and the storyline started feeling just like many standard chick lit books.Also, I am extremely skeptical of all the ""coincidences"" that just seem to happen to our main character.While this is not a horrible read, its really average. Save yourself the money and get it at the local library."
1,Disappointing,"This is my second Cuisipro whisk and it has suffered the same fate as the original - the silicone has cracked. I never liked the feel of this whisk either (too mushy), so I didn't use it very often. I suggest trying one of the other brands."
1,Everlast Slimmer Belt doesn't last,"After using the belt for two weeks it starting tearing. I purchased two of them at the same time and they both did the same thing. I would not recommend buying this product, it won't last!"
2,"Here's the first chapter, where's the rest?","While this book had some nice passages, it was just too short. It felt more like a first chapter, or an outline for the real book to come. It seemed overpriced, and overbilled for the actual thing.I'm happy to hear that the book has brought comfort to some--but I was disapointed by it. I recommend another book ""Silent Sorrow"" to mothers who carry sorrow instead of the babies they expected to hold. Peace to all who grieve."
3,Not Very Good,"I Love Gloria Estefan...but this album is not her style. Songs sound forced, sometimes out of control. One or two songs are ok."
2,unexpectedly depressing,"This is an incredibly depressing album. Although the songs were the traditional Christmas ones, Gloria's rendition of them, instead of being upbeat and happy were sung as if she had no hope left. This was disappointing coming from such a good singer."
2,Disappointed,"Although I have always been an ardent fan of Gloria Estefan, I was disappointed in the make-up of this cd. This was not a cd that was well put together."
5,Great music,I found Channing on myspace and this music is so cool. I can just listen to it over and over and over. It's so fun and fancy free. Great summer love music all the way.
1,Welcome to Ralph's World-BORING,This was the most boring and uninteresting CD/dvd that I have ever ordered without knowing what I was getting. My kids were totally unterested and we haven't even heard the whole thing. We can't stand it that long.
5,"fun for all ages, including grandparents","this cd comes with a dvd of music videos. i bought this after seeing the video on disney channel. my 18 month old twins were mezmerized, which doesn't happen that often. grandma and grandpa even like the music. it is one dvd that will keep my girls attention and not drive me crazy."
5,Ralphs World dvd,"My Granddaughter borrowed this from the library and really liked it so I asked her to tell Santa to get it and he did Thanks for being so quick to send it, it is now wrapped and ready for the big day along wth other surprises Thanks again"
4,Wonderful Children's Music,"The thing I love about Ralph's World... Is his music is not annoying for adults to listen to... I catch myself singing the catchy tunes along with my daughter. She LOVES Ralph's World! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is I felt the included DVD was too short, I wished it had a few more music videos on it (to make it longer)... my daughter likes to watch it over and over again so I have to keep going out andre-starting it while I'm trying to cook/bake or clean the house so she stays entertained. He is a wonderful Children's entertainer and I actually like him better than Raffi... I feel he is like a more modern hip hop/rock version of Raffi for todays youth!"
5,Ralph's World,"This is a great Music CD with a bonus DVD. My twin boys, age 4, love the tunes and enjoy watching too."
4,I LOVE IT,The Almond is an inspiring and erotic novel that shows the power of sex. the author develops a passionate relationship with a wealthy doctor.That says something about the human spirit - and everything about this remarkable woman.I would recommend this to any of my female readers and Sex and the perfect lover by Mabel Iam.
1,Pornography,I purchased this little gem after reading a favorable review in the International Herald Tribune. I read about half of the book before tossing this porn into the garbage where it belongs.
1,Whipping flesh to make it Real,"The Almond has been heavily hyped by reviewers as an erotic and inspirational story of an Islamic woman. It falls far short of the its hype and promise. Badra's story perhaps is interesting as it ilustrates the tribal customs and feudal culture that allows the bartered exchange of women. But there is nothing Islamic about Badra as a woman or her sexual pursuits. In her zealous pursuit of all things haaram, she views herself asa self actualized and empowered woman. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. At the ripe old age of 50 (GASP), she has no family, no friends and no meaning. Her aggranidizementof her sexual escapades left me feeling cold and clinical. She counts the notches in her bed post--- and a successful encounter is, for her, one in which she dominates and rejects her suitor. This isn't success; this is pathology. The book fails also as a vehicle of literary erotic expression, because her writing skills are pedestrian."
2,I've read this story before,"For once I would really love to read a book that purports to be about a woman's sexual awakening without having said awakening occur at the hands of one man with whom she falls in love but who treats her poorly and/or can't seem to express his love until she's left unable to really love anyone else. Not that that's the exact plot here, but how many ""women's erotica"" books can be summed up that way? I have no problem whatsoever with the SM content (see my wishlist if you don't believe me) and wouldn't have had a problem with the story itself if I hadn't read it seventeen times before."
3,"Only slightly ""erotic""","An erotic awakening of a Muslim woman. Badra (moon) is living in Tangiers with her Aunt after escaping from an abusive and loveless (and childless - he's infertile but blames it on each wife as she comes and goes) marriage.Driss, a rich and independent thinking cardiologist awakens her body to sex and her mind to love. What's interesting is this is a slim novel (150 pgs?) and only a few passages of erotic sex. Yet the cover states ""most erotic novel I've read..."" and tons of press."
3,Sex is the same all over the world,"West or East, Christian or Muslim, repressed or not, sex is something we all have in common. It would be best if we all were just more open about sex. This book is a breakthrough, because it is a Muslim woman opening up about her sex life. It's sexy and interesting. I like books like this and Abby Lee's Diary of a Sex Fiend: Girl with a One Track Mind. Anytime I can read about what really goes on in a woman's head (sex-wise) it's fun and exciting."
5,FANTASTIC READING,Read this book with an open mind. The Almond takes you into a world seldom revealed. I enjoyed this book tremendously and could not put it down.
2,Too subjective to be a history book,"I have the book ""Sultans"" and I find it very subjective. The part about Ataturk is direct replica of Armstrong's ""Grey Wolf."" At other parts, the writer tried to show that he is quoting from other people as if every person who wrote a book is worthy of quoting. All the quotations are from the missionaries living in Turkey. Given that Turkey was considered to be ""the others"" in the Christian world, you can not expects the missionaries to be fair in their explanations...But if you read the book with this in mind, actually the personal explanations of the sultans are fun to read. I learned some personal details about Abdul Hamid which I did not know for example.But I would not suggest this book as a means to get historical information."
2,I'm very dissappointed.,"I am a long time fan of the Grouch's material. This album does not feature any production by the Grouch, and it is far inferior to his unique production style. The one song I heard from this duo from grouch's my baddest btchs cd, was very dope, far better than anything on this album. There is far too much singing and pop appeal to this album for my taste. Although this album is far better than any mainstream hip hop, buy any other grouch album, the first CMA album, or either G&E album before this release. It has one really good track, the 2nd track. The rest is truely forgettable. I'm not familiar with Zion I's material, but this is really unimpressive stuff from him. Grouch is the only reason i give this album even 2 stars. Production lacks, singing ruins otherwise good songs, and Zion I is really just boring to hear."
5,this book is great !,I have just read this book I loved it so if you are at the book store or library GET IT!!!
1,Boring,This Book is no good!. Marco was only hit by a baseball bat and when he comes back he notices a phone call from Keith saying that he lives in his basement.
1,NO PLOT!!!!!!!,Usually I like Goosebump books but this book is awful. It gets so confusing. I can't really even tell you what the plot is about. So if your at a bookstore don't buy this book. Trust me you'll regret it once you do
4,protect your house protect yourself,wiping your shoes on a mat before entering a house is not enough. our Western civilization habit of coming inside a house tracking whatever organic pathogen(s)or inorganic toxic substance(s) is really barbaric and unhealthy. the Eastern practice of removing shoes at the entrance is the preferred choice. i use indoor slippers or go barefoot. these shoe covers are great for guests and workman who don't feel comfortable removing their shoes and doesn't insult them.the only thing that i would like to see is for them to have a waterproof lining.
4,Nice short book on Interviews,This was a nice short overview on job interviews.If the book was any smaller you would have to charge one dollar.
2,MUCH ASSEMBLY REQUIRED,"I have not even fully assembled this product and already I regret the purchase. I am assembling it for our church nursery, but I cannot imagine being sleep deprived from having a baby and having limited free time, trying to assemble this. I purchased another brand also, more expensive, with not nearly this much work. It would be worth it to me to pay more and do less. Im sure it will be fun for the babies once I get it put together but..."
5,Great Toy,"At first I thought ""Man, there's a lot of parts to this thing,"" but it is very easy to put together and went together quickly. I put it together right before I made supper. It has the perfect things babies love. Things to flip open and shut, soft squishy things, things to spin, a mirror. Everything somes off easy when you need to clean it. This is new for my third child. Our other saucer was given away. This one is so much better. It doesn't have too much on it, just enough. Our babies have all loved using an exer-saucer. As soon as they can hold themselves up sitting (around 4 or 5 months) we put them in an exersaucer. It really does free me up and keep them happily occupied. Plus, the price of this one is great. Some cost so much more and you don't have to pay more. This is great."
3,"Good, but could be better","I bought this particular exersaucer for my 7 month old daughter since it could be folded and we could travel with it to Grandma's. My daughter enjoys it and its helpful to me because I can plop her in it, and actually get some housework done while she plays. The downfalls to this toy are that it is a pain in the butt to put together, took me about 1-2 hours...it was especially hard to get the leg springs in place. Sometimes when you fold it, the springs will pop out and again you are struggling to get them back in place. Also you cannot replace the batteries in the little spinning circus tent that plays music. The music only lasts about a month before the batteries die (I had to reorder another one through evenflo, and now after another month I will need to order yet another one again - cost $10) The snack tray is kind of useless, it would have been better placing another toy in that spot. I give it a 3/5."
4,My baby loves it... I wish it collapsed down further though.,"So I put my son in this when he was 3 months old and he absolutely loved it. Every time we put in him there he grins and plays with the toys and contraptions hanging off of it.The construction of the bottom feet could be a little better made, but they are definitely strong and they appear to be safe.3 Months is a little young to be putting a kid in this, so please keep in mind that each child *IS* different. My son has been standing with help for quite a few weeks now, he has been lifting his head up and holding it up for extended periods of time by himself. (He still requires support to sit up, but he's been holding his head up for quite a while)I wouldn't put a kid in this if they couldn't push up and stand with his legs (with support/balance) or especially if they couldn't support their head."
3,Good activity center for the money,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 4 months old, but she was too small for it and not coordinated enough to get any enjoyment out of it. She is now 6 months old and is really starting to like this. She likes the music and she can spin the seat around to get to the toys she wants to grab. She can spend at least 20-30 minutes in here now and it's fun to watch her play in it. I didn't want to spend $80 or $90 on an activity center and a friend had this and said her son liked it, so I bought it and I'm happy with the purchase. I can see my daughter liking this for several months to come, and it's unisex, so we'll save it for our next baby. One thing I wish is that there were other toys you could buy to snap in and have some more variety. That's why I only gave it 3 stars."
5,excellant purchase,"This is a good purchase for those of you that need a break from holding your child. I.E. cook, clean, and rest, not ignore. Our son loves to play with the toys and seat is deep enough to keep him upright at 3.5 months old. The only draw back is the instruction sheet. The pictures are not colored and include no words to help you along. The best thing to do is look at the front of the box."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING???,"A child's toy that the batteries are not meant to be replaced? Especially at this price? Come on, get a clue. Now don't get me wrong- you can replace them with a lot of work.1) Open the case with a small phillips screwdriver (think eyeglasses size2) Carefully pull out circuit board where the batteries are attached3) Pry down the tabs that are holding the batteries in the metal strapping that is soldered to the circuit board4) Read the batteries for size (no indication in their documents of course)5) Drive to the store to get batteries (these are watch batteries- something you won't commonly have around the house)6) Slide battery in7) Bend tabs back up8) Carefully slide circuit board back in9) Screw the darn thing back together10) It's play time- WHEW!**Also, ours does NOT have the 10 or 15 songs (depends where you read about the product) It only plays one (1) circus theme."
3,"ok saucer, not great","I initially bought this exersaucer for my twin 6 month old boys. Although it has a lot of nice features (portable, easy to adjust, interesting toys and cute music), I didn't feel it was terribly safe - the toys had lots of pointy things that my boys kept scratching their faces on when they would try to play with them. (I also didn't see the point of the snack tray thing that was part of the exersaucer since kids who would be using this kind of toy aren't snacking. It worked ok as a holder for other toys, but seemed like a waste of space to me.) I returned it and got the baby einstein exersaucer which I find much safer and which my boys actually seem to prefer."
5,Great distraction for a toddler once we got the pieces,"This is a tremendous ""bouncy seat"" for a toddler. My son is 8 months old and has been enjoying this for a few months now and seems to never grow tired of it.The only problem we did have is that we were shipped an open package from Amazon (presumably a return) and there were at least 10 pieces missing from the box. Luckily Evenflo stood behind their product and had all of the missing parts delivered to me with a few days."
4,exersaucer Mega Circus review,"I purchased this for babysitting for my nephew-It was not that hard to assemble, but as it folds-it should have come assembled. The folding feature is great. The toys are very nice-and are easy to remove if the baby wants to play with them. The folding legs are hard to unfold-they keep locking up. the little feet on the bottom fold up too easily. All in all though it is a nice product."
3,love it - but not for tall babies,This is an awesome toy and my son loves it but I was very dissapointed when I read the instructions and it said to stop using for a baby over 30 inches tall. You're supposed to be able to use it until your baby can walk but my son is only 5 months old and he is 29 inches tall so if you have a big baby - I probably wouldn't buy this.
4,pretty good,"this type of product is fantastic. good exercise with lots to do no matter which way the child turns. my daughter, though, with one model of this brand (with the yellow top, rather than the red), kept hitting her head on one of the toys. we took that one out. another one, she was able to pull out several times herself and shove the long end into her mouth. not good. another toy comes out on occasion, but it's not nearly as loose now that i've fiddled with the tabs on it. all in all, great idea, but be ever watchfull for the first few times in it."
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought this toy when our daughter was 4 months old. She grew with it...loved the music, which is why we bought this particular model. However, we soon found that once the battery ran out on the music toy, it couldn't be replaced. That part of the exersaucer became useless. We've since had another baby. He never got to use the music part of the toy. We took it down after one month of use because of boredom. The plastic toys are cheap and boring. Since the only part that was good about this toy was the music, it's a waste of time and money because you can't replace the battery."
2,Buyer Beware,"Initially I was okay with this toy. However, the plastic is hard on a lot of the pieces and I thought my baby might injure himself, he didn't. The part that I am most unhappy about is the book like tabs with stickers. The stickers have worn away with teething, most likely swallowing it. I will not use this product again."
2,Ouch!! Pinched fingers!,"This product is not that great as far as exersaucers go- we replaced a few of the toys for more exciting ones. At least evenflo makes replacements. The main complaint I have is that the flip book that comes with this seems to always get little fingers caught in it. My 6 month old daughter loves to turn the pages (and chew on them) but she would always get the side of her fingers caught. This lead to numerous tears and we finally took that toy off. The other thing is that she sometimes just sits in the exersaucer, not playing. I don't think it stimulates her enough. If I had to do it again, I would buy a better model. This one just isn't that great."
1,Not very entertaining,"My 5 month son is very active and when we put him in this exersaucer...he gets bored in a matter of minutes. There is not much for him to play with. I looked at other entertainers at the store and there are definitely some better ones out there. Overall, this is not worth buying. Check others out first!"
3,"If it's not broke, don't fix it!","I had received the Evenflo Megasaucer in 2003 for my daughter. It was great! It had the steering wheel, which she loved, and it also would bounce like crazy!So, a few months ago I purchased another Evenflo Megasaucer for my son. It was easy enough to put together, but the toys were different. The circus style, with no steering wheel like the first one and it has a snack tray??? The ages that are appropriate for the megasaucer should NOT be allowed to have a snack while they are moving around, bouncing, etc. I think it would have been better if they used that space for another toy or two. Plus, it doesn't bouce too well, not like the one my daughter had a couple of years before. He gets board very quickly in this. Not many entertaining toys.If I would have known I was going to have another child, I would have kept my first Megasaucer, it was much better."
5,Fun ! Fun ! Fun !,"We are in Canada (Sherbrooke, Quebec most specifically), our little daughter Marie-Soleil like this toy. She is 3 1/2 month and she love staying in there for almost 30 minutes. She can already play with the toys which is great !"
3,There are better products out there....,"We put this together last week for my 6 month old daughter. She wasn't too impressed with it. We wanted something for her to bounce in the strengthen her legs. It's supposed to bounce, but it is so hard for her to bounce in it since it's all plastic and you have to go in a downward motion to get it to bounce. When you do that, it barely moves. You have to push pretty hard on it to get it to move downward. It's a good activity center and she did like the toys but as a bouncer, it's not very good. The Jumperoo is suspended, so she is able to kick off with her legs and get it going. She really likes that one. So bottom line, if you want a jumper, pass on this product."
2,a dissapointment,I bought this exersaucer mainly because I wanted my boy to jump in it. but we realized that it's quite hard for him. It even takes a bit of an effort when I tried to press it down with my hands. It's not as exciting as I thought it'd be. Very dissapointed.
4,arp_77,I got the Exersaucer for my 9 month old daughter.She loved it and enjoyed being on it for upto 30 mins.This was definitely a good buy and worth the money that I have spend on it.I would recommend this product.
2,"""Base Model"" with Disappointing, Too Few Toys","I received this Exersaucer as a gift and was incredibly disappointed at the quality of the toys on it. My niece and nephew have the castle/fairy tale themed Ultrasaucer and it is loaded with cute and interactive toys. My baby even loves the clear spring covers as they are so colorful! Unfortunately, the Mega Circus model not only too few toys, but the toys are also so much more basic! (I don't expect that my child will use this for too long.) For the cost, I would have expected some more interesting and interactive, not just a few ""colorful plastic animals on pegs"". There are much better activity centres out there, not much thought looks to have gone into this one and it isn't worth the money. Lastly, not sure if it was just me but I found it very diffucult to fold."
5,"wish it came assembled, but overall a great product","Alright...we bought this exersaucer for my little boy. Bad part: We had to put the whole thing together, including the springs. Good part: It wasn't extremely hard, but time consuming. The box that it came in was big enough for it to come assembled... not sure why they didn't just do it at the factory.Anyway, overall, he really likes it. He was interacting with it as soon as he got in it. Recommend..just make sure to have a phillips head screwdriver."
2,Batteries not replacable,"I started using the exersaucer when my son was four months because he could control his head. I loved the toy because I felt safe using it at such a young age. My son's favorate part of the toy was the circus tent that spins and lights up. Unfortuanately, the batteries in the circus tent are NOT replacable. The circus tent stopped lighting up and playing music about a month and half after we purchased the item. Now my son has lost interest in the exersaucer since it no longer lights up or plays music."
4,Great Entertainment,My son loves his ExerSaucer. We started putting him in it at 4 months and he just stared at the toys while we played with them. Now only one month later he loves spinning the wheel and pulling all of the animals towards him. Of course they all go straight into his mouth. He has also figured out how to practice standing in it. We have already gotten our moneys worth with this toy.
3,Too many loose ends,"Valuing mining shares, which should be the meat of this book, is limited to Chapter 4, ""Valuing Mining Shares,"" pp. 231-250. The treatment covers standard metrics for the most part, with few sector-specific insights. I would recommend that in the next edition the author devote far more space to working through comparative valuations and demonstrating the validity of the methods. Otherwise, the book is well written and an enjoyable survey of the mining sector."
1,Difficult to Say...,"The fact that Elizabeth Croll is a Westerner who studies Chinese culture - in the discipline of anthropology no less - makes me skeptical as to how much she really understands of a Chinese woman's experience. There is much to be said for experiencing being a Chinese woman first hand. I am Chinese by ancestry and quite unsettled by this. Her scholarship falls under the general category of cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology itself is a questionable field because it comes from a tradition of examining 'the other', like how you might examine animal or insect behavior. Those methods of anthropology don't sit well with me. I would rather that someone take a gander at 'European Anthropology' and try to understand what those colonizers where thinking when they ravaged much of the non-European world. If the history of anthropology was inherently racist, what should anthropology be now?"
3,Way too religious oriented!!,"I bought this book thinking it was more along the lines of New Age concepts. I was wrong! To me it makes way too many references to bible verses and and praying. I do believe in praying, but this book just makes it seem all to orthodox oriented. It's ok but definitely not what I expected."
3,Very Condensed,This book is way too condensed for my taste. It's too short without enough explanation.
5,Love it,I laughed a lot. The unusual pets were great. I like the tension was offset by the laughs. You knew something had was coming but wasn't overwhelmed.
2,Not like her others!,"I got this book b/c I'm a Deborah Smith fan, she's one of my favorite authors but this is one of her earlier books and it shows. This story is about a former beauty queen with an IQ of over 140 who has turned in her crown for some unknown reason and years later she becomes mayor of a small town, she meets a journalist and since she has a secret to hide, she doesn't trust him or herself. I found the storyline simplistic and the beauty queen, a fool, even if she had a high IQ. Just because someone has a high IQ doesn't mean they have any common sense. That was the problem with this heroine."
5,Where were these when I was a kid?,"This is one of a series of 3-D children's books that is just great. Not only are the stories cute, but the thick cut-out pages of the book create a great looking display in a child's room. A great gift item for small children and their parents."
4,Durable slicer,This is a great slicer for the price. One if it's best features is how easy it is to adjust the thickness of the slices.
4,Big but I like it,"I just purchased this set and after all of the reviews, I had to write my own. I have not tried it on tomatoes (mainly because I don't eat them!) but I used this thing last night and it was AMAZING! If you use the food holder, you will have no problem with the swing arm as the plastic guide around the holder pushes it out of the way. I am so used to slicing with a knife, that this cut the job in half! The unit is large and I had to clear some space to store it, but other than that, it works fine for me. I will report back if I have any problems with it."
3,So-So Slicer,"This slicer works okay but has some serious drawbacks. One, the julienne blades (both thick thin) didn't slice all the way through the food. Second, the swing away blade guard just gets in the way when you're trying to slice AND just swings out of the way when your fingers go by - Ouch! The blade storage container is nice, and plain slicing is okay and adjustable. The stand is pretty big but also sturdy. The food holder is too complex and hard to align. While it is dishwasher safe, it takes forever to dry. The small plastic compartments hold a fair amount of water. Due to its inability to julienne, it's not a good value."
2,Don't Give Up Your Knives,"I bought this to slice fruits and veg. for my dehydrator. It doesn't work worth a hoot on anything that is ripe or soft like bananas, peaches, nectarines etc. It is big, clunky and takes up a ton of room in the kitchen. The safety features are just in the way. If you have any knife skills at all you can slice much faster and easier than using this very expensive slicer. Not too easy to clean either."
2,NOT great for french fries,"Just tried this for the first time to try and make french fries With the large julienne blade and set at 5/16"". for the sweet potato, I ended up cutting it up by hand. I used a gold potato and had to use a lot of effort to get through it. Any hints on how to make this easier?I think the safety features are probably great."
4,Wireless Thermometer/Atomic Clock,I got this for my husband for christmas and it was the easiest thing to set up. He's very pleased with it and checks out the weather every morning before leaving the house. It's been right on every day.
1,"bought a year ago, and it already fell apart, shampoo is too $$$ also","I was so excited to finally get the spotbot. I have a cocker spaniel, and there are always accidents that happen. I have not had to use it that much over the past two years, which is why I was so surprised when pieces began to fall apart so quickly. When the scrub brush broke while I was using it that was it. There is only so much glue and tape you can use to try and salvage the investment that is put into a product.Moreover, the replacement carpet shampoo is shockingly expensive. I should have done more research before buying the product.I am thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the product."
5,Just what I hoped for...,"I recently purchased the Bissell SpotBot Pet because of my hardheaded little Boston (gotta love her)who is only potty-trained when it's convenient for her. I read the other reviews to see what others had to say and overall it sounded like a pretty good deal. I am impressed with the results. I definantly do not regret the purchase. I love how easy it is to use. I agree with others that it does leave behind a little more water than I'd like, but that's not a problem. All you have to do is use the hose attachment and suck up the rest. Overall, I give in an A+."
2,Good but not great,"I have owned this machine for about 18 months and have used it A LOT (2 young puppies and carpet...bad mixture). There were some things that disappointed me with this unit: 1) it never dried up all the water, always leaving a wet spot, 2) on my carpet, if you never vacuumed over the spot, it left a lasting circular imprint on the floor (for at least a week) and 3) I had to repair this unit once because of a gear was making an odd noise, and then 6 months later the unit was totally hosed. I have to say that there aren't many alternatives to having this unit, and for cleaning messes that you don't want to touch, it does a decent job. Just be careful of prolonged use and circular imprints!"
1,Brand new product not working,"Received this item yesterday. Took it out of the box this morning, went through all the instructions, step-by-step, set it up for the manual operation, turned it on and it did nothing. The power light came on and the little green light next to the manual button flashed, but no power. I called Bissell and the representative walked me through all the steps again and nothing. She said it was likely an internal problem and suggested that I take it to their nearest service rep, which is a half hour away, to be looked at. I went ahead and took it in, but in hindsight I should have just returned it to Amazon. Guess we'll see. Definitely not a good first impression with Bissell."
5,The best ever!,"This is the best invention/product ever!! Easy to set up! I can put it on the stain, walk away and do something else, and come back and the stain is gone. Well worth the money!!!!It's already paid for itself and I've only used it a couple days so far! I've been using it on my stairs (it even sits perfectly by itself on my stairs) where my cat puked on every step on beige carpet. I love it! So far so excellent!!!!!"
5,It really works,"I have 2 dogs, 2 very messy dogs. I have bought so many carpet cleaners over the years and none did the job as promised.This little machine does, it has taken out every nasty stain on my carpeting.Finally, a winner."
3,SPOT BOT,"I AM OVERALL SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT, HOWEVER, I DO AGREE THAT IT DOESNT VACUMN UP ALL THE WATER WHEN FINISHED SO IT IS ADVISABLE TO USE THE H0SE VACUMN TO GET ADDTIONAL WATER THAT IS LEFT IN CARPET."
5,GREAT MACHINE!,"I have four dogs in the house. One of them is a puppy and the oldest is fourteen. Needless to say we have had to use this machine many times. It does a great job for such a small machine. I recommend using the handheld attachment after cleaning the spot to suck up more of the liquid in the carpet(the spot will dry quicker). I also don't put the cleaner in the machine, only water, because I use ""Nature's Miracle""(enzyme cleaner for pet stains), on the carpet first.This is a great way to clean up spots in between a regular full carpet cleaning. It is lightweight, and very user friendly."
5,Outstanding Little Machine!,"This machine does an unbelievably great job! I used it on 6' x 6' area of rug that my 4 year old pug decided all of a sudden to use as a his own little bathroom area. I used the manual/hose cleaning feature only because I had such a large area. I was so pleased with the job it did. Not only was it incredibly easy to use, it cleaned and deodorized the carpet. The brush lifted the carpet pile and the whole area looks like new carpet. I combined the pet stain and odor remover along with the oxygen cleaner and the carpet has a nice fresh scent to it now. Clean up was so easy. I just rinsed the flex hose and containers with fresh clean water and all of the pet hair and dirty water came flushing out. I'm not sure why some of the people complained about it leaking and the cleanup, I had none of those problems. I highly recommend this machine for anyone with pets. It's one of the most efficient, compact carpet cleaners I've ever owned."
2,Save your money for a Professional carpet clean !,Just bought this item today. It tries to do a good job but just doesn't. I had a couple of pet urine stains on the carpet that was revealed by a hand-held black light (so it had been there a while) the unit worked on it 2X with Oxy2 Gen and all the cleaning solutions to specifications with probably only a 20% max reduction in visible stain (as viewed under black light). Granted these are pet urine stain testings only (which aren't surface visible in normal daylight) but this really tells the story of what this unit can saturate and lift out of a carpet. In my opinion it isn't much. I also felt I had to put some weight on the top of the unit for it to get a good vacume seal and make sure the bristles of the brush actually impacted the carpet. Frankly IMO it's a toy. If your serious about real cleaning you'll never be happy with this. Sorry I wanted to be a believer but my verdict : RETURN TO SENDER.
5,Excellent!!,This thing rocks!! It does EXACTLY what it says it does. I've never had a stain that it didn't obliterate!! Get it:)
3,Spot Bot Leaves Its Mark,"I have to say the spot bot does work well in getting spots/stains out, but it also leaves a circular marking where it has been used and this is no matter how clean the actual rest of the carpet is so in my case I found this very disappointing."
4,Fast and Easy,"I love my dog, but sometimes he doesn't wait until morning to go outside. Up until I got this little cleaner, I had to drag out my big Oreck carpet shampooer, fill it with water, attach the shampoo and the water container, clean the spot, towel up the excess water, dismantle the shampooer, empty the water reservoirs, dry off the brushes, and store the cleaner back in the garage. With this cleaner I added a little detergent to the water, set the brush on the spot, hit one button, watched TV for six minutes, then emptied the dirty water. It did all the work.Amazing!"
5,It works great,I love my spot bot I can set it and go do something else in the house while it cleans the spot. We have several bad stains in our carpets and it is taking them out some have been there for several years.My husband bought it for me for Christmas and today was the 1st time I got to use it got it cheaper than they are sold in stores and that is great this day and time with our bad ecomony.Patricia Freeman
5,The best new appliance ever ... especiallly for pet stains,"Okay. So I have quite a few pets - dogs and cats. Occassionally the dogs make a mistake and every now and then one of the cats throws up (trying to hack up the inevitable hair ball). I used to spend a lot of time on my hands and knees scrubbing these stains or pulled out my big, heavy carpet cleaner. Sometimes a disheartening amount of work.The SpotBot makes clean up really fast and easy. If there is a spill or a pet accident, all you have to do is put detergent and water into the cleanser tank, plug it in, put the brushes over the stain ... then walk away! When you come back, the stain is completely gone. Cleaning up the machine afterword takes seconds.This is the the best appliance we have purchased this year."
3,Spot Bot--It Is What it Says,"Spot Bot is exactly what it says...a good product that removes stains 6"" in circumference. This is not something you could use for big jobs or whole rooms, but if you have a 17-year old basset hound with bladder issues like me, Spot Bot does the trick, in a quick and efficient manner.A bit pricey for what it does, I would still recommend it. Again for multiple stains or big spots, you may want to go for a traditional carpet cleaner or you will be moving the Spot Bot around the room for quite a while! This is the Dirt Devil of carpet cleaners. Overall, good item for small, constant stains."
5,Can't Live Without!,"I can't believe how amazing this machine is! I cannot live without it now. I just tried it out and have gotten 2 cat barf stains (food, grass) and a set-in coffee stain. I used the hand held tool to suction up the rest of the liquid and it dried up pretty fast. Yes, it does use up alot of the formula but it's well worth it and has gotten the stains out on the first try. For the 2 cat barf stains I used the Surface Stain option and for the coffee stain I used the Set-In Stain option which worked wonderfully. I highly recommend this machine. I know it's kind of pricey but I bought it on Kohl's website because they were offering free shipping and I also had a coupon code for 20% off a purchase."
4,So much easier than the Bissel Little Green Machine,"I bought this to replace my old ""Little Green Machine"". It does use a lot of solution during the automated cleaning cycle, so I recommend using the manual operation for small spots. It is so much easier to clean than the older machine and it works great at cleaning my dogs little ""mistakes""."
1,not pleased,"I only used this product 4 or 5 times and the unit stopped working. The motor runs but the suction has stopped. I felt it cleaned the carpet ok, although I needed to do repeat rinsing to get all the solution up out of the carpet fibers. For the money spent I was very disappointed."
3,It's alright,"This product works ok for us but it absolutely stained our light colored berber carpeting. We have cats who have hair balls on the carpeting, they aren't considerate enough to save it for the wood flooring :). With cleanup then using the stain remover, it left a lot of water still in the carpet and left a dark stain the exact shape of the head.It did do a great job on our area rugs and our couch's upholstery. So obviously this product is hit or miss depending on whatever item you use it.It's not a total loss for us but sometimes I wonder if it was worth buying."
1,Leak Bot 1200,"The machine did an acceptable job removing pet stains during the first four uses, and had I written a review then it would have been 4 stars. When shopping for the product, I wondered why Bissell made so many products that appear to be the same as this machine. Now I am sure that is just a marketing ploy. When you don't have luck with one unit, you spend a fer dollars more and buy the ""better"" one. The cleaning solution tank leaks constantly. Considering the high cost of the solution, I find this to be an unacceptable trait of the machine. The unit is currently 2 months old, and I am now only able to use it on one location before having to refill the solution tank."
3,circles,"This machine works well on a nice clean carpet but if you have any allover aging on the rug, it leaves light circles that never blend in. I did love the handheld hose cleaner brush but that broke pretty quickly. It will not turn off/change method back to regular cleaning.It is easy to use but not when broken!"
5,SpotBot Rocks,"Our old SpotBot finally died after many years, so we purchased this model as a replacement. We have two hairball-loving cats and three kids, so this is a necessity in our house.I have nothing negative to say about this, and it seems to do even a better job than our old SpotBot. In general, we have had very good luck with Bissell products, and this SpotBot is no exception.Considering the cost of professional carpet cleaning, the SpotBot quickly pays for itself.Bottom line: the product works as advertised, gets the nasty stains out of your carpet, is easy to use, and makes cleaning up nasty messes a bit more fun (if that's possible)."
5,"Light carpet, small dark stains all around","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. We have a light carpet throughout our home and a dog and baby. There are stains on the carpet that I have tried to get out with countless other items and they always came back. Finally something that does the trick, and DOES IT FOR ME! Worth every penny!It does leave the spot wet, so I do my spots at night then go to bed. When I get up the spots are dry."
5,My Life is Made Easier!!,"My Little Green Clean machine that I bought in 1993 died, and I needed a replacement immediately. I have an older cat who has ""issues"" about twice a week. He usually has his ""issues"" while we're at work, so it gets pretty set in by the time we home. The auto clean feature is awesome! It's completely removes the stains; however, it does the carpet a wetter than I like, so I use the manual hose to suck up remaining moisure."
2,Read description carefully,"When I ordered this item I didn't realize that it can in two weight capacities. Under the ""Product Features"" it says ""Size: 200-340 LBS"" but it is not one of the bullet items and is in grey text; so look carefully.I bought this for my mother-in-law who is a petite 90 lbs so this unit flung her out of the chair and would not let her back down. I got this because she was starting to have a hard time getting out of her chair. Immediately after I received the product and found I had ordered incorrectly she got sick and by the time I gave it a second thought it was too late to return so now I have a chair lift for a large person in a family of small framed folk so I guess I'll be donating this to charity."
1,UPLIFT UPEASY CUSHION - Waste of Money,"This item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly. Also it does not work well at all. If you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least. Many times it stays flat and when it does ""rise"" it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs. I would have returned the item, but I left it for my mother when I had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time I returned my 30 day window was closed. DO NOT BUY, you will regret it if you do. I won't even put this item in a yard sale, because I would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it."
5,Very helpful,I recently had my knee replaced and only had chairs that were hard to get up from. This has helped me a lot.
4,Pros & Cons,"Let me start with the pros:It smells AMAZING!Feels like silk going on.You can see the little exfoliating beads and it does gently take off dead skin.Doesn't make skin oily or dry.Only one con, but it was a dealbreaker for me:Breaks out my chin and forehead :(I will not use it on my face for this reason, but I do use it on my body - makes me feel super clean, soft, and fresh.Yes, I did try to let my face ""adjust"". After 2 months of using, I was tired of new daily breakouts. I won't repurchase, but I would definetly try a bliss bodywash in the future."
5,Love the Bliss Foaming Face Wash!,I bought the face wash while on a cruise in April 12. I love the smell of it and how my face feels after washing with the exfoliating beads in it. I found a new bottle through Amazon when it started running low. It lasts a long time and isn't very expensive. I will continue to use this every day.
1,no me gustó,"Después de leer los reviews me decidí a probar este foaming wash, qué horrible, huele como a dulce ni se siente que limpie, no me gustó nada. Si quieren probar un buen foaming wash prueben mousse radiance de lancome, ese si es bueno, deja la piel súper suave y huele delicioso."
4,awsome album,This is a great album the vesions of the songs sre really cool and alot different from the regular way they play them
1,Wrong size sent,"There was nothing wrong with the quality of the individual product, but unfortunately the wrong size was sent and there is no recourse to have the product swapped.Customer service and follow up is badly lacking as there should be an option to return goods or obtain a credit."
5,great,Great for me pounding some body's head in. The price you couldnt beat either! I will order more soon as i can.
4,great!,Bought them for a halloween costume- but they are such good quality- my 10 year old now wants to get punching bag!
4,Perfect Youth Glove,I bought these gloves for my 6 yr old son who recently started boxing. His trainer was impressed with the gloves and recommended them to other partents looking for a quality youth sized set of boxing gloves.These are a professional set of gloves in a hard-to-find lightweight size for younger kids and I would definitely recommend them to others looking for an alternative to the generic youth boxing gloves found in the the toy isles.
5,Youth Training Gloves,"Bought these for my great nephew (5 years old) - he loves wearing them when he's playing on his WII (or however that word is spelled).I'm sure they outlast his wanting to ""play"" boxing."
5,Heavy duty!!,"I got 2 sets of these for my grandsons, they came today, tried them on myself, and they will be a perfect fit for the 10 yr olds!!I even punched the wall a couple of times, very sturdy!!!"
5,Monastic awareness,"This book really helped give me an insight into monastic life and the discipline required to participate on a lay basis. I particularly enjoyed the chapters about Faith and Prayer. I highly recommend this book for all those attracted to the idea of carrying out a ""retreat"" and for those seeking a deeper involvement in their own spiritual development. I read the book in a few days."
1,Read Wisdom From The Monastery Instead Of This Book,"I purchased ""Wisdom From The Monastery"". WFTM covers a lot compared to this book. Reading WFTM, one could start a program for himself. This books is like use and throw product. WFTM is like reading a book, keeping it in the shelf. Reading again and again.Only the cover of this book looks good. On seeing the cover, i thought this book will be equal to the quality of WFTMIf i had a rating below 1, i would rate it 0.75"
1,Don't waste your money,I could have taken the whole box of pills and still would want to eat a entire pizza THUMBS DOWN
1,I bought 3 cd's at the time,"this one was not the best one. For stress reduction, I would recommend a CD by this same author called ""Meditations for Calmness, Aweness and Love""."
1,Not for me,This meditation left me more annoyed than relaxed.Was not quite what I expected and I won't use it.
1,Hiss The Traitor Spy,"Interesting account to read; however, read it knowing you are reading the words of a Communist spy.The previous review makes it seem as though Hiss was exposed as a non-spy because he was only charged with perjury. However, he/she fails to relay the information that the charges for treason had gone beyond the statute of limitations. Hiss could now only be convicted as a perjurer. His lie was that he said he did not know Whittaker Chambers. When it was revealed that he did know Chambers, it was revealed that he was a spy as Chambers had also been a Soviet spy.Nice work of whitewash. Hiss was guilty of treason, but because the statute of limitations had run out, he could not be convicted of it. A shameful man but an interesting book to read if you know this about the traitor Hiss."
5,Wailing Souls rule,"Apart from the Jimmy Cliff track which is, what can one say...an anthem? a classic? on a planet by itself? this CD is worth buying just for the 3 Wailing Souls tracks. Wailing Souls is an under-appreciated reggae band. These 3 tracks are far out there. The rest is okay. JC and the WS make this soundtrack CD what it is - 5 stars with bells on."
5,Great soundtrack!,"I used to own this soundtrack years ago and lost it somehow. I really loved it back then and for some reason recently was thinking about it again and made the purchase. This soundtrack has many catchy tunes! They are all fun, uplifting songs that put you in a good mood! I've owned several soundtracks in my life and this has always been one of my favorites. I loved the movie and the soundtrack captures it's essence :) Highly recommend if you like a more ""modern"" reggae sound especially."
5,Twila Live Is Top Notch!!!,"I personally love Twila's live music. I prefer her live music to that of the studio. One great aspect of this album is David Cleveland's guitar playing on the album. Enjoy his slide guitar on These Are the Days of Elijah, to his screaming solo in God Is In Control. Twila Paris sounds best in a live concert where her greatest fans are there too. This concert was not announced on her web site. I've been to five Twila Concerts so I know my favorite concerts are when the public are invited. Having said that, Have you heard Messiah? That's a great song!!!!!I wish Twila would keep putting out new material on a regular basis. Such a formula makes for personal revival in the soul!! Get this cd and put it on your ipod and then listen! You will be happy to hear He is Exalted!!!! It's a jam on this album!!Charles DeWeese Brooklyn, NY"
5,Great Praise Album,"Put on your headphones, turn up the volume and just Praise the Lord, this is a prayerful and spirited album well worth the money."
5,Great work of art!,"I love, love, love this CD! Twila Paris sings like no one else and brings her love of the Lord to a new height with these songs. I love the older ones, as well as the new like ""These Are The Days of Elijah"". A great CD that I've used to begin bible studies with...I just can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed this CD."
2,Twila sounds bored............UPDATED,"Margie: Yes, I listened to this and she sounds BORED!Get it through your thick skull, she (twila)is jumping on the worship bandwagon trying to generate a college fund.First off, do we really need another ""worship"" CD from ANYONE?Enough already!That being said, I am a HUGE TP fan but this release leaves me wanting more. I have seen her live over 20 times and she never sounded THIS bad. While her voice is flawless as ever, I just think she sounds bored and un-inspired.Listen to her read her canned response to the audience, I can tell she is not into it, even her vocals sound dull and flat.Twila, go back to the studio and do what you do best.If you want to do a live CD, that is fine go back and get some tapes from the ""same girl"" tour or even ""True North"" and release some of THAT material.We love you Twila, we just know you can do better than this.PS: I really should give this a one star but I cant, not for Twila!"
4,Excellent Spiritual Exploration,"I have not honestly ever considered how Star Wars and my own spiritual path could ever be related. But in this novel, Jones helps me realize how the Star Wars saga helped to foster my spirituality at a young age and helped me gain a better appreciation of my own faith. This novel was a wonderful, serious, and interesting read. I highly recommend it to those who seek something more out of their Star Wars movie experience and would like to deepen their faith."
3,Hawk,"Anyone who's lived in, or lived near Gainesville FL, knows of Paines Prairie. It's a spot on the earth that tells you what it's about. Mr. Crews wisely uses the prairie as a backdrop/character and goes from there. Read it!"
5,Breathtaking!,"Jay McDaniel does the near impossible with this long awaited book on spirituality: he manages to speak to our minds, our souls, our hearts, and our culture in one integrated, beautiful work. He speaks from the perspective of a Christian process theology which lends itself both to the mystical beauty of the contemplative movement and all the loving kindness of Buddhism. His critique of our consumer culture does not end with what's wrong, but offers an alternative that is rich, compelling, and Christian in the best sense of the word. I found his original, imaginative language to describe God (e.g.Open Space, The Freshness Deep Down, Sacred Whole)refreshing in a world of burned out images and buzz words. Like looking at piece of art, there were breathless moments in the reading of this book. A true masterpiece in the field of spirituality!"
2,This is not the foot-stompin' John Lee Hooker I love :-(,"Boring, poor performances that drag on and on, not the (solo) foot-stompin' tasteful guitar playing and singing I love from this man. Perhaps there is little video of his good stuff. These videos did not interest me in the least."
3,it's good,"this is a pretty good documentary on mr. hooker. i would like to have more older archive material though. most of the material was from the '80s and '90s. i didn't think much of the live set with foghat and thought paul butterfield's harp playing pretty mediocre. charlie musselwhite is interviewed, but he does not play, unfortunately. what is strangely missing from this dvd is any material with or interviewing anyone from canned heat, tony mcphee and the groundhogs, john mayall or eric burdon. they have all been heavily influenced and played with sir john. this is a good dvd but hardly a definitive one."
2,Barely Adequate Test Kit For Use With Cupramine,"I purchased this to test copper levels when treating for Ich in my marine isolation tank with Seachem Cupramine. As this test kit is also manufactured by Seachem, it is the one they obviously recommend.First, the test is incredible easy to use. Collect a sample, add 2 drops, and stir with a stir stick coated in a second chemical.The results are based on how blue the water changes. It can be very difficult to distinguished anything between .4 and .6 mg/L. The directions for Cupramine stress that a level of .5 is desired. .25mg/L is below the therapeutic threshold and above .6 can be very harmful to the fish. Given the narrow acceptable range, I would have liked to see a better resolution from their recommended test kit.Finally, the box states 75 tests. Given the incredibly small amount of the dust chemical you coat the the stir stick with, 75 really seems to be stretching it. Just a guess, but I'm thinking 25-35 tests."
2,Not really a fan,"I know seachem makes serious level test kits and products, but I'm not crazy about the idea of it giving you a tiny capsule of powder as one of the things you add to the test, yet for the amount you're supposed to add, it tells you, ""lightly cover the dip stick in poweder"". How much is that exactly?? How am I supposed to know. With somethign like this where I'm testing the copper level of my quarantine tank to medicate fish, I have to know exactly how much medication is in the water. A tad more copper can easily be toxic so I need definite, clear test results. And this didn't cut it. Back to red sea for this test."
2,Too sharp to use casually,"As for most casual cooks, I take pleasure in preparing food for a few friends. So I usually have a few glasses of scotch when I cook, no big deal. So to prevent any accidents, its important for a knife to have excellent balance and feel, and not be too sharp. I'm not a circus performer or a knife juggler, so I don't have the kind of dexterity needed to handle an extremely sharp knife after I've had a few.Of the five times I have used this knife, I cut myself four of those times. If I shell out the money for a supposedly high-quality knife, I expect it to be effective, but forgiving.Another gripe of mine is that I have found the knife to be completely ineffective for certain uses, such as cleaning and skinning wild game. Again, if I'm going to pay premium prices, I expect the product to be versatile."
5,Great Toy- Lots of Fun and Interactive,"My 2 year old daughter loves this toy.She plays with it all the time.She loves to blow Elmo's Nose and check his boo boo on his knee.Elmo Sings a funny song about going to the doctors.It real cute and my daughter claps when its over.I would recommend this toy.We plan on bringing this toy to the doctors office, for our next visit."
4,HIT with 2 y/o daughter!,"this was a major hit for my little girl's second birthday. my mom got a set - the potty elmo and this one. she loves both. they are very funny! She takes them everywhere with her. she calls them elmo twins. it just has a few phrases - so of course they get a bit repetitive / annoying but hey- its elmo, you gotta love that furry red soft cuddly guy :) the kids do anyway so its worth every penny and minute of annoyance :)"
4,What is Elmo Saying?,"My son got this Elmo for his birthday and he absolutely loves him, my husband and I are both nurses, so of course we liked it. I'd give it 5 stars if I knew what it was saying... there is a part where he says, ""Elmo has a booboo on his foot..."" and you check it, then Elmo says, ""Thank you... Elmo's much better... no more booboo from Elmo's ________???????"" What the heck is Elmo saying? Anyone know?"
5,Doctor Elmo to the rescue!,"This wonderful Elmo, along with the DVD Elmo Visits the Doctor, have been such a powerful tool at making doctor visits easier. We are also at the stage where my daughter is OBSESSED with boo boos - so she was very excited to see that Elmo had a bandage on. Wish there were more things to do with this Elmo, but my daughter is just tickled with him. Any Elmo fan will just adore him!"
2,made in china,"this toy is made in china, with all the recalls of lead paint on toys from China I never let my children play with this. It is cute, but the eyes on Elmo are painted so I have it tucked away in the toy box incase they find out a solution to the lead paint scares. I like the idea that it could help alleviate a child's fear of the dr.Save your money & buy american"
2,ANNOYING TOY!!!!!!!,"My daughter got this toy for her birthday . . . yesterday! This toy is soooooo annoying! Over and over again Elmo asks you to check his bandage, his heart, his temperature, and to wipe his nose. Also, I think his nose is hard to wipe. You actually have to squeeze his nose for him to acknowledge that you've wiped it. Checking his heart is the same way. You have to push hard on his chest. My daughter can handle checking his temperature and his bandage, but cannot do the other two things I just mentioned. It is frustrating for her and she brings the toy to me and asks me to wipe his nose. I wish I could take this toy back, but too late. It has been opened and used. What a waste of $20. This toy will probably end up in my yard sale or at the bottom of my daughter's toy box where we don't have to hear it very often."
4,A Wes Anderson Fan's Review,"I think Wes Anderson (or whoever choses the songs) creates the perfect soundtracks. I purchased this album after owning the Life Aquatic soundtrack. The music on this album is in between Dave Brubeck and Bob James. Although I'm just a music fan, not a hardcore jazz aficionado. If you were only luke warm about the two tracks on the Life Aquatic soundtrack, I would hesitate to buy it. If you are somewhat interested in jazz and like what you've heard already, you will love this album. I also strongly recommend anything by Seu Jorge, who sung five David Bowie songs in Portuguese on the soundtrack."
2,not entirely practical,"The book focuses on a specific type of tenant (credit worthy) and a specific type of rental property (single-family), and pretty much dismisses all other avenues of approaching rental property and tenants, which, in turn, dismisses a great deal of landlords. Finding an adequate pool of sellers who are desperate and willing to accept the buyer's terms is hardly an easy or realistic prospect. I'm a successful landlord, and I don't fit the book's ideal. Though the book's specific strategy might not be readily applied (out-dated and too narrow), some of the general information that relates to rental property and tenants is good and can be applied to most situations."
1,Covers a niche market: a niche you would not want to go...,"The book would hardly have any value to you unless to plan to buy hundreds and hundreds of cheap houses in communities ""nowhere near the universities"" and rent them out to ""meek"" people who ""work with their hands"" and do not have time for ""annoying questions"". Then, just ""keep them in awe of you"", and collect the rent ruthlessly. I am just starting out as a landlord. I wish I had not read this book..."
2,"Heartily Concur with ""Obnoxious Ego"" Comments","Seems to me the ONLY way these people make money is due to an ultratight market with minimal competition. Buisness dealings aside, these people actually manage to insult me with their mode of dealing with people. The fact that they are ""proud"" of their system really makes me wonder...either they're entirely clueless as to basic respect for another human being, or it's some strange S&M; thing. Seriously, they strictly advocate NOT letting the lease contract ""out of their sight"". I would NEVER do buisness with ANYONE who wouldn't let me review any potential agreement, and it makes me wonder what the response would be if the tenant wanted a copy of the signed document (which I provide as a matter of routine to my tenants).So, here I sit wishing Amazon had a content warranty."
3,out of date but still informative,the buying concept is years behind and out of touch but the overall concept is still good.
1,Pass this fictional trash by...,"The methods described in this book sound foolproof. First, find tenants with stable jobs, no self-esteem, and with no clue whatsoever about economics. Then get them to rent from you under the most oppressive of leases.The book assumes a market where good housing at a bargain price is plentiful, yet demand for rentals far outstrips supply. At best this is a paradox. There is no way the vast majority of renters would accept such outlandish terms that the Milins propose unless vacancies were virtually nil.The financial information was quasi-useful and the only semi-bright spot in an otherwise very dim book.The Milins come off as complete 'holes to deal with as buyers, sellers, and landlords. I'm surprised they find enough who will do business with them to keep FIVE houses occupied, much less the hundreds they brag about having.This book belongs in the fiction section. Those who choose a non-fictional approach would be much better served by other choices."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Just dont buy this book. I purchased it because it advertised that it focused on managing 1 to 4 properties, the kind of book I was looking for. Turns out it's not. The only valuable information it presents is common sense, and the book repeats those concepts again and again. Information in this book is outdated, purposefully exaggerated at times to prove a point, and annoyingly self conflicting. I agree with the other reviewer who said you feel dirty after reading this book - don't bother."
1,Dynamic Duo?,"There are many awesome books from Amazon but this is not one of them. This book is very informative, interesting as well as enlightening though how they, the authors, think and act.People are not animals. Where is dignity? This book gives landlords a bad name and the industry of renting.The cover is well done and that is misleading. The contents is degrading and lacks soul. Ethics?The majority of landlords do not run their rentals like this."
1,Very Outdated,This book is very very old and has no (or very little) relevance to today's economy. Am sorry I paid for this.
5,Simply Beautiful!,"$42.00 for an Amethyst ring? I thought for sure it would be a little on the cheap flimsy side. I'm happy to report I was 100% wrong in that assumption!This ring it gorgeous!Like another reviewer said, it probably would be a little large for someone with smaller hands. I have large hands with long fingers and it looks great (I think).I will definitely purchase more jewelry from Eve's Addiction!"
5,Nice Quality Paper but issues with package size,"Looks like they've fixed the title since I was sent what was supposed to have been 6 pads but was only one. Thankfully I had purchased from Amazon and they immediately reshipped... one pad. Back to Amazon, they gave me a pro-rated refund (which was fine with me) and it looks like they fixed the title. My suggestion - if you think you are buying 6, order from Amazon so you can be sure they stand behind the product!Since they fixed the quantity in the title and it is really good quality paper which is why I went ahead with the 5 stars, the actual product does deserve that. Just wish they'd fix the cost to reflect a proper price for a single pad!"
3,Get the newer one,"I'd recommend getting the newer, much better version of the Wampa atWampa With Hoth Cave (Hoth Attack) - The Empire Strikes Back Deluxe Star Wars Set"
5,Wampa Atack,"recently receivied this beast pack over the weekend and i loved it!! although the pack comes with a luke skywalker figure, i mainly bought it for the Wampa figure. the wampa is highly detailed, and personaly i think the power of the force edition of the wampa is more detailed than any other wampa figure made. it has a removable right arm for when luke attacks it. also if you pull back on his left arm and release it is his ""attack feature"". although the legs do not move at all it is still beter than the 2007 wampa released. the entire figure is hard plastic not cheap hollow rubber limbs. the face is detailed nicely as well and has lickliness of the wampa. all in all a really great wampa figure. the luke was detailed as well and even had the attack marks printed on his face and came with his lightsaber. i am a fan of the wampa and it was the best part of the beast pack!!"
4,Absolutely joyful and totally entertaining with mystery.,"As entertaining as any of Mark Twain's works. Fun for all ages. Great stroy and lessons in life as well as Twain's great gift for humor, subtle and obvious. Totally entertaining with enough drama to keep your interest. Great for entertainment, education or teaching."
1,Great Book Marred By An Absolutely Terrible Introduction,"If you buy this book, dive straight into the Twain works themselves and completely skip the introduction which contains such inane and unintelligible howlers as ""Mark Twain has proved to be a one book author"" and ""every reader of Huckleberry Finn feels that the end of the novel is artistically mismanaged"" and ""Mark Twain's difficulties in writing the fully articulated novel consonant with the mood into which his mature experience had precipitated him are most evident in the construction of his eponymous hero.""I have no idea who R.D. Gooder is, but all I can say is that I am glad I did not have any literature professors like him. Stick with the unadulterated versions of Twain such asThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Cambridge World Classics) Special Kindle Enabled Features (Mark Twain Collection)andThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Cambridge World Classics Edition) Special Kindle Enabled Features (Mark Twain Collection)"
5,easier and quicker than the other brand,"This version of the nitrate test is easier and quicker than the AP version. Two squirts of aquarium water in the test well two drops of reagent and one scoop of powder and a small stir and it gives results in five minutes. Way better than the AP version where you have to shake the bottles and tube for a few minutes. Plus you can do up to six tests at a time if you want or do simultaneous nitrite and nitrate tests at once. As for the other reviewer saying it gets contaminated, that's just if you are too lazy to wash the test card well."
2,that club mix,i was quite gutted that this cd contained a lot of tunes that i all ready have on other cds i felt that it was a waste of time to be honest
4,Hopefully an English translation soon,"This book by French journalist Laurent is very informative. It gives a detailed description of the ties between the Bushes and Bin Ladens, but not in the funny and slanted Michael Moore way or the sometimes overpopular style of Kitty Kelley.Besides the gruesome ties between the oilmen in Texas and the Middle East there are some chapters on the Bush government and its hawks. It's now quite old so some members of cabinet have already left, but their role is still clear.I've seen this book in French, German and Dutch. Good read"
3,Good background on Hailwood,Well written by someone who knew Hailwood well. I enjoyed the fast pace and interesting vignettes. No threat for a Pulitzer but a good read.
5,Good total body workout,"This video is approximately 45 minutes long. There are about 5-6 circuits (4 moves each) and they are repeated 2x so there is no boredom. Each of the ciruits have compound moves so you are working upper and lower at the same time. There are some really unique moves in this video. It is challenging and gets your heartrate up, but there is no dread factor. I really like their their teaching style. A good add to your workout rotation."
2,Very booooooooring,"I bought this dvd based on the fact that it affiliated with the great jane fonda. However it is so boring, i bearly went through it once and shall not do it again. The hosts might be good trainers in a gym, however they do. Ot hve any idea how to be on a video. The routine is not homogenous and there is almost no music. There are definitely better options out there."
5,GREAT WORKOUT,"I have several Jane Fonda's workouts, and I was curious about the new ones, and they have not disappointed me at all; Katrina and Karena introduces us a workout in which you work every part of your body and get sweat in less than an hour, I love that."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping this DVD would be worthwhile because Jane Fonda has always produced good workouts. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Katrina and Karen are amateur personal trainers (at best). I am not even sure Katrina and Karen completed a practice session before filming the DVD. The actually workout itself isn't terrible, if you can get past the actors' performance of the exercises. I am really surprised Jane Fonda would put her name on this video. If you are looking for a serious workout with a professional trainer check out Kelly Coffey-Meyer 30-minutes to fitness programs."
1,Thye've changed!,I use to use these all the time in the Motorcycle biz for fork boots. Now the company has ruined them for that by slitting the bottoms. I cannot understand the logic behind this...a once great product is now a piece of crap.
3,"A nice ""little"" book","This is a good book to have if you are looking for something to give you a refresher or an overview of a topic you are already familiar with. The book is broken into sections such as materials, techniques and composition, along with a few others. Each section has many topics listed. For example the techniques section has 43 things listed such as blending, contour drawing, shading and many others. However, each topic only has one page (some have 2 or 3 but the majority only have 1) and this is a small book, you can easily tuck it into to a backpack or purse. If you are looking for a detailed explanation of a certian topic you won't find it in here. This is not a critisim of the book, there is a great deal of information packed into it, but I would not suggest it as a beginner's book as it won't teach you ""how"" to draw. However, if you have some experiance in drawing, this is a nice book to add to your collection as there are some interesting ideas in it."
5,Outstanding reading material!,"For all those people who enjoy Chuck Norris as a martial artist and performer, this book will draw you to the next level. With his life story you will really begin to respect him as a person. He has faced many obstacles in life. This man truely is a overcomer. A wonderful role model. At times I laughed out loud, and other times I was blown away and stopped in my tracks just to think about the personal depth of his story. This is a must read for everyone. I plan to read it again and again."
4,"Chuck Norris does not write books, he looks at them and they write themselves.","I liked this book because it is a simple all American story of a man from humble beginnings who rose to be a legend. A serviceman who took up martial arts as a way to pass the time while stationed in Korea, returns home to share his knowledge of the art/sport with others and rose to athletic fame as one of the best fighters of his generation. From there to movie, tv and a life that I believe he still pinches himself every morning just to see if he is awake and it is all real.Mr. Norris seems to be the kind of man you would like to spend an afternoon with at one of his martial arts schools have a good work out. Later you could sit with him and have a beer, and enjoy this humble man.the book is a simple, enjoyable read about the life of a man who just can't believe he is thought of as the dealiest man in the universe."
3,Not a big del,"My daughter was interested in his story, when that whole Chuck Norris joke book was popular....it is collecting dust. Oh well...."
5,All you want to know about Maui and more.,"I bought this book prior to our umpteenth trip to Maui because we wanted to do something different for a change and it seemed to have good advice on off- the- beaten- track accommodations, restaurants, experiences. It never disappointed us. As a professional travel consultant, I now refer to it with regularity to help plan trips for my clients who also want to do something ""different"" on the island. Highly recommended."
5,Paper Airplane Fun,"Great book, planes that really fly well, lots of fun with my grandson and he can make them too!!"
1,ripped off models,"I have paper aircraft books by Paul jackson and Campbell morris published years before this book and to my astonishment there are models in this book ripped off from those aforementioned authors, some with very slight changes to get away from copyright infringement. I don't appreciate forking out money for a book like this to find some of the models are in other books I have already. imho this reduced this authors credibility a great deal."
1,Useless,The instructions are impossible for me to understand let alone a 8 year old. Not user friendly at all. Big waste of money.
4,Good fun,We've owned this book for two years now and our boys get it out every now and then to make airplanes. There are a lot of different styles that they can easily make.
4,He enjoys it!,My nephew is eleven years old. He had to have help with the directions but once the planes were made he thought they were awesome. He hasn't taken them outside yet because it's been damp and cold. He loves flying them indoors.
5,The BEST Paper Airplane Book,"I am a Science teacher I designed a Science Camp for the school district I work for. One of the days was devoted to the science of flight and we used paper airplanes as models. Originally, I had purchased 4 different paper airplane books (including this one). But, when the time came around and it was 'Paper Airplane Day' during our camp, this was the book I used.The other books were ok, but many of the planes seemed to be very complex to make, many also involving irregular sizes of paper. I also try to keep my Science lessons simple - I wanted something the students could take home and start making right away. Not only did the Klutz book offer great, easy to make airplanes, but it also contained easy to understand explanations of the principles of flight (as well as some group games to play with paper airplanes.I HIGHLY recommend this book and I give it a solid teacher endorsement!"
5,My son loves this,My oldest boy who is 10 loves playing with this. His friends all have the book as well and they make dozens of them!
5,Super product,This is a fabulous book for girls and boys alike. We have made 4 planes so far and they fly great. You do have to be exact on the folds but directions are easy to follow with lots of helpful hints. Parents may need to assist younger kids but this is good for many ages.
5,Fun for Everyone,This may have been a Christmas gift for my 11 year old (bought one for my 13 year old step son too) but the whole family has had tons of fun with this book.
5,GREAT Gift for a Grandson,"He took it out to my back porch and immediately started making and throwing airplanes. I thought he'd have to read it first for a while but no, he got it right away. That was a year ago and he can still make paper planes that will fly further than anyones. He is just 9 years old. The great thing about this book was that it had the beautiful printed paper right inside so he could start right away."
4,An amazing book for beginners!!,"This is a great book for the whole family. Directions are fairly easy but once you get the hang of it, it is smooth flying. The professional plane flys up to the sky then glides down like a real airplane. The hurricane is not an airplane but if you throw it straight, it will soar in the air then go down. My favorite part of the directions is how to fly the planes. You've got to buy this book!!!"
5,Great Summer Fun,My 12 year old son and I had a great time making these airplanes. The book is very easy to follow and very well constructed. We started out folding the planes with regular printer paper before using the decorated paper included with the book. This allowed us to make sure the folds were done right. We spent many afternoons throwing these planes outdoors until my arm was sore. The book also showed the slight tweeks and modifcations that can help to fine tune paper airplanes for optimum flight or stunts. Great how to book.
5,a major eye-opener,"The Passion Conspiracy by Dr. Randy Weiss is a major eye-opener. Every Christian who wants to understand the facts behind the passion of the Christ (i.e., the person Jesus Christ, not the film) should interact with this text. Dr. Weiss brings some biblical facts to light that too many Christians for far too long have simply overlooked. Paying special attention to the details of Scriptures in light of his Hebrew background, Dr. Weiss has done the church a favor by writing this text."
2,Beware of other reviewers,The book was so-so. More far fetched than Gibson's movie. Interesting point is that the three reviews on here are from the same day in the same year. Authors often have multiple id's to write reviews themselves. There are better ways to do this than to have it so obvious. LOL
2,Misleading product information,"The product specs say that it has English subtitles. When I got my order and tested some of the discs, I discovered that there were only French and Spanish subtitles. How very disappointing!"
3,A good show for all ages,Chris burke and Kellie Martin are excellent and Monique Lanier is good but I feel Tracey Needham has morespark when she take over in the second season
5,I LOVE THIS SHOW! It's quality television you just don't see anymore!,"When this show was on TV, I was about 2 years younger than ""Becca""--and my name was Becca. I so idolized and identified with her, and so I was hooked.I think the show takes several episodes to ""find it's stride,"" but then it's really rolling.It teaches without preaching, and the focus of the show is always on ""doing the right thing.""I would buy the rest of the seasons--RIGHT NOW--if they were all released.For quality, meaningful, wholesome television, this show can't be beat (except, maybe, Little House on the Prairie!)"
5,"LOVED THIS SHOW, will buy dvd","I watched this tv series faithfully when it was on television. I am very excited that it is offered on dvd. I would buy all the seasons. It is an awesome show, it shows the versatality of a family with a down syndrome family member. Chris Burke (who plays Corky) did a great job. I had the opportunity to meet Chris, and he is a very nice man who has done very well, as have his parents raising him. I have a son with down syndrome and very happy to see this on dvd. It shows the audience that indeed life goes on, when you have a child who has down syndrome or other types of challenges. Can't wait to buy mine!!!"
3,A good book by a great thinker,"&#65279;Some excellent material on `Suffering and Evil,' `Abortion,' and `Homosexuality.' The final chapter on `Christ, the Only Way' deals directly with the pluralistic mind set that defines our culture today. He speaks of how in the past before explorers ventured out and discovered other countries it was easy to believe there is a god who was over their own little tribe and created the whole universe. Now, as we see different cultures all over the world that have never heard of Jesus it seems hard to believe that the exclusive view of Christianity is true. Dr. Craig shows how weak this reasoning is in an intelligent philosophical manner."
5,William Lane Craig for a Popular Audience,"Bill Craig once told me that he has trouble writing at a popular level. Anyone familiar with his work will immediately understand why. However, in this book he succeeds admirably. This is not a book to shy away from by any means. It isn't a comprehensive treatise, but he does address issues that sometimes are glossed over by Christian thinkers, such as failure and unanswered prayer. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone who spends part of Sunday morning in a Christian church pew."
1,Stupid,This has got to be one of the worst books i`ve ever read.....What Craig fails to realize is - Scientific evidence trumps 'philosophical' arguments' every day of the week. I'd love to see Matt Dillahunty debate Craig. Matt has the experience (no pun intended) and appears to have a good understanding of Craig's handful of well worn' arguments.But Craig shields himself by demanding that whomever he chooses to debate must literally be 'this tall to ride'...it just shows there is no real argument for religion....so all in all this book sucks
5,Wes anderson.,Enough said. He is a genius. And this is by far the most acclaimed and my favorite of his movies. Although I love them all equally. Bill Murray.
4,Moving non profit governance on,In this book the authors have taken a fresh look at the conventional wisdom of non profit governance. moving the debate on from the classic boards must govern and mamagement must mange divide. They provide useful insights into a more dynamic and flexible relationship. A good read.There is however need for more guidance on implementing the model.
5,Great service on a great CD.,I am totally enjoying my CD. I also want to say that it was shipped quickly and was wrapped so good that nothing was damaged. I will use this person again.
5,Great Gun,The gun is perfect size for hunting in tight space areas. It is good quality fabrication and great as a secondary gun if you dive with 2 at the same time.
4,Should be required middle school reading!,"A tender, candid, lasting story, the spot-on historical and pop-culture references notwithstanding. The world of confusion, odd insights, hurt and joy at teenage is dizzying, yet marvelously encapsuled in Jason Taylor, who grows before our eyes from a meek follower to a principled young man anybody could wish as a friend. Every single character, no matter how ugly, is beautifully developed, and the unexpectedly straight-forward telling is, to me, David Mitchell's best."
4,Read it!,"I really loved this book. I wish I had read it when I was in junior high. It's a great depiction of the dread associated with being unpopular and picked on during the middle school years, as well as the few bright spots. I also liked that the chapters each read like short stories. My only complaints are that the main character is a bit too poetic/philosophical for me to stomach at times, and the abundant 80's pop culture references seemed gratuitous"
2,Lord of the Flies...not,"Judging by the number of five star reviews, I must have read a different book. I found the vernacular tortuous, the characters jaded, the plot line predictable.... ahh..what else is there to say? I had high expectations for this book and it didn't deliver."
4,Not my favorite,"David Mitchell is one of my favorite contemporary writers, but this is not my favorite book by him. I don't mind the slow pace, it's just that the problems and conflicts the characters face just seem so alien to me."
5,An outstanding book !,"This is an outstanding book in many ways. Character, Plot, Setting, Language, etc.I am not going to be a ""prat"" and give any on it away but if your are a reader I recommend it.A Confederacy of Dunces"
1,Couldn't even finish chapter one,"I gave up reading ""Black Swan Green"" by David Mitchell in the middle of chapter one. Yes, it was that dull. However, the New York Times has a positive review of ""Black Swan Green"". I could find only one negative comment in the entire review: ""Black Swan Green is uneventful, at least in comparison with Mitchell's other books.""Mitchell's previous book, ""Cloud Atlas"", was one of my top 5 picks for 2005. I should go back and read his earlier works."
5,No living without hearing celine!,"Greatcd, this cd is my secound fav by mrs,dion. I listen to my albums of celine everyday... like i said ,""No living without hearing celine."" there would be just no living without hearing celine, oh no!!"
5,This really shows the color of her love for Rene!,"Working her hardest as always, Celine has astounding tracks on the album such as ""The Power Of Love."" Not married yet to Rene, Celine writes love-liner notes, which is no surprise to her future husband Rene Angellil. This is when Celine finds her stylr always by Rene's side. This album can be really emotional for couples falling in love with song called ""When I Fall In Love."" There is a duet with someone but I don't know who. On this album Celine, also as always exspresses herself in a different way."
1,Better than death.,"Although Celine's Album, ""The Colour of My Love"" starts out attractively with the song, ""THe Power of Love,"" it quickly degenerates from there. THe second song, ""Misled"" simply grates. By the time she reaches the finally with ""The Colour of My Love"" I found myself begging for ""Misled"" again. Buy this album at your own risk."
2,Another disappointment release,I give this 2 stars beacause again a track was left off the U.S. release called 'Just Walk Away' it was on the canadian and worldwide releases but why not on the american. I had to buy this disc again when I went to Canada just for that extra track that was left off the U.S disc. If Sony 550 leaves off any more tracks I won't bother wasting my money on their half releases.
1,huh?,"Celine Dion makes music for people too lazy to bother turning the radio dial or to shut off the television. This is really flaky, mindless music.The lyrics are completely inane and she is completely tasteless.Does this woman know the meaning of restraint?? You've got to wonder what the real motives are behind writing such horrendous drivel.I mean is this the best she can come up with? Oops, what am I saying, for the most part, she probably doesn't even write this garbage.Let me tell you something people, if you just use your head and a little imagination,you can find music that is much more rewarding and will make this trite music obsolete.There are bands in this world far superior and deserve to be recognised for there efforts,do yourself and the world a favour,BOYCOTT CELINE DION."
5,Buy It!,"This is one of Celine's best! I have four of Celine's CD's, and I think that this one is my fave. Even though I would give her other CD's 5 stars. Buy this CD if you like Celine."
2,THE POWER OF THE VOICE,"Celine's voice is her trademark to continue her life in this business of music, although she hasn't show talent in the writing music way, is no mistake this canadian girl can sing, Thank God For That!, but Colour Of My Love is a pure example that an amazing voice can't always save medioquer written songs, Celine's third 550 Music album feautures one of the lady most incredible performances: ""The Power Of Love"", this song has been record by many, but Celine made it her own, and is not question that it will be difficult to make another version that surpases this gem. Sadly this precious tune is surrounded by filler ballads, lame upbeat tracks, and unsensitive creativitiless music. The only kind-of-ok songs after the superb leading single are, the upbeat ""Mislead"", and the misty ""Think Twice""."
2,Way below my expectations...,"Céline did not do well with this album. Nearly all of its songs are bland and nonemotional. They have no energy or feeling to them. The only good songs on this album are ""The Power Of Love"", ""Misled"", and ""When I Fall In Love"". The album is definitely not worth buying unless you are obsessed with Céline, as I am."
1,Celine: The Next Vanilla Ice?,"Although she may seem big now, I predict that in only a few short years, Celine Dion will be mentioned in the same spirit as NKOTB, Marky Mark, and Milli Vanilli: in short, with scorn. This is because her voice, while beautiful at first, quickly grows annoying, and her songs soon degenerate into sugar-coated crap that makes you vomit."
1,disappointed,i was so so sad that this album turns out this way! it doesn't sound nice to me at all! i grew sick of her love ballads
1,sedated,"i got sedated because of this album, not because its so great buy because i was so into my thoughts of what the hell is celine doing, her worst i have seen and the best not yet at all, her songs r real terrible and all her hits r considered trash to me!"
5,no living without listening to celine,"This album really shows the colour of her love for Rene, this album is beautiful. I love all the songs, except I don't listen to the song ""When I Fall In Love"" very much.. I guess cos it's not very moving song. Some of the fast upbeat songs are everybodys talking my baby down, misled, lovin proof, real emotion and no living without loving you. My favorite song on this CD is the power of love, celine shows how strong her vocals really are at this song. I love it!! Fantastic work Celine! So if you think this album isnt good, then ur wrong, just buy it, you won't regret it!! I promise you."
2,Tight across toe area,These shoes are cute but they hurt my feet o bad that I couldn't walk in them at all. They were wide enough but really tight across the toe bed.
2,"Some insights, faulty philosophy","Ruthven's book on torture has some valuable insights. For example, Ruthven discloses that Jeremy Bentham defended torture in some circumstances. Bentham is sometimes given undeserved credit as a progressive force in Anglo-American jurisprudence, and it is good to see him taken down a peg here.Still, Ruthven has his own blinders. He seems to be a Marxist of a sort. He presumes, then, that torture should be understood as a desperate effort by a ruling class to perpetuate its rule. When he deals with torture in the Soviet Union, he cannot bring himself to acknowledge that this was conducted by committed Marxists -- so he claims that it was really the remnant of pre-revolutionary superstitions that caused all the trouble. If they had been real Marxists, of course, they would all have been nice!That variety of special pleading weakens the book throughout."
1,India : Facing the Twenty-First Century (The Essential Asia),"The worst book ever written on India. If you already knew something about India, you'd see Crossette hadn't a clue what she was talking about. If you knew nothing about India, you'd learn nothing about it by reading her book, either. A gem from this book: Indians don't play American football, tennis or baseball, so they do not like sports. No, I am not making this up. Apparently, she has not heard of the cricket fanaticism in India. -by Philip Oldenberg, professor at UC Berkeley"
2,What were they thinking?,"OK.....with all the EXCELLENT Flash 5 books out there, why on EARTH did I buy this one? Perhaps cause it had MACROMEDIA on it, and since they invented Flash, I would expect something better. The exercises weren't even COMPLETE!! and after doing them, I found a better way to do it. Stick with the better authors.....COLIN MOOCK for one, Branden Hall, Sham Banghal, or The Friends of ED......this is truly a LEMON!!"
5,What incomplete lessons?,"I bought this book based on the recommendation of a friend at school. I have never used Flash before, so I figured that this would be a good book to start with. I'm glad I got it. I can't find those incomplete lessons that the other reviews have talked about. Everything worked just fine, and I learned a lot about Flash.I e-mailed the author to thank her, and she told me that the real thanks for the book belongs to the people she mentioned in her thank-yous. This book appears to be designed to give a little taste of a lot of different aspects of Flash, and it did an excellent job of doing just that. I don't think it's intended for someone who has been using Flash for a while, so if you're already an expert, I'd recommend looking at some of the more advanced books. This one's for us beginners :)"
5,great introduction to flash,"I'm new to Flash, and this book did a great job at taking me through all of the pieces of building an entire Flash site. The instructions were very easy to follow, and the author was more than happy to answer additional questions that I had. If you're new to Flash, this is the book to get. It certainly helped me get started!"
4,Great tutorial,After trying and returning a couple of other Flash books I bought the Training from the Source book and loved it right from the start. I do have a problem in lesson three and am looking for an eratta on the book if there is one. I found one typo so far that makes lesson 2 look funny. (Pg 58 #7 the Height and Width are reversed.)In lesson 3 I can't find the Neptune Logo Symbol in the common library.
1,Information Delivered with Arrogance,"This book has many typos and incorrect descriptions. It's disheartening to see such a half...attempt at writing. Especially, one that has the Macromedia logo on it. They have the right idea, but they need a MORE QUALIFIED AUTHOR."
2,I Second MacCruciating,"Saturday is a tour de force redoing of Mrs. Dalloway as a male neurosurgeon. Perhaps the made-for-tv-movie aspects--such as the Cosby Show family (including Famous Poet But Alcoholic father-in-law; Brilliant, Beautiful Attorney wife; Just-Ripe Poetess daughter; and So-Cool, Handsome Guitarist son) and the climax--are meant to be ironic (and certainly that is achieved in a reader's recipe, suitable for a glossy lifestyle magazine, for the fictional fish stew), but they come across as simply enervated. Even with its flourishes, the novel is too clever by half: The research pages about neurology and music audibly turn. I hope that Ian McEwan can find a better way to use his facility. Saturday is a real let-down after Atonement."
3,Promising start...,"I greatly enjoyed the first two thirds of McEwan's latest novel, having loved ""Atonement"" but being left unmoved by his other efforts. The ending, however, seemed a trifle overworked, and I may have missed something - but I could not work out how the fateful rendezvous could take place... Still, my attention was wandering, I admit. He is a fine manipulator of language and the characters are fully drawn and believable... But I ended up less impressed than I started."
2,"slow, cumbersome to finish","I realized that you will either love this book or hate it. Personally I found his narrative slow. There is no real plot or structure to this novel. It merely drags on and on with verbose descriptions. This is like reading a personal blog. The author does a wonderful job at dressing up an ordinary Saturday afternoon, going into depth about his mundane reflections. If you want to be put to sleep, then I highly recommend this book."
2,Saturday,"Rather poor... Characters are quite unrealistic. Style reminded me Daniel Steel's in some parts, who i can not stand... I did not find anything thought provoking. Mentioning 9/11 and chechens is just not enough for a good book."
3,Not for me the best of McEwan!,"I have read his books earlier with great interest and speed. This book, to me, was not among his best, though I like his way of telling the stories. For Mc Ewan fans? Maybe."
5,A great novel!,Ian McEwan is a master storyteller. Excellent and very thought provoking! A must read for all of us in the post-9/11 world.
1,Overrated and tedious,"I listened to the audio version of this book while commuting. The book is a disaster from the start.The writing is tedious, the characters are laughably artificial. The writer fills a lot of pages with dreary descriptions of neurosurgery. I thought this obsession with medical details was an affliction mainly among younger American writers but it seems Ian McEvan is proof the epidemic has spread. It doesn't help that the audio version of the book is narrated by somebody with the most insufferable and effeminate british accent I have encountered."
2,Pompous Drivel,"If you want to learn, in detail, how to perform neurosurgical procedures, and if your idea of a good book is endless character history and exposition with hardly any plot, or if you are an ersatz intellectual, then this book is for you.Someone should teach Mr. McEwan this basic edict of writing: Show, don't tell.Don't waste your time. Look elsewhere."
2,much ado about nothing,"""Saturday"" reminded me of the film, ""my dinner with Andre,"" wherein two people spend a couple of hours over dinner just rambling on about life and living a la stream of consciousness ad nauseum. The endless descriptions of performing brain surgery [w/ all the big words] and 18 pages decribing a soccer match sounded, frankly, a little self-indulgent. I didn't care, and not being a brain surgeon myself, would prefer to leave the anatomy lectures to med students. I found myself just skimming page after page looking for some unity. Instead, I found the same heavy-handed psychological terrain couched as a novel. I thought that the metaphor of the burning plane to be an interesting element until it just faded into the blur of everything else. Yes, McEwan is a solid writer, offering interesting perceptions through his main character, but ""Saturday"" reads more like an autobiography."
2,Could not get past 100 pages,"I was interested to read this book, however I could not make it through the first 100 pages. The book is simply one man's thoughts and recounting of the events of one day. I found it very mind-numbing to simply follow one person's train of thought throughout his day. It was very anti-climatic, although the reader can sense that the author is building and building and building onto something.... However, I did not have the patience to find out what that 'something' was. I also work with neurosurgeons and I can assure you that none of them act like that and the description of his work was unrealistic. In reading other reviews it sounds that if I stuck with the book, it may have been slightly more interesting. However, I instead found it incredibly boring. I feel that life is too short to stick with a book that doesn't grab my interest at least halfway through!!"
2,Surprised by how little I like this book,"I am up to page 100 and am surprised by how annoyed and bored I am by this book. The surgeon's endless musings about life and the world are choking the story out of this novel. I just graduated from Nursing school and find the medical end of the story almost a little goofy...I guess Mcewan watched a few procedures and decided to throw a mention of every single one of them into the mix...and he doesn't even make them interesting! The constant name dropping about favorite music, writers, etc. is grating. I'm disappointed. I loved Atonement and am not quite sure this will be worth finishing."
1,Insufferably boring,"Saturday is one of the most tedious novels I've had the misfortune to read in years. I loved the first half of McEwan's Atonement, though I felt the second half was ruined by too many repetitive war and hospital scenes, and a subtle shift in narrative that struck me as forced. Saturday, however, is composed of nothing but pointless detail (if you like descriptions of a man going to the bathroom, flushing, and choosing socks, this is the book for you) and conflict that leads nowhere and results in nothing. I'm so glad I read the terrible reviews of this book on Amazon and saved myself the chore of reading the last third. I skipped straight to the last page and felt I'd got the gist of it, which is essentially a lot of pretentious navel-gazing. What a disappointment."
1,do yourself a favor: sleep in on Saturday and skip this book,"Turgid and plodding. A godawful waste of time. Possibly the most boring piece of crap ever written. And they say this guy (McEwan)is the second coming of Saul Bellow? If that's the case, remind me not to read any of Bellow's books either."
2,Overrated,I decided to give Mr. McEwan a try in reading one of his novels. I did not want to read ATONEMENT because quite frankly that story sounds boring. This book grabbed from a recommended table. It had a good plot but the author really did not develop the story to the point where I actually knew what was going to happen before it happened. Also he spent a lot of time on tangents in the characters minds and they really took away from what he was trying to convey in this story. Rent it from the library and save your $12.
5,A man's head,"To spend a day in a man's head, and have those thoughts be written by McEwan. Mesmerizing."
4,Rivals Roth in timely execution,"Reading this reminded me of ""The Human Stain,"" Philip Roth's near contemporaneous novel using the Lewinsky scandal as a backdrop. McEwan's one day in the life of a neurosurgeon is wonderfully rendered, asks the right questions without becoming a tract or screed, and shows what it feels like to live right now. It also serves as an instructive lesson in the folly of various pre-war predictions of dire consequences that turned out to not have materialized.My only gripe would be that for McEwan, this book is 50-100 pages too long. I only say that because I remain in awe of how compact, lean, and spartan his style is, and how elegant."
2,Boring,"I found that because I intensely disliked Henry Perowne the narrator, the book was painful to read. I really was hoping that Baxter was going to lay a beating on him. Henry reminds me a several Englishmen that I know. They are so self-involved and believe that the world revolves around them. This novel was such a disappointment. I really liked Atonement and looked forward to Ian's next work. I have read the other reviews. I am sorry but to me Henry is boring and thus this novel was boring"
2,"It's not ""Atonement""","I really like McEwan but was disappointed. I thought the novel was ""over-engineered"" and sounded forced. McEwan couldn't make me really care about Perowne. Instead of being introspective, he sounded just like a whiner to me. Sorry, but not as gripping as ""Atonement"" or even ""Amsterdam"". Nice idea... a whole story of one day. However, Joyce Carol Oates did a MUCH better job, IMHO, with ""What I Lived For"" which took place over a weekend. That novel moved!Overall, I was much more taken with Cormac McCarthy's latest.....""No Country for Old Men."" It was extremely introspective from the view of the old sheriff but it was EXCITING! A real page turner. ""Saturday"" can't stand up in comparison."
2,disappointing,"There is no way this book is ""brilliant"" or a ""substantial piece of literature,"" which is what the reviews said. I agree with other reviewers about their total lack of care about any of the characters. This book was boring and the story was unbelievable. The author's other book, Atonement, is much better."
4,"Not McEwan's best, but his writing skill redeems it","In ""Saturday"" McEwan does his traditionally excellent job of building cinematic suspense, although not to the standard set by ""Atonement.""Like ""Enduring Love,"" which it most resembles, it relies too much on steering a conventional life into a shockingly violent turn. (At least it wasn't quite as predictable as, say, Flannery O'Connor.)And yet, McEwan's eye for detail seems to get better and better. (Sarcasm about his research methodology deleted). The neurosurgery scenes, the squash game, the fish seller are all described adeptly and efficiently.Overall, very enjoyable. I was particularly fond of the parallels with ""Ulysses""; I suppose there's a good college English paper, and several bad ones, to be written on that subject."
1,Highly Overrated,"All I can say is how disappointed I was in this book. It was given RAVE reviews by critics as well as other avid readers, but it was all I could do to make myself finish it. The books starts off alright, but the author's tendency to ramble and go off on an entirely obscure tangent made me want to throw the book. I found myself re-reading lines over many times to try to find out what the author was getting at, or what point he was trying to make by discussing such strange things in the middle of a different thought. I was very confused a majority of the time and the times I wasn't I was just plain bored. Not recommended for even huge fans of Ian McEwan."
2,Unlikely and unlikeable,"Although well written, I found it hard to keep going with this book. There are numerous long descriptive sections (for example, pages and pages were taken up in describing a squash game) in which I lost interest. The high level of introspection was somewhat unconvincing. And the characters, apart from Baxter and Grammaticus, were dull and complacent. I found Perowne's children particularly unlikely and unlikeable.I was interested to read that the central character, Perowne, preferred William James to his ""fussy brother"" Henry, because the latter would ""run round a thing a dozen different ways than call it by its name"". This was much the way I found this book. Good editing could perhaps reduce it to a short story of some merit, but as a full length novel, it is weak."
1,Profiting from Others' Distress,"Having enjoyed Atonement, I looked forward to reading Saturday, expecting an interesting and compelling narrative. I was very quickly disabused of this idea when I realized that Mr. McEwan had decided to use Huntington's Disease (HD) as a literary device to tell a story about a self-interested physician who is forced in the course of a single day to reevaluate the important things in life. Because the symptoms of HD are described in the novel by a brain surgeon, who is assumed to be an authority on the disease, readers who have no experience with HD may be led to believe that Mr. McEwan's stereotype is invariably true: that people with HD are violent and dangerous. Coping with a hereditary and totally debilitating disease is more than enough by itself. To make readers think they should fear such people's behavior is both cruel and a great injustice."
2,"wow, what a disappointment","I loved ""Atonement"" for its subtle, deep and expansive writing. I hated Saturday for the opposite take.(I also enjoyed ""Amsterdam"" a lot) This book is a great disappointment since McEwan is obviously very talented, and I expected more than just a pot boiler with every cliched character the author could find....the ""artiste"" son and daughter to offset the ""driven"" mom and dad, the alzheimer ridden grandma, the cranky grandpa, the brutish criminal who suddenly is transformed into a sensitive soul by a poetry reading, the obligatory nude scene and finally the constant references to the ""dangerous world"" we live in because of the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11.Please give us more credit than that to fill your pages, Mr. McEwan."
1,"Atonement it is not, Disappointment is more like it","What a sad use of a decent writer's talent. Boring self-obsessed character who spends more time describing his squash game(9 pages)than love making with his wife (less than one). Besides being a conservative butthead, he never makes us believe that he is going to learn to be anything other than way too self-involved. The entire final plotting of book is contrived nonsense that belongs more on General Hospital than in literary fiction. I want the hours back I wasted hoping for this one to redeem itself."
1,Emperor's clothes,"After having read Atonement and Amsterdam this was such a disappointment. It is verbal diarrhoea. It is a case of ""look how many big words I can use and I have digested the medical dictionary aren't I a clever person."" The story line is mediocre and it is unbelievable that this even got even close to the Booker prize. It is in a league with Tracy Emin's unmade bed. The emperor has no clothes."
2,No thumbs up for Saturday,The book is exquisitely written but has no plausible story line. It's a pity that such a talent for writing cannot come up with a more interesting and realistic plot.
2,"plodding, over written","I got this book out of the library as an introduction to McEwan with high expectations as Mr McEwan enjoys a good reputation.I gave up on it. It's a plodding character study in which to little happens over too long. I found his writing style interesting at first, bout eventually was wondering whether he would ever get on with the job of telling a story and stop the endless internal monologues. He didn't. I couldn't wait around any more. The book goes back to the library today.After reading some reviews I might try Atonement instead."
2,What a let down!,"Anxiously awaited this book. What a disappointment. How can a guy who wrote Amsterdam, Enduring Love and Atonement produce such tedium?"
2,Dull,It's well written but the only way I got through this book was skimming. The first 150 pages are slow and boring and pointless. Certain events are interesting but then it gets boring again.
1,Shell Game,"Ian McEwan manipulates words, creates a protagonist with a less than run-of-the-mill job, and takes us as readers into that man's work and private world. He introduces us to assorted haves and have-nots who behave more or less the way we would expect them to behave. Nobody is very interesting, least of all the hero. McEwan seems to be saying, ""Look what I can do!"" or ""Catch me if you can!"" I do not know what the critics see in this author. To me, it's another instance of the Emperor's New Clothes. I wanted to care for somebody--anybody--in this book. I came closest to feeling that for the drunken grandfather who wrote poety but, finally, he, too, is just another cliché"
3,Way tooo detailed,"Because it all happens over one day, every single action is scrutinized and drawn-out, almost to the point of beating a dead horse. So the protagonist will say something and we won't read the response until the next page--this is how it doesn't keep you reading for more. You get impatient and then give up. Also, McEwan tries to impress us with fancy neurosurgery language, which just gets skiimmed over and confuses you."
3,Deeply engrossing and chilling,"With Perwone he depicts an accurate portrayl of an upper class surgeon in contempory England. As a retired surgeon, I find his ability to capture the cognitive process of a neurosurgeon amazing for a layman. He brings chills to mind as past decisions are remembered. Slow to develop, but stunning in abruptness of the climax and resolution. A superb novel with balanced political perspectives. Will linger in your mind for some time."
5,Quibble,"I loved this book and found it deeply affecting and, in a sense, life-changing, like other Ian McEwan novels. But I have one unexpected quibble near the end of the novel: I just don't believe that Henry Perowne -- a thoughtful and cultured man, who, after all, listens knowledgeably to Bach; who buys rare orchids for his mother; and who can offer us an interesting and subtle imagining of an Edwardian doctor who would perhaps soon be losing sons to WWI -- I just don't believe that Perowne would fail to recognize ""Dover Beach"" when he hears his daughter recite it. A minor, but nonetheless annoying, flaw in the plot. Does anyone agree?"
3,Pretentious,"No doubt that this is a very creative book but it is just so overdone and long winded. Whereas other Brit writers that I love (Nick Hornby, Steve Horsfall) get straight to the point, Mr McEwan takes 5 pages when 1 would suffice. Maybe it's a matter of style but I got a bit bored"
1,WHERE WAS HIS EDITOR...PROBABLY ASLEEP FROM READING THIS BOOK,"This story would probably have been more at home in a book of short stories......if the author had had the good sense to cut his 289 pages of ramblings down to about 60 pages. I do appreciate descriptive writing, but this is ridiculous. A reviewer in the Los Angeles Times said to ""Read the last 100 pages at one sitting - - the pace and thrill allow it"". What they failed to say was that the first 189 pages will have put you to sleep and you will be well rested to take on the last 100.I much prefered his book Amsterdam. It actually had a story worth reading."
4,"Lyrical, Meditative Novel","Saturday chronicles one eventful day in the life of a London neurosurgeon. The book does not have a plot in the traditional sense, but allows its themes and events to slowly develop and merge into a complete picture.McEwan sets the book on the day of the main anti-war riots in 2003. This creates a backdrop of uncertainty and violence, which slowly builds to a climactic confrontation in the doctor's home in the evening. He and his daughter represent different ways of responding to violence, both in their own actions and in their political views. At the end, both have changed and developed as a result of a crime.The book has some elements which strain credibility, but all in all it offers a fine portrait of its main character, who becomes the quintessential modern man. McEwan's prose is a particular delight, as it flows in sinuous sentences and beautifully turned phrases. Well worth the read, especially for fans of serious contemporary fiction."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this novel the day it was released because I had SO loved the author's previous work, ATONEMENT. Unfortunately, this book was a total diappointment. Though the beginning is promising, the plot is SO contrived and unlikely that I felt cheated at the end.This one went to the used book store as soon as I finished it."
2,Not McEwan's Best - Read 'Atonement' instead,"I heard so much about this book...probably because it was connected with 9/11. I was very disappointed with Saturday.Unlike ""Atonement,"" the only other McEwan book I read (which I loved), I did not get involved with the characters of Saturday. It was as if McEwan was trying to get into the mind of his main character here - dissect the internal dialogue, but unlike John Updike and his Rabbit Angstrom character, it did not work in Saturday for McEwan. I felt ""blah"" the entire book. I read it and forgot about it. It won't move you like ""Atonement"" will.It isn't a bad book, but it isn't a great one either. It's just a book."
2,tedious to read,"This book had some interesting plot twists, and certainly the author is talented and has a very literary (if not pompous) style that results in some beautiful passages. But the book was extremely tedious...every little detail expressed in excruciating detail, Henry's every thought examined from 12 different directions. My favorite -- a squash match that has no bearing on the plot, and takes 15 pages to describe. Do you need to know any more?"
1,"Thick, thick, thick","I am an avid reader and I am familiar with this author, but this was almost an impossible book to read. The only reason I finished it is because our book club chose it. It was ""24"" in print form, only the subject was a rather neutral character whose occupation as a neurosurgeon and thoughts about that subject would leave most of us out in the cold. Some relevant and metaphorical themes presented themselves regarding violence, protest, crime, and the current US involvement in Iraq. Otherwise, I've never been so glad to leave a book behind."
2,Imagine 300 page book about 1 single saturday in your own life.,"That about sums it up. Vaguely interesting in places, completely unbelievable in others. Mostly boring."
1,Professional Hype,"Unfortunately, a few professional reviewers in this so far limited reviewed book have inflated, grosssly, the the inherent value of the book. If you like the above sentence structure, you'll like ""Saturday"". If you have a surving numerical IQ , you will recognize this book for what it is ... a total waste of time.Any book that covers 24 hours and takes more to read is wasting your time. I won't enumerate the paasages of this book that surpass trivial. This was at best a weak short story.I have read twenty one books this year, fiction and nonfiction. This one comes in at number 21. If Neal Stephenson had waited to release ""The System of the World"" in 2005, it might have moved up one.Please don't waste your time on this poorly conceived and even more poorly executed book."
4,Less Talented Work from a Tremendous Talent,"Putting aside the ending--which reviewers have justifiably cited as too neat--McEwan's novel offers what we'd expect from such a talented writer--brilliantly drawn characters, a compelling plot, and illuminated (if sometimes indulgent) prose. Henry Perowne's meditations on Iraq, his mother, his profession, his marriage and family are expertly interwoven, each rubbing against the other in a tight rope that, in any other writer, might be a tour de force. However, this is the author of Atonement, and a reader is bound to ask, ""Is this McEwan's most compelling work?"" I wish I could say yes, but I suspect the same touch of lethargy that afflicts Henry in this novel, one that arises from comfort and awaits something unsettling to spur him in motion again. McEwan's stories always seem to arise from writing assignments he gives himself. That has never bothered me before now. As accomplished as Saturday is, McEwan's assignment here seems a little more transparent."
2,Rent must have been due.....................,"After reading Atonement, I couldn't wait to sit down with Mr. McEwan's newest book. This book from start to finish reads like someone resting on their laurels. The book has very little plot, and what little that there is, does not ring true. Most often this book seems like a platform for Mr. McEwan to opine on the War in Iraq and also to give his thoughts on humanity in general--oh the human race is cruel--that's original. Atonement could be slow, but was always worth reading on, this book took everything I had not to just put it down. I hope this isn't an indication of things to come from this author."
1,Let me cut to the chase!,"If you're expecting this book to develop into a story, forget it. At many points in the book (pg 30,50 90 150 200 etc.) I thought something would happen to peak my interest. It remains boring, highly unbelievable and has an absurd ""twist"" in the very late chapters. As a surgeon, I was little impressed with his medical terms and descriptions of operations. It is just DULL. Save your time and money."
1,Very disappointing,"Reviews seemed fabulous. The first 75 pages or so were entertaining enough.Then the book dragged, digressed and rambled along. I forced to continuereading very slowly. Finally in the last 60 - 70 pages the book picks upbut it is pointless. A pure waste of time."
1,A great disappointment,"I started this novel with much anticipation based on all the fabulous reviews. Unfortunately it was an utter waste of time. McEwan can write but by the end I was hoping for the happy ending of the whole family's demise--maybe that was McEwan's goal. I so despised them all. I also thought McEwan and by proxy the main character were terrible misogynists. The main character's thought process while his daughter faces rape right in front of his eyes was disgusting, as was the same character's response to the major crisis at the end. He is only concerned with his own messiah complex. This was a thoroughly un-enjoyable and despicable work. If I could give it a zero I would, the whole thing left me incredibly angry at why anyone could enjoy this as great literature."
4,McEwan writes what we all think.,"Post 9/11 our thinking has changed and no one has written about the paranoia, fears, or anxiety that we all unconsciously deal with on a day to day basis. A few short sentences here and there and McEwan touches on unspoken feelings we all have...about that day and about the future. A bit too detailed in some places, I found myself skipping ahead. BUT I always got a grip because I didn't want to miss a single word. Yes, I believe McEwan is and will be one of the greatest writers of this generation."
2,Sadly this book's rather dull,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Ian McEwan and was eagerly awaiting his new release - but sadly this book is not one of his better ones.Perhaps it was the uncharacteristic sentimentality, or the too perfect family cast (ie brilliant neurosurgeon, brilliant lawyer, brilliant jazz musician, brilliant poet etc - there has to be a failure in there somewhere?), or the thin characterisation of the bad guy (a Martin Amis gangster without the humour), or the rather weird and tentative political commentary, or is it simply that spending a day in the mind of a serious middle-aged doctor is really not particularly interesting?No doubt prime Booker prize material"
3,"skillful, but disappointing","He is a master of style & this book is no exception, but the plot & flow is not worthy of his beautiful prose. I would not pass on this book, but would encourage Mr. McEwan not to be so lazy in the plot department!"
4,All In A Day's Work,"I won't go into much detail because most of the other reviewers have told you all about Saturday, February 23, 2003. A surgeon, who loves to listen to classical music while he operates. How seranading. A surgeon who has a wife with a superior IQ. A surgeon with a poetic daughter and a music lover son. How quaint. What a perfect family----so you think. All hell breaks loose for this surgeon by the things that he encounters all in one day. It felt like the earth stood still and swallowed him up for that one day.Also recommend Lust Of The Flesh by Beverly Rolyat. A different read that appeals to both black & white audiences. From who done it to lust to betrayal, murder, suspense, sizzling sexy scenes, romance and surprising twists and turns are only the beginning of this exciting, pageturning, edge-of-seat novel. Happy reading."
2,Very disappointing,"I had really high hopes for this book that were totally disappointed. The plot points were obvious, the writing was dull, the day dragged on forever. It would take some serious convincing or extreme prolonged boredom to get me to pick up a McEwan book again."
2,"Beautiful writing, glacial pace","This book suffers from the same affliction as ATONEMENT: beautiful, textured prose with no sense of how a story should be paced and told. I tried very hard to like this book, but the self-absorbed stream of conscious of the narrator repeatedly gets in the way of moving the plot along. I found myself thinking, over and over, ""For God's sake, man, get on with it!"" Wasting ten pages on a meaningless game of squash - and I used to be a tournament-level player - does nothing to advance the plot. Nor does his painfully long-winded description of making a fish stew (I can buy a Julia Child book or CD for something like this). McEwan is unable to keep from wrapping the story around the axle in paragraph after paragraph of boring detail, much of which seems designed to simply show off his writing skills, which are considerable. Finishing this book was a real chore. I do not recommend it, and I'm surprised that it was short-listed for the Booker Prize."
3,So far so irritating,"I am currently half way through the second mammoth chapter of this book and am finding it hard going - mainly because the author's ignorant, showy, and trite characterisations of scientific theories (from Evolution to Quantum Physics) make me want to punch him. Still - maybe it's Perowne's takes on science that are ignorant, arrogant, and trite, rather than McEwan's.I suppose I ought to perservere..."
2,a bit boring,"This story occurs over one day (Saturday, as in the title). Beautifully written but it is inevitably boring as it takes a full book to narrate the events of a single day. A lot goes through the main character's mind and this seems to be the main focus of the book. Didn't like it..."
1,"""Saturday"" COULD Have Been a Short Story!","The most meaningful activity in this book took place in two chapters. The rest of the book dragged on and on, and contained a lot of superfluous information that I felt did not really contribute to the story!"
2,beautifully written and silly,"Mcewan is a fine prose stylist, but this novel is a failure in every other way. The characters are either languidly or hyperbolically unreal. The dramatic elements of the plot are absurd, mannered, and astonishingly unconvincing. The meditations on world events-- the war in Iraq, 911, etc-- are tepid and obvious.Why has this book gotten so much acclaim?"
2,Hype Only,"A complete waste of time. McEwan has done much better -- ""Atonement,"" for example. The characterizations were thin and the story simply boring and predictable with enough sidetracks to make another not very interesting book. It was difficult to finish. I felt like stopping numerous times but kept thinking it might get better or ""pay off"" in some way -- it doesn't. There are too many better books to waste time on this one."
3,Underwhelmed,"This is easily the most overhyped book of the year. Yes, it is incredibly well-written, with a love for language and emotional truths that shine brightly, but the book is also deadened by the unbelievable self-awareness of the narrator, who creates so much foreboding and foreshadowing as to rob the story of much of its surprise. Speaking of which--some of the events and final revelatons feel forced together to serve the narrative tool of taking place in a 24-hour day. A little less would have meant much more."
2,High hopes... but big disappointment,"I was very much expecting to be engaged and passionate about this book, which came highly recommended by a few people in my circle. In fact, the complete opposite happened.There were moments that this book was brilliant, and times it was a complete bore. The writing style is ok at best with too much on the minutia. I know the auther speaks of other authors and says that the genius is in the minutia (specific to Jane Austin), but I guess it was lost on me.I actually think the movie could be a great screenplay after it is reworked a bit. There are some great characters in the book that just don't get explored enough. Overall, I can't say I'm a big fan."
2,"Neither liked nor cared about these characters, reading was druggery",I'm not going to waste another precious minute on this book. My opinion is in the heading.
2,Felt more like a rainy Sunday,"Unfortunately this novel didn't do anything for me at all. I am only giving it two stars as I do feel McEwan has talent in writing some fine prose, but the story line in this novel was more like a Rube Goldberg device. One action causes another action blah blah blah.Not sure what the intent of the novel was by IM, but I feel that this novel was written in a hurry without much though given to the overall theme of the book. A doctor with a conscience and great wife with two smart kids - come on - I cannot believe I finished it and I only did because in the end I needed something to put me to sleep. Sorry IM, but this wasn't the best job."
4,A nice read,"Whether or not this novel really qualifies as high literature might be up for debate, but ultimately it does read rather well.Basically the story of one day in the life of a doctor struggling to understand his children, keep ties with his wife, and ultimately come to terms with a wrong committed against him.There are some nice moments suggested through Perowne's realizations of his aging, his love for his wife, and his sincere desires to understand and come to terms with his children.One of the better ironies of the novel is that Perowne doesn't understand the attract of literature, yet lives his life in the midst of people who do, and continually tries to make peace with his failure to get lit.There are some dead end plots (especially the potential terrorists of the first chapter), and the final show down is a bit of a let down, but ultimately this book is a nice way to spend a week end for someone who needs a break from Proust, Joyce, and all those other high literature people."
2,CHECK OUT THE OLD MAN,"A talent, but no match for his father, Tim Buckley, who simply has to be heard to be believed."
5,Penetrating and impeccable.,"This is a penetrating and impeccable book, and it's a shame that it's out of print. The author's comments above are a start at the necessary postscript addressing the controversies of the last ten years; it remains, however, a gift of rare integrity and objectivity from personal experience."
2,Another arm chair psychoanalytic viewpoint expressed,"The author seemed to be analyzing the subject matter from a seemingly armchair analytic point of view rather than allowing the reader to explore the odd behavior of these spiritual individuals and come to our own conclusions. I would have preferred not to have the author pose his hypothesis as to why these individuals do what they do in that who is he to judge such ""crazy behavior"" if he himself is not ""Enlightened""!"
5,Great Resource when in Munich,"Recently bought this before spending 4 days in Munich and, while the newest edition is a few years old now, all of the info concerning the places we visited was accurate. This was my 4th time to Munich and the book led me to go to a couple of wonderful places that would not have been considered otherwise. I even used the transit information to help navigate while visiting other spots in greater Munich."
2,Wrong information in this book!,"If you're going to buy this book, be prepared to do extra research once you're in Munich. You'll need to call the places recommended in this book to see if they're actually open. We wasted two hours of our time in Munich going to a place recommended in the book only to find it closed! Rick Steves has much better info and is reliable!"
5,The only guide you need to Munich!!,This book came in handy when I was in Munich a few years back (I have an older edition). The rating of the beers are pretty accurate. I loved the fact it gave directions on how to get to each place. It's especially nice for those of us who don't speak German. This book is a definate must have for beer drinking travelers. :)
5,Kutless does it again!,"This is a great album and one of the things that makes it great is how they can go from rock to soft. I really like that about Kutless. Although I like the rock better I still enjoy listening to the slower songs quite often like ""Smile"" or ""Promise Of A Lifetime"". I also really enjoyed ""Legacy"" which is the last song on the album it has a great message about how people will remember you when your gone. It's probably my favorite on this album next to ""Somewhere In the Sky"" both these songs feature great guitar solos. One thing to warn you about if your going to listen to the album a lot is that about two songs start off the same but about twenty seconds into them they change. That being said this is an awesome album that has a a lot of great lyrics and messages.This album definitely won't disappoint.And I know that you'll love it."
5,Awesome-the lyrics capture you!,"I am what you call eclectic, I like and dislike everything. This album captures you and really makes you think. They are so different from the 'normal' Christian music that most non-christians (and a lot of Christians) can't stand. It is awesome to see different ways of worship being published! Thanks for your creativity!"
3,Rockin,This is a good christian Rock album. the musicianship in my opinion rivals most of the Secular rock music that is being produced today. It is good rock music to play and not have to worry about the lyrical content.
4,Love it,"I have just discovered Kutless in the last six months after coming across their first CD at a CD Warehouse. I was an instant fan. Hearts of the Innocent is a wonderful CD. Unfortunately, two of the songs here just don't do it for me: Winds of Change and Somewhere in the Sky.It is hard to say which song I love the most though. Smile is great; Changing World is wonderful; Beyond the Surface, Mistakes & Legacy contain excellent messages.While I agree that Jesus isn't mentioned as much as other CD's, the lessons and messages within these songs are powerful and Christian themed."
2,"Been there, done that","Despite what my 2 star rating of their latest release may imply, I am a big fan of Kutless. However, this cd is nothing special, and really, sounds the same as all their others. There has been absolutely no change or maturity in their musical sound or style. Put all their songs on one playlist, play them randomly, and you can't distinguish what cd each of the songs are off of.Good cd if it's the first Kutless for your collection; disappointing if it's your third or fourth."
4,Good Guitars with a catchy chorus,"It seems that every Kutless album that comes out has more and more slow songs and less of Sumrall's scream. Although the ""heavier"" songs on this album are very good, they don't match their self-titled debut. The slow songs are in the same style as the Strong Tower CD. Overall, the album is probably good, not great. I would rank it as their second best album behind their self-titled. What ever happened to Stu?"
4,Great follow-up CD...,"Kutless has done it again, folks! With only three albums up their sleeve, Kutless was already on every Christian rock lovers playlist, but their fourth album, Hearts of the Innocent, has just improved their chance of becoming the next big thing. Every song is packed with heartfelt lyrics, great vocals and energetic rhythms that speak to the common man and woman about the love of Christ. Some of the best songs are ""Promise of a Lifetime"", ""Changing World"", ""Shut Me Out"", ""Hearts of the Innocent"", and ""Mistakes"". This is a must-have for any devote fan of good, Christian music!!!"
3,"Good sound, falls apart on impact.","While the sound of this harmonica is very, very good, everytime it gets dropped the shell comes apart. Fortunately it clicks back together pretty easily. I guess it's a good thing since it doesn't seem to break, however I was hoping this would have a slightly more durable outer. Can't argue with the sound though, my little boy loves this harmonica."
2,ok,i found the tubes to be very small and easy to lose. i wasn't crazy about the colors. it caked up on my lips and stained them. i do not recommend.
4,#5 Rated Student Cello,A great price for a great student cello. Lightweight case is nice too. So far my 12 year old son is loving it and his musical teacher got a thrill setting it up for him.So far we are very satisfied.
5,Unbelievable!,"If you haven't tried this, you're missing out on a lot. If you have to read fine print or review plans as we do, you'll find this indispensible."
3,"Good bike, but...","Overall, this is a fine bike for my nearly-4 year old. The only problem he has is the left pedal keeps unscrewing and will fall off if I don't tighten it after about 10-15 minutes of riding. I have tightened it with a wrench, but it doesn't help. If not for the pedal problem, I would rate this bike 5 stars."
2,serious problems of credulity,"I made it about 80 pages in before I started to believe that reading this book was actually going to hurt my understanding of the world. It was 80 pages of hyperbolic exaggeration that concern work and studies that in reality have serious problems that may never be solved.I thought it would be good to read as a review of futurists so I wouldn't have to read them to understand their points, but Garreau appears to be a futurist's futurist: the leaning towards fabrication and scenario planning (science fiction writing) is accepted as a baseline, to which he reaches for ever higher flights of fantasy.After the 80 page mark (which ends in the middle of Kurzweil's heaven) this book might start really cooking along, I don't know: it was not my cup of tea. Why base your knowledge of reality on fantasies extrapolated from fantasies?"
1,Less here than meets the eye,"This book is big on eye-grabbing claims and weak on substance. It is designed to appeal to the credulous. The title is one obvious example of the lack of rigor. The book was about ""radical enhancements"" - including the genetic manipulations. It had almost nothing to do with evolution. The author skipped glibbly over that distinction. Readers should be very skeptical about the exaggerations, loose claims, and handwaving in this book."
4,Evolution,"Interesting book, packed with information, but perhaps tries to cover too much information. Also the book leaves out most of the recent research on evolutionary psychology which would have made the predictions a whole lot firmer. (One of the guys he quotes, Lanier, seems to know something about it though.)"
5,Bewildered and Amazed,"I never thought that a book with a naked blue chick would be so AMAZING! This book brought up ideas and facts that are so unique! I love this book, and recommend it to everyone that has an IQ of over 10 ;). I highly recommend it to you, person who is reading my review, and you will be filled with wonder and amazement as I was."
3,Not so radical book on Radical Evolution,"Had to get this book for a class. It was a dreary read but it had plenty of good points in both describing the positive potential of the Singularity and the disastrous scenario if things go downhill. Definitely not the best gift for fans of Thoreau. Not polemical enough, since it tries to show both sides of the argument."
5,Plan Toys are Great!,"I bought this to go with the matching dollhouse. (MY First Dollhouse by Plan Toys) My four-year-old granddaughter just loves these toys. They are well-made, sturdy and very easy to assemble. I was not familiar with this company until I purchased the dollhouse and basement, but would recommend them (Plan Toys) to anyone looking for educational, well-built toys."
3,"Helpful, but not the best.","The book is helpful, in so far as it tells you what each of the shrines have to offer. It will tell you the hours, give you the telephone, address and even tell you if the shrine has a cafeteria and what languages they specialize in. But, it makes no menion of the many places that ARE in this book that DO have relics of the saints. For instance, the National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon has a relic of St. Sharbel and in the book it makes no mention of the relic. One thing that would be helpful to include in the book is the web address of the shrine, as many of these shrines are on the internet. It's a helpful guide book, but not at its best."
2,"Amusing pictures, ridiculous text","For half a century, Colin Wilson has been publishing wildly gullible and sloppily researched books, but he was clever enough to concentrate on themes where there are lots and lots of uncritical buyers -- crime and mysticism.As usual, the text in this collection is unreliable when it is not downright silly.Nevertheless, many of the photographs are interesting to browse through. I had never seen, for example, a photograph of Landru, the French Bluebeard. The photographs are authentic: they do depict the people they claim to depict. You just cannot rely on Wilson's version of what they did.For some reason, this collection has been issued in a variety of titles, sometimes as 'Illustrated True Crime'; sometimes with Damon Wilson listed as co-editor, sometimes not; under different imprints; and with slightly different texts. Since its only value is as a casual and random collection of old photos, that makes no difference."
5,Book review: Science in Ancient Egypt,"Science in Ancient Egypt""Science in Ancient Egypt"" was written by Geraldine Woods. The book is about the sciences they had back then like medicine and irrigation. My favorite part was the mummification because that is how they prepared their dead. It was important because the Egyptians thought that the body had to be preserved so the spirit could live on. A new fact I learned was that the Egyptians were the first to discover medicine and drugs like castor oil. Yes I recommend this book. Who do I recommend it to? Anyone!Aidan M. 6th grade- homeschooled."
5,Great collection!,"I have purchased three of the four volumes from Amazon thus far. My son and I love the collection, especially the artistic style of the Samurai Jack series. I plan on purchasing Season 4 for my son's birthday. All have arrived quickly and undamaged."
5,This is how animation should be done,"Emmy award winning Gendy Tarcovsy does it again. Its not a cartoon, it is art in motion. With a mild storyline, anyone can see that the emphasis here is on the artwork. In my opinion the best season and included is the emmy nominated episode ""birth of evil"". A must have for any fan of the series and anyone who ever saw your childhood cartoons as more than just TV. Amazing."
5,For Coffee Lovers,"I love this coffeemaker. I have made many varieties of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. It is so easy to use and a breeze to clean up any drips. I did buy the separate attachment to use my own coffee. It also works great. I would recommend this to any coffee drinker - whether daily or less. The coffee pods keep the coffee fresh and the many varieties are sure to meet everyone's needs."
2,Don't ignore the negative reviews,I've had this for a month and love having coffee available at my elbow on my desk whenever I want it. BUT It is true that is doesn't make a full cup regardless of setting or kcup size. Also starting to sputter and make weird noises when I first use it in the morning. A couple of times I had to unplug it and wait for it to run water through. Remember it's only a month old.I shouldn't have to tinker with a new product so soon. Buyer be ware!
4,"Very Good, but gets problems quickly","I was really glad to get this. So glad, in fact, that I quickly bought 5 large boxes of K-cups and a carousel to hold them all. It worked perfectly and really well for the first few months, but now, for no reason, has a few really annoying issues. The heating time is the same-very fast, but takes forever to actually dispense, while it used to be immediate. Also, it dispenses the wrong amount. If I choose the regular size, it dispenses the large size and when I hit large, it dispenses large. A few times it didn't even dispense anything at all, and I had to shut it off and on again to get it to work. It's a very good device and the coffee and tea is always amazing and piping hot, but I'm very disappointed that I'm going to have to call customer service already and I've only had it for a month or so."
5,Keurig B40 Elite Review,"Sleek, eclectic, functional - all terms used to describe this gourmet home brewing system. Compact in any kitchen, the ease of its use matches its attractiveness. I love the individual cups used to make single servings. The timer-feature is an added bonus for rushed mornings. Cleaning and maintenance is minimal. I would recommend to anyone looking for a simple, compact brewing system.Marti MelvilleAuthor of ""Deja vu: Farraige""[...]"
5,Awesome! We love it!,"I really wanted this item so my husband got it for me this past Christmas.We use this everyday and love it! It makes the perfect cup of coffee every single time.I won't drink coffee from other brewers, it just doesn't come out right..But with my Keurig I'm always happy! Plus it comes with a variety of choices for each cup (the different K-Cups).I love this and recommend it to all. It's delicious, fast, works great, dependable and doesn't take up a lot of space!"
2,Not good,"Worked for a few days then quit pumping water. Returned to store , saw another upscale model on the clearance rack with a tag that said it had the same problem. Don't know what it was doing on the clearance rack with a defect. Maybe they didn't believe the customer."
3,"not bad, but","two years ago I Bought the keurig for my wife for christmas. she loved it,I held off buying it because i didn't know if it was a fly by fad where you get something and next thing you know you can't get the supplies for it because they stopped making it. As it turned out it went big and now they are everywhere, but within the year the machine started leaking water and sometimes would make only a half a cup before it would turn off. lately it has been hit or miss whether it works or not. So it sits untill I decide whether or not its worth eating all the supplies we collected or dive back in?"
4,I like great coffee,"I purchased the Elite as a gift, and have the more expensive Platinum model at ny home. I have had the opportunity of using this Elite model gift, and like it as much as my more expensive model. Therefore, I recommend purchasing the less expensive Elite and save the approximate $40. Amazon has the best prices I've found on both the coffee makers and the K-cups. The coffees, teas, and hot chocolates are great.On the negative side, the K-cups are expensive and not conveniently available. Major grocery stores in Georgia typically do not sell the K-cups. Amazon sells the K-cups along with a few other retailers including Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohls, Macys and JC Penney."
4,Nice in the office,"I use this coffee machine in my office. It works great for a quick cup of fresh coffee. Easy to maintain. Makes a little more noice than I would like, but its ease of use and lack of mess with coffee grounds makes up for it."
2,"Good coffee, terrible noise","We have had this unit for several years. The convenience is great, and the coffee is good. However, over time the coffee maker has gotten noiser and noiser. It's to the point now, that we can't use it when anyone else is asleep in the house--it make a noise similar to an air compressor. Also you have to keep an eye on it or it will vibrate the cup off the unit and onto the counter. We've tried every way imaginable to muffle it or keep the vibration down, but to no avail. There must be a pump replacement somewhere on the net, but haven't found it yet..."
5,works great!,"I bought this for my fiance for Christmas. It works great and she loves it! It does everything it said it does. It is quick, easy and just a great product. ComplaintKing says...Recommended."
2,Great Machine--Died after 9 months,"Bought the B-40 in October 2010 and loved it. Now in April 2011, it refuses to fill the cup sizes properly. Following ""troubleshooting"" we descaled the machine 2x and still nada. Since we only used filtered water, I did doubt that was the issue. Numerous blogs show that the reliability of these machines are sketchy at best, so now I have a gazillion K-cups and a bum machine :("
1,Don't buy,"Ok, We got this Keurig B-40 for Christmas last year 2009. Couldn't wait to use it. Followed all the directions for the set-up. Worked great for about 2 month's then started to only brew 4 oz. cups of coffee and water without the K-cups. My daughter and I like to have a few big cups of coffee every morning, this was getting frustrating...Called costumer service. 9 months and 3 phone calls later finally got a replacement..... Only to have the replacement do the same thing!! Not sure if there is a one cup coffee maker that actually is easy to use and does what is expected."
1,Do your homework first,"Makes fantastic coffee and ice tea. But....Before you buy do an internet search on all sites. I searched ""Keurig doesn't work"" or ""Keurig doesn't brew"". There is a major problem with the entire line of machines. After several weeks the problem seems to raise its ugly head.Do your home work before you buy."
3,"Good, but buy the B60","I bought a B60 Keurig Coffee Maker a few weeks ago. I liked it so much that I purchased a B40 a few days ago to have in our weekend getaway.While I like it, it's not nearly the coffee maker as the B60. Granted, it lists for about 25% less, but it is much, much noisier, has only two cup sizes and the water amount dispensed for the two sizes is not consistent. The little rascal practically rattles the toaster off the counter. Also, it doesn't come with the large sampler pack, which is about a $10-$14 value in itself.Now, don't get me wrong, you get the same great taste and good temperature and if you truly don't have the extra $$$, buy it. Just don't be surprise is and when you meet a B60 that you wish you'd shelled out the extra $30."
4,Pretty cool but not perfect,"We're using this for a 6-person office. Pros - cleanliness, choice, speed, freshness, practicality; Cons - coffee temperature not quite hot enough to stand up to cold milk, k-cups are not recyclable, several people have complained that the coffee isn't strong enough.We have circumvented several of the ""cons"" by purchasing the reuseable k-filter. This allows us to use our own coffee, brew to preferred strength and not worry about plastic landfill.All in all, a nice machine for the home or small office. For larger offices, the water reservoir is a little too small and I'd also worry about durability since all parts are plastic."
1,HORRIBLE,"Do NOT BUY THIS.They taste like plasticWe bought one here on Amazon. One from Target, Wal Mart and off Best Buy. All them produce plastic tasting coffee."
2,Disappointed,"When this item arrived, the water reservoir had a crack in it. The previous owner had repaired it with tape. This was not disclosed."
2,Great coffee but the environmental cost weighs on my conscious,This thing makes great coffee but after owning one for a few months I sold it on craigslist. The pile of plastic cups you generate after a few weeks of usage is enough to drown someone in a mountain of single-serving guilt. I've gone back to using my old coffee maker.
2,Instant coffee tastes just as good and you can adjust the strength,I was disappointed. It is basically a hotwater maker. Instant coffee tastes better and you can adjust the strength of your coffee. Just get an electric kettle and instant coffee. You will also lower your cost per cup from .40 to about .08 per cup. You will have the additional benifit of being able to make a cup of soup etc...
1,Bad pump,This product works well for a few months and then the water pump starts of fail. It stops pumping water once every 20 or so times and gets worse until you have to through it away after about 6 months. I'm getting another brand.
1,Disappointing,The company does not back their product. I am on my second one and I just shelfed it. It's loud and doesn't make a whole cup of coffee. I will never support this company agian. Very sad.
4,Coffee luxury,"We've had this for one year and have enjoyed using it. It's fast and brews the coffee to a perfect temperature. We use the refillable K-Cups to save money, and by purchasing 2 refillable K-Cups we always have a clean cup ready to use. I bought the same model for my daughter and she had issues with coffee grounds in her coffee. By using the internet she found an easy fix, a fix I hope the company has made in their factory. I would recommend this item with the stipulation that it's purchased with discretionary funds only... it's very expensive. I'm not a coffee purist and I can brew a pot of coffee and enjoy it the next day if I've refrigerated the carafe and then gently nuke the coffee cup. Once this item breaks I doubt I'll replace it."
1,doesn't work,This Keurig Elite was defective. It worked properly for about a week. It then failed to brew a second cup of coffee after brewing a single cup. I called the Keurig Co. and they are to send me a new machine. It's benn a week since the call and still no new machine.
1,nice when it works,Prior to this purchase we bought a Keurig special edition brewer and loved it! We decided to purchase this smaller elite version because we didnt need the larger one in our business. We are very dissapointed with the elite. Sometimes it heats and sometimes it doesnt.
1,BE WARNED: Unreliable,Am on my second B40 and this one is having the same problem as the first one. The water pump fails. It sounds like it's working but it does not move any water. Keurig replaced the first one after three months. Now I'll have to contact them again about the second one. They both made great coffee and tea (hot and iced). Selection of K-Cups is fantastic. I just wouldn't buy this unit again if I had it to do over again.
2,Too weak!,"Sure, when I bought this sucker, everything was hunky dory. Well, except for whenever I would refill the container it would start leaking all over the counter. After about a year of owning it, it tastes like ALL water with a hint of coffee. I've checked all over the Internet to find a way to prevent this, but everyone says the same thing! I've even tried different k-cups in hopes of making a stronger coffee, but it's just not working anymore."
4,Love the drinks; hate the noise,"We got a B40 for Christmas this year. We love the quick drinks; ease of use and such. However, it vibrates alot and makes a loud noise. One cup vibrated right off the machine! We called Keurig on it and they wanted to hear it over the phone (yeah, right). So buy it at a store near you so you can return it if need be."
3,It's fine if you know you need to replace it,"I love my brewer, everything about it, except the fact that it started acting up two days ago, and today it just flat out refused to even power on. I'm getting a new one, the Timothy's Winter Carnival coffee is my favorite in the whole world, and you can't make it without a Keurig. Ihope this next one lasts a while longer, and not less..."
2,Already having issues with it!,"I bought this coffee brewer for my home because we have one at my office and everyone loved it, including me. However, I have only had mine for about four weeks and it is already not working right. Sometimes it only fills the cup with about a half cup of coffee, even though I pressed the large mug button. I have done all the things the ""Trouble Shooting"" tells me to, but it still doesn't work right. Very dissapointed."
5,Great coffee!,"Always hard to get a birthday gift for Mom, and her 88th was no different. Fortunately she stayed with us recently and loved the coffee from our Keurig B-60. So we got her the next smaller one for herself. Avoided the small single cup size as we thought it would be too many steps for her and we got it right - this size is perfect for her! Now she enjoys the same great coffee she had with us. Yes, it does cost a little more per cup, but there is no waste and life is too short to drink bad coffee!"
2,After 1 year -- it stopped working,"First, I love this coffee maker. My wife and I use it to make hot water for loose tea and ramen noodles. We also regularly drink beverages made from the hot chocolate, coffee and tea K cups. I use it just about every day.However, now at just a little over one year, the machine no longer works. When I try to make coffee the machine will emit a low purr until I power cycle. When I try again, it will spit out enough water to make twice the amount required.This is a great device, but don't plan on longevity."
4,K Cups with your own coffee,"The Coffeemaker using the prefilled (very expensive) K cups is very good and simple.I purchased the Coffeemaker because I am the only coffee drinker in the house and single cup stood out and sold me. I knew you could use your own coffee (money saver) with the purchase of an additional accessory.If like me, you plan to use the K cup with your own coffee - don't bother with the expensive purchase. Buy a small Mr Coffee type pot (4 cup or whatever) and be done with it. It is a pain to fill their cup and keep water level up etc.Go to the site to purchase the k cup for your own coffee and see the crap people go thru to make them work right - rubber bands, hair crunchies etc. Kind of stupid after spending a fortune on the Coffeemaker and having to buy the ""own coffee brew cup system"" seperately.ONLY BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER IF YOU ARE USING THEIR prefilled K CUPS.Nancy"
1,Wake up the Neighbors,"The coffee maker's motor shakes the maker so violently that the noise woke up the entire house. The instruction book will advise you that this is normal and customer service will explain that all models vibrate. Sometimes vibrations actually shook the cup off the maker while the coffee was brewing.You want to wake up to coffee not this ""jack hammer."" Terrible design. Keep looking."
2,Lasted less than a year and disappointing coffee,"I received my Keurig B40 Elite in Dec. of 2009. It died after a little less than a year of use. My neighbor had the same problem with his Keurig (different model, but it lasted less than a year, too). The pods are expensive, and you usually have to make a special trip to buy them as they are typically unavailable at the grocery store. The coffee can be a bit week. Keurig maintains that you can make a larger cup of coffee; however, it just pours more water through the same pod so it's just a larger, weaker cup of coffee. I liked the convenience of being able to brew a cup so quickly. I thought we would get more use out of having a variety of coffees and teas to choose from. We did not. Again, the pods are expensive. Overall, it was a huge disappointment. I wouldn't recommend to friends."
5,No more wasting coffee,i just love my new coffee macker becouse it lets me make how ever meany cups of coffee that i want and i dont wast any
1,Kuerigs are just Instant Coffee Vending Machines,"Keurigs are not ground coffee brewers. The only benefit to these things is, if you like a large variety of flavored instant coffees and you are too lazy to use a spoon."
2,"Plastic taste, too expensive","I just bought a Keurig B-40 Elite. We have tried 4 or 5 cups and there is still a very strong plastic smell & taste. Also, like to have my pot of coffee to add a little to my cup during the morning. We are Seniors & get Sr. coffee free when we're out, so just too expensive for us. I would rather make one good pot. Taking it back."
1,Horrible Custom service,"Mechanically this brewer works fine. However, I give Keurig customer service a big fat ""F"" grade. I placed an order with them and after nearly a month it has not arrived and they continue to give me the run around about fixing the problem. On *FOUR* different occasions customer service has promised me that a service technician would call me back within 24 hours to fix the problem. Every time they ""guarantee"" a call back. I have never once had them call me back to fix the problem. I will have to resort to seeking resolution through my bank. I would urge you to think about whether you want to do business with a company that fails to provide even basic customer service."
2,Disappointed in Amazon Keurig,"I ordered the Keurig B40 from Amazon for a gift. It was purchased as a new product. However, when it arrived it was definitely not new. It appeared to be a refurbished model and carton was secured with a yellow tape. Black markings were on the box. I have ordered many items from Amazon and have sung the praises of this company. This order was totally unacceptable and now I am hesitant to order from Amazon. Yes, Amazon paid for the return through UPS. I stayed home all day for UPS to pick up the box since telephone call said they would be by between 7AM and 6PM. They did not pick up the box. Finally 3 days later UPS picked it up.This is my 4th Keurig to buy. Overall I am pleased with the Keurig, but had to use this way to express dissatisfaction with Amazon."
3,Loud,"Good Machine; consistently good coffee. Very loud when priming (heating when first turned on or if hasn't been used for awhile) and takes up a lot of water, so you can end up refilling the reservoir very often - as few as three or four cups."
4,Very Convenient,"Have this model in my RV and the B-70 at home and love them both. Do like the larger cup size on the B-70, but easy enough to brew 2 k-cups with this model. If you are on the run like we are, it is much better than the traditional maker. We used a Capricci grinder/brewer but always had a mess left over and a lot of wasted coffee. This solves all of those problems plus we can each have the flavor we prefer. Have had no problems with either maker in the 6 or more months we have had them."
4,"A review of the travel model, the B30","The B30 is a fine product for travel or very limited space, but it is WELL worth the extra money to get any of the larger models. Do your research, there's an easy comparison tool on Keurig's website, but you'll find that while this one delivers the same wonderful coffee as the bigger ones, you'll have to refill the water for each cup, and, it takes a full 3 minutes to brew, while the other models hold enough water for 8 cups or so, and take only seconds to brew each cup. That being said, this an an adorable little machine, brews outstanding coffee, and is way quieter than the big ones."
1,Underwhelming compared to Nespresso,"I purchased the Keuring as a Christmas gift for my family, and the product turned out to be completely underwhelming. When I want to make two 'tall' coffees, 100% times the sizes come out unequal- one cup of coffee will be less full than the other. The taste of the Keurig-brewed coffee is, well, average at best. If you want to buy a coffee machine that will deliver every single time you use it, with quality and depth to the coffeee brewed, try any of the Nespresso coffee machines and inserts.I used Nespresso for 3 years while I lived in Europe, and had to say goodbye to the machine when we moved back to the US, because of the difference in voltage/electrical plugs. Now, I went the ""cheap route"" and thought that Keuring (which is about 100 bucks less expensive) will be just as good as Nespresso. I was wrong...."
1,Both Keurig B-40 brewers died,"I have to admit I have enjoyed the Keurig brewing system so much that after buying one for my home, I purchased one for work. Both on average are used about 1 cup per day. But the satisfaction level has died along with both machines dying, each less than 2 years old. From reading all of the reviews for this product and the B60 and B-70 models, the longevity of the brewer is notoriously low. The summary to me seems to be either you love or hate it depending on if it continues to works. Look at the ratings, the percentage with just 1 star is very high because the Keurig brewer has a poor track record. I will not reward Keurig by purchasing two more units to replace their defective brewers. I will find an option."
3,Not as nice as I thought,"There are 2 buttons, one for a large cup and one for a small cup- only problem is the large is not that large. It only fills up our coffee mug 3/4 of the way full- so we tried pressing the small button twice, to make up for the difference- and then the cup is too full (hugs the rim). So unless you are ever so careful first thing in the morning, you spill coffee everywhere trying to take the cup from the coffee maker. Also, it takes 4 minutes for the water to heat up. That is a long time when you are half awake, to wait for a cup of coffee. I liked my plain old mr coffee maker because i could program the coffee to be waiting for me when i woke up. This one makes me wait. The coffee does taste good however, and it's simple to use. I just wish it would have came with a programmable feature to have the coffee waiting for me, ready to go."
5,Love it,"This is the best coffee maker ever, the coffee ois wonderful too and I have one of these at home, work and my camper"
2,Good BUT.....,"We bought this the week of Thanksgiving and it is already broken. It will be going back to the store asap. However, we TRIED to go through the customer service on a Sunday night at 9:00 and the 1st rep was not helpful at all. I told her what was going on, will not heat up, the light never comes on and powers itself off after about 3 minutes. She tells me O just clean the needle that will fix the problem. After I said um no dont think so she presisted thats what it was. Ok we hung up cleaned the needle, gee imagine that its still not working. Called back and had a appt for a special rep to call us at 4:30 monday afternoon, here it is Thursday and we are STILL waiting on the call ! I knew it wasn't a good sign when we called at 9 on a Sunday night and they said they had a high call volume ! ! ! On the up side when it did work we LOVED it! Unsure if we will tempt this again or not as we cannot afford to drop 100 for a machine that won't even last a month ! !"
2,not great quality,Item was great when first received. After a few months began having problems - not filling the cups properly. Now the pump appears to be malfunctioning as well. I have followed the directions on how to clean the machine and it has not helped. I have had this machine for about 8 months. I would have expected it to last longer considering the price.
1,Terrible Coffee Maker,"Don't buy this machine if you enjoy a good cup of coffee. I purchased this machine and after brewing 2 cups of water downed tasteless coffee, I repacked the machine and sent it back. I was using the reusable Keurig filter and grinding my own Starbucks French Roast coffee. The reusable filter is absolutly useless in trying to brew a cup of strong coffee. To buy the K-packs and pay $.55 each is insane!!! I am now back to using my 4 cup ($29) Cusisinart coffee maker and enjoying my moring cup of coffee."
3,"was great for 2 years, then died","So just how long should a $150 coffee maker last??? More than 2 years, I think. This is how long my Keurig has lasted. It was great, it was perfect until about 6 months ago when we started getting the ""descale"" message, which I do not understand because we only use reverse osmosis water...anyway, we descaled probably 4 times, using vinegar and also the expensive pre-made descaling solution. Still the descale message. Then about 2 weeks ago, the fill line started malfunctioning, and NOW it will ONLY give us a large cup and that is ONLY when it feels like it, and it comes out as a trickle, delivering a COLD and DILUTED cup of coffee. I REALLY want to replace my Keurig, however now they are more expensive and of course, now I want the fancier model, but I just don't want to reward Keurig for their poor quality by buying another one. So I ask you...just how long should a $150.00 coffer maker be expected to last?"
2,Not Durable,"Have used one for 6-months. We use filtered water, recently tested as high quality. We also cleaned with Vinegar. Still, we frequently have to unplug the unit to hopefully ""re-cycle"" it to make it work (won't heat). Top (made of plastic) now sticks. Had to lubricate it with vaseline - inappropriate for a $140 device. We like the convenience, but will not buy another Elite model."
4,Good purchase overall,"The coffee maker isn't as pictured as no cup was included. The coffee was pretty good. I tried the donut shop version first. The unit is bit noisier than expected, but not horrific. A nice assortment of coffees in a 12 pack was included in the purchase price. Overall this is a good buy and I expect that I'll get a lot of use out of this item. The coffee maker was competitively priced. This was by far the best price when shipping was factored in that I could find online. A major retailer that I visited was selling the B30, an older model with less features, this weekend for the same price. Shipping was fast and the unit arrived in perfect condition within 3 days."
3,makes nice coffee but very loud (85 db) during brew,"This is a nice unit so long as no one is asleep when you make the first cup of coffee. I measured the unit at about 85 db during the brew cycle when it is pumping water (it pumps, then brews then pumps again)."
3,I have my fingers crossed...,When I first received my coffee maker I was THRILLED with it. After a few weeks it has developed a few issues. Every few brewings it either does not start the brew cycle or it does not complete a full cycle leaving me with half a cup of coffee.
3,A little moody device,I love how easy it is to make a cup of coffee especially at the crack of dawn but this coffee maker started acting up - brewing less than a cup or sometimes not even a drop - within weeks of purchase. We had to call customer service twice and they are replacing this.
5,Love it!,I surprised my husband with this coffee machine and he was overjoyed! It's quiet and delivers a great cup of coffee. It is also simple to use. We don't know what we ever did without it!
2,Short-term Life,"My daughter had a Keurig. made great coffee. She loved it, so I bought the B-40. She had a more expensive model. Loved my Keurig. Made great coffee for a little less than 6 months and then began pumping less coffee so a big mug held under 8 oz. I then descaled it even though the descale light was not on. Little improvement. Asked my daughter about hers. She told me she was on her second Keurig as the first one began pumping much less coffee. Now her second one is doing the same so she won't buy another. I misplaced by receipt so I bought a Bodum French Press from Amazon. Makes great coffee. Low tech. Not much can go wrong with it. My son said he thinks the problem with the Keurig is the pump. He's good at fixing things so I will ad to this review once he's done Would I recommend this to a friend? Nope."
2,very disappointed,"I received the Keurig elite for Christmas and was so disappointed at how it works. The coffee is so weak. I wouldn't say I like extra bold coffee, but I don't like watery coffee and this is exactly what you get. Some of the pods produce a better taste than others, but overall I find the coffee to be extra weak and it gets cold fast. I tried the Keurig Mini (2 separate units) and then the elite. I am returning this and going with another brand. I am bummed that I didn't like the Keurig--I wanted to like it badly!"
1,Yuch in every drop,"Noisy growling for each cup of coffee that is loud enough to wake the dead. Difficult to clean. Will not completely empty for transport. Now the Kcup coffee for these things has risen to $40 per pound. I regret ever purchasing this costly, obnoxious machine."
1,Keurig caused a house fire,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas 2011 present. It worked fine, we enjoyed it until two nights ago when were awakened by the smoke detector. The Keurig was engulfed in flames and the fire was speading quickly. We were so lucky to be able to get the fire out with an extinguisher, but not before a ton of smoke overtook the house. If you have one of these, I beg you to make sure you unplug it after each and every use! It is not enough to have it powered off. Things could have been so much worse, I am just happy that we were able to get the kids out of the house to safety. I will never buy another Keurig. That was the scariest thing to ever have to go through."
1,"Good coffee, bad everything else.","It makes a good cup of coffee, which should be the bottom line, but everything else about it sucks! It is extremely overpriced, at half the price. It is huge and takes up an enormous amount of counter space (to make a single cup of coffee?). It is also incredibly noisy - it bangs and pops unbelievably as it heats the water. If you want a good cup of coffee, get a small french press and be done with."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I've had mine for three days. THREE days! Already, the brewer handle won't close. It's now an expensive paperweight. (Don't lecture me about improper usage--I've had it 3 days & made 3 cups of coffee. There's nothing I've done wrong.) Called customer service & they ask a jillion completely irrelevant questions (name, e-mail, address, zip, etc.--seriously Keurig, can't you build a list of names to sell when we're NOT trying to get an answer for something?). No help at all. I'm going to return it & think long & hard about whether to replace it. A quick web search shows that this may be a fairly common problem with this unit. What a complete waste of money!"
2,did anybody who designed this actually turn it on????,"We replaced our old Keurig coffee maker with this one a few days ago. The old one wasn't bad, but it occasionally would mess up and grounds would go all over the place, and worst of all, when you removed the old grounds, it would always drip and make a mess all over the place.While I see that this new version has addressed these issues, It is obvious how they did it; they hooked up a Jet engine thruster to the device. I mean this thing actually shakes the entire kitchen; it is far louder than any alarm clock I have ever owned.This unit also adds two cup levels, regular and large, thank you for that.So for the work office, its a bit of amusement when people four doors down from the kitchen jump when the loud motor goes off, but I can only imagine in dread if I had this thing in my apt and wanted a cup of coffee while my wife was still asleep. She'd come at this machine with a sledge hammer."
1,Great at first but then.......,"We really liked the Keurig coffeemaker when we first bought it. It was fast and made a good cup of coffee despite the high price of the K-cups. But now, after owning it for 6 months it only puts out 1/2 of the water necessary to make a cup of coffee. We have used only filtered water the entire time we've used it. We have just cleaned out the system but it didn't help. I am not impressed after paying over $100 for this machine. Buyer beware!"
1,Zero for two,"I have received two brewers and both have been defective. The first worked about 3 days and then didn't complete the brew cycle, leaving about a half inch of water in the cup. Keurig replaced it with little fuss. The second brewer lasted about two weeks with a similar failure, but not quite the same. The third unit is on it's way, but needless to say, I have wasted too much time on this problem already and this will be the last."
1,Disappointed with Keurig,"I purchased this Keurig B-40 at the end of October. It worked great for about 2 weeks. Now I have to fight with it for 1/2 hour to get a cup of coffee. I've bought a bunch of k-cups and now can't hardly use them. I'm really disappointed. When you turn the machine on, there is a humming, and if you're lucky you can hear water moving around in there. Sometimes I'll get a half cup of coffee. If I unplug and turn it back on, I can sometimes get another half cup. If I play with it long enough (I'm desperate at this point,) I can eventually get a full cup of coffee... but it's frustrating and I might as well drive to starbuck for the half-hour I have to fight with this machine. Going back to a regular coffee maker."
2,Not for a True Coffee Lover,"If you love a strong cup of coffee this machine is not for you.I purchased the Keurig, along with a refillable cup to use with our beloved, locally roasted and freshly ground coffee beans. I was expecting to have an out-of-body experience due to all the hype I've heard about the Keurig. However, no matter how much coffee I packed into the cup I simply could not get a coffee that didn't taste weak and watered down. Plus the water storage tank continually leaked out of the bottom. We returned our machine and happily went back to using our old coffee maker."
2,this coffee fad is bad,"On 7/19/11 I bought the Keurig Elite and I will without a doubt be returning mine. I am a very avid coffee drinker and enthusiast, so I am a little particular with my coffee. I personally thought the coffee tasted burnt and really dulled the flavored coffee's taste. I also tried my regular favorite bean using the re-usable filter...I became even less impressed with the Keurig. My favorite brew tasted horrible in comparison. Not to mention, it did not make or leave the aroma of fresh brewed coffee (well maybe for a half a minute or so). I'll stick with my simple pot, and not fall for the fad again. (side note-I ran through a couple of gallons of water and when that didn't work, I tried vinegar and ran a couple more gallons through. It didn't help)"
1,"Expensive, Expensive to use, Poor Service","Puchased the coffee maker for a Christmas Present. Used for a couple of weeks, and it started leaking. Called Customer Service, They quizzed me on everything except to help me with the leaking problem. Never was resolved. With Quality and Service like this, I would not recommend it to anyone. Beside being very expensive, it is very expensive to use. There must be a big problem with leaking that the company does not want to address."
3,Splashes because of poor design,"I received my Keurig B40 as a gift. I gave it three stars because of the simplicity of making a great cup of coffee. However, because of poor design, unless one is using a VERY tall cup, coffee that is pouring SPLASHES into coffee that is already in the cup. I have to hold my cup up to the spout while it is pouring to keep it from splashing on my white counter. If the drip tray were adjustable to different heights, that would probably solve the problem. I am trying to figure out a way to elevate the drip tray to bring my cup closer to the spout. I have been using this coffee maker since April and have not had a bad cup of coffee."
2,Be Careful! My Keurig Blew Up!!!!,"I love coffee. I loved my Keurig B40 Elite. My kids gave this to me as a mother's day gift two years ago. Up until about 4 months ago, my machine was a dream. I went to bed at night, thinking about waking in the morning to my fresh brewed coffee. Ahhh... About 4 months ago, my machine started making noises. Weird noises; hissing, burping, so weird I had to shut the machine off manually at night because it kept me awake. Today, I pulled up the handle, hit the blue button on the right and it literally blew up. A streak of flame ran across the bottom of the brewer and then the entire machine starting smoking. I immediately pulled the plug from the wall, let it cool down and tossed it in the trash. Be careful. If your machine starts making weird noises either contact the store where you bought it for a refund or at the least, unplug the machine at night as it could be a serious fire hazard."
4,Awesome Product!,I've had other one cup brewers and this is by far the best. I also use the reusable k cup to use other coffee or tea and that's also good if you don't want to always buy the one cup k cups that are in stores. I've made iced coffee and tea and it tastes good. Plus it's perfect for the morning cup for work.
5,I love this coffee maker,"A friend of mine has this and I used it at her house and I had to buy one. I love it. I can make 4 different flavors of coffee for 4 different people. It is fast, simple and I never waste half a pot of coffee like I used to. I get a perfect cup every time.I wake up, turn it on, wash my face and brush my teeth, go to the Keurig and put my K-cup in, push the lid down and press the blue button - 30 seconds later, yummy coffeeYou get the strength you want, the flavor you want, the amount you want.I got the one without the bells and whistles and it is perfect for me. I am glad that this one has two sizes and the automatic shut off option... I love the automatic shut off..."
4,Great product,"I bought one of these for the house because I had one at work and it is great to have. It is really nice trying all the different flavors of coffee and what not. It is simple to use and easy to clean. It is also very fast. You have your coffee ready in less than a minute.I have very few gripes. One is cost. Its not too bad but its not cheap either. The other is that it creates a lot of waste. You are tossing little plastic K-cups after every use. That makes the little ""My K-cups"" that much more attractive."
5,Keurig single cup brewing system,"This coffee system is so easy to use, just fill with water and select your favorite coffee, press the brew button, that's it! I love this brewing system and will buy another for a friend or to replace mine if it breaks."
1,Design flaws,"I purchased the B40 from Keurig's website, and it worked correctly maybe twice. Then it started not pumping any water, or at times would brew a partial cup. Usually it would just sit there and do nothing, then the lights would go haywire. I found the brew strength to be highly inadequate as well. No way do I want another one of these machines, and I'm getting a refund. If you read the customer reviews on Keurig's own website, you'll see a pattern of these problems so there is obviously a design flaw. Overall a bad experience with an expensive appliance. I've been pouring the coffee out of the k-cups into my old drip brewer, and the coffee tastes much better that way!"
2,Good machine - while it lasts,"This is the second Keurig I bought in 4 years. Very convenient - while it works. Despite using filtered water, regular descaling, etc., they seem to simply stop working after 2 years. Warranty is only for a year, so this ends up making them pretty expensive. Wish the company would do more to ensure longer lasting product."
4,It is just great,"It is just great. No problems. It is recommended for all models that you decaled every 3-6 months. Use a paper clip to clean the coffee grain in the holder, and the around the above needle. If you have a problem call them. And remember to register your machine."
3,Don't waste your money,"Listen, I've owned 3 Keurigs in my lifetime. One has lasted a year with average daily use... 1-2 cups per day. The B40 I had in my office lasted 2 years... at about 3-4 cups brewed a week. The 3rd Keurig has lasted about 5 months thus far. I love the machine but the quality absolutely is awful."
2,Very Dissapointed,"I enjoyed the coffee this machine made when I first purchased it. However, after about a year the pump put less and less water into the cup and the machine can't be repaired. It bothered me that I had throw this machine away after such a short time."
5,GREAT!,Don't wast money buying a more expensive models. The B40 is great and has everything you'll need. Get a My K cup and use your own coffee.
4,"Love it, but it broke on me","The B-40 is great, I have one at work that has been beat up for years with no issues. When I purchased one for the house, however, it started putting out small concentrated amounts of coffee, about 6 months later. Then it stopped putting out any.One the plus side, I called the warranty center and they were so helpful. My new one is on it's way! Can't wait, it's a great product and you WILL get attached to it."
1,Good while it lasts,This is my 2nd unit. The first stopped working at 13 months. The descaling light wouldn't go off despite performing the descaling process 3 times. Be aware I only use distilled water in my unit so descaling shouldn't be an issue. My wife loved it and I had a substantial supply of K-Cups so I was forced to buy another one. This one was much more quieter than the first which sounded like a plane taking off. But now the noise has been getting much louder and it is turning itself off. This time I have only a minimal supply of K-Cups so if it breaks I am done with Keurig.
3,It's okay,"My husband is really the coffee drinker. He likes the machine but says that it doesn't brew very hot beverages. He has to put is drinks in the microwave for about 45 seconds to make it really hot and stay hot. Otherwise, he seems happy with this product."
3,Worked great for almost 16 months and then quit suddenly!,"Our Keurig B-40 Elite has worked well since purchasing it on November 16, 2010. I counted up the orders of K-cups we've gone through and there were 36 cases just ordered from Amazon alone. I know we've used a couple of boxes purchased at Sam's Club and elsewhere besides. So, we've run at least 1800 K-cups through it. In that amount of time the needle that pierces the cup got plugged up twice. I've kept it clean and have operated it according to the instructions. In fact, it was lit up when we left to run errands today and when we returned in less than an hour... it was dark and will not work no matter what I do with it. Perhaps we got a power surge and the circuit board gave up.So, it worked well when it was working but didn't last very long in my opinion. So, I gave it a 3-star rating."
4,Keurig B40,"The Keurig B40 is a very easy coffee maker to use and it produces a reasonable cup of coffee. I did purchase my own reusable cup for coffee grounds and I have found that it uses less coffee in producing one cup of coffee, than other coffee brewers. However, the flavor is not quite up to the coffee from my prior coffee maker which was a Cuisanart machine that would grind the beans each morning. Still, for ease of use, clean-up, and speed, the Keurig B40 is very nice."
3,Keurig Elite Bug Collector,"I'll start by saying the idea of single cup brewing systems is awesome. I have owned 3 Platinum systems, the first being a gift that worked for a little over a year then one day quit working completely. I returned the system and was given a replacement which worked for close to a year, again returning for a replacement. This system faulted around 6 months and I returned it for the Elite system. The Elite works like a charm with the same fantastic cups of coffee with some added protein (bugs that are attracted to the light in the water reservoir). Because the lid on the water tank has a gap in the fitting it allows these little bugs to go swimming in the tank and have on several occasions ended up in my cup of coffee! I've submitted this problem to Keurig with no response, so I've remedied the situation by placing a sheet of plastic wrap over the tank before putting the lid on... works great but looks pretty dumb!"
1,Piece of garbage,"My Keurig machine stopped working all together , I had it about 14 mos, first it stopped making full cups, now it wont turn on at all, Keurig offered me a New machine for $69, I declined, between the overpriced Kcups and poor quality of their machines I'll go back to my $25 Black and Decker that has worked for over 5 years without a hitch!"
2,Disappointed,"Traded in my $45 Senseo for a $120 Keurig Elite. Bad decision. I get coffee once out of every four tries. The other times I get flashing lights and motor noise. Keurig customer support said to watch a video - I said give me back my Senseo. Senseo was cheaper, and it worked."
4,so convenient,I am all about convenience lately. Probably because of the toddler bouncing in my lap. And it is SO nice to have my coffee so easily when he takes so much of my time.Finer grounds will make a stronger cup if you use the My K-Cup.
2,"Great Coffee, No Durability","I had read some reviews of the various Keurig coffeemakers prior to buying one. Generally, people were happy with the coffee, but several people mentioned that they don't last. I went ahead and bought one anyway. It has made great tasting coffee - I love having a fresh cup whenever I want, within a minute or two. However, mine no longer functions correctly, only six months after purchase. Given the cost of the coffeemaker and the k-cups, and it's short lifespan, I would not call it a great value."
2,keurig didn't last one year,Worked fine until today. No power to product. Bought it in February 2010. Trying to exchange it for a new one.
5,Convenient and Easy!!,This is such an easy coffee maker. We use one at the office and I love it so much I bought this for my home too. I like that it comes with a variety pack to sample out of the box.
4,Very Pleased,"I have been overall very happy with my new Keurig. The only objection we have is that sometimes teas and hot chocolates do not seem to come out right. I have noticed if we fill the Keurig with hotter water, the results are better."
1,"Always breaks down, too many moving parts. Poor quality coffee","I have already returned this coffee maker to the store. When they work they're ok, but usually the flashing fault lights are going off, which means maintenance needs to be done. the little reusable K-cup is no good either. The water usually will not pass through it and it will blow the k-cup holder open and water will flow around it and not even pass through the grinds, unless your grinds are very coarse. The non reusable K-cups are your best bet, however, it will taste like coffee you get from a vending machine. please, Don't waste your money."
3,Works ....but doesn't work.....,After making about 2 weeks worth of coffee...ALL IS FINE. THEN somethingweird happens. After making about 2 cups of coffee....the blue add waterlight comes on..even when the tank is filled to the brim...and theheating light is on..but nothing happens. I have to then..unplug it..which I guess resets it....then it works fine for a couple more cups.WHICH IS AGGRAVATING. Would send it back..but I guess since is makescoffee.. I am gonna keep it. But needless to say...VERY disappointed in thequality of this unit.
5,I love my Keurig!,"I love this coffee maker! We have had one of these at work for about 4 months, and with repeated daily use (6-10 cups a day) it works as great as the day we got it! I love the variety of coffee available, I love how quick it heats up and makes a cup of coffee... I love it so much that I just bought one for home!!! It is true that it is not the most economical way to drink coffee (around .50 a cup if you drink it black and get a good deal on k-cups)... but because it is so super easy I won't be stopping somewhere else for coffee because I just didn't have time or didn't want to make a pot that I would only drink a cup out of. Bottom Line: Fast, you won't get bored because there is a huge variety out there, attractive, well made... if you love coffee then you will love owning a Keurig. Period. Don't hesitate. HIGHLY recommend!!!"
5,Great Coffee,Each cup is so fresh and good. Easy to use and no messy grounds to clean. Will probably give one as a gift.
2,poor quality,"I'm not a fan. It's a cute toy, but I'll take regular brewed. The quality is poor and unsatisfactory compared to other single-serve brands I have tried. If you calculate cost per cup, this is a much more expensive alternative for a low quality tasting coffee."
2,My K-cup accessory is poor,"I was very excited to recieve the Keurig coffee maker with the idea that they have this great accessory that will allow you to avoid the cost of the pre-packaged K-cups and pick the coffee you want to brew. Well the thing does not work and I feel Keurig made it poorly on purpose so that you would need to purchase coffee packeged their way. While the fitting that comes with the brewer and holds the prepackaged K-cups snaps into place the My K-Cup accessory just sits there. The result: some brown coffee comes through but clear water also comes out in numerous flows into your cup, resulting in the weakest brew you will ever have. Needless to say I returned the accessory and the coffee maker."
1,Cheap Chinese Junk,"Our Elite brewer lasted approx 1 year and a couple of months. My wife enjoys a variety of flavors in the disposable cups, and I use the solo fill cup.Personally If I want to spend 50 cents on a single cup of coffee every morning, I'd go to MacDonalds. My only option was to buy another brewer at a discount,and send a part back from my old brewer (the detachable cup holder). I assume they are a little short on spares. This brewer is just another pieceof expensive throw away Chinese junk. Personally I wouldn't own one, but if momma ain't happy, nobody's happy, so lets buy another piece of Chinese crap,we've just got to keep those Chinese employed!!!."
1,Wasteful!!!,"I received this ""brewing system"" for Christmas last year and stopped using it after a few months. I couldn't continue to use these wasteful little plastic cups in good conscience.I tried several different brands of coffee and tea but they all ended up tasting like burnt plastic. I cannot recommend this product."
3,"Great, but be careful","We used our Keurig B40 happily for 2.5 years.And then it got roaches.Google Keurig + roach and you'll see that it isn't terribly uncommon for this to happen.Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about it beyond throwing the machine out."
2,not worth it for me,"I didn't have much luck with this. The heating element only worked half the time and the whole K-Cup system seemed designed to rip off the customer (I can see it's convenience though).It's been mentioned, but if you drink more than 8oz of coffee in the morning, this will irritate you to no end. I ended up getting one for half the price that performs much better than this model."
5,"I am so happy with my Keurig, even after using it every day for all occasions!","Perfect for two, or a crowd. It's fast enough to handle it all. About the K-cup filter basket for using your own coffee: You must have the container to put the filter in, and replace the one that holds the store bought K-cups which comes with the Keurig. Without this, water will splash out and make a mess! Then don't forget to replace the holder for the ready made cups when you use them. I works perfectly if done correctly."
1,Its Crap,"Do Not buy this Brewer ! This is my third Elite Brewer and all three had the same problem, the brewer will stop brewing a full cup of coffee after a couple of months of use. It was told to me that it was a design flaw but when I asked if it could be replaced with a different model they told me only if I pay for it. Kerig's customer service was great the first time and replaced the brewer for free but by the third time they didnt want to hear it. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they had none availible and someone would call me back.....still waiting. Obviously this model has a defect that has not been fixed and all Kerig will do is replace one faulty model with another. Save your money and look elseware for a reliable brewer."
2,Convenience but a dead cup of coffee,"I bought the Elite 40 from my local big box, and after about three months I have had zero problems with my coffee maker. Also I did have had business with Keurig's customer support, and they were terrific!I have bought lots and lots of different k-cup flavors these months but for me none of them delivered a desirable cup of coffee. Basically all are rather odorless across all brands & flavors I would conclude the taste is generally just a slight notch above instant--and does not even approach good brewed coffee. One marketer pulled a fast one on me, and actually packed freeze dried crystals in their k-cup! Sigh.I am now ending my Keurig quest, and I am shopping for an old style percolator pot hopefully in a more personal 2-cup size."
4,"A few days in, so far so good.",I have had the B40 for several days now and am enjoying it so far. I have used it twice a day without any problems. It brews up a good cup of coffee and am still working on finding my favorite K-Cup. Enjoying the Extra Bold varieties in the 9.25oz setting. No issues with noise or any other complaints for that matter. Will update this review after I have more time using the B40.
4,Second times a charm,"I bought my first Keurig and it didn't work right. It wouldn't prime, the lights never came on, ect. I returned it and replaced it with an identical model. I love it. It'w well worth the space on my counter. I bought a pack of K-Cup lids, so now I can can heat hot water in it. I'm glad I didn't give up after the first problem."
5,It's Coffee Time!!,"My parent had bought us a Keurig coffee maker two years ago for Christmas and we absolutely fell in love with it. I decided we needed one at work and when I saw the great price through Amazon, I bought it! Now I am the most popular person in the building. Everyone comes and gets a great cup of coffee in an instant. No more running to Starbuck's to get that afternoon jolt- we have have it right at our fingertips. You have to try this product- trust me you will get hooked!"
2,Took it back,"Purchased model B40 because it was smaller and would take less counter space and from what we could tell, the quality of coffee from the various Keurig machines would be the same. Went through the initial setup without problem and the 1st cup of coffee came out without a hitch. Next morning, even though the B40 was set for the larger brew, only 1/2 cup came out. Extra water was in the drip tray but but the cup was centered and there was no indication the water missed the cup. Next cup, same problem. 3rd cup worked OK. Later that morning my wife had the exact same problem so back to the store the unit went. Bed Bath & Beyond was great with the return so we stepped up to the Platinum B70 model and two days later, just great coffee and tea without problems. Also bought theK-cup reusable coffee filter but haven't tried it yet. Will report back."
4,No regrets!!!,I recently bought this item during the sales of black Friday and have no regrets!! It makes a great cup of Joe each and every time. Only issue I have so far is that in order to fill your travel mug you have to run the cycle twice using two k cups which is not a big deal when u think about it because it's still cheaper than buying the same size at your local coffee shop. The clean up process is very easy and fast. Just a simple wipe down and rinse of the water reservoir and that's it!I would recommend this product to anyone that considers themselves a coffee enthusiast on the run. With so many different varieties of k cups on the market your taste buds will never get bored!
1,Enjoy It While It Lasts,"I was completely fooled into thinking this was the best coffee maker I'd ever had. I admit that for a while, it was. ""A while"" being the key words. A coffee maker that costs over a hundred dollars should last a lot more than a year. But after a year, this thing started getting really unreliable. By a year a half, it was just dead. All just in time for the warranty to end, naturally. I don't think coffee makers should be considered disposable. I've had cheap coffee machines last a decade. It's not asking too much that a pricey one last at least half as long as my $10 one.So, in the short term, enjoy your quick, convenient one-cup brewing. But don't expect the honeymoon to last."
1,Doesn't last,"The B40 worked well for a little over a year. The brewer produced a good cup of coffee, and since our water is good quality, we had no scale issues. The electronics completely quit-no lights sounds, nothing when plugged into a known good outlet. I took the cover off to check for a fuse, but there are none. No servicable power management components is a cheap shortcut that should not be taken on a $120 coffee maker. Shame on Keurig, I'm done with you."
2,They need a competitor,"As I read the latest reviews, I find myself in the same boat as many others. This product worked beautifully for 9 months then died. I believe its the water pump, as others have said. By now Keurig surely knows the problem and still sells it without remorse. If they had a competitor with a comparable product they would correct the problem immediately. They have no pride in what they do. Don't buy this product, there's a good chance it will stop working in less than a year. Now what do I do with all of the Krupp cups I have? Amazon should not disgrace itself by selling this faulty item."
5,EXCELLENT COFFEE MAKER!!,"This is one of the best coffee makers that I have ever purchased and was well worth the money. I never knew that coffee making could be so easy now with the K-cups that have the premeasured amount of coffee already. You just pop one of these K-cups in and in about a minute your coffee is in your cup. The flavors are fantastic. You can even make your hot chocolate or teas with the premeasured K-cups, as well. This is truly a must buy for all those who enjoy their coffee. It makes life so much easier now. Buy one and you won't ever regret it. It's the best way to enjoy that cup of coffee that you love!! Excellent!!"
3,Good while it lasted,"The Keurig concept is great, and I am a total addict. You get a good cup of coffee, brewed quickly, whenever you want. You can choose, cup by cup, what you want to drink, and the possibilities are extensive. Coffee, tea, cocoa, whatever.The problem I encountered is reliability. I have had four Keurig brewers fail in about six years. The first three were the fancier ""Platinum"" models, and the last was the simpler ""Elite"". Customer support is good, and Keurig replaced one unit that was out of warranty (wow!) and another that was in warranty. I like the brewers, I like the coffee, and like Keurig customer support; I don't like the reliability.So what now? I got a Mr. Coffee unit that brews Keurig K-cups. Let's see how long it lasts ..."
3,Xtra coffee maker.,"Bought this as a second coffee maker to take with me on extended trips. It works fine, but is a bit noisy. The larger machine we have (64oz) is nice and quiet, and also makes a larger cup. But both work fine!"
2,Senseo is much better,"Imus was touting this coffee maker so I bought one. Thanks a bunch Imus! I also have a Senseo which I highly recommend. If you like great coffee get the Senseo, it's half the price of the Keurig. Get the Keurig if you want to pay a lot for a coffee maker that also makes weak ordinary but expensive coffee and tea. I only use this disaster when I fill the (optional for $15 more dollars) coffee holder screen thingy with my own coffee."
4,An award-winning look at the problem of introduced species,"Alien Invaders looks at one of our planet's most serious environmental problems: the problem of introduced species. In clear, well-documented text, the book describes in detail the history and catastrophic results of human transportation of non-native species. It also describes what we can do to help alleviate the problem. This book was names as a Best Book for the Teen Age by the New York Public Library and received the highest rating from SCIENCE BOOKS AND TAPES, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science."
1,Cuts like a hammer,"There's no nice way to say it, the blades are dull. Seems nicely constructed, but the knives just aren't sharp. Very difficult to cut with and makes poor, ragged slices. Wasted money."
1,Product in picture you showed is stainless steel but I received a black plastic one !,Product I ordered was diferent than the one I received. I bought a stainless steel mandolin as the one in picture you showed but I received a black plastic mandolin. I don't want this one. Help me
1,Why are all the reviewers named Charlotte?,"I am in the market for a book on this topic, but too many of these reviews seem faked up -- multiple reviews by Charlotte from London; exact same wording submitted under different names. At this point, I don't care if the book is any good or not -- your overkill has cost you a sale."
1,TOO MUCH ADVICE NOT RELATED TO THE FACE,I too bought Natural Facelift based on all the positive reviews here. The book is extremely difficult to follow as one has to sift through so much bable to get to the exercises. The photos and instructions are inadequate to say the least. Ms. Kando also gives some unqualified and very bizaare advice for self dental treatment! This book is worthless.
3,Pretty Comprehensive,"I just purchased this book yesterday at a bookstore and read it cover to cover. I found it fascinating, and I am glad that she included a lot of additional material about posture, etc. I think that is a better approach than simply outlining some exercises. I don't yet know if I'll get results from this as I haven't tried the exercises yet. I agree with the reviewer above that there should have been more pictures used to explain some of the movements. I'm hoping that I can figure them out with just the written descriptions. I'd welcome a discussion with anyone else who has used the exercises with success. Good luck to us all!"
1,Not Worth Your Money,I also am wondering if all the positive reviews are legitimate. I went to the bookstore to check it out & found the book to be fairly useless. Lots of text & needless exercises for the body. The few exercises listed for the face had unclear photos that are not very helpful. I say save your money or you might be very disappointed.
5,Just what I was Looking for,When I looked at my face in the mirror my husband said I was getting a double chin. I am not the type who likes to let herself go so I bought Juliette Kando's Natural Facelift and started doing the exercises. Within a week I could already feel my face toning up and people remarked on how well I looked. Now that I have been sticking to it for two months my double chin is gone and my eye bags are nearly gone. It's absolutely amazing and I recommend it to everybody. I am very glad to have this opportunity to tell people about it. I'll definitely keep the book for my children when they get older.
2,not pleased.,"Against my better judgement I recently purchased 2 video now colors. This toy is not something I wanted to buy due to the limited amt. of disc to view. I pictured the toy collecting dust soon after the puchase. My daughter played with the toy on the first day, shortly after the screen went black! I changed the batteries and within a couple of minutes it happened again. My child is disappointed and I have to buy this toy reluctantly, again! This time I will keep the package it comes in. Don't buy until they improve the hardware. I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that one out if the two do work, for right now."
4,my son loves this...,"I bought my son(who is 5) a VideoNow and my daughter(who is 2) a VideoNow Jr. for Christmas. THEY LOVE THEM. I have never had a problem w/ either of them like other reviewers. These things have been dropped and banged around too and still no problems. It is now Februray and I replaced each of their batteries only once and there are days they don't use it and other days its on for an hour or more. Also they can watch each others dics which is great. Did I mention I bought the Video Jr. on clearance at Target for $8.66 and the Video now at Toys R Us for $12.50!!!!!!!!!!!!! BARGINNNNNNNN!!!!!Highly recomend them, they are GREAT for a car ride but get a few sets of head phones! :)"
2,Be ready to buy stock in batteries,"We bought two video now Colors, and a video Now Jr. for our kids, thinking it would be fun for the car. However with standard batteries not one of them lasts for more than 5 minutes. I spent money on the more expensive (M3) batteries, and they seem to last longer. However at $9 a pack that seems a bit pricey, even the rechargables don't hold up well in the players."
3,good but eats to much batteries,i bought this when it first came out for my son he has been seeing reruns of the same show for hours if your going to buy this you shoulde be pepared to get your wallet to buy more videos...
2,On my second and still no luck.,"Great idea BUT this is our second and neither have worked properly. The first was a Christmas gift for my three year old and only one day and two battery changes later it quit working. Now my second, which was purchased only yesterday, has also quit. Just as the other reviewer commented it went black and there was no sound. I have tried changing batteries numerous times and still no luck. However my son LOVES it so I am going to try again with hopes that third times a charm."
1,video now in color IS A BIG FAT RIP OF FOR PARENTS OUT THERE,it sucks the first day i got it for my b-day i was watching a video with it and it just cut out on me and when i tried to turn it on agian it short circited giving me a very painful shock.THAT IS WHY THIS TOY SUCKS
3,"Wrong item, but good customer service","I had ordered a WiFi card that was supposed to be a specific part number for my IBM R40 ThinkPad laptop. It arrived in regular bubble wrap - not ESD safe, and it was the wrong part number and did not work with my laptop. It was an inconvenience for me to ship it back, but at least I got a full refund in a timely manner."
3,good but where is the music?,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.I have quite a few other workout DVDs from this instructor --- she usually delivers a challenging workout and this is also good (although not as tough as some of her others.)Why does this workout have no audible music? It is weird. Not motivating at all. Instructor is good but does not have the voice for shouting and her voice gets whiny/shrieky, so a music only option would solve a lot of problems."
5,The Greatest Book Written on Raising Children,"As a pastor, and a father of four, I have always hoped for 1 book, definitive and courageous, to give out to families in desperate need of guidance for their family. I needed a book to cover the hard facts, without compromise... This is that one book. Every pastor should own this book, for the good of his family, and the good of his flock. In the Christian home, teenage rebellion, although common, is not normal. It is not acceptable. It does not have to be this way."
4,good read,"The book is well written and I enjoyed. It's not a page turner, and some parts of the book take a little time to sink in. I have recommended this to all the parents I child sit for because the basic principles are there and its all laid out in black and white."
3,A good basic introduction,"This book is a good basic introduction to the Australian Shepherd, but if you are looking for detailed information about preparing for the competitive arena in any venue, you may be disappointed."
5,Wonderful Information.,"I am new to the painting world. I found this book to be full of wonderful information to get me started. Not only does it cover painting technique, but it also teaches you how to properly prepare and create the initial sketch. It's a very interesting and informative book."
2,?????????????????????,"Mainly, I'd just like to comment on the new studio songs. What year is this, 1987? I would have loved these back then but hearing them in 2007 doesn't work for me. I hate when Coverdale sings in the high register. His voice works so much better in the lower range. He is trying too hard!As far as the live stuff, it didn't do it for me either. I just ordered my copy of the remastered ""Live in the Heart of the City"". That should get the bad taste out!Live in the Heart of the City"
5,Whitesnake storms back,"David Coverdale has really put together an amazing lineup for the return of the Snake. Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach on guitars is a explosive combination. Coverdale could sound great anyone but that just would not be his style. He always puts together the best quality and, therefore, the final product is true to his form."
5,Correction to prior comment!!!!,"I made a mistake and put a negative comment about this company. I need to make a correction....this company is actually great and provides great customer service, and I recommend their service."
4,"Inspiring, Hopeful","The language is rather coarse at times, perhaps too explicit--but it was an interesting ""no holds barred"" book."
3,Inner City Miracle,"Straightforward, uncensored, and no sugarcoating, Mathis tells it like it was growing up in Detroit. Raised primarily by his single parent mother, he was a hustler, thug, and all-around devious little fellow, but his mother's cancer diagnosis caused him to change his dishonorable ways. He turned his life around, got his GED, bachelor's degree, law degree, and was an elected district judge. How's that for irony.A quick read that's written in a style that makes you feel like you were sitting in his chambers listening to him tell his tale. Some strong language throughout, but I think this would be a good book for teens. I hope there's a follow-up that talks more about his TV show. 3.5 stars!"
4,Good,"I won't lie. At first, I put off by Judge Mathis' book. The cussing and put downs about the Seventh day Adventist church of which I belong,(though deep down, I know of which he talked) I could understand and move on from there. One thing I learned from this book is that one can pay for their past dearly, and in the Judge's case, he had to more than once especially when he tried to get his law license and what not. I feel the book is an inspiration to young folk anywhere. See, this man was headed to jail or death the rate he was going. But thanks to a mother who loved him and probably wore out the floor praying for him, was able to rise above his circumstances. A great book by a great American."
2,Which Siblings Succedd and Why,"I rate this book a two only because I am giving it the benefit of a doubt that it has to get better the more you read!? I think the subject matter is interesting, however, it might be more suitable for a magazine article. This book was much too much like reading a textbook, and I several times I had to reread paragraphs hoping to get more meaning from them. I could not make it through the whole book."
2,Waste of Time,"I had high hopes for this book, but it was a terrible disappointment. The author rambles on and on, citing different studies that do no more than state the obvious. I mean, everyone knows that children of parents with more resources have a better chance of success than children of parents that are struggling. I didn't need a book to point that one out. I really learned nothing new from this book, except that perhaps the author wanted to whine about his own childhood, especially in the last chapter."
3,Not very meaty,"The premise of this book really draws you in, especially if you've read anything on the subject of family dynamics and development. There are some very interesting observations on, and in some cases contradictions of, popular ideas. I definitely found myself considering my own childhood, and I can certainly see how this book would stir the mind of parents. Unfortunately, I was left wanting. There are very few actual conclusions made by the author despite the numerous anecdotes used to (supposedly) present his arguments."
4,Role models for young girls,"While the image of Barbie and her friends has been portrayed as ""young"", ""hip"", ""fresh"" etc..., the example for very young girls (5-6-7 years) is abominable. Hearing the girls state, ""That bites"" really has no business in the script. There are many other ways that that could have been stated. The girls language as well as their provocative outfits are what is creating the attitudes of todays young girls and is VERY influential as well as DESTRUCTIVE to little girls. This product should be marketed to an older crowd. Mind you, I'm not trying to keep my child in Mary jane shoes and pigtails her whole life, but this is just unacceptable. No more Barbies' for us."
5,Finally--A book that approaches this taboo topic,"Kudos to the authors for exploring the topic of what happens to the ""exceptions"" (children born of rape). Rather than just giving statistics (you will note how usually, the pro-life or pro-choice movements merely make reference to us, as it furthers their own cause), the book gives real-life scenarios. Although the message is clearly that the children of these circumstances deserve life, it's nice to hear from some real people, rather than shadowy statistics. We do exist, and it's time people realize this!"
5,A must read for those who want it all . . . power and truth!,"Banister has an outstanding ability to bring reason and passion together. This is the blueprint for the church in the next century. So many of us know that we want more, but ignorantly hold to what's comfortable . . . and hauntingly dissatisfying.The Word and Power Church will hopefully become a rallying cry for the body of Christ to embrace the Truth of God's Word and the Power of His Spirit."
5,Amazing! Breaks Down The Walls!,This book is a comparison of an Evangelical Pastor's journey into the world of Charismatics...and he finds out we are not so different after all. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a hunger for all God has to offer us. The research is excellent. The writing is engaging. It asks questions that will make you hunger for more. Read it!
4,Works like it should,"I've been using several of these for 3 months now, and it works and looks good. It does what it's supposed to and I couldn't ask for more. If you need a basic volume control, grab it now and install. No regrets here."
3,Very Interesting And Uneven In Spots!,"Although difficult to locate, this 1998 Grail (1970) digipack CD from Second Battle Records (Germany) is worthwile to pick up just for ""Grail"" (nice sitar) and ""Day After Day.""Grail was only about for a very short period (1968-1970) and only recored this one album. The beginning sfor Grail go back to the legendary Mod band, The Game. Grail lead vocalist, Chris Williams, audtioned for the spot as the replacement singer in The Game in 1968. The band soon changed their name from The Game to Grail and were picked up by NEMS. The band's sound does not really bare any resembalance to The Game's recorded sound. The album was produced by Rod Stewart, who happened to be a friend of their manager, Bob Pearce.The sound is early UK porgressive with sitar in spots, flutes, cello, autoharp, clarinet, and tabla. Only three rel strong songs, in my humble, which are: Day After Day, Grail, & Camel Dung. Day After Day is a winner."
5,"savvy book, savvy narrator","In Bruiser, Ian Chorao has handed us the best kind of narrator - one who tells a tough story with joy and humor, and keeps the reader's interest from beginning to end. Buy it, because you'll want to read it more than once."
1,?,Was this book actually written by a 3rd Grader? Because it certainly reads that way. Makes you wonder how this ever saw the light of day.
5,Surprising!!!,".You think of the thousands of books written about The First World War and wonder, ""Could anyone possibly have anything new to say about the subject?"".The answer is 'yes'. Meyer's book is refreshing.The best parts of this book are the short 'Background' pieces that end each chapter. It adds an depth of understanding about the war in short (3-4 pages) bites. If you want to get a good taste of this book, turn to page 419 and read the four page background piece, 'Consuming The Future'. Meyer spells out in a language anyone can understand how the First World War destroyed the economies of all the European powers.Not only the best WWI book I've read, but one of the best books on any subject I've read in the past 5 years.."
2,Book Literally fell apart,"While this is a good history of the First World War, the manufacture of is the worst possible. It literally fell apart as I was reading it. I had to read most of the book out of sections that fell out of the binding. The only sections still in the book were ones I glued in myself after they fell out. It is currently in nine parts. I considered sending it back, but that was way too much hassle. It is much easier for me to hold hard feelings than go through the trouble of sending it back, explaining when I bought it, trying to find proof of purchase, etc. If you really want the history buy the book, but don't expect it to be an easy read because you will have to fight the book falling apart while trying to read it."
2,Book fell apart,"My husband began reading this book immediately when it arrived. He got a lot of enjoyment from it and from his reaction, I would give it 4 stars. However, halfway through the book, the entire second half came unglued from the spine from normal reading and not from abuse. Now, the pages are falling out. Product review: no stars."
2,If only it were readable,"The facts are there. The details are there. The battles are there. The political convolutions are there. The criminalerrors are there. I found the book unrelentingly dull, pedantic, and unengaging, even as a reference book. After slogging through about 100 pages, I gave up."
5,Very Good Read!,"This book has been a wonderful read for me. I've read several books on the Great War and ""A World Undone"" has been my favorite. I've actually read this book twice. I can't say that about very many books I've read. G.J. Meyer writes a remarkably interesting book. The book starts with a five page Chronology of the War followed by a 6 page list of the Major Characters. I found myself referring back to these references as the many battles, and characters unfolded."
4,Good read,"A well written and researched book. Captures the futility of the Great War. Pre industrial governments both republic and monarchies had no idea of the devastation that industrialized war would bring, and its lasting impact which would not be played out until the end of the second world war."
4,Great Book of History,"In high-school and college I didn't get a real glimpse of the causes of the Great War. This book does a great job of laying out that WWI was simply a perfect storm of pride, arrogance, and machismo and the whole thing was avoidable. Unfortunately, the results of WWI were a catalyst for the next one...when will we learn?"
4,"By an American, for Americans","This is a good introduction to folks with out much background on the war. It is written by an American and seems to be pointed at that audience. The author makes a great effort to provide comprehensive backgrounds about many aspects of the war, it's participants, and European history in general that most American's would not otherwise know.The book is not particularly scholarly though. There are realitvy few annotations. The author often presents an individual General's thoughts, motivation and philosophy without much supporting information. It would be nice if the author referenced letters, quotes or other documentation that support his suppositions. Otherwise, I don't know if this is conjecture or established fact. I knock a start off for this reason."
3,Not great sequel,Not as good as previous book. Found first half a little trite and not well written. The relationships were not that interesting. I would recommend this sequel only because the pace and writing really picked up in the second half when WW2 started.
4,"Good Breadth, Decent Depth","What I like about this book are the sections between each chapter that give more background on a specific person, event or situation that is relevant to what you just read in the previous chapter or are about to read in the next. It helps the reader understand more of the background behind many of the events during WWI. The book does a good job of covering the ""less"" popular fronts, especially the actions involving the armies of Austria-Hungarian empire.The details are deep enough to give the reader a good understanding without getting lost. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. It is one of the better ""global"" overview books on WWI I have read. The insight into the politically focused activities in the various capitals of the primary players in the conflict was an unexpected element of the book. In particular, the back room dealings of the diplomats and government agents in the weeks leading up to August 1st, 1914 are uniquely brought to life in this book."
5,Wonderful,Loved the poem. It was packaged really well and arrived perfect .. It arrived fast and before I needed it.
1,Didnt work as advertised,I bought it for the Lg VX8500 chocolate phone. It paired fast and easy but the sound for phone calls was really bad quality and it never worked for the MP3 player. The songs would play but no sound would come out. Stay away from this its cheap for a reason.
2,Didn't work with my Motorola Q or my wife's Chocolate,"Actually, it sort of worked with each. With my Q it would pair up fine and work great (sound quality is beyon my expectations). However, the first time you turned off the headsets you would turn them back on and instead of pairing back up with the phone it would just keep flashing, as if it was in find mode instead of pairing up. To get it to pair again I had to delete the profile from the phone and restart it.O.K., the Q has been finicky from the beginning, perhaps it wasn't the Jensen's fault. So I paired it to my wife's LG 8500 Chocolate phone. The audio from the phone came in great (clicks as you touched the controls, etc.) However, when you went to play music the volume control on the phone was stuck at 0 and wouldn't increase no matter what you do.It's a shame, because I was really looking forward to using this set. I'm sending it back and getting some headphones with good old fashioned copper wires."
4,Very good for its price,"I found this headset to be good on quality, decent on range, and alright on connectivity. I never was able to use the mic on my particular cell phone but the music headset worked perfectly. I would consider this product a good buy!"
2,its missing something...,"If your device is not bluetooth enabled, then this package wont work for you. I thought that it would come with some sort of adapter for my MP3 player, but it didnt, it was just the headphones and the chargers...so If you really want these headphones, then you need to buy the extra adapter, which costs about 30 bucks...I can't say much about the sound quality, because I havent used them, but overall they look pretty cool, and they grip onto your head, so you can move around a lot without them falling off."
1,A useless Blue tooth-ache!,"A very attractive price for stereo blue-tooth, but the device now sits an a junk drawer. I tried the headset with a T-Mobile Dash and Nokia 6030. Neither phone recognized the Headphone mode, so it can't be used for music and video. It does work in phone-only mode, however, callers complained that they could not hear me very well; the common description was that I sounded faint and far away. My advice is to use the $29 as a downpayment for a higer end unit."
2,Disappointing,"Cheap, flimsy construction and limited size adjustment (too small and uncomfortable for my ears) left me disappointed with this purchase. The sound is OK, though, and other users' mileage may vary."
3,OK value,"Not appropriate for source-device distances longer than 10 feet. Sound is acceptable at low output volume. Easy to set up. If using a iMac, after completing Bluetooth device setup to render the headphones discoverable (WBT212); note to switch the Sound options under the System Preferences:Hardware menu from internal speakers to the headphones name (WBT212)."
1,avoid this junky thing!,1. won't work as a Skype headphone/microphone with Mac2. the sound that I did get out of this thing was mono and very low-fi when used as a stereo headphone.Useless...returned it right away and got the cash back.
2,funny moments but...,the funny moments aren't enough to carry the episodes and make them a memorable show. very disappointing. everything is about singing teenagers now.
5,big time rush season one volume 2,"it was great, brand new nothing wrong with it all :Dthanks great and quick postage and can't wait fo season 2i also brought season1v.1 and it was awesome asw wellits worth it cause i couldnt find anywhere in australia to buy it :)) apart from amazonthanks heeps xx"
5,"Great Service, great BTR Video","Received promptly and in DVD faster than you can say Big Time Rush. My daughter is such a fan, thanks."
5,Favorite Singer and Song,"This album is amazing.Earl Wrightson is my favorite singer Ever,Long Before I knew you is my favorite song Ever.If there weren't other Earl Wrightson music, thiswould be my favorite album Ever.Can't decide though, All of his music is fantastic."
2,Hon,Not the best quality. Bit on the cheep side considering the cost I would have expected better quality materials. Somewhat did the job but the file folders do not slide smoothly on the rails.
1,poor info,"On your picture & description you claim there are rails for 30"" & 36"" file cabinets. But when you go to place an order, there is no place to specify which size you want!!!!"
2,Not for beginners...,"Ms.Stiles is good at Yoga but not as a yoga teacher.This DVD is not for beginners or anyone needing modfications or demonstrations of modifications. I am 61 yr old and take three Hatha yoga classes per week: I am not new to yoga. I found her instructions often hard to hear (mumbling, eating her words) with little attention to modifications. Aside from her suggesting that you take a deep breath, there was little attention to the role of the breath in relation to the movement. I felt she was too relaxed/casual in her manner: assuming that the audience was actually using proper alignment with few cues regarding possible tricks to prevent common position errors. Savasana was very brief. I gave this DVD to my daughter who is a Certified Yoga Instructor. She hasn't given me her opinion yet but it would be interesting to hear what she thinks.This is one Yoga DVD I did not find useful nor enjoyable. I am glad I did not buy it for a higher price."
4,Watch her YouTube videos too!,"I've been a long-time fan of Tara Stiles ever since I looked for yoga videos via YouTube. After finding her, I loved her style of teaching and her voice. She's very down to earth and makes yoga available for everyone, never using any sanskrit words or making it seem more complicated than it actually is. On her youtube, you can see all different sorts of videos, from ones with more challenging poses and ones for beginners.This DVD has a lot of forward folds and downward dogs, which is very nice. However, based on some of her other videos, I expected a bit more difficulty. I realize this is a video for everyone, but I would have preferred some more advanced moves. If you're just starting out with yoga, Tara is and AWESOME instructor and this is a great beginning. However, it can be boring if you're doing it for more of a workout than a relaxation practice. Nevertheless, it's great to use in the mornings to help wake up and stretch for the day."
2,Advanced Movements,"Having done yoga in the past, I thought Miss Fonda's Daily Yoga featuring Tara Stiles would be the perfect way to recapture my yoga wings. After receiving it, I watched the DVD several times, and was disappointment, realizing I'd wasted my time and money. This program (more workout than yoga) is not for me, or possibly any one who isn't limber and lightening quick to move with each stretch. I agree with the person who says it's not for beginners. I add, it's not for the average mature person wanting to begin or start over a yoga practice...it's a DVD for a young athlete, not older adults, even those of us who can double the session of her two dvds, Prime time's Walkout and Fitness and still have energy for yoga. Jane, ""Bring it to us from your level. That's what we are expecting from your exercise/yoga programs at this time in our lives, yours and mine"". If you fit Jane Fonda's profile, give or take 20 years, save your money on this one. Susan"
5,Great Yoga Instructor.,This DVD of Tara Stiles is a fabulous workout. It really makes me feel great and relaxed. Tara knows how to teach yoga very well.
3,Jane Fonda's Workout Daily Yoga with Tara Stiles,"Too difficult for a beginner. Need some guidance in description of tape. I do not recommend for beginners at all, Too difficult."
4,"Not a Beginner Product, But Excellent Nonetheless","I am an at-home yoga DVD junkie. I bought this fairly yearly on in my ""practice"" and found it difficult, but as time wears on it has become a regular in the rotation. If this is your first foray into the yoga DVD hold off on this one, but definitely pick it up for your larger collection."
1,Did not like,"I have been doing yoga for 25+ years. I enjoy Bryan Kest, Tamal Dodge, Travis Eliot, Rodney Yee, and many others -female and male. I just did not enjoy the instruction or any of this dvd."
2,5.1 my a@@,"i set this up on a computer for my daughter and did not know what to expect, so i tested the indivual speakers tested front right it played however the same sound came through all the other speakers just softer like an echo. Quality of sound is poor the thing sounds like i got crickets trapped in there. Then again you get what you pay for. still i expected desent quality sound just not a high volume was i wrong. the spekers that came with most computers is just as good as this one"
1,My dog and house are infested with fleas,"I used Frontline earlier this summer on both of my dogs and we saw zero fleas or ticks. I switched to Bio-spot to save money. The older dog got the last dose of Frontline, and the other dog got the new cheaper Bio-Spot treatment. Two weeks after applying it, the Bio-Spot dog started getting really red and itchy. I soon discovered fleas all over the chair and his bedding. The other dog, still no fleas. So I will be forking over the money for Frontline from now on. In the long run I think it will save me money on foggers and carpet spray, and I think my dog will be pretty happy not to have to suffer again like he is now. Don't buy this stuff!"
2,Switching Products,We used this product in the past and have had good results. This summer we were slack in keeping up the flea treatments and our dog decided he wanted some firends to carry around with him. We bought a 6 month supply and have used up 5 months of it in the past 2 months and he still has fleas. In addition to using this product we pick the fleas off and have sprayed our house numerous times. We have also washed all his bedding and blankets. The number of fleas are less but they are still there.
4,Great collection!,"Wow Uematsu is just great! This album has some great pieces like tenderness in the air, lenna's theme, a presentiment, ahead on our way and music box. Brings back great memories when i use to play the game often! Great album if you like Uematsu's music and the game itself."
4,Why hasn't anyone else done a revieuw on this!?,"I'm big fan of Nobou Uematsu, as alot of you out there are, cos let face it, the man is a genius! This cd is just another example of his brilliance, very nicely done, especially if you've played the game, if not, you'll still like it, cos it has the Final Fantasy Feel to it, wich al;ways makes for some nice music. Fav track is the Prologue, wich is just beautiful! i loved this track since the first time i heard it in midi form, but played on a piano is just fantastic! you have to get this if!"
4,Jo Stafford not my favorite singer,"This is an excellent collection by Jo Stafford, but after listening I see she is not my favorite singer. I do like this for the wide variety of songs though."
5,"Works, easy to use","Software is easy to use. Plug it in, connect and download data from the weather station. Just what I needed!"
2,Works but clunky software,It works but the software seems like a visual basic program. If you want to upload data from your ADC you need it. It'sway overpriced for what you get. Not up to the ADC quality.
2,Necessary but flawed,"If you want to get the logs off your ADC weather station, you need this dongle, since the ADC weather station does not support IrDA. Go figure. Also, there are no drivers for 64-bit Windows, which is annoying. The software supplied works, but it is certainly not top notch."
1,Discomfort....,"This item did make me sweat and I noticed I had better posture, but no matter how much I washed it, it retained an unpleasant odor. Also, by the 3rd day, I broke out in an itchy rash. I tried wearing it over an old t-shirt, to avoid direct contact with the skin, but it didn't matter. I stopped using it, so I don't know if it does what it claims."
1,Everlast fro her slimmer belt,I ordered the Ever last for her slimmer belt with zippers and got a completely different belt that I will never use. The item received has Velcro and not what was pictured. I will never use what I purchased and will never again order anything from your website since the picture and not a good description of what was received.
5,Well worth it.,"Both myself and my wife work out everyday, I bought my first belt when I was in the States two years ago, and now looking to buy a second one for my wife. Not being able to get out there on the road to run we have got a crosstrainer in the house, both of us use it weveryday whilst wearing our belts, The belt is secure and does not move, the extra heat generated by the belt helps to loose the extra fluid stored around that area. As mentioned in the previous reviews it helps with posture, It helps you to maintain the correct position whilst working out, stopping that sore back. We will continue to use ours and recomend it."
3,good product,"I expected it'll have more zippers, so I can adjust it when I loose weight. It should be identified with a size."
2,very disapointed,"not so good .it say fit all size. not true, well it din't fit me!!! it's too big i have't be able to use it.very disapointed not wat i spected. the only way you can bay this it is if you are abaut 200bl. im 145bl and is very big;-["
1,"Curious, don't waste your time/money!","I exercise a lot so this didn't look to bad to me, no outlets or batteries and not much hassle to put on before a run. Dang this item sucks! It rolls up and won't fit properly no matter how many times you adjust it! It at least helps you sweat, thats what its meant to do but the 'magnets' in the back don't do anything. Just find one with a temp control and is portable, I've found those are much better even if they do take more time to put on."
3,only 3 zippers,"I thought I was getting a five zipper belt and I got only three, whats up with that? I needed the five zipper, now what do I do? The picture shows five zippers."
3,A bit slow,Not bad but not all that exciting either. Took me watching it twice to catch all the nuiances of the story. Maybe it was just me....
4,its a good movie,i like the move because Bradley Cooper is in it and i think he is a realy good actor and the movie has a good story line and draws the veiwer in
1,It contains only 13 pages of information plus appendices,This book is not what I expected. The total authors contribution runs to only 13 pages (Chapter 1 to end). The remainder is reprints of other companies proposals to raise money. This would certainly not be my first choice of book to recommend to anyone.
1,Truly awful,This disgusting book condones a bizarre sexual practice and as such should be banned. I find it very hard to believe anyone would be interested in this book. Sick.
1,Where's the beans?!?,"I ordered the 108-count, 16oz package of beans, and what I received weighed 2 ounces and had maybe 14 beans inside. Maybe this was a labelling error? I have no idea, but it's annoying in any case, and I will be returning the product for a refund."
1,GARBAGE PAIN AND SIMPLE!!!!,SPEND YOUR MONEY on a NON-REVERSIBLE! I will NEVER buy another reversible. I thought that Tommy may produce a better belt... no different then the Walmart versions.
5,Crazy Awesome,"These are totally cool cartoons. They have a pretty unique storyline told in a great visual style. I actually got them without ever seeing it on TV before but I liked Genndy Tartakovsky's ""Clone Wars"" series. This is a crazy awesome series."
5,My best Option,"i am restoring a Ford Mustang 1986, and After deep analysis of alternatives, this is the best for my car."
1,Interesting,"I ordered all the flavors except the original, and I didn't care for these at all...nor did a few of my friends. They have an odd taste. I thought the coolness of the mint would marry nicely with the heat of the ginger, but I was wrong. They just taste weird. All three of us ended up spitting them out...couldn't even finish chewing them. Very disappointing."
5,Sun Spots Do Go Away!,"I have tried several (and more expensive) well-know bleach creams to get rid of skin discoloration and age spots. This Vita K product is described only for the hand spots, but I decided to give it a try on my face.Incredibly, I noticed a difference after the first time of us. In a couple of weeks it not only faded my discolorations, it evened my olive skin about a shade lighter, giving it a glowing look. The difference is noticeably enough to get compliments that I look ""rested,"" not that I have done anything else to my face.Since this product is designed for the hands, I only recommend this for rougher and darker skin tones. If you decide to use it just do a small patch test on your face to see if your skin has any reaction other than the expected one. You will be amazed and pleased with the results."
5,Vita-K Solution Works,"With daily washing (morning & evening) and application of Vita-K Solution your skin will be smoother and more vibrant. It does fade sun spots, but they so not disappear completely.My daughter used it just as a moisturizer and it cleared up her acne, which was an added plus."
3,not as comfortable as the side chair version,"I bought the office guest chair from this line a couple years ago and liked it. This one is not as comfortable. I wish I had gotten a much cheaper chair I saw a Costco.The leather cover is dull and plastic looking.The hard plastic arms are quite comfortable, though."
5,Great book,This book was great. Very enjoyable. I have many friends that are leap day babies involved with The Quadrennial Council and they all loved it also. [..]
3,Good but not so deep,"First I want to say that the CD I recieved was cover with scratches. When I emailed the customer service they sent me a new Cd, but...It was cover with scratches again! Anyway it was possible to see the film.I think the film touch only the surface of the things. The problem may be the want of the film maker to touch to many kind of martial arts. Maybe a focus on 2 or 3 of the martial art was enough. I find the DVD nice but a bit shallow."
3,good basic book,"As an avid crafter who buys lots of craft books, this one did not stand out hugely as being brilliant, but having said that, there were a couple of projects that I will be trying out, for example the herb flowerpots and also I just loved the jingle bell snowman! This book would be very good for a beginner who wanted to try lots of different things."
5,Look No Further Than Rozalla,"This is an excellent pop and dance album. There are many great tracks on this one - I Love Music, Free The Love, Do You Believe and many more. There's something here for everyone!"
2,didn't function properly right from the package,"The cartridge was too tightly packed to let the air through. I had to pry it open and re pack it, then glue it back together. The pump is the loudest I have ever used."
1,Loud and Broken,"We got this for my daughter's goldfish bowl two months ago. The air pump is so loud we can hear it everywhere in the house. One thing that isn't listed in the product description is this little carbon ball that connects to the tubing and weights the entire piece down. As it has worn down, the air pump works harder and harder. Now the carbon ball is worn down enough that it won't connect to the tubing at all. I covered the bottom of the filter with rocks but without the carbon ball weighing it down the whole thing just floats around. Hagen doesn't seem to offer a replacement for this carbon ball, so it seems this filter kit is now garbage."
2,"Great DVD, poor quality equipment","I bought ""Cardio Hoop"" yesterday, along with the Ultra Hoop to add to my routine. Being that this was my first Hoop experience, I was looking for something very basic and easy to follow; I found ""Cardio Hoop"" to be just the thing. I liked that Kamala Mathis explained each move before starting or moving to the next, and that each step was repeated enough times to get the hang of it without having to pause, practice, rewind.I just wish I were equally satisfied with the Ultra Hoop. I initially loved this product because it's large and weighted, so I really had to work the core and lower body to get the thing moving. Having said that however, the hoop kept falling apart during the workout and eventually broke just as I was starting to feel the burn.I'm returning the Ultra Hoop, but keeping the ""Cardio Hoop"" DVD with hopes of finding a better quality hoop."
2,Hoop is impossible to put together.,"I'm giving this two stars because Kamala is fun to watch. However, I cannot do the workout with her because this hoop keeps falling apart. I have tried to put it together for the past 30 mins and still can't get it to stay in one piece while I do the moves. Having the hoop falling apart all over the place could be dangerous - especially if someone else was in the room to witness this fiasco.Save your money for a better quality product."
1,Total waste of money!,This hoop is a total waste of money! Didn't even get it around twice before it fell apart. The connectors are plastic tubes and when you piece it together it is hard to get it into a perfect circle. My daughter had the same problem with it coming apart when she used it. I think this product would be better if it came as one solid piece.
4,A must for tank development study!,"von Senger und Etterlin accomplish what many writers set out to do when they take on the task of examining German armour, but this book is one of the VERY few that succeeds in accurately depicting the devopment of the German armoured technology. From the armoured cars and prototypes of 1926 to the super-heavies of 1945 and the futuristic follies, this book says it all. If you`re looking for accuracy, detail, and loads of photos, diagrams, blueprints, etc., then this is your answer."
4,Relaxing,This cd is exactly what it says it is. Meditaion for busy people. It really taught me to slow down and take some time for my self. In only about 20 minutes a day to relive stress.
2,It is not babaganouge.,"Cans are labeled as a babaganouge but it is more like hummus. I think they are mislabeled. If you wanted hummus they are OK. You can add some olive oil, garlic and lemon juice ending with a decent hummus."
4,Baba Ghanouge,This is a very good eggplant dip. I am from the middle east and we make this at home. It is so close to home made. the only thing I like to add to this is a little more Garlic and it is perfect.Spread on pitta bread and enjoy.
4,Tasty and Healthy,"This is a really good dip for vegetables and pita. The only ingredients are eggplant, tahini paste, and salt, so it is pretty natural and basic. I took it to work and popped the can, which is highly convenient for travel since you don't need an opener. It tasted fine, but kind of bland. There's a bit of a smoky flavor. I mixed in some olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic like the can says to do (if I only I would read directions first) and its really good. I agree from the other reviewer that the consisency is quite think like hummus, but it is not made out of chickpeas. It isn't the same as the babaganoush I get at restaurants, but it is still good for a can product. I'm a big fan of eggplant if made properly. You also get alot for the price, I can make four meals out of this. I will definately buy again. I also bought the hummus from Alwadi."
2,Eggplant Hummus,"This has the texture and the looks of hummus.It is made of eggplant, but this is not Baba Ghannouge.I've had Baba Ghannouge from Alwadi Al Akhdar and Cortas before.This is eggplant hummus."
3,This book is really outdated. Not the fault of the seller.,"The book was probably top notch information when it was written and for some years afterward. However, the changes that have taken place in this country politically, culturally, geographically, and infra structurally render this book anemic in it's treatment of the subject."
1,Wickman's disrespect for Osceola'a legacy,"I wanted to request a refund on the amount of money that had been wasted on this terrible piece of writing, but it was much more fun to use the book in building a fire. Wickman's research was padantic; obsessively detailed. However, there was no linear (or other) thinking involved in the final synthesis. In fact, having read the same research literature as Dr. Wickman had poured through, it is amazing to me that someone could write so many pages that are comprehensible only to people who have actually read the same research literature. Her writing evokes a rememberance of a criticism of Henry James (slightly reworded): ""This author (not a writer) fills a much needed void."" Let us pray that the Seminole Tribe of Florida will soon experience a void that once was occupied by this author. Osceola was a great War Chief, and a very interesting individual. Wickman's work does great injustice to both legacies."
5,Loaded with information & fabulous photographs,"I went through this book the very minute I received it, front to back cover. The numerous large color photographs were impressive and the information the book contained on the artist, the dolls, the variations, the clothes, and the other Playpal Family dolls gave me a well-rounded education, along with the other Patti Playpal book, called Patti Playpal Family. I am not disappointed that I splurged on them both. There was much information in the Art of... that was not in the other and yet the other contained some information that the Art of... didn't. A must for Patti Playpal lovers - both books."
1,Not happy,This may work with some phones - however - it did not work form mine - very disappointed. Quick shipping. Please note not all phones will work with non OEM cable.
1,"NOT A HOTSYNC CABLE, CHARGES ONLY","WARNING This is NOT as advertised, it is NOT a hotsync cable. There is NO hotsync button, it only charges your Palm. Misrepresentation, which is why they are charging so little."
3,Dutch,"This book came out in the early 80's and has short chapters on artists important for the development of rhythm & blues like Cab Calloway, Ruth Brown, Lionel Hampton and of course Louis Jordan.It's in Dutch, has many pictures and maybe a few too many names, but it's full of usable information."
3,Not exactly what I expected....,"... Not exactly - please be sure to understand this is an article written by the authors and published in the July-August 1998 Harvard Business Review magazine. The article, sans cover pages, is really only 10 pages long. It does indeed highlight some of the points of the book, from what I can tell without having read the book."
4,Solid Experience Economy Introduction,"Solid introduction to the Experience Economy as elucidated by Pine & Gilmore. At it's core, Experience Economy is an elegant concept and this introduction does well at explaining it. Samuel R Daines II."
3,Almost fluid,"3 1/2Solo Jazz piano from the Spanish composer certainly deals in masterful strokes, though has trouble making all-encompassing songs with much of the scatter-shot compositional technique, and while rough around the edges, there certainly remains enough melodic bite to warrant examination."
2,This CD is painful to listen to nowadays.,"Maybe I'm getting old now, but it seems beyond my capacity to understand how anyone could hear this CD and give it five out of five stars. No, it's not awful, it's even pretty good, but that's it. There is something clearly missing here that is not missing on _Hang Time_ and _. . . And the Horse They Rode in on_. I think it has a great deal to do with how you feel after listening to the album all the way through. This offering just doesn't draw you in quite the way the other two do. It doesn't seem as honest, or as open. It just gets to be tedious. I have really, really tried to enjoy this new ""one-hit wonder"" version of Soul Asylum, but I give up. I'm going to go put in _Tim_ and think of the good old days of Minneapolis rock (excluding the short-purple-guy-with-a-symbol-for-a-name-- although, to be fair, he used to be pretty damn cool, too)."
3,Dopey Lyrics Mar Some Great Tunes,"Sonically, ""Let Your Dim Light Shine,"" is every bit as good as Soul Asylum's breakthrough smash ""Grave Dancer's Union,"" even if it doesn't contain a smash hit like the way-overplayed ""Runaway Train."" Unfortunately, some of the best songs here suffer from lyrics that are either laughable or offensive. The catchy single ""Misery"" is saddled with the baffling refrain ""frustrated, incorporated,"" while ""String of Pearls"" has bizarre references such as the one to a a two-headed President. But the low point comes with the reference to a six-year-old hooker in the song ""Eyes of a Child,"" which, frustratingly(!), contains the album's prettiest melody.Overall, this is a self-sabotaged follow up to a popular breakthrough album that helped to hasten Soul Asylum's rapid return to their previous obscurity."
3,"Eh, it's no Grave Dancer's Union","This album is fine. I'm a Soul Asylum fan, and I bought this for less than 3 dollars, including S&H. There are a few songs that a good on here, most notably ""Misery"", but the others sort of fade into obscurity. I have no idea why Butch Vig even produced this, you don't hear any of the layering that we got on Nirvana's ""Nevermind"". Even so, if you're a fan, buy the album. But buyer beware."
4,Good Book,"I just bought and completed this book last night. It was pretty good. The ending was both happy and sad, considering that it was talking about the Black Hawk War in which, if your pro-American Indian like me, there is no happy ending in this story. However, the growing bond between Black Hawk's grandson and the main character's family is powerful."
5,A must for any couple!,"Dr. Ruth Westheimer is probably THE best known person today when it comes to knowledge about sex. She's down to earth, funny, and helps you feel that YOU TOO can have success if you just try, explore, and trust in yourself. She brings the same attitude to this book about keeping relationships alive, and it works wonderfully.The book is full of easy to understand, easy to implement, practical advice. There are sections on how to argue less often ... ideas on introducing Romance to your lives ... renewing the respect you have for each other ... how to feel attractive and worthy ... and much, much more.Simple graphics point out where they key tips are, and real-life examples help explain how some 'theories' would work in your relationship. It discusses difficult situations and solutions to them. It helps you plan romantic getaways, and even lists websites for you to visit!Highly recommended for anyone wanting to add a little more interest into their relationship."
4,Honey is reading it too!!!,"Easy to read, very informative. We'll see if it makes a difference in our relationship. Since I keep it in the bathroom my sweetheart started to page through it as well."
1,Garmin iQue M5 ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector,This is a most useless product and I regret buying it. The touch screen on Garmin products is designed to outlast your desire to keep them. This renders such products as this unnecessary. I didn't realize that the screen protectors would glue themselves to the touch screen so opted not to use them at all. I can't envision a circumstance where I would ever use them.
5,Now I like it,I whisked eggs in a flat bottom glass pot and it was the fastest easiest and most pleasant egg beating experience. I bought this more from reading a Kurt Anderson article on kitchen equipment and watching Sara's Secret than from any recognition that this whisk would be useful. It's flexible and beautiful to look at and it has a cool handle as if I am stirring up a concoction whilst in an Azzedine Alaia. I recommend this product. I don't regret choosing the longest length but it does flip off when I try to prop the handle against something.
4,Great Pictures.,"Gee- if I only had a million dollars! No, really 10-20-30 million. Anyway some beautiful boats, interiors etc The Hinckley tradition. These guys should make a beautiful coffee table book in large format. The color pictures are glorious but not enough. Gee I've never talked about pictures before- just guess I'm in love or is it LUST. OK- this books best sections are on interior and exterior maintenance- how to do it the right way! They also take on mechanical, electrical, rigging etc. But for practical information here go to NIGEL CALDER. If you'd like your boat to shine like a Hinckley, or just want to know the right way to do things, what works, what doesn't. This is the book for you. I bought it for ideas in redoing my interior, but am happy with the whole book. Would I buy it again. Even though a little pricey- YES."
5,Sony Vegas 6 reviewed at Microfilmmaker.com,"""...Unless you only own a Mac, Vegas 6 should definitely be a consideration for any microfilmmaker out there. If nothing else, you owe it to yourself to download a demo from Sony's site and see if it's able to do what you need to do. Just remember to give yourself at least a week to get used to it's unique cadence, especially if you've had lots of experience with other editing programs..."" -Jeremy Hanke, Microfilmmaker.com"
1,"My sincerest apologies, but ...","I have to admit that listening to Ms. Barlow (I've heard her speak to our management team) makes far more sense than her book, and I've had the opportunity to chat with her about what I felt the shortcomings to this text were. While she agreed, she insisted that the book stood up to criticism on its own merits, and, while she agreed that her thinking might be a bit dated, she felt 'barefoot and pregnant' was still a relevant topic for the workplace. I can't 'disrecommend' this book strong enough."
1,I think there are laws against this kind of thing.,"I was recommended at a seminar of Ms. Barlowe's to read her book, and I have to say that it is the finest example of plagiarism committed that I've come across to date. You would think that the editors would've checked into the facts, theories, etc., explored in this work, but apparently intellectual property is dead."
1,Utter tripe.,"Useless drivel by a terribly dated author who supports empowerment of only women in the workplace. Is this author living in the Dark Ages with the roles reversed? It's interesting to note that the two endorsements are also noted in the book as ""paid"" contributors. Don't waste your time."
1,Uh ... Are We Still Living in the Stone Age here?,"THE POSSIBLE WOMAN makes light of every achievement womankind has made, every stride they've accomplished, and every benchmark they've acheived in the last fifty years. It's premise is ridiculous, and I can only hope that the publisher doesn't offer the author a follow-up. On the upside, it might serve as the foundation for a great sitcom on the WB Network. Ha!"
3,Not bad...,"""My Favorite Thief"" started out so strong and so entertaining that I was sure I had a keeper...what a disappointment. First of all, this was Harrison's book. I LOVED him. He was well developed and sexy as hell. As for Charlotte, well..she seemed rather flat to me. But her lack of character is not what kept this story from being great. It was that there were so few scenes with the h/h interacting. I felt like they barely knew eachother. The fact that they had so little time together throughout the book made their mutual declaration of love ring false...I felt no chemistry at all... All in all, this wasn't awful, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it either..."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"If you enjoyed reading"" Once a Warrior"", ""The Witch and the Warrior"", and ""The Rose and the Warrior"", as I did, you'll be sadly disappointed by this convoluted and unfeeling story, and seriously wonder how the same writer could write this book. Although Harrison was a good character; strong, manly, and self-assured, as well as an accomplished thief, Charlotte on the other hand, was so low key and flat it was difficult to get a sense of her as a person, and the return of her father really threw the book off balance. Add in a ton of London's low life spewing their words of wisdom, as well as whores, murderer's, and everything else you can think of, and you've got the story of the book."
4,The Reality of Corporate Superficiality!,"This book brings to light an unspoken mood, an unspoken, taboo feeling, constantly existing between individual black professionals and corporate masses in America. Simultaneously serious, thought provoking and funny, it will touch a nerve with all black Americans pushing against the glass ceiling of corporate America. Great gift idea!"
3,Too much CIA...not enought NUMA,Another Dirk Pitt novel under Cussler's belt. Not a bad read if you're looking for international espionage mixed with underwater marine thriller. Cussler tries his hand at a Clancy type story. That took away from the vintage Dirk Pitt plot. The story was interesting but not the usual NUMA adventure concentrating on our main heroes.
3,A fine book but anti-Japanese sentiment throughout,"This was a great read - typical edge of the seat Pitt adventure although a bit difficult to swallow some of the scenarios. Is there nobody else on the planet that can save the world other than Dirk Pitt :-) The one thing that spoilt the enjoyment of this book (hence the 3 star rating rather than the 5 it deserved) was the undisguised anti-Japanese message that was prevalent throughout the entire book. It seemed to go just a little beyond the necessary for making a good crook and although it is stated in a few places that Suma and co. were in it without the backing of the Japanese people and government, it was disconcerting to see much fairly unpleasant criticism of Japanese business practices."
5,You wanna pack your stuff and visit the moose.,This excellent work makes you learn about the biggest antler in a entertaining way. The pictures are stunning.I recommend this book to anyone having a soft spot for the moose and to those wanting to understand the wildlife they share space with during a vacation up north!
5,What It Feels Like to Be Madonna,"Academic scholars and fans will eat up this book of popular articles and critical essays on the queen of pop music. Anyone interested on the phenomenon of ""Madonna"" should definitely read this. This book provides valuable insight on her career, artistry and impact on on society, (whether you care to admit it or not.) Feminists, gays and lesbians should take note, there is plenty of material here to generate tons of debate on Madonnna's impact for years to come. A VERY VALUABLE AND FAIRLY RECENT RESOURCE!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Stand out for safety sake,"I LOVE this product. It's well made, versatile to use and VERY noticeable. I'm a new female motorcycle rider and I was looking for something to help other drivers see me. I wear this over my leather jacket or my backpack and it's does the job perfectly. My friends who rides behind me says this helps me stand out from all the surrounding traffic. I feel 1000 times safer with this on."
5,Bought a Second One For My Husband,I bought this for cycling on roads because I think drivers probably recognize the triangle symbol even better than small blinking lights. The triangle is very reflective and comfortable to wear. I have worn it on very hot days and stayed comfortable. I bought a second for my husband because he recently began cycling.
5,LOOK AT ME NOW,"Drivers who see this Reflective Yield Symbol will give you additional space on the road; bike lane or not. I have noted drivers clearing the area around the far right (bike) lane since I strapped this triangular symbol around my backback. I have all sorts of safety devices includingRadians SV6OL Class 2 Two Tone Surveyor Safety Vests, Solid Mesh Orange, LargeFlashflight SpokeLit Disc-O,Bell iPulse LED Bike Torchand helmet - but the TRIANGLE is highly reflective and triggers drivers' TO MOVE or CLEAR the space which is preferred while I ride 22 miles back and forth to work every day on the bicycle. I am going to buy another one just because I like to have two of EVERYTHING, especially when it comes to safety."
4,Jogalite reflective yield Symbol,I ride a tadpole trike and wanted to be safe in traffic. I put this on the back of my seat and I think it helps.
3,little disappointed,"I was really pleased with the size of this bread box, I have a big family so we use a lot of bread the problem is that the door comes off to easily. Maybe it is this particular bread box but the hinges come undone way too easily and the door slides off. I do not have it over loaded and I feel that it should be made more sturdy to keep the door on. It otherwise is a great size and is attractive."
4,"consider the matte finish, and say a prayer during shipping","The design of this product is great; I love how you can mount it on the wall and sit items on top of it. The shiny aluminum finish, however, reflects a lot of glare in a bright room, and makes every smudge/scratch/dent stand out like a sore thumb. Unfortunately, ours arrived already dented. (Double-boxed, but with no padding inside or between the boxes.) I still want one, but since I have to return this one anyway, I'm replacing it with the matte finish version that's available (through Amazon or not) from [...]."
5,bread box,I was very pleased with the bread box. It was a little longer than I expected and not quite as high. The one I have at my other house is an antique and has a shelf in the middle so I kind of expected this one to be the same. It is doing the job I purchased it for.
3,Does the Job,It keeps my bread fresh for a long time. It keeps about 3 loaves a bread in at a time. Although this bread box is flimsyand too light weight for the price!!
5,preformance and function; great purchase,"this is the third bread box i have owned and the best in terms of practicality and potential life expectancy. while the price made me pause, the stainless construction sealed the deal. it is a great little item that will grace our counter next to the toaster for many years."
3,Almost a five,"there was a small ding in the top of the bread box, it was in three boxes so I guess the ding came from the factory."
5,Very nice for the price,I purchased this because I wanted a breadbox with a drop down front that was not too wide. It fit both trequirements and is of good grade metal and maintains its finish well. I would recommend it.
4,Nice breadbox,"I really like this breadbox. It seems to keep the bread fresher, longer. It slides on the counter top so I put a rubber shelf liner under it. If you have kids it will probably get scratched due to the brilliant chrome finish."
1,a terrible book for starters,"the book is more of a manual than a comprehensive textbook. It is not at all a good book from which to learn the topic. Most of the math is half explained, numerous step jumps, etc. The author seems to have assumed a level of math mastery equivalent to Gauss, Lagrange etc. on the part of the readers. All in all, I would definitely not recommend this book for anyone that wants to really learn the subject. As a graduate student, I have found the book thorny and exceedingly frustrating to read from. Some of the better books are Hull, Kirk."
2,Difficult to follow,This book is clearly written by an expert for an expert. It may be a good reference for those familiar with the material who simply need a reference. For students interested in learning the material it is presented at a very high level which is difficult to follow.
4,Best and Unbiased in Study Bibles,"Please see my NASB review of the Thompson for all its features, advantages and disadvantages. Why 4 stars, and not 5? Kirkbride has cheapened its Bibles since I bought my first, the KJV 1964 edition. The pages are not as well-attached, the paper is much slicker and thinner--in short, more like Nelson and World Bibles. My old KJV Thompson has gone through thick and thin for many years and I'm not sure about these newer, cheaper ones. I notice Kirkbride is having these printed up in Korea now, also, and the type, particularly on the NASB, is not of the quality of the older ones, either. But then, what nowadays is better made? It'd probably cost at least twice the price of this Bible to make it the old way. Plus, this in no way negates the superb layout and 'neutrality' of this study Bible. If you want NKJV, this is the one!"
3,This is very tiny!,"I thought this would be large enough for my son to play with, but it's a model-type ship you would put up on a shelf, not a toy."
4,PUPPY CHOW,"my puppy likes this food but when she got bored with it and ate little, i mixed it with other dry food and now she devours it!"
3,Untimely Delivery,"Very disappointed how long it took for the product to arrive from when it was ordered. We had to go and purchase the item locally as we could not wait for the product to arrive. Won't be ordering puppy food from Amazon anymore. Order placed April 16, 2012 and did not arrive until April 30, 2012. So much for the Amazon statement of your order will arrive in 5-7 days."
4,Very nice,"Easy to assemble, and looks very nice. Darker than pictured. Very petite and fits perfectly. Tapestry cloth seat cover is attractive. Edge slightly damaged in shipping, but does not detract from overall satisfaction."
1,You gotta be kidding me !!!,"There is know way the company that made and packaged this product didnt know it was damaged when being packed, the box was in perfect condition when we opened it on Xmas day, After putting it all together, we noticed, 1) a big chunk of the fake wood busted right in the front and someone already had attempted to fit it, 2) 1 leg is about a 1/4 inch shorter then the other 3 legs, 3) the mirror was a completely different stain color, I always buy on Amazon but now I will be cautious in doing so. There is no way to package this piece of crap back up and ship it, I guess we will have to get someone to fix it. AMAZON, please get my daughter a REFUND. Thanks Mike"
4,Customer Service at Werfurniture has been awesome.,"Customer Service at Werfurniture has been awesome. Although I haven't received the vanity set yet (this is the second one that I am ordering), the customer service provided at Werfurniture has been terrific. There was some confusion as to which address my order should ship to and everything was straightened out in minutes!!!!!! Way to go Grace Liu.CHERRY FINISH WOOD VANITY SET - TABLE WITH MIRROR AND BENCH"
4,"Very nice for a 1/8"" mat","This mat is only of standard thickness (1/8""), but it is the best 1/8"" mat I have ever tried!The last 1/8"" mat I had barely protected me from the floor; this one has a memory-foam-like quality, and really does a good job of cushioning me in comparison to the Hugger Mugger one I had last time.While a 1/4"" might be squishier, this is a really very good 1/8"" mat, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality...."
3,Slippery when wet,"I use this mat mainly for yoga, but every once in a while I also use it for P90X, which is heavy duty.I break into a sweaty mess 10 minutes into the workout, and the mat loses all of its stickiness, causing me to have to correct my pose every 15 seconds because my feet spin and slip out of control. Of course, this is a major inconvenience.So, if you sweat more than the average guy or girl, consider getting another mat. This one is otherwise very fine."
3,Ok for the price,"I'm not a super fitness buff and this is the first yoga mat I bought. I only use it at home and not very frequently. It serves its purpose well--it provides enough cushion and stays put on the floor. My only complaint is that if my hands or feet get even a little bit sweaty, they slip all over the mat so I've had to put a towel down and then it works fine. All-in-all I'd say it's good for the price, especially if you're just starting out and just want to get something to try for a while."
5,Smells divine!,"I wear this oil with the Nubian Heritage Chai and Goats Milk Shea butter and lotion. They smell very simular.Soft, sweet and creamy."
4,I need a response from the Author,"Hi, I love the book! But the cold cream recipe and the rose cream recipes have obvious errors in the quantities of ingredients. Example. The cold cream says it makes 7 ounces....then it says to use 12 ounces of beeswax and so on.....12 ounces of beeswax and the other ingredients do not shrink down to make 7 ouncyues. I tried it and made a big mess. I then tried just 2 ounces of beeswax and it was perfect. I need a response back from the author if anyone can help me. I really need to know now about the rose cream. I botched it up 5 times! with the directions given, but it's the only rose cream I could find anywhere."
1,Awful product!,"This lamp *looks* pretty ... but that's about it. It's so poorly designed & constructed, I couldn't even put it together. Where the arms are supposed to join, you have to turn a thumscrew into the two halves of the join. But the wire going through the arms is too big to thread through the joints -- so you can't get the two halves to come together fully, thus the teeth don't mesh. And even if you can put it together, it's not fully adjustable like the description claims. When you assemble the arms, you have to essentially lock them into place -- the only way to adjust them is to un-clamp them and re-assemble them, which is totally impractical and inconvenient. I'm sending mine back."
2,Disjointed and Abrasive,"I found Opincar's writing style to be very disjointed and abrasive. While the content was brutally honest, I found it mostly uninteresting and vague. Opincar is not a man I would ever want to encounter in this lifetime.Putting my dislike for the author's personality aside, this was a fast, easy read and on occasion contained small morsels of fascinating food facts and history."
5,Ever been a sysop? You MUST have this DVD set.,"If you were ever a sysop or ever spent much time using a BBS, you must have this DVD set. It's fantastic."
5,You really should buy this DVD,"Part of the BBS Scene all those years ago? Buy this DVD.Don't know what BBS means? Buy this DVD!It looks to be a fascinating story, and the first (and maybe last!) true documentary about the BBS scene.BUY THIS DVD!"
2,Some examples won't work with the included software!,"I certainly expected the software to be a reduced feature version of the Visual Studio IDE. However, Microsoft crippled it so much that even some very basic functionality has been removed. In fact, some of the code in the INCLUDED book won't work! For example, you can't even create .DLL files with the included version of the IDE."
1,"THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY, DON'T BUY THE BOOK !","This obsolete edition of the Step by step book isn't worth what u might pay for it... The package contains the step-by-step book, Examples (included with the step-by-step book also) and Visual C# .Net standard edition. If u already have got Visual C# or Visual Studio .Net then DON'T BUY THAT BOOK .... U can get the book and the examples CD ... from Amazon ... Don't waste ur money on a bunch of useless CDs."
3,Of course this book doesnt teach C++!,"I recently read another review for this book on this page and the author of the review complained how the book does not teach C++. Well I would like him to know that of course it doesnt... the title of the book is Microsoft Visual C# .NET Deluxe Learning Edition, therefore it teaches C#!"
3,Fine for the price,"Highly portable, but out of the box the wheel was off six inches per fifty foot. The wheel works fine for the price but don't expect pinpoint accuracy."
1,Inaccurate,"Against my better judgment, I picked this up at Walmart for about $25. Going over short distances (10 feet) indoors, I noticed that measurements differed by 2 to 3 inches depending on whether I pushed the wheel forwards or flipped it over backwards and pulled the wheel. So I laid out a tape measure for 15 feet. Going forward for the precisely-measured 15 feet, the reading was 13 feet, 11 inches. Measuring the same distance using the other method, it came out to 14 feet, 2 inches. So it seems to be consistently off by 6 to 7 percent. For my purposes, this tool is pretty much worthless.Back in the day, the Stanley logo meant you purchased a well-made tool. Now, I guess, it means you got a cheaply-made, unreliable tool at a place like Walmart."
3,Good disc but missing the Jonathan Peter's Radio Mix,"This is a good disc to hear interesting variations of ""My Love Is Your Love."" The Wyclef Remix is an especially nice version. The two dance tracks, Thunderpuss 2000 Club Mix and the Jonathan Peters' Vocal Club Mix, are have a good sound and are long, with varying speed instrumental interludes. I was hoping that one of the cuts on this disc would be the version from the radio - dance, peppy, and clubby, but without the long instrumental interludes - but it was not included on this disc. That version is called the Jonathan Peter's Radio Mix."
3,"Good Originals, Bad Remixes","I love Whitney Houston, and I think that 'My Love is Your Love, and 'It's Not Right But It's Okay' are definitely two of her better songs, but I was disappointed in the remixes. I hate to say this because I'm such a big fan but the Jonathan Peters' Remix bordered on awful! But I still love the original versions of the songs, and I love Whitney, so this import was acceptable."
1,Arrived already sealed closed,"These envelopes arrived already sealed closed - every single one of them! To use them, I tried to open them carefully, but almost every one of them tore and was unusable. I advise everyone NOT to buy these."
