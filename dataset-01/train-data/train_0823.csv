3,Dreadful customer service,"HP Officejet 4215 TWO DOAs in a row!! The second one not so surprising because, as I found out, they replace DOAs with reconditioned used machines. Half a week crawling round on the floor unplugging cables and plugging them in again while on hold to helpdesks in Bangalore to HP, who said it was a Dell problem, so on phone to them for a couple of hours too, turns out not Dell but HP, eventually they tell me they're terribly sorry for the inconvenience and will express deliver a third one next day -but OH NO THEY DIDN'T because it was out of stock. Tried to get some compensation for all the man-hours I'd wasted dealing with this rubbish, eventually they sent me one black toner cartridge. They clearly think their customers' time is as worthles as the junk they sell us. Eventually the THIRD one arrived, and actually it's OK. But that's not the point - unbelievably appalling customer service."
3,Not bad but...,"The all in one printer worked great at first, but then it started acting up more and more frequently. While the errors are fairly easy to take care of, it is still quite a bother."
3,Bad for the office.,"Prints regular paper fine, but try envelopes, or heaven forbid business card paper, and you're in for a world of frustration. It jams frequently with envelopes, and has tremendous trouble feeding business card paper properly. And it's a problem that can't really be helped.We bought it because it was cheap, we needed a new printer. If we knew about these problems beforehand (none of the reviews I read mentioned this, of course)we would have looked elsewhere. It's not worth it."
1,The printer that was purchased,"When I received this item I was excited that it had both the back and colored ink cartridges full, plus an extra black cartridge along with it, that's where the excitement ended. Once the printer was plugged in and should have been functional there was an un-resolvable paper jam that is unable to be fixed. When I called HP for diagnostic help with this problem I was told that this particular product was unable to be warrantied and that they couldn't help with any problems that may be happening. I will have to return this product and go through the headache of getting a new printer that actually works."
1,Printer for home,printer did not work . Did not feed paper. Had to return it.I am old and wanted this particular printer as I already have one and am familiar with it.Guess I will have to go to Staples and buy some other brand but thanks for your help.C G KLEPPINGER
1,Dont Buy this Machine,Had this 4215 All-in-one Printer for about two months. The paper feed for faxing has to be feed one by one or it will grab two pages at once. Also needs to be pushed to start as it dosent grab the pages without help. The paper tray holds about 125 sheets but HP Tech told me not to use more then 25 sheets otherwise printer grabs more then one sheet of paper. What good is an all-in-one that can only work with 25 Sheets of paper? Also uses alot of ink. Save your money and buy something else! I thought HP was better then this.
1,Ready to toss it out,"THis machine has made my life miserable. In the last 6 months, I don't think it has printed more than 3 faxes without jamming. TO make matters worse, the output tray is shared by the paper input tray. It just pulled in 6 pages of completed received faxes to use to print more faxes. I often find 2-sided faxes. This thing is way too tempermental and I'm tired of babysitting it. Not up to HP standards"
2,Cat the Great!,"This was my first mp3 player. I got a great deal at Big Lots paying only $25 plus tax. It sat on my table for about two weeks before I finally opened it. I had to sometimes touch the screen multiple times before it would work, and it seemed like I had to hold the power button extensively to power on/off. After using it for about 6 weeks the power button stopped working, so I can no longer turn it on at all. Fortunately, after calling Coby, I found out there was a 90 day warranty. Unfortunately, I didn't know there was a warranty, and I recycled my receipt after about 30 days, and they need a dated receipt to fix it. I would've given 3 stars, except that the button stopped working after about 60 days of use. I have ordered another Coby for myself, and one for my 8 year old son. The Coby prices are reasonable, and I'm hoping we'll have better luck with the different models that I purchased this time around."
1,worthless device,"i.m amazed why there is no protection for american consumer from device like this that is broken before you start.i receive mine as gift from me wife in christmas , but i did have scandisk 512 mb before so i never bother to open this piece of...but when i try to upgarde for more music, i just waist day of thinking that i did ,or i.m doing somthing wrong...please donate you money to someone poor bettter than get cheated and get frustrated from & by coby .Coby MP-C7095 MP3 Player with 2 GB Flash Memory with FM & Color Display"
2,El cheapo,Bought 2 units for christmas presents..and 1 is dead just after a fewhours. The light displays would not turn off...even after several unitresets. A couple of days after it would'nt even charge anymore...I should have read the fine print....Made In China
1,This is very upsetting,"We got this for my daughter for Christmas and it will not hold a charge. She opened it up and we have been trying to charge it ALL day. We even tried our other computer to see if it was the computers fault, so far NOTHING!! What we really hate is that the customer service is closed today because of the holiday so there is noone to talk to. I understand it is Christmas but it still sucks! This is the second item that she opened up today that was broke. We are going to return both items and get her an ipod."
1,Batteries Defective,"Hi Everyone,Please do not waste your money with this unit. I was taken with this unit when I first got it. Looked cool, good capabilities, and good memory were all of the positives I saw in it. The problem is that the unit will not hold a charge. Many, Many of us are having this same problem and I have to think that Coby knows about this issue. I returned my first one and got another with exactly the same problem. The internet has many posts from people looking for answers to this problem as well. Not worth one cent if it does not work."
3,It's decent for the price,"I recieved this player when I joined a travel club as a free gift, so I really can't complain about it. HOwever I did have to recieve another one because after a month or so, the power button broke and I couldn't turn it on manually. I could only listen to it in my car. But it is a good little player, I'm just a little more careful with my new one. Also it holds a decent number of songs, I don't put any videos on it because why go blind trying to strain your eyes watching that little screen, I use it just for music. The one big criticism I do have is the ear plugs are HUGE, I've never met anyone who can fit those enormous things in their ears. I did have to by a different pair, but it wasn't that bad, still has great sound."
3,its FRAGILE!!!,"well my recent mp3 player broke so i got this one.The look and price is very appealing, but one aggravating thing is the touch screen its so sensitive;also it scratches too easy you cant find a case for these things anywhere.I love the slimness but in time i will get another mp3 player and research it before i buy."
3,A little disappointed,I am limited in my experience with devices like this.I found it difficult to use.
3,OK but not great,"I purchased this mp3 to listen to audio books. The sound is great, even the little screen has great clarity-but- this player randomly stops when listening to the drm wma files sent from overdrive media console (library service)."
3,Review of Coby MP-C7095 MP3 Player,"I found the Coby to be easy to download to for music; however, it has been difficult to download picts and other media images. It is very sensitive to heat and whenever I have taken it to the beach or pool, it quits working within minutes of being in the sun (on my towel or chair). The battery life according to the manual is 20 hours of playback time - not even close! I do like the slimness of the unit but the touchpad control is so sensitive, you must use the hold button every time you play your tracks which is somewhat annoying if you like to manually skip to songs yourself. The sound quality is good. It works best with Windows Media Player and I did have difficulty getting it to download from any other program (i.e. Musicmatch Jukebox)."
1,Poorly Made. Not sure how it passed QC,"This is one of the worst mp3 players I have seen. The first unit I purchased arrived doa. The replacement worked, but the battery only holds a charge of about 10 minutes (appx length of 3 songs). The second unit that I had purchased at the same time works while plugged into a computer, but will not hold a charge at all.The touch pad is a nice feature but only works about half the time. However, this is just ""glitter & effects"" to mask how poorly made this mp3 player is. I made the mistake of researching this brand after purchasing it and it seems that there is definitely a problem with their batteries, among other things. I would recommend purchasing another brand."
2,decent sound but poor design,"decent sound but poor design. sometimes you need a pin to reset it. sometimes some songs are skipped with no reason. anyway it has a decent sound, better than sandisk sansa."
3,A great Mo Bowdre story...but the plot is left hanging,"I enjoy the Bowdre character immensely, and his meeting with a girl who claims to be his illegitimate daughter is an interesting one. However, other subplots (which start off as primary plots) are left unresolved or slammed shut with an announcement ""they caught the guy who did it."" It just seemed like a hasty wrap-up with no explanation or resolution on that part of the book. Mo does find out more about his daughter than he ever expected."
3,Uneven effort,"They're back. They're mad. Just not as mad as they were last time, I'm afraid. The beginning of the album is great, though.""Gimme Back My Brain"" is the most energetic and kicking song I've heard for a long time. ""Dance"", ""This One's For You"", ""I Am The Money"", ""Joey"" and ""Stalk & Slash"" are also excellent songs. BUT... it's the rest of the material here that just doesn't make it. I have grown to expect this band to raise riot or at least be a bit more menacing than this. Instead, half of the material here is just boring and safe midway rock songs. AOR might still be a too bad insult, but this doesn't give me too much expectations for the band's future."
3,Deflated,I really like this series but I felt like the final book left me wanting a real ending. Overall I can't say I really disliked this book because I really did enjoy it even if is was a slower paced book. I honestly just didn't like the ending and wish it would have been done differently. Anyway. Worth reading but I was disappointed with the ending.
2,Pass on this album,"While I like Frank Chacksfield, and had several of his ablums on old 33.3 RPM records, this album (CD) was a disapointment because most of the songs were not his usual recognizable hits. Several other available (on Amazon) albums of his contain many long time favorites, and I would recomend them instead. There is nothing wrong with the album, just the music was not what I expected."
5,Vehicle Voltron,"I am a huge voltron fan, especially the 15 vehicle version of him. I have Volume 6 which features the Air Team and thought it was fantastic. I have yet to watch Volume 7 which features the Land Team but I know it will be good. I can't wait to pick up Volume 8 the Sea Team."
3,Cardboard,The episodes are fine but the case is cheap cardboard and the discs vibrate in a PS3. This show was based on Dairugger.
3,Hard to evaluate,"The book reads like a well researched account of the battles. But there are no footnotes, no bibligraphy, and not even a bio of the author. So I enjoyed reading it, but it can harldly be considered authoratative.The fact that there are mistakes like saying the Rommell first met Hitler during the Polish campaign do not make me feel better about the book."
4,A delightful little book,"A really charming and very well-written novel; I was very much surprised at how good it was, and I actually shed a tear or two at the end."
4,Leaves you feeling good,"A delightful page turner set in a beautiful place. Good writing that reads well. Perhaps a bit far out in believability at a few points in the story, but endearing tale, most enjoyable characters and well worth the time to read."
2,Parallel to Old Testament Falls Short,"The topic of angels in Venice, presented on this fascinating book cover immediately grabbed my attention. I was also intrigued by the parallels drawn between this story and the Old Testament book, Tobias. However, although the writer was faithful to the Bible throughout most of this novel, she eventually lost the innocence of the Bible story, paricularly at the end of her book. I will never understand why writers, such as Ms. Vickers insist on sullying such innocence with unnecessary nudity and voyerism."
1,One can do better elsewhere,"It is terribly misleading to categorize this book as insightful about Venice. It really offers very little substantive information about the city. Other than the storyline revolving around a stone carving that happens to be in Venice, the story could as well be sitused in any other city. If one wishes to learn of the charm of Venice, try The World of Venice by Jan Morris or Venice for Pleasure by J.G. Links. The only interesting element of the book is its focus on an ancient folktale and its inter-weaving with a current repetition of the same story. While the author may deserve some credit for this inter-weaving, the characters are generally so one-dimensional and the dialogue in places so trite that it is difficult to see the novel through to its finish. For one seeking the same type of structure, read Possession by A.S. Byatt to see what a truly creative and professional writer can accomplish."
4,A review of this book made it sound quite interesting.,"And, though reviews can sometimes lead you astray, this book is a marvelous read! I enjoyed it from beginning to end. To see how far Julia Garnet travels, and how much she learns during this story, moved me. And the changes move along slowly. You aren't battered with them. The reader sees Miss Garnet trying to work things through, so that she can move forward as she needs to. A wonderful character."
5,Importance for me...,"The book is excellently written, and a gently intriguing story. Its impact for me lay first in the unexpected and quiet touches about Miss Garnet that were so exquisitely British, full of subtle, nuanced detail. The second importance was the story of Tobit and its lead to the Apocrypha. I love the notion that our human cultures layer interpretation on interpretation thru the centuries. The author's sympathetic, because local and detailed, description of Venice and its treasures was a further treat, for me. And associated with that, the clear message that we must all contribute if this Treasure that is Venice is to continue to exist in our world."
3,Pretty good,"It took me a while to get into this book, although I enjoyed the way it was written - the elegant, elevated prose with lots of delicious, arcane words. This created an air of detachment, as though the events were happening to the protagonist, instead of her controlling events. I'm not so sure whether the intertwining of the two stories completely succeeded. it was sometimes hard to switch from one epoch to another, especially when one was counter-realistic. i would definitely read other books by this author."
4,Different kind of novel,"I ordered this by just reading the review on Amazon. Having visited Venice, Italy, last summer I found this novel interesting by reading about someone visiting the area. It was an unusual book from what I usually read. I thought the main character had a refreshing outlook on a new life if only for a brief time.I would recommend this book, especially if you have been to Venice (to relive the experience.)"
4,"Raphael, the angel and Miss Julia, the teacher",I read this novel with the Book of Tobit in my Oxford Bible beside me. The other novel that I'd done this with was On the Road with the Archangel by Frederick Buechner. I'd suggest that to readers also. Miss Julia's Angel was well written but not nearly as well done as Possession which several reviewers have compared it to. I found some of the parts about Tobe and Sarah to be confusing and not much in line with the Aprocrophal book. And their wedding really didn't make sense to me. I read the novel in one day so I really did enjoy it.
4,A real find,"I picked this book up on a whim while visiting London earlier this summer. Like many other such purchases, I found a small treasure - a visit to a place I could not have expected. This is made even more interesting by another trip to Europe last month - to Italy, in fact. I just wish now I had found the time to visit Venice. But with the experience of reading this book, I can now look forward to the next trip - and this time it will include Venice.But more than just the ambience of Venice, this book using a device which I found reminiscent of A. S. Byatt's ""Possession"" with the juxtaposition of two narrative strands in very different historical contexts came together to produce a truly lovely and satisfying novel.Try this! You won't be disappointed."
3,Lyrical Parable,"Miss Garnet's Angel immediately hooks the reader with its promise of life altering experience, its aura of mysticism, and its ability to evoke a feeling for the special place that is Venice. As it develops, however, the plot grows entirely predictable, which diminishes the reader's sense of mystery. Conflicts are resolved rather abruptly, and except for Julia Garnet herself, characters are incompletely developed. If you love Italy and religious symbolism, though, this is an easy and fun read."
4,"Entertaining biography, NOT a tutorial about mnemonics.","This is an entertaining, well-researched BIOGRAPHY about a Jesuit missionary in China.If, like me, you were expecting a book detailing Matteo Ricci's method of enhancing his memory, you will be only partially rewarded. That subject IS brought up, with intelligent commentary, but (to use a metaphor) Ricci's mnemonics are only the 'frame' around the main 'painting'.The main painting is a thoroughly enjoyable, detailed picture of a Catholic missionary sent from Europe to China. Ricci's voyage of discovery as his ethnocentric training meets with China's equally ethnocentric culture makes for good reading.Readers interested in mnemonics will be partially rewarded. Readers will be thoroughly rewarded, if they are seeking entertaining Middle-Ages history about Catholicism, missionary work, Europe, Rome, Asia, or China."
5,Matters of great moment,"Spence's masterfully written book, a touching story of one man's devotion to a cause greater than himself, is a must read for all historians, especially those who want to learn more about the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, and their missions around the world. ""The Memory Palace"" is engaging--it reads like a mystery novel. I was unable to put it down until I was done for the book was an excellent read."
4,Book review,"It was a fair deal ad the book arrived within the estimated time. I have finished my review, but in order to fullfill this bizarre rule....."
2,"For history buffs, not for memory techniques",I was disappointed in the book for it gives detailed history of Ricci's time but very little information on his actual memory palace techniques.
2,Train of Consciousness...,"This book had some wonderful nuggets about Ricci and China, but there were so many tangents and mind-numbing details that it was challenging to read. The main issue is that the book is thematic in nature rather than chronological. On one page Spence is talking in detail about China in 1582 and the next he's talking in detail about Portugal in 1567. He flips back and forth across the decades and the continents enough that it's very difficult to get a picture of Ricci's life. A lot of Spence's content seems pulled from history books on Europe, having little or nothing to do with either Ricci or China. If you want a random, panoramic view of life in the late 1500's this book is for you. If you're looking for a comprehensive, orderly look at Ricci or China or his memory system you may be disappointed. It's worth the read, but with appropriate expectations."
3,Not About Memory Systems,"Having been hipped to the existence of the phenomenon of memory palaces by the books of Thomas Harris, (I'd forgotten all about them after reading one of Tom Wujec's earlier books) I was looking forward to finding a how-to book on the subject. The Memory Palaces Of Matteo Ricci, however, is, again not it. I already felt burned by Francis Yates' ""Art Of Memory"", which is more about Hermeticism than the purported subject.Interesting though it may be, the book is mainly about Ricci's life and times as a Jesuit missionary in China, something I would have gotten from any biography about the man, which in fact this is. There is some cursory mention made of the principles of using loci for the purpose of memory, but that's it. Not even Ricci's own method is analyzed or discussed in great detail."
2,Disappointing!,"I bought this book thinking that it would tell the story of how Matteo Ricci got to present Christianity to the very top echelons of China: how he got to China in the first place, the imaginative ways in which he presented Christ to the Chinese, and the reactions of others - both Christian and non-Christian - to his preaching and his accomplishments. As it is, the story presented in this book covers only a few of these topics, and then in no logical order. I just don't think that what is undoubtedly a fascinating story is well told! I don't recommend buying this book."
1,Room 101,"Gregory MacNamee's average mind is very annoying, this book is about a precursor of PSYOPS the ""psychological operations"" of the U.S. military and Madison Avenue. The Jesuits inquisition was using torture instruments for similar purposes, cultural genocide."
3,Product Good; Support Not,"Overall, this product is fabulous and I can't imagine running an organization without it. It is so easy to easily put together ideas and create presentations that allow individuals to ""learn"" the material, not just see a presentation. The company, though, is not particularly supportive about users problems with the software. Following a recent upgrade, my software became unusable, and Mindjet has not been particularly helpful."
1,Does not work with Microsoft VISTA,I could not make it work with MS Vista premium on my Toshiba laptop. But does work with my desktop XP system. Has no interoperability with OpenOffice. Only with MS office.
1,Product NOT received as described!,"I received the Lisle Hand Impact Tool Set today and as I removed the product from the Amazon box I immediately reacted to the sketchy nature in which this item had been wrapped. Sold to me as a ""New"" item, the box was enclosed in a large, oversized generic plastic bag that was, itself, sealed shoddily by strips of packing tape. I removed the Tool Set box from the bag, suspiciously, to find that the case as well as the impact tool itself were clearly in ""USED"" condition....far from new. Smudges, scrapes and dirt could be seen everywhere, inside and out. To confirm the fact that I was not receiving a ""NEW"" item, the 3/8"" drive bit holder (which is a separate peice that mounts on the wrench) was not even present in the box. The item is unusable because of this and it was sold under a description that was wildly misrepresentative of what I actually received. No, thank you. You better be covering my return shipping."
3,"The driver itself is great, but the bits are all junk","like the title says, the driver itself is great and works as it's supposed to. However, the bits are complete junk. they break every time you use them. I have snap-on impact screwdriver bits that are 3/8"" drive that I use with this. but for the price, it's still better than anywhere else or any other brand you can get from my experience"
5,Inspirational and exciting reading,"I found this book inspirational.The tips are well worth the price of the book. Excellent photos and illustrations.Thanks,Nancy"
1,Disappointing,"All of the technique demonstrations are of the author's own work, and with no illustrations of the techniques themselves, only the finished products. It's all pictures of fish. I like fish, but I was hoping for a broader range of examples, color palettes, etc. The book wasn't very inspiring technically or artistically."
3,Great starter book,"Tony Buzan's book is among the first books that got me started on speed reading when there wasn't much info about it going around.Although it's a good place to get started it's a little bit outdated.It will definitely help you improve your speeding skills.Especially for people that, like me, do most of their reading online on their computer.I created a web based application called Eyercize that let's you practice speed reading with online material. You can check it out @ http://www.eyercize.com"
3,Helpful --but-- not as much as it claims to be,"I felt the main content of the speed-reading course was not dealt with in adequate detail.The book starts by urging us to avoid certain bad reading habits that slow us down and there is a lot of motivational content that gives specific examples of speed-reading champions. The motivational section is really motivating.My disappointment is with the actual techniques, that I feel, are dealt with too briefly (especially the meta-guiding techniques). There is not much help here for a beginner. I was very keen on learning the techniques and was very motivated by his examples, but I felt defeated after trying to understand the meta-guiding techniques.Tips about sitting postures, ideal reading environment are really useful. I feel the vocabulary section is a misfit into this book and it more of a digression.Overall, I feel the book is not as much of help as it claims to be."
4,Good to see this on CD,"Pick up this album featuring the pre-Buggles 'Video Killed the Radio Star.' For those in the US who have heard the long out-of-print vinyl version, this album's version of 'Goodbye to Yesterday' is not the same, and some of the tracks sound like they were sourced from different tapes than others. Overall, though, the sound quality is quite good, and beats my old cassette of the vinyl by miles. Oh yes, and this album features a then little-known keyboardist by the name of Tom Dolby."
3,English Whodunit,Interesting murder mystery that takes place in England. Several murders are linked to a murder that transpired some 30 years prior to more recent murders. Meredith Mitchell and her inspector finance are hot on the trail. The author keeps you guessing and wanting to read more. A number of young people die before the murders are solved so that made the story somewhat sad. The story kept me involved and I enjoyed trying to decide who the murderer was.
3,Enjoyable,Agree with Laura Pressler regarding the grammatical errors/typos. It's really said when you pay for a book and the entire story line is disruped with these errors.
4,nice wrap,One size fits almost all. better than trying to wrap a towel around you. Use it on your next beach trip
1,Cheaply made,fell apart its first time out. Bad welds that were already creaking and popping as soon as it came out the box.
4,"Good stuff, unless you've seen Rick's more recent visit","I bought this thinking it was the show I'd recently seen on KCTS, but it was at least 5 years old. Of course, as much as the West Country changes, this is certainly not out of date. Rick hasn't changed much, either. He so obviously enjoys what he does(who wouldn't?) & he's been back and forth over this familiar territory. Zummerzet, Glocestershire, Cornwall, the West is Best!"
4,Blake Songs are the highlight,"I bought this recording because I adore the Blake songs and wished to have a recording of them at long last, and these are without question the highlight of this CD for me. I enjoy all the other songs, and Mr. Ainsley sings in tune with a beautiful tone, but they tend to blend together into one long opus."
5,Know Buddy cares,"Had to borrow that book title from ANGER MANAGEMENT because this guy is ALL heart . And family . Boy , does Buddy have a BIG family . A big family of honest , hard working , fun and funny men and women . Smart too . Oh , by the way , these folks KNOW cakes and baked goods . You're gonna fall in love with these fine folk and their excellent work . Lest they make you an offer you can't refuse ? If you doubt for an instant that these folks KNOW what they're doing , simply compare them to the OTHER cake show . These fine folk run a large bakery as well as create magic with great flair . No comparison son ."
5,Cake Boss 1,This is how the Cake Boss got started it. It explains some of the key players and the Bosses motivation. Love it!
5,great,"huge fan of the show. dvd was in brand new mint condition. great price, shipped fast too. very pleased gal."
5,"the best show, funny and entertaining...","It is the best show, its funny and entertaining to watch. I wish there where more shows like it. It comes down to what really matters in life and that is family..."
5,Awesome!,"This DVD was the best out of all! Buddy and his workers are very talented, which makes the DVD better."
4,Does the job!,"Platform makes standing on the ladder for more than a few minutes, much more comfortable. Easy to use, light weight, and sturdy."
1,Do not buy this product!!!!!!!,"First of all, this product is compatible with only little giant ladder, not with the other brand, which are usually a lot cheaper.With their suggestion that this one is compatible with the other brand, I bought, but found out it's not safe with other brand. I tried to return them for refund, but their customer service rep refused to offer refund.At Home Depot, you can buy Gorilla brand ladder,Made in China, with almost same function for half price.Anyway,is Made in USA better than Made in China these days, when tons of Chinese products are all over place for our daily life?"
4,"Well made, well designed unit.","This is a very well designed and built ladder platform. It's made from nice, thick aluminum and feels like it'll take quite a load. I also like that there is a cross member between the support struts for reinforcement. The only thing I don't like about this platform is that although it is ""proudly designed and engineered in USA"", it was made in china."
5,No ladder should be without one.,"Although designed for the Little Giant ladder, I have found that this unit will fit most standard size ladders. Until you have stood with both feet flat on a level plane, and not straddling one narrow rung like a bird of prey, you have no idea how stable and comfortable ladder work can actually be. Will never have a ladder without one of these as its sidekick."
4,Ok,"After the ladder ths was a damp squib, expected something more versatile / ambidextrous but this can only be used in one way, but it works."
3,Item was Damaged and appeared to be Used when purchased as NEW,"Order this brand new from Amazon. Upon arrival it appeared as if it had been dragged behind a car or like someone had taken a file to it. The platform was scrapped and other blemishes make it appear that this product was either used and returned and sold as new or it never should have been sold. I am very disappointed with this product and the quality I received.WAS ABLE TO TALK TO AMAZON AND RECEIVED A $10 CREDIT TO MATCH WHAT THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR A USED ITEM. The platform itself appears to be strong and will most likely be a great companion to my little giant, although I wasn't impressed with the initial quality of the item based on looks. Although it was delivered with blemishes(hopefully just a dud), it appears to be a good product that will hopefully last a long time."
1,not what i was expecting,"I love my little giant ladder, but this platform was a disappointment. It is only useful in a-frame configuration. What i needed was an adjustable platform for working as an extention ladder or in 90 degree configs."
3,Nice Stand for tools and such,"This is a nice addition to my lil giant. I will say though, I do not feel safe standing on this platform. Just feel as though it will cause the ladder to tip."
2,Not the author's best work,"I bought this book because I loved and adored Oppel's novel Airborn. Unfortunately, this much earlier work is not nearly so well-written. The imagery was pretty darn nifty, and the premise was moderately intriguing, but unfortunately that's really all it had going for it. The characters were uniformly static and the plot was generic. Try something more recent of Oppel's."
4,Good CD,"A good CD with good music, the only rather disappointing thing is that Maven's (Tough Enough Winner) Entrance Music isnt on the CD"
3,"Good alternative mix, but songs are too old","As you can expect, this is a modern disc, and it is also a mix of the best songs lately, or at least a year or two ago. The songs all go through a hard rock or metal center, and are bordered by not-so-intense sides, making for not much variety. That is good and bad, depeneding on your personal tastes. If you are an open person, this is a good disc. If you like modern rock and metal, this isn't a bad pick. Those who don't like hard rock or metal won't like this one. I liked it a little, but it got old really, really fast."
4,Tough Enough,"I just got this cd today, I was suprised at how good it was. It's a nice mix of rock/alternative songs. It's worth getting wresting fan or not."
3,Poorly written in contrast to his purely factual guidebooks,"I bought this book expecting something along the lines of Patrick Symmes Chasing Che. Instead I got something else entirely. Fair enough. I believe there is a market for this kind of swashbuckling travel writing. But it wasn't for me. And to be frank, it was poorly written. Too many words to say far too little. A better narrative requires fewer adjectives and less alliteration. I have seen this guy's guidebooks and they are actually quite good and well written. But his ability to guide did not follow over to his literary endeavor. He shouldn't really be faulted entirely though. After all, an editor's job is to make sugggestions, hone the prose, and pare down. In short, to edit. I give the subject matter a 5, Baker a 3 for the effort, and National Geographic editors a 1 for nothing."
2,"boasting, self-centered","I must say I became disappointed, because the author is so full of his own ego, lacking any style. Seemingly he wants to get in touch with the life of cuban people, but is staying an outsider. My 2 stars come because of the vast amount of historical facts."
3,God's gift to Cuban women,"I've always wanted to vistit Cuba, and I am a big motorcycle buff. So putting the 2 together is what attracted me to the book. I was hoping for insight into the Cuban way of life, a kind of personal view of what to see and do. I was not disappointed there, but the author's overuse of adjectives overwhelmed me as much as his egotistical sexual ""conquests"" of every pretty woman he laid his eyes on. The book could have been labelled ""Mi Moto and God's gift to woman"". I did also buy his Guide to Cuba which really is crammed with very useful information. I guess he must have been having fun writing ""Mi Moto Fidel""."
3,Unfulfilled Promise,"I began reading the book before a trip to Cuba. I continued to read the book while in Cuba, and I finished the book after returning from Cuba.It's interesting, especially, if you've been to Cuba.All of his observations are very accurate.but I found the book very easy to put down.But it did make me want to get a motorcycle, especially a Ural, the Russian BMW copy that are all over Havana.Many complain about the many sexual exploits.But that's also a part of Cuba.I just wished he'd gone into more detail.I'd like to know more about why he feels Cubans are so good in bed.His sexual adventures read more like ""had dinner."" I'd like to know more about the meal.I would like to visit the ice cream place in Havana as I never saw any lines while I was there."
5,Fascinating,"Not your typical travel guide, Baker holds nothing back in this personal account, be they his sexcapades, mental health, or political viewpoints."
2,"Conspiracy, anyone?","First, I am a muslim. So I'm not muslim bashing in the least.The idea that Christianity is the fulfillment of the Dajjal is pure nonsense. It is easy to see that this book was written in turn of the century India, when distrust of the west and christianity was at a all time high. I don't believe in Christianity, have problems believing in a sadistic God who cannot just forgive but demands blood. However, to signal out that one religion as the antichrist, when it is against all doubt and argument that they have done much for the world forthe good, is foolishness.While I usually like the Mualana's works, here he let his personal opinions and prejudices influence his writing. Hence, the low marks."
3,The Horse Whisperer: An Illustrated Companion to the Major M,"Was a little disappointed. Typos in book and reprint of most photos are poor quality. Many of Redford have had so much touch-up done, he is barely recognizable. I thought there should have been more about shooting the film and interesting problems they encountered. Fortunately they don't charge too much for it, so it's ok. Seems like it was put togerther quickly and that shows. But interesting nonetheless."
3,Glaring Flaw in Research for Book,"On first perusal, I was very impressed with the clear format, great photos and most of the content.However, a point, Sam Neil is a New Zealand actor, like Jane Campion, not Australian. The authors may not have been aware there is more than one inhabited nation south of the equator.If that is the one, if glaring, inaccuracy in the entire work, then, the authors have done a superb job."
1,Expect blisters and painful experience,This shoe peeled my heel's skin off and it gives me blisters. I would not recommend this shoe at all. Stay away!
1,Ouch!,"Unfortunately, the back of the shoe digs hard into my achilles tendon. Too painful, even with thick socks."
1,Horrible...,"I bought these a while ago. After wearing them for above a month averaging approximately 3 days a week, the stitching started to fall apart. Especially at the crease points where you bend your foot as you walk. For $30, I was expecting the shoes to last at least 6 months...very cheap quality."
2,Wrong Color/Poor Quality,The picture of the product was black. I received brown shoes with a scuff in the leather already. Not satisfied.
4,Great shoe for the price.,"I'm giving this shoe a 4 out of 5 due to the fact that the shoe was not comfortable right out of the box (like other reviewers have stated, the heel was stiff and dug into my ankles). I simply used some leather conditioner on the heel, bent it a couple of times, and VOILA, a fantastic looking and comfortable pair of shoes. Aside from the initial stiff heel, this shoe is extremely comfortable to walk in. I've had these for two years now and they still look great (take into consideration I only wear these about twice a week)."
1,Better off with Payless Shoes,"First, they tore through my ankles. When they finally broke in, they literally BROKE. Within 6 weeks, the entire heal of the right shoe nearly tore right off. Quite embarrassing. You get what you pay for!! Don't bother with these shoes!!!!"
2,Not comfortable out of the box.,These shoes tore up the back of my heel to the point that I was limping around by the end of the first day wearing these.
3,Looks great but not very comfortable,"I have to say that I am really pleased with the way they look, but not at all happy with how comfortable they are. Around the ankle it curves and digs in, causing problems if you are going to be doing any walking."
4,Pretty good for the price,"Alright, the shoes are a little harsh than your typical try-it-and-buy-it-in-store shoes. I've wore it few times to break it in... it's not that bad. It's with every dress shoes I've had before, they are all the same. Maybe I am cheap, I don't spend tons on expensive dress shoes. :)This is not my everyday or going out shoes. I'm only using them for special occasions. For the price I paid for, can't get any better."
5,Succinct. Reads like a lecture.,"The book is a wonderful introduction to probability. Explanations are clear and concise. Theorems and important results are presented efficiently (they aren't hidden as examples), unlike other texts (Stirzaker). For those on the Oxford course, the first term and a half is contained completely in the first 100 pages. Only qualm is my desire to have fully worked solutions, but no one seems to do that short of a separate answer book."
3,Good Film,This movie shows how love can connect us all and that support is very important for a relationship. The three main Characters are pretty good actors and made the sory come alive.
4,Less Punch More Drunk,Unfortunately is like a film ! The continuation never overpass the first one ! Good Bands ! But for Drunkers ! What happened to those songs ?
4,"Beautiful, sensual, passionate, and timeless ...","I purchased this CD on the recomendation of a friend, and have deemed it one of my personal foreign favorites. Overall, the album is very strong. Francoise Hardy's voice is unearthly and the musical arrangements are fantastic. I would say the album is influenced by a unique combination of Serge Gainsbourg, early American country, and '60s folk music. Her style is tireless, and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the French sound."
2,you can make better!,"sprouts do not do well. the pots sit 2 tall not allowing the roots to submerse in hydroton & water. my plants are only 1"" after 11 days from germination."
3,bubbler system,this is a dwc hydro system didnt come with wick had to make my own works ok not good for seedling stage air stones are not worth using bought 3 inch disc works great now 3 stars
1,Best to D.I.Y.!,"Worthless. Use only Nylon (such as NYLON ROPE) as it works the best as a wick for the roots, yet never have to worry about the wicks becoming rotten, such as with cotton wicks. Also, air bubbles are not needed when using nylon rope wicks.Build your own out of Tupperware cases, 2 liter plastic soda bottles, potting soil, and nylon rope for wicks (no air pump needed this way because there is no worry of the roots rotten off. MAKE YOUR OWN OUT OF GARBAGE FOR FREE."
1,not hydro,its a root soaker not a hydro ponic unit did not like it sent it back i could set planters in a water bowl and have same thing its not a ebb and flood system its just a tank of water with air blowing thru it
2,Some issues,"Should come with wicks for the plans, and the ph tester in mine came broken and spilling in its bag.the machine is ok but was not impressed with how it actually came in the box, rather cheaply and one of the packages of rockwool didn't even come with the paper around the cubes to keep them in form. Kinda disappointed for an expensive contraption."
4,Great way to see if you like hydroponics,"This seems a great value in that the kit provides everything (except the plants and or seeds) to get started. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the air pump that came with the kit was too loud. Really detracted from the tranquility of my back lanai. I solved,that problem by getting the Tetra 77851 Whisper Air Pump for less than $7. Really lives up to its name and now I have a 5 star system."
5,Nice Beginner's Hydroponics kit,"Emily's Garden is a terrific small kit for those wanting to grow plants indoors. It's a passive wick system. Very simple to set up and maintain. Perfect size for herbs and vegetables. After harvest, you can replace the wick material with felt from your local fabric store. Much more cost-effective than the stuff from a hydroponic shop. The air pump and hollow ""air stones"" or tubes can also be found at your local pet supply store, if you need to replace them."
4,easy to use,"I have started a small garden in the hydrofarm. It was easy to set up. The pump is a little noisy so you don't want it in a bedroom. I so far have harvested salad greens. Now I'm working on trying to grow swiss chard, tomatoes, and green beans. It is a fun hobby. I am doing better with this then when I grow plants from seeds in dirt."
2,Everything you need. . . and don't,"This is more like a science project than a grow system.Pros:SmallModerately pricedCons:Air tube is too short (in the picture they have given, the air pump is at water level. The air pump is NEVER below the water, but they don't give you enough tube to deal with it)Air stones are too smallClips for air stones aren't aligned properlyThe drainage and water level valve LEAKS!!!!Extremely loudI'm in the process of rigging it up so I can use larger air stones and a larger pump. I am also going to the hardware store to buy a new seal and probably some sort of caulking (you're looking at damn near what the system costs). I will update this review after all that is completed.There are systems out there that I would recommend over this to family and friends. I can't say it's good for a novice grower because I don't know that a novice could fix all the manufactures mistakes. Maybe I just got a bad system. Don't risk it. Look elsewhere."
3,Good for starters but you can easily DIY,"I bought one of these for a closet grow, for larger plants I suggest buying a 50 gallon fish tank pump and connecting two large airstones. The ones that come with it barely put out any bubbles. Other than that I have had great success!"
4,Simple and Complete...,"The Emily's Garden is a simple and relatively complete Deep Water Culture, hydroponic system. It's easy to set up and to maintain. Though the system comes with a pH test kit, it doesn't include the pH UP or pH Down that will be needed to make the adjustment, so be certain to order that as well. I was hoping for a low maintenance set-up, but am learning that water (nutrient solution) needs to be added almost daily as the plants grow larger. The only other change I would suggest is that you go ahead and buy an air-stone. The supplied bubbler tubes are less than satisfactory. A 4"" air-stone won't cost more than $3.00 and makes for a significant improvement."
1,Poor,"I am very disappointed with this product. I've not used it for cooking, nor do I intend to; I can't get past having a lot of black stuff come off on the towel when washed. I've washed it 3 times, 'seasoned' it twice, and STILL get black stuff on the towel when drying. Black stuff that I do not intentd to ingest!"
2,fun for a few hours,its simple but fun its a game you play it twice and your done but its worth it if your a gamer who playes once a week this is a good game for you but any pretty good gamer will be done with it in a few hours like most collections you choose whether to get it or not but i personally don't think you should buy it.
1,Disgusting,"I saw this book at a local book store. The cover made me think it would be photos of beautifully decorated natural aquariums. Instead, I was disgusted to find most of the decorative themes could best be described as industrial. One suggested setup had a tank with eggbeaters stuck into the gravel, instead of plants! Others are just as attrocious. If you want a book about aquariums with style, buy any of Amano's _Nature Aquarium World_ series."
5,Haunting and Beautiful,"I became facinated with plantation culture as a child and regardless of its wrongs it was a time that we will never see again. The monuments to this time are the great plantation houses that are still being lost at an alarming rate. Some of the greatest examples have already been gone for decades and are all but forgotten like: Belle Grove which was a greater house than Nottoway or Uncle Sam which would have put Oak Alley to shame. Thankfully we still have some traces of that time still with us but what are we doing to save what we have left? That is the nature of this most execellent book and the best to come along for a long time. Not since ""Ghosts Along the Mississippi"" by Clarence J. Laughlin has this subject been covered with more sympathy for the loss of these treasures from the past. A perfect companion book for ""New Orleans-Elegance&Decadence"" by the same authors."
3,"beautiful book, well reseached info","No question , this is an absolutly gorgeous book, no complaints there. However, it was slow shipping, and the corners of the books were all of them damaged, bend, a disappointment...and that is why I only gives a 3 stars."
2,WHERE'S MIT? GEORGIA TECH? BERKELEY?,"Forget about this book if you want to get into an ""Ivy League"" School. MIT, Georgia Tech, Berkeley, Purdue, Stanford, U of Texas...none of them are in this book...too bad, this book is not helpful to choose a right program...If you want information on one of the schools listed in this book (like Clarkson University, U of Hartford) the book could be useful. However, fact sheets on the schools are not always complete.For example, you will not find GRE average scores or minimun required scores for most of the schools and it is not clear if the schools do not require it. Student profile figures neither are complete for most of the schools. In conclusion: 3 Stars for quality of information given f / each school, 1 Star for the variety of schools profiled - Average 2 Stars."
3,can't handle hi watts,it works fine for low wattage items but burns out immediately when used for higher voltage.
3,Funny in spots,"My Life on a Plate by India KnightMy Life on a Plate is about Clara Hutt, a 33-year-old housewife, married to her perfect husband of 8 years. She has two young boys who keep her busy at home, and during the day she works part time for a magazine. Throughout this novel, Clara makes observations about her life, her marriage, and what she could expect out of her somewhat boring future.I found myself laughing at some of her observations and antics, but overall, I didn't see where this book was taking me. It is light reading, part of the ""brit chick lit"" genre that was made popular by Bridget Jones' Diary. However, this novel is nowhere near the wit and style of Bridget Jones. I found that this novel was going nowhere, and realized there was a point to the story only after I reached the last chapter. I recommend this book only for the interesting characters that weave in and out of the book, but over all, I can only give it 3 stars."
4,"More Than Just a ""Married Bridget Jones""","Yes, the parallels to Bridget Jones are there: an introspective, rather flighty middle-class London woman with a neurotic mother and that ever-so-popular dry, English sense of humor. However, this book deserves a readership in its own right. India Knight's writing is above all, honest, and the main character is above all, extremely likable. The relationships with her husband and her friends are very well done."
3,For the mother of all moms,"""No children would ever be born if one approached the whole subject with any kind of logic.""India Knight must be a mother. There is no other way she could have voiced such honest truths in this book of motherhood, marriage, and the endless carreer juggling.""He made me a mother and I will always be grateful; he could murder me now and I'd still say thank you for that. But then he took something away from me: his desire; my old self.""For any wife, wondering who she married. For any mother who wouldn't trade it for the world. And for any woman who misses the girl she used to be... this book is for you."
2,time to clear the table and wash the dishes,"i was somewhat disappointed with this novel. it seemed long and draggy at times. i guess after seeing the cover i was expecting it to be a lot more fun and not so downtrodden as it was.clara seemed displeased with most of her life (right there was a downer). there were some funny one-liners throughout, however this was not as light and airy as i expected.i found clara's relationship with her mother quite sad. her mother was a domineering, sarcastic, critical woman. clara tried hard to please her mom, but to no avail. i thought it was sad, as well, what happened to her and her husband. everybody seemed so complacent, but we found out differently.for me the book started to pick up with about 40 pages left.anyway, it was not a light read for me and i have decided to stick with only the hysterically funny novels, as life is too heavy as it is, and since i read for fun i don't need to read about it."
1,Waste Of Time,"To say I was disappointed with this book would be an understatement in the extreme. I feel cheated, not only out of the dollars that I paid out for this dross, but also out of the time I spent sitting reading it, when I could have been doing something more productive. In fact anything would be more productive than reading this. I'm not saying this book is totally useless, you could use it to line a cat box, but if your thinking of buying it to read, save your money. Any book would be a better read than this one."
1,how did this ever make it to paperback?,"I've only reached page 45, and it's clear that I won't be able to finish this book. I am no prude, but I am already sick of Clara's references to number two, and farting. She is extremely petty, judgemental and shallow. So far, I haven't been able to identify any redeeming qualities in Clara that will make the book worth finishing. Frankly, I can see why her husband has tuned her out."
4,Entertaining and Enjoyable,This book was fun to read. The characters were convincing and realistic. Although the end was just a little predictable India Knight still manages to keep the reader's curiosity aroused. I would recommend this book to others.
4,well written novel with interesting insight,"A well written novel with insights into the English culture. Interesting characters, but it is a light hearted story. Good fun."
1,Rip off-not labeled correctly,The product information was not helpful-it turned out to be only volume 2 out of 3 volume set.Returned to Amazon-nice as always-so just waiting for my refund.We will never buy another OCR book-you don't know what you are getting.
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is greatttttttttttttttttttttttttttt for kids and adults although i don't have this movie I still love it i saw it when i took it out from the cambridge library + i'm getting this movie and faerie tale theatre hansel and gretel on amazon.com. I abousloutley loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this movie although i have seen it a million times I still think Kids and Adults will also love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,need pictures,I would be very interested in purchasing this product if I could see what patterns this book has inside of it.
5,Good ideas,"I enjoyed reading the book, it has several good photos of ideas used. It validates my decorating scheme!"
5,A must-have for the flea market devotee,I could not put this book down. The first half is devoted to profiles of flea market junkies and how they use their unusual (and some are VERY unusual) finds in their home decor. The second half of the book is the ins and outs of shopping flea markets and what to do with the treasures. One of the best books in this genre.
1,"The pictures spoke 1,000 horrible words","I was so excited to get this book because I LOVE to decorate and I see beauty in basically everything. I have tons and tons of ideas, but you can never have too many. I definitely agree with the other reviewer who said to check out the book before buying it- because like her, I didn't care for the book AT ALL- I actually HATED it! In all honesty, it was a book of crap- they did nothing with the finds to make them more appealing (they are ugly) and it still looks like crap in their house next to all the other garbage they got from flea markets. I didn't bother reading any of the text because the pictures spoke 1,000 horrible words.I love the better homes and gardens magazines called ""100 decorating ideas under $100"". Now, this is a magazine I learn a lot from and they have beautiful and cheap ideas using garage sale and flea market finds.This book, on the other hand, I want to trash- wasn't worth the money I paid."
1,Not what I hoped for,"I got this book used after reading good reviews but I was disappointed to say the least. It had nothing new or creative to speak of, in fact I found that it hardly had any ideas at all. I love thrift store shopping and I love to see how creative people have used or repurposed their treasures but this book fell flat. So glad I only paid a few bucks for it but ended up giving it away."
3,Decent book...,"There's a lot of information in this book, but it's a bit outdated. Some of the pictures are really great, but most just seem mediocre. Based on the cover, I thought the decorating would be a bit more masculine, but that was not really the case. I would recommend passing on this book, and get Junk Beautiful or Thrifty Chic instead. Not bad, but not all that impressive either."
2,Check it out of the library before buying,"I agree the rusty chair/furniture and hospital guerny are not very appealing. This book is good for little tips and odds and ends but not as good as Better Homes ""Cottage Style"" book which I have to say is THE BEST. I am glad I checked it out of the library before I bought it. It went a little to over the top on the shabby chic/flea market look for me not very elegant. The pictures are good because of professional photos but I bet if you were in a home filled with some of this stuff it could end up looking a little too flea-ish. Check it out first at the library."
3,Call it a hard bound magazine way past subscription cost....,"I'd give it three stars because it does reflect the title of the book and there are beautiful pictures which reflect decorating ideas. It might look good on your coffee table, but it doesn't match the editorial description at all. Only a few pages dedicated to do-it-yourself ideas(and those are no-brainers)! If you've never seen Country Living, Country Home, or even Better Homes & Gardens magazines, this might impress you. Final word: It might work as a gift, but you can find much more decorating ideas and how-to guides from $20 worth of magazines."
1,Ummmmmmmmmmmm...,"This guide is very, very dumb cuz all it duz is take the fun out of the game. A game is supposed to test your brain in mysteries and adventure, but with this (so- called helpful) guide, it takes every little step for you, and all you need to do is move your finger to move your Link dude, and that's that. Game Over.-sucks"
5,"Jettingham, The Best","I live very close to where these guys are from and have been listening to them for awhile. They're going to explode onto the music scene. The entire cd is one that you can listen to all the way thru and say they didn't make a few songs just to fill a record. As soon as you hear Cheating you'll like this band. Guaranteed. If you dont own this cd, you're not living!!! ..."
1,cheap and still not worth it,"I purchased this book at a garage sale for twenty five cents. After reading it, I almost went back to that house and demanded my quarter back. This angry woman feeds off the habits and personality flaws of others. Has she looked in a mirror? I realize that she is almost 70 and probably feels she is entitled to act the way she wants, but this book reads like it was written in one hour. I usually pass books to my friends to keep them in circulation, but I am burning this book in the fireplace this winter. Making fun of funerals? There wasn't more than one or two funny things in this whole book. She should stick to her X-rated stand-up act."
2,A big disappointment!,"Joy should keep her day job. I love her on The View, but writing is not her strong point. Her writing style makes the book very difficult to read and some of the stories (her fantasy about having sex with God) are either boring or unsettling."
2,Not as funny as expected,"I think Joy Behar is very witty and funny on The View. She is the main reason I tune in. I read her book expecting big laughs, but got just a few weak chuckles instead. My suggestion is don't waste your money - take it out of the library or borrow it. It only takes about one hour to read and about two seconds to forget."
4,Typical Victorian erotica,"I didn't find anything new or refreshing about the plot, though the erotica was titillating and exciting."
4,Not a small puller,"The picture of this puller is deceiving....it is ONE HUGE puller. It must weigh in around 20 pounds..I don't remember, but it's big. The cable is, I believe, 3/8"" (maybe 5/16""), and the handle uses compound leverage to obtain the required amount of force necessary for the 3 ton capacity. It has a relatively short length of cable. The use of a snatch/pulley to double the pulling force, as can be used on smaller pullers, probably wouldn't be used with this, unless you're pulling a house off it's foundation. It works quite well, although somewhat stiff (maybe just new), and the retrieval rate is somewhat slow. It is very well built (Maasdam is), and will last a lifetime. Not something you would have in your trunk for emergencies, unless you didn't want much of anything else in there as well. An excellent puller for the big big jobs."
3,Riverdance,"The DVD is ok, I personally prefer the original Riverdance show video, I am not sure if that is available on DVD right now. The one with Michael Flatley and Jean Butler. This DVD is more like all the shows that have ever been put together to create composition of the Riverdance show. The incredible think to see through this composition is how effortless and beautiful Jean's Butlers dancing is. There really is no comparing her to any other lead dancers from different shows. The same goes for Flatley. That is the only thing that bothers me about this DVD that it is all the shows combine together. I will definetly purchase the original Riverdance when it becomes available on DVD again."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with one reviewer who says this is a documentary, but I don't agree that it's worth the money you'll spend on it. I bought it because my three-year olds love to watch Irish dancing, but there was so much talking and singing that we all grew bored and turned it off. I never got to the part about Flatley's ego. The only advantage to the spliced dance numbers is that you get to see how ridiculous Flatley looks with his shirt open to his navel, as compared to the other male leads. Overall, don't bother with this unless you have everything else made by Riverdance and you need that one CD more."
5,Riverdance,I love to watch Michael Flatley perfom. Thisis by far an awesome example of of many talented people. The whole show is most inspiring.
2,very disappointing,I had high hopes on this and was very disappointed after watching the pieces. There was just no continuity. Everything was cut and pasted with no flow and one would lose all patience with all the talking. There's a lot of bits and pieces with no real enjoyment in watching. My money was a total waste on this DVD.
3,The Best of Riverdance,Too much talking on this DVD about the making of Riverdance. I was disapointed about the purchase.
2,Good for Groupies,"Most of the video was behind the scenes footage consisting of quickly changing odd camera angles. There was very little actual performances which is what I wanted when I bought the video. So if you are interested in the backstage drama and preparations for the production, this is the video for you."
4,Exciting and eye-popping,This will keep you glued to the screen with the athletic abilities of the dancers.Only drawback is you have to pay close attention to the segments as the costumeschange throughout the segments. It's been carefully spliced with many performancesincorporated into each dance segment.
1,Where is my DVD???????????????????,"Hi , I have not yet received this DVD It was meant to be a Xmas gift . Very diapointed"
3,Not What I expected,"I am a hudge Riverdance fan who has been unable to see my original VHS tapes in a long time. However, this version is disjointed with way too much jumping between lead dancers. I like Jean Butler but having her constantly interrupt between each dance loses the flow and rhythm of the show. Her information was educational, but I wanted to hear music and see dancing! The scene selection starts with Butler's narration so even when you pick out a dance you still need to fast forward. I miss my original Riverdance filmed in Dublin, it showed way more of the dance. Again, the editing is quite poor, never following their feet for more than a flash. I was sadly disappointed, but I'm still a hudge fan of Riverdance."
5,energizing,The DVD was excellent. The quality was what I expected and the DVD was energizing to watch. Don't watch it before going to bed for this reason.
2,Where's the original?,"Where can I get the 'original' Riverdance -- the one we saw on TV? I have it on VHS, but it doesn't seem to be available on DVD."
3,Too much changing scenes,It became distracting to bounce from one concert to the next (during the same dance number)
2,Disappointing,"I love Riverdance and the others, but this is NOT the one you want. Especially if you like Flatley.He is in just one dance and it was not his best. I doublt if I can return this, but I know that they have MUCH BETTER under another title.Michael Flatley is the one that gives it that extra something.Sorry about the bad review, but this is not your best choice.Michael Flatley is a showoff, but that is okay, I just smile and put up with him. He is great IMHO."
2,Low resolution for a DVD.,Seems to be a VHS bump-up. Not satisfied at all. Would not trust this vendor again. Sad for such a classic performance.
1,The Best of Riverdance,"I just recieved ""The Best of Riverdance"" today along with ""Riverdance Live From Beijing"". I have seen Riverdance three times and each time was better than before. Last week I was honored to see the last performance of Riverdance here in the United States at WolfTrap in Virginia. I had to get more of it. So I ordered these 2 DVD. I put ""The Best of..."" in my DVD player and all I got was the music, no picture. My unit plays every kind of DVD, including dts. I thought it was my TV, but then it played every other DVD I put in. I tried the DVD on two other TV/DVD compo TVs. Neither of them could even play the DVD. Now the music may be great but without the picture it isn't worth a cent. I hope that maybe it is just a bad DVD that I received from importCDs.com via Amazon. Just be aware of the DVD that you receive."
1,Be careful,"Please just be careful,this is not the best of riverdance ,it is a few scenes not their best,if you are going to buy something of riverdance this is no the correct answer."
2,best of riverdance,"as interesting as some of the background was; I purchased this dvd to enjoy the glory, power and dynamic of the Irish folkdance equated to Riverdance. The music minus the dance is understandable during a "" show"" but when you are compiling "" a best of "" from 8000+ performances there should be a predominance of the dance; the dancers didn't need time to change costumes and grab a breather in a compilation product. totally disappointing that the producer felt good about marketing this crap."
1,You can't overcome bipolar disorder in 3 lifesaving steps!,"Frankly, I am surprised by the number of favorable reviews already submitted here! The content is so generic/inspirational, Olson could easily have done a global ""search and replace"" and written about a ""3-Step Lifesaving Formula to Conquer Game Show Anxiety"" or any other perceived challenge. I found this book incredibly simplistic and repetitive, very disappointing, and in general, poorly written. For anyone who has done any reading at all about bipolar disorder, there is nothing remotely new here."
3,Motivating,"This book is helpful if you're at the end of your rope. Basically, it instructs you not to give up, and tells you how the author eventually became cured through perseverence. It does not give you practical ways to overcome your depression, ie cognitive therapy or other kinds of self help. It motivates you to seek help and try every possible way to get better-- different doctors, medications, etc."
4,Will help some people,"The author and I agree philosophically that moderate to severe depression or bipolar disorder is probably best treated with medication. However, the lack of solid information about psychotherapy in this book is something I don't agree with. And the quality of writing isn't that great, either. Nonetheless, the author has a somewhat unique approach to treating mental illness that is worth hearing. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
2,Have to agree nothing new here,"recently diagnosed bipolar I started reading all the books I could get my hands on. This book really offered me nothing. He kept talking about steps but, when you're stuck way deep in a depression some just can't take those steps, and the same is true if you're on a manic high..I do have a question though...if he was so depressed how was it that he could get up, take his wife to work, go back and get her for lunch, then go back to pick her up after she got off. when I'm depressed I can't even take my daughter to school."
1,"Simplistic, egocentric, poorly written","My prior review of this book was more current than many included here, but is now missing. Perhaps negative reviews of books hurts sales for Amazon.com.? Also, the ""editorial reviews"" for this book were written by the author and the publisher. Real objective! By the way, it was the correct medicine that cured Olson's depression, not ""his steps."" He says so himself in the book. Incidently, I've suffered from severe depression for five years, and I know the difference the right medication can make."
2,Bad Sales Pitch,"This book seemed devoid of any real content. It seems the author spent most his time writing about how good the book is and why the reader needs to buy more copies of it. There is some good material in it, but only enough for me to give it two stars."
2,Not truly new information,"The message of the book, to keep persevering no matter what, is not new. Nor does he address the point of fact about bi-polar people tend to stop taking their medications when they feel better, which has nothing to do with perseverance.Also, his arrogance is astounding. It's as if he says, ""I did it, so you should be able to as well!"" Bully for him! It's called bi-polar disorder and sometimes the disease manifests itself in such a way that what he touts in his book is not immediately possible"
4,the amazon review,"This book is a beautifully illustrated, fun, and interesting book. The pictures are so amazing and it feels like I am really there, (or wish that I was there). This book is a educational book because it has maps that show where the author, Peter Lourie, went when he was exploring. It tells what cities are there, and also where the bodies of water are. This is a fun book because the author, Peter Lourie, gives wonderful writing like this:Now as we left the tribal outpost and headed back the way we had come, we glided down river with the soft, slow, ancient current.An interesting part was when the Indians put the poison in the water where the fish would swim and it would be easier to catch the fish.This is why this book is the best!"
5,This Is The Best Book I Ever Seen,This is a good book because it gives a lot of detail of what is going on in it.
4,A Helpful Review,"The Star Spangles possess a fantastic and original style, full of both flair and non-conformity. And that's just their dress sense. They sound like the Strokes would if they played whilst strapped to an electric chair. Ian Wilson has superb vocal support from the rest of the band, creating a real feeling of unity when they play together. They intersperse smooth harmonies with scruffy and urchinlike vocals occasionally reminiscent of The Libertines. Songs like 'The Party', and 'Stay away from me' drill inside your head and can only be removed by constant humming. There is much more to come from the Star Spangles, who are rapidly rising from the ubiquitous New York scene. But then, could you expect less from a band boasting a musician named Tommy Volume?"
5,Sweet!,"Hard to beat the ""A Helpful Review"" on how good these guys are, so I'll simply add my two cents. This is GREAT high energy, kick your feet up music with edge- makes you want to turn up the volume and rock away. Talented group and out of the ordinary! Can't get enough and looking forward to more from you! (Planning on playing Portland, OR any time soon?? *hopes*)"
4,Punk + Glam = The Star Spangles,"This album is the first album by punk/glam rockers, The Star Spangles. This band has the best of both worlds. They got the power chord crunch and simplistic song writing from The Ramones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols. They got the swagger of the Rolling Stones and the guitar solos of the late 80s hair metal. Quite a combonation! Their music should be on all radio stations across the country. The songs ""Which One Of The Two Of Us Is Gonna Burn This House Down"" and ""L.A."" are the best songs on this disc. If you like the Ramones or Pretty Boy Floyd, take this trip down memory lane."
5,DULCEmente MALIGNO ~~ SWEETMalignity,THIS cd is as If you Could HeaR the sound that makes your HeaRt when ure just been let down by someone u love..when all the Hopes and ExpecTations u had on that Special realtionship are gOnE...when all the beautifull moMents you kNOw u could have with someone... ...DON't Happened.....This is the sound of a WOUNDED Heart.......
3,Can understand why some people love it and yet some hate it,"Well, I recently reviewed this and said it was innovation gone 'pear-shaped.' However, the strangest thing happened today. I was listening to it again, and I must admit, I actually started liking the songs I played (the first half of the album). I like music of all kinds really, but the distortion didn't work for me for a while. Now it seems to have the same kind of adrenaline rush on me as the likes of Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins & Faith No More. Oh man, I'm confused. Well, the title of this review sums it up!"
5,one of the most important listenings in my life,"this along with the pixies ""doolittle""and the stooges ""funhouse"" and the velvet underground ""white light white heat"" is the most important listenings in my life it made me love rock again cause before i was very cynical of all the rock cliches and lost that joy of rock this record has everything i would want on a record from abrasive noise to beautiful pop sense all the while sounding like there having the time of there lifeswith lyricals that range from being funny (its so hard)to the serious (somethings wrong)i would recommendthis to anyone who likes there pop fun and noisy"
3,Over rated,"Well, more like 3 1/2 stars. I like this album, but it's nothing great. Important, yes. But not great. A lot of what they did had already been done by the Velvets before them, and done better. A lot of this comes off as rather boring, as oposed to sonically menacing. Granted, they did just what they were trying to do: emulate the Velvets and the Beach Boys, but that doesn't mean they should have done that. To me, even supposedly classic tracks like ""Just Like Honey"" come off as dull, and uninspired. To everyone who loves this because it was important, that's one thing. But for people who actually love this album, listen to any My Bloody Valentine, Ride's ""Nowhere"" or the Velvet Underground's ""White Light/White Heat"" and tell me which one was better, and more inspired."
2,....,"I'll give credit to the Jesus and Mary Chain for coming up with something relatively novel in 1985. They combined early-60s melodies and song structures with crushing feedback, a la everybody's favorite name-check band, the Velvet Underground. OK, that's neat. Except that they repeated this concept song after song, again and again. In other words, this is a very repetitive album. Other than the memorable opening tune, Just Like Honey, the songs sound virtually the same. They did inspire My Bloody Valentine, one of my favorite bands, but MBV were much more creative in their shoegazing feedback, using different textures, whereas this album is just a sheet of noise."
5,"Great,great, album","This is a superb album, one of the best of the '80s, no question. But I have a question. I have the import cd, and I heard the domestic version of Psychocandy on Def American sounds better. Can anyone verify this?"
3,Good beginning,"this album is good, but it's way overrated by many critics and fans. I would rate this album 3 1/2 stars. It's a good first album and I like their adventurous spirit. There are several good songs like ""just like honey, the living end, the hardest walk, cut dead, taste of cindy, sowing seeds, my little underground, and something'w wrong."" The rest of the album is basically too much feedback and not enough song structure. Feedback is only good if it's still a catchy song. It could have been a classic if all the songs were written like the ones I've mentioned."
5,"Not for everybody, but certainly for me","Alot of people hear this album and think of it as the worst piece of trash ever recorded. I absolutley love this album. The sound is so unique and so incredible. The majority of it takes a darker view of life, yet does not depress the listener, simply fascinates. The other songs, such as Just Like Honey, Some Candy Talking etc. are alittle more upbeat yet fit perfectly in the mix. I fortunatley had no trouble getting a copy in the states but I guess you can't buy it new unless its imported. If you don't mind spending a few extra bucks, i would highly reccomend this album; it's one of the best I've ever heard."
4,Killer,"This is totally killer! Pop songs with nails-on-chalkboard guitars. The guitars are all over the place, lots of echo, way up in the mix. The vocals sound good and the lyrics are about all the best stuff in life: girls and drugs. They could have been huge stars, the songs are ridiculously catchy. Maybe it was too abrasive to be a massive hit. If people were smarter that wouldn't matter. I especially like ""Taste the Floor."" It's one of the louder, murkier tracks on the record. ""You Trip Me Up"" and ""Just Like Honey"" are excellent too."
4,Tasty Bible Stories,This book was more for children and their recipes did not follow along with what would have been available during Bible times. The stories were interesting and I did display one of the pictures of Ruth and Boas on my serving table at our social services.
1,Dissapointing end to a stellar series would be an understatement,"I cannot put into words the dissapoint I felt with the conclusion of the X-Files mythology. I'll keep it short and sweet by telling you that you'd be better off buying the first three mythology sets (abduction, black oil and colinization)and skipping this one; it will save you a huge dissapointment. Aside from the fact that Mulder is only in the final episode of season 9 (the same goes for the minute and a half of total screen time we get to see the smoking man) this chapter of the mythology is a total let down. Very little is addressed regarding colinization and the the aliens; instead they focus the remainder of the mythology on the ""super soldier"" concept, which becomes very tiresome after about 2 episodes. What was Chris Carter thinking?! As I said previously, my advice is to watch the the first 3 sets and leave the this fourth ""Super Soldiers"" installment where it belongs - on the shelf."
2,Not Necessary,"The CD arrived a week or so after the Sinucleanse neti pot and saline packets I'd ordered. So, before it arrived, I found a demo video online for another brand of neti pot and I learned how to use one correctly. When the CD came, I looked at it to see if I'd missed anything important. The CD did include background information about the location of the sinuses and how the sinus rinse worked on them, in addition to a demo of the neti pot use. The CD was informational and interesting, but not necessary. Save your money and watch a demo video at no-cost online; plus you won't have to wait for the item to be shipped."
4,Worth your time,"I was a little dubious about this book when it was suggested that I read it, but I respect the co-worker who suggested it and decided to give it a try. It is an informative and emotionally challenging read. The book offers a different perspective about parenting, without passing negative judgements as many subject-related books do. The most useful component of this book is that it suggests small changes and shifts in focus to help families support a child who struggles emotionally and socially. These small changes do bring some measure of peace for parents who have been struggling to help their children become productive and successful people in the world."
5,great book,I love the approach of this book and how clear cut it is to implement the techniques. I have seen a difference in my son.
4,"Good, maybe a bit repetitive","The book could have been much shorter, but it was worth the money for the points system. We went from the punishment and grounding system to a point system where you earn your privileges. Half of my son's points are for behavior and half are for responsibilities. We change point values once in a while, and I made sure he created the list with me. He reminds me every night to add up his points for the day."
4,"Wonderful Information, horrible sound quality","I love this CD. I think Glasser is approachable and easy to listen to. He has a tendency to ramble a bit, but that adds to his charm. The information is invaluable, and I got a lot out of listening to it and to learning from his words.My only reason for giving this CD a 4 out of 5 stars is because the sound quality makes it sound like it was done on a tape deck in a big room. I have to turn my stereo up loud and fade the speakers to just one side. I listened to it mostly in my car, but it was just as bad in the home system. I think for $30 they could give a better sound product."
5,I keep buying these books and they keep disappearing,"This is an excellent book and a great parenting program. Howie definitely has the right idea. This works and works well, but both parents or grandparents have to be on the same page."
4,a must read for your children's education,"It's a very good book to read. The advice given is very balanced and very effective.The methodology seams a little overwhelming at first, but once applied is easy to follow."
2,talks to much.,I got it thinking it was the audio book. to my surprise it was a recording of a seminar by the author. but in the first cd is just talk and talk. no actual steps to follow. I read part of the book and I liked it. I just haven't had the chance to finish it. but I would preffer an audio book of the book itself. I would recommend the book better than this cd.
5,Worth your time and money!,"This book is so simple to understand and easy to apply to any child. I have recommended this book to anyone who will listen. When I try to explain the book and how easy it is to ""flip"" your power, I always get comments like ""how's that working for ya?"" with a smirk. Later the same parent will ask me privately what the name of the book is and where I got it. I wish schools would use this technique, I wish everyone would use this technique. It has changed the way we parent and the way our children react. We have several diagnosis that need additional help with adhd, odd, anxiety disorder, etc. BUT the book has helped the most at home where we were at our wits end."
3,Don't call us Ambulance Drivers...,"What most people don't understand is that most ""Ambulance Drivers"" are in fact EMT's themselves and that we all can take turns driving and treating patients. Please, please, please, please, PLEASE don't call us ""Ambulance Drivers,"" we may have to hit you."
2,too simple for us,While it is a cute concept I did not feel like it gave my son any contrast between homeschool and going to school. I saw another review about it being too religious. I did not get that at all - yes we are religious but did not feel the book pushed that agenda in any way.I see other books out there and will try those...I feel the story left a lot to be desired for us.
1,Buyer Beware!,"This is not, as I thought, Ponniah's database design book updated to include how one uses the Visible Analyst software for tasks leading up to and including database design. Rather, it is Ponniah's existing database design book (ISBN: 0471218774) PLUS the student edition of the Visible Analyst software.So save your money. First, Ponniah's book is rather pricey. You can do just as well, if not better, with several other lower-priced database design books (e.g. Fleming and von Halle, Halpin, etc.). Second, the version of Visible Analyst packaged with the book is outdated. You can probably contact Visible and get an updated version, and get it for free."
4,Classic John Masters,"It has all the John Masters signatures. Smells divine and small in potion but it do the job with a small. This is kind of oily so I try not to use much. But it has nice texture to it, and easy to apply. Wish it cost bit less for this small size."
5,My favorite strings.,"These are just good strings. The new packaging makes them even better. Sure there are ""better"" strings made from other materials or by a different process but these are a standard for the industry. I have three stratocasters and a les paul. I put these strings on all of them. To my ears they make the guitars sound exactly like they are supposed to. They also are a good value."
5,Ideal Album To Play In A Coffeehouse!,"After 25 Top 40 hits on the Billboard pop charts from 1975 to 1983, Barry decided to change pace with this album. He states that this is the album why he got into the music business in the first place. As a fan of jazz, this is a well-constructed album even if it did not sell as expected.Sarah Vaughan, Gerry Mulligan, among others are featured in this album. I always enjoyed listening to Sarah's music and she does a great job with Barry.If you bought ""Ultimate Manilow"" and enjoyed ""As October Goes"", then you will like this album. As stated in my title, if I owned a coffehouse I would make sure I have this album along with Sarah's box set! Essential for all Barry and/or jazz music fans!"
3,he's back and I'm glad,"I first saw Barry when I was 16 or 17 in high school ,so I did't tell to many people I liked him but I have most of his album's from back than and now I 'm buying his C D s again so thats how good he is and has been. There is no one like him today and no one in the 70's , his music stands out cos its good and it has it's own beat and everyone can feel it who has a heart beat and if one of many songs don't touch you than your heart is not working right. Barry is one of the few singer's that has been around because he is good , and his music is good and its that simple"""""" I m not afraid to say that I m a fan now and I will always be a fan Thank you Barry from a fan tony"
4,"The best of Manilow, none of that dum, dum, dum, dum stuff","When you're down, feeling blue, your woman has left you, and you feel terrible, listen to this and it'll make you damned near suicidal."
5,The greatest CD I own,"I just can't get enough of this wonderful CD.I can throw this in when I stuck in traffic and it just takes me away.I can't believe I found this gem which is soon to be a classic.Buy it and enjoy, you won't regret it."
5,GREAT CD,"I've been a Barry Manilow fan for a lot of years. I heard this music when it was out on Tape back in the early 80's and it was great! I have been searching for it on CD ever since CDs got to be very popular.... and I finally found it. This is a truely unique Barry Manilow CD; some of his best work ever.When you put this CD on and listen to it, you just get that feeling that you're in a smokey jazz bar at 2:00 AM. I love this CD."
2,The Big House of Inverness,Disappointing after the Irish RM series. Book was also printed in microscopic text size which made it very difficult to read.
5,"Beautiful, emotional, filled with hope and love","This is a beautifully written book. It made me cry and it filled me with hope. It helps a reader see the wonders of a sovereign God who loves us all. The author perfectly reveals the agony that accompanies the disease of alcoholism, but this is a story that goes far beyond addiction. Don't miss this book. It is a cut above."
5,Excellent read and a GREAT choice for book clubs,"Beautifully written and so timely a topic, Robin Lee Hatcher has again woven a story with characters so vibrant and real that you'll find yourself wondering about them long after the last page is read. Alcoholism is an addiction I've not personally dealt with in my life, but I've struggled with other addictions. In the pages of Beyond the Shadows, I found comfort and a much needed challenge to draw closer to the only source of lasting peace and to the One who can fill the emptiness inside that an addiction never will. Beyond the Shadows is also a great choice for book clubs, as it has an excellent discussion guide included in the back."
5,Not just about alcoholism,"I worried before reading this book, as I have read only Robin's ""Coming to America Series."" I wondered if the book might feel preachy or have too much Scripture to wade through. I finished the book so quickly, my worries were forgotten! Deborah Haskin's trials and emotions belong to us all. So, too, do the observations and opinions of family and friends, as Robin Lee Hatcher interjects throughout ""Beyond the Shadows."" It was easy to identify with Deborah as she found new love, making her way through the grief of losing her husband. Her pain and disillusion were very real as she came to grips with Gideon's alcoholism. And there is something universal about the temptation to pull away from one's faith.Robin Lee Hatcher's books take me to a place of peace and contemplation. ""Beyond the Shadows"" lives up to that expectation, and I'll never again worry before reading one of her books."
3,More Than Used,"I am a fan of Robin Lee Hatcher, so I am always looking for a good buy on her books. I found one! I love that you can get used books through Amazon and booksellers, however, I like an accurate despcription of what I am getting. ""Beyond the Shadows"" was a little more than ""used"". It was VERY used, it was a library book, was marked, poorly laminated, and had old bar codes still on it. I would have liked to know that I was getting a library copy. I didn't think the seller gave an accurate description on the product and thought the condition of the book should have been better noted."
2,Book dated 1907 (the year 1907),"OK, I should have looked over the few ""Look inside"" pages but I didn't think for one moment that this would be a historical book on history. Interesting I suppose to see how history was seen at the beginning of last century but I think we know more today from research and can learn more from a modern perspective."
1,Yikes!,This was probably one of the worst written books I've ever had the misfortune to read. My husband and I couldn't even finish it.
3,Too short,"I thought it was long enough, but it wasn't . It didn't reach from the living room to my bedroom."
3,gave me some extra energy,This seems over priced. I did the first part and if anything I believe it gave me some extra energy. wheather or not it actually cleanses out some parasites who knows because most parasites are not visible. But doing cleanses are helpful I think because most of us dont eat properly.
3,Does it do anything?,"I've not noticed any effect of this one way or the other. I think my appetite increased a bit, while I was using this. Otherwise it was a waste of money for me. Perhaps there was nothing this product could do for me."
3,Half month supply only,This product only comes with half of whats needed for the full strenth one month treatment
3,Misleading promotion,"The product seems to work well, but note that one purchase is only good for one-half a treatment, making the product cost TWICE its advertised price."
4,Love This Product But........,"I love this product, but I wished they would tell the exact measurements of each ingredient. They have all the good stuff needed to get the parasites out Black Walnut, Clover Seed, Wormwood leaf. That was the main reason I bought their cleanse. So on day 2.... a worm was expelled. I do the cleanse plus a water enema. This has really helped to get all the bad stuff out. I only saw 1 worm plus a few bug looking things...... My tummy is now flat as a pancake and my energy level has not really changed...If anything I am more tired, but I think it is because my body is going deep with trying to cleanse itself. A good cleanse takes your energy 1st and then a few days in you gain energy. Overall, for my 1st parasite cleanse it was ok. But I know for my 2nd and 3rd, I plan to go a little deeper with only the ingredients listed above."
3,comments on the book,This book was very predictable in the beginning you alawys could tell that it was going to work out well in the end and that the two would go through a great jorney. Towards the middle of the book it got less predictable and more adverturous. Exciting things statred to happen and the two children faced a couple of setbacks. At the end of the book it returned to being predictable again and it is obvious to the reader that the children will be safe at the end.
5,This was a great book!!!!!,"I think this would be a good book for fourthgrade classes studying fronteir times.because it gives lots of good informationIf your studying native americans, I do notrecomend it, because it talks harshley aboutthem.My favorite part was when pa came and thefamily was reunited except ma and because itwas a happy ending."
2,Save Queen of Sheba was a dull book!,"Save Queen of Sheba is a somewhat exciting book. It has an odd plot but decent. King David is stranded after Indians ambush his party train. King David is stuck with his very STUBBORN, ANNOYING 5 year old little sister trying to survive and get to Fort Laramie where his parents might be. King David gets lucky with finding a horse and gun. Now this book has no exciting twists and is not very interesting. It is worth reading but only if you have to. I have read much better books than this one. The climax only lasted about two pages and ends the way you think it will. They must survive harsh weather conditions, and they must find food and water.(...)"
3,Dull,Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be bored out of your mind. Well read this book and find out. At the starting it sounds pretty exciting towards the middle you suffer SBD (severe boredom disease). At the ending the author find a cheap way to end the book before the editor's deadline.
3,Product not what discribed,"The title/desription on the web page says that this bike is a 26-inch Men's bike. Unfortunately, it is a women's bike. Now my 12 year old son has a women's bike. I tried to return/replace the product, but every option assumed it was my error and wanted me to pay return postage which would have been half the cost of the bike. I need to buy a new one for my son, but I'm not sure I can trust the information on your website and take that risk.This review need not be posted, but a change in the website and some personal satisfaction to me would be fair. I like your website, but things like this could cause negative feeling and the loss of a good consumer. Please help repair the damage. Thank You."
3,Received a women's bike from amazon,"Same to the prior post. Got a women's bike, brave enough to ride it. Front stem seems a loose design, not adjustable, which makes the bike hard to control. You could not let it go without holding the handle."
2,rear derialleur problem,"I ride this bike for a few weeks now. I have trouble shift the rear derialleur to the lowest gear. The rear derialleur does not match with the freewheel, it cannot handle the 28 Tooth sprocket."
5,Be prepared,Quality product. If you plan on installing yourself make sure you have enough room to mount it. If you have a basic understanding of wiring you can do it. Have a few tools around and you will do fine. I had the wiring set up from the previous unit so if you are wiring from scratch it may take a minute. This unit needs to be plugged in so I had to run a new electrical box as well as reroute a PVC exhaust pipe for my furnace. Be prepared to do a few other things in order for this to work. Good luck.
1,Out of the box and defective?,"I got this humidifier, since I'm having a new baby I wanted to have this item very soon, so I got it on time, I contracted a qualified tech to install it, for my surprise, it didn't work. He went a extra mile trying to find the reason why it wasn't working, he find that the solenoid valve ( the valve that send the water up to the grid) wasn't functioning.Having this unit installed, I decided to contact the seller directly, they try to help me getting Honeywell involve, Honeywell customer support is horrible, they wanted me to test the humidifier, checking voltage and other tech info, I'm not a HAVC technician ????After a few days waiting and my baby is almost here I decided to return the whole item and buy a diferent brand name."
3,Furnance Humidifier,"Its an easy install and an easy hookup if your water source is close by. I had read that the unit does poorly in a 4000sq/ft house, it is rated to 4200 sq/ft. My house is only 2200 sq/ft and I'm running the humidifier full on during the heat cycle. It humidifies to 55% on my hygrometer while heat is on, drops back to 50% when heat is off. We are now entering spring, so heat is not on a high percentage of the time, so humidity may go higher in the dead of winter and need to be controlled by the humidistdat. I do think it will not work well in a large house. There may be some improvement if you use a sail-switch, humidifer is on during the full blower cycle. Just the design it self, drawing air in through the pad and exhausting back into the plenum has it limits."
1,control board issues,I specifically got this unit because it was the more expensive one among the ones I was comparing. Worked great for about a month and then the main control board went bad. Got the replacement board and everything worked well for the rest of the winter months. Now after one month of use this year the unit is dead again. Extreeeeemly disapointed to say the least.
1,Not durable,I bought this unit 5 yrs.ago.I have installed 1 fan motor and main board both had burnt out . My next humidifier will be an Aprilaire which is more durable.This product is not worth the money or time installing.
4,Honeywell Humidifer,"Very decent humidifier. I installed the complete package myself without difficulty using basic home maintenance tools. Instructions were clear enough. I like the fact that it provides fresh water constantly versus a tank with a spinning foam roller. The unit has a fan that blows heated air through the damp filter - forcing humid air into the ducts vs. allowing normal duct air to push through a foam filter. One drawback: the screen filter will clog, especially if you have hard water, and the humidifier will drip externally. I check every few days and have spare filters. So far, have only had to change the filter about once a year.I would purchase this unit again and recommend it."
3,Humidifier,"I purchased this humidifier to replace the same model that had worn fan bearings. The fan bearings are not accessable for lubrication. It was slightly more expensive to purchase a new unit than to buy a replacement motor at a cost of $150.00, (parts only), for a repair.The humidifier does a good job of humidifing the house when the pads a maintained."
4,Big improvement on my previous furnace humidifier,"This unit is an industrial-strength humidifier. My old one, also a Honeywell model, moved the humidified air right back into the furnace, where it was simply dried out all over again. This unit forces the air back into the output duct. Despite what the ads say, you don't need to order a humidistat. It comes with a saddle tap and humidistat. You will need some 1/4"" tubing (copper is best) and necessary fittings. I would also suggest ordering a sail switch (Honeywell S688 Sail Switch) and save yourself from having to mess around with the furnace wiring. I am using an outlet near the furnace to power it, and it is controlled in series by the humidistat and sail switch. No need to figure out out to get switched 110VAC to the unit. The installation instructions are pathetic, though -- especially the wiring instructions. Otherwise I would have rated the product with 5 stars."
2,Disappointing performance,"I've had the unit in operation for about 3 weeks, with minimal impact on the humidity level in my house. Based on the size of the house, this unit should be more than adequate. However, using the humidistat as an indicator, the humidity level (the point at which the humidistat energizes the humidifier) is unchanged. The unit is operational, the filter is installed as instructed, and water flows from the drain, so I'm not sure why the poor performance."
4,Honeywell HE360A Whole House Powered Humidifier,I wanted the humidifier to run any time the blower was on and decided to use a current sensing switch for an additional $35. Very simple to install. Be carefull using the template - check hight vs width.
1,Works OK but not even as well as room humidifiers,"We also got tired of filling room humidifeiers and had this one installed into our forced air system. I have digital humudity meter in the house and with the Honeywell set to 60% we only get up to 33% in the winter. The house without the humidifier was around 25% humidity. We had a different system in our old house and when we turned that up to 60% it would fog the windows. The old system was an Aprilaire, but it was also a diferent type that got installed on the exhaust side of the furnace, the Honeywell installs in the ductwork before the furnace. I even ran hot water from the water heater to the Honeywell hoping it would evaporate faster, but I didn't see any changes in the humidity. If I had to do it over I would buy a unit that mounts on the exhaust side again. In the meantime I am back to running room humidifiers in the kids rooms."
3,Not Good for THTR 101 Class,"I bought this DVD with the intention of showing it to my Theatre 101 class thinking it would be good for them to see how musicals are created. I wasn't a fan of this DVD though for that purpose. If you teach a class strictly on writing, producing, workshopping, etc. a show particularly a musical than this may be the DVD for you. I intend to keep this DVD for future use, because it really is a good DVD for any Theatre Instructor out there that likes to use media for their classes. So, if you're a Theatre 101 teacher and are wanting something more about History of Musical Theatre I would recommend you purchase ""Broadway the America Musical"" DVD set. I wish we could give half stars because in reality I would give this 3 1/2. It's a good DVD to have for you collection, it's just nothing what I thought it was and I'm sorry but the other reviews weren't that great when I decided to purchase this DVD. I hope my review has helped you in some way."
5,Fascinating look at the creation of a broadway musical,"Very informative, entertaining and enlightening film. Explores 4 shows fromtheri inception to production. Insightful. The extras are fun also especially when Harvey Fierstein is talking to people of the TKTS line and they have no idea who he is.We saw Avenue Q when it was on 14th Street and felt it wuld be the success it turned out to be.If you have any interst in the Broadway musical theater get this DVD."
4,Risk and Reward,"Very good account of the risks in producing an economic success in the Broadway Musical Theater. As we might guess, the creators of this documentary give us no magic formula for winning the game. Nonetheless, the account lets you cheer and jeer the contestants with appropriate background for later discussion with similar-minded folk.Not being a Boy George fan, I didn't find this portion particularly enchanting. But, your mileage may vary."
4,Behind The Scenes,"I love ""behind the scenes"" material. This DVD has many. It especially appealed to me because I was at the Tony Awards that year and saw the results in person, so it was very interesting to learn how it all came to be successful."
2,Show Business - The Road to Broadway - Disappointed,"Frankly, I was disappointed in the DVD. What was advertised wasn't what it delivered. I expected to see and hear actual performances instead of listening to people talking over any reminance of a performance."
2,"This book has a beginning and end, but no middle","Many novels have twists and turns, Liars Market by Taylor Smith has maybe one twist and one turn. The plot has an intriguing premise, with three unrelated events tied together. The opening sizzles with a beautiful woman thrown from a balcony in Hong Kong. The chapters also set up the plot quickly, with wife of CIA operations chief Carrie McNeil being interviewed after her husband Drum has disappeared.This novel runs at 370 pages yet the action could have been boiled down to about 100. Nothing really happens. Smith does a good job establishing the few characters there are in this novel, perhaps too good. Many pages ramble on and on about day to day activities of Carrie and her son Jonah and their life. Sure, the ending has some action and few ""twists"". But absolutely nothing happens before that. This book has a beginning and an end but no middle. I recommend this book to no one."
1,Too long for nothing,"I found that this book had a promising start, but then fizzled. It just dragged on for too long with nothing to show for it. I considered putting it down a few times, but continued reading since I had already invested the time. Also, the very end is extremely bland. I would NOT recommend it."
4,Being a purist,"I must write about a major faux pas in this book. As the first character in the book was celebrating her 35 b-day in 2001 this makes her born in 1966 and 1966 is NOT a year of the dragon, as stated in the book, it is a year of the horse. Beyond that I enjoy this book thought it was well written. 'Though I did know ""who dunnit"" before the end. The character's could have grown a little more, the lead female was strong but tended toward self abuse. It raced along pleasantly with some subtle twists and turns."
3,"Talented Musician with a few gems, but sterile production","This track has two great songs, which are tracks #2 and #15. The rest of the able sounds like some sort of radiohead parody crossed with the RHCP. Which means I don't necessarily think this a ""classic"" frusciante album. If anything, ""shadows collide with people"" is John Frusciante's equivalent to Eric Clapton's ""Backless."" In other words, average filler music after a classic solo comeback; frusciante with 2001's ""To Record Only Water For 10 Days"" and Clapton with ""Slowhand."" Buy it if your a die-hard fan only."
3,shadows collide with people,"if you like john frusciante,you may also like john doe,joy division,depeche mode,the smiths,talking heads,frank zappa,hayden,boards of canada,cracker."
2,Pop Crap With A LOT Of Filler,"John Frusciante is best known for his ability to create touching peices of music using the guitar. This album is nothing but pop crap with corny lyrics and dull strumming backed by electronice beeps and bops. Two OK songs: ""Carvel"" and ""Song To Sing When I'm Lonely"". To hear John at his best pick up the album TO RECORD ONLY WATER FOR TEN DAYS. Almost every song on that album is truely genius (see ""Rampart"" and ""Murderers""). To Record Water For Only Ten Days is so good that when people heard Shadows they made themselves believe it is good even though it is not."
4,'50's harmonies and spooky drum machines...nail on the head,"Frusciante has succeeded in releasing an album which feels like a more artistic ""by the way"", in which the chili peppers should rename their group to 'John Frusciante and the hot three'. More seriously though...It's a work of art that has 50's harmonies with spooky drum machine tracks. ""Carvel"" is a real gem as it opens the cd with a feel of psychadelic beach boys. Songs like ""I regret"" and ""Ricky"" feel like it should be 3 am drinking white wine feeling happy. John has succeeded in producing an album that has outdone ""To Record Only Water For Ten Days""..."
2,Disappointing!,"Wow, I've been a Frusciante fan for so long, and this album really let me down. As someone who has preferred John's solo work over the Chili Peppers through the years--even if an album yielded only one or two listenable tracks (e.g., Smile From The Streets That You Hold)--many of these new songs sound bland and uninteresting to me. For one thing, the production is completely different. Where previous albums were recorded entirely by John on home-recording equipment, this album was engineered in a studio, with live drums and more of a standard band sound. Sadly, the music in this format sounds homogenized and very average, including most of the guitar-work, strangely. The strength of the songwriting is undone by too much production--a striking contrast from the minimalism of prior albums."
5,----------------==--------------------=,"most people i know who hear johns first two albums are appalled and offended, usually refering in some way to a dying cat. or a man with his weiner slammed in a car door... i dont understand where theyre coming from those two records have remained two of my favorites, niandra for almost ten years, and smile for atleast six.. as a guitar player AND a singer there really isnt anyone in the same room with him. Smile From the streets you hold was a document from the bowels of heroin addiction with similar depth and bile as william burroughs' naked lunch.... and now john is clean his two albums since getting sober glow with the same elusive peace and gratitude that his first two could only shiver in the corner and dream about so few of us are pulled from those gates of insanity and death im so glad that today john is among them...."
4,Sweet sounds from a nice guy who's been through hell.,"A really enchanting piece of music. I wish all his songs were produced at this level. So many diamonds in the rough ...left unpolished and unheard. If he were to use his money and talent to make his music more listenable by proper finishing - he'd be bigger than the Beatles. As it is, the starkness of his production makes it seem as if he's a home studio wannabee with potential. Sad. His music could bring joy to so many people - but they'll never get past its ""garage band"" appearance. Sad. John share please."
4,"""ON SECOND THOUGHT""","i purchased this album when it first came out, i played it 4 or 5 times trying to get into it, but i couldn't... needless to say i was disapointed (at that point i would have given it a 1 star rating).after listening to ""Ataxia I"", ""the will to death"", ""dc ep"", ""curtains"" and ""inside of emptiness""; i was so blown away that i was left wanting more from Frusciante... so i revisited Shadows Collide With People, and only then was i able to see what John was trying to accomplish with this album. <<this is actually an outstanding album that was ruined by over-production and the fact that Flea and Chad both contributed on this album giving it a RHCP feel>>. i think if John were to revisit this album he could do a much better job and it would be the best of his solo projects. he just needs to losen the production and leave flea and chad in L.A.4 stars because he allowed his creative passion to be overwhelmed by over-production and loyalties to the RHCP otherwise would have been 5."
3,"Some great pop songs, but John is capable of much more","Really, it sounds nice, the production's terrific, John's vocals are sounding better than ever. However something's missing here. Maybe I'm dissapointed because Im a guitarist and I was hoping for some of John's insanely beautiful guitar solos. Or maybe I just didn't feel the passion or originality on this album that I had felt when listening to Niandra Lades. I personally feel that Niandra is ten times deeper and better than this album. SCWP just sounds too polished for my tastes. I love John. He's one of my heros, and one of the best guitarists alive I think. I just felt that he downplayed his capabilities as a guitarist on this record. But whatever, he'll keep making great music so Im not worried. This album however, I could take it or leave it."
5,Stupendously Mystifying,"A beautiful album. So raw, deep, and from the heart. A true talent. I hope you are well. It is a hellish world at moment, but this is a heaven - if we make it so."
3,"Yeah, a real candyland...","...uh...for the mind. Or in this the the ears. The textures are perfect, and John's voice more accessable that it has ever been. Also worth noting about this album is that on Frusciante's website demos and acoustic takes of these tracks are available for download. The beauty of these songs shine just as well, in their stripped down form.Rock on John!"
4,This is the J Fru solo CD with which to start,"""Shadows Collide With People"" is the first CD Frusciante did solo while being clean, I believe. It's also the best produced, and most accessible of his solo works. After listening to this I can clearly hear the Frusciante influence in every subsequent RHCP release. The Chilis used to be Kiedis and Flea's band---now they are definitely Frusicante's band. I like this CD. I think if it had been pushed there are definitely radio friendly songs there. Buy this one first, and if you like it you should try his other solo works. Just be warned, some of them (Niandra Lades, especially) are pretty weird.Another reviewer compared John Frusciante to Brian Wilson. I believe that is an accurate comparison. One day, people will look back at JF's solo work and wonder why more people didn't ""get it"". Brilliant musician, brilliant songwriter, genius in the studio. Buy this CD, buy all his other CDs, buy all the RCHP albums, too."
4,rocket launcher,"My 6 year old really loves this toy. Close supervision is needed for safety as the rocket launches with a lot of force. It really goes up high which is very exciting. As long as the launcher is level (as it should be) the rocket will come down close to where it is launched and lands safely- it wouldn't hurt you if it bumped into you and it is easy enough to move out of the way any way. If the plastic tube is not connected just right, you will not be able to pump it up to full pressure and therefore, the rocket won't launch as high."
4,A very well researched piece of historical fiction,"I very much enjoyed this novel. It starts off a bit slow, but then careens forward into an amazing epic that spans from the early '30s to end of the second world war.The characters and storytelling are quite good, but Furst's true talent is compellingly recreate the tense atmosphere of wartime Europe. He frequently drops in lovely asides about the culture, history and eccentricities of the regions he uses as the backdrop for his story.I came away feeling like I know more about the Balkans and the Spanish Civil war than ever I learned in school.Other reviewers have commented on the abruptness of his finish, and I admit the book would have probably been better at 800 pages than 500. That's hardly a criticism for a writer as good as Furst.A delightful spy novel with excellent historical chops. It was a lovely journey."
2,after reading his book about spies in pre ww2 salonika...,i found this story a bit confusing and wandering. I was disappointed. Not sure if I can recall actually finishing the last 20pp or so that was how memorable my experience.
4,Another wonderful WWII novel by Furst,"Liked this book a lot.In some ways -- in trying to cover so muchGround- this Alan Furst was not as good aThriller as others. It sprawled from BulgariaTo Moscow to Spain,Paris and back to RussiaAnd it also sprawled in time. 1933 to 1945.But as always in Furst's books we are swept upIn the tragedy,waste, and heroism of the period."
2,Tedious Furst novel,This is the first tedious novel by Alan Furst. Am half way through and cannot seem to toil through the book. Have read all his other books.
2,Night Soldiers disappointing with no historical value,"Long, rambling, laborious read without expected historical value. Writer seems to have lost direction at times. Did not have excitement and intrigue of previous works"
2,Condition of book,The physical condition of the book was terrible. The description given by the previous ownerwas not accurate. It is readable but seems on the verge of falling apart.
4,Bread Crumbs,"When I finished this book I came very close to returning to page one and starting over. Not because the book was extremely readable, but because I felt that I never quite had the time-line and all the characters sorted out properly. Mr. Furst is a wordsmith of the highest order and he quickly reels you in. Maybe that's the reason I lost my way at times -- I just kept reading without understanding all that was being presented to me.If you decide to read this book, drop a few bread crumbs along the way. You will thank me later."
4,Night Soldiers,"Exciting but terrible. Not the book, but what happened to the people in the book. The names threw me, trying to keep up with the characters. Alan was able to paint a dark picture of the little people who lived life in the shadow of the Nazi and the Russian horror's of WW2. I will read it again, now that I have seen the whole picture unfold. Scary horrible moments were shared with the character's of this dark period of history. I look forward to reading otherbooks by Alan Furst."
5,Put me down as a new Furst fan,"I'm a pretty avid reader and a history fan to boot. So I was almost surprised to ""discover"" Alan Furst as a writer recently, but a very happy surprise indeed. I've now read Night Soldiers and Dark Star, and have a couple more of his novels downloaded for later. If you want a good read AND an intimate feel for Europe in the late 1930s, on the eve of WWII, I highly recommend this book. Furst has a great sense of description, a talent for letting you actually picture and feel what the people and places - Moscow, Madrid, Paris, and lots of villages in between - were really like in 1936-1938."
4,Historical Novel About Eastern Europe From Pre WWII to the end of The War,"The author writes very authoritatively and realisticially about events leading up to WWII beginning in 1934 and continuing till the end of the war. The main character was Khristo Stoianev, a young Bulgarian whose younger brother was murdered by a group of local fascists. Khristo was recruited into the NKVD and subsequently sent to Spain as an agent. He began to become disillusioned with Soviet politics and moved to Paris to try to live a normal life as a waiter. But, once involved in espionage it's not easy to break away. He was imprisioned as a result of a purge. But released by a Priest. He was thus free to return to his homeland and attempt along the way to cause problems for both the Germans and Russians. The key message I got from the interesting read was how the original idealism faded away with reality. A worthwhile read."
3,A bit disconnected,"Am a fan of Ken Follett books for light reading and thought I would like this. I found the character development lacking and that it jumped around too much. I would read a passage and wonder what the point of it was, or if I misunderstood who was whacked and why. Some parts were quite good, but overall I found it disconnected. Ended up stopping 1/2 way through and I rarely do that."
3,Hugely Disappointing,"I read this book after Kingdom of Shadows. I was hugely disappointed. The book falls down in the way in deals with the NKVD. No espirit de corps, no belief in a larger mission. Furst doesn't have the same knowledge of Bulgaria that he does of France, Hungary or Poland. What makes Stoianev a Bulgarian? This is never clear he is simply a slav. Also the love scnes and the romantic relationship have been done before by Alan Furst.All in all Overambitious, tries to cover too much ground, too many characters and the characters are flat."
3,"good, but too long.","Another good espionnage book by Furst. The only real flaw with the book is its length. If you are anything like me, you'll get the feeling that Furst is trying to make a long novel for the sake of it being long. The last hundred pages or so are kind of useless and the book ends up being a chore to read through. Otherwise, the book is really nice and once again Mr. Furst creates a nive gallery of believable characters and events. The atmosphere is just great. Had the book had been shorter, it would rate a solid 4 stars, maybe even 5. His shorter books (like the Polish Officer or Blood of Victory)are better."
4,"Dark,somber world","I am very fond of the dark, somber world that Alan Furst so brilliantly portrays. As a matter of fact I grew up in former Yugoslavia and visited some of the places described in this book. Mr.Furst has an amazing gift. You can almost smell the dark night in a small Bulgarian town by the Danube, or the reckless ,fear induced,abandon in the pre-war Paris.Except couple of fairly minor mistakes the painstaking research paid off. I am going to read the rest of Mr.Furst books in the near future."
5,Magnificent,"""Night Soldiers"" grabs you on the first page and just doesn't let go. The characters are multi-dimensional, flesh-and-blood humans who stay with you long after you turn the last page. Furst's plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, heart pounding, but he never lets you forget that this war was like all wars in important ways - it was full of sorrow and grief; chaos, absurdity, and random tiny moments of kindness. This is a thriller for adults who love great literature."
2,Not as good as Night Soldiers.,"Alan Furst's turf is ""Mittel Europa"" and he clearly knowsa lot about the politics and cultures of the region. His""Night Soldiers,"" placed believable characters in absorbingsettings and circumstances. The same grasp of the Balkanand Russian backgroundsis evident here, but the characters are not as interesting,many who could be interesting are left hanging here andthere, and there basically is no plot, just a central characterwho is not particularly convincing and suffering through a long string ofevents, mainly of the narrow escape variety. Too bad."
2,A hard read,"I have read every one of the Ludlum novels, which are long and involved but ultimately interesting. I found this book to be very difficult to read. There were many scenes in which new characters were introduced and not tied in to the story of the protagonist until far later. I'm not a student of history, and could barely keep up with the historical framework. I read the entire book, but wished that I had put it down (which I NEVER do) before wasting so much time on it. There are far better character studies that are enjoyable to read. I much preferred the Furst novels written before this one.If you begin reading and are having difficulty, put it down - it doesn't get any better!"
2,painful,"I have blown through dozens of books this year on my kindle, but I just can't get into this one. It is slow.. and its often difficult to keep track of what is going on. Maybe I'm just not pretentious enough to enjoy it."
2,Espionage? Where?,"Maybe I'm not as sophisticated a reader as some of the 5-star review readers, but this book just didn't do it for me. I was expecting a good spy novel during WWII, but, as it turns out, this was just a book about a guy who was trained to be a Soviet spy that didn't really do much spying. The most exciting part of the book for me was the training the main character went through. As another reviewer said, I was relieved to have finally finished the book."
2,A Disapointing Read,"Based on the good reviews from Amazon readers, I was really looking forward to this novel. Unfortunately, it is very long winded and boring. I resorted to skimming the text just to get through with the book."
2,Never finished it,"[...].This is a work of fiction, which is usually required to grasp the reader so that he actually cares whether or not our hero lives or dies. In this case, on page 176 of 435, I'm voting for death all the way around. The characters in the book are Commie pinko bastards one and all. I may try and finish this book, but probably not. I didn't try, I took it back. This is one of three books I didn't finish in my lifetime. The first was War and Peace, again I didn't like the characters in the novel. I disliked the person that ""our hero"" was becoming.I like the way that Alan Furst writes, in this case I intensely disliked his subject. That's why it got up to a 2."
1,Insrtuctions?,"This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem. The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it. The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all. It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it."
1,Garbage,"I bought this to tune my HAM radio antenna. The instructions were more clear than some of the reviews indicated, so the operation was easier than I expected.I had this hooked up to an 85 watt, mobile radio and during the tuning process the meter started smoking. The meter is supposed to be able to handle 100 watts so I know I didn't have too much power going through it. I also double checked to connections and they were correct.I don't know if the problem was this specific unit or the whole product line, but what I do know is you get what you pay for. Next time I'll go to a 2-way radio store and buy something after talking to the store clerks."
2,Not that good,"For twice what I paid for this meter I got one 100 times better. The instructions are a total joke so you dont really know what your doing. The power reading changes with swr. So if you have a 1.5 swr it will show a higher power than if you have a 1.2 swr. But I will say the swr reads close to that of better meters. This only reads an average power so you could use it to set deadkey but your better off finding a radioshack swr/power meter, 100 times better"
4,We share in the guilt,"Both Japan and the US eat whales. The US allows the northern Alaskan Indians to hunt, kill, and eat the whales. It's allowed due to tradition over the years. The Japanese feel the same way, they have been killing whales for thousands of years. I would prefer the US to take the lead and stop all whale killing so they can say from the high mountain that killing whales is bad."
3,Misleading Title,"This set is mostly newsreel footage of various battles and campaigns of WW2, with an emphasis on North Africa and western Europe. There are occasional insights into the various leaders, but not many. One of the bonus features deals with Vietnam-era events. Finally, in my copy DVDs 4 and 5 had their labels swapped (i.e., the DVD labelled ""4"" had the content that should have been on DVD 5, and vice versa)."
5,Perfect for bug-fascinated new readers,"My kindergarten-age grandson is crazy about all kinds of insects, animals, and fish. He was able to read this book with little help and continues to enjoy the story. It's just the right length for young readers and makes reading fun."
1,I Like Bugs Step 1 Reader,GREAT! My 6 year old granddaughter (just turned 6 on Christmas) loves bugs and the book was well received. She is learning to read in Kindergarten and this has been a great help to her.
5,Buggy Book,"This is a wonderful book, with funny illustrations, and easy-to-read text. I bought this book for my daughter, because she has become scared of any and all bugs. I was hoping this book would help her to get over her fear of these interesting creatures. She is only two, but already she can identify bugs outside with the bugs illustrated in this book. This is a great beginner book."
5,"""I Like Bugs"" great for Classroom Use","This is a terrific book to use in the classroom. It is easy and fun to read. The kids all loved it. Use it to extend a lesson on bugs or even adjectives. We wrote our own ""I Like..."" books after reading it. Many of the words come straight from state mandated word lists. This whole series, (Road to Reading) is a wonderful tool for any classroom, but especially the resource room."
2,Poorly chosen font,"I was really disappointed when the books I ordered in this series arrived. They use an interior font that has letters no learning-to-reader would recognized, like stylized ""a"" and ""t"". I think in a book that is for a beginning reader you need the most generic looking font using the most basic looking letter styles for kids who are just putting letters together into words."
5,Great investment,"I bought this book for my son and he absolutely loves it. I bought the paperback version, which he is a little young for. But he carries it with him and loves it when we read it to him. It is a big hit."
3,Doesn't give the bugs names,"My son is 2 1/2 and knows names of species of animals that I only learned as an adult, so I'm always looking for books that give the proper name of each species, objects etc. He loves to read & soaks up info like a sponge, so for me the book just referring to all the different bugs as ""bugs"" is cute maybe for a 1 year old, but I'd prefer the actual names. It's a cute book, just not one of my favorites.I'm a fan of Margaret Wise Brown, and definitely prefer Goodnight Moon, My World and Runaway Bunny, as they are more educational as they entertain. Example, from Runaway Bunny, one of my son's favorites, he knows the difference between a swing and a trapeze, etc."
1,What is This?,It's merely impossible for me to understand the very good rating of this book. This is why sometimes I simply ignore other readers opinion. I've read a lot of very good crime thrilers and this book definitely isn't one.
4,Bright Light for indoor work or emergencies,"We use this for the times our electricity goes off during storms, etc. or for those times you want a bright light to illuminate a work site inside the house or garage."
5,"voices, voices mesmerize","This can also be my favourite Patti Smith record. Although it was judged as a ""egocentric debacle"" i think that it just as wonderful as Horses. Although i do agree that it wasn't the right decision to try to make the group sound comercial. Patti here tries to experiment with the sound. It is very powerful, and it takes all that Patti Smith charisma down into your room. My favourite song is Ain't it strange. It really captures her suggestivness. Patti invites:""come explore me""."
4,I like this cd,I bought this cd new when it came out. I lost it in 1993 when moving. I have wanted it so I bought it. It is a great cd.
1,never even got it to work - big waste of money,What a disappointment - couldn't even get the thing to lift off the ground - propeller turned but no luck flying - didn't have the original box to send it back
1,Ripoff Alert: No Propellors Available,"Neat plane, looks like it would probably be lots of fun, however it came with 3 props that looked too small for the airplane, and plane nosedived on all 3 launches, 3 props busted in 3 minutes. The real kicker? No one, including Megatech, has any replacement props, nor do they expect to, for at least 3 months!Now I'm stuck with this expensive lump of plastic + styrofoam gathering dust in my closet. What a ripoff!"
4,Dated but Realistic,"This solid look at Mayor Richard J. Daley (1902-1976) of Chicago is critical, informative, and realistic. Author Len O'Connor (1912-1991) was a local reporter who covered the local political scene for nearly four decades. Here he begins by covering Daley's youth and steady rise to the top, then his long tenure as mayor (1955-1976) and political leader. O'Connor finds fault with Daley and the corrupt Chicago political machine, yet also acknowledges the man's achievements. This book is often critical of Daley, but it never drops down to a hatchet job. Overall it's a rather realistic look at the politics of the nation's second city.This book came out shortly before Daley's years in office ended with his passing in late 1976. Readers should also consider BOSS by Mike Royko, a more harshly critical but engaging look at the mayor."
3,Sounds like advertising to me.,"Maybe this book is accurate. Maybe.I cannot find any other research studies on this topic, expect thru the ""Endurox"".The author seems to think the only way to deliver his claims is thru a ""sport drink"" ... which he repeated so many times as to put a red flag up for me.I did some research on the web, and found that the author has licensed the ""R4"" formula to the makers of the powered ""Endurox"". Of course, if it is in print, it must be true, right? =)In any case, I would like to see results of a study not associated with the author or the powdered drink maker.I am just a bit skeptical, but if it works, this may be a great thing for all of us."
1,Don't buy this book...,"The author goes on and on about the R4 recovery system, which is patented, of course you will find R4 attached to the name of an athletic recovery drink.I bought this book, but wish I hadn't. It's a very long (and expensive) brochure for a product that I am certain the author has some sort of financial interest in.Nothing too useful in here, nothing brilliant at all."
1,No key code & also part of the box set (Not COD2 as ordered),"I ordered Call of Duty 2. I got Call of Duty 2 Game of the Year version (twice after returning the first one) which is actually part of a larger box set according to the print on the manual. There is no key-code in the manual or on the back of the manuel. I can't play this game at all. I've returned it once for a replacement and I'm going to return this one for the exact same reason: No key-code! This isn't like Amazon.com at all. I'm not rating them, I'm rating this product. You'll find the same review on the Call of Duty 2 (not deluxe or game of year which is what I ordered both times) as well. Really, I have no choice but to return this 2nd game for a refund. I would've liked to play the game but no luck here."
1,Carbon Copies Of Madonna Songs,"There is nothing dance about these tracks, they are carbon copies of Madonna's tracks with no original music inserted. Each track is equally as long as the original Madonna song. Do not waste your money.The remixes on i-tunes are of ""Like A Prayer"" are far superior to this whole 14 track cd."
5,I DID NOT MIND THE WAIT FOR AN EXCELLENT CD,"WHEN I ORDER THE CD IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR OVERNITE SHIPMENT. I FINALLY RECEIVED THE CD AFTER SEVERAL WEEK, BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. THIS CD SHOULD BE TITLE THE BEST OF JIMMY CLIFF.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
1,Serious Problems,"Sophia D. (along with Heather Forbes) includes a chapter on ""Reactive Attachment Disorder"" (RAD), but gives the disorder a different definition than is found in the DSM-IV-TR. The authors rather give RAD the definition used by a fringe group of practitioners -- ""Attachment (Holding) Therapists"" -- which is a catch-all laundry list of signs that would label ANY child as RAD. If this isn't bad enough, the authors then prescribe Holding Therapy, an unvalidated practice denounced as abusive (see the journal *Child Maltreatment* Feb 2006) by APSAC and the APA's Division on Child Maltreatment. Holding Therapy uses hours of coercive restraint and other aversives to mold adoptees into unquestioningly obedient little Stepford Children.The second edition of this book (2010) excises the chapter on RAD, but has other problems, such as the endorsement of EMDR."
5,The method behind the madness!,"Play on words notwithstanding, Dr. Dziegielewski's book provides valuable insight into the ""mindset"" of the DSM-IV-TR.She presents a balanced approach and practicl guide to in-depth applications of diagnostice and therapeutic consideraations for a number of issues found in the DSM-Iv-TR.Dr. D is an expert in this field, frequently holding workshops on how to use the DSM. This book is thorough, logical, practical, and necessary. For even though one may have philosophical differences w/the DSM (and Dr. D addresses these in her book), the DSM is still the ""tool of choice"" for mental health professionals for diagnosis, assessing, and treating clients."
4,Feel you're never in control over your life? Buy this!,"""Organizing from the Inside Out For Teens"" is a wonderful book that teaches teenagers how to organize their life. It features sections on how to organize your personal space (locker,room,study area), and how to organize your time and life. Its very detailed, complete with illustrations, print out scheduales and item lists that would be good for organizing.When I first was givin this book, I had no intention of reading it...but soon my curiosity got the better of me and I began to read it. My life has since greatly improved, I am able to keep my belongings organized and I have control over my life! From this book, Teens can learn great skills that will prove them succesfull in their adult years! I would reccomend this book to anyone is having trouble with organization. 4 Stars!"
3,a homeschooling critic.,"Organizing teens is a great book for those with a heap of homeless items, also for those with tons of junk loaded into every spare cubby!It is not targeted toward those with a great organizing system though. So if you are looking for emergency help this is the perfect life-saver. If you are looking for the best duster to clean your allready imacluate dresser, you had better look somewhere else.E.A.S."
2,Something is Missing...,"Okay, so this book isn't THAT bad, but there are better organization books that take a little longer to implelement but work much better in the long run. I recommend that teenagers should instead read the FlyLady cleaning book and use the control journal idea in conjunction with this book to keep their room clean. They must devise their own system and that takes a lot of time and trial and error, but this book won't solve all of the organization problems, it needs more. Trust me, I am 15, I spend about 10 minutes a day keeping my room neat, and it is always perfect. I also have tons of time for everything I want to do."
2,cute but big,These shoes are cute but I ordered my regular size and they seemed a half size bigger and were very wide.
5,Very good workout,"If you wanna lose weight then this DVD definitely if for you, I probably lost like 20 lbs. in three months from dieting and doing this, I mean that chick is a crazy [...], but that's good cause the workout makes you sweat and is intense when you first do it.. I definitely reccommend buying this cause you will not be disappointed!"
5,Great short stories which later became novels,"If you are interested in Louie, read his short stories first. They will get you hooked!"
1,why not include the original audio?,"1 star for the dvd, 4 stars for the original film. i really enjoyed this film when i saw it in the theatre in its original form. the action is great and jet li is just so fast in this one. then i quite excitedly received the dvd as a gift; excited, that is, until i realized that it didn't contain the original audio. i really don't like dubbing, that ruined it for me. i also realize that i may be in the minority on this, so i can understand wanting to include a dubbed track, but why not include both? i can't even watch this great film now.i couldn't even bring myself to watch the dvd, but if they did a reasonable job, i would definitely recommend this to people who don't mind dubbing. hopefully, though, they'll release a ""special edition"" or something with subtitles, but i'm not holding my breath."
3,Buena Vista wasted this movie,"What the heck's wrong with Buena Vista getting the nerve to rescore, edit (sliced off a small portion of the ending), rewrite, and dub (and terribly dubbed at that) this masterpiece of a cultural film? The least they could have done was include the original version on the DVD. The only thing good about this DVD is the good clarity of the images. Disney needs to get their act together."
1,It a sad day,"A year or so ago a friend of mine took me to see this flik in New York. I was utterly amazed at the richness of the story and the wonderful martial arts sequences. So ofcourse I bought this one as soon as it came out. I must say it is truly amazing that americans can once again take a good movie and with a little dubbing make it an abomination. There are parts that are omitted from the original, certain inflections are missing when dubbed, trash. If you never saw the original release then hey go for it, you may like this movie. But if you saw the original, you'll only cry yourself to sleep with this one."
1,corny,"wow.bruce lee would roll over in his grave.this redo of the bruce lee classic,""chinese connection"",is hardly worth a bag of popcorn.the acting is horrible even by kung fu movie standards.the libertys they took with the storyis criminal.the fight scenes are awful.jet li is a robot.a very fast robot,buta robot none the less.the contrived love triangle between lis' character and thefemale love interest and a japanese soldier martial artist is so bad it is funny.i mean,really funny.stupid movie.don't waste your money unless you enjoy bad(andi mean,really bad)movies.i rated this movie one star out of misguided kindness."
3,The Fist of Legend is one to be reckonded with,"Although I dispise most English dubbed foriegn films,occassionally I make exceptions and Fist of Legend is one of those exceptions.The dubbed voices are a bit goofy,but once you get past it,this is really an awsome film.It's got a good story line,and the fight scenes are EXCELLENT!Jet Li is a BAD MUTHER F^%%#!?*&@!!@$er!There is a little wire work,but it's not over done like other martial arts films.This is a great film,well worth owning and will go well with other great classics like Drunken Master,and Drunken Master 2."
5,Bruce alike film but Jet Li Style !,"No doubt jet li trying very hard to compare this film to bruce lee contain guide amazing fight scene such as the one he fight the japanese master blind fold, and when he storm the temple. I like the scene when he show off excersise 1 hand 3 finger push up etc.. yet not as good as bruce lee he did in 2 finger, but still amazing. Must for Jet Li Fan."
5,Jet Li at his finest!,"An incredible movie by Jet Li! A must have! Li dazzles his audience with the range of styles in martial arts in this action-packed movie. Taking Bruce Lee's original movie, ""Fist of Fury"" aka ""The Chinese Connection"", Li further twist the plot by including Japanese and Chinese politic and inter-nationality romance. Many people try to weigh the pros and cons of both Bruce Lee's classic and Jet Li's remake, but I consider both benchmarks in martial arts movie making. It's interesting (and funny) to watch one and then the other and see how much the story basically remains the same but the way it presented changes through time. But overall, Jet Li's tribute to Bruce Lee's movie ranks one of the best martial arts movie out there. Get it and see it for yourself!"
5,Chan Zen. From Jing Wu? The Best,"He is the best just like he says. Non-stop action, no BS martial arts movie, a true classic."
5,Bruceish,"This movie is formated just like the Bruce Lee origionals. It has wonderful camera work, the fight seens are not for no reason, and it follows a tight plot.This movie is wonderful thanks to Jet Li, Actor and producer."
5,Jet Li is just too cool......,"When you watch this movie, you will know why I rated it as 5 stars. Even for non-action fans, I'm sure that they will be impressed with the excellent choreography and martial art skills displayed in this movie. I only wish that this movie can be released in America because I'm sorry to say, but Lethal Weapon 4 and Black Mask does not do Jet Li any justice. This is by far the best martial arts movie (next to Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II) I have ever seen, and I have seen many good ones. Although the plot seems like a typical martial arts movie (it is Jet Li's tribute to Bruce Lee), there is plenty of second-to-none action scenes to keep you hooked. This is a must see for all martial arts fans and anyone, especially for those who have only seen his American movies!"
1,Dimension [Stinks],"First off, let me say this movie rocks! I am giving this movie one star because Dimension changed it from the original. If you can get a copy of the original (it's not easy. I had a friend ship me one from Hong Kong), you'd realize when Dimension dubbed over the audio with english, they made big changes from the original. This has the overall effect of changing the plot and the ending (they cut footage and changed the ending). The DVD does add huge improvements to the quality of the picture (if all you want is to watch the fighting then get the DVD), but it's not worth the lamer plot (Imagine if Morpeous and Neo were always angry at each other when you switched the language setting over to Spanish). Just so you guys know..."
2,NO CHINESE TRACK!,"What's the deal with no original Chinese track? I HATE movies that don't include the original voices. This is a great martial arts film. Probably one of the best Jet Li perfomances ever but... the voice dubbing bothered me so much I would not want anyone else to buy it.Think about it, it's a chinese martial arts film and they couldn't have included an english subtitle for the chinese track as an option? It's like like watching Star Wars with a French dub and no English version as an option. Now does that sound right?"
2,Jet Li's Best film ruined by English dub!,"I've been waiting for the DVD version of ""Fist of Legend"" for a long time and was disapointed after finally receiving it. This was not the first time I've seen this excellent film. I own the video tape, VCD, and LaserDisc versions of the movie and enjoy watching it over and over. A lot is lost in the translations in the English-Only DVD version and the new soundtrack ruins everything further. With DVD's ability for multiple language tracks, it is apparent that someone got the idea to cut corners to dump this hacked film on the Western audience for a fast buck. My advice... Get the ORIGINAL video, VCD or LD of this great movie if you can find it. You can always rewind back to read the subtitles you missed."
5,Better then Lee's and Yen's,"This is the best Chen Zhen , follower of Huo Yuan Jia, movie out there. Jet Li's boxing style is incredibly suave and adds flavor to a classic story. The acting, kung fu, and choreography are all great - can't say enough about this movie - but others have already laid the pavement.. its great, buy it, love it."
2,"Great movie, horrible DVD","This DVD is very inexpensive, and in this case you get what you pay for.Just by looking at the box and DVD itself you can easily see the lack of quality. The menu is static and completely silent. There are NO special features whatsoever, instead just some crummy advertisements for other Dimension Film DVDs.The biggest problem: NO ORIGINAL AUDIO TRACK. This movie is dubbed, and that's the only way you can watch it.With all that said, the quality of the picture is very good, which is the only redeeming quality of this DVD.This movie needs to be re-released desperately in a more polished product, and definitely bundled with subtitles and the original audio track."
2,Poor production value was a let down,"The production value on this movie was quite poor compared to its HK cousins & that's saying alot? Not only was this film let down by the empty sets, the camerawork made the film seem like it was shot by a home video enthusiast. It also seemed more like a remake of the camp Streetfighter than Fist of fury."
5,I got this for free!!!,"I got this movie for my husband, he loves it. And the best part is I got it for free!!! Really, no joke!!!! Come join me, just copy and paste my link and you can start getting free stuff too.[...]"
2,To the viewer from NY,"To the viewer from New York who didn't like my review.*Please don't try to discredit my opinion*My copy was an official release from Mei Ah LD.*Fist of fury & the Chinese connection are the same film. However, another Bruce Lee film known more widely as the Big Boss is also known as Fists of fury, take note of the plural.*Yes, I was comparing Fist of legend to that Van Damme film.*As for how many HK films I've seen, well I seen enough to form a ""good"" opinion, I also don't have or need to wait for the tranlated version."
2,Over-rated,"This movie has everything you'd expect from Jet Li. That being said, anything not directly in Jet Li's hands is just reaching. As a fan of wuxia films I must tell you that this is the worst of anything from Yuen Woo Ping. Normally I'd say anything with Jet Li and Yuen Woo Ping is a must see but not this one. If you are just looking for epic fight scenes then this movie is great, but considering the prowess of Bruce Lee I'd say that the only things that came close were Jet Li's ability and the fight choreography. Even Fong Sai Yuk is better than this. Watch the original or if you want good Jet Li then buy Tai Chi Master."
1,Not that good of a movie!!!!!,"I just don't understand what the hype is about? First of all its not dubbed in english so you have to read a script at the bottom of your TV screen. Second its just not that good of a movie. their are plenty of other Kung-Fu movies alot better than this one!!!! May I recommend INVINCIBLE ARMOR one of the best Kung-Fu movies ever, and blows this movie away in a heartbeat."
5,"""as good as it gets""","lets see jet li returns home to china to find his master has been poisiend and killed(huh!) somebody(s) gonna get their tales wooped.this is LI'S best, just hand to hand martial arts fighting literly in ever scene.and i mean the good stuff thanks to LI and his incredibele ability and also to the greatest fight choriographer in the business WOO-PING YUEN(iron monkey,matrix etc.)i don't believe i'll ever see any anything any better.the only the out there even close to this(this meaning a martials arts film with realistic fighting and not wire work all the way through)is chan's LEGEND OF THE DRUKEN MASTER.FIST OF LEGEND should go down as a legend,if not the greatest.please make a special edition that includes chinese language with enlish subtitles.the dubbing is kinda poor to the point were its almost funny.GO BUY THIS FILM"
5,Awesome,"One of the best Martial Arts movies I have ever seen. Jet Li displays his talent and demonstrates why he is one of the best martial artists today. The fight scenes are well done and each last a good 5 minutes each. The best part is that there is more then one major fight scene, which evolves Li. Most of the time there is the huge battle between the hero and villain at the end. This is not the case with this movie. Rent it Buy it, but if you are a fan of martial arts WATCH this movie!"
5,interesting tidbit,"Not sure if anyone has mentioned this, the fight choreographer, the indomitable Yuen Woo Ping has a little role in this movie. He's character is the old police head, who got demoted at the middle of the movie."
2,"warning, english language only!","i just bought this on dvd and the only audio tracks available are in english. it's a real rip-off to make a dvd of a chinese movie and NOT have any chinese language available! i don't know if there's a DVD available with english subtitles, but i'd recommend that much more. there's a lot of meaning lost in the translation, and the movie feels more like something you'd watch at 3am on cable tv. if they offered a chinese language track, this DVD would easily be 5 stars."
5,Jet Li is the Greatest Martial Artist Since Bruce Lee,"This 1994 Hong-Kong martial arts production starring Jet Li is simply unbelievable. The fight sequences are fast, brutal and perfectly choreographed by the famous Yeun-Wo Ping. It has an emotional story, adrenaline-pumping action and outstanding music. I am a fairly new fan of Jet Li and just starting to collect some of his amazing films. Let me tell you, being a huge fan of the ultimate master of martial-arts, Bruce Lee, I can say with all honesty that Jet Li rivals the grace, power, finesse, speed and agility that Lee displayed in his movies. Anyway, back to the movie, I found this re-make of Bruce Lee's classic ""Fist of Fury"" both satisfying and breathtaking. This is definetely one of the greatest martial-arts movies I have ever seen. This is a must-see for any action fan or any fan of the cinema for that matter. Thanks for reading my review."
5,Jet li at his best !!!!,Enough with kajiu films now its time for review on some martila arts films.Jet li remake of bruce lee Fist of Fury aka.Chinese Connection U.S. title is far epic and most high speed martial arts movies out there.Really the story is the same as Fist of Fury but Jet li fighting ability and acrobatic are awesome in this movie.This is a must have dvd or vhs.The fighting scenes will blow you away.Note:Suggest you get the original one with subtitle for the language and msuic score.
5,The Best of Jet Li,"I have seen lots of Jet Li's movies. This is one of Jet Li's the best interms of the action scenes. The story is some what copy of the Fist of Fury, but hey if you are a martial arts lover and looking for one of the Jet Li's best fighting scenes, you got a see this one. What makes the fights more enjoyble is the vividness of the kicks and the punches and the no use of the damn wires. And if you are a martial atrs movie collector then this is a must for you to buy."
4,Jet Li redeems himself,"Yes this is a tribute to Bruce Lee's movie, but soon people will overlook that and realize that Jet is the next Bruce Lee. The story in this movie was excellent, of course the fight scene are great, The picture quality in this movie is really not that great, but the voice overs are very believable."
5,"oh yeah, Jet Li is the man","I watched this movie with my friend one night and I loved this movie, its the best kung-fu movie I have seen since Black Belt Jones that did not get boring after a while, like bruce lee's Chinese Connection (its a gret kung-fu movie but it got boring after a while). This movie has a very good plot and is action packed with karate kicks and chops. Very good tribute to Bruce Lee, i think? BUY THIS MOVIE NOW."
3,"Movie's still great, but translation isn't","I've loved this movie since I was a kid and so I was stoked when I saw it was coming to BD. I just got it today and put it into the PS3. The movie's still as great as ever, both picture and audio. However the subtitles for the movie are horribly inaccurate. As a Cantonese speaker it feels as if the people the wrote the subtitles watched the movie on mute and were just guessing at what the actors were saying. So while I could get along fine with Chinese audio alone, I depend on the subtitles for the Japanese parts. Since the Chinese parts were so off I can only assume that the Japanese parts may well be too. I'm sure the subs would probably convey a cogent story, but just know that it may not be exactly the one the director intended it to. If it weren't for this I'd probably give it a 5 but since the subtitles are probably needed for the viewers who don't understand both Chinese and Japanese, 3 stars."
5,One of The Best,"This Movie is one of the best martial arts films that I have seen in a long time. Jet Li has proven to the world that he can live up to the name of the ""legend"". The action was unbelievable and without a doubt, one of the best martial arts film that I've ever purchased. I've only owned this movie for less than a month now and have already watched it like 5 times. My friends who are martial arts instructors were really impressed. I don't think there was a disappointing ""fight scene"" in the entire movie. Well worth having in my collection of movies."
2,picture quality,"this seems not fit to be among blu ray, seems like regular DVD. still a must for Jet Li fans"
4,The most INSANE martial arts movie ever!,"This is by far the best martial arts movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Better than any of those Jackie Chan movies. If you are looking for an awesome martial arts experience, buy this NOW!"
3,Fist of Legend,"Jet Li is pretty good, however, I prefer the original with Bruce Lee! So if you like action you should get the original its way better."
5,Jet Li Is Master,Been watched this movie in 1995 on VHS tape. Now its came out DVD. Great but not Best compare to Blu Ray.
5,EXCELLENT! A MUST SEE!!!!,"This is the best Jet Li film made, great fighting.. there are lots of scenes!! You you didn't see this movie yet.... GO AND BUY IT NOW!!!! TOTALLY AMAZING! Only thing bad with this movie is the cheesy music =P Anyways... go see it now!"
4,action packed and funny,"this movie is gold, it has great fighting scenes,the story is good and jet li is at his best, along with his acrabatic stunts he also puts a little bit of comedy into it. Get this, its cool"
5,best final fight ever,I've watched this movie a million times and still love it. I've seen too many weak bad guys that ruin movie climax. The general is not one of them. Great fights and great fighting music.
3,Jet Li unstoppable force of nature,"Being a big hong kong martial arts movies fan when I found out Fist of fury is getting a remake I first laughed at the idea, since who ever was gonna play Bruce Lee's charachter was just gonna look like a cheap imitation, so I avoided hiring out the film. When I bought my DVD player I came across the film again and decided to buy it watched it from beginning to end and was amazed, just when I thought martial arts films couldn't get any better. It was the first time I saw a Jet Li film. The fight seens are very good a 5 star for the film, but the DVD is a major let since its been ditributed by Disney who havent heard of extra features and think scene selection and interactive menus which arent interactive at all are special features. The film deserves a behind the scenes featurette and interviews etc."
1,Bad decisions are out there.,"Buying this is one of them.However that's nothing compared to the bad decision the jokers at dimension made when they put together this dvd. Yeah, they thought, let's take this great movie, with fantastic choreography, interesting storyline etc, and ruin it by dubbing it in English so the oh so Japanese girlfriend sounds like a dumb American high school bimbo. Good idea champs. Great idea. Now, put the icing on the cake you've baked and don't bother putting the cantonese audio anywhere close. Sure, dvds can handle more than one audio track, but hey, who needs em?Oh yeah, let's cut three minutes from it too. Just for fun."
4,Jet Li's best martial arts film,"""Fist of Legend"" is still Jet Li's best martial arts film to date. How fitting since it's a re-imaging of Bruce Lee's classic ""Fist of Fury"" (originally released as ""chinese Connection"" in US).The video, while not reference standard quality, is probably the best you will find of this film. I am happy that the original cantonese language track is included. The Japanese characters actually speak, for the most part, in actual Japanese on the cantonese track! There are also Mandarin and English audio options. But I highly recommend watching it in Cantonese (with English subtitles). The are a decent amount of extras including delete scenes.My only real gripes are that I wished that makers of this disc used the original opening credits and music track; And that the certain minor liberties were taken with the literal translation of the film.Regardless, If you're like me and ranks ""Fist of Legend"" as one of the greatest martial art films ever - this is a MUST BUY Blu-ray!"
4,Outstanding film but the DVD is incomplete,"Others have said it the best before me but.... This is a remake of the Bruce Lee classic Fists Of Fury (released as The Chinese Connection in the US, not to be confused with the US release of a Bruce film titled Fists Of Fury which was actually ?The Big Boss?.) While an outstanding film, my only problem is that the DVD is english ONLY. I wanted to hear the actors as they really are, not dubbed by some acting student (sorry. Voice Actor.) if dubbing doesn't bother you , or if you prefer it you'll love the movie anyway."
5,great movie,great movie lots of action i think this is some of jet li greater workif you like action movies this is one to watch
5,jet li,great movie. jet li's version of an old bruce lee film. bruce lee's film was titled as the chinese connection.
4,blu ray Good but flawed,Ok fist of legend blu ray has an awesome picture but the subtitles suck they just you used the subtitles from the english dub I can only understand alittle bit of chinese also another grip I have with the blu ray there's no hd options for the blu ray the 2 disc dvd from the weinstein company went all out it's alittle dissappointing they didn't with blu ray
5,The Greatest Martial Arts Film of All Time,"You have to watch this movie. I cannot say enough good about this movie: it is simply the best. The action sequences surpass anything that has ever been shown on the american big screen, by a long shot. If you havent seen this movie, you have no idea of what true martial arts action is."
4,Pretty good,If you want to see some really good realistic fights-get this movie. Story is pretty average but fabulous fights that Jet Li performs will keep you entertained.
4,paco de matilde,one of his very best compilations and new releases that we can't hear easily here in Perú
5,This style of clamp is terrific,"I had previously bought a shorter version of this clamp and was happy with the results so I thought I'd try the 36"" style for some slightly larger products. They work incredibly well and can be moved into and out of place with ease. The pads also prevent any damage being done to wood being held by the clamp itself. Any version of this clamp from Denali is highly recommended."
4,"solid clamps, but big and heavy","these are pretty solid, and heavy clamps, given I already have a pair of pipe clamps I probably should have ordered this with the quick release pistol grip clamps vs this type, seems kind of overkill"
5,What a deal!,"I recently bought some small quantities of Denali clamps to see what they looked like. I immediately bought more after seeing the quality of their clamps.These 3x36 clamps are excellent medium duty clamps, and for the price (I paid under $11 per clamp) they are a steal. I don't have many hours of use under my belt on these yet so I can't talk about longevity, but I would be shocked if I ever had a problem. The stop mechanism on the sliding head is the same type used on pipe clamps and it is a joy to work with. Buy some. In fact, buy a lot."
5,16-year-old loves her monkey,Cuddlewumps is just so much fun. She shares all her secrets with him. He's the best little monkey anyone could have.
3,Little Monkey,"We call our daughter ""little Monkey"" and I wanted her to have a cute monkey stuffed animal to sleep with. I bought this one based on the reviews. It is very cute, durable and nice and soft. It's just a little too big for her to sleep with. It was almost the same size as her at [...] old."
4,Not a career-spanning collection,"If you are looking for a career-spanning collection of Jennifer Warnes' best songs, this isn't it. Unfortunately you can't buy one. For the early years of ""Right Time of the Night,"" ""I Know a Heartache When I See One"" and ""I'm Restless,"" this isn't bad. Later material like ""Up Where We Belong"" and her outstanding Leonard Cohen covers are missing. But for a couple of dollars, this CD is worth the money."
4,more about EBF than weaning,"Although this book is supposed to be about weaning it is more geared to extended breast feeding. It is more based on child led weaning which correlates to the La Leche League principles. If you are looking for suggestions to wean cold turkey; this is not the book for you. This is more of an attachment parenting approach than anything. I would recommend this book but it takes a reader who has that mindset. There are many stories and quotes from mothers who have has the experience. It is wasy to read and informative. However, this is one of few books that even mention nursing past 12 months so it is more openminded in that perspective."
4,Great message,"This book had a wonderful message, and was very helpful in understanding why my daughter is reluctant to wean."
3,Book on Natural Weaning,"I was looking for a book to help me with gentle suggestions for weaning. This book suggested natural weaning, where you wait until the child weans himself."
2,How whaning happens,"If the purpose for purchasing this book is to wean you child in the least troumatic way, for whatever reason, do not bother. You will only learn how not to wean. But if you don't really have to wean, you might feel stronger about continueing nursing. After 25 months of nursing I have so many reasons to wean I can't even beging to list them. I don't think La Leche Legue will ever help anyone wean. It would be like a catholic preaching buddism. I read much more practical suggestions in ""What to expect the toddler years"""
1,Cheap P O S,Problem after problem after problem I am not one to send things back I usually just get rid of them and don't buy the brand again so no more Lite on for me EVER.
3,"Decent, yet has some flaws","I've owned it for about a year and it is to record shows on a whim. But to set a timer to record it sometimes doesn't record the show giving some kind of error.The clock diveates about a minute every few weeks or so, so i have to reset it every month, which is pain.The Recorder sleep function does not work. After recording a show using the manual record, the recorder does not shut off, so if you have a program scheduled to timer record after, it won't because the recorder is still on."
1,I'D GIVE IT A ZERO IF I COULD--IVE BEEN THROUGH 3 NEW UNITS AND NONE WORK!!,"[...]The Setup menu wouldn't work--it kept flickering on and off and I couldn't set the date, time, etc.--no use in trying to record a program if I can't do that. The retailer wouldn't take the unit back (without the UPC code) so I contacted Lite-On. They suggested the firmware upgrade, but my unit wouldn't read 4 different brands of cd-r's when I downloaded the firmware, so asked for them to send me a factory disc--which took a month and I live 15 miles from their factory.Uploaded the firmware, but still didn't work. So I returned it to Lite-On and got a new unit. Had the same problem, returned that one, got the new one--same problem. They dont' want to refund my purchase and now want me to go through a 4th unit. NO WAY!! Pay a few extra bucks and get a Pioneer 533 or Panasonic EH 50--that's what I plan on doing."
1,LEAST HELPFUL NCLEX RN BOOK AVAILABLE!,I have all the NCLEX RN books for study and this is the worst! I thumbed through this book at a discount book store (for $2) and wouldn't have considered purchasing it! Not comprehensive at all. There are much better books out there...don't waste your money!
1,What a Lie,"How can they put ""Passing Guaranteed"" when I know a lot of people who used this book and did not pass? Before buying this book search the web for help! If I had my choice, I would give this book NO STARS!!!"
1,DON'T Buy,"I bought this along with several other programs due to its having a CD (even though it had only one practice test)and its being advertised to mimic the new NCLEX format. The book and the CD were not in the new format and didnt have questions (such as multiple multiples and diagrams) similar to the new NCLEX. Also, after taking the 2 hour practice test, the program would not let me see my results nor the analysis of any questions. Tech phone support said it happens sometimes and to try retaking the test (waste another 2 hrs of my valuble time?) Tech email support sent a return email several days after I had already taken the NCLEX.So neither the book nor the CD is as Kaplan advertised and the CD doesnt work and tech support in awful. Therefore don't waste your money on this. Two very good study tools I recommend are from ERI and from Lippincot. I credit these two aids (along with alot of prayer) with passing NCLEX after answering only 75 questions.Joe Munzberg, RN"
1,Don't Waste Your Money !,I had the previous edition of this book & bought this one thinking I would be getting newer info . What a joke ! The information is almost identical except for a few minor changes that have nothing to do with content even the practice exam was the same . Not a very good endorsement for Kaplan's live program .
1,The Print is Abominable,"This particular edition in its numerous choices of colour in Bonded Leather, has abominably small print. The box has a blurb which states that it has 'the largest type of any pocket-size Bible'. Really?? I'd hate to see the smallest!!! I have passed on this edition for exactly that reason, and from the number of unsold copies in various bookstores, quite a few others have passed on this one, also. Find yourself an HCSB with good print and benefit from this translation of God's Word."
3,sub-par for this author,"Jagger's last novel is sub-par from her usual high standard, yet still worth reading if a fan of her other, wonderful novels. It's her usual tale of clashing Victorian families and women looking for fulfillment, love and a measure of independence in a stifling society. This novel feels unfinished and many characters vanish from the stage for long periods, yet Jagger was such an accomplished storyteller, if you liked her other titles, give this one a try. It was her last novel and perhaps was published posthumously before she'd had a chance to work out plot and character problems."
5,THE DOCUMENTARY THAT OUGHT TO BE,"Calling all documentary film makers. ""American Vulgar,"" a new book by the veteran author-commentator Robert Grudin, offers you a rare opportunity to create a film that's compelling, intelligent and important. It not only presents a perceptive, visually rich diagnosis of a central issue of our time; it also lays out practical prescriptions. Whoever sees (or reads) ""American Vulgar"" will enjoy its style and be heartened by its content. It's an ""upper."" If you can't wait for a film that might never be (alas!), you can order ""American Vulgar"" from amazon.com.PS. If there's a Heavenly Review of Books, a delighted Daniel Patrick (""defining deviancy down"") Moynihan will write a glowing review of ""American Vulgar"" that'll end with an ""I told you so."""
4,Dandelions in a Jelly Jar,I loved this book it reminds me of how it was growing up in a small town. People don't like it when new people come in and start changing things. This story reminds me alot of my own mother dealing with my grandmother and all her freind when she got married. I gave the books a Can of Peas as a gift and now i'm giving this one as a gift too. Read it and you will laugh at what happens to the two big city sister that move to the small town to be with there men.
4,Story-telling splashes against the shores of Lake Emily,"Traci DePree has a storyteller's gift of weaving patterns of relationships, personalities, and connections that pull her readers into her tales. A Can of Peas was a delight, and so is Dandelions in a Jelly Jar.This time around, it's Trudy Ploog who comes to town and shakes things up like snow in a Santa paperweight. When the school board messes with her art program, Trudy doesn't act like a sweet, small-town girl: she brings some of her big city fighting skills with her and creates a little tempest in a teapot. This creates some stress between Trudy and her hometown boyfriend, Bert and the rest of the Morgan family.There's nothing terribly deep here; just a sweet tale of rural life, faith, hope, and courage."
5,Wonderful!!!!!!!!,I have been awaiting the arrival of this book with great anticipation. I was not disappointed. I think that A Can Of Peas is on my all time favoarite list and now this one is right beside it!! I highly recommend reading both of these books.
3,Predictable,"I will be honest. I just skim-read this book in about an hour and a half, because there was just not much plot to follow. I read the first book, and it was just okay. I was hoping this book would expand on the characters, but the characters are just shallow and immature. I really wanted to like this series. With that being said, it was not a bad little story, and actually kind of cute in spots, just don't expect much from it."
3,Middle,"This is the second of a three ( so far) series. It is an easy read, and pulls the first book in and set up for the third. The series, if you are looking for a clean/good read is recommended."
2,This Author Has a Problem With Older Women in Familial Relationships,"Just as in her first book, Traci DePree's main character, Trudy, has a problem with an older woman. The older woman is Trudy's potential future mother-in-law, Lillian. Lillian does not exist to serve Trudy and fails to fall in thrall to her; therefore, according to the way DePree presents the material, the younger woman is entitled to treat the older woman with scorn and dislike. The story's premise is nice, the editing is well done, and the historical vignettes before each section that expand upon a character highlighted in the following section is a good writing device.DePree writes her young characters as full alpha females, not as maturing, family-oriented Christians."
1,YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN',ANOTHER CLEVER ATTEMPT AT PROFITING THROUGH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.WHAT ELSE IS NEW ?? WHEN WILL IT STOP????????
1,These dishes shatter so badly Im shocked,"I bought Corelle thinking it was safe dishware to have in my home.Its lovely, lightweight and cleans easily.I would not recommend this product even if it was free anymore.If it breaks, which I have had more break than drops to the floor that didnt, the product shatters so badly I am shocked.The old selling point of its shatter resistance is not the same as it once had been now. I do not recommend these dishes to anyone, they are just too dangerous, Im going back to regular dishes, any dishes out there Ive had in my lifetime did not explode like these do when dropped."
5,Compelling,"I couldn't put it down. The words swayed me into times and places of past, present, and future. Images cursed through mind of mad men and sultry lusts, dripping with sweetness and innocence. Some poems made me want to put my hand over my eyes like a child watching a scary movie, but still always peeking through the fanning of the fingers. I have tried to put the book down, and like an obsession, I keep reading, one more poem, one more poem. Wonderfully written, experience laden, and an emotional rollercoaster. Thank you for sharing, the world needs more."
4,Shannon rules the beats again!,"If you like dance music with a euro-tecno edge, you'll like this single. I bought it because the vocalist is Shannon (of ""Let the Music Play"" fame) and I love her vocals. She plays the diva part beautifully, never overshadowed by the beats. The best mix by far is the John B. Norman mix which strips the song down to the strong beats and the lovely Shannon. Shannon rules!"
2,bad,"bad actting bad choice of actors to use, they used gay porn actors who dont have ANY actting abillity and are out of shape, I would of used no name actors who would look good on camera buy my copy: YIM user666468952002 PLEASE p.s. sorry I bought the 2nd year at the same time ( my bad) LOL ;)"
3,Fang Bang,"Were Should one start.1. The acting was not great at all. The story line was not great either.2. Production value was low. All of Here! TV first seasons are like this.3. I have to say the promotion of safer sex was great to see. I give them credit there. I mean with it being a sex club, promoting safe sex says a lot.4. Eventhough it was not a great story line. I will admit, that I am looking forward to the second season in Spring 08."
2,Ridiculous,"Outside of the hotties that are in the background, this show is ridiculous. These characters are weak.The instant play service is nice but don't waste your money on this failed attempt."
3,It gets better,"I am being generous with the three stars because the series does get better. The first season is bad, as bad is it can get production wise. But there are redeeming qualities and you need to put up with this poor start to enjoy the rest of the series, which does get better but never more the four stars. Something to watch on a stormy night when going out is out of the question and you have already done it twice."
2,Arbitrary twists and almost no full frontal nudity,"There are some very good parts of the story. Some of the plot is good. However, much of the story as it relates to the vampires and the vampires activity seems to be a lame effort. It as if no real planning was made and they simply made up the store quickly as they went along."
1,Really Bad,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. Really, really bad acting. I can't believe that this show lasted even an entire season. Don't waste your money."
1,This Bites AND Sucks,"This review is for those genuinely curious about ""The Lair."" Don't be fooled by reviews stating that this is trashy fun. It's not. It's lame. One of the two performers who doesn't completely embarrass himself is ex-porn star Colton Ford, but since the director decided to ""Just for Men"" all over his head, he looks rather odd. I've made it through the first 3 episodes of 6 and I'm not going any further. (If only ""Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still around to take a crack at this....) Sometimes shows are so bad they're good; this is simply bad."
3,A Bit Corny but Fun,"The series is fun but if your looking for serious acting then I would suggest this is not for you. There is lots of skin but the ""orgy"" gets a bit tired in every scene as they never do anything much. I will not purchase season 2."
1,If only no stars was an option....,"Basically the show is so outlandish, I found myself wanting a vampire to suck me dry so that I wouldnt have to watch this anymore.The guys are all ugly. the acting sucks, dumb storyline... and I think they used a home video camera to record it.Need I say more."
4,Excellent,"This show, as it was so well advertised, is the perfect addition to any gay man's horror collection. Never before has there been such a well done show. Granted there were times where I was slightly bored, but overall it was an entrancing show. Quite bewitching if you catch my drift :). Personally, I can't wait for a second season!"
3,Gay Vamps,"This Here-TV Original Series is...inturrestin. N a Nut-Sheel, Gay Vampires iz what Ur gettin w/ the purrchase of thiz DVD. it's only 2 Discs, vurry few episodes. as U go through it, the Mystery un-ravels!*~R~*"
1,The Lair or a DVD to avoid,It is appropriate that this DVD is about Vampires because it both bites and sucks.Don't waste your money
4,EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT,"Um, whats to say? Average acting, average scripts, kinda silly. But hot guys, vampires, and sex -- this is the best show ever!Oh, and the DVD's play fine too."
1,Lair lacks flair: A step above watching corn grow,"I laughed when I watched Lair - and not because there were any intentionally funny segments. There was only one person with any acting skills was Brian Nolan, but his Frankie charactor was unbelievable starting with the first scene he was in. The laughable moments continued with another character getting bitten on the right side of his neck in one scene - and then he is shown in the hospital with a bandage on the left side of his neck. Nobody was paying attention to the writing, the acting or editing it seems.Maybe it is because I'm spoiled with great television entertainment like BTVS Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel and Tru Calling. Did Lair make it beyond season one? I saw mention of Season Two being scheduled to air. I'm very surprised. If it makes it further than Tru Calling did, I'll be very upset. A waste of time and money in my opinion. I'd be embarrassed to try to sell my Lair season one."
3,Simple summary,"This is a affine idea that for me is cheesy portrayal. If you are in for a 10 year old mind experience, it is fine. Acting is moder ate at best.David Kazm"
4,Good for the Veggie Lover,"My 2 year old son really enjoyed playing this game, but he was a little young for it still. He LOVES Veggie Tales and so that really helped him still enjoy the game. I definitely think if we pull it back out in a year or two it will be perfect.But other than the age problem, I think it was a good game. Cute and creative like all of the Veggie Tales products."
2,Very frustrating & disappointed,"I was dissappointed that the game did not function on our computer. The computer meets the system requirements, yet things like the bumper cars and roller coaster don't work. My daughter loves veggie tales, but becomes very frustrated with this game. I also agree that it would have been nice to have some of the spiritual values taught in this game as well."
5,Great tool and actually a useful design,"I've received quite a few weird looks when I pull out this hammer. However I've actually used the design to my advantage quite a few times. It's amazing what that little bit of curve can help accomplish. If you are trying to hammer around something, an inch or two can make a big difference. For the quality, I think it's great and should last a long long time. I have a few of these and have had them for a few years now without any issues."
3,Not as bad as you think,Another great album by George Strait the King of country music. If you love George Strait you'll love this one.
2,I was dissapointed,"I'm a big Strait fan, I own all his other CD's and I like both his old stuff and his new stuff, but I thought this album was lacking something. It seemed like in a lot of the songs he was trying to go back to the way he used to sound, but something was missing. In more than one song the rhythm and rhyming sounded akward or stretched, and most of the songs were not something you could easily sing along with. And maybe he was doing it on purpose or maybe it's becasue he is getting older but his voice didn't sound as strong as it usually does."
2,Good album...but not great,"I agree with Tyler. This album is good...but when comparing George to the standards George has made for himself...this album falls short. Sure there are a couple of really good songs on here, but this CD is not in the same league with Right or Wrong, Strait from the Heart, Strait Country, and a couple others. Some people love George just for George...which is great, but if you judge the style of songs and albums you see this CD is not as good as a lot of them.Scott J."
5,In line with the quality we expect from George,"This album is great. I loved it because it has more slow, pretty songs where you can hear more of George. The song Calm Waters made me cry! If you even remotely like George Strait, you will love this album. Every song has the potential to go to #1 and all are superbly written. I understand that every song on an album can't be a great one, but this album really has got some great songs. I don't think that he has put out this good of an album since the Pure Country Soundtrack. This album is a must have for every George Strait fan."
2,Strait talk,"I'm right there with Tyler and Scott J. and the other reviewers who did not give this album ""the highest of marks"". Usually, I like all the songs on George's album, even the ones that are not my particular favorites. But on this album too many of the songs make me want to fast forward to the next song. I feel cheated, not in in terms of money, but in terms of listening pleasure. I'm used to practically wearing out George's albumns, and I will never be able to get into this albumn like I have others such as #7 and Strait from the Heart. There are soooo many great song writers out there, I don't know how George failed to choose a better selection of songs, songs more authentically country and with more meaningful lyrics. I would have to recommend skipping this albumn and waiting for the few good songs on it to turn up on George's next greatest hits recording.Northeast Fan"
2,GEORGE NEEDED (HOME) IMPROVEMENT,"This CD is without QUESTION his worst CD, and the only song that makes a top FIFTY GS list is ""Home Improvement"" (Which is actually a top 10 song). I give it two stars for that song and ""Don't Let Me Come Over There And Love You"". And that is the best I can say about this GS major misfire."
1,'Strait' off the road and in the ditch..his only bad album,"My god, George Strait...he;s never even mildly dissapointed me, well, except my fav album of his 'One Step At A Time', has such a mundane song on it the silly 'That's The Breaks'...(haha...and it's on my favourite Strait album...how ironic)With titles like 'Looking Through My Window Through The Pain' ??!! Owch...what a cheeeesy title. George, what were you thinking? And all of these songs here, minus the fairly happy ""Don't Make Me Come Over There And Love You', that's not bad. THis album was probably rushed, or done out of the fact he might be on contract to do an album every nine months...and this was just a mud pie of the group. Boring, musically flat, and silly titles. Thank God for albums like 'Blue Clear Sky', or 'Ocean Front Property'."
2,same old song and dance,"it seems that his great voice and ive been told by many women his looks to its what gets him his attention.. ,but this album is the same music of his previous three..Does he just sang over his old albums music..Hes a great singer and if you're a die hard fan then grab it.Its nothing new though so think hard."
3,Not Georges Best,"Ofcourse I love George, I own most of his cds but this one was, like some other reviews have said, lacking something. As much as I love him there usually is one or two songs that I dont particularly care on all of his albums, but there are more than two here. He dosent write songs and that's the thing I've always kind of not liked about him, he's wrote a couple but that's it. He listens to hundreds upon hundreds of song and I know he heard songs that would have been better for this album, his song choice is questionable. But he's George, so you know there will be some songs that will be great, Like,""Go On"", ""Dont Make Me Come Over There And Love You"", ""If It's Gonna Rain"". But all in all this is not George Strait's best album, I dont think that's a secret, maybe not even to George himself."
4,Well worth a read,"There's nothing new or very revealing, but it's worth the read to see it ""in her own words."". So much has been written about her, it's interesting to read her statements."
1,very disappointing,"It says very clearly in the ad that this book includes a one-hour DVD with it, but my order arrived without the DVD. After sending 3 emailsto the vendor's customer servce, none of them are replied. But the vendoris still selling the same items at Amazon. I think that with their poor service quality, this vendor should be removed from the Amazon immediately."
1,Don't buy this on Kindle!,"I bought this for my mom on Kindle thinking the pictures and stuff would be great on her Ipad but lo and behold, when we downloaded the book the publisher had removed all images from the kindle edition and even removed the cover. A total waste of money. Kindle buyers beware. They should at least warn customers that they are not getting the original content if they are going to buy a digital version."
5,Loved it!!,"loved this book, loved her though her story is yet fully told I don't beleve. There is still much not in the public eye that was the Kennedy way, the lifg, the history and now, well its about all over isn't it, who carries the flame???"
5,persuasive and profitable telephone communications,"This book has some sensible advice and workable techniques for persausive and profitable telephone communications that you can use right away, regardless of your industry, particulary if you rely on cold-calling to get that appointment. The sections that I've found helpful include developing a selling telephone image, how to avoid language that sounds ""salesly"" or threatening, leaving voicemail messages that have impact, how to deal with screeners to get to the correct decision-makers. Even better are the templates that you fill in, depending upon your product or service, to stimulate interest at the beginning of your call, using a recommended menu of words and phrases (this was invalable for me). Other sections I have dog-eared include setting appointments over the phone, handling follow-up calls, dealing with different objections, and some great closing ideas. A great investment."
3,Wish i'd written this book because,"My apologies, i must have been reading a different book. I wish i had written this book because i'm no expert and i feel i could probably have written it. Please don't take that the wrong way, i think you only need to get one great idea for you to get value out of a book and i'm sure there are lots of those in here."
4,Don't Attempt to Sell Without Reading This First,"""I read Volume 1 and 2 of ""How to Sell More ..."" several months ago and I apply the principles every day. Simply put, they are excellent. I have jumped head first into sales and my success has much to do with these tips. I have listened to many tapes and read many books and none of them was as helpful as this information. Using these techniques I am able to be a business consultant and not just a salesman peddling my wares. I have highly recommended these books to friends and family and will continue to do so to anyone involved in business development."""
5,A must have sales book,I am going to give this 5 stars. I thought volume #1 was really good. This book is great. Everything you need to know from a Telesales standpoint. Get this book now. Highly Recommend.
4,Whitney Houston Deluxe,I like Whitney Houston. With this cd they repeat several tracks with instrumentation. Didn't care for that myself. But it come with a DVD. So it' good.
2,Lousy recording for audiophiles,The songs are wonderful but the recording is terrible. The basic overzealous recording engineer thinking he knows what you want to hear. This is okay for the boombox out in the yard but is awful on the home stereo.
3,"Great Voice, Okay Songs","It seems although Whitney is a fabulous singer she has never made great albums. She is more of a singles artist then an album artist. Her albums have always had some fillers in them and often most material are ballads or cheesy dance track. This album is by no means different. However vocally it is her best album. Whitney's vocals on this album sound fresh, her voice was also different. Whitney also does something else on these songs than the next. She does not oversing and though she sings loud sometimes it doesnt annoy you unlike what happened later were she began oversing so much that it made me wanna break the radio. As for the material on this album. The album is dated and there are only few stand out tracks on this. The singels are probably the best songs on this album. Whitney is a talented woman ( or was, she needs profesional help now) and it is sometimes sad to see that she never made a great album like Aretha who always made brilliant albums. 6/10."
5,Soulful and Sensuous,This CD on many ways is a great triumph. It is a great CD for relaxing. I listen to it loud. I am proud to own it. I like the songs that didn't really stand out.They are Thinking About You and Someone For Me. I think that her working with Kashif was a great idea. He has a great sound and great way of making things very soulful. Also letting Jeffrey Osborne (My favorite Singer) to write All At Once. Listen... I know You'll love it!
4,One of True Stars Born in 1980s (3.5 stars),"The 21-year-old singer appeared seemingly out of nowhere in the spring of 1985 and soon went to become one of America's most-loved stars. In a rare feat, three consecutive singles went all the way to the top of US pop charts and helped make ""Whitney Houston"" one of best-selling debut recordings in pop-music history.The three singles, ballads ""Saving All My Love For You"", ""Greatest Love Of All"" and energetic disco tune ""How Will I Know"" showcased Whitney's fiery, gospel-trained voice (and videos her great looks, too). However, the album as a whole is not in a vintage category, with too large part of it being stuck in the mid-1980's uninspired black pop. Still, worth mentioning is the ballad ""All At Once"" and tender duet with Teddy Pendergrass ""Hold Me""; interestingly, second part of the album is considerably better than the first, as if the producers were giving listeners a treat for patience."
5,WHITNEY FINALLY GIVES SOMETHING BACK TO THE FANS...,"anyone who's been a fan of whitney's over the past 25 years will appreciate this newly remastered and reissued debut album. this album brings back so many memories for me. the remastering is flawless. they restored the original version of Greatest Love of All. i was thrilled to have the jellybean remix of How Will I Know. the best part is the dvd, with the videos, rare live footage, and recent whitney/clive interview. thanks, whitney/clive! i hope they do the same for her 2nd and 3rd album (celebrating it's 20th anniversary this year)."
3,Powerhouse voice.,"Whitney Houston's debut album was great because of Whitney's killer chops but the songs on here are pretty average. Clive Davis thinks he is the best thing that ever existed but he likes to control his artists every move, from picking the songs and what their image should be. Whitney should've been given better material than these run-of-the-mill pop tunes. How Will I Know is still my favorite Whitney song but overall, Whitney was told what to do and that's never a good thing."
4,Slightly difficult to read but worth the time,"As Packer says in the Foreword, ""The present treatise is vintage Owen, searching and spiritual, devotional and doxological, the product of a masterful mind and a humble heart.""It does not read like a novel, but it is worth the time to read Owen's material on Biblical theology.Note: Biblical Theology is that which starts with Genesis and builds teachings based *only* on what the particular writers have to say about a topic, building the theme together as one progresses through Scripture. ""Systematic Theology"" is that which takes a topic (i.e., the atonement) and finds all applicable texts from all over Scripture to form a concise teaching of that doctrine.Owen's book is a Biblical theology. He begins with the Garden and progresses through the whole of Scripture developing themes and teachings as he takes the reader through.Difficult but very insightful!"
2,Looks can be deceiving!,"The watch is beautiful beyond belief but after 8 months the strap just broke, the watch fogged up for no reason! The quality is horrid! It's pretty but that's as far as it goes!"
5,Huge Fun,"An amazing tale of the fantastic cover and deception schemes devised by the Allies (primarily Brits) to deceive the Germans about the Normandy invasion plans. Wonderfully clever and often downright amusing in conception and delivery, many of these fanciful schemes had phonominal success in disorienting the Germans, providing a total surprise for the Allies on D Day, saving perhaps tens of thousands of Allied soldiers' lives, and very likely determing the outcome of the war itself. Anthony Cave Brown tells the story with conviction, gusto and humor. Why didn't his book get on my list 25 years ago?"
5,Intelligence made the difference,"This is an exhaustive account of the role of intelligence leading to the eventual success of the Normandy invasion which opened the last chapter of the Third Reich. It is a dramatic story, with a wealth of plots and counter plots featuring the most guarded secret of the war: Ultra, the machine which solved the Nazi's codes .It is also an excellent account of the most massive invasion in history, complete with all of the attendant peculiarities of the key participants. Although exhaustive in content, its interest never flags, for it deals with the ""make or break"" nature of D Day. Highly recommended."
5,Bodyguard of Lies,"Thorough research and a gripping rendition of history combine for a very readable book that clearly explains the intricate web of the most complex intelligence and counter-intelligence operation in World War II. Anthony Cave Brown does a tremendous job with this book. Don't let the length of this book get to you -- you won't know where the pages went once you start reading! I am a history buff, but learned a great deal in this reading. Highly recommend!"
3,Inaccuracies spoil it,"A well written book which gives much information about deception and spying. Unfortunately when easily disproved ""facts"" are stated by the author, one wonders just how many other inaccuracies there are within its pages.This detracts from one's enjoyment of the book."
5,An awesome explanation of behind the scenes work to prepare for D-Day!,"I read this book when it first came out and it made an impressive impact on my WWII studies. Before History Channel, before The Military Channel, this is the book that lifted the veil on the work needed to make D-Day a success. The TV shows do an adequate job but they do not go to the level within the book. The work of the Bodyguards helped immensely in saving lives of the braves troops that hit the beach and continued on to liberate Europe. A must read!"
1,Dover Edition Much Better,"The two volume Dover edition is much much better. This is watered down, and doesn't contain the important details that make it so interesting. It has very few of the illustrations found in the two volume set. This was a big let down. I bought this thinking it was similar to the Dover addition which a friend of mine owned."
1,Incidents of Travel in Yucatan (Volume Two),Very bad books and John L. Stephens writing about himself not about MayaNothing in his book has any value at allI have wasted my money andthe time it took to read it
3,The band's least exciting album (for me anyway),"This is, without a doubt, the worst Grateful Dead album ever. How bad was it? It was so bad that the band didn't even bother to record another one for seven years. Even the band agreed that this was a turkey after it's release. It's not that the songs are all THAT bad, it's just that on here they go nowhere and take their time getting there. The funny thing here is that the bonus tracks, for the most part, are just as uninspired. British producer Gary Lyons should've stuck to producing Foreinger and left the Dead alone. Although, the band shares just as much responsibility for this."
3,diggin da disco suitz!,"Maybe this one takes sum gettin used to. u think Grateful Dead Plus Krazy-azz Foreigner producer Gary Lyons (What wuz Clive Davis thinking? Hey i got nuthin against Foreigner, But still...Just kinda ""hmm"" about it.) Good stuff is Alabama Getaway, Don't Ease Me In, the studio version of Althea, a song that would later appear in a live version on Without A Net. There's a couple of Brent Mydland penned tunes on here. Nothin really bad, really, but also nuthin 2 write home bout. Far From Me,cheesy-ish, sorta a good way,early eighties FM friendly AOR, sounds a little bit like, I Can't Tell You Why-ish (An Eagles song that Timothy B Schmitt sang that same year). Maybe it takes some getting used to but off the top of my head I can name at least a few much better GD studio albums: Workingman's Dead, American Beauty, Mars Hotel, In The Dark, Aoxomoxoa."
4,go to heaven. ok.,"Well I really hope he has gone to heaven. I actually have this version. The Japanese import. I forgot how I obtained it, nevertheless it is in my collection. Sounds great. Or ""grate"". My favorite from this release has always been ""Althea"". Very good for a Dead studio album. Everyone knows their live performances are better. When they were ""on"" at least. Good album. Check it out if you please. You even get to hear Brent Mydland whip out some vocals! Woo hoo!"
3,All good deadheads go to Heaven,Go to Heaven is a fair cd. Alabama get away is real good Althea is is good a real good vocal from Garcia. Feel like astranger Weirs best on this one sums up how i felt when i saw their show. Antwerp placebo is a good insttramental Dont ease me in is good good harmony enjoyable. Far from you is allright. Alabama get away Althea Antwerp placebo and Dont ease me in are the only songs close to the dead at ther best.
3,Average in every sense of the word.,"Sounding very bad on this album, makes it one of the Dead's worst studio albums. Far from Me, Lost Sailor and other songs all stink. But, as to be expected with the Dead, there are some good songs here. Althea, Don't Ease Me and Saint of Circumstance all are alright. The first album featuring Brent, Go to Heaven is surely misnamed."
1,Please make it stop,"The songs on this album bare no resemblance to the versions played in concert. And the songs are all below average besides. The fans of 80's and 90's Dead may like this album but it lacks passion. This is the reason the dead took over 5 years to make another album. The version of Feel Like a Stranger has no jamin like it did later on. Songs like Alabama Getaway, Lost Sailor, and Easy to Love You, just are plain boring. The only bright spot here is Althea though played much better live. If you wanted to introduce someone to the Dead do not show up with this CD, It is a loser all the way"
2,Shikoku,"CD was in good shape but the cover...Well? It was stained and looked old. Not to my standards of ""very good"". More like used for me. Is that fussy? A bit. I think I have gotten too many shotty discs through Amazon."
1,The most over-rated band of the century!,"The fact that this band reached the stardom it did can only be explained by the extensive drugs the fans had to take to find it at all interesting. Their music is rather bland, banal and monotonous!"
3,"""Go to heaven"" uneven","Well, there's been much criticism for the title and indeed the sleeve photograph, but actually this Dead record can be judged more favourably on the contents. Side two is a little dark, with the exception of ""Saint of Circumstance"", but side one contains some jewels. ""Feel like a stranger"" is very strong, ""Alabama Getaway"" surprising and ""Lost sailor"" and ""Far from me"" quite nice. But prince among ordinary citizens is ""Althea"", which has become one of my favourite Dead songs.""Go to Heaven"" may not be an excellent studio album, but we all know that the Dead were at their best when playing live. You won't go to heaven with this one, but you won't go unrewarded.Hans Wigman."
4,What Can You Say About Anyone in a White Suit?,"It's not American Beauty or Workingman's Dead, but this isn't that bad an album. Nowhere as bad as Dylan and the Dead. This gave us Don't Ease Me In, Sailor and Saint, and one of my all-time first set faves, Althea. The album is worth the $ for Althea alone, though some versions on some Dicks Picks kick butt and make this sound a little flat. Still, be kind. Any Deadhead should own this, if only to complete their 500-CD Dead collection..."
1,Not That Bad...But Not That Good,"i just wasn't into it....there was a lot of sex...multiple sex scenes and such....but again, no tension, no eroticism....when i read erotic books (or books claiming eroticism) i'd like to be brought into the story...i'd like to vibe with the characters...there wasn't even the joy of literary voyeurism....it was just cold sex...so if you are into a lot of sex without any feeling, buy this...otherwise, keep looking..."
2,Not for the average reader,"As a student of history, not focused on the period, I found this book a hard and annoying read. Riley-Smith focuses too much on proving his arguments through repetative evidence, and only through a close examination and arduous reading of the title from front to end does one gain a good understanding of what Riley-Smith wanted to convey. The art of story-telling does not live in this one..."
2,"Buy this book,then buy some coffee","I needed to read this book for a class, and of all the books I have read on the crusade this is by far the most boring."
2,Could have been more organized.,"The book is nice and clean and the pictures are clear and do focus on areas that you need to keep in mind. The problem with this guide is the information is so jumbled that it is hard to find information that you need especially when navigating to new areas on the city map. The game provides nice 3D replicas of the levels and the city areas, but often times I think it would be more functional to go with a more simplistic diagram. You can certainly navigate the game with book, but sometimes you gotta take some time to look up information mid game because the information is too scattered. It would have also been nice to provide the purchaser with a level ""loot list"" like many that you can find online to help players on expert level get their 100 percent loot requirement. All in all a guide is kinda unnecessary for this game, but the one they provide isn't ""bad,"" but I think it should have been more organized."
3,Somewhat Confusing,"This guide is not very well organized. It helps with the main missions well enough, but I constantly found myself searching through the guide to see where I currently was. The game allows quite a bit of freedom in how to move around the world (city), and this guide obviously had difficulties organizing its content around that.However, I did find the overall guide helpful. Especially the overview and introduction chapters got me in the right mindset to approach most of the game on my own."
2,I liked it more than my kids,"So when my children saw that Ape head that gadget stores were selling they LOVED it, I thought this would be a less severe(no pun intended) option.It scared them both and we gave it away.I thought it was really cool,and would have liked it when I was a kid *shrug*"
2,I'm not impressed,"My 6 year old son wanted this SO badly from Santa. Well, he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of Dec. What was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring, furry annoyance rather quickly. It is cute but there are several things that I (and my son) found wrong with the product. When he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes don't close all the way...kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real! Then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a HORRIBLE grinding noise! My son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken. I explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub. What else are you going to tell a child on Christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer?!Cute toy in theory, not so much in person though. I would not recommend this toy."
4,4 stars for age appropriate only -,The chimp can be a bit scary for young children. A 3 year old is afraid of it - it's too lifelike. A 7 year old thinks it's great. It would be nice if the chimp was softer so less of the mechanics could be felt.For an adult interacting with a child the chimp works real well also. Good teaching tool.
4,Great Toy!,"We bought this for my daughter's birthday, and she just loved it. Coming off the Curious George movie, she named it George and sleeps with it at night. The only issue we've had is that the arms are not as strong as they might be. She carried it by the arm once and now it is bent the wrong way and doesn't move correctly. Other than that, though, I can say that this interactive toy was a great hit in my household and has brought plenty of fun into her day."
4,Cute but boring...,"This little chimp is pretty animated if you can remember where the activation areas are (head, bottle in mouth, and I think hands...)Sadly, it kind of freaked-out my 6 year-old nephew (who did want it, by the way...) as it does look pretty real.All in all, cute but even that wears out after awhile."
3,"Age recommendation too low, toy too fragile","I think this product is interesting and the realism is fascinating, especially for my two boys, ages 5 and 1. But the first time my oldest son picked it up by the arm, the elbow joint broke causing many tears. I just don't think this works for younger children. My son is very careful--I can only imagine what a rough houser would do. I urge you to reconsider if buying for a young child."
4,Great for Lego birthday party,I ordered these for the treat bags for my son's Lego-themed birthday party. The kids built with them and then ate them. They are very cute and tastee good too.
4,Great party item,My son enjoyed having these for his LEGO themed birthday party. And you can build with them. They were great.
5,Great value!,"This was a great value for the product! I plan to use these in party favors at birthday parties. Thank you,"
2,"Photo Misleading - No grape, orange, or pineapple.","As much as I like this candy I have to challenge the photo above (unless they've changed it since this review). The product photo clearly shows 7 distinct colors/flavors (blue, green, yellow, red, white, purple, orange) and doesn't match what I received. The 3lbs I received included only 4 distinct colors/flavors (blue, green, yellow, red). Three flavors were missing entirely -- namely: white (pineapple), purple (grape), and orange (orange)."
4,SO YUMMY,"they taste GREAT and they are very colorful, and theres ALOT of themalso you CAN connect them BUT they dont say together very well.i still love the taste.blue-blue rasberryred-cherryyellow-bananaand i think green is green apple or lime"
1,No ingredients listed,"This was packaged in a shoddy plastic bag with no ingredient list. It looked like it was hand made in someone's basement. Because my son has food allergies, I had to throw this product away because I couldn't be certain it was safe. Other versions of this candy showed an ingredient list on the bag, and because it is THE LAW to list ingredients, I assumed they would be. And worse, it was not cost beneficial for me to mail back so it was cheaper for me to trash them. Sad all around. Cute idea though!"
1,"""rock"" candy","ew, i really hated this candy, but my sister always bought it. this crap always made me feel like i was trying to chew rocks. i swear if it was an harder it could've porbably broke my teeth."
4,Second Review,"After giving this album a second run, I change my opinion. This is a pretty good album, and the newer mix brings it all together. And while I still believe that ""So Alone"" and the Dolls first album are superior, I've come to appreciate this album on its own terms. Better than most other punk. High level of musicianship on Johnny's part (no pun intended.)"
4,Stone Junkie Rock,"This thing has been mixed, remixed, reissued so many times over the years I can't keep track of which version is which anymore. The songs are great and almost all of them are about getting high! Make sure you also have the live D.T.K. for all the great between song banter.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
4,Johnny Thunders&The Heartbreakers - 'L.A.M.F.:The Lost '77 Mixes' (Freud-Jungle),"This is maybe the third Johnny Thunders CD I've ever heard.Certainly can see WHY there have been so numerous titles of his put out.The late New York Dolls guitarist can certainly give the fans what they want.Total of fourteen good old school All American tracks here to wet appetite with.Most impressive cuts are ""Baby Talk"",""It's Not Enough"",the very NY Dolls-ish ""Pirate Love"",the rocking ""Let Go"" and the Berry Gordy cover ""Do You Love Me"".Line-up:Johnny Thunders-guitar&vocals,Billy Rath-bass,Walter Lure-guitar&vocals and fellow Dolls alumni Jerry Nolan-drums.Do check it out."
3,Not worth the money.,"Bought This for my wie to use,but she refused,found out the jack did not extend high enough to lift the wheels off the ground.This will work if your vehicle is low to the ground."
1,Great for lowered cars!,"Oops, it broke the fourth time I used it and it was slightly off center to the weight of my car. The teeth at the bottom bent and no longer meshed. The pins at the bottom bent as well.My whole car almost collapsed on top of it. Not worth destroying your car over."
3,"Easy to Break, But Functional","This is my second one of these. The first one worked great until the car rolled forward about 3 inches and snapped off two of the legs. I used it at least a dozen times. It works fine, as long as you start the engine before using the Jack, otherwise it grunts and groans to lift the car."
3,Electric Automotive Tire Jack,"This Jack works well for lifting the car body either for changing tires or for something else. The only thing wrong was the plug of the electrical cord is too big to fit my 2010 FORD Escape SUV cigarette lighter socket. This jack was made in China, I think they lack of ""standard"" control. I have to go to the auto parts store to find a Chinese made plug extension to make this jack to work. I mentioned this problem to Amazon Customer Service. They replied promptly and also refunded my plug extension purchasing. Amazon Customer Service really did superb job. Therefore I would continue to shop at Amazon.com."
4,Cheap but works,"This is a decent item that works fast. It takes less than 20 seconds to raise a wheel off the ground on my BMW 3-series.However I wish that the lifting point on this device was flat rather than pronged; it's already a little bent up and the rubber pads are ripped. I'm now using a wooden block in-between the lift point and the car.I also don't see what's the point of the on/off switch, it only controls the bulb. I'd prefer that be a safety switch, because as long as the device is plugged in, you could accidentally raise or lower the car by bumping the buttons.Also, the internal gears are plastic as someone said (you can see them when you remove a cap), but it doesn't appear that the device is stressed under load."
1,12 volt CAR JACK,BROUGHT THIS NICE 12 VOLT CAR JACK ON AMAZON FOR 61.79 THEN SIPPING AND HANDELING $76.95 BUT CAN GET IT AT AUTOZONE AUTOMOTIVE STORES FOR $39.95. BE CAREFUL !
3,Good but not better than All Music Guide,"Good, newer book of Blues rated recordings. With that said, it lacks the more variety of artists and listed CDs as found in All Music Guide."
3,Okay,"This is extensive and that's great. But the writers are so snobby. We're talking about the blues here, people. Folk music. Music of the people. Yet this feels like it was written by the kinds of people who write classical/art music books. How exactly can you become snobby about popular music? Yes, music criticism does require a certain level of snobbishness, but this goes far beyond that. They regularly reject admitted blues rock classics because they aren't pure blues. For one thing it's ridiculous to believe in ""pure"" forms of any kind of music, since music is never static. But to claim that records are bad because they aren't ""blues"" is ridiculous. The appropriate thing to do would be to say this is ""rock"" not ""blues"" and not pass judgement (if one was a blues critic who claimed no knowledge of rock)."
2,CONFUSING OPINIONATED MESS OF A BOOK,"These british chaps put down Lurrie Bell- which is one of the best blues players still alive. If Lurrie's life with its ups and downs and ability to finally pull himself out of abyss by the bootstraps is not ""the blues""- than what is?Then, there is omnipresent ""white men can't play blues"" byas throughout the book.You'd be better served by blues guides written by americans- AllMusicGuide, etc."
3,Is this 4oz or 16oz?,"Buying 2 bottles, one for home and one for work. Bottle size appears to be 16oz although picture shows 4oz. I say this because the retail price of $39 is the true retail price."
5,The Bible,"An absolute must for ocean engineers, specifically when dealing with waves and coastal structures. I am constantly going back to this book to use a reference for formulas and information."
5,Water Wave Mechanics for Engineers & Scientists (Advanced Series on Ocean Engineering-Vol2) (v. 2),"At first the books were lost somewhere in transit. So I mailed Amazon, my contact person was Sean B. The same day I wrote the customer service he placed a new order that Amazon refunded completely (it was on a sunday! I'm from Europa but I don't imagine Europeans working on a Sunday). A week later my books were delivered in Paramaribo, Suriname. So it was a perfect ending! Thanks a lot Amazon for you service. I understand that packages can get lost but the manner you solved this fault was outstanding.It's nice purchrasing stuff at Amazon!Kind regards,Frederic"
3,Book is okay,"Bought the book in good condition. Was good until the binder started to rip. Needed this book for a class I am taken have 3 more months with this book, hopefully it will hold. Probably should of got a better book, because I am going to use this book in the future, its a good reference book."
2,Not what all the other reviews crack it up to be.,"John Martyn is at his best when he keeps it minimal, so the emotion can shine through. Unfortunately, Phil Collins applies his tried and true 80s gloss production on this record, and it ends up sounding fairly dated as a result. If you dig John's more ambient stuff, like Solid Air and Bless The Weather, you probably won't like this record a whole lot.Previous reviewers note that the first track, ""Couldn't Love You More"", with Eric Clapton on guitar, is great. But if you want to hear a truly brilliant version of this song, pick up the reissue of John's album ""One World"" and listen to the live 1978 version of this track, which is on the bonus disc. It's just Martyn and his guitar, pouring his heart out in front of a stunned crowd. After you hear that version, you'll realize how ""Diet Coke"" this version of John Martyn is.But hey, if you wanna hear Phil Collins sing backup vocals, and play drums (without touching his cymbals much) then by all means...."
2,Eighties slick,"Being a huge fan of John Martyn I love practically all his work - especially his seventies output from 'Bless the Weather' to 'Grace and Danger'. In recent years I've come to really appreciate his more recent work as well, like 'The church with one bell' , 'Cooltide' and 'Heaven and Earth'. One of the missing pieces though was 'Glorious Fool'.I can't hide the fact that I was really disappointed, exemplified by the version of 'Couldn't love you more': a pale shadow of the glorious song it is on 'One World'. All tracks on 'Glorious Fool' suffer greatly from the slick production they've been subjected to, and to me it seems that this record sounds so much more dated than anything John Martyn did before or after.So, just two stars - I would probably bestow more stars on it had it been by anybody else, but this is by the great man himself. As you may have gathered, this is by far my least favourite John Martyn cd."
4,tastee,"Even Phil Collins, at the height of his popularity, and Eric Clapton throwing in some really tasty licks, couldn't help bring John to the masses and that is a shame. ""Glorious Fool"" is one of Martyn's easier albums to listen to for someone that is not familiar with his work. ""Couldn't Love You More"" is worth the price of the lp. It should have been a hit. At least we played it in a decent rotation at our station. There are a number of good tunes here.This is a very good album...by it!!!"
1,Thanks Arista! I'll Take The Stairs From Now On.,I would like to see Ken Griffey Jr hit this one over the fence at Safeco
2,a forgettable experience,Question: How does one respond to this early effort by soprano sax-man Kenny G?Answer: With the sound of one hand clapping.
1,"slow and weak, have never heard a worse album by Kenny.","This version of a master really doesn't show what a true saxophone genius he is. It is slow, unimaginative and repetitive. I would not recommend this to people who manufacture elevators."
2,Perhaps Kenny's Best!,"Amazing... Kenny's first three albums, Kenny G, G Force, and Gravity all show some very faint signs of quality music. They are certainly the only 3 albums that deserve more than 1 star as the rest of his stuff (which all sounds exactly the same) is strikingly unimaginative and can be summed up in 2 words: elevator muzak!this CD actually has a few moments of enjoyable R&B oriented music."
4,Great idea,"I received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised. I put it together, all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins, and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it. I have the Chicco Key-Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place, my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon. There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy/bulky, I hope I don't have any problems getting it in and out of my van. I can't wait to try it out at the mall."
2,baby trend sit and stand galaxy,"I was excited to find a double stroller that could fit through any and every doorway, that wasn't too heavy, easy to collapse, and that had an infant car seat attachment to work with any carseat. After 5 months of using it I found all of those things to be true. However, after the buckle for the bench seat got too easily pulled apart, I don't trust this product. Now, I have no way to secure my curious child in. It's very difficult to steer as well. The wheels are super easy for the child sitting/standing on the bench to try to 'help' you brake. Storage is very small and hard to get to. If you do store anything in the basket underneath, it can easily hit the wheels. It got us through till now, but I'm disappointed I'm going to have to find something else. Maybe great for an older child, just not for a 2 year old rambunctious boy and for a longer outting when you have to carry all the baby paraphanelia!"
2,had high hopes...,I loved the idea that my new baby and my 2 1/2 year old would both be happy in this. My 2 1/2 yr old loves standing/sitting in the back and will not get in a regular stroller seat so I thought this would be great. Unfortunately its been terrible. Its too long and this causes it to be really hard to turn. And the frame is a little delicate. With ours the right side got pushed forward a little and the whole thing pulled to the right so hard that it was a HUGE chore to push it. We called them and they told us to switch the front wheels which did not work. I finally laid it on its side and pushed the right side forward while bracing the other front wheel and that helped a little but its still really hard to push. The wheels are also small and make it difficult to get over cracks etc. in the sidewalk. And since we bought it while I was pregnant and its past 6 months the company was no help at all and suggested I just buy a new one! Riiiiight!
3,dull but realistic and touching,"when i first touched this book,which has great illustrations,i thought nothing of it.Who is Avi? I've never heard of him nor read any of his works before.The only thing about the book that lured me was the illustrations of Maggie,who looked so life-like like Britney Spears'.And i realised,this book may looked outdated,and its contents may seemed pretty dull,but if you carry on reading,you'll realised Avi had used great thoughts and a range of good vocabulary to express Maggie's thoughts about her father,whom she had not met for almost half a year.You'll realised that the feelings which all the characters felt seemed to be like those we've experienced before.Maggie is worried and confounded as silly questions ran through her mind:Will my father loved me as before even after my baby sister's arrival? Will Joanna(her dad's new wife)find me an eyesore?You see...If you're a bookworm,then you must go read this book...for it's been read by almost everyone worldwide!"
2,Blue Heron?,"First of all I thought the Heron was gray. Everytime Maggie did something, like when she was mad at herself for calling her dad stupid (which she didnt) or when she got mad at herself yet again when her dad blew up about the medicine, I just wanted to reach into the book and slap her! This book is not realistic! I mean who goes to a house starts yelling at them not to shoot the heron then goes wandering around inside their house! Who does that?!? It was a fairly well-written book not realistic."
5,Avi has done it again!,"This book was honestly one of the best books that I have ever read. Avi is great at coming up with interesting and diverse families. I could not believe how Avi could come up with caring and emotional Maggie, her raging father, Karen, Maggie`s responsible and loving step mother, and little Linda, who was caught up in the midst of all the fighting and emotion. From this book, you learned all about Maggie, the pressure that was put on her and her family and also the omen, the graceful heron. The question that you are left with at the end of the book is, does the Heron mean life or death? That`s why I liked this book, you must decide."
5,Avi has done it again!,"I thought ""The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"" couldn't be topped. I was proved wrong. This book delivers an amazing story that relates to the world today. Although the beginning is a little slow, you are soon drawn into a magical, yet down to earth story that adults and children alike will enjoy."
1,A classic ruined,"What happened to the Paul Bunyan I remember from my childhood? This version has been dumbed down, sweetened up and turned into drivel. There is virtually nothing left of the stories I remember from my youth. Since when did Paul fight Gumberoos, make a popcorn blizzard or put green lensed glasses on Babe? I borrowed this book from the library because my boys and I were reading about the mid 1800's when the American tall tale originated, but this book was a not a good representation of that heritage."
1,Pablum,"Saccharine cotton candy. About the only ""real"" thing left from the folk tales is Babe being found during a blue snow and staying blue. My grandkids' great great grandparents came from a logging past. Am I going to use this book to introduce them to heir own history? Absolutely not."
2,Book Purchase,This used book was a disappointment because of the odor associated with it. My seven-year-old grandson noticed right away and did not like it. We have aired it in the sun and it is now tolerable but not gone. Otherwise the condition was okay.
2,Unbelievable,"This book was reaching. The plot was weak and unrealistic. Rachel's boyfriend disappears 10 years ago and a man appears out of no where who happens to look just like her boyfriend's twin brother. the catch the guy is not her boyfriend and he owes her dad money a lot of money. so here goes, Is the guy her missing boyfriend? Is he a con man? Or is the unbelievable story true? Weak Weak Weak. also how long does it take to clean out a desk. Months?"
3,Just so-so,"I am a huge fan of Kay Hooper and always look forward to the release of a new book by her. This book was a huge disappointment for me, it is not one of her best.Rachel lost her fiance, Thomas, ten years ago in a plane crash. She has been mourning him this whole time, wondering if she will ever find love and be truly happy again. Suddenly, she notices a man hanging around that could pass for Thomas's twin, but anytime she tries to get close, he just disappears. Is it Thomas, or his ghost?I was hooked at this point and looking forward to another great story by Hooper. Unfortunately, the book went down hill from there. The plot was confusing and hard to follow, and Rachel was such a shallow character that I really didn't care what happened to her by the end of the book. Ms Hooper missed the mark on this one, and I am a fan."
2,An okay book,"The main problem with this book is that who cares about Rachel. She seems like one more whiny, spoiled upper middle class white girl. So her husband died, so her father died - boo hoo. Everyone in the world must now revolve around her. Who cares. I actually ended up enjoying the secondary romance between the banker and the secretary more. She should write that book."
2,Unusual at the very least,"This sure was an unusual book. A combination of a romance, thriller, maybe more ESP than paranormal but perhaps it was in it's 'jack of all trades' that it became a master of none. It was easy reading but the ending was too much to take...not to spoil it for those who have yet to read it....but the Adam/Tom ending? Puh-leeze! I did quite fancy Nick and Mercy though...and maybe it WAS because they were not fleshed out. Go figure huh?"
1,You call this a thriller?,"I'm disappointed. This is the second book I've read by this author and I didn't like this one either. The characters are not real to me. The situations are even worse. The whole idea of the dead boyfriend showing up later (is it him? isn't it?) and the mystery of the heroine's father and the money issues are great storylines, but not told effectively. I didn't believe for a minute that I was ""IN"" the story. Rachel was not my friend and I wasn't totally in love with Adam. After reading James Patterson, Patricia Cornwell and even Sue Grafton for years and years, Kay Hooper is a disappointment, I'm sorry to say."
1,"Did not live up to her previous work, After Caroline&Amanda","If you want to know why I purchased ""Haunting Rachel"" in hardback as soon as it was released, it was because of her two previous romance/mystery/suspense releases. Haunting Rachel was one of the strangest books I have read in a long time. Kay Hooper usually puts out 5 star books. This book was not even close to her previous work. The mystery was so stupid. And I did not like any of the characters. I could not figure out why this story was important? I carried on to the end. I read this book last year. I will get my next Kay Hooper from the library. Hope the next one is better."
4,Hauntingly beautiful,"This was the first Kay Hooper Romance Novel I read. I was ""smitten"" by the unusual story and loved the characters. The mystery of Adam, Thomas's look-a-like, and Rachel weave a tingling tale. I couldn't put it down. After reading this I recommend ""Finding Laura"", ""After Caroline"" and ""Amanda"". I liked these stories better than her Shadows & Evil series as they have more romance. I find her style in these much improved from her older novels written in the 80's, which I have since also read. I really wish the hero's and heroines of her stories weren't so perfect and beautiful and this story is almost accomplishes this issue. Some things really do get better with time. They are more normal in appearance and so you can concentrate more on their story and the mystery surrounding it without feel like your dealing with ""super heroes"". A good rainy day novel and still one of my favorites."
3,Within the first few pages you guess who did it!!!!,"I will not repeat what is any many of the reviews. The ""bad"" guy in this one is so obvious that you guess who it is right off and think; no there will be all sorts of twists and turns. NOPE! He sticks out like a sore thumb. The author is terrible at conversations. They are so bad that you can finish the sentences like bad B movies. He is a line from the HERO ""Jesus Christ on a Pony"" Give me a break. The sad thing is that she creates likeable, interesting characters that you want to get to know. No originality to the story that was even slightly believable"
4,Dynamic shoe-gazery rock,"I'll be honest and admit that I have no idea what these songs are about. The lyrics seem philosophical, conceptual and/or impressionistic; the music, though complex, is more directly tethered to known territory. Vocalist Stuart Livingston has a pleasingly melodic, almost sing-song delivery, which floats above the heavy-yet-ethereal instrumentals. This is an album full of contrast, from the dynamic range of the dense shoe-gazery rock, to the muscular rhythms that are both lightened and intensified by violin and cello. This time out the bands cut their songs down to under six minutes, but they're still long enough to develop crescendos that provide slowly-evolving, song-length contrast. It's a testament to the quality of the melodies, arrangements and performaing that this album can be enjoyed without being able to interpret the lyrics. [2007 hyperbolium dot com]"
3,A slight disappointment,"I bought this book because I wanted to see pictures of all the Dana Girls books. I can't believe that is the only series that isn't pictured fully! Only one book cover in each format of the Dana Girls is pictured. All the other series have every book pictured. That was very disappointing. It was fun to see new books added for this update of the author's previous book: Cherry Ames, Connie Blair, and Vicki Barr, but a letdown that the Dana Girls books were overlooked. I probably wouldn't have purchased this if I'd known."
2,Not very informative,"When I first bought this book, I was already collecting most of the series mentioned (There is a of them on the front of the book). The first series mentioned was Ruth Fielding. Four formats were listed, of the five formats that exist. This was the first warning. All through the book, John Axe combined formats, or did not list them at all. Although it gives some nice eronious information (i.e. information about the stratmeyer synicate), most of the contents can be found after a two mininte search on Google. At one point, I emailed John Axe with a few Beverly Gray formats that he did not include in the guide. In his reply, he called them ""anomalties"", and compared them with some misprints that he owned. As of yet, I have not found a good guide, except ones for individual series. ..."
1,poor quality,"Worked fine the first few months, but wore out quickly and I'm not rough on laptops by any stretch of the imagination. Be prepared for shipments to and from Texas, for warranty services, if you buy this or similar model Acer laptops. I'm staying away from Acer products in the future, and recommend you read the reviews and do the same."
1,Too small for thomas trains and doesn't fit the maxim shed,"Too small for thomas trains and doesn't fit the maxim shed. That really says it all, don't buy unless you have a complete maxim set, maybe it works with those?"
4,turntable for trains,My grandson was really excited over his new toy. So much taht he found the package under the tree and opened it before Christmas!
2,Cool but too small for Thomas trains,"I bought this in hopes of not needing the more expensive Thomas brand. However this will be the first time that buying cheaper was not better. It does not fit up to a roundhouse like the Thomas one so you need extra room to fit it on the table. But my biggest complaint is that it is very small. It can only accomadate 1 engine but so many Thomas and friends have extra parts-Gordon, James, Edward, etc- they all have coal tenders and won't fit on the part that spins around. My son gets frustrated about this especially since Gordon is his favorite. It will probably go over to the grandparents smaller train collection and we will add the Thomas turntable to our collection."
5,La Gran Ira...er...Vera!,"I, too, came to buy this wonderful disk via the review in Opera News. While the reviewer does say its length might be too much of a good thing, the operative phrase is ""good thing"". If you love opera, in spite of its sometimes wretched excesses, then you will be totally charmed by this send-up of all its gloriously wretched conventions, lovingly spoofed, beautifully (mostly) sung.I wish I'd been in that audience, an audience which obviously understood the layers upon layers of meaning -- listen for the undercurrent during Kavatina Turner's ""battles"" to get every little thing just the way she wanted it, listen for Sylvia Bills's lament about the few notes she had at the end of her career...oh, what the heck, just listen, because you'll have a hard time catching it all the first time through. And you will watch and listen over and over, I guarantee it!"
1,awful,"I love opera and spoofs of opera. BUT this one was simply terrible, it was not funny, it was unlistenable, it was stupid. I would be happy to sell it for 25 cents."
5,Best of Toonces & Friends,Toonces & friends was so funny! It's a must own!!! Needs to be re-released and in DVD format. I would certainly buy it for myself and for friends. It would make a great stocking stuffer.
1,rush hour 3( widescreen and full-screen),i bought this movie not long ago and we went to watch it but it would not play in any of the dvd players we got so we wound up buying the movie triligy out at wal-mart.
3,Rush Hour 3(2007),"Rush Hour 3(2007) does manage to please, but the magic is gone. This Rush Hour movie raises the violence and some of the storytelling is contrived. This Rush Hour movie experiments with vulgar humor! Inspector Lee talks about ordering a porno film in one scene. Chan is forcefed some awful dialouge in the movie. Rush Hour 3 takes place in Paris, France, yet it is a rehash of the first film. This is typical Hollywood product. Still, this movie is worth a rental or buying on DVD and Blu Ray if you have the cash! Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker return as Lee and Carter. I think Brett Ratner is the ""real star"" of this movie! The film's trailer uses a record scratch when someone tells a lame joke! The ""Chinglish"" scene was funny. There's rumors that a Rush Hour 4 is in the works. Rush Hour 3 is fun, but not the best Rush Hour installment."
5,I love Jackie Chan,"I could watch this move a thousand times and it still would not be enough. I laugh everytime I see it start to finish! More Jackie, more Chris!!"
2,Rush Hour 3 Definately 3rd In Quality,"I like comedy. I enjoyed the first Rush Hour, and also the second. However, I was completely ""let down"" by the third. Chris Tucker has begun to totally emote (over act) and has lost his ability to be funny. Tucker's attempts in this 3rd venture tend to be completely aimed at crass sex inuendo. Jackie Chan seems weary of Tucker's attention grabbing and for all his fighting skills, hardly ever win's his fights. At this rate, if there is a Rush Hour 4, it should probably go direct to TV, skipping the theatres."
2,Rush Hour Don't.,"I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was, (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc. I hope to see more movies from Tucker and Chan in their separate endeavors, but not in any more Rush Hour sequels. It's just too tired. I recommend a rental, but not a purchase."
5,Best Comedy Ever!!!,"This is the best comedy movie I have ever seen ! It was amazing! There was never a moment when I was not cracking up laughing! It was hilarious, and Chris Tucker is the funniest dude ever! GET THIS MOVIE!! It is amazing!! I hope that there is a Rush Hour 4!"
1,I do not believe this to be a piece of American culture,"This is a far cry from the first successful opus, and further the previous success of Eddy Murphy. The story is bland, ultra-conventional and impossible to believe. The sub-zero degree of culture is achieved by the laudatory comments of the French popular papers ""Journal du Dimanche"" and ""Parisien"" that qualify this disaster, the back of the jacket of the DVD, ""hilarious"" and very funny"".Furthermore, if this kind of American cinema had some finesse, he would have been able to make fun of French with intelligence. The criticism of France through the Atlanticist recurring themes of cowardice - our banned sacrifice in Iraq is still difficult to be understood the hawks bushists is vulgar and stupid.No-sense screenplay, actors alongside the game, total lack of humour, caricature of the American subculture: 0"
2,All the funny scenes are already in the trailer!,"After watching this movie, I realized all the funny scenes are already in the trailer! The rest of the movie is boring. This is one of the worst film staring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.It's still worth renting so that you can compare it with the other two installments."
1,Anti-Americanisms ruin comedic mood,"My family and I are big Jackie Chan fans, and we own most of the DVDs Jackie has released in the U.S. Unfortunately, anti-American bigotry hits you in the face with sledge hammer force on three different occasions in this movie. No correction or different point of view is ever shared with the person who makes the comments. The anti-American bigot apparently never changes his mind in the movie (but he gets to kill someone so he can be more like his perception of Americans). Do yourself a favor: do not buy this DVD until you have viewed a rental version of it. After the anti-American stereotyping began, no one in my family ever smiled again throughout the remainder of the movie."
1,"An ""international"" comedy by some really ugly Americans","That's about all I have to say about this piece of garbage. Oh, one more thing: Chris Tucker is awful; he is so lucky that the Rush Hour movies exist, since he does nothing else."
1,A huge disappointment,"If you liked the first two Rush Hour movies, just pretend this one doesn't exist. You aren't missing much. A lot of the chemistry between Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan just falls flat this time around, and most of the jokes have already been done--and done better--in the previous movies. Don't waste your time on this one when there are plenty of more interesting movies you could be watching."
3,"Not as good as the first two, but still worth a watch","Definitely not as good as the first two, but worth a few quality laughs. Jackie Chan still surprises me. Not his best performance, but I can't stop enjoying his movies regardless."
3,Getting old,Was not so impressed with this movie. The first 2 where ok. This was just a chance for the producers to make some extra cash. It wasn't so funny like the first two.
3,It Was Okay.,"The Movie was not bad. Personally, I found this to be more of comedy than action. I was expecting a little more action and the plot to be longer. Other than that, it was alright."
2,Bad Way To End the Franchise,"This was the worst Rush Hour, with Rush Hour 2 being my favorite. It was rushed, written badly and too short. The only good things about it were the beginning and the city of Paris.Hollywood will continue to release trash as long as people buy into it.Rent it."
5,They did it AGAIN~!!!,"If you are a fan of Jackie Chan, and now Tucker, get this DVD~!!! Its NEVER get old, and fun funny as always~!!!! WHY some people come in here and whine about movie they do not like??? Well, then go away~! This movie is for FUN ENTERTAINING COMEDY lovers ONLY~!!! GO JACKIE~!!!!! He is the BEST~!!!"
5,Good Entertainmant,if you enjoyed rush hour 1 and 2 you will enjoy 3! Its exactly what you should expect from the rush hour series. Buy the dvd!
3,Fun for fans but not as much fun as the previous two,"RUSH HOUR 3 (movie theatre): B minus (After almost ten years they're back but even though it has some funny moments they aren't as good as the previous two. If you're a loyal fan, it's worth checking out but there are better comedies, old and new.)"
2,Anyone who give it 5 stars is 'challenged',"The first two were okay, and some of the action was in this one was okay, but the basic story is ever so stupid.*Spoiler*I'll try not to give too much away, but there's a super important list of 13 names that need to get to the proper authorities. Unfortunately it's tattooed on a woman. Of course you want to save the woman, but why can't they send the list by some other means. Chris Tucker's character has a nice car and nice clothes, but he doesn't have a camera on his cell phone?And Jackie Chan's character still works for the Chinese government, but he can't just write down the 13 names (they're in Chinese) and send them off to a couple of people??Ughh!"
1,It Misses,"This film is nowhere near as entertaining as the first two in the series.The weakest link in the first two films was always Chris Tucker, who is just embarrassing. It seems like he is trying to be a low-budget Eddie Murphy, and fails.Fortunately in Rush Hour 3 he is older and a bit less hyper. Age perhaps is also showing in Jackie Chan, who is always fun to watch, but his stunts are less impressive this time around.The problem here is either in the writing or the directing. The film just seems to be a series of (not very funny) comedy sketches strung together, with the actors just doing through the motions. Max von Sydow delivers his usual quality, but the resolution of his character is just a repeat from the first film and not a surprise.The most original element seems to be the fighting on the Eiffel Tower.The absolute high point is the collection of bloopers at the end."
2,ok,I saw the movie in theathers and it was good. so i bought it. but when i watched it looked like a bad bootleg movie that you got from joe on the corner.
1,Big Disappointment after Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2,"In this movie, in our opinion, the movie makers made Jackie Chan's character out to be a real loser in his role of law enforcement officer. He pursued and caught the man who had just shot the ambassador, and then let him walk away. The fact he considered this man to be like a brother should not have interfered with him performing his duty. Later in the film, Lee tells this man that the reason he had not shot him was because he (Lee) is not an assassin. What a bunch of hooey! My husband and I really enjoyed Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2, so we thought 3 would be at least as good. Wrong! Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment for us."
3,Good quality disc...so-so movie.,"I guess my title says it all. Not nearly as good as the first two. Tired, drawn-out plot/theme."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Pretty much the definition of a mediocre film, Rush Hour 3 accomplishes what it sets out to do with just enough humor to make it watchable; one of those movies that you'd be happy to sit through on an airplane, it's not worth spending money on but you could do worse."
4,Mindless entertainment,"3.5 stars. I'm afraid I was prepared not to like this movie. I heard so much of how much of a disappointment it was. And it is...but there is still a little charm left with this comedic duo. But please let the series end here. I can't even recap the plot because, but it truly doesn't make any sense. Everything is a matter of convenience. They always walk to the right place and there is always some minor character telling them where they need to go next. The climatic ending looking like a combination of the first two movies and well, the plot is just bad. Actually, the script is bad. But I did laugh quite a bit. Go figure."
4,The best move for 2007,"If want to see a very funny move ,just look at this move.Rush Hour (Special Edition)"
4,Love It.,"Personally I don't care about who said what but Christmas 2007, I was home alone. My kids were with their friends and father; My mom was with my brother and I was alone and I wanted a movie to keep me going and I got this movie and liked it! It kept me laughing, occupied and I rather liked the plot and all! I loved Rush Hour 2 but I also like this as well. The opening scene makes me holla."
5,Do You Understand The Words That Are Coming Outt Of My Mouth,I Know i should of put my title on the first but whats wrong with this one. i think the third movie is just as good as the others these movies will become classics. The only way i see people not watching more rush hour movies(if they Make More) is if Jackie chan and chris tucker are'nt in them. then it would suck. but hopefully they won't screw up anymore if they do make more. all inif you have not seen this movie then you should all this was awesome.
3,A Bit Disappointing!,"After Rush Hour 2 (the best of the 3 films), this film was by far inferior. Chris Tucker seemed to lack the energy of the other two films and the plot of this film was extremely weak. Jackie Chan is his usually entertaining self with his usually death defying stunts. The whole movie revolves around Lee's friend (though he calls him his brother) trying to kill anyone who knows the identity of the head of the Chinese Tongs.The scenes shift from Chicago to Paris, where the secret to the Tongs lies. This movie has a woman assassin who throws sharp objects at the boys. She is nowhere as intriguing as the female assassin from movie #2.The movie also seems to end abruptly and lacks to comic interlude from the ending of the first two movies. As usual during the credits there are some funny outtakes which are funnier than anything in the movie itself."
4,"not bad,not bad at all (3.5/5)","from all the negative things i had heard about this movie,i expected itto be awful.thankfully,that wasn't the case.this movie is actually notbad.i didn't find it as funny as either the first or second one,butthere were still some pretty funny moments.Jackie Chan gets to loosenup and show a bit of his silly side.Chris Tucker is funny,as usual.again there's lots of action of course.the fights are pretty good.ChrisTucker displays some good martial arts moves in this one.and JackieChan has his usual great movies,although he seems a bit restrained inthis one.there is one mild scene of female nudity,but very brief andnothing tasteless.i didn't quite like it as much as the previous twomovies,but i still enjoyed it.for me,Rush Hour 3 is a 3.5/5"
5,Entertaining Movie,Worth watching entertaining. Language too rough at times/overdone. Dont let the kids hear it too much swaering that looses its effect.
2,All sizzle and not stake.,"When I picked up this book I'll admit I had rather high hopes. It starts off strong, giving you alot of atmosphere, and then it gives you more atmosphere. And then it gives you more atmosphere. There isn't any real meat to this book. The character creation section is limited telling you that creating a Mafia character is pretty much like making a vampire minus the powers. And while there is several references to Vampire and Werewolf Mafia guys, there is not short bio's of any, like you'd find in a clan book. I was hoping that it would cover some other types of gangs, Yakuza, Tongs, ect. Instead it confined it's to the Mafia during it's heyday. Long story short. If you've seen The Godfather, Goodfellas, ect. you don't need this book. If you haven't seen these moves you'd have a better time watching the movies than reading this book."
3,Nothing you wouldn't expect.,"I picked this book up in the sale section of the local library, long before the new series premiered, or the old series was out on DVD. We're talking mid/late-90s, here.While I ""enjoyed"" the book, there was nothing to be enthralled with between the covers. It delivers the same general style of action as the show and movie, with a few shifts and contradictions to show for it. There was a hint of sexuality to it (how can there not be with Starbuck around?), but nothing beyond a mention-in-passing of a woman's figure, so even that wasn't a new thing.If you like the old series, you'll like this book. While I am fond of the old, I am much more a fan of the new, though I did grow up on reruns of the old BSG. But this is just another book about a TV show universe."
2,NOT made in USA,I was looking for good quality toys made in America.As I read [...]about I got every impression they make their own toys to sell.When the item arrived it has a stamp on it `made in China'.Very disappointed. If you want made in America look elsewhere.
1,Poor quality,"This would have been a good toy for our one old year, if they didn't come already chipped. Poor quality build with glue sowhing and sides already chipping even before we unpacked them!"
4,Wonderful First Vehicles Set,"I bought these for my son when he turned one. They are solid and sturdy unlike a Fisher Price plastic set of vehicles I bought for him, and he loves them. I gave this toy four stars, because he likes the propeller on the plane, but the plane doesn't roll smoothly the way the car and the truck do. But the amount of playing he has done with the car and the truck over the last three months more than makes up for his lack of interest in the plane."
5,Wonderful vehicles for toddlers,"My son received these as a gift, and he adores them. He's 21 months old and we've assembled a respectable little collection of vehicles over the months, but he is always drawn to these. So are other kids who come over to play. The car and dump truck are just plain appealing, and the plane -- with its moving propeller -- is really cool. All three have that can't-put-your-finger-on-it appealing quality that makes kids (and adults) want to hold these in their hands and scoot them around. They're really substantial, too, and I can't imagine them breaking."
1,Horrible quality!,"Melissa & Doug are great at greenwashing Chinese imports. So they are wood toys, big deal! Parents concerned enough to seek out wooden toys for their kids, care about quality, which these vehicles sorely lack. Where do I start, with the sloppy paint, mis-shapen plastic tires, dull colors (nothing like the picture)....I am staying away from M&D from now on. They're a step up from plastic beeping & blinking junk, but that's not saying much."
5,My Grandson Loves these!,"It took about a minute for my grandson (just 10 months old) to find that the back of the airplane fits his mouth just fine! He has been rolling the truck around, and in a few minutes discovered the propeller and began turning it. This toy set is close to indestructable, and reminds me a lot of the old-style toys I recall from the 50s... big blocky, solidly built, definitely child-proof. I am so glad I found these for his first visit from Santa!"
3,"Ran small, decent product","The shorts were smaller than expected. They JUST fit me, and the white ones are very see through. Im guessing another color other than white may be better"
3,Gray might be thinner than the black POR-15,"I have used the black POR-15 before with good results, and I got the gray to try to make it easier to see later where my black topcoat was.The can of gray POR-15 that I got was noticeably thinner than the black that I have used. Their customer support agreed that this happens sometimes. It was so thin that it would be pretty useless on a vertical surface. It did eventually harden up OK but I needed two coats to get a level surface on rough metal."
5,gets the job done,this Ipod Charger works well for the price listed. its great for taking places whether travelling or whatever else you may be doing. I have had no issues with the charger and use it on a regular basis. It's a solid investment at only 20 dollars.
2,Poor Quality,"I bought one of these for my Lexus GS aftermarket Eclipse Head Unit.Several Problems:- Bad fit. Tried assemble parts, they dont fit together.- Bad finish. Color and grain dont match the Lexus dash. Look cheap.- NOT a double DIN kit. This is a single DIN kit. You have to cut it with dremel or some other tools to convert for double DIN use.I ended up buying an double DIN installation kit from Carson Toyota, which is made by Lexus in Japan. Problems solved. Perfect fit and finish, OEM look."
5,An Excellent Introduction to Contemporary Debates,"Tessa Morris-Suzuki offers a overview of recent scholarship regarding changing Japanese notions of nation, culture, race, gender, civilization and citizenship, with a particular and distinctive emphasis on the spatial and temporal dimensions of these concepts. Her writing is lucid and nuanced, and her treatment of these topics is both accessible to a general audience and of interest to specialists in the field."
5,Perfect!,"This book is no longer in print, so I was very thankful to find this copy available. It was a withdrawn book from the Toledo library, but as a librarian I know this doesn't mean it's a bad book. It just didn't check out very often! This book is still is perfect condition and I am very glad to have found it! Thanks."
3,There are better choices,"I've looked over numerous walking books, and cannot really refer this one. It is useful, but only in a few places. Most of the book reads like one-page motivational articles out of a magazine like, well, Prevention. Particularly irksome is the article on Walking Marathons: no training schedule, just continuous promotion of a specific fund-raising group.There are training schedules elsewhere in the book, but they are geared more to the walking athlete then you and I.Okay, so what's the alternative? Try Dr. Mort Malkin's book,Aerobic Walking, also available from Border's/Amazon. Despite the bland title, it's a realistic plan for health thru walking.(And if you want a training schedule for Marathons, look up the Walking section at About.com. Lots of good stuff there.)"
3,"Running Wild, but......","It is hard to believe it, but their time has gone. This album comes straight from R'N'R head. There is no one else but him here. Album has couple great songs, but overall it is boring. If you are a real fan like me of his previous work , you will be disappointed here. This is more something like routine(it needed to happen) than oriented to hook up old and even new fans. Explore his previous work from Under Jolly Rogger thru Rivalry."
2,Simon Kenton : Kentucky Scout,"Being an avid Simon Kenton fan, I was really looking forward to this book but found it quite boring. I suppose after reading Allan Eckert's ""Frontiersman"", any accounting of the life of Simon Kenton pales in comparison."
1,Hypocritical,"I question the fact that the author calls herself a lifelong cat lover, since, in the introduction, she readily admits to having given away more than ten felines in her household because she was moving across the country. This made me seriously doubt the integrity of the author, as any true cat lover would NEVER do such a thing. It made me wonder whether she saw them as living beings and members of the family, as my cats are to me, or just ornaments that can be cast aside if they become inconvenient. Perhaps I'm cynical, but the book just smacked of a means to make money for an author whose work is fairly pedestrian. In regards to the content, it covered such mundane matters as history, naming your cat and the like. If you want books written by apparently genuine cat lovers, I would suggest Patricia Telesco's book Cat Magic and Daisy Pepper's Spells For Cats. They cover pretty much the same content and seem to come from a place of genuine care and concern for our feline friends."
1,Thank goodness for Amazon reviews!,"I was planning on buying this book, but decided not to after reading a few reviews which revealed that the author had given away at least ten cats of her own, using the old ""moving away"" excuse. Anyone who can do that is obviously not a person who has a true affinity, care, or respect for cats - or any animal. True witches have a bond with animals - our brethren - and Dunwich obviously fails the test. I won't be reading this or any other of her books."
3,I think you all are reviewing the wrong cd,"They have this listed as barry manilow greatest hits vol 2 but,lets hang on is not on number2 and also there is no duet with ronnie milsap on this one.lets get this straight is this greatest hits or not."
4,Great retro intro to embroidery,"This is a great kit to introduce someone to embroidery. It's young and hip, but still gives you the information and tools you need to get started. The instruction book is pretty small, but has a few basic stitches to get you started, with good descriptions and how-to pictures. You'll be addicted to embroidery in no time!"
4,Really liked it....,This is a great kit for beginners. I sewed my first patterns easily and plan to do more.
5,excellent for the beginner,"I never even held a needle before buying the stitch-it kit, but the designs looked cute and her website seemed very friendly, and the price seemed fair for having all the equipment to do two projects right away.The best part about the guide are her instructions. I have a horrible time with written instructions most of the time, but the pictures and descriptions really worked for me, and I finished my first towel over a long weekend vacation -- much faster than I thought I would, and it looked great. I made a second towel for a stocking stuffer last Christmas, and received many compliments on it.This kit gave me such confidence that I've gone on to do cross-stitch, which always intimidated me before, and even doll-making.I would highly recommend this as a gift for a friend, or to keep and enjoy."
5,It's True! It's true!,"I am a 100% beginner. This kit is too much fun. I feel like an artist! Everything you need to get started. Just don't scorch both of your tea towels like I did ;)! The patterns are so cute. If you're considering buying this, do it. You'll have a blast."
2,It's all just Hype.,"I know this ""kit"" has recieved many ""oh so great reviews."" Most is just alot of hype. This kit does contain some nice patterns. Most of everything to learn in this kit you can learn for free on the book's website, or just online in general. I got sucked in to buy this as a recommendation as a beginner in stitching...plus because of the ""great"" reviews. I've not even used any of the patterns."
4,A great start for beginners,"This kit is a wonderful starter kit for a beginner trying to start on embroidery. The booklet is well written and easy to follow. The only suggestion I have is that when you order this kit buy some additional colors of embroidery floss, the colors that come with the kit are somewhat limited."
5,Love it!,"I've been oooh-ing and ahhh-ing over Jenny Hart's website for ages and saying to myself that I'll order the kit or some of her patterns eventually. I finally did, and I can't beleive I didn't order it sooner. Her instructions are simple, all that you need to get started is in the kit, and her patterns are a lot of fun and don't need to take hours and hours unless you want to add your own detail (which she encourages!). If you're at all intimidated by embroidery, get this kit and it will all make sense (and you'll want to embroider everything!)"
4,An interesting book!!!,"This is an interesting book. I recommend it to anyone looking for spiritual answers. You may not agree with everything -- and that's OK. But take whatever you get from this book and simply make it yours. You don't have to become a follower of Kabbalah to put some of the ideas into practice. Try it. You may like it.Also recommended: ""What Did Jesus Really Say, How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information]"" by Peter Cayce"
4,Kabbalah for Beginners,"This book, on the whole, was fairly informational, yet is was a little vague, at times. The author seems to know the subject matter, however I was disappointed the book was so small. I do want to emphasize that as I began to read it, I felt light piercing through me, if that makes sense. The author made some very provocative points and I have read the book several times, so I guess that shows that I do really like it, inspite of the vague parts and the brevity."
1,Look elsewhere for enlightenment...,"I found the writing in this book to be quite stilted and extremely difficult to read. As a complete novice in the Kabbalah I found this book raised more questions than it answered.If you enjoy re-reading the same sentence 5 or 6 times in order to get the gist of it, then this is the book for you. Otherwise just say no and find another resource.I did like the photo on the cover though..."
2,Was Disappointed,"Bought this book because I was interested in learning about Kaballah. However, after reading the book I only have learned a brief history of Kabbalah. Still have no clue exactly on what Kabbalah is or the principles. This book had a high rating by previous readers so I am disappointed I didn't seem to ""learn"" what they must of learned about Kabbalah. Almost like this is a book to read before you want to know or understand what Kabbalah is."
5,indispensable !,"I am a beginner in Kabbalah I wanted to say that i just did not find such a book among all kabbalah books i could find until now in my location. What makes the difference is that this book speaks about yourself, not about abstract or philosophical concepts. This book can change your life !I am not a native English speaker, so please forgive my English that is not very correct. But maybe the fact I let you know that some persons are actually reading this book even in stranger tongue will indicate how valuable it is considered in our location, much more than a simple book ..."
4,Fuzzy little horse,Horses I love Horses I don't own any of my own but I love collecting these small Horses there fun and great to have around kids love them too these little horses are easy to take care of as long as I don't do much with them they will last a long time I would say same goes with the bigger Horses you can find on Amazon like that large White Grace Horse on here I have one of those too I think its very creative to even name some of these horses you can get here if you really want too its a great way to use your imagination I do it all the time.
2,"Apparently rushed to press, many errors keep you guessing.","Text and examples full of typos, omissions and assumptions. Examples are impossible to load. Spent valuable time trying to resolve errors in examples. If you haven't bought it, don't! Author owes everyone that bought it a follow-up with the corrections."
2,Little information poorly presented,"The one-line summary says it all. Do not buy this one. A much better book is Developing JavaBeans Using VisualAge for Java, by Nilsson and Jakab."
2,"Good explanations, but faulty, incomplete examples!","This book does a good job in explaining the special approach of programming with Visual Age for Java. This should help the reader to use Beanbox and Visual Composition Editor better. However, throughout the book gives the impression of having been scribbeld together in a great hurry. The examples are full of typos and the reader has to conclude from the context, that some steps are missing altogether. I'm sure, nobody has tested, whether the step-by-step-descriptions of the examples in the book really enable to get the examples running.My recommendation: Wait for an enhanced second edition."
3,WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE WILD GREEN YONDER ?,Illustrations on every page will delight the children. Read about what raccoons and skunks eat. Read about 3 young animals and their curiosity beyond the skirts of their mommas.Some good repetion for children to hear.
5,One of the Best Movies,"As someone who has seen and owns literally thousands of movies, I can say that is one the best movies that I have seen. The story just keeps going and going. There was never a dull moment. The acting was absolutely great, every one of the actors. The first reviewer gave the movie one star out of five, but he/she only saw the movie for less than 15 minutes. I saw the movie on Apple TV and liked it so much that I bought DVD copy afterwards. This is the kind of movie people pay to see and have a good time!"
1,It hurt my ears!,Bad language hurt my ears and poor acting hurt my consciousness...I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. Wish Amazon would give refunds!!
1,Don't buy this,In the picture it shows several toobs and accessories. The only thing I got when it came in was the long yellow toob for 11.81 after shipping charges. Nothing else came with it. They try to trick you and make you think you are getting everything shown.
3,Toob-A-Trail,"I only received one tube, which cost less than the shipping and handeling 3.99 for the tube - 6.95 shipping + .46 tax for a grand total of 11.40. I called Pet Smart and they sent the other items at no charge due to the add showing all of the other items that were not sent. Thanks for your care and concern.V/RDon"
4,Highly recommended to the fellow rock/hard rock/metal fans.,"But why pimp this title Irish? The band broke up mere months after the album was released! How good could it be??As a fluke, I originally picked up this CD a few months ago in a thrift store. On the first listen, was blown away how heavy this album is - how good it sounded - how the vocals resonated - the lyrics.... Yea, it is that good. Highly recommended to the fellow rock/hard rock/metal fans."
4,Book and Cd,My three year enjoys listening to Caps for Sale while driving and turning the pages of the book. The music is quirky but catchy and my daughter has picked up the words and sings along.
3,Caps for Sale,"Caps for Sale was an interesting book. I read it to my little brother one night. He is learning to sign and enjoyed signing all the colors and hat over and over. I feel that this would be an excellent book for a 3 or 4 year old. They will enjoy how the monkeys copy everything. I feel that this book could even teach the kids that if you use your head you can get what you really want, because think if the peddler would have just noticed that the monkeys were doing exactly what he was doing. He could have got his hats back alot easier. It's definitly a good childrens book."
3,Not a Big Book,"Teachers, I was not sent a Big Book. The seller promptly refunded my money and let me keep the book. Although I didn't get what I had anticipated, I would not hesitate to give this seller another chance.Great story! This is a classic."
3,Caps For Sale,I was disappointed at the size of the book though the words were legible for my sons reading. I was fooled by what was shown in the advertisement
4,Caps For Sale,This book was about a peddler who was trying to sell caps throughout his town. But as he went through the town no one was buying any of his caps to anyone in town . So he decided to go to the country and attempt to sell caps there. When he got to the town he was very tired so he sat under a tree and took a nap but when he woke up they were gone. Then he looked up into the tree and saw that a bunch of monkeys had taken his caps. And the peddler got very mad and started to yell at the monkeys. The lesson this book teaches is that you shouldn't get really mad if you lost something and cant find it. The age level for this book is probably around ages 4-7 years old. I thought that this was a very good book and that it teaches a very good lesson about not getting mad if you lose something.
4,Delightful,"No matter how many years go by, we never get tired of this delightful book. The story is adorable and kids can relate in many ways. I am giving it to our ""next generation"" of kids in our family. Great response!"
1,A mixed book!,"The book was pieced together wrong. It turned out to be a board book. The pages were upside down at times. I have this book at school, and it's not supposed to look like that."
5,Great Children's Book!!,My son just loves this book!! This is a very entertaining story and I highly recommend this to any parent. I had to purchase our own copy because we checked it out from the library so many times! A book both adults and children will like!
5,Tss! Tsss! Tsss!,Couldn't believe I found this title digitally after growing up with it. Great short story that a child of any age will love. I remember growing up and my mom making the monkey sounds shaking her finger at the same time. Will definitely bring a smile to any kids face!
5,A classic,"My three-year-old loves this book. We borrowed it from the library and she liked it so much, we had to buy it. She loves the surprise ending!"
3,disappointed,"I love this book. I read it over and over when I was young.The only problem is the hat colors. The colors are: red-OK,Blue-looks like gray,brown is yellow NOT brown... And gray- OK...When I read it to my Grandkids, I have to remember to say ""yellow"" instead of brown. I always get corrested by my 2 1/2 yr old grandson....Great story but not happy about cap colors... : ("
5,A timeless classic,What a wonderful book. I remember loving this book when I was a young child and it thrills me now to read it to my son. Just see if your kids don't get up and act like monkeys!
2,it's ok,"candee jay's debut album is not at all ""electrifying"".the producers may be the same as the great alice deejay but the album lacks the thoughtfullness that was put into the debut album ""who needs guitars anyway"" ablum, by alice deejay.candee jay has only really had 1 big hit in england, which was ""if i were you"", the single ""back for me"" only just managed to scrape into the english top 20 and the last single ""lose this feeling""(the best track on the album) did not even chart.if i were to pick an album by alice deejay or candee jay, then i would always choose alice deejay.at least that album had a bit of diversity."
1,spanish twaddle,"Like many modern people, Balada appears to greatly suffer from ADD. He can start something with great promise but after a few minutes sounds as if he's lost interest in his composition. To shore up this challenge to his inspiration, he moves from theme to theme, never developing anything substantial, often dallying and meandering uselessly. He employs novel ""modern"" effects to divert attention to the fact that nothing is happening. Naxos makes a big deal about his use of ""folk"" material, but Balada implements these poorly. They sound like sketches for a 40s travelogue with a pinch of Ives and a glissando of ""modern"" effects here and there.As insubstantial as Balada is, the Barcelona Symphony is well below even Naxos standards. They have an overly tart reed and string sound lending an unpleasantly nasal atmosphere to each work. Aeschgbacher's tempos are suitable aimless."
5,I think this is the best book ever written about Vyacheslav Ivanov.,"Russian Symbolism seems to be a peculiar literary movement at first glance. But Russian Symbolists inherited very much from German romantics. I'm also a student of Russian Symbolism, especially of Ivanov's heritage, like the author. I was captivated by this book. This fascinating book has become for me a model of my research (especially the chapter 10 is splendid!): a ""mirror"" of what I think about Ivanov. An excellent book both for specialists and for simple literature lovers."
1,"Not a ""real"" writer.","This book is totaly worthless. Most of the writing is either illegal and punishable by real jail time or stupid pipe dreams. The author, who gets his material from submissions from ""who knows who"" writes of breaking into someones property and damaging their vehicle by tampering with the engine. First this is very dangerous, illegal, not funny, and you would need a key to get inside the car to open the hood in modern cars.He writes of re-wiring an elevator to make it go to different floors when the buttons are pushed. How many people could really do this and even if they could when? Reading this is a waste of time."
5,"totaly halurious,works to","ive written this man with some off the wall stuff that i done in the past,and with stories that ive heard,to my suprise he has written back to thank me for writing,and used my ideas in his books. truely funny stuff.read on my dear friends.the flying hawaiian."
5,good viewing.,Birthday present for my Hubby. He is enjoying it very much. Will watch it many times over. Glad I bought it for him.
5,Sounds Beautiful,"Soundtrack from the film of the same name. A collection of great tracks, including one of the most beautiful love songs ever.Worth every penny!"
4,Academic......but still useful,"I will agree with the other reviewer that some of this is very academic. Cawelti, though, dissects the subject well. If you are used to reading college-level literary criticism, this will not pose a problem at all. You can also skip over these parts fairly easily and make it to the bits where the author explains what elements make up a western, either in film or in print. If you're interested in what makes a western story tick, then i would recommend this book. I haven't seen the newer revised edition, but that one should be your best bet."
5,great marriage material,This teaching offers both sexes some valuable insights into each other and marriage. It has greatly helped our relationships and several others in our study group. I highly recommend this study for all marrieds and singles alike.
3,Well I'll be Bummed,"This is brilliant! My partner Tristan told me about this book sometime ago, I was a bit reluctant to go out and buy it, but I'm glad I did!This has improved our bedroom activity incredibly! Go Buy It!"
5,Anal pleasure 100%,"I think this is one of the best books to help a person get intouch with their inner feelings. I think If you want to have anal sex, buy this book, it gives great ways to experience it in its fullest!"
4,Be holistic,"This book provides interesting, healthy insight into an often neglected part of the body. Taking a holistic approach to total health: physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual, it all works in unison and none can be neglected. I recommend this book for anyone interested in health, sexuality, and just anyone who desires a more indepth knowledge of the body."
3,"Good book, bad Kindle edition","The book itself is helpful, well-written, and definitely worth the read. The kindle version, however, contains a frustrating amount of grammatical errors. Within the first few pages of the Intro, I encountered missing spaces, lowercase words at the beginnings of sentences, and even omitted letters. For as much as the kindle version costs, I feel that this is unacceptable."
4,Highly Recommended,I wrote my book about the American Civil War which is The Marylanders: Without Shelter or a Crumb. Mr. Rehehan's book is essential reading for persons interested in John Brown but also to researchers of American political northern extremism before the outbreak of the Civil War. I strongly recommend his book. My book examines the effect of northern political extremism on a Maryland family. Some of the extremists Mr. Renehan documented are mentioned in my book. They became associated with the Lincoln administration during the Civil War. Follow the link to my book:The Marylanders: Without Shelter or a Crumb
2,Info For Buy,"Be Careful because this one isn't the soundtrack of the tv-series Six Million Dollar Man but a disco music from the theme of the series, if you don't love the disco music maybe this one is not for you, when i buy this cd i think: This is the soundtrak from the Tv series, but when i listen it i understand that isn't itThanks, is a good cd but not the Six Million Dollar Man Music"
2,Too basic,"This book is just for graphic designers with no prior knowledge about the subject or someone who wants an introduction to IA. The ""practical"" side of the book is just some basic diagrams o how to's (example: you can use post it pads to build site maps!)."
1,There's no there there,"I've never given below three stars in a review. This book was worthless to me. There is no useful framework or process described. There are no helpful implementation tips. There is no help on tools to use. There are no checklists. It's all just generic information with no real context, flow, or underlying structure tying it together.About me: I'm neither an expert nor a total novice in this area. I have basic business, technical, and project management skills. If someone has *none* of these skills, maybe they'll think this book is worthwhile."
2,Great product,"I've been trying for a long time to locate miniature playing cards. It's impossible to find them anywhere. One day I decided to try Amazon, and was very pleased to find the ones I ordered. It was very easy to order, and exactly what I was looking for. They arrived very quickly, even though it was during the holidays when everything is busier than normal. Needless-to-say, I am thrilled with Amazon as they never let me down. The product is excellent, and the service terrific!"
3,great for dancin' and romancin',"About 42 minutes of classic Soul R&B. Nice version of Love Power - props to Luther (duet with Jeffrey Osborne and solo with Kenny G). Other singers doing duets with Dionne are Smokey Robinson, Howard Hewett, Kashif, June Pointer of the Pointer Sisters. See song list and other review in 1988 CD listing. This CD would do fine in a mix for dancin' and romancin'."
4,An easy to read book with lots of practical tips!,"This book is easy to follow with a lot of readily applicable advices on how to increase your personal charm and magnetism. Each chapter has a self-diagnosis section as well a summary at the end of each chapter for quick reference use. Overall, this book helps you become aware of all those subtle methods a charismatic person employs. It is a must read for those who wants to 'instantly' improve on their own charisma."
4,Overcoming my fear,"I have this problem, I have stage fright. I want to become a professional singer/actress, but i was always to scared to do anything about it. I recently bought this book from a local bookstore and it's been really helpful. I'm finding the courage to preform and do it at my best. If you have stage fright or even just need to find more charisma, this book can help."
2,A Good Remedy For Insomnia,"I bought this book a few years ago and despite the fact that I am an avid reader was unable to move past the first couple of chapters. ""Personal Magnetism"" is so incredibly boring that would successfully cure the most stubborn case of insomnia.I wish I could meet the author to confirm my suspicion that a magnetic person could not have possibly written that."
5,Great Show!,"I watch Nurse Jackie on Showtime, if amazon cuts out the curse words, that would totally annoy me! Anyways, I loved her in the Sopranos, and now she is doing an amazing job as Nurse Jackie, Edie Falco is the best!"
4,Great Beginning,"""Nurse Jackie"" starring Edie Falco is off to a fantastic start. The first episode gives me great expectations of this show. Many times the first few episodes of a show are awkward as the cast tries to gel with each other. And, while some of the male actors seemed a bit too affected such as, Peter Facinelli as Dr. Fitch Cooper, I trust that the proximity of the accomplished cast around him will allow him to rise to the occasion or wash out of there. There are other actors on the show that I loved in ""The West Wing"" including Anna Deavere Smith. Very excited about Steve Buscemi directing the first 3 episodes. Another Showtime Hit!"
3,Nurse Jackie,"Funny. Scary if you have to do some hospital time. Edie Falco does an excellent job and has the personal presence tobe a believable ""nurse"". Not a show for kids or teens."
2,Grows Old Too Quickly,"Because of all the hype and praise, I decided to take a peek at Season 1, but stopped watching after the first six episodes. While the acting, empathy and photography are exemplary, the storyline itself is comprised of an unfortunate mix of farce, silliness and reality which actually detracts from one's viewing enjoyment. Had this production maintained a more serious tone throughout, I believe it would have drawn more favorable attention and pleased a greater number of viewers."
5,awesome!!!,"Love Edie Falco. The depiction of a working mother who self-medicates to continue to work is a great platform for this new drama. If this is a theme that has been done before, Edie Falco will take it to the next level. There are plenty of health professionals in Narcotics Anonymous. Let's be realistic. Nurse Jackie gets the job done...bottom-line. Addiction of any kind, when out of hand, takes us to a dark place. Some of us don't come out of it alive. She's got it all under control now, but just wait. It makes for great, realistic drama.Great supporting cast too! Love her best friend the woman doctor. She is hilarious."
3,doesn't look hi def,"Watched the first 2 episodes last night and the 1st episode looks terrible on this Blu-ray transfer. Picture is grainy at times and then clears up and then goes grainy again. Episode 2 looked better but I just don't believe the transfer is HD and I think this was done on purpose so that the unsuspecting, untrustworthy public would not have a reference copy of the content."
3,TV Drama,"Repetitive theme to this drama of Jackie in pain and taking pain pills. The drama is ok, hoping for more next season."
2,Put Your Brain on Hold...,"I saw a preview of this show last year and as I dont have Showtime, was excited to order this on DVD. I had enjoyed the premiere and thought it seemed like something I would like. After 26 years in healthcare, 12 in a county trauma center, I can tell you there are more Jackies than not. Truthfully I have not watched more than three episodes before I became bored and have not bothered to watch any more of the series. The primary characters are fairly interesting, though the husband character is barely believable as her husband. He looks younger than her and they have no chemistry. The secondary characters are boring and never transcend the stereotypes they represent. But probably the most egregious error is the terrible medicine they practice at this hospital. I can barely sit without pulling my hair out, at the stupidness I see on the screen. A medical advisor would be inexpensive in Hollywood world and could have injected some much needed interest. BORING!"
3,Nurse Jackie: Season One,"With the Medical TV series on offer, a different approach as a tough market to break into."
1,Not a single likeable character in the whole show,"This show is painful to watch. Not in that it is poorly written or acted, but just in the fact that I began to hate every single charater in this show. Most of the main charaters should be in jail. Their behaviour is both despicable and criminal in just about every episode. Edie Falco looks like a man and they try to play her up as sexy. You just feel terrible after evry episode, why keep watching?"
3,Edited,I liked this show. I was disappointed that all the 4 letter words were bleeped out of the version on Amazon. There are quite a few and they are part of the plot. I don't know why they were edited out. Is it because the pilot is free ?
4,Nurse Jackie: Season One,"I really enjoy this show. Zoe (the nursing student) is especially hilarious for me because I am currently a nursing student completing clinicals. I also love ""good guy"" characters whose moral compasses are ...off. Definitely recommended."
3,Not very relaxing,Depressing view of life.I might give it one more try but I don't think so. Might be better with British accents.
1,Season 1 no longer plays on DVD Players,I have watched Season 1 maybe ten times and neither disc will play on any DVD player. Disappointed at shoddy quality.
5,love this show,"When I first so commercials for this show, I just thought it was another show like House. I love House, but I didn't want to watch another show that was like it. however, nurse Jackie is completely different. Jackie is actually sociable and is an excellent nurse. She just happens to be hooked on drugs. I love that the shoe focuses so much on the characters and their lives. Excellent show."
4,A Great Show Even Though I Shouldn't Like It,"I gave this review the title I did because I'm pretty sure that if I read about the exploits of Nurse Jackie in a written report (lying, infidelity, drug addiction, unprofessional behavior that includes criminal action), I wouldn't like Nurse Jackie very much.But I haven't come to know Nurse Jackie that way. Instead, I've gotten to know her and her friends and sparring partners through this very nicely done series. I think Edie Falco is worth her weight in gold in making a complex, deeply flawed character come to life in a way that even knowing all her ""issues,"" you still see the title character as a good person."
5,awesome show,I was hooked immediately and have watched this season twice already! I would even more but I lent the dvd's to a friend.
5,Go Jackie,"I purchased this as a gift for my dad because he was such a Sopranos fan. Reading the premise about the show I didn't think it sounded good. Boy was I wrong. This show is so funny the cast is great and it keeps you laughing the whole way through. Dr. Cooper who keeps grabbing women's breasts, Zoey who trys to act all cool and Jackies two girls are nuts. I was sad when the season ended and couldn't wait for the next. The only thing I don't like is the recap on every episode. I highly recommed this show to anyone who likes dark comedies."
2,Horrible!!!,"Ok, I am a nurse and take offense to this garbage of a show. A drug addict, workaholic, out to make good in the world, having sex on the job is F'in' crap. It just isn't believable or not pleasant to watch. I really don't need to watch tv because real life is a heck of a lot better but hey I only work 36 hours a week and not allowed to work over 40 hours a week. There is sooo much cut backs with the economy I am lucky to be working. Anyway.......it sucks....really....really.....bad!!!!! Nurses deserve more respect!!"
1,What garbage we have to watch now-a-days!,"Really?! A drug using nurse who needs to get high before going to work as a nurse? I unfortunitly know a few drug users and NONE of them coudl keep a job at McDonalds let alone a profestional job. I tried to watch a couple fo the shows but I was throughing away good money. I have been very disapointed about all the garbage shows on TV, and this one really is at the bottom. At least it has the correct rating of TV-MA, but really kids are smart and they will watch this. Do you really want your kids to watch this trash? I don't!"
1,Unhealthy for the Conscience,"Interested in healthy eating? Well, Sabra products are unhealthy for the conscience. After learning how the corporate owner of Sabra (namely, the Strauss Group) has supported the rogue Israeli army unit called the Golani Brigade -- which has an established reputation for brutality against Palestinians -- I decided that this product makes me sick."
3,Is this cat raising the wrong paw?,All the other cats in the book are raising their right paw. Does it matter?
3,Wrong Tail!,"The three star rating is for the book. It is a very good retelling of the Maneki-Neko legends, and gives an accurate history of the cat figurines.However, as the book points out the Maneki-Neko is a Japanese Bobtail cat. The figurine included has a full length tail. As a proud owner of a pure bred Japanese Bobtail, I know that there are unique qualities about this cat that other cats do not possess.Therefore I will have to seek out a real Maneki-Neko figurine to place on the stand, and discard the faux cat that came with this book.I would not advise anyone who wanted good fortune to order this item, as it is unlikely the Kannon Bosatsu would incarnate in an inaccurate representation of her feline aspect."
5,Debra,Love the little kitty I hope he will Give me luck that I have very little of I could use as much as I can get
3,THE LUCKY CAT,"The Lucky Cat has brought us great joy. We have him sitting on top of our curio cabinet in our entryway. He happily waves to all of our guests as they enter or leave our house.Love the cat,Caroline Cosgrove"
4,Too small,Thought this item would be ALOT bigger then what it actually is.. A little disappointed because it's a gift for someone else..
5,Excellent folk-rock from England,"This is the second record from Mojave 3, who rose out of the still smouldering ashes of the great Slowdive. The songs on Out of Tune are melodic and gentle, and Neil Halstead's songwriting just gets better with each release. If you like pop songs with memorable melodies and sweet harmonies, and the crisp sound of a strummed acoustic guitar, then this is the record for you."
4,good music,"I learned about Mojave3 in a movie, in which I heard one of their songs.I looked it up, and bought two of their CD.Great music"
3,my favorite,"a mistake occured! I definitely give this album 5 stars.I love this band, beautiful melodies,voices and harmonies as well as great instruments and arrangments. This is the first one I got and still my favorite, though I gotta admit ""ask me tomorrow"" which I got recently is growing on me (close second). Both albums have no bad songs (I admire that, always). I'm just in love with the deep organ on this one, wish the following albums included it as much of it.Anyways, I've listened to ""out of tune"" to death and still love every song! Some songs on the two following cds I find excellent too, but they each contain 1 or 2 songs I don't care for, so I say get this one for sure, it's impeccable,but don't bypass anything this band does, though, they're great, if you like slow melodic music."
1,a political tract written by an organization,"Werner Erhard founded The Hunger Project, and although his direct personal influence is not felt very much there these days, his ideas and impact still live on through the Exectuvie Director and many of the sennior staff. This volume, created and produced by that staff many years ago, stands as an indication of his/their ideas, many of which (not all) having been eclipsed by ""a shift in the wind"". This will not be a very helpful volume for those seeking answers to the big questions (such as ""Why is there world hunger on a planet that has enough to feed everyone"") but this book will answer less significant questions (such as ""What is the Hunger Project and why do they attract so much contrvoersy""). In that regard it's a helpful book."
3,needs to be updated,"I bought this book a couple years ago, after I had to start using a manual wheelchair. I liked the first chapter that talks about the history of the wheelchair and 2 companies that made it to the top ranks in wheelchair invention and sales (Everest & Jennings and Quickie). Though it is packed with a lot of very good information on how to select accessories for your chair and the difference between power chairs (rear, front, or mid wheel drive), most of the manufacturer information is outdated. In fact, some of the companies the author provides are out of business or have been bought out by other mobility companies.The only part that isn't realy outdated is the section on wheelchair cushions, since most of the cushions the author mentions are still on the market. Other than the book needing a makeover, its still a good basic wheelchair reference guide."
2,not pleased....,"Im a massage therapist, polarity therapist & a buddhist... and I will tell you that this book sounds made up..but then again, you should never judge someone by their beliefs.. so, I personally did not like this book but someone else might find it helpful. Good luck on your quests!!!"
1,"A very silly book, not recommended for the paranoid.","Highly entertaining but possibly for the wrong reasons. This book is fine if you think that the world is highly dangerous and it is necessary to have a specific meditiation for every situation/domestic appliance in life. Not very Christian, not very Buddhist and not very spiritual, but it might do George Bush some good."
5,Great Start!,"Kenny G's debut finds him very much in the shadow of his exleader Jeff Lorber,who produces and plays synthesizers and keyboards on some of these songs.The upbeat ""Shuffle"" is notonly self-explanatory as to it's sound but is exactly the kind of song Kenny and Jeff used to write together back in the Jeff Lorber Fusion daze!He opens the album with an update of Cannonball Adderly's soul-jazz classic ""Mercy,Mercy,Mercy""-an attempt to showcase Kenny G's apparent 'link' to jazz.But uptempo R&B seems to be the order of the day here and fans of this album are encouraged to seek out Jeff Lorber's very similarly styled 'It's A Fact' CD from the same vintage.It's available as an import CD and for fans of this type of music goes well with this!"
3,"Not his best, but great to listen to","Although Kenny G had not perfected his sound yet, some of the songs on this album are fun to listen to (""Tell Me"", ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"", and ""The Shuffle""). He also does a great rendition of The Eagles' ""I Can't Tell You Why."" If you like this, I recommend you check out Kenny G's albums ""G-Force"" and ""Duotones."""
1,Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Ride The Elevator Again,"It is a crying shame that so many people think of this man's music as jazz. There isn't an ounce of emotion in the man's entire catalog. Try Getz, DiMiola, Tyner, Monk, Garner, Mingus, or anyone else instead."
1,For All Of You Michael Bolton Fans!,"For those of you who like Michael Bolton, Yanni, and all of those guys, this one's for you. You deserve it."
4,Good Introduction to Mahayana,"This is a good, all-round introduction to Mahayana Buddhism. There's no talk of Zen, but alot of Buddhist metaphysics are clearly explained. It is typical Suzuki, and contains almost no info on practice. There's alot of near sermon-like dirges, and also some interesting parallels (and criticisms) of christianity."
3,Typos galore,"This is for the kindle edition: basically it looks like someone scanned in the paper version of this book, but never bothered to proof the text. Full of typos to the point of being hard to read. I guess for .99 beggars can't be choosers, but if you are the type of person who is offended by typos, find another version."
2,Handbook or just a collection of essays?,"I was very dissapointed with this book. Essentially it is a collection of essays on various topics with no logical flow or organization. In addition, no time was taken to present the material in any way useful to a student of Systems Engineering. I was required to purchase this book for a graduate class I am taking. Initially I believed that it was a sound investment and that I would retain the book as a valuable reference. Now I can't wait to sell it back. I question whether or not the editors did more than just staple together 30 essays."
5,An excellent resource,"Many times when searching for information to give clients, this book has been benefical to find scriptures to support information that I give my clients who are dealing with problems in thir lives. It has been a great reminder of just how relevant the Bible is in today's culture. The topical helps and notes are a real time saver."
1,"No answers, more questions.","I did not read the description of the book closely enough. I failed to see that it was only 24 pages. I also wasn't aware that it was originally printed in Great Britain. I found this book overly simplistic and also much of the terminology unfamiliar. Building supplies that are commonplace in Great Britain are not necessarily so in the U.S. This book did not answer a single question that I have about housing a horse or pony. The author states that concrete is an optional stable floor and every other book I've read states that concrete is not an acceptable flooring option. When presenting chalk as a well-draining surface over a clay shed floor the author fails to state how much chalk a person should use, not to mention I have no idea if chalk is available here. Is it the same as lime? I have no idea. For me, this book presented more questions and no answers."
2,"clippers ok, file horrable",The clippers work pretty good but it comes in a kit with the a file. I thought this was a great idea but you try to use the file once and it falls apart and doesn't even work. I wouldn't spend the money on this.
3,"Cheap, but does the trick","Quality is low, but overall it was ok i guess i use that term loosely as you get what you pay for here folks."
5,"Tried Em', Love Em'","I've been playing rock guitar for a while now. I've triend just about every other string there is. These are definitely my favorite. It's not like they are leaps and bounds above the competition but in my opinion they are the best. They have a long life, great bending ability, and good price.5 stars"
5,Ernie Ball Strings A+,"What more can I say. Been using Ernie Ball strings since 1979. IMO, they are the best strings on the market. Sure you can pay more for strings like Blue Steels, but they still don't sound like these. These are priced just right, and deliver every time!"
4,Good Movie,"In Too Deep is a urban drama that was overlooked in 1999. Omar Epps is good in the lead role a J. Reid/Jeffery Cole an undercover cop who begins to lose his mind while trying to get close to God ( a drug lord) played very effectively by LL Cool in one of his best performances ever. The direction and cinematography are very good and the film features cameos from rappers Nas, Stickay Fingaz and Jeramine Dupri. While the film isn't as good as Deep Cover it's still worth a look."
4,In Too Deep,"The is a mix between Donnie Braso and Deep Cover with a ghetto-fabulous twist to it. This movie is great. LL Cool J, did a fantastic job as the bad guy. Even though he is a rapper, his performance was equal to Omar Epps. This is a must see."
4,Decent,"It's a decent movie. No acadamys will be won, but it's entertaining. This thing is making me put more words."
5,in to deep,"loved it. I didnt remember the movie it self but enjoyed it.The movie came new and still in cover.very happy, no problems at all with play"
4,The Real,"From the time the movie started until the time the movie ended, I was glued to the t.v. Omar Epps and L.L. cool J played their parts so beautifully. The momentum of the movie was fast past. It was filled with excitement and allot of action"
3,Good Movie,In Too Deep is a movie about a police officer who goes under cover to bust a Drug Lord. What you get in this movie are 2 strong performances by Omar Epps and LL Cool J (who is quickly showing that his greater talent lies in acting). I would recommend renting this before a purchase but this is a good movie.
4,Dark but good.,"LL Cool J calls himself god in this movie, and is like the godfather of queensbridge. Its a burden for god cop jamal played by omar epps to catch one of the most recognizable villans of the 90s. Not only was ll one of the most biggest star of the 90s, but his charecter was taken into prespective by critics worldwide. Good movie for action thriller lovers"
4,Edge of your seat suspense - ghetto style,"This movie was really good.. I would say most 18-30 year olds (regardless of race) are going to really enjoy this movie... Older white folk might not like the rap music and street life aspects of the movie... If you like that stuff, great, you'll love the movie.. If you don't like that stuff, try to see past it, this movie is full of suspense, I was thinking Epps could get killed any second.. Also, the movie sheds some light on how the drug scene is ran in the city.. You sympathize with the bad guys for a while... Epps and LL Cool J did a great job acting.. and the pool table scene will definitley get a reaction.."
2,should've been a tv episode instead,"Oh please! This is one of the worst movies I've seen. *In Too Deep* is no different then an episode of *Homicide*. Shave off 30 minutes and viola, you got an episode.However, it was still watchable. J. Reid (Epps) is a rookie cop who goes undercover. His goal is to bring down God (LL Cool J) and his ""angels"". By doing this, he performs the biggest drug bust ever.However, what ruined the whole thing was that J. Reid was repeatedly asked if he was a cop. J. Reid never once answered this question. God and his gang just let him join. Oh please!I know! I know! Suspension of disbelief. But still! It wasn't working for me."
4,good for a test strip,"I use them as a quick check, and if anything is out of spec I will run a liquid test kit to see what corrections to do"
3,Work ok,Have been using the strips for month or two and they work ok for a quick reading. I have compared the results with another brand test strip and the API master test kit. The only one that is really off for me is the nitrate which keeps coming up bright pink or 200 and the real level is 20. Not sure why it keeps doing this except maybe since my tank water is so hard? Not sure. I have tried the strips in other samples of water including spring water and distilled water. And it seems to work fine with those samples. I think for most causal fish keepers the strips should work fine but remember the strips are not as good as the liquid tests. I probably will not be buying these again since I always have to double check the nitrate level to be sure it's not really off the charts.
5,Great,I use these for my salt water tank and they do a quick and great job in testing for the essentials. Better then the messy liquid tests.
1,Not what advertised,This is not 6-in-1 test. They actually send you Amonia test strips. Make sure you get what you are paying for...
4,Easy To Use and Economical,Good for a quick check of water parameters. Not pin point accurate but enough to tell you if the water's off.Color charts are a little inconvenient.Would have been better if the charts could be print on the outside of the container.
4,test,best iv found works fast and 95% acc to chemical test exp saltwater alkalinity test could be way off depending on the salt u use
5,An incomparably moving film full of stunning images,"This film goes way beyond documentary into the realm of art. As Herzog once said about a mountain, and as someone said about Herzog's work, it is ""difficult ... dangerous ... ecstatic."" It begins as a more or less conventional documentary about airships and one man's attempt to design a smaller and more maneuverable ship, but as it goes, it turns into a meditation on what this ship, the ""White Diamond,"" means to the people who encounter it, from the engineer who seeks redemption for his colleague's death, to the village children who cannot ""see"" it, to the local man who wants to fly to Europe to find his family and cease being ""a lost brother, a lost son."" The airship is counterpointed with dazzling photography of the million swifts that fly in and out of a ""Secret Kingdom"" behind a waterfall, a flight that even the White Diamond cannot make. Other themes weave in and out -- levity, danger, and human emotion. The music is stunning. A superb movie."
3,Points For Effort,"Only Herzog could capture our imagination with such limited footage. Any other filmmaker would have completely scrapped this project after the first flight over Guyana malfunctions so quickly and badly that subsequent flights can only be attempted over clearings on a tether. I love how Herzog bullies and cons his way into getting on the test flight and the assistant scientist's ultimate tantrum about this shocking breach of protocol. There's also an interesting backstory of a trusted laborer who left a huge family back in Spain. 5 stars for effort, 1 for the actual balloon footage, so I split the difference."
2,"good for a travelogue, not so for a film","Interesting subjects, poorly shot, searching for a cohesive story but its pretty thin. It looks like a low-budget PBS documentary, but with more abstract storytelling. It feels very honest which s nice, but honest like a student doc that doest know what its doing, just looking for something interesting. Asks a lot of the viewer to find meaning on the long quiet shots of simple things. Its self-conscious filmmaking that includes the making of the film as part of the film. Again, it honest, but there are some really contrived scenes in there as well, obvious setups that seem even more out of place in this type of filmmaking."
3,WHITE DIAMOND,I had not heard about this film prior to seeing it on Amazon. It is very much a Herzog film in style but the usual Herzog imprimatur of borderline outrageousness is not there. This is a documetary not really an adventure.
5,Outstanding book,"The Year of the Dog: Tales from the Chinese Zodiac is a great book! Oliver Chin's tale of a brave little dog looking for a chance to prove himself is clever and inspiring. My kids, aged 7, 9 and 11 all enjoy the book and read it all the time. Miah Alcorn's illustrations are colorful, lively and full of expression. Yet another great book in the Chinese Zodiac series. I just ordered Year of the Pig and the new Year of the Rat. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Disappointment,"This clock looked ideal for an older family member. However, it was a bit top heavy and they couldn't get used to the buttons."
3,Not bad for the price.,Looks cheap. I couldn't find figure out to set up time. A nice member from Amazon took the time to post the instructions. The instructions from the box was hard to read. The font was so small.
2,Talking clock,We have a blind niece living with us and ordered the clock for her.It is so difficult to set that my husband has to do it for her.Also it announces the hour 24 hours a day and we can't seem itturn it off.
2,Caution!!! Wrong version,"This is NOT the 2004 Basic Game product that is pictured. The game arrived yesterday and turned out to be the 2006 Basic Game with 12, not 16 miniatures including a large blue dragon, not the smaller black dragon of the earlier set. The 2006 game can be purchased for under $17 from Amazon, making this doubly annoying."
2,short video,"Short...I thought it would be more educational. It seemed like it was promoting a certain treatment or company. If you can cure autism, why isn't this approach being used for all kids?"
4,Makes you want to dance,The day that this song aired on tv with the video it stuck to my head. I have looked for it since and asked my friends to look for it but they have not found it either. Until today where I searched under their name and found it finally!!!
2,Gipsy Kings Not!,"Some say that the sound is reminiscent of the Gipsy Kings. I disagree. While Boom Boom Boom is infectious and cute, the sound is sophomoric compared to the elegance and complexity of the Gipsy Kings."
4,KINGTINUED,"This Album represents a true likeness of Elvis Presley, Doug Church copies Elvis in a true way that Elvis can only sound- I recommend this album and his Volume one as well doing songs that Elvis may have recorded had he been alive.Well worth the purchase."
3,Sounds like Pokemon!,"We expected more variety of songs for 10 years of Pokemon. How many times can you rewrite the theme song melody? In any case, it's all about Pokemon and that's what my son likes."
4,Good soundtrack but not 100% satisfying.,The songs are good and fun to listen to. They are the best of the best from all the songs that have come out over the past ten years. The only problem is that some of the songs are really short.Track 3----1:00Track 9----0:47Track 10---0:47Track 11---0:47Track 12---0:48Track 13---1:01Track 14---1:03
1,Without a doubt the worst appliance I've ever bought,"Before getting a combo washer/dryer, I did a bit of research, and found that Haier models were a gamble. I bought the Summit as it seemed a decent enough unit. If I'd looked further, I would have known that the Summit is a repackaged Haier, and very poor quality.Our first one had a failed heating unit after several months, which was replaced under warranty. Then the condenser failed, creating hot, very wet clothes after a drying cycle. Replaced. Then the heater failed again. We requested a complete replacement appliance. The replacement worked for about 4 months, then the condenser failed; we're through with it, a complete waste of money."
1,Worst machine ever,"Oh man, is this a whopperI moved into an apartment building that came equipped with a washer and dryer. After we moved in, the management installed the summit 'professional' which immediately flooded 3 inches of water into our brand new unit. 2 mop buckets of sudsy water later, they finally they got it working. By working I mean they actually had to replace the entire unit. The building hallway is now littered with dozens of the rusting corpses of these horrible machines.Clothes take forever to clean and when the dryer cycle kicks on, a horrible burning rubber smell fills the apartment. Maybe the rubber gasket is out gassing... After you open a few windows to air out your apartment, you are rewarded with the most wrinkled clothes I have ever seen. I mean you would really have to try to make clothes this crimped. Please do not waste your money on this hunk of crap. Unless you are a masochist, then by all means go for it."
2,SPWD1470C,"I use a Summit Professional Washer Dryer, model 1470C. The washer function works great. The dryer stopped working after about a year and it took the technicians from the retailer several trips to figure out how to fix it. The dryer also takes a long time to dry and only has one heat setting. When clothes come out, they don't have static which is nice. It is nice because it saves space, but it does not save time. Since there's only one machine, you can't wash clothes and dry clothes simultaneously since you have only one machine. Overall, I would not recommend it because of the issues with the dryer functions."
4,Ronnie's Take on the 80's Music Trend.,"I have to agree on Andrea's imput on this album. Here Ronnie leaps in to the 80's music style. I loved Ronnie Laws vocals. It seems that after this album release, he swayed away from singing on his album releases. I know he's considered a Sax Player, but if you have listen to his eariler releases, the guy can sing too.......Come on Ronnie, give use a new release with your Sax playing & Vocals also........Please.....I miss them both.......(~=A Devoted Ronnie Laws Fan FOREVER..........J.T. Norman."
5,Fun and Informative,"This book is a must-have for those of us who love the lure of the road and all it has to offer. It's sad that a lot of these wonderful icons of Americana are vanishing, but it's great that people like Jim Heimann are preserving it for future generations to see. I highly recommend this book -- lots of great photos and interesting history in a nicely organized book!"
4,California Crazy and Beyond,I remembered that I was kid to saw the dog building site at the front cover. It was location Washington Blvd and now it was gone. I really loved to see the historical sites!
5,A Must Read!,"Every American should read this book. It reminds you why our country is so great and reminds you of all the big and little things you can to do help make it even greater. It made me feel good about myself and my country, and gave me a few pointers on how to improve myself, my community and the great old USA."
2,Grossly overrated,"This release preens personality over songwriting content, making it sound more feminist victory than triumphant recording, with pretentious ramblings over slightly edgy songwriting simplicities creating the embraced illusion of something far less authentically gritty than posited."
1,"Commerical, generic garbage for aging hippies.","Who still listens to this junk? First, she isn't even hot. Who listens to ugly female singers? Listen to true beauties like Jessica Simpson. Hot = talent. Second, this album is like 1000 years old. It never even got any BET airplay! An artist is only good if they're on BET. Third, this is commerical, generic garbage! It was overproduced, too commercial and Patti's voice was generated through a computer. What you're hearing is basically a machine making this pathetic excuse for ""music"". She even tried making a rap song (""Redondo Beach""). Wow, Patti, give it up. You'll never be as good as 50 Cent. Sorry."
5,Masterpiece,"Patti Smith / Horses (bonus track): ""Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine"", with those attention-grabbing words Patti Smith introduces herself and her band as the tortured poetic souls of the Punk era. Beat poet meats Garage Band in the 1970's. The Patti Smith Group sounded more profound than they really were, but the sound was great, and the words were evocative. This is a Masterpiece. Five Stars."
5,Not riding still?,"the best rock album ever? Probably, yes, but in any case, a revealing experience. A creative peak poetical and musically speaking. Undoubtedly, a ""must""."
2,A real disappointment,"I listened to ""Horse"" a couple of times after having heard music by Ms. Smith that I found dynamic and emotionally moving. I had also heard rave critiques and was very interested in hearing what many consider to be her best work. The words that come to mind are self absorbed and pretentious, and in large part musically lame. Enjoy it if you enjoy it: perhaps you had to be there at the time of its inception to truly appreciate it. As far as I am concerned this piece falls far short of its mark, and the praise that has been heaped upon it."
4,Patti Smith - 'Horses' (Arista),"Originally released in 1975, as this was the proto-punk princess's first solo effort. I haven't heard this title in ages. Nice to hear on CD reissue. Tunes I remember playing (when I was in the mood) numerous times enough to wear the vinyl copy out were her cover of Van Morrison's ""Gloria"", the nine-minute ""Birdland"", the inspiring ""Kimberly"", the lp's other nine-minute epic ""Land: Horses / Land Of A Thousand Dances"" + this disc's added bonus cut, her almost-mutated cover of the Who's ""My Generation"". Glad to know Patti Smith is still active today. Recommended."
3,Just My Opinion,"I had to read this book for school. Personally, I thought that it was pretty good, but it is kind of hard to start. Also, I noticed quite a few generalizations about Chinese people in the book. I myself would recommend this for people who are 12 years old or above, because younger children may get tired of it."
4,My 10-year old Daughter's Review of Young Fu,"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze was written by Elizabeth F. Lewis and set in Chungking, China. It is told in the first person and teaches about China in the early 1900's. Young Fu is a good book about a[...] boy (Young Fu) who moves to the city with his mother and becomes an apprentice to Tang the Coppersmith. He has many adventures and becomes a favorite in the shop. I thought it was strange that good luck seemed to follow him everywhere. I enjoyed the sarcastic and humorous remarks throughout the book. There are no very sad parts and I think altogether it is a nice book."
5,"It was a good book, but it has some hard words.","It was a good book. It may be for older children, becauseit has a lot of hard old Chinese words. I recomend this book for 6&7 grades"
1,Not a good book,"On avrage, I read fast. I read a copy of the edition that was 264 pages. Normanly that would take me 2 days. This boring book took me about a week. From the begining, this book was dull and hard to understand. I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who doesn't history fiction. It had some crude parts, as well."
2,"Some good points, but other than that......","not much of annything happend. People who like historical fiction will probably love it. It is historicaly and culturlly correct. I personally did not injoy it. Nor do I think fans of Tolkien, Brian Jacques, Lloyd Alexander, Richard Adams, etc. will either. It just depends on taste. When I read I like to escape from the real world. To sum it up, BOARING, DULL, WITH SMALL UNINTERESTING CHARICTORS, and I would NOT recomend reading it unless you have to."
1,This book is boring,now mabye this is not fair because i do not usually like realistic books but this book was boring. I hade to read this book for school and I was bored. It's about a young boy named Fu growing up and having a hard life in China. I would not recomend this book unless really like realistic books and ones that are slow. Did I mention the chapters were long.
5,excellent art resources,"I orginally found this book at the library and had to have it. I am not a beginner artist but it would be excellent for any beginner. It dicusses design, materials, and concepts. It would be great for teachers as the projects can be easy or advanced depending on the instructor. For the more experianced artist it offers inspiration and nuggets of information. Full color pictures too!"
4,Very Creative Collages,"I've always admired collages and remember when it was routine to make them in grade school. As an adult, I love crafts but have not ventured into the collage arena.I agree the instructions and projects were generally easy to follow, but looking at some of the pictures made you think, ""there is no way I can do that""! Because of this book though, I am encouraged that I can start small and work up. The book shows beautiful collages that I have not seen in other books. It looks as if it would be helpful to the beginner, even if it is a little intimidating, looking at the gorgeous collages. I have already started saving magazines and other materials.A couple of my favorites and the least intimidating (to me) were the Found Papers Collage and Working With Printed Words collage (pg 18-19). The rooster on page 35 clearly demonstrates the process and combines basic collage process. My goal is to work up to something like the awesome portrait collage on page 29.Recommended."
1,GRAVITY Experiment For Jazz Lovers,The best gravity experiment for all music lovers is to drop this CD off of a tall building. Make sure that you don't hit any birds on the way down.
3,"""Gravity"" Kenny G","I like Kenny G to do the blues type, sad type sentimental songs. NO words and not to jazzy. I wish he would do an album called: ""Kenny G Does Billy Vaughn"". That would be good"
1,Buyer Beware,"Although this book has beautiful pictures and interesting recipes, you should be aware that it is the exact same book as ""Handmade Soap, a practical guide to making natural soaps,"" but for the title and photos on the cover, together with its omissions -- the author fails to state what ""mixed herbs"" are in the recipe, and also fails to state how long soap must be cured before making the hand milled recipes. Several emails to the publisher have failed to elicit a response."
3,Bored?,This game has a pretty cool story. Your a paratrooper flying in. You have lots of weapons and the graphics are decent. But the AI is terrible. The Nazis dont shoot back often and their detail is low. Its also a very short game. Perfect game for a rainy day or slow computer.
2,Not Pleased,While this game is fun to play it is too short and too simple for an experienced RPG player. When compared to a game such as Medal of Honor it's too short the missions aren't as detailed as expected which leads to a quick completion of the game.
1,Futuristic Ripoff,"Garbage! A bad retake of ""Blade Runner""! No originality, storylinee or plot, just an poor attemp to capitalize on a classic by renameing it under the title of a nother classic!"
2,Warning! This is a pilot!,"I am sorry to say that I just wasted 2 hours of my life on this. I really enjoyed it, but all of sudden it just ended! No real ending, no resolution. Nothing. Then I come on here and figure out that this is just a pilot episode to a series. Now I have to figure out if I have access on cable to see the rest of this. I guess I should have been more careful about what I was getting myself into. Overall a good concept, but I would like to how it ends!"
1,This movie is BAD!,"What can I say ... the acting is poor, the sound is weak, the video is only fair, the plot and action scenes are bad ... I rented this movie because I'm a huge fan of the original Total Recall. This movie should not be allowed to even carry the Total Recall name; it is without a doubt the worst Sci-fi movie I've watched in a long, long time.Don't waste your hard-earned $.p.s.I was forced to put at least one star on this movie; but it's really a zero."
2,Should be recalled,"I mean, as in 'factory recall.' See that quote on the casing, ""Total action?"" That comes from the Canadian edition of TV Guide. If any more impressive source could have been cited, I assume the makers would have used that quote instead.This could be a made-for-TV effort. Instead of acting, this relies on stereotypes, like sneering bad-guy, maverick cop, and don't-make-waves boss of the maverick. Then there's that cop's partner, the one with a secret that you'll pretty much guess in the first few seconds of his appearance. In fact, when it came time to out that guy in a big dramatic scene, I had long since forgotten that his secret was secret at all.The big bad corporation theme still works, especially after the recent implosion of the financial corporations. That's about it, though. Maybe this was watchable after a few beers, when nothing else was on, but its sell-by date came and the day it was aired. Just don't bother.-- wiredweird"
5,Way underrated,"This ""movie"" is the first two episodes of an awesome TV series. It is a captivating blend of 80% Blade Runner, 15% Total Recall, and 5% Data from Star Trek. The plot is dark and intriguing. Character development is excellent. Cyberpunk 2020 role-playing fans should love this. I just hope that episodes 3-22 come out on DVD - the sooner, the better."
4,The Bladerunner TV series,"If you're expecting Total Recall 2070 to be a continuation of the Arnie film from 1990, then you'd be wrong, however, you won't be disappointed, it's BETTER!It's really the Bladerunner TV series. The same issues with androids, the same tops of buildings with large extractor fans turning slowly with steam bellowing from the ground.What stops it from becoming the usual TV series based on a film is a compelling plot and the boldness to have nudity, violence and strong language.Picture and sound quality are good although nothing special. The computer graphics of the city sometimes look a bit dodgy.Really worth getting!"
3,Great start for a series!,"I agree with the guy from Seattle; they should have made it clearer that this was a series pilot! It was great, visually attractive and the plot and characterization was excellent. It just left too many loose ends to make it on its own as a film, though I would *love* to see the rest of the series! It's kind of like watching _Fellowship of the Ring_ and not knowing that there are more movies coming!"
3,Stick with it . . .,"Whilst I am a huge fan of Michael Easton to be honest the opening episodes of htis show aren't the greatest. The plot is confusing, the gritty backdrop is undermined by total lack of explanation or history, and the writing at times downright shoddy. Nevertheless the actors do well with what they're given and it does rate well on the originality stakes. It's worth sticking with this show for it does improve vastly, promising to be one of the better arc series of the past few years - that is, before it was cancelled."
2,Better choose the originals....,"It's not a bad movie - just the originals are better; the heroes never reach Schwarzeneggers action scills in ""Total Recall"" nor his action flair, the city never looks as dark as in ""Blade Runner""; even though special effects should have improved it lacks compared to the oldies. You can make a better investment ..."
2,It starts off good but then it gets really cheesy,"This starts out pretty well but then it gets really lame in the middle. The writing and special effects just get really lame and you don't care about the plot at the end.I bought this because I like Michael Easton. I am glad to see that he went on to better movies and shows because this ""Total Recall"" makes you want to have a ""Total Refund"" of your money."
1,Waste of time.,"Don't see it, even if you can see it for free it's not worth your valuable time. It's a total insult for the original Total Recall it's pure used material. Really 0 stars."
4,Cheaper than Guitar Center,"I saw this strap at Guitar Center (Home of the Expandable Profit Margin) and they wanted some ridiculous price for it. I looked it up on my iPad and showed them the Amazon price. They said they could not beat the price, right after saying they would beat any price, even Amazon's. So I ordered it right then and there, standing in Guitar Center, thanked them, and walked out. I had it two days later, with free shipping thanks to Amazon Prime--which I totally recommend if you do a decent amount of shopping with Amazon. It pays for itself in no time.Great looking strap, great price, and I didn't have to haggle with a girl with a barbell through her lip."
5,"High Quality, Professional Grade Strap","This strap has a versatile design, and it is extremely comfortable and soft to wear. The fabric is supple and the strap about 1/8-in. thick, providing some padding to make it hang confortably around your neck and shoulder. The width (2-in.) is just the right size to get on/off easily and not dig into your shoulder while playing. The design is embroidered with a high-quality silk or rayon thread to give it nice color and an expensive look. The tabs are leather and easy to attach to your guitar. Love the subtle snake design, quality workmanship and can't beat the price value -- it's a steal. Highly recommend."
1,Not the original strap!,"I just got this today in the mail and I've notice that it does not have the planet waves' logo and the ""JS"" is painted and not stamp! I know the the difference because I own a couple and I must admit they look cooler with other js logo. This just looks cheap. I'm returning it and I was told by the customer service that these are the new straps they got in July..."
3,"Awesome strap, until it broke.","I will start off by saying I loved this strap. I love the design. Its lightweight, and the material slides easily against clothes or skin. That being said, I am very disappointed that after only 6 months, one of the plastic piece that holds the strap and leather end broke. Im holding out hope that this was just a rare case, and I plan on ordering the same strap as a replacement."
3,A pretty good read,"Entertaining, although the previous book was a much better read. I hope that when the Air and Fire books FINALLY come out, they move a little faster and have more engaging characters.The horrible German translations were appalling! The phrases were simple enough to be easily translated but weren't. Marjorie, you ought to be embarassed. It should never have gotten past the editor, either. I don't speak French, but I hope it was better translated than the German.Sorry to be so harsh, but this book really didn't meet expectations set by its predecessor and the glaring lack of translation casts doubt on the author's effort and dedication to the quality of her work."
4,"Good story, but lost interest before the sequel made it out.","Book two was slower to catch on than book one, But kept my attention once I got into it. Overall, a good read. I was pumped all the way through one and got gearred up again during two. Are there still four elements? Where is book three?? I am about too discouraged to care...it's been so long in comming. Kellogg had a great story going, but it's like having to leave a show at intermission."
4,Good second installment,"As the first volume of the quartet started out vaguely medival, it is a pleasant surprise how the author handles the transition into SF, while keeping the fantasy elements true and credible. Characters grow further and develop, story remains fast paced.Alas, the attention to detail is still lacking. German is a real language that could have contributed to the reader's immersion in the story. Instead it is an increasing annoyance.Lovers of Fantasy will like it, the ideas behind the plot are fairly easy to spot, but it is fun to watch the characters muddle their way through the puzzling events.Still worth reading, perhaps vol 3 or 4 will finally warrant five stars?"
3,Above average fantasy novel,"For a fantasy novel this is definitely a cut above average: it moves forward at a brisk pace, despite multiple story lines. Also better written than the first part of the series, which apparently was meant merely to provide a contrast to this book.However in many ways this is a very pessimistic book. The ""hero"" N'Doch is an all too common and quite recognisable product of the unrestrained breeding programs that Churches implement in Third World countries. In the book he is intimately exposed to enormous and magical goodness but stays ""bad to the bone"". How are we expected to survive with millions of such guys in existence and not a dragon in sight?"
5,An adventure of a life-time.,"'In the Beginning, four mighty dragons raised of elemental energies were put to work creating the World. They were called Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. No one of them had power greater than another, and no one of them is powerful alone. When the work was completed and the World set in motion , the four went to ground, expecting to sleep out this World's particular history and not rise again until World's End.' -from the beginning of The Book of Earth by Marjorie B. KelloggThis is a fantastic series of dragon novels that let's you follow the Dragon's and their Guides adventures one at a time. I can't wait until The Book of Fire and The Book of Air are finished. Hopefully very soon! Enjoy you're reading and have fun! : )"
3,"Great story, but kinda hard to read","I am not exactly an expert on writing, but I have read my fair share of Fiction. I found the book to have a great storyline, that kept me reading well past the time I entended to go to bed, but found the parts told by N'Doch (which were told in present tense) slightly hard to read. I am usually open to all kinds of writing styles, but I found those parts a little disappointing, especially with the parts told by Erde being 3rd person.Unlike many other people who read the book, and found N'Doch's Character disappointing, I didn't. One of the things that I enjoied most about the Dragon Quartet books was that Kellogg keeps it real, like with Rainar in The Book of Earth, N'Doch's character is more of what we actually find in life.Overall I enjoied the book, and cannot wait to read the next in the series."
5,Pelleted Carbon,"I have been in the hobby since as long as I can remember. When The ""Pelleted"" Carbon came out, it made all the difference in water clarity. This is the only Carbon I use. There is NO substitute for this carbon. It lasts twice as long as regular carbon. Also it washes much better then crushed carbon. Once you use this, it'll be tho only carbon you ever use. I am just an advanced hobbyist giving recognition to a product that I think is second to none. Use it for a month and you'll see what I mean."
3,History brought to life.,"Often when we read of an event in history, it is usually very dry reading, stating only the names and dates. However, this book brings a chapter in U.S. history to life. It is in story form, but you do begin to picture what every day life was like in 17th century New England."
2,Don't begin your study of the Salem Witch Trials here.,This is the most poorly edited and proofread book I have ever read. It is full of typographical errors and mistakes in printing. The word processor upon which it was written must not have had a spell checker because it is also full of misspelled words. The content may be valuable but the poor editing is very distracting.
4,Burning the Midnight Oil to Finish this Book.,"Dorcas Good writes her account of the Salem Witch Hysteria as a catharsas for the evil she suffered during the trial. Dorcas was only 4 years old when she, along with her mother, was arrested and accused of witchcraft in Salem, Mass. The little girl sufferered unimaginable abuse by her captors and even people close to her. Through it all she managed to survive the ordeal though she watched her mother taken to the gallows. At first I was a little confused at the style of writing. The writing is that of an adult and not a small child. Once I realized that Dorcas was a young women by the time she managed to put her story on paper, it all fell into place. This is not a pleasant read; for it deals with the subject of child abuse and evil. The ending is a surprise that leaves you contemplating the story of Dorcas Good for days to come."
1,Just plain awful...,"What an incredible waste of time and paper. I wish I could say something good about this book, but that would be dishonest. The characters are wooden, the dialogue ridiculous, the writing simply awful.The story appeals to the sordid, the salacious, and the perverse. Don't bother unless you think it's cool when suicide bombers blow themselves up."
3,"Useful, but misleading.","Product works fine. it is a battery. But the package states ""take more pictures"" and it refers to itself as ""ultra high capacity"" despite the fact that this is a lower capacity than the battery its replacing. The Canon NB-5L is a 1120mAh vs this battery's 800mAh capacity; you'd probably be better off getting one with a higher capacity, though I would pick the Targus brand over one of the non-branded ones from bad experiences I've had with cell phone batteries."
5,Great Item!,"My son took this along with the weather proof paper and journal with him on a NOLS semester and it was fantastic - never let him down - despite the heat, rain and even snow."
5,A surprise listening,"I was on the net listening to a song called ""Waltz In G Minor"" that I enjoyed so much that I found out that it was by Alex Bugnon. I blindly bought this CD without sample listening to any of the tracks on it. And oh how pleased I was. Alex is a great musician. I would not say he's underrated but sure never heard him played on airwaves. It is such a pleasure listening to his music."
2,You get what you paid,"These are my first Telephoto lens, I don't like optical quality of pictures are not sharp, with some cromatical aberration and it's noisy. Good autofocus. I think is better to save more money and get another like 70-300 VR.I like to take pictures of birds and animals, but the pictures are not sharp, maybe to other needs but not mine.It could be that mine are defective.Second Revision:Now I'm using a Monopod I get Better results, My pictures still look a litle blurry at 300mm, I'm taking pictures at 270mm with very nice results ."
1,Nikons Top Worst Lens!,I am very surprised that Nikon produce such a poor quality Chinese made lens. This lens will only damage Nikon's good name for quality optics. The only thing going for it is the low weight. As for optical quality I would like to give it a minus rating due to the awful very poor optics. You don't even get what you pay for! Avoid at all costs!
2,Good lens but not work well on Nikon D60,"On the Nikon D60, this lens has no AF if that is what you are looking for. I returned mine for the Nikon 55-200mm which also has the VR, and I'm looking forward to using as soon as it arrives."
1,Not an AF lense,"The price is good for the lense, but it is NOT an AF lense like the seller says it is. I've got a Nikon D3100 and I was EXTREMELY upset when I realized that it was not Auto Focus. I was looking forward to using it for the 4th of July but that obviously didn't happen. I understand the AF may work with other Nikon cameras, but the seller needs to advertise that the AF will only work with certain cameras. Extremely upset that I wasted my money. I would not recommend this product to customers."
4,Autofocus not compatible with D3200 but great deal and quality delivery,The autofocus is not compatible with the D3200 but still a great deal. It arrived in perfect condition.I wish it had included a protective bag and lens hood. Did not.
4,Nikon Nikkor 70 - 300 mm f/4-5.6G AF Lens,"The only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus, especially where there is not adequate light. Aside from this it is a good but not great lens. It is probably worth the money that it cost, however, I believe that a better lens would be the 70 - 300 MM VR which costs about 4X the price of this lens."
5,GREAT LENS!!!,I have a Nikon D3000 and I am still learning everyday. This is my 3rd Nikon lens. This lens is manual focus for my camera (reach I was needing to get better at). I wanted something that will allow me to take pictures of objects far from me. This lens works perfect for me and it worked in my price range.
4,"An Excellant Buy for Any Camera, AF or NOT!","Though this product does not offer the autofocus option it will for other Nikor enabled cameras such as the D300, D500, D2000, D3000 and D5000 cameras, it is still an excellent buy. Originally even I thought it would allow for Autofocus for the D3000 SLR digital camera I have, but even without that it's still quite useful and just worth the effort. Offers range settings for distance and when coupled with range-finding tools in the D3000 still will give you excellent focusing adjustability in manual mode. Clear as a bell lens means excellent photography at any magnification and distances from 7 feet to 30 feet at close range, and very clear shooting for further distances.This product was purchased from this seller. Seller shipped very quickly, and packaged this product very well. Clear invoicing with product. Product shipped new, in the box. On a scale of 1 to 10 in satisfaction, this gets a 10. Very pleased with service."
4,Worth the money,"This is the cheapest Nikkor zoom lens that will get you to 300mm, so is the build quality. The lens feel little cheaper next to my 18-105VR ED lens.I have shot the Moon with this lens. It came out good with all the fine details of the moon.But the lens is very slow to focus. I used this lens in an air show. It took lot of time to focus the fast moving jets.You would need a tripod if you are zooming all the way and the lighting is not enough. Even on cloudy day light, pictures came out blurry when completely zoomed in. I think this will be the issue with all zoom lens without VR.Auto Focusing is noisy but I can live that.But its definitely worth every single penny if you can't afford its expensive clone VR.You will not be disappointed. Picture quality is very good.By the way, I have Nikon D90. I don't have any issues using this lens.I'm completely satisfied with the lens despite some shortcomings."
3,300mm at an affordable price,"The 70-300 G is definitely one of the least expensive lenses to get you to 300 mm, but there are some tradeoffs with the low price tag. I've found my lens to be pretty soft throughout the zoom range (mine is soft even stopped down) and relatively slow to focus (D70). The lens performs best in well lit environments and is capable of taking high quality pictures, but may require more post processing and effort than faster lenses to achieve these results.I bought the lens mainly to get the zoom range at an affordable price, but plan to replace it in the near future (probably will sell the lens). The build quality isn't the best, but it is still pretty durable. Recommended for beginning photographers or photographers on a budget (like myself), but others may be left wanting more. Still, it is sold at a great price."
4,Great lense for the Price.,"As others have mentioned, the autofocus is a little slow and sometimes won't focus at all in really low light. But you should be manual focusing anyways. Other than that this is a great lense, especially for less than 200 dollars. I've used it for photographing motocross and surfing so far. The 300mm is good for getting close up with the surfers while standing on the beach. The colors are crisp and this lense seems to be a little sharper than the 28-80mm Nikkor that came with my D50."
4,Great zoom lens for the average user,"Premium Nikkor optics in a budget priced lens make this one a winner. Having a polycarbonate body, the lens doesn't feel as solid as the old metal framed ones some of us had gotten used to, but for the price difference, it's fully acceptable. If you're used to lenses with a aperature ring then it might take some time to get used to the lack of one on this lens. The quality optics really show with this lens, with no real noticable distrtion or vignetting. What is noticable is the zoom tends to creep when when the camera is pointed nearly straight up or down. This is unacceptable if you want to use the lens for long exposures as the zoom creep will be noticable on the final image, and that's the only reason I'm knocking this lens' rating down to 4 stars for my review. Overall, this is a fine lens for the average photographer on a budget."
4,"Fine for Manual pics, AF doesn't work in 5100",AF doesn't work on 5100. I may not have read the fine print. Be sure you read exactly what camera bodies work with this lense. Works fine on manual focus. What I foind out was most of the time I was taking pictures at great distances and even with action (grandson's football game) and the autofocus doesn't really work so the manual focus works better. Good value. Shipped quickly.
4,Great Lens Nikon Quality!,"Great lens for the price--can't be beat. Produces nice images, crisp and clear. Again, can't be beat for the price.As one reviewer pointed out, this lens does not have it's own focus ring, and AF (Auto Focus) works with most newer Nikons, but not with some of the older. (For example, does not AF (and hence, does not work) with my D40, but is compatible and works with my D90)To be to-the-point, the negatives on this lens is that it is slow to focus and a bit noisy (sound, not image quality). Other than that, it takes beautiful pictures...and did I mention that for the price, it can't be beat???I definitely recommend it and would buy it again. I love having it in my bag for those longer distanced shots."
2,Manual Focus.,If you do not have inbuilt motor in your SLR then don't even think of this one. I am still trying this lens out I am not very please with the quality either. I am still undecided weather I will return this lens or not.
1,Not happy,I didn't realize the difference - it doesn't have the auto zoom capability - wish I had known that. too late to return now
5,300 lens.,Extra clear. I take wildlife photos. Nikon you are #1 with optics. Thanks for making a quality product for us all.
3,Bought me Some Time,"While I really wanted to purchase a VR lens, I couldn't afford it at the time, so I decided to purchase this lens for some neighborhood wildlife shots...Overall performance great, but you must have a tripod to avoid the likely blur to to no Vibration Reduction...I just purchased the VR version today and will be selling this one soon..."
4,Decent lens for the money,"I don't want to say ""you get what you pay for"" but for the money this is the best that you can get. I mean it's not a lousy lens as some would say it to be but a functional at least. Obviously Nikon had to cut some corners hence the plastic mount and non-ED glass. Also it doesn't have the silent wave motor meaning you have to focus manually if you are using a D5100/5200 and below model. But on a positive note, it can still take sharp pictures. Though at 200mm-300mm, there may CA issues. But then again what do you expect at this price level? As long as you know the limitations of this lens and you can still get great photos. Just see the user posted pictures. In short this lens though not really fantastic is a good starter telephoto lens for the money. There is a reason why this is one of Nikon's oldest lens still in production next to the 50mm f/1.8D. And if you want more, then obviously you'll have to spend more."
3,Buyer Beware,"I neglected to read the reviews so hopefully this will stop someone else from making the same mistake I did. Auto-focus is NOT an option with the D40, D40x, and several other common models, something I think the description neglects to mention.That said, it's still a very good lens."
3,good product,My son is taking photography at school. This was a great addition to his camera of choice. It was well worth the money for the quality it provides.
4,Nikon 70-300mm AF non VR,"It is a very wonderful lens. I wanted to get the 70-300mm VR but after purchasing this one, I will say I am satisfied and will not be getting the other one. I take so many great pictures with it on my Nikon D5000. I would recommend it to everyone shooting outdoors. It is not the best lens for indoor pictures. The zoom works so well."
1,Not recommended,"Okay, it`s cheap. Okay, it has a huge zoom. But it is incredibly, unbelievably slow. Wouldn`t find focus in loooong seconds. Keeps rotating back and forth. Very annoying. Picture quality is waaay below what you would expect from a Nikon lens. Plastic. Very plastic. Wobbly. Awful. Not recommended at all, no matter what you would like to use it for."
4,GOOD LENS,Great price. Bought a mono pod for the camera because I had some camera shake and hope it will relieve the shake.
3,"slow, soft and cheaply made","Tried this lens, but it was soft to the point of being out of focus, felt flimsy (very light plastic), and even in the brightest outdoor setting agonizingly slow to focus on my D90. Often, the AF overfocused and went back to blurry, or refused to focus at all!I expected to like this Nikon lens more than this, and am now looking for a Sigma or Tamron (where I'll get the macro feature as well, and for the same price).One good thing about this lens (if you don't mind a supersoft image) is it is EXTREMELY lightweight, which is very enjoyable."
5,Great lens for the price,"This lens far exceeded my expectations. I was a bit worried reading some less-than stellar comments online, especially about build quality, but decided to take a chance. I wouldn't call this lens pro-quality by any streach of the imagination but for the casual user or moderate use pro-sumer, I would highly recommend this bargain of a lens. It's ideal to get up and close to the action and fairly light to hold; this make it easier to hold and compose longer without your arms getting tired. I use this lens with a F100 and focus is much faster than expected. It has a tendency to ""hunt"" more as you zoom in, but not so much when it is zoomed out. It is D compatible to communicate distance information for matrix metering and flash use, there seems to be some confusion about this online... In short, great lens and a fantastic value. Enjoy."
2,Not fully functional with Digital SLR cameras,"This lens is described in the product description as an auto-focus that will work on digital SLR cameras. While the lens is technically an ""auto-focus lens"" it is misleading. If you have a digital SLR camera youR lens has a switch on the side that allows the camera to focus the lens when you press the photo button. This lens does not do that. On a digital SLR camera it is just a manual focus lens. I called the seller and they wanted to argue that the lens was auto-focus but did agree to allow me to return the lens. So while the lens was new and the size specified, my complaint is that the description misleads you into thinking that this is a fully autofocus lens compatible and fully functional on digital SLR cameras such as my Nikon D40 it is not."
1,"Great Product, Poor service from Amazon","The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product. I placed this order more than 30 days ago. Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R. If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping."
5,GREAT!!!!!,I've been playing with my new lens 70-300 mm Nikon and pictures are great and clear. I'm happy with my purchase.
5,Inexpensive quality lens,this is an inexpensive and quality zoom lens. It is amazing to me that I ordered it and the following day it arrived. This lens does need a fair amount of light but it was bought for outdoors shooting. A good product.
4,best bang for the buck,"Would love to have purchased a similar lens for 5x the price of this lens but not right now.For the price this is hard to beat. I wanted a ""long"" lens to take bird pictures and the occasional distant animal/sunset/silhouette shot that I happen onto now and then.If you use a tripod (or a beanbag over a car window)and keep the settings on f8 or even better at f11, the pictures are remarkably sharp.The auto focus seems to hunt a bit but is better than I expected considering the bargain basement cost for the lens.An interesting note is that it appears the lens is often sold used for at or above the cost of a new lens."
3,Lens works great.. just not with my camera.,"picture quality was great, I wouldn't expect anything less from Nikon, however I sold it almost as soon as I got it because it did not auto focus with my D5000. Seller was awesome though.. he was willing to go against his own return policy for me if I hadn't resold it my self. Would definitely do business with again."
3,Nikon name at Wal Mart Price,"Agree with fascination with this price point for a Nikon lense, and difficulties in marginal light situations. You do have to wonder at the optical quality when a teleconverter costs twice as much! Bought it to use with my D50 at my son's soccor games and for wildlife, and have been very pleased with advantage over 200mm on my other telephoto for this purpose. In daylight, it is plenty fast enough to hand hold, and inconspicuously compact at that. At this price, it is hard to pass up as long as you are clear about what you are getting. Family use--great. Pro--no way. A fine match for the D50."
4,Nikon 70-300 lens great buy,"I bought this lens for my daughter who has a Nikon D3100. I knew the auto focus feature would not work on her model, but I was looking for a cheap way to get the zooming capability. She had very little time to learn about the lens before her daughter's graduation, but she did manage to get a few great shots from about the 10th row in the audience, shots she could not have captured without this lens. She does have to work it manually, and a tripod is very helpful, but not absolutely necessary as some reviews I read indicated. She likes the lens very much, and I liked the price. We are taking it on vacation in the mountains. Just know she'll get some fantastic pictures. I would recommend it for amateur use, especially for those with cameras that will work the auto focus feature."
5,Great lens,"In regards to odrering this lens, I was more than satified with the entire experience! The lens is of great quality and the shipping experience was stress-free! Love this product"
3,"lens not right,still amazon made it right.","ordered the 70-300 af lens. it arrived quickly with no hassle. One problem though my amazon search was for 70-300 auto focus for d-60 nikon upon recieving the lens found that the d-60 was one of the models it does not auto focus with. Still I recieved a credit with plusdig ( the vendor) and was able to order the correct one. So, short delay but all in all recieved a good lens at a good price and original lens was also great but will not auto focus with certain models. Next time I will do a little more research as far as compatability with my certain model. still love amazon and will contiue to shop here."
5,early kenny it's great!,This is one of Kenny G's first albums. I had it on vinyl and wore it out. I am so glad to have it on CD. Play it often. Buy it you will love it!
5,Kenny G,This is the MAN! I really enjoy his cd and I listen to it often! It is good for relaxing and listen to when you are going for along drive.
1,The Future Of Jazz (Gulp)?,"The success of Kenny G may mean that jazz musicians of the future may emulate him. Hopefully, they will see that this is not the way to go. As with all of his other releases, this is a lifeless and boring set."
1,"G, The Future Of Jazz? I Hope NOT.","Unfortunately, the success of this album will guarentee that people will start copying this style. This music is not interesting or entertaining. I do not mean to come off as a stuffy jazz purist but I strongly hope that jazz doesn't take this direction in the future. It could be the death knell for the genre and we may never hear the Coltranes of the future."
1,Endless and meaningless,"I am a hardcore jazz fan and i heard a lot of friendsof mine(non-musicians) saying they liked Kenny G, so ihad to know what it was all about.I find that he plays very relaxing ""music"" with a pop sound(he sometimes sounds like the music of an x-rated movie), but he has no inspiration , no senseof intensity , no drive , a very poor rhythmic sense , and ridiculous harmonic choices .In fact he is just ""filling the blanks"" , and he is totally unable to interest anyone who has played music for more than a month.The challenge with smooth music is that even though you are smooth you need to communicate rather than to repeat endlessly those little cliches that Kenny like so much.If you like him i urge you to try to find a music that really ""says something"" , not necessairly jazz , because music is about communication , not background noise(and I really mean NOISE)."
4,This question is driving me Crazy!,"I love this CD!!! But I don't have the original jacket to tell me who sings ""What Does It Take?"" I think it's Peabo Bryson but I'm not sure. Can anyone tell me? It's driving me crazy!!!Thanks!!!"
3,Good Album but the vocalists gotta go,"I really liked the song ""Songbird"" Cause his smooth sax playing relaxes you, plus it's still a popular song played on the radio. ""Champange"" was also a pretty good song to listen to. When I listen to that song It's kinda like listening to a TV theme song for a night time soap opera. The vocalists though ruin the album. Hello!! I listen to Kenny G to hear him play not to hear people sing. You vocalist's gotta go!!"
4,Great Night Car-Riding Music,"I heard the tune ""Midnight Motions"" on a jazz radio station, and I had to call to find out who was the artist. I bought it immediately. Midnight motions is like night car-riding music. It's cool. It soothes me, as if I were walking through an empty Manhattan on a damp night after the rain, with a cool breeze. Or like cruising your car through the damp streets late at nite,hearing your tires on the wet pavement. Just feeling good and sailing. Midnight motions is soothing to the mind. I'm rather new to Kenny G's music, but after this album, I plan to get to know his music better."
4,Chuckie Breedlove,"It is blatantly obvoius that Armando is not and will never be a true msuic lover, but moreso an Armando lover. Kenny G's music styles transends all defined music genres & age groups simply because it is extremely pleasing to the ear, even for Armando's funeral events. (different).DUOTONES as with all of Kenny G's music is truly an excellent effort.The fact that Armando noticed that G's music even sells well amoung those in the age group of 55 thru 105 should have been the cementing factor, since this is the toughest group of music critics on earth. They've yet to accept Elvis, Rick James or the Beattles as viable entertainers. For the record I am not in the noted age group, & I truly hope that my not being a senior citizen doesn't up end Armando's biased rating methodology."
3,Depends on what you're looking for: You'll love or hate it.,"This is very typical Kenny G all the way through which means serious jazz fans will [disapprove] and MOR instrumental fans will mostly like it.Kenny G's audience do like the seductive, even schmaltzy style of his, the very same style which turns off those looking for innovative and highly skilled improvisations.The argument as to whether this is jazz or not is a never ending one, and I personally wonder who really cares. It's the sound and whether or not you're tuned in to the sound or instead are irritated by it...that's what matters. And the sound is a distinctive one, whether you like it or not. Also, it's rather an unvarying sound, so there's very much of a ""more of the same"" feel to his CDs.So in this particular case, my three star rating is basically cautionary. You might find this a great CD or you might find it to be [unsuitable], and the probability is that you already pretty much know whether or not this is your cup of tea."
2,Emperor still has no clothes,"A friend swore by everything holy that this album of Kenny G's [was not weak]; in fact, he swore that it was rather good.Nope.I've given this two stars, which is one more than I have given any other albums of his that I've heard (as I cannot give the ""Classics in the Key of G"" album 0 stars), because the pieces here are a slight variation from the standard instrumental pop he writes. However, I still find his phrasing and his tone abominable and laughable.I don't understand the Kenny G fans. They argue that it is hypocritical to compare Kenny G to the ""jazz masters"" (against which he falls down somewhat), and claim that he is not trying to be jazz. And yet, when they think of jazz, they think of Kenny G, something he has backed up by attempting to play jazz standards.So I go back to this idea. He plays jazz, just not very well and certainly not inventively. It's just plain weak."
3,The good within,"At first listen, Anyone don't seem like anything special, just another alt rock band, and the first track from this CD made me want to turn it off. At track 2, however, I felt compelled to keep listening, and I continue to think they are a very talented band. The lyrics, don't mind me saying, suck my balls... I completely hate the lyrical composition. The vocalist can carry a melody, and an original one too, but he can't write for beans. That's the only real drawback, and of corse a song here and there that just don't flow at all. Overall, you're looking at a good CD, very nicely organized as well as original, but nothing amazing. Very hippie and very catchy, can't go wrong with that."
5,great sound and picture...,I thought this bluray was awesome. I have watched it several times now and I enjoy it the same everytime!!
2,"""Master of Ceremonies"" has to calm down!","Overall, this blu-ray is okay. It's just hard to sit and watch the main sponsor (which is the only reason I can guess that he's allowed to stay there; he also introduces each song) spaz out for the entirety of the concert. He's given a baton to seem somewhat worthwhile, but the real conductor can be seen in his official chambers. Besides that, this is close to 4 hours (you heard me!) long. Also, most songs played are from obscure Sony PS1 titles that only the guy and the 2 people each in the audience who said, ""Whoo!"" for had ever heard of. The origional LEGEND OF ZELDA theme is there, so I can't discredit it totally; but I can't recommend it either."
4,Disappointed at the lack of Final Fantasy finale,The disc is good overall except Square Enix did not let them put Final Fantasy music at the end (which is actually advertised on the disc label sticker) which really ruined the climax of the concert. I see no hurt if they allow it as this product is not really competing with Square's concerts. People love it would like to get all related items as they are totally different good experiences.
5,Awesome family DVD.,I bought this for my son as he plays piano. I was trying to expand his ability to play music that he knows and loves. Low and behold the whole family sat down to watch the orchestra. That same night my son decided to learn Halo thanks to this movie.....
5,FUN!,"This game was fun for our whole family. From my 8 year old son to my 21 year old daughter, we all loved it!"
4,game,this is a great game; we play on family night and during the holiday gathering along with other games; very fun
2,Lots of better games out there,"I bought this and Say Anything because they both had 4+ stars at the time with good review comments, but I'm disappointed with both. I love playing games like Apples to Apples, Mad Gab, Pictionary, Gestures, etc, these 2 games just didn't hold a candle to either. Everyone was bored within a few minutes. You want to give clues but you don't want them to guess right away so it makes it either too hard or way to easy. There's no middle I thought. I wouldn't waste my money on them."
5,Fun game for youg couples or a group of young adult friends!!,"This game is a blast. We first played it with a friend and had to order our own. It can be as innocent or as naughty as you want it to be. Hilarious!! You can't play this game without laughing and having a great time. It can be a little hard til you get the hang of it. We do 3 Rounds each card, the first one we give really hard clues, the second round we give average clues, and the third round we give easy clues. It's fun no matter what, but the more ""naughty"" your clues, the more you'll laugh! I'd recommend it for young adults, and I DEFINITELY recommend it. You won't regret this purchase."
2,A game that is too easy or too hard,"This game is very difficult to play. Sometimes it's frustrating and if you are drinking, good luck altogether. One of the cards says ""Father's Day"". The clues are either way too easy or completely difficult. Maybe it's my group of friends but A Game of Things or Apples to Apples is a lot more fun!"
5,What's Yours Like,"We played this as a family with 8 of us. It was a blast. We laughed a lot and the ages playing were from 16 to 69. It was fun for all of us. It is easy to play, and we will do it again. Maybe even play this with some friends too. Trying to think up honest clues, works everyone's brain a bit, and yet it isn't too hard for the young or the old. Worth every penny I paid for it. Sabo"
5,Game,This is the most fun game! Bought two and need to purchase 1 for me yet! Very fun! Loads of laughs.
4,"Fun, but not for people who like to ""win"".","If you have a group that enjoys sitting around laughing this can be a great game.If you have a group that plays games to ""win"" this game gets little boring. The problem is, in order to win some people give answers that are way too vague- i.e.(describing your yard for example) ""What's yours like?"" ""Mine's fine."" or ""Mine's nice."" After about five minutes of that nobody's having fun.If the answer's are trying to be funny (""Mine's smaller that my neighbor's"", ""the dog poop's on mine"" etc) the game is a lot of fun."
3,It's kind of like being left out of an inside joke.,"I bought this game thinking it would be really fun with a large group of people. Well we played it for game night, and it was really really funny. Everything sounded like an innuendo. But the person who is trying to guess isn't always in on the joke, and it can get kind of frustrating."
5,AWESOME GAME,"this game will have you pissing in your pants!!me and a bunch of my friends get together for game night and this is always a fav, def worth buying!!"
1,Do not buy this!,"This bed was poorly packaged and arrived so badly damaged that only one piece remained usable. After multiple emails to Acme they offered to pay us $110 for the damage, which wouldn't come close to paying for the repair.I then complained to Amazon. They said we could return it, but WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SHIPPING, which would be well over $175 roundtrip. We should not have to pay $175 for receiving and returning an unusable item!BEWARE IF YOU SHOP FROM AMAZON MARKETPLACE!!!. IT IS NOT GUARANTEED. If the item arrives unusable you might still have to pay large shipping expenses."
2,Don't like the DVD,"If you want the climax to remain a surprise for a first time viewer do not buy this version of the movie. There are many added visual effects like flashes of Brad Pitt during Norton's pre-Tyler life that ruin the revelation for novices. It makes for a less astounding turnaround and draws from the movie's overall effect, though still brilliant."
4,"Love it or hate it, Fight Club packs an effective punch","I saw Fight Club with a group of students in a high school club that screens art films. When the film was discussed afterward, each student either loved the film or hated it. One student called the film a ""great dark comedy,"" which led another student to bark, ""This isn't a comedy at all, it's sick!"" When one student criticized director David Fincher for using too many ""MTV-style visuals,"" another student countered, ""What are you talking about? The visuals are amazing!"" Ultimately, love it or hate it, Fight Club is a highly effective film.Personally, I think that Fight Club perfectly captures author Chuck Palahniuk's satiric, deadpan tone and style. If you're a fan of Chuck P, satire, black comedy, or anything that is all-around unique, then this movie will be a real thrill-ride. Plus, the acting and visuals are excellent. I thought the movie lost its focus a bit towards the end, but that's only a minor criticism. See it."
1,"Pills too big, upsets my stomach","This did not work on me at all. The pills are too big, you have to take 3 at a time, and it has too many other things like vitamins, herbs, and fillers (which upset my stomach) and not enough MSM. I just started taking ""Natrol MSM 500mg"" and ""Natrol Vegetarian Hyaluronic Acid MSM and Glucosamine 2 pack"" sold by Amazon which seems to work better for fibro issues. I like taking my vitamins in a liquid form (I take Isotonix Multivitamin with iron) so taking vitamins separately from the other supplements works better for me. I am about to order some malic acid supplements so I hope with the malic acid, MSM, glucosamine, and hyaluronic acid supplements, the joint pain will drastically decrease."
4,allergic reaction,i am allergic to citric acid and get skin rashes and hives from it. Just a warning to those who are like me. The malic acid in this supplement made my stomach very sick and then i broke out in hives. I honestly had no idea what malic acid was. I can't say how this product worked for my Fibromyalgia due to the fact i have only taken 3 pills total before i was forced to discontinue. I'm very sad about that after reading the great reviews on this product.
1,"If it Sounds to good to be true, It probably is.","I bought this product hoping for the same results as others with positive reviews,I am willing to try anything to defeat Fibromyalgia. Been taking it for a few weeks now and notice nothing a whole lot different. I think the placebo effect plays a huge role in how this may help you, if you expect it to work miracles, than hey, it just might. It may help others differently, but don't expect this vitamin to be a ""cure"" for your Fibromyalgia. But hopefully it can bring relief to others better than it did for myself."
4,Engrossing,"I finished this book in a weekend. It is written in plain, simple language, and presents the life of a middle aged professor essentially going through a mid-life crisis in Cape Town, South Africa. Following an affair with a student at school, Lurie visits his daughter in the country to get away from the scandal. However, trouble follows, as Lurie and his daughter are subject to a racially motivated crime on her small farm. The crime leaves Lurie floundering, as he tries to pick up the pieces of his life.I thought this was a thought provoking book, and a very engrossing read. It raises questions and thoughts about the political and social atmosphere in South Africa today. Very worthy of the Booker Prize!"
3,very dissapointing for a booker prize,"Coetzee being awarded the booker prize the second time i was really expecting something extraordinary as a writer from him. But he turned out to be a big dissappointment after i read the book. The book came nowhere near ""Feasting, fasting"" by Anita Desai... which lost to coetzee for the booker prize.Though the book deals with complex issues like sexual harrassment, animal rights, relationships etc etc.... and also written very well, it definitely does not leave a lasting impression on ones mind by the end of the read.The book comes to an abrupt halt and the character of Lucy is pretty confusing and disgusting.A big big dissapointment."
4,Shocking and Profound,"I read this book immediately upon my return from South Africa where I had traveled for the first time. Since then I have been haunted by Coetzee's message. The conviction that it stirred in me was that there must be a limit to white guilt. Does every white devil deserve to be mistreated? Personally, I think not. No one deserves to be raped. Like a battered woman who believes that it is her fault, Coetzee's characters David and Lucy are resigned to abuse. Anyone familiar with battered women's syndrome who reads ""Disgrace"" should recognize the pattern that is present. Mr. Coetzee's book is a mirror which reflects SHAME on all those who cause suffering to innocent individuals because they are members of an unwanted group--be they canine or human."
4,A Most Engaging Novel,"Coetzee adroitly lures you into this story by intoducing the reader to an aging academic who is becoming disillusioned with his profession and participating in unbecoming affairs with young students. He justifies his infantile urges by dressing them up in the words of Romantic poets. Although, while discussing the engaging plight of this individual, Coetzee brings you into a discussion of modern South Africa without you exactly realizing what is going on. The end result is an interesting discussion of not only South Africa and this particular individual, but the human condition, our relationships with animals, and the requirements of the human soul. This is a very touching novel that does a good job of concretizing abstract dilemnas into engaging characters placed in moving situations. Well done."
1,Dark and Depressing,"In my quest to acquaint myself with well-regarded contemporary authors, I chose this particular work because it was a winner of the Mann Booker prize several years ago. What a disappointment. The reader is forced to follow the main character through a series of slimy encounters with the underside of South African life-prostitutes, rapists, family members in angst, caged dogs, and gangs of disaffected natives. The work begins and ends on sour notes and I was quite sour by the end.It will be a long time, if ever, before I attempt another novel by this author. There are numerous beautifully written works out there, many of which deal with angst in one form or another, and I am sorry that I wasted my time on this one."
5,A great novel,"Meet David Lurie. An English professor who is going down, and his downfall symbolizes another downfall: The fall of white South Africa. The novel is splendidly written. I've read most of Coetzes books, and although most are great, this is probably his best."
4,What a revealing book!,"By narrating a very personal tale, amazing how much this book revealed without talking about the critical political issues explicitly that influenced the life in question; i guess this duality is reflective of the new politically correct order of social commentary in South Africa. Coetzee never mentions race yet the book is really about little else; written with a strong racial undercurrent about a depressed life in a society dealing with the aftermath of race politics. What a shame that post-Apartheid South Africa has become this jungle where the previously advantaged class have lost all interest in creating a meaningful existence for themselves so lost are they in this new world of injustice, lawlessness and so weighed down they are by historical guilt that they don't dare demand anything anymore. A very revealing work about the imminent doom this country faces, if it's not already there..."
1,"Stupid, overrated book","Let me first say that I love J.M. Coetzee, I think that Waiting for the Barbarians is one of the finest books I've ever read, and I think he is one of the finest living writers around, fully deserving of the Nobel prize.However, I hated Disgrace. I can appreciate the writing at times, but all I remember of the book is a disgusting, morally bankrupt main character, his fat daughter, pointless, unsatisfying sex and violence, and the fact that the book has a non-ending. It is all gloom and doom and misery, and we're supposed to accept this as a masterpiece. Ridiculous.I think this book is terrible and I'd encourage readers to explore his other books before they read this."
3,Somewhat lost,"This was a good book, short and easy to read. But, I felt like I was missing a few points by not knowing any French and by not being familiar at all with South Africa. A few things were left unexplained and maybe these two things would have helped."
5,Reviewer Required Form Field #2,"Nothing personal to the reviewers below but Coetzee's book speaks for itself. It's called literature, and there's more up for grabs than a tricky plot. If the Booker peeps aren't good enough for you, hunt and peck below and hopefully screw up a clean and disturbing read."
3,"A ""Disgrace"" being white?","In his book ""Disgrace"", J. M. Coetzee tries to show the realtion between the former masters and their former slaves - the whites and the blacks in South Africa after the end of apartheid. He wants to clarify the conflict that has arised in the question of guilt and responsibility towards the black population in this country. So he uses David Lurie and his daughter Lucy, who has been raped by three black men, in order to show the conflict."
3,Waiting for a bombshell....,"The read is gripping but all through I was waiting for the sensational ending, which didn't materialize. I wouldn't say the book particularly deals with modern attitudes in South Africa one way or another as many reviewers are raving about, it's simply about a rather non-conformist academic with fairly liberal sexual attitudes. He's a believable fellow with makes him interesting. I got the feeling we are given hints throughout that all is not what it seems, especially around the violent incident at his daughter's farm, that some darker side to the main character would be revealed at the end, but it wasn't, it just fizzles out. In anticipation of this, I couldn't put the book down !!! So I have to say I enjoyed it."
4,A varied and true novel- with strong messages,"I am currently studying this novel for English Literature A Level and to be honest, I think almost everyone can find some if not all of the many messages it drives home to be meaningful. I'm not going to give the plot away but if there's one thing the novel did it was question my own opinions about many issues such as male/female relationships, even though I felt my views were fairly unchangeable. The main character, David Lurie is at the start someone I felt wasn't worthy of much respect or sympathy; by the end of the novel, I felt quite differently. If you appreciate books that challenge your thinking, I recommend this book. Note to other A Level students: it's easy to follow (compared to 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, it's like reading a newspaper). However, if you are easily saddened or depressed (although that's not what the novel is about), I wouldn't recommend it."
4,A powerful portrait of a nation in transition!,"The story is a great read in itself - interesting plot, excellent character developments, and full of surprises - and it is all conveyed in the simplest spartan language, at times a bit too ""edited"". The protagonist remains sympathetic, even during his failures as a professor, father figure, and as a human being in general. As a symbolic read, the novel works quite well, although a bit predictably, in conveying the trembling emergence of the new South Africa - its promise, confusion, instability, brutality and potential."
4,Disgrace,"I, and everyone I know who has read this book, has been deeply disturbed by it. Ones specific reaction depends on ones sex and knowledge of South Africa. The characters lives are painted as an unrelenting misery that can only become worse. Any beauty in the locations is ignored. Coetzee piles on the agony by the shovel full and after the third read I began to wonder if this was not a deliberate exercise to win a Booker. Read it, but not if you're prone to depression."
4,Emotionally difficult,"Even though I did not like the main character, it was still a difficult read emotionally. My book club in general liked it: it raised a lot of ood discussion on rape as a weapon, the politics of South Africa, and the perception of power."
3,mixed feelings on well-written but desolate book,"still trying to decide what i think about this bookon the plus side -- extremely well-written, concise. some of the events are shocking -- coetzee has no problem tackling hard topics like race, rape, sex, hatred, etc., he also writes with insight on male-female relationships, power and race.on the other hand, it took me a while to warm up to david lurie, the main character. no doubt that is intentional but still hard to read about a character who is cold and unfeeling [though this changes as book goes on]. my biggest struggle is with how desolate this book as and how little hope it seems to offer. that may be precisely the author's point and yet personally i found it hard to relate to."
2,Wonderfully Unappreciative,"Well, on a lark I purchased this book and read it quickly. I wasn't sure what to expect but forced myself through it. Definately not my element; I'm used to wizards and dragons and such--this sort of fiction to me I have not a whit of appreciaton for. Maybe I need to become more educated to apprecaite this work, but good lord I think I just wasted a solid 6 hours of my life reading that. Please, Mr. Coetzee, I know you're winning awards and all, but deliver us from this dreary reality and write about some dragons and wizards! I'm thinking in my blissful ignorance that the only people who would enjoy this book have to be the most boring old fossils this earth has produced. Anyway, back to being juvenile."
5,"This was an important, slightly disturbing book","Once again, Coetzee creates an anti-hero who is not entirely likeable. In a refreshing way, he didn't give a complete insight into the mind of the main charactor. Rather, he gave the parts that I as a reader needed to see in order to understand the book as I quickly watched his main charactor, a university professor, fall into disgrace after his affiar with a student is discovered.This is an important, thought-provoking book not only for the story, but also because Coetzee paints a picture of modern South Africa as a backdrop and without judgement."
5,Take your time with this one,"This book can be a ""quick read"". Its prose is spartan and the chapters short. But don't miss out on the rewards you will get by reflecting afterwards on what you've read. Coetzee gives you exactly the information you need, and like a Greek play, where the violence occurs off-stage, your imagination can fill in without limit the horror of what has happened ""between the lines"". The themes of debasement and rape are more than particular to the main character; when read in the context of the whiteman's history in South Africa, these crimes will now deny the former ""Master"" the moral authority to affect the course of events in the new society. Toward the end of the book, the return to the scene of the crime is totally damning and only in the final sentence is the lesson learned."
2,Writer's Promise Unfulfilled,"In ""Disgrace"" David Lurie and his daughter Lucy were given realistic breath of life by Mr. Coetzee. I found the book masterfully written until the last few chapters. I believe the reader was cheated by the incomprehensible ending. I couldn't help thinking that Mr. Coetzee was under deadline and ended this once compelling, enlightening, unsettling study of a man, his daughter, and a changing world in the careless, unintelligible, and ""too neat"" manner that he did. I was very disappointed. I wanted to snatch away his ""Booker Prize""."
1,Masterly written pointless depression,"My first impression with this book was that it was extremely well written, everything that Coetzee choses to describe gives an extra dimension to the scene.After reading it though I was left with one feeling: Hate. I hated that the book left me with a lessened faith in humanity, feeling powerless to the evil things that go on in this world and the pathetic apathy, in lack of a better word, of the main person.Although masterly written, I deeply regret reading this book to such an extent that I want to prevent others from reading it. I wish I could say it gave me nothing, but it ruined some beautiful days."
4,Disgrace,Nice product just as expected. Very prompt delivery. A very satisfactory transaction!!! Would love to order from this seller in future!!! Thanks.
4,Call no man happy until he is dead.,"This book has not the same depth as 'Waiting for the Barbarians'.While 'Waiting' depicts the conflict between personal conscience on the level of the human race as a whole and the conscience of a clan member (a specific unit of the human race), here we encounter effectively a local (South-African) clan war ('the shock of being hated') between black and white.The main character is a disgraced white man who is confronted with the black clan. The theme of the book is: will the white men with 'their history of wrong' survive, and if they do, under what 'disgraced?' circumstances?Like Coetzee's other novels, the writing is intense, although I found the opera chapters rather melodramatic.This book is also a reflection on all kind of 'enriching' (the author's own words) sex, from rape ('When you have sex with someone strange ... isn't it a bit like killing?) over prostitution to raw gymnastics.A worth-while read, but not a masterpiece like 'Waiting for the Barbarians'."
5,A rough ride through modern South Africa...,"J. M. Coetzee is one of those writers who will leave a lingering taste in your mouth for years after reading his novel ""Disgrace"".I found it to be a disturbing look at the new R-A-C-I-S-M that comes from political correctness and the myrad of self-serving minions who believe that two wrongs will make a right.I will be in South Africa in a few weeks. I wonder if I will see his reality or something else. Only the future reveals..."
2,PC'd into greatness,"This novel tackles an ""important"" subject -- race relations in South Africa. Somehow because of that, it gets elevated into greatness. It's a good novel, albeit a depressing one, with not very sympathetic characters. It seems to flow naturally, if depressingly along. But only the PC crowd, or those fascinated by train wrecks, will sing its praises."
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"Don't buy into all the pseudo-intellectualism surrounding this book. In the end, it offers absolutely nothing to the reader. There are no timeless themes or lessons. There are not any poignant lines that will be quoted by future writers and commentators. The two main characters make decisions at every turn that are practically inexplicable, and neither form an archetype to be discussed by the generations (i.e. Holden Caulfield, Hamlet, or Kurtz). The book leaves loose ends all over the place and major themes of the book are completely unresolved. Does this writer have talent? Yes. His prose is good. But as a novel...as a piece of literature, this does not hold a candle to anything that most of the literary world considers the ""classics."""
3,Decent but worth the hype?,"I appreciated that ""Disgrace"" gave me some insight into some aspects of modern South African social dynamics, but I wasn't too impressed with the narrative. It was slow moving and meandering, kind of like the main character, but it was frustrating to read as my attention kept drifting off in other directions. Yes, there are some ""shocking"" moments in the latter half of the book, but whether that merits the book reaping in so many accolades is up for debate in my opinion. Still, a worthy read regardless."
3,Well written,"This book is rather disappointing. Although it is beautifully written with a language that is fresh and subtle, the story is at best tragic and evocative, at worst unbelievable and depressing.I recommend this book for its writing. It is a pleasure to read. The atmosphere and the characterization is brilliant. Just dont take the actual plot too seriously - the end is confusingly unmeaningful."
5,A work of art,"Disgraced Prof. Lurie, seeking respite in his daughter's rural homestead was victimized by a violent crime that shook his grasp of human relationships to the foundation. Coetzee's concise prose and understated plot of self discovery in the backdrop of racially conflicted S. Africa is a work of art."
4,"Frustrating, but fasinating","I kept trying to like the protagonist, kept trying to feel some sympathy. But he is an extremely dislikeable man - one you would instinctively avoid if you were a savvy woman. And yet a man many would be taken in by. And so I kept reading, a sign of good writing, I think. A good read, if you understand life does not always end happily ever after."
5,Highly recommended,"I enjoyed this honest and compassionate book. Coetzee doesn't ask us to solve the world's problems, and he doesn't make his characters the best, cutest, nicest people on earth. He puts flawed but well-meaning people in difficult circumstances and gives them just enough will to persevere. Since we're all just trying to make sense of what the world hands us, a book that tells the unflinching truth deserves reading."
3,Three stars for good writing,"But the plot is all over the place. I am not sure what other reviewers saw in this book. It has at least two completely separate plots, that should not have been combined in such a short novel. The main character, Lurie, is unattractive, sure, but we are just getting into the story of his disgracing himself and losing his job, and the young girl he bullied into having an affair with him, when suddenly he leaves town and goes to stay with his daughter, a farmer in a dangerous part of the country. Not long after his arrival, they are attacked, and the daughter is raped, but refuses to get the police involved. Is she apologizing for her race? Her father? Does it matter? Both plots are given short shrift here, in my opinion. I am inclined to believe that the author won the prizes he won because he is South African and has tackled difficult subjects, such as black hatred of whites. The writing is good in places, true, but this is not a coherent novel."
2,"""Disgrace"" was my disgrace","This book is interesting on the one hand, but in the whole the reading has been an agony. Contents are very controversial in addition, excitingly. In a very aggressive way J.M. Coetzee represents the situation in the today's south Africa. Throughout the novel the characters represent certain issues, South Africa has to deal with nowadays. Therefore ""Disgrace"" is a recommendation to those who are interrested in the present South Africa and its time after the abolishment of apartheid."
4,"I hope that,,,",I hope that the cruise-ships don't stop for the 'new' South Africa as portrayed in this tightly-written novel by J. M. Coetzee.
1,"Not a 'Dsgrace, but pretty Awful'","This author can write, but he wastes his talent by making characters act in a non credible way(and I mean non credible even for the character). I do not beleive an intelligent man would not read the charges at his university tribuneral, even if he is going to plead guilty (they could say anything). I do not beleive once he saw the people who had gang raped his daughter he did not call the police. His daughter, originally a strong minded individual turns into a pathetic punchbag. This might be understandable if she was in denial about the rape, but she chooses to embrace the event, staying in the same place, WITh the the people who did it. Im fine with a book that does not have a happy ending or discusses the just transfer of powers in South Africa, but this book was a mess and just not creidble"
1,Detatched and a little pompous,"This book certainly makes sense in its own terms. Like all his fiction it deals with South African politics through contemporary philosophy. But it feels like the events aren't unfolding as they do in real life, which is not always in accordance with philosophical literary theoretical models.The book therefore feels somewhat pompous as a result.The characters never approach anything that is substantial. This is probably why he is able to create such a purely philosophical novel.The author clearly has a very detatched perspective on the world and perhaps prefers the safety of books and ideas to real events."
2,"For a Bad Taste, Read This","There must be redemeeming material in this novel, as it is esteemed already. However, I could not find it. More simply, it left me with a bad taste. All characters are pathetic and in my eye, found no redemption. This is based on gut feeling alone, obviously: ugh."
3,Restrained tale about guilt and denial.,"Disgrace is a story about a sinful nation that, because of its past sins, cannot feel justified rage at the new injustices that are now being perpetrated on the minority white population. Yes, it's elegant, sparse, economical, etc. but underneath this whited sepulchre (even the book jacket is a sparse, clean, white cover) is an ugly reality that the promised myth of peace and reconciliation isn't happening. The disgrace lies in the inability, or refusal, of people like Lurie's daughter to condemn the outrages of her attackers. I read the book over 7 months ago, so I'm working from memory. Maybe mine is a misreading. I believe that the author's restraint and sparse style are a fine stylistic technique, but I was ultimately left frustrated by the hopelessness that this style represents."
3,Why?,"Though I enjoyed this novel, the most common thought that I had while reading was ""why?"" I found that I could not relate to a single character in the book. While I understand that the novel is based in a part of the world racked with change, I could not grasp the situations or character's motivation. They seem so absurd under any circumstances. The entire plot seemed more like fantasy than realistic fiction. However, the desire to relate to the characters or understand their personalities makes the book compelling."
2,Will put you in a bad mood and crush your spirit.,"Another example of ""literature"" that gets that moniker by virtue of being dark, depressing, anxiety producing and pointless. It has the most flagrantly negative ending since Romeo and Juliet which is a roaring comedy in comparison. If you enjoy that, you may get off on reading this annoying, condescending, purposefully grim little book."
4,Emotion/though provoking (w/out the unnecessary fluff),"It's a very well written book that pulls its reader along willingly... It makes no bones about character introduction and behavior, yet you find yourself attempting to understand them even better. The story line itself is creative and uncomplicated. I felt it stirred the ideas of peace and acceptance (once you've read it, you'll understand I don't mean the sociological/political sort). I read it in under a week, which surprised me due to a busy schedule. It wasn't until after I'd closed it that its depth really went to work. A few weeks have gone by, and I still find myself mulling it over."
5,"Change brings pain, loss...","Curious to know about life in the 'new' South Africa, and still eager to read those books that transport me to a form of life not my own, I sat down to read this recent Booker Prize-winning novel; it made a deep and abiding impression on me, because it is so replete with moments of exquisite pain and almost bridegroom tenderness. Other reviewers have supplied a synopsis of the plot, so I will resist the lure to summarize for the umpteenth time, but I do want to say that the protagonist is a complex man with complex motives, making him one of the most fascinating and engaging characters I have ""encountered"" in a very long time -- moody, introspective, seemingly recalcitrant, capable of love and concern, even if at a distance, and not at all unaffected by the momentous societal shifts taking place all around his fragile frame."
2,Disgrace a typo for Despair?,"I was deeply disturbed by this novel. I dislike David for he ""never got it."" He rationalized his actions in lofty romantic Byronic terms, and he never once realizes that he too has committed rape because he mislabels it as desire. He even goes on to say how it enriched his life and ""hers""? Yet that line of reasoning is left behind when his own daughter experiences rape by three black men because of the ""violent"" overtones. There is no redemption even though he has opportunities to redeem himself. His daughter Lucy also makes extremely bad choices that are not redemptive in any way. I realize many people never ""get it"", but I thought the reason literature existed is to show us those moments of illumination in the human psyche. This was too despairing for me. His life is empty because he is unable to see the richness, and he has passed on that inability to his daughter."
1,A disgrace to modern literature,"How disgraceful it is for this book to have received a Booker. The Lurie character's blatant lack of regard for women and his utter misunderstanding of sexuality is a disgrace. If such a book can receive such high acclaim today, then feminism still has far to go. I am saddened that other reviewers failed to express any concern for the portrayal of women in this book. Even the charater Lucy was troubling. Her actions did not seem consistent with her ideals. Further, I did not find the prose compelling."
2,depressing - don't bother,At first this book shows geat potential with the possibilty of an interesting plot.... which goes nowhere. David goes from one depressing situation to another and learns nothing from his past mistakes. Don't bother reading this for fun. I kept reading hoping that something interesting would happen. It was like sitting through a bad movie hoping that something good was going to unfold.
1,Disgrace is a Disgrace,"Disgrace by J. M. Coetzee is one of the worst novels I have ever read. It does not have a clear message; there is nothing to learn out of it. It is better to spend the time watching a good movie or any TV program than reading this silly novel. It was the winner of the ""1999 Booker Prize"", what may me think that the ""Booker Prize"" is valueless."
5,stayed with me,"Although I read this book when it first was published, it has continued to haunt me. Not only is it well written, but also thought provoking and emotionally riveting. I felt that I knew these people and understood - if not agreed with - their viewpoints. Coetzee made them real, flawed and familiar. Highly recommended."
4,Well Deserved Booker,"After resigning in disgrace from his University position, David Lurie, an expert on the Romantics, becomes involved in his daughter's post-colonial difficulties. The Byronesque professor's life is gradually transformed over the course of this spare novel. He begins his exile planning an opera about Byron and one of his loves Teresa - he is left with a guitar and the mournful voice of a lonely middle aged woman. He arrives at his daughter's farm in time for her brutal rape. His next visit finds her 'staying on' under the protection of her rapists relative. The novel is filled with ambiguity and nuance. The reader will find it difficult to leave the characters and their shifting relationships between the covers."
4,cargofrog,"This is a very interesting account of a man's trials in life. It takes place in South Africa. This is a mix of aging, culture, and inner struggle between subjective and objective feelings. It is difficult to give up something or someone that your love, but true love is letting go at times."
2,Remarkable,"Remarkable.Remarkable that this book won a Booker Prize.I've been meaning to read Coetzee for some time, after seeing the prizes he's won, and had high expectations. Perhaps this is not considered one of his better works, but based on other reviews, I see that inexplicably, some people actually liked this book.The characters were not only dislikeable, but completely unrealistic.We're to believe that Lucy after being gang-raped, would continue to live on her farm, even though she acknowledges that in so doing, she is likely to be attacked again.The lectures on English literature made the novel even harder to bear.I find it a Disgrace that such a novel wins the Booker Prize, when other greater novels such as Rohinton Mistry's ""A Fine Balance"" or Margaret Atwood's ""Oryx and Crake"" do not."
2,What's the Buzz?,"I heard a lot about this book and felt that I was missing something by not reading it. I don't get it. I found the protagonist to be difficult to identify with. I found other characters not well developed--so I could not ""feel"" for them. The topic of rape was touched on--but there was no resolution for me the reader. I understand that part of the story was a documentary on life in South Africa--so in that I can appreciate some of the plot and conflict within the story. Perhaps you will enjoy the story more if you have visited the area. The one saving grace for the book was the fact that it had a theme regarding the dangerous consequences of bad judgement. We have all been in situations that didn't seem to ""be a big deal"" but later ended up being ordeals. This is a good example of a bad decision costing much."
3,not certain,"Loved Barbarians so I checked this book out. In the end I wasn't quite certain. It's well written but didn't grab me like it should have. Not sure what else to say. There are some deep parts and great moments between the characters, all the while playing on the post-apartheid world. Nevertheless it doesn't seem like his best work."
2,Ghastly,"This arch, posturing novel is bloodless, unaffecting, prissy-pants, and reeks of falsity. No fictional reality is created; instead, there is a haphazard, tossed-off quality. Most of the events are drained white of any drama or power, presumably purposely. I need to reread Tom Sharpe's big-hearted South Africa books, Riotous Assembly and Indecent Exposure, to cleanse my palate of this pinched, fussy thing."
2,Totally depressing,I found this book to be totally depressing. The killing of dogs left me with nightmares. This book may have been well written but I was depressed for days after I read it. If you want to be depressed by all means read this book.
4,A likeable protagonist,"Learned without being heavy, the novel acquainted me with the life of a character I would normally feel nothing in common with and made him truly likeable, despite his peculiar behavior, which in fact makes him all the more human."
5,I remember now why I read,"Half way through this book I thought "" I remember now why I read."" At once suspenseful - I wanted to know page by page What Next? Why? Who? When? How? - and philosophical - not philosophical in the sense of ""How many angels will fit on the end of a pin?"" but philosophical in the sense of "" What is a human? Does life, including animal life, matter?"" cf Primo Levi, as well as forcing the reader to reflect on one's own motives, desires, attitudes, values. I remember that reading provides the richest source of answers to all questions, and adds much to one's own journey. I'm going to leave it for a month and reread this work."
2,Bewilderingly overrated.,"I'm sorry. I don't understand this man's standing. He has won more Bookers than anyone else, which means he's better than Rushdie, MacEwan, Byatt, right? I have to be missing something - the prose is determinedly mediocre, the treatment of violence and its effects is crass, the analysis of modern South Africa unenlightening. The main character is less offensive than a bore. It's not all bad - the university showtrial is genuinely frightening, and the passages about the dogs, with their mixture of horror, tenderness and emotional blankness are almost moving. More of this and it could have been a tolerable novel, but, once again vast social and gender issues are reduced to the self-pity of a middle-class white male."
4,Disgrace,"Disgrace is not a new book, but I had never read it. Although it is quite a short novel, it is a fascinating story. It takes place in South Africa shortly after the end of apartheid. The story begins with the disgraceful behavior of a professor and end with violence against his daughter. The atmosphere in which these things happen is filled with a sense of longing for the past, which, although filled with bad decision, was ordered and predictable. I would,(and have) recommend this book."
2,watch at your own risk,"Most people at some point or another catch the drift that Columbus landed in San Salvador and is credited with dicovering the Americas. Now comes this movie to show us how. For some reason certain historical events do not translate onto the screen, and this is one of them. The problem with this movie is that it takes an already difficult subject matter and makes it even worse. I give it two stars because it is barable to a comic level. If you understand that it is bad you could enjoy certain parts, such as Tom Sellick as the King of Spain. Brando fans should stay clear of this one because his role is small and of no consequese and leaves you then with just a bad flick. If this historical event intrests you, I recommend 1492, it is much better."
1,Absolutely nothing to recommend here......,"The historical equivalent of a comic book, this incomprehensible waste of time is bound to be seen as Brando's worst ever screen appearance (it might also be said of Tom Selleck, but when has he had a good one?) Boring, inaccurate (the streets of the 15th century have never looked so clean), and acted with all the fire of a high school play, the film never escapes its lamebrained script. Okay, let's get back to Brando: what was he thinking? Does he need to remind us of how far he has fallen since his glory days in the 1950s?"
3,Marlon Brando?,"with a very brief appearance by Brando in the beginning and early performances by Catherine Zeta Jones and Benicio Del Toro i wasnt quite sure what to expect but was hoping for the best.i for one was having a hard time following this movie Benicio Del Toro managed to hold my attention in his brief although powerful appearances.the characters were supposed to be Spanish,Portuguese and the indiginous peoples of the carribean is what i was thinking going into this but to my dismay(with the exception of Del Toro) there were an array of television stars from the mid ninteen eighties.this was more of a fantasy pirate movie than a historical one."
5,Got me through college,The Accounting Handbook was very helpfull during my time in college accounting courses. It has since be a very helpfull desk reference in my practice. One can't go wrong with the price of this very handy volume. There are chapters on various topics ranging from basic accounting to value added accounting. There is also a very handy glossary/dictionary of hundreds of accounting and IT terms.
1,Book has bad title,"I was very unhappy with this accounting textbook. With almost 500 pages devoted to defining accounting terminology out of a 1,000 page book, Siegel/Schim should have titled it ""An Accounting Dictionary with some shallow chapters on Accounting."" The remaining 500 pages gave only a shallow review of accounting procedures. Space dedicated to business accounting is lost because there is a chapter on doing personal tax returns and one on personal financial planning. This personal aspect doesn't belong since the book's title, ""Accounting Handbook"" implies business accounting. Now if the authors are trying to connect a business owner's decisionmaking with his personal planning, than why were there no chapters on partnership and corporate tax planning or income tax preparation? The chapter on non-profits was a terribly short 15 pages long. There is no discussion of G/L, AP, AR or other mundane, but required basics of accounting."
4,External Skin Cream,My only negative is the texture feel of the cream. Excellent on sensitive skin. My skin is very smooth and moisturized. I will continue to buy it.
5,Eternal,"As the name says itself ETERNAL- by using this cream you can keep your skin young and beautiful for years! After applying it, you can feel this cream working on your skin, repairing, nourishing, making your skin looking radiant. I love this product, I'll use it forever!"
2,Skin looks great but....,"this stuff burns my eyes! I have used it for a few weeks and I was so happy with how my skin looks I didn't realize that this is why my eyes were burning every morning. I am careful not to get it in my eyes, but when I wake up it almost feels like pink-eye (but it's not). I'm fine once I put my contacts in, and I'm fine when I don't use the lotion, but if I try to go back to it, my eyes burn. The smell is strong but not too bad, and my skin is smoother (not tight, but fresh feeling), but I can't imagine this is good for my eyes so I'll need to stop."
2,for younger women,"Ifind this to be effective when first applied,it is temporary.I find the Dr. Oz show tried to make you believe it would do a lot more than it does.Maybe if you started to use it at a young age (35) or so it might help. It's a temporary fix.I'm disappointed."
2,Breakout,I used the cream on face & neck for about a week when my face got bumps all over it. I stopped using on my face & just use it on my neck & hands. So far my neck & hands are breakout free. I'll try to update in a month or so to see what happens. I guess you could say this stuff makes you look young like a teenager.... w/ acne. Bummer. :(
2,"Way to perfumey, blech.","I wanted to love this cream! The smell is way to strong and I don't remember the last time I used a face cream that I could actually taste also, Ew! Ive been using it awhile (over a month) and I don't see any huge improvements. I don't want to waste it and throw it out but I really don't want to put this on my skin anymore. It's a little burny too and sometimes makes my eyes water and I can smell and feel my tears taking this stuff off my face. This cream has pushed me to the end of the line with store bought products and I'm finally just going to have to break down and make my own from scratch with natural oils, beeswax, etc.UPDATE: It's a lot better now that I've been watering it down. I take a little cream on the tips of my fingers and run a little water over it and rub it into my face which drowns out the thickness, smell and burn. I don't plan to buy it again but at least I can use the rest. It's pretty great at smoothing out skin and fine lines."
4,it is gooddddddd!!!,"it has not done miracles with my fine lines but my skin tone is even, I purchased because I was watching Dr. OZ and he recommended DMAE for wrinkles, skin tone and overall healthy complexion. 2 weeks after use I can say that it really helped clear my whiteheads, Im using in conjuction with the skin eternal serum by source naturals as well, all in all Im happy with the results and will buy these products again without hesitation, it is suppose to show real results within a month or two so keeping fingers cross, hopping it will reduce those fine lines around my eyes."
2,Made my skin ouchy!,"Got this product, looking for a cheaper alternative to Perricone's version. After about 3 days of using it, my face is raw, red and swollen.Feels like a bad sunburn. My neck has a rash and was itching like crazy.Too bad, cause I did like the consistancy and smell of the product.But, taking it back to where I got it. I advise trying to find it locally and sampling it first to see if your skin likes it. Currently, my skinis very pissed off and taking it all out on me!"
2,Smells bad,Even if this product worked I just couldn't get past the smell long enough to know for sure. I'm going to try it on my hands next just to see if it works but I sure can't recommend this product if you want to use it anywhere near your nose.
2,Smells awful!,My husband can't abide the smell so after 3 nights I've stopped using it. 'Fresh kiwi scent' is definitely an inappropriate descriptor because if kiwis smelled like this most people wouldn't eat them.
4,What is that smell?,"I really like the way my skin feels when I use this cream...I can be absolutely parched, and this immediately makes my skin feel soft and supple. THAT being said...I've been trying to pin down the SMELL for months...buttered popcorn isn't it, but it's always the first thing that comes to mind. If that doesn't bother you, you might just like this!"
4,Pure slash trash goodness,"A definite obscurity from the big slasher flood of the early 80s. This one employs a supernatural element which gives it a slightly more original twist than similar films in the genre. Watch out for a truly creepy dream sequence replete with a deformed killer and those nasty-sounding synths that we've all come to know and love in low-budget horrors of this sort. Misogynists are in luck as most of the victims are women (and lots of them nude!); a detail which ups the sleaze content considerably higher than usual. Overall, not a perfect film, but if you're nostalgic for 80's slashers it's definitely worth a look. Thank you for this little treat Satan... I love you!"
3,"Nice Panda, not really baby-safe","My wife and I purchased this panda for our daughter's first Christmas. I didn't really do enough research ahead of time. There isn't anything wrong at all with the bear, other than I don't really feel that it is safe for younger children. This one is definitely an example of where to follow the suggested age range by the MFG. The eyes and a star on the bear's foot could definitely be bitten off and swallowed by a youngster."
1,Didn't work,"We bought a wall phone for our new home, and bought this long cord to use with it. The first time I tried to answer the phone with the new cord on it, the person on the other end could not hear me, but I could hear them fine. I thought it was a fluke, but it happened several times. I made sure the cord was plugged in well, but that still didn't work. So, I put the cord back on that came with the phone, and it worked fine. I didn't save the receipt, so I'll just throw the cord away. Very disappointed."
2,"Poor quality, IMO.","I think we are all becoming acclimated to getting lesser quality products. If you are old enough to remember when AT&T, GE and other brands represented the best of products being made, I am quite disappointed in this item. The new ATT phone from Walmart is not much better and see no other option for replacement for that either. Will just have to make do. My very old cord still looks better, unfortunately it no longer offered noise free use."
4,Satisfied,"Works as expected except weight of cord causes handset of AT&T 950 to slip out of cradle, a deficiency of the phone not the cord."
5,Great Cord,This cord works fine and appears to be much better quality than that found in the dollar type stores. Time will tell!
4,Good communications,This product fixed my problem. It meets the speces I needed and was delivered on time.
5,Nice extension cord,"Nice product, but don't expect it to look the same after a few months use - it grows in physical length."
4,cord,It was fine. Long enough to stretch and walk around with the phone. Very practical and seems sturdy even to withstand stretching.
1,DOA GE Handset Cord,"I would have given 0 stars if I could. Should have read all the reviews before buying. This GE handset Cord was DOA. I discovered that I could hear , but the oher party could not hear me. I have a GE phone. You would think if this cord was ever going to work it would be with a GE phone -that was the reason I selected this particular one.I don't have any paperwork with this phone and I have apparently throw away the packaging. I will not bother to try to return it. I'll just go to the Dollar store and pick up one for $4.95."
1,Save money - this doesn't work,"I fell for the bargain price. Not a bargain when it doesn't work. At least not with my new Panasonic phone. (By the way, other ""over the counter"" ones do, as does the (shorter) cord shipped with the phone. So...it's not the phone.)"
1,D.O.A.,Testing must be at a premium in China. Swapped in this longer cord and lost out bound communication with phone. Fortunately at $7 not a big deal or worth the hassle of a return.
5,Cord set,Worked just fine. This is not easy to review it either works or it does not.It this case it worked.
1,NOT HAPPY,"I purchased a new phone for my kitchen wall and a 25 foot cord. I had to return the phone as it did not work with my connection,. It was really made for a table even though it was advertised as a wall phone. Postage and 20% restocking charge.Then I received the 25ft cord and it does not work. When you place it on the phone it will not disconnect. The phone is always on. My husband was in electronics for many years and he is not sure what they did to it. I am throwing it away as it will cost me more money to return the thing. I am not a happy customer of AMAZON."
1,VERY UNHAPPY,"When I attached this cord, the phone kept on giving me a busy signal. Then I discovered the busy signal was on all my phones. Put the old cord back and it works okay. Also this cord was thrown in with my other packages,loose. It was not packaged, there was no way of knowing what brand it was, and there was no receipt. Worst purchase ever from Amazon. Should have bought a cord like this at a local hardware store."
5,A blast from Finland,Tik 'n tak are a special group of girls who are truly talented and have a killer album. Friends is really an album that is worth of getting! The level of the album is really high and if you're into pop-music you'll definitely love them. The album mixes pop and rock together into beautiful harmony. I'd recommend everybody to take a chance and listen to this masterpiece. True pop art.
4,Advanced users only,"The title of the book may be misleading.Attention, this book is for advanced readers in Condensed matter physics. Actually, the book is mostly consisted of some good papers selected by by Anderson. A beginner can read this after he get to know the ""basic notions"" from basic books."
5,I loved this book,"I recently read this book while taking a plane trip from Vt. to NC. It was so interesting to me, that I was able to finish it just before arriving at my destination. I thought this was such a well written book. It kept my interest throughout the entire book. Joyce wasn't afraid to be open and honest about her shortcomings and things she has struggled with over the years. I could relate to all of that. As well as many of the other interesting life experiences. It helped me to look at some of the ways that I handle problems when they come along. And to confirm that what I should be doing on a daily basis, is trusting God more, and remember that he knows what I need much better than I do. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It was a great book and an easy read. Thank you Joyce."
2,Defend Clinton?,"Man, this is tough. I am not a fan of recent presidents, Clinton included. However, this is a bit over the top. Why in this country can we not accept that things like a center fuel tank exploding, as heartbreakingly ordinary as it sounds, could be the cause of a jet crashing into the sea? Yes, I did read this book, but even though the information is presented in a compelling way (hence 2 stars as opposed to one) it is , as far as I can tell, an example of the authors believing something to be so going in, and interpreting certain things to prove it. I would never say that the authors are cynical and mindless and lying to prove a point. They seem passionate in their beliefs and I have no doubt they are concerned what the ramifications of what they believe happened would be going forward. I just don't believe that what they believed happened happened."
1,He Hates Clinton,"While some of the evidence could be considered compeling if properly presented, it holds little water in the ""I Hate Clinton"" context.I am sure Cashill learned more about evidence while earning his Phd at Purdue. Apparently WND has focused the fear mongering and hate side of Cashill and blinded him to ""good"" research. His recent book ""hoodwinked"" though outs his haterd for academia, so maybe he did not learn much in West Lafayette, just honed his dislikes.But this wonderful (puke, gag) piece of work has found its place into Amazon's top 20,000.............. woooohooooo, go jack.You should check out his doctorile thesis on capitalism and fictional heros, another steller work............ you go jack, jack for dog catcher............. maybe he can round up farah, coulter, ""oxycontin"" rash and oreally, agents of the dark side....... the anti-truth tellers....."
4,Washed out,"I've viewed this book side by side with the Hasselblad Award Book, and I find the quality of the printing in 2 1/4 to be inferior to that in the Hasselblad volume. I think the selection of the photos is excellent, but the reproductions in this particular book are somewhat washed out. With an artist such as Eggleston,the color printing process is essential to communicating his vision. I found the quality of the printing in this book to be a disservice to his art."
4,A fine addition to the Eggleston catalog,"This is a beautiful book, and those familiar with the photographer's work over the years will recognize his visual flair for color and love of the mystery in commonplace objects. In response to the previous reviewer, who was disappointed with the quality of image reproduction, I think the problem lies in the aging of the source negatives and/or transparencies...the sad but inevitable changes wrought by time. Twin Palms has done a fine job with this volume of early work by a master photogarapher."
2,Stay clear of this one!!,"I have always enjoyed listening to the Beginner's series of music, but this is the first time I was not so impressed. Some very poor soundtrack recordings spanning from 1947 -77. I have only listened to cd 3, could the other 2 cd's be better? To be honest, what is the big deal about Bollywood!!! Like most popular Asian music, they can only mimic other cultures."
5,Well worth having in your library,Very helpful and informative with a wide range of tile information from making the tiles to installing them. Many good ideas.
5,A good idea,"I am research engineer and inventor of shock absorbers. So I consider that it is very important for specialists to have at their disposal a complete catalogue of solutions, conditions, damping characteristics, even comfort, handling, adherence parameters and specific words.Unfortunately, I do not have got this book, so I cannot do a real review about it.Adrian NICULESCUAutomobile Dacia Factory"
3,Excellent acting despite poor production/scriptwriting.,"As usual, Spike Lee's cast of actors and actresses are far more powerful than the cookie cutout characters created by Spike Lee. The interracial dating subject is so tired and boring, I am about to scream! Also, I can't help but wonder why a prominent African American film-maker like Lee always casts his ""own"" (Black) females in a secondary light to a White or non-Black woman. Perhaps this is to make his films popular at the expense of the dignity of African American woman. Anyway, I LOVED the actors and acting but Spike Lee's work SUCKS!"
1,Jungle fever movie,"It would be kind of hard to go a good review for this movie, because the movie did not play good at all. I could not even watch the movie with all the lines on the screen. It was also a VHS tape ."
5,Jungle Fever,My video came in timely manner. And it was in very good quality! I was also very pleased with the price!
2,Too formulaic and unconvincing,"Lee is always brimming with good intentions. Yet as fine as they may be, this film is hardly convincing. The romance between Snipes and Sciorra is not particulary invigorating, the premise is contrived, the metaphorical, two-dimensional atmosphere Spike tries to create is really farcical, and the whole thing is handled rather uncharismatically. Not to mention, it's doggedly overlong and pretentious."
3,Interesting,"This movie was great, although, I believe that the plot could have been improved had there not been a wife in the picture. It displays that there is something wrong with interracial couples, no matter the circumstances. Would anyone have approved if he had not been married? Of course the man should not have cheated on his wife, yet, if she had been black, would everything ended better? I feel that the controversy should have been over the adultry, not on the man's choice of the color of the woman he cheated with.On the other hand, writing in a change of heart on Wesley's part was great. He returned to his wife and saved his marriage."
4,Wesley is so good,"He has so much talent, a terrific build, handsome, he looks like he really takes good care of himself. And you never hear anything bad about him in the tabloids. I really enjoyed this movie, not for the story, I just really enjoyed looking at Wesley he should do more nude scenes, he certainly has the body for it. Yum"
3,Don't believe the hype!,"This movie is ok. Its not great, its not spectacular, its just ok. This movie is a love story. The only thing this movie has is name recognition. The fact that this movie has the dudes who played in the venoms series doesn't make it any better. The fact that this movie was made by the Shaw Brothers doesn't change a thing! It needed more action and more killing! There was some but...not enough. If your buying this movie to collect a Shaw Bros. classic then yeah buy it for that reason but for something to watch buy something else!"
3,...IN A 5 PART SERIES,"THERE WAS ACTUALLY A 5TH PART TO THE SERIES - THE TITLE ""LITTLE DRAGON MAIDEN"""
1,DISGRACE to Shaw Brother & All Other Kungfu Movies!!!,"This movie deserves 0 stars but unfortuanitly i have to put 1 (-_-)THIS IS NOT A KUNGFU MOVIE!!!its a Corny-Ass love story(on sum Titanic iSh)with [...] characters,a stupid plot(that totally switches up!OMGosh the moviestarts off with a decent(martial arts)story but as soon as this guymeets a girl EVERYTHING CHANGES!& the original story is abandoned.[...]"
5,makita 9910x 5.6 amp 3x18 inch belt sander,"What a deal! The perfect little sander for my woodshop..... if you need a good little belt sander, buy this one."
2,Mediocre Sander,"Ordinarily you use a belt sander to remove a fair amount of stock otherwise you would use a random orbital or finish sander. With that goal in mind this sander is underpowered, poorly balanced and just doesn't meet expectations for using this type of sander."
4,Great All-purpose Belt Sander,Great All-purpose Belt Sander - Makita 9910X 5.6 Amp 3-by-18-Inch Belt Sander with Cloth Dust Bag and 5 Sanding Belts. Our construction business has many sanders. This is the belt sander our crews have on-board.
1,Lasted about an hour - sparks were flying!,"I purchased this sander to do some medium duty sanding/stripping on doors and woodwork. Overall, it was a tight little sander, very comfortable to hold and operate. The belts, like on the other Makita models, were easy to load and use. Material removal was decent, but the 5.6 A motor may be too small for the weekend wannabe contractor. The 5 belts that came with it were a good selling point, too.But after only an 45 min to an hour of use, the motor began to spark at high rpm and no load. White sparks were visible through the motor vent on the side, and there was a definite loss of motor torque. This went along with a popping sound coming from the sander (and my lights flickering in my house). I'm guessing the motor was shorting to the brushes at high speed.Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this tool and luckily was able to return it. I would opt for a higher amp motor and a different brand sander like I did."
3,Not the great poet he is claimed to be,"When I was 18 (50 years ago), I was introduced to this grossly overrated poet. I preferred traditional poetry, and did not even have much use for Whitman. I forced myself to read all of Eliot's poems. The mind shudders at the very thought. I much prefer James Elroy Flecker, whose poetry is completely different and so much better. Perhaps some of Eliot's prose writings deserve to survive, but he just isn't a great poet."
4,"A great book, but I can't see myself the reason Pedita loves John...","A really good book with a good storyline and real life characters. John is unbelievable though, and extremely violent. I can't see why Perdita likes him.What makes me sad is no one else seems to have read this book, and it's a really good one that I'm sure you'll enjoy."
3,A Classic,"Harold Lamb's venture into the fiction field is a slightly disguised political treatise that is ahead of its time. Still, it is skillfully done and makes for enjoyable reading."
1,it sucked,I dont recomend this book to any one unless they have extreme brain failure or like drinking from the toilet
2,Disappointing,"Very, very disappointing. The Big Brother theme is an exciting piece of music but the other tracks? No, not so exciting and, in the main, old. The tracks aren't mixed (shame!) and most, if not all, are short radio edits.In short, the Big Brother series was new and exciting. The theme was new and exciting. The soundtrack is dated and mediocre. Sorry!Buy a new Paul Oakenfold cd instead."
3,Decent but not extraordinary,"Somewhat underrated, Geoff McBride has some qualities that make him a fine singer. He's got a good voice, he's not subversive, and he doesn't brag about cheating. Unfortunately, he came around at the same time as several other more well-established singers like him. It's not a bad album, but period pieces by the likes of Keith Sweat, Levert, and others tend to be generally better albums."
4,Fine debut!,"I still remember this album! I don't know why Geoff McBride wasn't given the push with this album. He could have given singers like Gerald Levert, Babyface, Johnny Gill and others in 1990 a run for their money if this album had more hits. I still love No Sweeter Love, Gotta Good Thing, the title song and Good Old Days, which he wishes things now would be like then, even in this modern Internet crazy world we're in now. Gerald brought soulful vocals on every song here, even the more uptempo songs. I still think that his best moments are in the ballads. Geoff, wherever you are, I thought you made a good album and you were just a strong talent back in 1990, even if the music history books don't want to acknowledge it."
5,A video on the Kalachakra Mandala,"This is a video about the Kalachakra Mandala. Very helpful for those trying to start a Kalachakra practice. Definitely amazing for those who don't know anything about the subject or ""think"" they know.This is the real thing.Very nice."
3,Great filmography - no substance,"German filmmaker Werner Herzog as usual is exceptional at film and captures everyday life of Buddhists on their pilgrimage to Bhod Gaya. We concentrate on the 12 day Kalachakra initiation. For those familiar with Buddha you recognize Bhod Gaya as the location where the Buddha attained enlightenment.There is great background music much of it sounds a little more Hindu. However, we do hear some well-known chants. Occasionally there is conversation with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. In addition, get a glimpse of a few people mugging for the camera.All in all this film is worth watching but does not give any real insight or surprises.Little Buddha"
3,"Great Song Selection, BUT...","One of the best songs on this CD (Runaway) was recorded very poorly. The vocals & the synthesizer are very pronounced but the percussion is barely audible. The rest of the tracks have ""so so"" sound quality. I didn't care for Del's performance of some of the songs made famous by Roy Orbison & The Beatles. I say, ""If ya can't improve on it, leave it alone."""
1,Written by a Mathematician Not a Teacher,"I was curious about the content of this book. All I had to do was read the first two pages. Good grief, no wonder kids hate math. I became a math teacher because of all the lousy math teachers I had to indure in high school ( and yes, then in college!) -- We have got to get rid of these ""nerds"" they suck all the joy out of the subject. Yes, I said JOY. I have always loved math and found it fun and exciting and that is the way I have tried to teach is for the last 30 years. You will find no joy in this book. I would like to ask these authors what is the equation for JOY? (They probably just would not get what I meant. -- I am rolling my eyes.)"
3,Good not amazing.,"Pros: It's not a concentrate, but it's very strong so I use less for each shampoo than with other whitening shampoos.Cons: It's expensive and I didn't see a significant difference in my dogs white coat compared to other whitening shampoos.Bottom line: I'll try Ring 5 whitening shampoo next time."
5,Worlds best birding binoculars,"These binoculars are the standard to judge all other binoculars. European binoculars at 2 to 3 times the price of these Nikons CANNOT compare! Everyone who has the opportunity to look through these Nikon Premier SE (sometimes called Superior ""E"")binoculars always respond....WOW! You can look through these all day without any kind of discomfort or eye strain. They are very light to hang around your neck and handle/focus quickly. Truly a remarkable binocular and an excellent buy thru Amazon!!"
4,Pricey but beats having to buy the whole thing again,"The eclipse sunshades are excellent. We have one on our Miata convertible. No muss, no fuss just a quick pull and your dash is protected. Only reason we needed these is because we had the windshield replaced and just couldn't get any kind of glue to hold more than a month by reusing the old ones. $15 seemed high for a few little pieces of plastic, but at least they don't make you buy the whole thing again. Good product and shipping was on time."
5,Excellent workout video,"I loved it!! Spinning is a mental physical complete program.This is a climb workout between 7 and 9 level, but you can always work it at your own level. If you are wearing a heart rate monitor it means working between 70% and 90%. Most of the time you work between 70 and 80%.The instructor keeps motivating you and checking form: mind, posture, breathing as well as cadence. Includes:6 minutes of warm up10 min Seated flat running4 min. Standing climb2 min. Seated climb7 min. Transition climbing (seated then standing,every 1 or 1 and a half minutes)10 min Transition climbing (combining seated and standing, you choose)6 min Recovery3 min cool down and stretchI love when he says: Smile, you know you're going to change your body. Your're going to look amazing!!!!"
3,Okay movie,"Spoiler alert!The trailer advertises this movie to have a plot where superman goes ""bad"".That was the reason I rented to watch it. But it was just a trick superman thought up to teach the world a lesson, which is retarded."
4,"Surprisingly good, not what you would expect","This is a great cartoon-movie...I ignored it for months, and then all of a sudden decided to give it a chance after watching the trailer. It's not what you would expect with Superman, but it was good. I liked the movie a lot, and you will enjoy the animation, the humor, the action, the story, etc. I am not saying this is the best, but I am saying that you should enjoy this movie if you give it a chance."
2,crap,"Was I watching a superman cartoon or an episode of 24? Debating lethal force for terrorists? Completely not what a typical dc fan would want. Horrible animation, looks like some art class project. Any episode of JLU was infinitely better."
2,GREAT STORY RUINED BY AWFUL ART,"The story open with a cool retro-pop-art credit sequence using images from the Super-friends cartoon. Then its followed by a mock kiddie Superman cartoon done in a very cartoony style. I thought ""Wow, very creative!""...Then the actual story starts... and the art is awful. Not just awful - amateurish. Superman's face is often mis-shapen - not in any creative way - it looks just sloppily drawn. The ironic is that this is probably one of the most adult and well written scripts in the DC Universe animated films.I'd recommend renting it and not buying it."
5,the best of dc comics animated features,This is one of the best stories i have ever seen with superman. A new team of heros called the elite shows up to help superman whlie he is stopping an army from destroying a town. but their methods of dealing with the bad guys has everyone liking them and has everyone wondering is supermans ways are still relevent in todays world. What i like about this movie is that it had even superman thinking about his own ways and morols. I do not want to giv away the movie because it is really really worth buying even if you do not buy it at least rent it. Do not pay any attention to the 3 star reviews this movie is really worth seeing.This movie is 74 minutes long NOT 58 minutes long
3,More villianous details *SPOILER*,"I thought this was a decent movie, however, I had 2 major problems.First, I wanted more information on the villains. We all pretty much know what's going on with Supes, how about where does that conjuring dude get his dragons from, etc. The voices were well done, but pretty much there were only 2 characters featured. An expanded role would have been more interesting imo.The ending was pretty ""Super Friends-ish"" What I mean by that is, it was kinda goofy to have 20 superbots to help superman defeat the villains. I suppose he could use the bots for any and all villians. Why not install thousands of superbots and just control them from a command center and retire?"
3,It's ok but not great,This is a good movie if you like these comic book movies you cant go wrong with this. My only suggestion for this blu ray would be I wish it had better and more special features because it seemed like they only went half way with them.
2,Good story ruined by horrible animation,"Beware, this is a good story, but the animation is so stylized and choppy it makes it almost unwatchable. I was tempted to watch with my eyes closed. The story and voice direction are strong, but when you see the characters and the action, it really makes you cringe. I wish I would have rented this first. This is the first DC movies I have regrets in buying and will make me preview now before buying."
4,"Blu-ray Review: ""Superman Vs. The Elite""","Marvel might rule the live-action comic book movie arena, but when it comes to direct-to-DVD animated action DC takes the trophy. They consistently pump out great versions of different story arcs comic book fans have wanted to see in motion for decades. DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Premiere bring us the latest animated addition to their movie collection with ""Superman vs. The Elite.""The ""Superman vs. The Elite"" two-disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack provides an entertaining feature film and all sorts of great bonus material. Although it might not be the animation or voice cast fans have grown accustomed to, as a whole package it's well worth your hard earned cash. The PG-13 rating on the film should be taken seriously. There's quite a bit of language and some intense violence and moments in it."
4,"SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST SUPERMAN ENTRY, BUT...","I had a lot of hope for this one. George Newbern (along with Tim Daly) are the best Supermans since Christopher Reeves. The story was very well adapted and has been noted, very timely.However...why was it necessary to draw Clark as if he had just stepped out of a page from a MAD Magazine parody?In a story line where Clark's ideals, methods, and credibility are being questioned, Clark needed to be taken seriously. It is very difficult to take ANYONE seriously who looks like the Tick! This was a very inapproriate artistic choice on someone's part. (Also it is difficult to hide that jaw behind a pair of glasses!)All in all...4 stars for the story and voice work. 2 stars for the character design and animation."
3,"Great story, Cheap Art Direction",I like the story...The Animation is a bit cheap for a full length film though.I think they would have been better off with a more progressive or adult style.
3,not bad.,Best supeman DVD ever? hardly. However it does more than enough to be worth watching. I could do without the style of animation but i have seen worse. Where this suffers is that the story is overly cliched; even for an animated movie. The people as well as the hero flirts with the darside only to come back at the end. I haven't been a comic book reader in a really long time but I am sure there are better superman stories to tell than this one.
1,A rotten story,"I would love to review this movie, but I was so bored I kept falling asleep. Somewhere about half way through I had sense enough to shut it off and watch TV."
2,Super dud,"Don't let your youngsters watch! The violence is mean spirited, the language is not your normal comic book banter, and the story, . . .if you want to call it that, goes no where. Through the whole torturous event I kept hoping another masked crusader would come to the aide of Superman, if only to save him from this dragging dialog. My son, who loves this stuff was asleep before the first action scenes. Which was lucky, since the antagonist decided to start spewing his unnecessary expletives as soon as the violence ramped up. There is a feel to comics, when they leap from page to screen, or from mental concept to visual experience. Unfortunately, this film never even came close, starting with the hard edged art work. Marvel should fly back to Planet Hulk, and recharge some of its lost style."
3,Skeptical fan...,The trailer is promising if you can look past Superman's Jay Leno sized chin. Plus only 58 minutes in length???? What gives?
3,PLEASE NEW CHARACTERS !!!,"GOOD STORY MAKES SUPERMAN STANDS OUT EVEN OKAY, BUT CAN'T WONDERING ABOUT THE OTHER SUPER HEROES AQUAMAN , JON STEWART WHAT EVER HAPPEN TO HIM? HE WAS ON THE SCENE THEN WHAM BAM GONE. COME ON LETS NOT FORGET THE HEROES PLEASE!!!!!!"
2,Destruction Elite,The movie wasn't horrible but I got the message about Superman not killing villains etc.It may seem petty but the unneeded wanton destruction of property in this movie irked me a little. At minimum 500 million dollars of damage to public property that was completely avoidable.The artwork for this movie was a bit sophomoric or should have been left for a Dora the explorer series.
1,This book is the Assignments edition.,This book is a supplement to the textbook. It doesn't say it is the Assignments version on your website. You really should add that into the title.
5,As intense as literature gets.,"For brutality, intensity and stomach pulling honesty the rest of the world just wishes it could match Bill Shields. Huddle in bed with this book and thank creation that your worst nightmares don't come close to his reality. S-E A BoTD is Shields at his Vietnam induced best."
5,The Real Thing,"Shields' book takes you to places most readers and writers don't want to travel to: the elephant grass deep within our unconscious, where all the horror lurks, unseen. Also, Cunis' cover is utterly striking, a graphic metaphor for the terror within."
5,"What were you listening too, Dionne shines!","I not sure what the other reviewers are doing, but I really love this effort. I in no means think that Dionne adds anything new to the songs of Cole Porter. But Dionne Warwick is in my mind the greatest pop singer of the last 4 decades. Dionne's artistry is at it's highest here; she sings with effortfully strong vocals sets. Her voice is as beautiful ever, perfect phasing, skillful effortful. I have purchased several copies of this cd( car, work, home gifts). If one is looking for a new versions of old classics then no don't buy this effort. But if you want to see a classic vocalist, singing classic songs by classic writer then do not hesitate...I don't think you will be disappointed!!!"
4,"Nothing groundbreaking, but enchanting nonetheless","This album was recorded in 1990, by which time all the years of smoking had clearly taken their toll on Dionne's once enviable vocal range. The musical arrangements here are pretty generic as others have mentioned, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as songs this good basically carry themselves with at least decent instrumentation (and there is plenty of orchestration on this record, even if it is a bit uninspired). Dionne's voice does sound a bit worn and tired throughout, but at the same time retains a rich quality and sophistication that make this album a very pleasant listen from start to finish."
2,Mediocre to poor Cole Porter renditions,"The better songs on this collection are, at best, mediocre. The lesser ones are truly poor. The production sounds much too slick, synthesized, and contrived. I'm not sure why Ms. Warwick decided to take this too often travelled road of covering Cole Porter."
1,Embrassingly Bad!,"This must be one of the worst albums of all times. It truly makes some of Nancy Wilson's Japanese market recordings from the 80's look positively artistic. The Oompah-pah orchestrations make the Cole Porter tunes sound like German polkas. As for Dionne's ""interpretations"", she sings Cole Porter as she has never ever heard these songs before. Not only does she lack any feeling for singing Broadway tunes, but her delivery is shockingly bad. She sings these songs as if she doesn't understand English, and is simply phoneticizing a foreign tongue. Her version of ""I got you under my skin"" is destined to be a cult classic. She has obviously never heard this song before, and her delivery is so horrible, that it made me laugh out loud. Only buy this CD if you really enjoy truly trashy music."
5,WGC keep delivering.,"What a pleasure it has been to follow the progress of Willard Grant Conspiracy from the promising beginnings of their first record 'Flying Low', to see that promise delivered on '99's 'Mojave' to this, their latest and most fully formed album 'Everything's Fine'. Put simply, 'Everthing's Fine' is a glorious collection of songs which will have you hooked from the first play. The dynamics are the same, Robert Fisher's deep soulful voice over WGC's trademark lulling, melancholy guitars, however the sound is warmer and on songs such as 'Christmas In Nevada' and the soaring 'Kite Flying' you feel the undeniable pull of all the elements coming together to create this unique and poignant gem. Again, this is a pleasure to own."
4,A Perfect Blend of all Likes of Perfection,"This is one of the greatest unheard of bands. Although this is not the best albulm the guys have produced it is definatley worth your money. Imagine yourself up in the mountains, during a heavy snowstorm, circled around the fire playing cards and drinking with your best buddies and girlfriends."
3,Trapped... weird book,"This is a strange and demented book that will make you wonder how these stories might have come about. You have nothing to worry about if you read this book because after each short story is an author's note about why they wrote their story. The stories are about how a human can feel trapped in a cetain siuation, may it be mentally, or physically. The author of the story has something to relate to their work in their note. The psycological ways of our minds is unveiled in Trapped!. The uncomprehensible human mind is manipulated and isolated in words to show our fear and apprehension. If you read it, you might learn the ways of nature, and how humans react in a situation when they are TRAPPED!"
1,Intertape Pro Blue Masking Tape,"I was so excited to get this tape. I have been looking for a long time for a tape that would stick, not let the paint bleed through, and that would come off clean. Well, that didn't happen. The tape does stick good. As a matter of fact, it sticks so good that it took the finish off of my wood trim when I removed the tape, and it had only been on one day. The paint also bled through in spots. I made sure that I ran my fingers over the edge I needed sealed, it was firmly stuck in place before I painted. I will not be using the rest of this roll, I am very disappointed in it's performance. The tape caused more work instead of helping with my paint project."
4,"Good enough, but not as fine as Scotch","I have used Scotch blue tape for years, but I felt it was expensive until I saw the price of this tape! It sticks well, but is thicker, denser, harder to tear, and more expensive than the Scotch blue tape I buy at Home Depot."
3,"Nice tape, but too pricey","This tape works really well. It sticks well, but comes off easy too. Very useful for painting, and seems strong enough to use in a few places where I would normally use duct tape, although it is not as permanent.But it costs a lot for doing those kinds of odd jobs. The cheaper stuff works well enough for me.Also, I can't figure out where they get the 1.88-inch width from. Why 1.88 inches? That's 4.77 centimeters, so it's not because it's an even metric measure. Strange."
2,"Over-priced, so-so tape","I was not impressed by this tape. I would compare it to generic home store brand tape. In comparison, I prefer the original 3M Scotch brand. Performance-wise, I would give it 3 stars, however considering it is more expensive than the Scotch brand which I think performs better, I knock it down to 2 stars. For general-purpose work, I prefer Scotch, which I would give 4 stars, and if I'm really worried about performance and a tight seal/bleeding, I would use Frog tape which I think is also cheaper (depending on where you buy it)."
3,Maybe not for artwork,"I used the Intertape 91400 Pro Blue Masking Tape for my art work, something I use masking tape for quite often. I put it on a few different canvas paintings I was working on, did some painting, and did'nt get back to them for a couple weeks. Just like in the product desciption, it removed cleanly even after 14 days. No gummy residue and didn't pull up any of the paint it was over. I was really happy with that. I was disappointed that it didn't leave a clean line, at points the paint bled under the tape. I know that canvas is not a perfectly flat surface, but I have had cleaner lines on it with other tapes."
4,Reasonably Decent Masking Tape,"As an amateur, I only occasionally use masking tape. For years I used the beige garbage that only marginally worked. Now I have been using the ""green"" (from another company) tape, and it works very well. This tape has medium adhesion, maybe a bit on the light side, but it works reasonably well (as in the title of this review). The tape seems a bit thin, but it doesn't snap or tear all that easily (in fact, you really need scissors to cut it right, doing it by hand is an off/on experience). It does come off relatively easily if you get to it in a day or two. I don't know how it would be if left on for weeks. In sum it works satisfactorily, and it is not overly expensive. I hope this helps."
3,Overpriced for average masking tape,"This tape worked moderately well. In fact I could not tell the difference between this tape and tape at half it's price! It tore unevenly just like most masking tape. It was hard to get off where it had been pressed into corners and then painted over, just as most other tape. I will say that I did not notice any bleed through but that has rarely been a problem with others as long as I took the time to press it down good. All in all I found it to be adequate masking tape for the job but not worth the extra money being asked for it."
4,.a delightful combination of silver and stars.,"If you're looking for a ""perfectly"" crafted ring, skip this one. The shape of the stars varies and upon close inspection, the band has a few flaws.However, if you're looking for a fun ring to add a little sparkle to your hand... then this ring won't disappoint. I appreciate the slight flaws found in this darling ring, as I immediately fell in love with it the moment I placed it on my finger. If it wasn't for the slight flaws, I would have given it 5 stars. This ring is absolutely darling.Update: 3.10.11The ring I wrote this review for is no longer showing on this page. It used to be a silver ring with stars that had czs in the middle of them. I don't understand why this company didn't make a new listing for the marcasite ring that is currently showing."
5,Torn,"I'm truly impressed with LeToya's vocals after years of being overshadowed by Beyonce & Kelly Rowland. After all the turmoil Destiny's Child with through it's truly great they did break up. Otherwise her true talent would never been known. This is an amazing slow jam for any music lover. I just can't wait for the release of her debut album ""LeToya""."
3,Acceptable,"This song, Torn, really doesnt showcase any vocal skills. The range shown in this song is very limited, and after that bleak performance on 106& Park, it becomes very obvious why LeToya was ""Torn"" from the group. She definitley has a back-up singers voice, but definitley not lead. You can hear the Destiny's Child, in her singing, with her short and unfavorable runs, but her vibrato is something more appeasing to the ear. Miss Luckett was not overshadowed by Beyonce nor Kelly, she just didnt have the vocal capability, Can she Keep Up, Baby Girl but Beyonce and Kelly, made her loose her breath. Hopefully, this album will show more of her supposed skills, but in the event that it falls short, Torn will be a fitting titlt to more than just love."
4,it is ok!,"I like to mix them with tea and tastes ok, I just wish the smell was stronger to use them for a relaxing bath. They are very mild in flavor"
2,Not 1971's Best,"Rock On's 1971 collection hardly offers the best of 1971. Of course they have to include one of the year's biggest hits, the overplayed ""Joy To The World"" by Three Dog Night, but do you really need another Three Dog Night song, the cheesy ""Old Fashioned Love Song"" also. You get second rate songs by BJ Thomas, The 5th Dimension, an awful version of ""Woodstock"" by England's Matthews Southern Comfort and a brutal cover of ""Stagger Lee"" by Tommy Roe. Amid the clutter are some good songs including the Chi-Lites silky smooth ""Have You Seen Her"", Brewer & Shipley's catchy ""One Toke Over The Line"" and Hamilton, Joe & Frank's Elvis Presleyesque ""Don't Pull Your Love""."
3,Good Movie. But Jonathan Frid deserved lines!,"I really liked this movie, no gore just lots of eerie atmosphiric tension throughout. But Jonathan Frid deserved a role that had some lines! And not just as a mute Chauffer/Boy toy for Miss Shelley Winters. I mean, he carried Dark Shadows for 4 years and was always so great at compassionately killing off people. But Shelley Winters is fun to watch as Lilith, in my opinion. And Joseph Cotton is always good in anything with a horror/suspence element."
5,Disappointed,"The product ws not available. It had been put on back-order several times. Finally, a Pentax Optio M30 had to be ordered in its place, which ran approximately $100.00 more."
3,it's o.k.,"I liked how the camera looks and all the little things with it but for a 7.0 megapixel camera it sure is taking grainy pictures, trying to find out how to stop that but it seems hopeless. my half broken sony cybershot takes better quality photos! ah well.still a nice camera though."
4,Well done live recording,"""Greatest Hits Live"" is an exceptionally well-done live album. Carly Simon used to be afflicted by stage fright in the early years of her career, but there is no sign of that in her confident renderings of her best-known songs. Her performances are energetic and yet nuanced. She never misses a beat.I'd actually like to give this album 4.5 stars if I could. The only thing that keeps it from being five stars is questionable mixing on a couple of tracks, especially the opener, ""Nobody Does It Better."" Simon's vocals are mixed real low in that track, but the production improves throughout the rest of the program.Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
1,YET NO RECEPT MY PRODUCT,Aún no he recibido mi producto. Espero que no tarde más.SALUDOS.Carly Simon - Greatest Hits Live(Yet not recept my product. I Wait that no late moore.)
5,Carly is awesome!!!!,"Carly Simon - Greatest Hits AWESOME!Carly Simon - Live AWESOME!!!Carly Simon - Greatest Hits Live - BEYOND AWESOME!!!!Carly is a great singer, this CD is 100 stars!!"
2,You're So lame,"For openers, she is not in great voice and needs all the cover that her background singers can provide. The band are in good form although the drums are a bit too loud in the mix.Carly has little to say to her adoring fans between tunes except for an occasional ""Thank You"". Ms Personality, she ain't.My biggest complaint about this album is that it sounds totally rehearsed and completely not spontaneous. If you like the original studio versions, then you'll love these cuts since they are almost all identical. I kept wishing the itsy bitsy spider would have crawled up her leg at some point and burrow in. That might have given this boring performance a bit of life."
1,Unscientific nonsense,"If there's an answer (and there may not be an answer) then Kuhn hasn't found it. Postmodernistists who do not know science but who like to 'criticize' science often cite this book. Have they understood it? I haven't, because the argument makes no sense. I do understand physics, which does. Kuhn was not really a working scientist, and cannot describe what scientists do (see, however, the beautiful essays on creativity by Einstein, Hadamaard, and Poincare). Consider the following: a successlul speculator cannot even explain sensibly how he makes money (witness Soros's book ""The Alchemy of Finance""). How can a nonscientist, or even a scientist, be expected account 'systematically' for the wonder of scientific discovery?"
1,pass,"I'm sorry, but it seems to me illogical, inconsistent, and hypocritical to say in the same breath that this book is good because it has been ""influential"" and yet it is not to be blamed for ""New Age fuzzies usurping [its] terminology"". Either it should be judged for its influence or it shouldn't. I say it shouldn't, but YOU have to say one way or the other; you can't have it BOTH ways.We are also admonished to make allowances for its age: ""You had to be there."" Possibly, but it seems to me after a certain elapsed time, you can pretty much get away with saying this about anything.As it happens, I am not at all impressed by this book's content. Its ideas seem to me stale, simple-minded, and just plain wrong-headed. That isn't why I've given it one star only though. I've given it one star only because it is very, very, very clumsily written. I don't care who the author is or what he has to say; if he can't write, he shouldn't be published."
5,"Read it, or suffer the consequences.","Kuhn's work may be thick reading for a mind thin on science, like mine, but until you've read it, you're in the dark. Science is not what you thought it was; Kuhn tells it as it is. Read it and reap"
2,"Important, but Over-rated","The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is an important book, because it helped people view scientific progress in a new light, and introduced us to the important concept of paradigm shift. Unfortunately, however, the book is poorly written, with a dense and overly academic style, and quite frankly, is very, very, boring. Good concept, poor execution."
2,read the postscript first,This book was assigned for a history of science course I took in college. I would suggest reading the postscript before you read the book. It makes it a lot easier to understand Kuhn's argument.
4,A long but worthwhile read,"To be honest this was probably one of the most chalenging books that I have read. From what I understand this was the authors first book and it trully shows, especially when one compares the writing style of the main text with the postscript (which was writen seven years later). Frankly during some parts of the book it was a chore to conintue to reading. But considering what the book it lacking I would still say that it is a must read for any science majors, and I would recomend it to anyone who is interested in how science grows and evolves overtime.Kuhn lays out what is required for a scientific revolution to take place and how the proceses happens. His thoughts also put into prespective modern changes in the scientific comunity's accepted believes. While it does take considerable effort to get throught the book I am glad the I read it."
3,Not for the faint of hearts ...,"I am reading this book as a requirement for my PhD. The language is very dense, for a plebeian I had to re-read many pages (and sometimes chapters) for a second and on some occasion third times. For the #brainfood the book delivered, this was definitely an over-investment in my time and eyesight. I would recommend reading an abridged version (if one exists).-Richie"
