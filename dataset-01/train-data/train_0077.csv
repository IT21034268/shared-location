5,Que Bella,"This book is so beautiful. Most of Hmeingway's books are ""macho"" and kind of get boring with all the blood , gore, and masculinity. This story was different. Although it has aspects of adventure, it really was more a story of overcoming odds, and doing something you set out to do. At the end, even though his fish gets eaten by sharks, he at least knows that he did it, and could do it again. I wonder if the lions he dreams about stand for his hopes and dreams. At the end, he still dreams about the lions. He hasn't given up hope. Claire, age 15, read this for a school project and because I love to read."
5,Great Book,"Somebody read me The Old Man and the Sea. It was the most riveting novel I have read or heard in a very long time. Hemmingways referalls to ""The great Dimaggio"" touched me on how baseball was interwoven in a battle for a fish and eventual destruction of Santiago's prize"
4,"A Hard To Grasp Book, but Worth The Read.","At first, I thought this was the most boring book I had ever read. I knew there had to be some more to it because no one writes a book about a big fish and then it is destroyed. After have a long discussion with a friend, I relized Hemingway used the bible as his background. I couldn't exactly tell you how, but it ties in with God. If you read, you see that the old man's hands get hurt & bleed, just as if they were nailed to a cross. I think the old man represented Christ. I'm not really sure what exactly the fish was, but as you notice the sharks keep eating the fish away. It now makes much more sense. I am sure when I return to school, my teacher will give a full explination. I would recommed you think the book over before you give such harsh judgement. He didn't win the Nobel Prize for an awful book!"
3,"A decent story: compelling, yet not quite what I expected","Well...here I am, 14 years old, and I had to read this book for English. When I picked up this book, and found it to be written by Hemingway, I expected it be a superlative masterpiece of fiction, as is usually the wont of a renown author. However, this book disappointed me to some extent. The story itself was quite good, beautifully portraying one of life's great struggles in the form of an old fisherman's struggle with a marlin. But, the style in which the book was written was what really disappointed. I expected a fantastic, descriptive style, yet found a simplistic, and almost annoyingly abrupt one. The story was great, as well as the meaning, but the means by which it was conveyed was not altogether pleasing to me..."
4,a real thought provoker,"My essay on this book for AP English is due tomorow, and so I came to look for some inspiration, the prompt being whether the Old Man failed or suceeded. Though I am still undecided, I'm inclined to think he came out triumphant, many of the rave reviews on here making up my mind. Santiago did leave me pondering the barriers I could break if I put only half as much dedication to my goals as hid to his, however the messege well taken, I still had to muster up alot of dedication to get to the last page. His struggle left me struggling to continue reading, since it just got repetitive after a while."
5,A little gem,"This is a beautiful little book. It is my first taste of Hemingway and was a pleasing surprise. It is the simple story of an 85 year old fisherman. He has lost his luck, his young helper and his respect. He goes out to sea, alone, and encounters a huge Marlin. The rest of the story is about what happens. The language is economical and clear. The developing relationship between the old man and the great fish is gripping. The ending sends shivers down the spine.It has been said that Ernest Hemingway is at his best with short stories. This is more of a novella but a great example of concise writing. I would not normally be drawn to a story about a man and a fish but am so glad that I did not miss this one."
5,A classic novel from a classic writer,"Ernest Hemingway is not considered one of the greatest American writers without merit. A recommended beach/vacation read for the upcoming summer! I enjoyed reading it near the ocean. The book's setting and the beach are a great combination! I've read the work several times and it leaves an impression with each reading. If you're hesitant about purchasing The Old Man and the Sea, I would suggest placing your reservations aside.Enjoy fellow readers!JR"
5,A Timeless Classic,"I remember watching this movie when I was a little boy and it made me so sad that I cried. When I read Hemingway's masterpiece, I was transported back to my childhood and my love for this story."
5,Engaging Classic,"I haven't read classics since school and decided to take a break from commercial and contemporary fiction to read a few. I'm quite surprised that a story about a fish could have me wrapped up and engaged. This was my first Hemingway book and I enjoyed his simple storytelling style. Because it was straight forward, I was able to get into the old man's dilemma of not having caught a fish in months and then battling with this great marlin, only to have it attacked by sharks. I like that I was able to get into and feel his struggles within his mind and against his body. This was a very engaging classic."
2,I wanted it over,I am on a Hemingway kick and this was the only one of his which I simply did not like. It's short but it seemed so darn long. Fish or cut bait already.His Nobel prize was deserved for his career but NOT for this book!
4,The Old Struggle,"The Old Man and the Sea is the classic tale of a man's struggle against the one obstacle which never seems to take care of itself: the pursuit of happiness. In the novel, we are taken through a three day journey with an old man named Santiago as he tries to capture a fish for the first time in 83 days. The novel shoes excellent symbolism, along with Santiago's struggles with himself, and the fish he has hooked. The Old Man and the Sea is a quick easy read, and although some might not enjoy it, the novel present itself as a classic, and turns out to be close to that."
4,The Old Man and The Sea,"Santiago is an old man who loves to fish. He dreams about catching a large fish and returning to his former days of glory.He goes out one day to fish and catches a large marlin. The long struggle between the man and marlin begins. After a long time at sea, sharks eat most of the marlin. The old man is left with only its carcass and returns to shore.I throughly enjoyed this novel. I felt Hemmingway's personification of the sea was a nice touch that made the book even better. You also couldn't help but like Santiago. His hard work and sacrifice was noble and he kept his humility throughout the book. Well, I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about the struggles we all have or will face, and the effort that one put forth to achieve his goal."
3,A Review of Old Man and the Sea,"I thought this book was interesting, but slow. I really like Hemingway's style of writing, using short declaritive sentences. I do have one complaint, this book could have been written in about 20 pages. It takes this man 100 pages to catch the 18 foot marlin. I thought the old man was crazy because he had an unusual habit of talking to himself. As I said though it's very slow I had trouble getting into the book. It also lacked a true climax."
4,The Old Man and the Sea,The Old man and the sea is a great book about a man who just lost the swing of things. All over his hands are the scars of fishing wires dug into his skin by enormus fish but none of which are fresh. He hasn't caught a fish in a good long time but there is still a boy who has faith in him. Eventually he does get the swing of things back and it is a great story to see how. I highly recomend this book to anyone who questions the power of faith. Judging from this book i would definetely check out more books from Ernest Hemingway.
4,The Old Man and the Sea,"The book is about an old man named Santiago who has been on a fishing slump for 84 days. Since, he hasn't caught any fish he is very poor, and all the people in town make fun of him except his trusted friend Manolin. Santiago then goes out to sea and goes on the journey of his life. I would recommend you to go and read this book and see what happens."
1,disappointed,"this book was really, incredibly horrible. it was horrid, even. it was by far the worst book i've ever had the disgust in reading. i hated this book with a passion. i recommend it to no one. you will be disappointed. after all the awards it has recieved, you'd think it would have been better."
2,I rate The Old Man and The Sea 2 stars.,"An old man and his friend are fisherman. Without any luck for so long, Santiago catches a fish. He likes to be alone and talks to himself. I wound not recommend this book to anyone. It is very boring. The part I hated the most was when he was out to sea. I am not finished with this book, but my mind probably want change about it."
1,Terrible worst book ever!!,"This book is terrible. It has no main point, confusing, irritating, and stupid. Don't read this weird book, trust me. Ernest doesn't deseve a nobel prize. Listen to me OK?! What is this book, it is so crazy and I wont even call it a book. This book is nothing!"
3,Old Man and the Sea is a book to appreciate,"Actually, i am one of the few people that found this book to be not so good or not so great, but its a great classic. I found it a bit dry at times, like when he was trying to catch that marlin and spent 2+ days following that stupid fish. It didnt have much action in it, and it was very short. It took me about 2 1/2 hours total to read it. Yet his person vs. nature is very interesting. I dont know why this book is so popular still today, but it is a pretty good book. I dont know, maybe i'll appreciate it more when i get older."
5,A story with meaning,"This is my second favorite Hemingway book. The first being For Whom the Bell Tolls. However, this classic is timeless and crafty in that, its written just right. It's a book about life an its certain aspects that I will not mention to save the story for those of you that haven't read it. If you read the book and only notice the fish, then you've missed the point. Those of you who are intelligent, will not only enjoy the story for its double-plot, but love it for what it is."
3,new to hemingway ? - this is a good place to start ...,"if you are new to hemingway and would like something simple to get you started, this is as good a place as any. this short novella characterizes hemingway's sharp descript style. The Old Man And The Sea romantically tells the tale of a <you guessed it> old fisherman and his coming to terms with many issues. The old man sets to sea without the aid of his young friend and junior fisherman. once deep at sea, the old man hooks into a large fish, unlike any he's known. the story begins ..at 127 pages this is a quick read and worth the time invested."
3,Excellent Use of Symbolism,Hemmingway demonstrates excellent use of symbolism. Strong links between Santiago and Jesus are evident. This book demonstrates great depth and character development. I highly reccomend this book.
3,Good and Bad,"In my opinion, this book is just flat out boring, but i can see why it won an award. It just tells a story of a group of fisherman who live off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, somewhere in Cuba. it gives a perspective on how poor people are in some places and how poor people can be. i gave it three stars becaues half the people that read it will like it and half the people that read it will hate it. i dont care if you dissagree with this review, infact i think its awesome if you do because it sheds a light on how different people are. NRG"
2,Ha ha,"I respect Hemmingway in the fact that he was a very good writer, but I just didn't like this book. The plot was very boring, and all of the ""deep insights"" the book suposidly had ment nothing to me. I think reading it was an utter waste of time."
3,For Mrs. M's English class,"The old man at the sea is an extremely boring and deep book. Looking at in general it is not exciting book and it lacks a real plot that makes a person really want follow the book with out putting it down. In that sense i did not enjoy the book , because i like exciting books filled with happening stuff. On a deeper level Santiago is represented as a courageous man who is determined to catch the fish. What i liked is his determination and his strong belief that keeps him going.we all can take an example of his courageousness."
2,"If you can make it past the first 50 pages, you'll be okay","I must've (literally) fallen asleep at least five times before making it through the first 50 pages... the beginning is hard to get into, and basically a total drag... once you get past that, however, it gets more interesting (although, by that time, you're halfway through the book). The end is incredibly disappointing, but has a lot of meaning to it. The entire book is filled with hidden meanings and allusions, but some are hard to catch. Overall, an okay book, but I certainly wouldn't label it as a classic."
3,It was an average book but it gets better,I thought the book was average because it was slow going. if you ever come across it you will problably stop after the first 30 pages but keep on going because it gets better. The time when he got attacked by sharks and waited 5 hours for this huge fish. SO READ THE BOOK AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED.
3,THis book is oke dokey,this book is an ok book if you like to read about an old mans life then i would read this book. i look at the book as a dull book because all it talks about the life of an old man and how much he likes to fish. that does not sound like that much fun if all that he does for his free time. i could go to the river and watch someone fish and that would be a lot more fun then sitting down and reading about it. if you want to read it then go ahead but that is all i have to say about that.
2,I did not like it,"I agree that children who hate reading and doing book reports should not post their reviews on Amazon, because the kids are going to hate reading it anyway since it is an assignment. As an 18 year old book lover, I thought I would give this book a try. Nobody forced me to read it, I read it for my own enjoyment. I just did not find this book interesting. I kept thinking..Santiago, let that fish go and row back to shore. Was it really worth all that trouble? I gave this book two stars because the book had one or two genuine moments in it that inspired me, but I did not care for the story as a whole. The book left me disappointed, so I started reading ""A Brave New World"". It is a much better book, in my opinion."
2,A fisherman tries to catch a very big fish.,I think this book is not for young people to read. It will become a borring book for them. Hemingway is a very good writer. In this book he makes the story too long.
3,I actually didn't like it,"I did not think that the Old Man and the Sea was any good. I thought the text was too babyish and it seemed as though everything was just thrown together. DON""T READ IT!! IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!!!"
2,It's boring,"First of all, I wouldn't recommend buying this edition of the book because they couldn't even spell the author's name correctly.Regarding the book itself, I remember dragging myself through the pages as a high school freshman and asking myself why I had to end up with the only teacher who chose The Old Man and the Sea over Of Mice and Men. I recognized the metaphors about life, but I didn't care because the story just wasn't engaging. Eat raw dolphin, pee over the side of the boat, pull the fish. Rinse and repeat.I thought maybe re-reading it as an adult might change my perspective, but no. It's still boring. I didn't even finish it this time. I don't care what deeper message the story contains, I'm not going to read it if I have to fight to stay awake. If you want to read a good book by Ernest Hemingway, try A Farewell to Arms."
2,Copy Received Not as Pictured,"I know this will be a great story, but annoyed that the copy I got does not have the correct cover. The copy received is some sort of re-make cover that is black and yellow. I was hoping for the blue/white cover with the sea pictured as this item will be going into a fisherman's library. I'll probably have to buy again somewhere in-person to make sure I am getting correct cover."
4,"Well written, lacked action","The Old Man and the Sea was extremely well written. It drew you into the story in short yet powerful sentences. However, it was not something that I couldn't put down. The whole battle with the marlin lasted too long and made me sleepy.."
2,For grammar lovers,"Hemingway... Fish... Personally, when I read this book, I felt a bit seasick. I love novels of colors and flavors, novels with variety and awkward sentences. The Old Man and the Sea would certainly get an 800 on the SAT II, but, well, Shakespeare would've barely gotten the 200 for his name. Still not comprehending? Once upon a time, in all of our lives, we have had to take a course titled ""grammar."" If you enjoy simple sentences that get the point across quickly and bluntly, this book will by far exceed your greatest expectations. Hemingway is for the impatient readers. However, if you, like myself, love writing that is more poetic than 8th-grade-english-class, I would highly recommend reading a brief summary of the book and getting on with life."
4,One of Hemingway's best Novels,"The Old Man and The Sea was a good book all in all. Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is very detailed, you would know that if you read some of his other books.The book starts off talking about the old man named Santiago, and how he hasn't cought a fish in 84-days, but one day when he goes out to fish, he ends up catching a giant marlin that starts dragging him out to sea. I don't want to give the rest of the story away, so I'm not going to tell you anything more about this book. I can tell you this is one of Hemingway's best books that I've read."
4,Old Man and the Sea,"Old Man and the Sea tells the will power of an old man battling the sea. This book was so well written. I felt as if I were in the book. Santiago, the old man, was described as an old, rugged, Cuban fisherman. I felt like I knew him from reading the book. The only thing I thought was not as engaging was the beginning. It took a long time to get started. The story tells of an old man and the sea he battles."
2,I'm a sucker,"I was under the impression from the seller's description that the book was in better condition than it actually was/is. I found it interesting that there was a price (from obviously a yard sale or something of that nature) of ""1.50"" written in pencil on the inside cover....congratulations, you made over a $35.00 profit with that sale."
1,not for the average person,"If you are an average Joe looking for a good book to read, this is not for you. I found this book to be repetitive and everything is always linked to something else. It seems to drag on with descriptions and may seem as if it could be written in a few pages. If you are the a literature junky, the type that cannot get enough symbolism and loves to sit around and analyze stories trying to find a hidden meaning this book will delight you, but if you want a book with suspense, mystery and a decent ending stay away."
1,Forget Lullabys... read hemmingway!,"When I found out I had to read this book for school I was actually pretty happy! It only has about 150 pages! but then before I sarted reading it my friend say the book in my poseesion and siad,""That book is the esence of the devil!"" I was like- yea, sure it can't be THAT bad! Boy, was i wrong!! I (usually) am a super- fast reader! a 400 page novel MAY take me 2 days if its good but Old Man and the Sea took me over a month! I put it on my chair in my bedroom and left it there! I would read it at 12 ot night just to make me tired! At least it was good for something! So- unless you can't get yourself to sleep at night- DONT READ THIS BORING BOOK!..."
4,A great writer,"Now I know why he is so admired, great writing skills all about catching one fish. Amazing"
5,My favorite Hemingway short story,This is by far my favorite Ernest Hemingway story. As a fisherman myself I love how Santiago wrestles with the fish and himself through Out. I love the dialog as it goes back and forth with the man and his thoughts while in the boat. I equally like the ending how nothing needs to be said. I do not want to ruin it so I will go no further. Great book.
4,the catch,"This is the story of Santiago, an old man who, like the rest of us, must fill his niche in life. The niche Santiago fills is that of fisherman, a fisherman who has known better days, for he has been out many days without a catch. When he finally does hook into something big, sail along with him as he struggles with getting it into the boat. Some will find this struggle tiring, but if the reader looks at it as a man doing what must be done, he will come away with a lot. It is a story of dignity: that of the fisherman; and respect for life: the spent life of the fish the man catches and then sees debased my scavenger sharks. Hemingway's spare style is obvious in this prize-winning novelette."
3,(YAWN),"Everytime I turned a page of this book I'd go cross-eyed because it's SO BORING! A good book is suppose to make the reader never want the ending to come, but I found myself praying for the last page. I never got sleepy reading a book before, until now. The ending is what finally got me, it didn't end right at all. I mean why the hell did the woman at the end make a comment about a shark's back? IT WAS A MARLIN!!!!! Don't read this book unless there's a literary genious there to translate the deep underlining meaning!"
5,A powerful tale of one man's life at its apex .,"The Old Man and the Sea is a great story told with a simple prose style that carries across the pages like wind.It is the tale of one man, in his own sad world, who carries upon his shoulders the burden of age -- to triumph against the immortal forces of the universe, to have it ripped away, only to learn his own mortality through his conquered prey.This is a tale not so much about the hardship and triumph of marlin fishing, but a tale of an aging champion. It is anything but boring."
3,Different Opinion,"I have mixed feelings about the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"". I feel it has an interesting description of a man catching a fish, but it's hard to believe Ernest Hemmingway could write an entire book about one topic - fishing! If this book was not required for me to read for my English class, I would not have read it. To read Ernest Hemmingway's books, you have to ""read into"" everything, which was challenging at times. For people like me, who do not fish and do not love the hobby, it was hard to keep reading the book."
2,A snoozer!,"Yes, this book has lots of symbolizm. Yes it has universal themes. Yes, Hemingway employs a great use of symbolism. Yes his sentences are short and he uses simple, easy to understand vocabulary. BUT this is one of the most boring books I have ever read!!! Hello! The guy sits in a boat in the middle of the ocean for a hundred pages trying to get a fish. If you love fish or just happen to love any book you read, then you'll love this book. However, I, personally, was not fanscinated. Had the book not been required for my Honors English class summer reading list, I wouldn't have finished it. I gave this books two stars because I realize it had deeper meanings and so forth, plus, thankfully, Hemingway spared us and kept the book fairly short (as opposed to some boring books that are 400 pages) but on a surface level it was an unbearably drawn out book about a fish."
3,An Average Book,"This book, while not particularly enjoyable to read, does raise some interesting questions about man and nature. It paints a picture of one man trying to overcome nature, who loses. The main character Santiago thinks he must kill this fish, even while he thinks that he loves the fish and the ocean it swims in.Santiago is just a drifter, who takes everything as it comes. When he fails, he takes it as a loss and continues blindly through an endless cycle of pain, loss, and weakness.Read the book if you want to look deeper into the meaning of the story, but if you want to read it for the action you'll be disappointed at the slow speed the plot drags along."
2,Nothingness,"The book wasn't too long, in fact, it was incredibly short. And while it is full of symbolism that a person may not catch in the first read, it still wasn't worth it. I'm not a person that hates reading books, in fact, I enjoy it, but when I read this one, it was a struggle to continue reading. I did not find it too enjoyable, and I doubt if any people who do not enjoy reading/fishing/symbolism are going to really want to pick this one up."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I read this book with great expectations. Hemingway has been billed as ""one of the greatest writers of the 20th century""! I figured it must be good, to have so much publicity. I was wrong.The book starts out in Havana, where a poor old man lives. He fishes for a living and has not caught a fish in a while. He knows that he is near the end of his life. He knows a boy who comes over often, but can't fish with him anymore. The old man decides to embark on a fishing trip.Once this happens, the pages drag on. And on. The grammar is supposed to be ""cutting edge"" and ""of powerful simplicity,"" but it's really just incorrect. Call me a stickler, but in the end it's plain annoying.After a hundred pages of time at sea (with not one interesting page), the man returns with no fish. Oh, what great writing? No, just a boring ""novella."""
1,"Mini-""Moby""","Hemingway apes ""Moby Dick,"" recasting Ahab as a ""black sheep"" shaman who constantly yearns for his overly emotional boy slave and has self-destructive tendencies he takes out on his loved ones and those who seek to possess said loved ones. Everything is emptiness, like brainpans fried away, ornaments without luster.At least Idaho Spud keeps his aimless ramblings brief, unlike the constipated ""A Moveable Feast,"" in which Papa Longstocking trained a spotlight on the mundanity of social hour at the writers guild."
1,old man and the sea,I thought this book was pointless and had no meaning to it. All its about is some guy who goes out on a boat and chases a fish around for three days. When he finally returns home he doesnt even have any of the fish left because they got eaten by sharks on the way home. I dont reccomend this book unless you have a book report and want to read a short book.
2,"""The Old Man and The Sea""","While this book was well written as far Hemingway's style is concerned, I fail to comprehend the point of a man trying to catch a fish (which is what the book basically focus's on) If you are looking for an easy fast read, and enjoy the sport of fishing, I would then go on to say yes, read it if you like. But if you want a comprehensive book...this book is NOT for you."
2,A fair story,"When I ordered it I had no idea it was so short (its only about 90 pages).I read this book for school and it wasn't bad, it was a good story, but I felt the book ended to fast, like the writer gave up at in end. ;)"
1,I think this book was very boring!!!,"I'm in 11th grade english right now and we just finished reading this book , and it just made me fall in sleep in class and when I read it on my time I just don't even want to read it, because it is so boring, the begining was o.k but then when he's cut the fish and goes for days ,it just gets boring!!!"
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","I had to read this book for my honors english class and out of all of the books I've ever read, it was the most boring book ever! The constant struggle with the fish and all is not my idea of a good book."
1,Not very impressive,"Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea has been given A LOT of praise since it was written. Given the task of reading a book by an American author for a high school english class, I decided to give it a whirl, with such publicity it must be worth the read, right? After about 50 pages I came to the conclusion that it was one of the most boring books I had ever read. I guess I'm just a sucker for rich detail, which Hemingway completely overlooks. addcaptivating...it was just plain dull. Why the world calls this novella an essential work of American Literature I'll never know."
1,The old man and the sea,I thought the book went on forever and never stopped. I felt like I was reading a book a chid wrote and it dosen't make sense. All it does is talk about a dumb fish and just talks about it for hours
3,Missing Pages,"I wanted a first addition to add to my new library. Well, this book was signed, ""To Jeffrey, 1963""...he never read it. There were four blank pages, and four pages that needed to be sliced open. It left ""blanks"" in the story, got a copy from the local library to finish the story."
5,"throw away your self-help books, it's all right here","call me a throwback, but this slender novel contains more wisdom than entire libraries of self-help books. hemingway tells the story of an old cuban fisherman on his most memorable trip with characteristic simplicity. the man's respect for the fish, courage and inner battle are a fitting finale to hemingway's career. there is more here about character and what life is about than a thousand self-help books.i listened to the audio version and donald sutherland's performance is the best reading i've heard."
2,I didn't get it,"I thought the Old Man and the Sea wasn't very good. I thought the beginning was good and captured my attention, but as the book went on it got very dull. When he was following the fish the imagery was good, but it was boring. I also didn't get the comparison to God. I really don't think that it was intentional of Hemmingway to have Santiago to appear as a Christ-like figure. I think that people just read into the book to far. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I only read it because it was required for my English class."
1,Author's name is SPELLED WRONG ON THE COVER,I wouldn't buy this version. Do yourself a favor and get a version that has the author's name spelled right on the cover. It's Ernest Hemingway. Ernest Hemingway. Ernest Hemingway.This book is a classic.
3,poor,"I hated the book ""The Old Man and the Sea."" It was about the way old fishermen used to fish marlin and it tells of an old fisherman that hooks a huge one and is pulled out to sea by it after it gives up he brings it in with sharks eating it as he goes. The man at the end is sleeping in his bed dreaming of loins. It boread me out of my mind. But it was very well written besides it being atotal bore"
5,Simple yet Gripping,A Book written in a very simple language yet rivets you with the emotions of the Protagonist. Indeed good reading.
5,Superb,"Specific, concrete nouns and adjectives together with detailed human body movements contrast with, yet give visceral support to, the emotions and abstract thoughts."
4,Kept me into it...,"I think that Old Man and the Sea had a decent idea and made it into an interesting story. The way that he would say crazy things made me think, what in the world, but then it followed the crazy thoughts up with him knowing that he said or thought something crazy. His imagination ran wild though. He would talk to the fish and the sea. That allowed me to stay with him by allowing my imagination to picture where he was and the scene. The author did a good job keeping me interested. I like the book, and it's the first novel I've read this year that kept me interested."
4,Good read,The Old Man and The Sea is a short good read. Having only read two Hemingway books I can say it is superior to The Sun Also Rises. I read The Sun Also Rises first and was worried that Hemingway was overrated but this book helped give me reason to continue to other Hemingway works.
2,"""We must kill our brothers""","I really enjoyed the movie (1990) with Anthony Quinn as Santiago. So I decided it was time to read the book. Well I found the book and the movie paralleled pretty well. How ever I was getting bored with the book it seemed a bit repetitive. The old man kept going on and on about Joe Dimaggio's bone spur.There were a few places that made me squeamish. One such place is when he gutted a dolphin and had his face stuck in it.The story is too short to go into detail without revealing the surprises; however it is about (you guessed it) an old fisherman, that should be over the hill, going out to sea from Cuba to catch fish. He has 84 days of bad luck and with any luck this is about to change (or is it?)The reader helps bring the story to life.The Old Man and the Sea ~ Anthony Quinn"
4,Old Man Writes the Sea,"Maybe Hemingway wasn't that old when he wrote ""Man"", but he captures the essence of struggle with all things earthly in the book, particularly as one ages. I read this earlier in my life as a survival tale. It still is, but reads differently from this perspective."
5,An Excellent Novella,This book is about an old man that is out on the sea for 84 days. On the 85 day he cought a huge marlin.Anyway I don't want to give away the book. The book is very detailed and descriptive.I think you should read the book.
3,A Boring Yet Descriptive Novella,"I thought Ernest Hemingway's book The Old Man And The Sea was boring. I think that because he's too descriptive. I mean practically the whole book he describes Santiago's dream of where the yellow, sleek, and mysterious lions walking on the starlit beach after midnight. He also describes gets these huge, aching cramps because of sitting and holding a line on a tan boat put in the middle of the blue and smooth Gulf of Mexico."
1,One of the Worst Books I Have Ever Read,"This was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I was forced to read it in an English assignment. It is 90 percent endless blabber about unnecessary and unwanted detail. Many call this one of the greatest books ever written by Ernest Hemingway. I can say that thanks to this book I will probably never read another Ernest Hemingway novel again. Filled with unending blabber the book is really pointless. There is no lesson to be learned, it is not exciting, funny, dramatic or moving. I would not recommend this book at all, unless you were someone who wanted to waste a few hours of their life. Overall this book never did anything to make me fell that it was a good book."
1,This Book got a Nobel Prize?,"I was forced to read this book in reading class. I found it to be a long book about nothing. Half of the time the book talked the old man's wandering thoughts which had almost nothing to do with the story. And my teacher told us that every thing that happened to Santiago was related to Jesus's crusifiction. I could see that in some areas, but in others it seemed far feched."
3,HUMAN IN THE CONFLECT WITH THE NATURE,"HOW MUCH HAS MAN SPENT IN HIS CONFLECT WITH THE NATURE? , HOW MUCH HE IS POWERFULL,BUT WEAK WHEN FACE HIS GREAT AND TOUGH MOTHER""EARTH"" THAT GIVES IN AHAND AND REGAIN IN THE OTHER THIS IS WHAT JUMP TO MY MIND WHEN I READ THIS VERYGOOD STORY WITH ITS IMPRESSIVE MONOLOGE BUT FOR THE TRUTH THIS MONOLOGE WAS NOT AS DEEP AND PHILOSOPHICAL AS WAS DESCRIBED TO ME BEFOR ,BUT THE STORY IS WORTHY TO READ"
1,It was sooo boring!,"This novella was just plain boring. The many different allegories hidden inside the story is fascinating but I think that for young people, this is NOT the thing to read."
3,Meeker Review,I havent read this one yet so I gave it a 3. I still think it will be good though because Ernest Hemingway is a really good writer.
2,Why didn't he just drown?,"This book is meaningless. It's pointless. It doesn't say anything about society, it doesn't bring up thoughts or opinions, it doesn't take a stand on any issue. It's a story about an old guy in a boat. This book was assigned to me, and I am now wondering why. Literature should have direction and goals it aims to accomplish when people read it. This is a randomly composed book about some old guy who goes fishing. Maybe if this book was set over the mans lifetime, and it described the trials and tribulations of his fishing as he ages, then it might be good. But the whole book was about one fishing trip. I don't suggest it unless you enjoy books that are essentially pointless. If you don't want to think, if you don't want to be inspired, if you are looking for something to read that won't give you any new opinions on anything, please read this book."
4,Most heartfelt but not his best,"""The Old Man and The Sea"" is not in my mind Hemingway's best work but it is the one story that I feel he felt the most for while writing. Hemingway lived life on his terms and he paid in many ways for that lifestyle. The old fisherman to me represents Hemingway's lifelong struggle to write clearly and simply. The story has a lot of heart in its depiction of an old man's struggle to never give up."
5,Man and his struggle in the food chain of life.,"Hemingway's ""The Old Man and The Sea"" although, not one of the finest books I have ever read, it is an exceptional and gritty discription of one mans (a Cuban fisherman) struggle with nature and himself. The battle rages in a hostile environment against a fish (marlin) doing only what it does best, survive. Not suprisingly, and unlucky for the fish, man finally reigns supreme, only to be bested by another fish, a shark which eats the marlin. With only the skelton remaining, the Cuban fisherman returns home to brag of his win. Man has survived for centuries because of his ability to struggle against unsurmountable odds and win.The same is still true today, regardless of the battle ground. The stock market, football, space travel, or taking the kids to the grocery, the goal is the same, to survive.When reading, see it as a reflection of your life and maybe you might have a better perspective on your place in the food chain."
4,Dr. Scholl's,"These arrived in a timely manner, and they feel great. May consider ordering another pair to keep from transferring them to another shoe."
5,molly age 18,"I just got this tape. I love it.I have been singing these songs fordays. And I can't get enough of this tape. I like the songs- Do Not Desturb,Trick of the night, Cut above the rest, Venus, and Ready or Not. They don't have dumb lyrics like so many popsingersdo today. They sound smart. I absolutely love the songs Dance with a stranger,True Confessions,Promised Land. These songs are really well done.The songs have feeling.They sure aren't boring!I like it. I totally recommend getting this tape.Dance with a stranger is such a beautiful song. This doesn't really matter, but, I like the outfits the girls are wearing on the cover! there awsome!"
4,"Different version of ""More Than Physical""","""True Confessions"" is a really fun Bananarama album. Includes their big 1980's radio hit ""Venus"" and a lot of other pop tunes. The album also includes the song ""Trick of the Night."" One thing about the album that I didn't appreciate was the version of the song ""More Than Physical."" I bought this album for this song since it didn't appear on the Greatest Hits compilation and the version of ""More Than Physical"" that is on ""True Confessions"" is not the same one as the United States single. If you can catch this one on sale it's not a bad addition to your 80's pop collection."
4,Good album,"I really like this album from 1986 by Bananarama, 1st had it on tape, now on c.d. I like the fact on this album the band wanted to be taken as more serious and mature as one can tell listening to the album. Some of my favorite tracks would have to be Ready Or Not, Do Not Disturb, Dance With A Stranger, Venus, and More Than Physical. Releasing albums like this it is no suprise Bananarama is the most popular girl group of all time."
4,Timeless album with great vocals by Bananarama; inc. VENUS,"This really is a great album, this work saw Bananarama move on to moodier, slick ballads and great dance tracks. it's the most introspective work and some of it is slow, and deliberate. you'll love it, especially Do not Disturb, which was one of their best 12' releases ever, unfortunately, who can find it?"
4,"True Confessions, Indeed","I love this CD back in the 1980s and still even now. I have always loved Bananarama's sassiness and the song choices exudes it. By all means, buy it."
4,An Allmost Perfect 90's Goth Album,"I respect this Band alot they kept talented Goth alive in the 90's. This album is their best and the only one I Would buy and Own. This is a reissue but the remastering is loyal to the original recording. The remix of ""Bondage song"" makes the orginal look awfull and you have two Versions of ""Kiss"" the hit short version and the original long classic version. The rest of the Album is all original mixes. The Vocals are new wavish with slight Marilyn Manson like tones the music is atmospheric Egyptian like and Heavy, Grungy, and Dancy slightly. ""Hate"" and ""A Letter to God"" are heavy and allmost thrash Like. ""Kiss"" is a Egyptian sounding classic. And ""Bondage Song"" is like a Dancy Techo Gothic song. Great album worth Buying But Not Perfect."
5,An excellent book about a little understood disorder.,"Cheryn writes this book from her heart. Having suffered from trichotillomania herself as a child and as an adult, and as a parent of a child with trich, she writes with passion, compassion, and first hand knowledge of what it is like to have this disorder. Having suffered in silence for years, she understands the isolation it can cause. And then to have her own children come up with the same disorder, she understands a parent's fears and frustrations. Written from the heart, this book is a must-read for any parent with a child suffering from trichotillomania, and good reading for anybody who either has, or know somebody who has trichotillomania."
5,I Love...,"I love Hercule Poirot! He is the most complex detective. Everyone else is utterly baffled and M. Poirot has everything figured out in his ""little grey cells"", and who could forget about Miss Marple? She is the queen of mystery and Hercule Poirot is the king! If these two were to work together then no evil mastermind could win. Miss Marple is as great as Dorothy Gilman's Mrs. Pollifax. Her cunning outsmarts us all. I just LOVED this book!"
4,Good Book,"This was a very delightful collection of stories. I loved when Mr. Parker Pyne found who stole the diamond. He is ranked with Agatha Christie's most demanding detectives in this book and he deserves it! Of course, Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, the most demanding detectives, are up to their usual perfection, solving murders and other such things.The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories is well worth the cost."
5,Short stories that are solid and scintillating,"This is a book for those fans of Agatha Christie and her cast of detectives, Pyne, Poirot and Marple. Since another reviewer of this book has written an excellent and thorough review of each of the nine short stories in this book, I will simply state that I found the short stories, which were originally published between 1932 and 1939, to be truly entertaining. Every reader will find the type that they prefer, but there is really something here for all of those who like a short and intense read. I have come to appreciate the form of the short story due to the necessary requirement to convey so much in succinct and descriptive ways. Dame Agatha was extraordinarily adept in this literary form. Pick it up, set it down, pick it up, again. Short and sweet...gotta love it."
2,Pedestrian,"Sophmoric and silly, it still might be a good second-choice for a teen book club. PG-13-rated sex pops up now and again, but no bad language and little violence besides an un-Viking-like punch or two. (In the Sagas guys carry axes and misunderstandings lead to body parts flying off.) Some of the best stories of the original get muddled or left out, so if you skim the dull parts, the book's not very long. For more advanced readers, I'd recommend the Sagas themselves."
3,Serviceable Western with a (Mostly) Fine Cast,"Filled with compelling characters, it feels as if this movie has many other things going on the background that we never become privy to. Perhaps since it is based on a series of books (Floating Outfit by J.T. Edson) explanations are provided there for character's motivations. Unfortunately, the pivotal role of female rancher Freida LaSalle, who is being forced off her property by a greedy land-baron, is inadequately portrayed by actress Walker Brandt. Gratuitous nudity serves absolutely no purpose to the advancement of the story. Although a familiar story, the movie successfully held my interest throughout."
5,Best Pan Ever,"I bought this pan from HSN a couple years ago and it came with a lid. It has been a hard-working, long lasting piece of cookware. It's great for cooking large meals - it can easily fry 10 chicken thighs all at once, and is great for poaching fish or making large one-pan stovetop meals."
1,Let the buyer beware...,"This is an Italian bootleg, and not from an Italian bootlegger with a good reputation like Great Dane."
4,Works very well,Adapted to an application not supported but works very well. Tech support from Holley was quick and very helpful. Really made an improvement over stock TBI.
4,Typical Playhouse Disney,"This DVD features two episodes of the computer-animated ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" television series. The first is an Easter special, Mickey's Great Clubhouse Hunt. In this double-length (49-minute) episode, when Mickey invites his friends over to celebrate the holiday, Pete seeks revenge when he is left out. There's a good song, ""The Best Easter Party Ever."" A second episode, ""Donald Hiccups"", finds the ""duck with all the bad luck"" unable to sing on Clarabelle Cow's TV show when he comes down with the spasms.Both shows include the typical Playhouse Disney dose of basic arithmetic, decision-making, music and puzzles. Other characters appearing include Ludwig von Drake, Chip 'n Dale (briefly), even Willie the Giant from the classic cartoon ""Mickey and the Beanstalk."" There's nothing ground-breaking here, but if your preschooler likes the TV show this is a nice addition."
2,cute but about easter,"My son likes this DVD, but I wouldn't have bought it had I known it was about Easter--would have been helpful info before buying!"
5,Great DVD,"My 6 month old son loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, so I decided to buy this DVD for him. I know this story by heart now. He loves this DVD, and I put it in when I need to take a shower or clean. I never have to worry about him being bored. He definitely is a Mickey Mouse addict!"
2,Could have been better.,"This item only had two shows on it and it cost as much as a video with four shows on it. I was disappointed. It's also an older version, which I didn't realize when I purchased the item."
4,Great DVD,"My son is absolutely obsessed with Mickey Mouse. This DVD is cute and centers around the Easter holiday, as far as decorated eggs, things like that. I would agree with some of the other reviews that they could have included more episodes on the DVD than just two for the price. That is my only reason for not giving it a full 5 stars. There is an episode about Donald getting the hicups which quickly spreads to everyone else and they have to use home remedies to get rid of the hicups so they can sing on Clarabell's TV show. My son is 2 and sits through the entire 2 episodes. All in all its a great DVD for your little one that can't get enough of Mickey Mouse."
5,Great entertainment,"I bought this video for my nephew who was getting ready to embark on a cross country drive. This video kept him entertained for many hours of this drive. It was not only entertaining, but educational. It amazes me what he learned from this video, and he is only 2! I highly recommend any of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse videos."
5,Very good,"The baby is very much entertained with the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVD""S. Needless to say, that makes me happy I bought it."
5,Great episode,"Great episode that my 18 month old son loves. He usually watches one or two Mickeys a day before I turn the TV off on him, and he gets a kick out of this episode in particular. When I give him a choice of DVDs he almost always picks this one. Must be something about Mickey..."
5,Disney did a good job,Keeping with the theme of the Mickey Mouse Club shows it is very similar and very entertaining for my toddler.
4,Easter Party?,"The only thing that I don't like about this is the fact that it's an Easter Party. It's like watching a Christmas movie in the middle of summer, you know? Anway it's great if your kids like the show but wishes it were longer than the tv episodes. My son is 2 1/2 and he loves it."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY! We used to expect more from Disney.,"My Toddler loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, so was excited to find this. Upon receiving however, you'll realize quickly upon assembly how poor the quality and how unbelievably flimsy it is.The elevator requires enough force that an adult has to operate it, and the flag that attaches to the top either doesn't stay in place jamming the elevator...or pops out all together. The slide barely stays attached for one or two treks down by one of the figures included. The movable ear falls off if you even look at it wrong. The lever to rotate Toodles barely works only ever giving 1 to half a rotation. The searchlight doesn't hold its position and simply flops down if not being held, plus the dim light drains the watch batteries (not included) in a very short time.I can't believe Disney put their name on this.Very disappointed, and already returned."
3,feel tricked,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter is currently watching this video and she is riveted. She loves the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on tv, so I shouldn't be surprised.I am really pissed off right now though. The video was given to my daughter as a gift from her geat-aunt. The box stated that the video is about a spring party. Only problem--it's actually an Easter party and we are Jewish! If I had known this I would never have allowed this video to be a gift for my daughter. Maybe she will enjoy the Donald hiccups episode, but I will never show her the Easter episode again."
2,Way too small for 4300,"For a case with a Nikon logo on it, it doesn't fit particularly well. Its on the small side, and doesn't have a shoulder strap. With this camera, you've gotta carry an extra batter, and the bag fits way too tight once you've stuck an extra batter in the front zipper compartment. I'd recommend getter a bigger, better aftermarket bag, like a Tamrac."
2,Way too small for Coolpix 4300,"For a case with a Nikon logo on it, it doesn't fit particularly well. Its on the small side, and doesn't have a shoulder strap. With this camera, you've gotta carry an extra batter, and the bag fits way too tight once you've stuck an extra batter in the front zipper compartment. I'd recommend getter a bigger, better aftermarket bag, like a Tamrac."
2,I agree; too small,"I'm not disparaging Nikon here; they make terrific product, but I also think this case is just too small for my Coolpix 4300. It's terrific quality and extremely rugged (love the extra compartmnent for memory cards, too), but the setting and power dials consistently shift when sliding the camera in/out of the case. Rather annoying when trying to take a quick picture as I always have to check my settings first. I returned for a replacement, thinking that perhaps the case was defective, but the others were small as well."
1,Too small for Nickon CoolPix 4300.,"The case is too small for my Nickon CoolPix 4300. I have to apply force / squeeze it in and out, which I don't want to do. First time when I try to take the camera out, the camera lens cover got stuck inside the case. I don't want to break my camera and hence I returned the case and purchased a bigger one."
5,Perfect Case for 4300,"I agree that those who say that the case is too small must be doing something WRONG. My 4300 fits perfectly in the case with room for a spare EN-EL1 battery and two CF cards in the front zipper pouch. No, you cannot ""quick draw"" the camera, but the case is designed for protection not speed. Don't hesitate to buy it if you need a case for your 4300. I have used this case for six years and it still looks new."
2,What a waste,"love the 4300 camera; hate the pricey bag/case ... the plastic hook broke the first day ... cheap ... still usable to protect camera, though I keep mine double protected, in this and a larger Nikon bag/case."
2,Great until the clip broke,Nice case until the clip broke after a few months. I still used it with half the clip intact until the other half broke a year later. Remember when things used to last for decades rather than months?
3,Too brief to give the beginner any confidence,"The book is essentially divided into two sections. The first covers the basic principles of wine making: the science behind it, the key ingredients, and the necessary tools and techniques. The second half is a pretty substantial list of recipes, concentrating heavily on country wines.Sadly, the coverage of the principles and techniques was too brief, particularly with regard to timing. I am still at a bit of a loss as to how long one should allow the aerobic ferment to take place, how long for the anaerobic format and so on. I think I'll be getting another book that focuses more on technique before I make my first attempt."
2,I had a hard time reading this book for some reason,"I don't know if it was the layout, or the similarity to the ""For Dummies"" series...it just was not a good choice for me."
5,Brilliant ambient-techno classic,This CD is an ambient-techno classic. Some of the tracks sound like ambient music from the golden age of Kraftwerk.
2,A brick to hit yourself over the head with,"If you are versed in postmodern theory and call yourself a ""Foucault Junkie"" as does V. Jabri, you will undoubtedly love this book. If you are a more typical human being who does not get off on clever semiotic turns of phrase and postmodern word play, you will hate this book. Just read the review by ""A Reader"" - if it makes sense to you and gets you excited, buy the book. If you have no idea what they are talking about, avoid this book like the Black Plague - it is more of the same."
5,Long Lost Album,"After losing this album in a devorce, actually my complete collection, 26 years ago, I found it at Amazon. I am very impressed with their service. Sure it isn't vinyl, but just like my new wife, it is class."
4,A CUT ABOVE most albums from 1982,"This album was in full swing back when MTV was great.Being a teenager albumsfrom every group were either bad or good.This one, although short on tracks is a delight to the ear.I've been a fan for years and they continue to produce good music.I visit their web site at WWW.GOLDEN EARRING.COM just to see what they're up to.Although TWILIGHT ZONE is in no way shape or form RADAR LOVE it still will be the song from the eighties as RADAR LOVE was for the seventies."
3,nice to have it available,"I bought this on a whim after hearing leonard Cohen and scott walker comparisons but would say this falls closer to a happy Nick drake or Tim Buckley. Apparantly this was impossible to find for many years and is now here some thirty plus years later. Nick Garrie himself says(in liner notes) he fells the album is way overproduced and it is for sure, The title track and first song is great though it reminds me of early Tim Buckley- and scattered across the album is about 7 good songs.(about 11 with the bonus material) The production and arrangements are taken to the extreme which works some of time but the more stripped down demo bonus tracks reveal more depth than the mostly overblown production. I still think its a worthy purchase and this will please fans of al stewart drake buckley and perhaps walker and cohen fans. Theres a mix of folk alittle psychedlia some chamber pop and even some ""country"" and overall im glad its in my collection."
3,"Great songs, okay vocals","It's not really fair to compare Jesse Harris and his band with the now famous Norah Jones who recorded them. She's got a very different, smoky, sultry voice. This album is sharp and the lyrics are just as poeticly loopy as anything Harris has written before. I've always been more interested in the words than the singing so I enjoyed it."
4,This is an excellent technique which is well described,"Watsu is a fabulous technique . The book describes the many aspects of watsu; bringing in the Zen Shiatsu,meridians, Tantsu, intimacy, the therapy and the modifications needed to perform watsu on a variety of bodies. This technique must be experienced to be understood. It will help to change you and change the way we interact with each other. For any person who likes the water it is enchanting. For those who are not so excited about the water, it may change your mind."
2,BEWARE its a Cuscus brand,"Why was it not advertised as a Cuscus bag, it seems a deceiving misrepresenting practice? Shipping charges are outragous at $8.99? Go to cuscus website and you can buy it for $29.95 incl. shipping."
1,Useless,"When this bag arrived, I excitedly attempted to throw it over my shoulder, only to have the clasp open and fall right off. Confused, I spent 20 minutes fiddling with the plastic clasp that keeps the upper and lower portions of the strap together, only to finally decide that it must have been molded wrong or something, because it refuses to stay closed. Even the slightest bit of pulling-pressure on the clasp causes it to release, even if you haven't pushed the ""safety tabs"" in.I e-mailed the company asking them how to return the bag for a new one, but was asked to ""make a video or something"" showing what the problem was. I didn't bother to respond -- if they're going to force me to ""prove"" the problem just to exchange the bag, it's not worth my time.This bag is a piece of crap, and their customer service's roadblock to solving the problem earns them 1-star. Thanks for wasting my $20!"
4,Perfect but bit smaller than I expected,I use it for my college... i can carry few thin or one think book with one or two note books. I don't have to carry loads of books everyday anyway.. sometime I use it for carrying laptop although I have a bag for laptop..
5,Took us around Europe!,"We bought this bag as a day pack for our 18 trip around Europe. We used it every single day, stuffed it to the max, threw it all over the place, hotels, trains, planes and automobiles (ha). And it held up unbelievably well! It's comfortable to wear and it held a ton of stuff. Plus there are some ""hidden"" pockets to give you even more space! I don't know if those pockets are supposed to be ""hidden"" but we didn't see them until we'd been using the pack for a few days. So it was like a little bonus! LOL A great little pack. Worth the money, really sturdy."
1,"Poor quality, broken zipper, ripped lining in less than 2 months","Length:: 2:09 MinsThis poorly made backpack is featured in my video review. After only 45 days I have two broken zippers, a defective cell phone holder, a ripped lining, and a broken shoulder strap. The seller, Adventure Bag, and Amazon refused to work with me on a return because it is past 30 days. It has only been 45 days and I am now out the money and have to throw this defective low quality backpack away. The worst backpack I have ever had followed by an even more upsetting customer service call to this seller left me mortified enough to leave this video review. I would not trust purchasing anything from this company."
3,Review on messenger pack,"It is a nice pack and well made. It was purchased for a good price. Unfortunately for me it isn't quite big enough as a regular day pack and I have found it a little small for going someplace where you may purchase something and then pack it away yourself. It won't carrier a full sized portfolio for 8 1/2 x 11"" tablets or I haven't used it correctly to do so. I thought it would be easier to carry but I think I may end up staying with my day pack."
1,backpack,"The backpack has been carefully used for two weeks, but already one of the outside straps across the pocket for a water bottle has ripped out. Looks like not enough of the strap was sewn into the seam."
5,A radical book for radical times,"Rev. Anderson has an excellent grasp of relational Christology and writes in a straight forward manner with great clarity and humor. Her personal story of coming to faith is captivating and offers encouragement to those who struggle with questions such as: Who is this Jesus? What does he mean to me? Does he make any difference in my life? She nailed it down when she wrote:""Following Jesus is a radical step. It is not to be religious: it is to have a relationship with a person, who, in fact, calls into question everything about our lives and moves us in directions that go against all that the world thinks is important."" Well done. She answers the question as to who Jesus is to her, details her shocking experience of being used by God for the physical healing of another and invites us into relationship with God that will indeed change everything. An excellent book, easy to read, hope filled and life changing. I will read anything that this author writes."
4,"Nicely, darkly styled, but can you dance to it?",This is a pleasant and quiet performance on medieval fiddle and drums of medival dance material that most people with a taste for early music are going to find very familiar.Violist Jordi Savall emphasized the virtuosic nature of the melodic lines of the medival dances. He is assisted by some very understated and reverb-heavy percussion. The understated tone of the medieval fiddle and the often rather staccato performances make for a quieter and more musical experience than you will get when this material is performed on shawms and sackbuts.What seems to be missing is the sense that anyone was ever able to dance to this stuff.
1,"ALL THESE TRACKS ARE AVAILABLE ON ""ANTHOLOGY""","There's no reason to pay big bucks for this out-of-print CD, as all of the tracks are available on the ""Anthology"" 2CD... and, in far superior remastered audio quality than on this disc."
5,classic,"I,ve been waiting and hoping this would become available. A real LIVE club sound, this is the kind of music that was heard all over in ""The Village"" Coffee Houses & Bars."
2,Very Disappointing,"I cannot believe that this book was allowed to go to print. As I read it, I was tempted to pull out my red pencil and edit as I went along. The repetition was more than I could bear and the writing was so elementary as to be insulting to the average reader. I can't believe that a writer with the kind of experience that Danielle Steel has doesn't even use quotation marks correctly. Unbelievable.The sad thing is, this could have been a powerful story. Ms. Steel lost her own son and certainly knows a mother's pain. That is where the problem lies. Her character Alice is strong and well developed. But no one else is. If she had spent more time on this book it might have been different. But, as usual, she power-wrote yet another and it didn't click."
5,Awesome,"This book was great. It had my eyes tearing with only a few pages. But don't worry, it's not a terribly sad book.A family goes through changes as it copes with the death of Johnny, a loving son and brother.Johnny comes back as an Angel and helps his friends and family move on and live better lives.It's a great read. You won't be able to put the book down. Danielle Steel is a wonderful author and I can't wait to read other books by her."
4,Heartbreaking,"I really enjoyed this book. You can feel the pain of the loss of her son in this book, which makes it so real."
4,my mom recommended this,"My mom thought this was the best book and she said it would make me cry. Well, my mom is a smart woman and normally has good taste so I decided to give it a try. Halfway through the book I hated it and didn't want to read anymore. However, I'm not a quiter so I read it to the end and I'm glad I did. The ending was so wonderful I cried and laughed."
1,Is Danielle Steel really this bad a writer?,"This is literally one of the most poorly written books I have ever read, which came as somewhat of a shock as it is Steel's 58th bestseller. The story lacks depth and complexity, the characters lack development, the writing is repetitive, and everything is generally one-dimensional. Did she hire an intern to compose this book for her??"
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this book thinking that it would be like some of her other books, but I agree with some of the other readers. This book was like reading it over and over again. Had the same sentence over and over just in different sequence order. It was a childish story. We had a death in a family member and it's been over 7 yrs and we still cannot get over it. My ex-sister in law took her more than 5 yrs to move on and start dating again. So this book is not even close to reality. If you love someone so much, it doesn't take you just 4 months to get over that person. I do not recommended this book to anyone to read. Very Very disappointed in Daneille Steel for even thinking in publishing it. She must of had a mood swing or something."
1,Serious Danielle Steel Fans.... Skip it!,"Definately not one of Steel's best. I was disappointed. I thought the plot was corny! It was an easy read, but I felt like I was reading a novel written for young teens. Every turn of the page was another predictible twist that just didn't add up to true Steel writing. If you liked ""Granny Dan"" or ""Silent Honor"", skip this book. You'll be disappointed."
3,"Cried my eyes out, but...","I guess it's really true when they say that it's all about the story. The story is a great one, and the tragedy of losing a child in an auto accident is too often experienced by heartbroken families. I'll forever remember the characters and the story. It is one mother's way of coping with her loss. That being said, the repetition was a problem with this book, and some things that would have been picked up by a careful reading were left for the reader to say ""say what?"" I've read only one or two of Steel's novels, and this one sticks out because of the characters despite the way in which it was written."
3,"Story good, poor editing","I have read a lot of Danielle Steel books and usually enjoy them completely. But this book was lacking in editing -- there was a lot of typos the worse one is a very confusing daughter's name; she is Charlie sometimes and Charlotte sometimes as well, sometimes even in the same paragraph the name changes! The story of an angel come to help a greiving mother and her son deal with an older son's death was moving. Skip purchasing this book unless you find it in a thrift store or a discount bin, I have to wonder if Danielle Steel even wrote this book --- it does not read like her writing. It is sort of like a story plot from ""Touched By An Angel"" TV show."
3,johnny angel,johnney angel is a sad book of johnny dying too soon. missed by his whole family that they become dysfunctioal with his lost. He returns as a vision to his brother and mother to help his family to function normaly. It's an easy read. I finished in one sitting.
3,"Not horrible, but not great!","This book was OK. Danielle steel has written much much better books with deeper, more interesting, and emotional plots. The story seemed drawn out. However, it's still readable and enjoyable, and was definitely different than the typical DS book - so for that I give it 3 stars."
3,Johnny Angel,"I expected more from this book to be honest. I expected to cry more and to laugh more. I cried when they told the family about his death, and I got misty at the ending that was kind of sweet. And I felt the mothers pain grieving for her son, but not much else for the rest of the story. Seemed like it just kept rambling on with the characters saying and doing the same things."
2,anti climatic,I was dissapointed with this book. I kept reading it in hopes that something really incredible was going to happen but unfortunatly never did. The characters were vague and the story line redundant and ends without closure.
3,Where's the old Danielle?,"With ever new Danielle Steel book i read i seem to get more and more disappointed..Is it possible to have so many great books early on in her career then nothing? If you readers want great romance and heart wrenching books, try Kirk Martin...these are a must for ever reader..he's a great new author with amazing stories to tell...www.KIRKMARTIN.COM trust me you will be so happy you listened to me...you won't be able to put these books down..they are a cross between Nicolas Sparks and Bridges Of Madison County....a must read..."
2,Somewhat disappointing! What happened Danielle?,"I really am a big fan of most of Danielle Steel's body of work. I've read the vast majority of her books - purchased and listened to many of them as audio books...and even seen the ones that have been made into movies. This was pretty disappointing! I had purchased ""Dating Game"" the same time I got ""Johnny Angel"". ""Dating Game"" was everthing that ""Johnny Angel"" wasn't! The book was thin in every way - the story line and the characters were lacking...and the whole thing reminded me of a beefed up short story. Hardly worth the $7.50 I paid for the paper back! Also, the entire time I was reading it, I felt like someone was pulling my leg. It was somewhat entertaining - but I certainly would never be interested in re-reading it - which I often do with her other works! It has the same silly fantasy of ""The Klone"". I guess every once in awhile Ms Steel blows a mind fuse! Hopefully, she'll get back on track with the next book! Let's keep our fingers crossed!"
2,let down,I have read every one of Danielle Steel's books...however...this one was a real let down. Very predictable and boring. If you are looking for a great read...pass this one up. Hope this isn't the future for this writer...she seems to running out of good materail.
2,Review of Johnny Angel,"Although, this story is touching and will bring tears to your eyes, I couldn't help but feel let down after finishing the book. This was definitely not on a par with most of Danielle Steel's work. The book seemed short and the characters were not given any real depth of personality. It was almost as if they were held at a distance from the reader. Sorry, this is just not a ""Steel Classic""."
3,Johnny Angel by Danielle Steel,I found this book very easy to read. The story line in the book was predictable and i did enjoy reading it I would say it is a light read and like most of her books they seem to always tell the same type of story line and I guess I am looking for something to really get involved in but this was not that book.although I did end up likeing the book and would recommand it for a light read.
4,Johnny Angel,Very good Dannielle Steel book as always. It is amazing all the good stories she comes up with. This one was very heart felt. Enjoyed from start to finish
2,Not one of Danielle Steel's best,"The story was touching, yet highly unrealistic. There was also too much redundancy. I thought this was an easy, yet disappointing read. I wonder if Steel has to meet a quota each year, and this was the by-product? Not her best book."
4,So Good,"The only other Danielle Steel book I've read was Sunset In St. Tropez, which I didn't fully enjoy. But this book...I loved. It was very touching and even if you've never dealt with a loss, you still felt like you could relate with the characters. I didn't give it a 5 because I'm very picky about my books."
4,A quick but far-fetched read!!!,"Johnny Angel is one of those books you can read in one sitting......quite the good read.....definitely a bit far-fetched, but good nonetheless. The end was not what i was expecting and some excerpts were repeated over and over....which happens alot in most DS books.I was truly delighted with Bobby's progree.. i would recommend this book to any die-hard DS fan."
2,Simple as it can be,I am an avid Danielle Steel reader but this one is not one of her best. The concept was a good one but it was written in such simple language. The characters could have had a bit more depth. Maybe next time...I know she is capable for much better writing!!
5,Strong alternative arrangements,"Most people who know Morricone may pass over buying this CD thinking it is a compilation of previous efforts. It is not - they are completely new arrangements. The recording quality of the tracks is superb, and while I was not thrilled with ALL the track selections, the important thing that Morricone fans will appreciate is that there are at least 4 rapsodic masterpieces. ""On Earth As It Is in Heaven"" is given the definitive treatment, and that annoying repetitive piano in the original of the Love Theme from ""Cinema Paradiso"" has wisely been excised by the Mastro in the new arrangement here. Overall, the CD is highly recommended."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER!!,"Hysteria is one of the best rock albums EVER! The first single I heard was Pour Some Sugar On Me as a child and I was hooked. While some artists tell stories, Def Leppard captures a feeling. Sometimes when I listen to it I feel like I'm flying! The entire album is excellent. Every song is well polished and flows into one another very well. The guitar riffs are hair raising. The drums pump me up! I thank the creator for Def Leppard."
5,Treamendous Effort!,"Def Leppard made one heck of an album with ""Hysteria"". From top to bottom it has an endless amount of hits. It has the radio rocker ""Pour Some Sugar on me"". It has awesome loud, fast hard rockers with ""Run Riot"". Other good songs are ""Animal"", ""Rocket"", and ""Women."" And also, if you like slow depressing songs then ""Love Bites"" is the one for you."
2,LANGE = MIDAS TOUCH,"Producer Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange is really a rich man, because he can turn things into gold. He got the Midas Touch. This guy produced BACK IN BLACK for AC/DC, then COME ON OVER (by his wife Shania Twain), two of the best selling albums of all times, and also PYROMANIA and HYSTERIA, the best selling albums by Def Leppard. So, it's clear that this guy knows his business.The trouble with Hysteria is that, in my opinion, the catchy songs featured here would still sell millions of copies if they were recorded with heart, not with total commercialism. As it was, this is a robotic album, devoid of any feelings in the approach to the songs, not the songs themselves. Ok, we must acknowledge the fact that the band kept drummer Rick Allen after he lost his arm, demonstrating they are supportive and generous men.After Hysteria, Def Leppard went into the ""love songs"" market, and never looked back..."
3,Not Sure How This Got Classic Album Status,"This isn't even Def Leppard's best album, let alone one of the best ever. (I like Pyromania better.) It has great moments. ""Hysteria,"" ""Love Bites,"" and ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" are right up there among the band's best. But the one word titles, like ""Animal,"" ""Women,"" and ""Rocket"" tend to blend together for me, and even now I can't tell them apart. Stick with Pyromania if you're new to Def Leppard."
4,Now this is pop rock from Def Leppard,"You know, looking at the reviews on Pyromania, most everyone writes about how it's a great pop metal album, pop rock this and that. In comparison to this album, Pyromania is hard rock and roll, and Hysteria is a radio friendly, songs easily accessible for singles, lite metal, pop rock. Yeah, there are some great songs on here...but it just seems this band went balless after this release. I mean Women, Love and Affection, Love bites, come on...is this a Def Leppard album or Bon Jovi?!? Oh well, Rocket, Animal, Pour Some Sugar on Me, Armageddon It, Hysteria are all great tracks in between stuff that unfortunately would turn the band into pusses in about 4 years"
5,ARMAGEDDON IT!!!,"Indisputably Def Leppard's best album. ""Armageddon It,"" ""Pour Some Sugar on Me,"" ""Rocket,"" and ""Hysteria"" are among some of the best songs the band has ever written, and they're all on this album. The real gem to me is ""Love Bites,"" but the entire album just kicks serious ass!!! It is still great to listen to today after over a decade."
4,"Still good, but not as hard as ""High and Dry""","I still listen to this album regularly even though I'm a metalhead by nature. There's something sure to please everyone, after the initial letdown of expecting the crunching guitar riffs a la old Def Lep."
5,"""Are you getting it ?""....you should","This is the masterpiece that Def Leppard had been working for since 1978 when they first formed the band. It's got every type of Rock song ever imagined on here. Nothing to complain about at all from this album. It's commercial sure but one of the things you can appreciate about this band is they're not sell outs. All they try to do is sell as many records to as many rock fans that will listen so they can go out and play them even better for you live (3 personal experiences myself). This album is the perfect album to prove it with. The deluxe edition is a REAL FAN thing though, I mean anyone who just wants this album for Pour Some Sugar On Me and Love Bites, or even Animal should buy the regular edition. But if you want vintage and rare Leppard...or if you're a b-sides collector...get this version. Either way GET THIS ALBUM !"
4,This CD is too much!!,This album is amazing. I never even listened to rock that much until this CD. Pour Some Sugar On Me and Love Bites are my two favorite songs. If you like rock I recommend this CD highly. It is the BOMB.
5,STILL HOT,I HAD THIS TAPE YEARS AGO AND WORE IT OUT FROM PLAYING IT SO MUCH. THIS CD IS STILL HOT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS! A MUST FOR ANY FAN OF HEAVY METAL. YOU WILL NOT BE DIAPPOINTED!
1,80's Bubblegum rock,"I was a fan of Leppard during their Pyromania era but this album is just more of beating a tired, dead, not that great to begin with horse. Not a whole lot to say other than this album sounds the same as every album from this era, not to good just popular."
5,Hysteria - Def Leppard 2 disk set,WOW. Great remastered sound. The 2nd CD has a great blend of remix (extended) songs and live versions. As always great music.
5,Eighties classic,"I rarely listen to Side Two, but they could have packaged the first side together, thrown in ""Hysteria"" and released the greatest album ever made. I won't complain about the other songs from the second side, like ""Gods of War"", ""Don't Shoot Shotgun"" or ""Love and Affection"", but after a run of singles like the first side...well, who could still breathe after a flawless run like that? Amazing album, one of the best of the Eighties, and the best for any frat party (not that I'd know, of course...)."
5,I can't believe it took this long for me to realize...,This is an essential album to have in one's collection if you are in any way a DEF fan - I have no idea how I overlooked it for so long. Glad I was still able to get it!
3,NO COVER,"As a Def Leppard fan I was looking forward to getting a cd and cd cover. I got a cd with no cover. I can't read credits about the band, see pics, etc. Now I have to buy another copy. I could have gotten (just) the music anywhere."
5,An album that still rocks!,"This album is awesome! I purchased it the day it came out on cassette tape back in 1987 and purchased the CD in 1990. I wore the CD out after 20 years and had to get a replacement. I love every single song on this album. To call this ""commercial"" is ridiculous. This album with Pour Some Sugar on Me, Armageddon It, Rocket, Love Bites, Don't Shoot Shotgun, Hysteria, and Excitable is one that you will listen to for a long time to come. After 25 years, I still enjoy putting it on in my truck and blasting each and every track! This album rocks! God bless Steve Clark!"
2,15 million Lep fans CAN be wrong... and are!,"I'm sorry but there's like two great songs on here and the rest, to me, epitomizes everything that was wrong with eighties pop music. Overblown, pretentious, and painfully predictable. I can't believe I used to like these guys when I was a wee tot, and didn't even know that bands like the Replacements or Husker Du existed simply because they wouldn't play them on the radio. Oh well. Might as well get the greatest hits CD. It has ""Rock of Ages"" AND ""Armageddon It"" on it, so that's cool. Oh and pick ""Slippery When Wet"" too. But that's IT. No more mainstream pop! I can only take so much of this ""Rock On!"" schtick. You?"
2,Def Lep sell out,"I was so hyped to get this album when it was released. After the double shot High & Dry and Pyromania, Def Leppard could do no wrong in my eyes.... Then they released Hysteria. Very polished, very slick, very pop. The metal was gone and so was I as one of their fans."
1,"Love the cd, but it doesn't play","It came in horrible condition. It looked like it was scraped with a knife. It plays half of the first song, and then you get nothing from the rest of the CD. It's totally useless. Had to toss it. I had to wait a couple months to get it too."
2,hysterical,"I am a huge Def Leppard fan: love On Through the Night, High 'N' Dry, and Pyromania. So tonight i finally broke down and bought Hysteria. I listened to ""Def Leppard's best"" and it is awful. Listening to this album after listening to High 'N' Dry is like going from a steak and bar-b-que diet to eating sushi and broccolli. It just doesn't go over well. I might have to go and puke out the over-produced and over-thought out ""licks"" of this album. Perhaps if i had gotten this album before Pyromania then it might have gone over better. Thank goodness i bought Pyromania first! Pre-Hysteria Def Leppard rocks, sushi Leppard sucks. The songs on this album are just too slow, or sound ""fake"" per-say. Def Leppard must've been *Wasted* when they made this album."
4,great remaster but...,just a gripe about the collectible aspect of this item. the bifolding case with plastic slip cover is such a pain to handle. you have to slip off the plastic cover to get to the bifolding case of the cd. not a one handed operation like you can with a regular cd jewel case. makes it hard to get the cd when youre driving. so dont ever lose the slip cover or you will end up with flying double cds.
5,Back in the days when I got drunk before going dancing...,"This is one of my favorite albums to listen to,drunk or sober. Its great music, artistically. And if music can be exciting to you, this is very exciting. I have to jump, scream and turn the sound up when this comes on the radio. There are not many albums that pass this test. Another was Led Zeppelin, but that's another story..."
1,This cd is OLD.,Please save your money. Do not buy trash like this. Of course if are in sane and like 80's music and u are a Def Leppard fan u might like this but if u are a normal person u likes 90's music don't waste money buying this or your time listening to it.
1,"Sorry, Fabio","I didn't realize that yours was the only opinion that mattered, but being the man I am, I can respect the fact that you like the Def Leppard prom band versus the Def Leppard rock band of a few years earlier."
1,"Lame, Lame and Weak!","This album is both lame and weak I bought this hopping it would rock like everyone says it would but it doesnt! ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" and ""Rock It"" are the only good songs on this album, all the rest are either Lame or very weak! ...this one doesnt get the job done!"
1,I'll never understand this one,"How can a band go from teetering on the edge of pop-metal greatness, as Def Leppard did with [i]Pyromania[/i}, then suddenly do an about face and start jockeying to take Journey's place on the power-ballad parade? To call this pop-metal is a slap in the face to anyone who likes the volume set on 11. Or 5. Plop-metal is more like it because it's the sound these turds make when they start the trip through the waste treatment system. No wonder Steve Clark drank himself to death. He probably couldn't stand to look at his sold-out face in the mirror."
1,Go figure why...,"Def Leppard records their two first albuns, ON THROUGH THE NIGHT and HIGH 'N DRY. THe two of them are hard rock at its best. Then they release PYROMANI. Already utterly commercial, but still a sdtrong album. THen they hit the jackpot with the worst album so far, HYSTERIA. Go figure... An album filled with flat drumming, commercial production, sugary and awful ballads, the worst possible ingredients from hair-metal...."
2,It has to be said,"When Pyromania came out it was a breath of fresh air. In fact, even today that album sounds great. However, I blame this album for great deal of the cheese factor of the 80's. I know that it sold more copies than the bible but it really was a disappointing follow up. It hasn't worn well with time, and while I can respect that some people love this album and its songs, I think it's fair for me to say that just hearing the phrase ""Do you take sugar, one lump or two"" gives me tremors.(This review was edited to give two stars. Some friends convinced me I wasn't being completely fair. It gets an extra star for meaning so much to so many, whether or not I ""get it"" or not.)"
2,Lange = midas touch,"Producer Robert John Lange got the midas touch. Working with very different type of artists, he managed to produce three of the best selling albums of all time: AC/DC's Back in Black, Shania Twain's COME ON OVER and, on a lesser scale, Def Leppard's HYSTERIA and PYROMANIA. SO, the guy knows his craft, no doubt about that.But that does not mean that HYSTERIA is such a great album, no way! Much on the contrary, it marked the end of Leppard's ""hard rock days"", and tranformed them into a totally commercial outfit, full of ballads, cliched love lyrics, all fruit of an totally focused effort to appeal to MTV audience and girls.Also the sound production is terribly glossy, rounded, polished. The drums were the worst part of all (I'm not taking awaya the merits of drummer Rick Allen hard recovery after his accident. I'm talking about the highly reverbed drum sound, not the drummer's technique!)Is imply do not like this album. I prefer their first three albums."
5,Def Leppards Best,"two words... MUTT LANG. He can produce a monkey playing a banjo and make it sound good. Def Leppard is awesome in this album. One of a few albums I can listen to over and over and over again. Im buying Euphoria today, I heard that was comparable to Hysteria. One question - Does Def Leppard have a PHOBIA or something? i.e. Hysteria, pyromania, euphoria..."
5,Last GREAT album,"Its 1987 and again Def Leppard are working with Mutt Lange (producer). This is the last album to feature the great late Steve ""steamin"" Clark on guitar. Even though this album was more syth pop than guitar driven like the early material this was still a damn fine album. I do agree with some that it was overblown in terms of production and it was more polished than pyromania. all the songs are top notch not a bad track on here my favorites are all of them with the expection of Excitable not too keen on that one for some reason. recommended to the max."
3,More of pop rock,"Def Leppard's first 3 cds i though were great. Then this cd came out. Just seems more of a pop rock cd. I guess thats cool if you like that kinda stuff, but if you like heavier def leppard go get High N Dry or Pyromania. Both really good records."
5,its so sincere,On this album i love the song Baghdad Cafe (Callin u).The song reminds of a romantic moment I had with my girlfriend. I first heard the song from houseafrika vol-2 mixed by Dj Vinny Da Vinci.
5,Best ever!,"This is the best discman ever! The sound is the best and so far I haven't found anything wrong with it except that you either use regular batteries or you have to use a specific kind of rechargeable battery. But, other than that, it is the best discman ever! There are many different kinds of functions that are easy to control and work. There is a really great kind of function called ESP and it uses a buffer to limit skips to around once when I am running (or walking), and it is sooooooo! easy to work, it has it's own button that you push to turn on or off. There's also an AVLS (Auto Volume Limiter System)function that makes the volume have a limit, and even at the lowest, it sounds great!"
5,Outstanding!,"This is my go-to book for all things pertaining to the history of American Literature. It's comprehensive, yet concise. It's intelligently written, yet not stilted. Genius!"
2,Book for a class,"What I did read of it was not very good. It is full of information and is a great choice for a history major maybe, but not me. I found it very hard to read as an English major."
4,Great Product,"Ordering was great it just took a week, and it was within the same state 4 hours away. But overall everything was good"
2,Marriages and Families: Diversity etc...,"Hold your nose on this one, folks!While there is some solid educational value to be gleaned from this work, I fear the trouble to filter the good from the bad makes this an untenable text, especially for those new to the dicipline.Why is this work so bad? Simply reams and reams of feminist twaddle! This book is literally infested with the so-called ""facts"" and ""scholarship"" from that bankrupted, poisonous and scientifically discredited ideology called feminism.One does have to appreciate the irony: the very people who have nearly succeeded in destroying the family - feminists - are writing a book about the family!This book is from the wonderful and whacky world of ""wymin's studies"" and should be avoided like the plague! Really, there are truly scientifically sound and unbiased works out there. Do yourself a favour and find them."
1,Horrible,"I bought this book 2 weeks before my class started. The delivery dates kept changing. I never received it so I had to purchase it from another website. Because of this, I had to turn in my assignment for class late. I received an email saying that I would be credited but I have not checked my statement yet. We'll see."
2,NOT WELL MADE AT ALL,"Slime 22013 5-50 PSI Pencil Gauge with Bonus CapsThis gets the job done, however it is very poorly made. Not medal, it is plastic."
1,Not a good fit.,This diffuser is not a good fit. It flies off my dryer! I bought it because the item description reads:Fits like a glove on T3 Tourmaline dryer model # 83808. I bought the dryer mentioned and the diffuser to go with it. It Does not Fit!!!!
2,Disappointed,"Initially, I loved it. Fit like a glove on the blow dryer I bought that was ""supposed"" to be compatible. Now it won't stay on the blow dryer and is useless when trying to dry my hair in certain positions."
1,Poorly Made,"When this Diffuser starts to get too hot, it falls off the dryer, and the two pieces come about. I love my T3 Dryer, but they need to make a better diffuser, for such an expensive dryer."
2,Diffuser,It works well if you can keep the small tips found on the inside from breaking. Not built to well and cost too much.
3,Beatles never sounded better,"BOY! This guy doesn't just write like Lennon... he sounds just like him, too. The songwriting on Spin This is very good but the Rembrandts would be a better band if they would lose the sythesizers and just stick to an organic rock sound. The best song on this album, ""Long Walk Back"" (co-written by Jessie Valenzuela of Gin Blossoms fame) is a rock and roll gem, and will no doubt make the playlist at countless rock format radio stations, but, unfortunately, it's hard for me to take an album so eighties-ish seriously."
1,90-degree elbow hose fitting,The threads on one of the fittings that I purchased were damaged upon arrival. It prevents the fitting from being threaded onto the carb making it useless. Somebody needs to do a little QA I think.
3,Coulda been better,"I didn't know how this album could be as good as their first, but I still bought it. I was excited because their first CD rocked. Well, there's a couple good songs on this CD... ""Gypsy Girls"" is a very nice melodic rock song. ""Something"" is probably the best song on there. It's the hardest song on the CD. He sings, and on certain parts, he screams the last word of the line. It's a fun song. ""I Won't Give Up"" has a great catchy chorus, and a nice guitar solo in the bridge. The rest of the songs are just like... Bleh... They are a talented band, and I believe they could have done a lot better on this record to produce an album as awesome as their first one.Their heart for God is amazing though. God bless Everyday Sunday and their ministry. And God bless their next album; hope it doesn't continue to go downhill."
1,Please Please Please Plase Break Up,"Everyday Sunday I gave youa second chance to make a good record and you can't do it. Break Up. I will buy 100cd's right now, if you never release another record again. This CD was a huge let down."
4,"nice but, no printed manual.........","This is a great software program to, get started in realisation of all the components of your computer and, the relationship of midi to it. The features are vast but, ah there is no printed manual. You have to download it from the software itself.I like being able to read the information from text and, also manipulate the screen. I would have given the software five stars except for the fact that, there is no manual included with the product bundling.If you don't mind shuttleing back and forth on your screen, you will love this software. Otherwise, a word of caution. This may take a while to understand."
2,Disappointed with this product,"If you have a newer computer using USB connections, don't buy this kit. The cable they supply won't work, and you have to find a USB to MIDI adapter somewhere else. I got fooled when I saw it was designed for use with Windows XP, and didn't realize that they meant it could be used by older computers that have upgraded to XP.So, I've got to spend more money. ... The software is useless without the right cable connection.I was also disappointed to learn from the manual that their software won't convert the MIDI files to .WAV format for creating my own CDs. Voyetra recommends you buy some more of their software (""AudioView"") to do that job.This product may have some value if you have an older computer, but it is not what they claim to be. It does not include ""everything you need to create great sounding music..."""
2,Software company not upfront with marketing package.,"I used voyetra orchestrator for over 5 years. I think it was a great learning tool for both digital audio and midi. I record 100% digital and wanted to replace my older version with a newer one. I found this starter kit and thought that it was basically the same as I had before because I looked all over the box and couldn't find anything that said it only includes 4 digital audio tracks. (how can anyone get started with two stereo channels?). I wouldn't have purchased it if I would have known that. Now I am stuck with it. If all a person does is midi, I guess this will work, but if you want to ""start"" incorporating digital audio, you should buy something else. I don't enjoy it when companies try to slide one by it's customers by not listing important info that should be disclosed even if it ends up hindering sales. shame on those Marketing people!"
2,Misleads on included cable,"I agree with the Jan. 3rd 2003 reviewer. The enclosed cable will not work with my 2002 Dell laptop.[] This is double the price of the Software, which, by the way is OK. If the correct cable(s) were included, the package as a whole gets 4 stars..."
4,Made me cry.,"I grew up with this movie and hearing the songs brought back the awesome childhood memories. ""One little star"" and ""I'm so blue"" brought tears to my eyes. ""Upside down world"" on the other hand cracked me up. I didn't think about it much when I was little, but when Ernie and Bert flew that airplane upside down I don't think they realized that they were asking for certain death. lolThe only downside is there are monologues for a lot of the songs and I'm not really into that kind of thing. Plus the ""One Little Star"" song starts one minute into the track."
4,I loves it,I may be 18 now but I grew up on this movie and the soundtrack is a great addition to any cd library
2,Bit by the Flea - Don't Waste your money!,Content not as expected. Cost is too much for this book. Don't waste your money.
1,UnFabiolous,"Fabiola was a major international success when it was released abroad in 1947. Boasting gigantic sets, crowds of thousands and a stellar international cast-Fabiola told its story of Christian martydom in 150 minutes. With its massive recreation of the Colisseum, gladiatorial bouts, the Christian persecution. It was a sight to behold. In 1951 Hercules producer Joe Levine took the original film, edited it down to 89 minutes and dubbed it into English--just to get the jump on MGM's massive Quo Vadis which basically covered the same territory. Fabiola is better in its original running time--even in black and white. This is the grindhouse version. Beware."
3,Good (almost Great) News: DVD release of complete version in France,"From IMDb.com, Jan., 2011: In 2010, FABIOLA was released on DVD in France by Gaumont in two parts, ""Fabiola 1re époque - Mirage de Rome"" and ""Fabiola 2e époque - Le sang des martyrs."" The film appears to be complete, but is in French only, with optional French closed captioning. The DVDs are currently on offer at Amazon.fr."
5,A PEPLUM MASTERPIECE,"The short version of an italian masterpiece, not available in Europe. One of the Martin Scorcese's favorite movies. The original novel was a little bit boring, but this peplum capture a good feeling of events, the last month of the pagan Rome, filled with romance, action and a wonderful art direction. A must see, which deserve a good image restauration in his original length.Christophe Champclaux"
2,Disappointing DVD of an excellent film,"When I saw the original version of the movie 'Fabiola' many years ago, it was an excellent film, so recently I wished to see it again on a DVD, which I looked for in many different venues, but it appeared to be out of circulation, until I found it in Amazon. So I ordered it. Even though some reviews mentioned it had a few cuts for the US exhibition, I bought it, and to my great disappointment I realized that, with the exception of the last sequences of Christians massacred at the Colisseum (an impressive display of realistic and wonderfully directed section of the film), the whole presentation was marred not only by big cuts but also by its unrestored images, which appear badly scratched and showing the film's age.However, it was great to see old-time French and Italian stars as Michele Morgan, Henri Vidal, Michel Simon and Gino Cervi.The experience was like acquiring an Old Masters painting discolored by neglect and carelessness."
3,Better than nothing,"It's still sad, that we only get half of the original film, which originally was the fist impressive monumental film in the gladiator genre. Especially the beginning of the story is cut to short sequences.What remains is still very impressive acting from Henry Vidal and Michelle Morgan, who after filming together here became a couple until Vidal's early death.Let's hope that some day the whole original will be released in the original language with english subtitels.It would have been helpful to know that this version was cut to half of the original lengh.Still - good to have at least this version."
4,Fabiola,"Saw this movie years ago, happy I could see it again, wish it was in color, still enjoyed it as years ago!"
3,"The same CD as the King Biscuit Hour CD, minus 2 tracks","If you already have the King Biscuit Hour CD that is Kansas recorded live in 1989, then you may want to stay away from this CD. It is the same concert, with the same songs as the KB Hour CD minus ""Point of Know Return"", and ""House on Fire"". If you do not have the KB hour CD, then you may be interested in getting this one. Along with the 2 missing tracks from the KB hour CD, it does not have the nice CD sleeve that the KB hour CD has, but if you are just into the music, this CD, if you don't have the other, is a great buy."
5,Great Hat,This is an awesome hat. I love it! I get alot of compliments on it too. The service was awesome and very fast.
2,There are better blow dryers out there,"This is very powerful and dries hair fast. However, it is noisier and heavier than some of the dryers out there. It stopped working after a year also. I felt cheated considering my previous dryer lasted more than 10 years. But it gave me an opportunity to try other dryer. I currently own a Revelon dryer which I'm much happier with."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"I am a diehard EWF fan, and curious, I bought this DVD. It is in fact a compilation of performances, kind of like a 'best of' CD, except all of these performances are available on the other DVDs. There are a few from the Montreux DVD, the Live (1994) DVD, the In Concert 81 DVD, and the Greek Theatre DVD. Nothing new here. Unless you don't want a full concert and just want to see some good clips from already available items, don't buy this, the description is misleading."
4,Influence of Albert Lee is shown,"This recording shows the influence of Clapton bandmate, the brilliant British guitarist Albert Lee, who generally played a ountry guitar style with a jazz edge, but could easily play rock and blues with the same brilliant technical qualityThe songs are varied ranging from country, swing Jazz, rock and blues influences.For the most part, good qualilty non commercial material in a mellow tone.An album to relax to without becoming bored if played to often.Very underated.For songwriting, performance and production it gets an 8/10By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
3,Good mix of rock and blues,"This cd has a lot of pleasant easy-listening radio-friendly super tunes. Nothing vast, but nothing bad. Check out ""Black Rose"", ""I Can't Stand It"", ""Hold Me Lord"", ""Catch Me If You Can"". Bye."
3,Not Worth the Price of Admission,"Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll. His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, ""Reptile,"" makes adult contemporary sound exciting. A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with ""Backless,"" ""Another Ticket,"" and ""Money & Cigarrettes"" all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album. The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow. This is easy listening for classic rock fans."
3,"Not his best, but for collectors","Another Ticket is Claptons last recording with Robert Stigwood before he signs with Reprise Records.There are some good blues efforts on here including, Black Rose, Blow Wind Blow,, And Hold Me Lord.Another Ticket the title cut is the best song on the album.I relate to the lyrics from time to time.""Everytime you think you've paid the price, you turn around and find another ticket"" I Cant Stand it spent some time on the charts.This CD is for Hard Core collectors like myself"
4,Blues and ballads,"This album finds Eric Clapton in comfortable and somewhat familiar territory; he's exploring his blues roots with cuts like the languid ""Floating Bridge"" and the up-tempo Muddy Waters shuffle ""Blow Wind Blow"", while continuing to hone his own abilities as a songwriter. The former he does almost effortlessly, while the latter is a bit more labored. It's true that the opening tune, ""Something Special"" is pleasant enough, and ""I Can't Stand It"", the album's only hit, is solid, but the rest of the originals, possibly save ""Hear Me Lord"", are weak at best. ""Another Ticket"" (the song, not the album), suffers from dated strings that sound out of place and maudlin. And the last two tracks, both originals, are generic and devoid of anything interesting. One of the album's highlights, however, is a wonderful cover of a tune called ""Black Rose."" On this song, lovely acoustic and electric guitars wed to form one of the best tunes on the disc. Not Clapton's best, but a decent enough effort."
5,ANOTHER WINNER,"One of EC's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
2,A great collection of songs with a poor attention to detail.,"A remastered version of this import was enticing. I own the Canadian import but disliked the inferior sound and mix. When I purchased the reissue I was disappointed to find the guitar solo missing from ""Tougher Than The Rest"" and the preamble missing from ""Chimes Of Freedom"". However, the versions of ""Be True"" and ""Born To Run"" are excellent. I wish Columbia had chosen to release the full length version. Stick with the import."
2,Buy the import,"The domestic version is the same as the CD3. The solo in ""Tougher than the Rest"" is edited out and the intro to ""Chimes of Freedom"" is gone. Buy the import, which is the same as the LP and is unedited."
2,tolling for the aching ones,"Bruce brings feeling like he means it to ""Chimes of Freedom."" Feeling behind those words produces great power.The rest of the disc is waste."
3,Flimsy and hard to handle,"This gaffer tape got the job done, but it wasn't nearly as heavy duty as other gaffer tape I've purchased on Amazon. It didn't tear cleanly and it folded over on itself very easily. It seemed thinner than other gaffer tape I've used."
1,Not Sticky,We used several rolls of this at a recent company conference. We had a hard time getting the tape to stick at all.
4,Very easy to apply,"This is very nice tape and easy to apply. I gave it 4 stars only because it wasn't quite as matte as I needed it to be. I was hoping for/needing something that does not reflect but absorbs light. This tape does have some reflection. Other than that, I have never really bought gaffer's tape before, so I can't say how it measures up to other such product."
2,A big dissappointment,"Here is the main point: the game has promising concepts but is poorly executed. The dialogue is mostly emotionally flat. The game was shipped with many bugs, including quiting when trying to finish the 5th major quest, the sound effects are so poorly done as to be annoying. There are balance issues as well, there is no happy median between parts which are too easy and others which are to hard. If they properly patch it and redo all the voice acting and sound effects and the many bugs, then it might be a decent game (in the 3 star range)."
4,Not Deep but Enjoyable,"Well, this game is not what you would call real deep though the plot has good details. Most of the other reviews have addressed the issues of the product both good and bad in one way or another. I would only add the following points:1) I enjoyed the game enough to want to finish it and that says something in today's game market where only about one in ten games is actually worth playing.2) I passed the game on to my eighteen year old grand daughter. She thinks it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Then again, she has been game starved for the last year or so and is just comming out of that GOTH phase.3) Because it is a 2006 game, just about any PC people own will play it today, including those 300$ laptops people are snapping up so no issues with minimum requirements for this one.We all know there is down time while we wait for the next game on our list of desires. In this period we look for something to fill the void. This is a good choice for that.Hail Flavius!"
4,Nice looking girls what else you could ask?,"I think WT3 is a pretty decent movie, much better than the second, but don't expect a clever movie cause you'll be disappointed. The plot doesn't differ too much from the first movie, a man accused of raping a young girl plus the difficult relationship with his step daughter (Sarah Laine) with the diamonds in the middle. The low class girl in interpreted by Sarah McCoy as Neve Campbell did that role in the first. Both girls are very good looking especially, Laine. There's treason, blackmail and a well-thought scheme (at least in the minds of the characters). The revealing ending shows with flashbacks during the credits the key points of the plot, a surprising finale that is hard to anticipate. If you like the first movie, you'll like the third one."
3,not sure,I'm not really sure what to say about this movie except I don't know about waisting time? I don't even know if it is possible to waist time. Do you need a belt for that waist? I'm pretty sure waist can not be a verb in any way except I think I just wasted my time writing this whole thing.
2,Pornography,"This is a pretty bad movie. The acting is mediocre, the plot is recycled from Wild Things 1 and 2 (as previous reviewers mentioned). The only thing this movie is good for is a lonely night when your only companion is a tube of KY Jelly. After the initial threesome, the only thing the two starlets seem to do is make out, including an additional topless make-out scene after during the end credits.Also, the way the doctor talks about himself in the third person is hilarious. Seriously. If you don't have a case of serious blue-balls, but want a good laugh, rent this movie."
2,hardly worth one scene,"a boxed set with 3 discs in slim cases. the first movie is unrated and the other two are ""r"" ratings. the first movie is relatively clever with the one menage a trois scene, which is good. it also had a theatrical release. the other two movies follow the same plot, and same one menage a trois scene done worse and worse. seeing three movies milk one scene isn't worth the price of the discs. if you're into seductive type movies, check out the ""poison ivy"" series. they have much more to offer."
3,Accidental Porn,"I caught this movie late one night, and if I didn't know better I would have pegged it as an average cable 'adult film'. I liked Wild Things 1, and I was mildly entertained by the sequel, but this one is pretty much just the softcore porn version. I mean i've seen movies MEANT to spoof this type of theme, and they weren't nearly as rediculous as this. I'm giving it 3 stars though, because as softcore porn, it wasn't half bad."
3,"No dvd, but good service",The vendor emailed me to say that the dvd was out of stock and refunded my purchase price.
3,wild things 3 -diamonds in the rough,"This was more developed,the actors were more deeper. the plot was more developed. But it could have been hotter!!"
1,No more please,"I thought they were going to just call it quits on Wild Things 2, but they really had to make a thrid one!!! I was just curious so I rented it one night and I thought the acting was just bad enough. I fell asleep though this one just like wild things 2. Don't waist your time!"
4,3 In 1,I love the fact that I got such a great deal on three movies. packaging them in a bu ndle definitely saves on space and plastic. great movies! definitely recommend buying movies and music on amazon.
3,This item was Abridged!,"I was very disappointed to find that this is in fact the abridged version of Pompeii, not the ""Unabridged Audio CD Collector's Edition"" as advertised."
4,Pompeii fizzles,"A fascinating look at the ancient city of Pompeii, but it seemed rather dull at times. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about Rome's aqueduct system. One would think the eruption of Vesuvius would merit more than just a glancing treatment. Somewhat disappointing, but still a good read."
3,just ok,"so i purchased `pompeii' at the airport for some light travel reading, on the strength of ellipse-filled but positive reviews on the cover from respected rags including the NY Times and The Economist, ""terrific..gripping..."" etc. it performed well-enough, though not as good as the reviews indicated; it feels a little formulaic, thrown together and ultimately flat. the pages keep turning at a reasonable pace, but i kept having a certain `color by numbers' feeling not unlike reading the machine-produced recent novels from tom clancy. i'm obviously no connoisseur of the light fiction genre, but i'd have to recommend `da vinci code' or katherine neville's excellent `the eight' long before i'd tell anyone to buy this. the one thing from this novel worth thinking about, with my own ellipsis: harris clearly has an undue influence on the biggest reviewing publications in the world...."
5,Fascinating and informative,"I think this book is a terrific read. Great description, characters, well written. I thought I knew the history of Pompeii - I learned so much more! I have recommended this book to several friends, and gave a few copies as gifts. I will definitely add Robert Harris to my list of authors and look for more of his books."
4,Finally a great book by Harris,"Having read all of Robert Harris' books, Pompeii is the best of the lot.His other books, though tantalizing in range and idea often fall flat by the end, but using the backdrop of the eruption of Vesuvius in CE 79, Harris has finally reached the summit.It starts slowly, but builds to a believable crescendo and does not leave you wanting.Once the novel picks up speed, there is little you can do to keep from turning its pages.Even if you are not interested with ancient Rome, you will find the story enjoyable and approachable and most importantly original."
3,Pompeii,"I read this book on a flight over to Italy, so I was up to date with the story and history of Pompeii"
4,Almost As Good in Foreplay as In the Climax,"Robert Harris' Pompeii delivers even before Vesuvius lets loose. The story of the Aquarius Attilius has a double does of forboding, one of which the character is aware (that something suspicious is going on with a missing Aquarius and questions about the water supply, a nice Chinatown the movie touch lending a degree of noir charm to the book) and one of which the reader is very clearing aware and the author makes clear at the beginning of each chapter (the imminent explosion of the volcano). When said event does happen, all hell breaks loose and all stray bits of plot come together very nicely. Pliny makes an inevitable, yet very effective, appearance. If there ever is to be a noir-historical-disaster novel genre, let this book set its standard."
3,Secondary Characters and Setting Keep It Going,"Pompeii is an entertaining novel with a bare bones plot and a small number of characters. The description of Pompeii and the surrounding area, the discussion of the Aqua Augusta, and the rendition of Vesuvious erupting is excellent.However, the main character - Attilius - and his love interest are rather bland and one dimensional. A serious flaw - to have a main character and a love story poorly developed and of little interest to the reader.The secondary characters are fabulous though - Pliny the Elder, the bad guy Ampliatus, Brebix the gladiaitor, the short scene with a prostitute and the ""never seen"" Exomnius. These are just some examples.One final flaw - the book ends with a whimper and not a bang. Almost as if the deadline was up and the author just tied all loose ends together and submitted the work.I do recommend the novel though. The novel is well written and for all it flaws it is as they say: ""a good read""."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I won't go into the details of the plot itself. The professional and readers' reviews on this page do that. I want to comment on the flow of the plot and the characters which inhabit it. This book moves very slowly. There is very little tension. What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that? There can be no real resolution of these matters because the reader knows that virtually everyone in the town of Pompeii will soon die when the volcano erupts. The characters might have been able to carry the reader along if they had been interesting, exciting people. But, they are cliches. The completely evil villain; the sad, ever moral good guy. And they talk and talk and talk. Until the last third of the book, there is virtually no action in this supposed thriller. If you want a fast paced novel with vivid characters, you might want to look elsewhere."
4,Takes you Right There,"First of all, let me say that if you are fortunate enough to have ever walked the streets of Pompeii, you will love this book. For those of you who have never seen it for yourself, or have not had an obsessive interest, you may want to pass.I LOVED this story. Robert Harris captures the last hours of one of the most glorious and corrupt cities in ancient Rome. The main character, Attilius, is working to find what has caused the failure of the aqueduct. He finds it in pompeii 2 days before the eruption of Vesuvius. From the heartbreaking prophecy of the city's fame to the final 2 minutes of destruction, Harris somehow manages to place you in the middle of all the action. I actually cried."
3,Not As Good as Imperium,"Robert Harris's ""Imperium"" is one of the finest historical fiction novels that I have ever read. So it was with some anticipation that I picked his his earlier novel, ""Pompeii"". This novel had all the ingredients to be successful. The destruction of Pompeii, details on the Roman system of aqueducts and the presence of Pliny the Elder. Who could ask for more?But in the end, I was reminded of Tony Curtis' performance in the movie Spartacus. You could put Curtis in a Roman toga and give him leather sandals but in the end it was the Bronx born Tony Curtis speaking his lines on the screen. This novel has all the superficial trappings of good historical fiction but in the end, there was a contemporary sensibility that ruined this book. It is as though modern characters were taken back two thousand years and inhabit the bodies of ancient Romans. Not recommended."
2,Very disappointing considering,"The book started out okay, but went down hill from there. I don't think characters and plot lines were developed as well as they could have been. Very disappointing considering how interesting the subject matter is. I found my mind wandering countless times while reading the book. It almost became a chore to pick it up where I left off. I just felt like something was missing throughout the read. I definitely do not recommend it."
3,"A good, mediocre read","I liked Robert Harris' Pompeii. I read it in a few days, enjoyed it, and found the story to be well written. But - there is a but - it could be boring at times. It was definitely not the 5* nocel I had expected it to be. Anyway, I loved the ancient setting in the Roman city of Pompeii with all it's hustlers, decadent senators, prostitutes, slaves and gladiators. The main character is the young engineer Marcus, who has travelled from Rome to take over the job as water-engineer in the area around Pompeii. He soon discovers that something is wrong, and the story takes place on this the last days of Pompeii. Will Marcus get out of the city before the volcano erupts? Will he be able to save the girl he can't stop thinking about? Will he find out what happened to the missing water-engineer of Pompeii? The novel is full of interesting questions plus a good deal of 'lessons' about volcanoes, earthquakes and so on. A fairly good read, entertaing."
2,A bland writing style hampers a fine tale,"From the pedestrian dialogue to the adequate prose, Harris attaches lots of research. But there's a reason he opens each chapter with quotes from texts on volcanoes. He's too inadequate an author to incorporate this material into the actual text. No Leon Uris he! All the characters are cardboard with the possible exception of Pliny, but Pliny's views as expressed here on sexuality do not seem bona fide. Additionally, the hero's behavior and thoughts are inconsistent. A better writer would have used this book as an outline for a much richer work. The basics are here, but little else. Don't be surprised to find yourself skimming towards the end."
2,A Hollywood B Movie,"Pompeii was the first Harris novel I have read. I had looked forward to it based on some reviews only to be disappointed. He did a fine job with the historical and scientific material, but his plot was no better than the plots of Hollywood B movies of the 1940's and 50's. The central character, the young aqueduct engineer, was able to go without sleep or food for three days and survive the fantastic forces of the eruption of Vesuvius - more than once! Moreover, the moral stance of the novel is that it really did not matter what happened to all the other people in the path of the eruption - not just vile former slave now rich and manipulative land owner - as long as the young engineer rescued the young woman he met briefly just two days before the catastrophe. I think Harris really knows what are the geophysical consequences of a volcanic eruption, but not the human, and that is a serious fault as his central theme is the human response to the eruption."
2,Drama & disaster dulled,"How is it possible for an author to take one of the most dramatic and destructive natural disasters in Western History and render it so flat and lifeless? One-dimensional characters are the problem. Harris's people have no personalities and no nuance; they wander through a book that has the formal tone and stilted style of '50s gladiator movies. The only way to read this book is on fast-forward. Or better, wait for the movie."
4,Pompeii by Robert Harris,"For the most part, I enjoyed the book and learned a lot about this period in time. There were a few instances in the book that I didn't enjoy reading, but otherwise, it was good."
4,"Suspenseful, riveting",I love intelligent thrillers and this certainly fit the bill. It's a tension-filled countdown to the eruption of Vesuvius.Who will survive? Will the evil Ampliatus continue his reign? What happened to the former aquarius Exomnious? These are all questions that will gnaw at you until the very end.
5,Pompeii by Robert Harris,"I actually read this book for a class. It's a novel, very enjoyable, but is also an excellent introduction to Roman life at the time of the eruption. At least one of the characters, Pliny, really lived, and the others seem real. A very enjoyable read."
4,Fascinating and accurate telling of end of Pompeii,"Harris approaches his subject from an interesting angle. The hero is an engineer assigned to care for the water lines, reservoirs, and aqueducts which served Pompeii and a number of other towns in ancient Roman Italy. The young engineer shows up to take up the position left vacant by the previous, and missing, aquarius. Attilius is almost immediately saddled with a disaster: the aqueduct fails, and people begin to go thirsty. He must discover why the aqueduct has failed, what has happened to the previous aquarius and what to do with the daughter of a local former slave who has become the richest man in the area with a cruel streak to match his great wealth. Attilius must juggle all of this while he begins to realize that the water problems are somehow related to a reawakening of the volcano Vesuvius.The book is quick paced, well written, suspenseful, and very enjoyable!"
4,Harris' Pompeii delights and captivates,"What a great read. Harris delivers a wonderful reading experience in Pompeii. The story of young engineer Marcus Attilius is certainly plausible.Young Attilius takes over responsibility of the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that delivers water to Pompeii and other cities in and around the Bay of Naples. When the small city of Misenum stops receiving water via the aqueduct young Attilius convinces Pliny the Elder to let him investigate. When Attilius arrives at Vesuvius he realizes that much more than water delivery is at stake.Thrown against the background of history, Harris manages to spin a story of human interest that is at once captivating. Against the history of the time Harris develops characters that are immediately believable and sheds light on a culture that is doomed both immediately and in the longterm. His writing is economical which is refreshing.A very intriguing story that is well researched. You won't be sorry you read it."
3,The best from Harris...,"His other books are somewhat wooden, and by demanding of themselves circuitous plots, work themselves into a uniform level of intensity. This book is a simpler story, with fewer twists and subterfuges, and as a result, it breathes reality and human energies where Harris' other books seem almost computer-generated in contrast. Yes, all familiar themes are rehashed here; it is done well. The author's insights onto history are both hackneyed and refreshing. It's not Hemingway but it's a good read."
3,Fortune favors the brave!,"Pompeii is in the tradition of the best historical novel. Set right in the period of time right before and through the eruption of Vesuvius, Pompeii is told from the point of view of the water engineer for a nearby town.Harris portrays a period in Roman history. He has done enough research to make the people and their culture come to life. His writing is adequate to the task but not brilliant--but who cares--this book is a lot of fun and a quick read!"
3,Corrupt Eruption,"Painstaking historical research brought to life in novel form. The main character is an engineer called in to repair an aqueduct.Stuff about volcanic eruptions and decadent Romans vomitting at feasts so they can stuff themselves again -- this was obviously before the Atkins Diet! The point of this seems to be poetic irony -- the Romans 'erupt' then are erupted on! And, furthermore, since they're so decadent to just use food hedonistically, they are clearly guilty of the classical sin of hubris, so the eruption is supposed to be a kind of divine retribution, giving this blind act of natural violence some moral dimension. These are the literary fireworks that Harris has clumsily tried to embed in the text.In a nutshell this is regurgitated, pre-chewed history for the easy consumption of those who haven't quite developed their own historical molars."
3,Should Have Been Better,"Harris does a wonderful job of putting the reader into the everyday life of the Roman world. There is none of the stilted dialogue of so many historical novels, and his settings are vividly clear. The problem is with the peripheral characters, particularly Corelia. Throughout the book you get no feel for who she is or why she and the main character, based on just two brief encounters, should be so attracted as to risk their lives (first she, then he) for each other. The suspense and narrative could have held the reader long enough for Harris to spend a bit of time developing his characters."
4,Weak plot but excellent scientific description.,I am going to visit Pompeii and I wanted a description of the eruption.The plot was all right and didn't get in the way of the excellent description of the human disaster.
5,One of the Best Books I Have Ever Read,"If you only read one book a year, this is the book to read. It is gripping, riveting, exciting and steeped in fact, but veiled in fiction. This huge volcano that erupted in Italy may be ready to erupt again, so definitely read ""Pompeii"" before you take a trip to Italy, it will bring to life the amazing history of the place."
3,Not Explosive Enough!!,"Pompeii, is set, as you can probably guess, in the last few days, before the destruction of that town, by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in 79 A.D. I felt, the author's attention to detail was very good, but that some of the characters were a bit one-dimensional. A lot of time was spent on the build up to the eruption, but I felt the author did not spend enough time on the actual town of Pompeii. A lot of the book is set in the surrounding towns. Overall though, not a bad read."
4,making hydralic engineers sexy,Interesting view of how Romans lived just before Pompeii blew. The explination of how water was moved great distances duing a time when many people think there wasn't much in the way of technology. To calculate the drop over run sufficent to move water at just the correct rate was indeed a great piece of engineering. Oh by the way the love story isn't all the bad either.
4,Good Read,"The author knows how to build excitement and develop interesting characters. This is difficult to do in a short, action book.Those who enjoy novels by Stephen Saylor will like this book too."
5,Fun mystery story,"This is a mystery story set in AD 79, just days before Mount Vesuvius buried Pompeii in a volcanic eruption. The new Aquarius (water engineer) of the area must find out what happened to his predecessor, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace. Meanwhile, he is vexed by a strange interruption to the water flow in the aquaduct, and a mystery of poisoned fish. Very fast paced, suspenseful, with good historical detail. It is like the movie ""Titanic"" in that you know the coming disaster, but not whether the characters will survive."
4,an interesting read,"pompeii was my first robert harris book.i found the story interesting, nail biting, and sometimes funny, overall, it's a very well written novel."
3,"It's ""Titanic"", but with a volcano instead of an iceberg.","This is a decent enough historical potboiler, though. The writing is lively and pulls the reader along, and the expository dialog is reasonably well crafted. The engineering accounts of the aqueducts are either fascinating or boring, depending on your bent (I found them fascinating). The account of the eruption fits well with contemporary accounts and excavated evidence. Overall I enjoyed it for what it was. If you're looking for ""War and Peace"", go buy that instead. But if you'd like to imagine what it must have been like to live through this event, this is pretty good."
3,Beware: the recording is abridged.,"This happens all too frequently with audio recordings. I've reported this fact to Amazon.com before, but the listings always remain unchanged. This audio recording is abridged. The slipcase says ""THIS ABRIDGMENT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE AUTHOR."" The written novel is superb and the reading is very well done. But it's not unabridged and it should not be advertised as such."
4,A deep subject mixed with shallow characters,"Granted, the author's characterizations weren't deep, but I don't think that was his intent. He wanted to bring the eruption to life (!) by showing the events surrounding it. An excellent rendition.Water flows changed by earth movements? Right on! Blind optimism in the face of disaster? Right on! It can't happen here? Right on!The author provides an excellent insight into the life and times of the period. This is a novel about history, not a novel about people. Although the people aren't ignored.I found the book very fascinating."
2,a little disappointing,"Unfortunately, the book neither gives adequate information about the life of the people at the time, nor is the information about the Roman aqueducts really coherent. So, itb seems to me,this book is neither fish nor fowl.It is simply very superficial!It is still interesting and easy reading, only, after you've finished, you do not really know, why you read it."
1,Just one word...,I chose this book for a book review for my humanities class. The absolute BEST review I can give it is exceedingly tedious. It was a monstrous waste of my time and effort.
1,Dull,"I read ""Fatherland"" and liked it. Terrific premise--that Hitler had not lost WWII--and reasonably well-made characters.Then I read ""Enigma"" and hated it. I kept expecting it to get better. It never did. Unlike ""Fatherland,"" ""Enigma"" merely stuck to facts--the breaking of the German code in WWII. The characters were lifeless and the plot a snore.""Pompeii"" is more like ""Enigma""--no messing with actual history; just a fictional rendition of it.And it is equally dull. I teach Latin, so I know the history and the details. The fictional characters are one-dimensional at best; more like zero-dimensional. They are predictable and uninteresting. And the plot, of course, is known beforehand. The romance has no sparks.If you want to learn some history, this book will teach you. But as a novel it is dry, dry, dry."
3,Roman water works boss turns volcanologist/sleuth,"This 3.5 star story is set in the region around Pompeii just a couple of days before the volcano Vesuvius buries it. The protagonist, an 'aquarius' - works for the water department in Rome and is sent to investigate a problem with the aquaduct system near the city identified in the book title.He encounters disgruntled laborors, corrupt city officials, scholars, and a love interest.Harris does a good job of describing the lives of people from various stations of life in the Empire, especially the 'lower' positions. He portreys things that are different - technology, food, views of the worth of the individual - and the things that remain the same - greed, snobbery, government bureaucracy, violence and powermongering.I found it even more interesting for the picture of ancient Rome that it paints than the plot, but the story moves along well, keeps you turning the pages and comes together quite well."
4,Pompeii in Audio CD format,"I actually liked this audio version. It was very well narrated. Very detailed in its description of life in Pompeii during the time.I wish the author would have concentrated more on the actual volcano eruption rather than on the problem encountered with the aquaduct but then I realize that the aquaduct was his main theme for the book. Also, I wish there would have been more details regarding the characters. The female character was hardly explored and also her connection to the main character.Overall, I did enjoy the novel very much..."
4,A Fast and Fun Read for Ancient History Fans,"I read this one in one night and enjoyed it greatly. There's an action packed plot--politics, greed, and a lovely romance all move it right along plus there is lots of accurate historical detail regarding the eruption of Vesuvius. The author puts you right in the thick of it in the days leading up to the eruption. The reader knows what is coming but the characters in the novel don't....very exciting--fast paced and an absorbing read."
4,If You Love Historical Fiction and Thrillers,"If you love history, thrillers, human drama, this is a very good book. The research is impeccable, the action very strong, the characters interesting. I read voraciously and just finished Pompeii; Isaac's Storm, about the Galveston hurricane in 1900 (excellent); and James Dalessandro's 1906, about the great San Francisco Earthquake, which I discovered after reading a review on Bookideas.com. I highly recommend all three, particularly 1906, which is one of the best novels I have read in years."
5,"a quick, pleasurable read","I started this on the plane coming from NYC and finished it just landing in Atlanta. I found it to have an interesting level of historical detail, which provided an anchor point for the rather formulaic plot (ethical young engineer v. corrupt older businessman; romance btw said engineer, and, you guessed it, the businessman's daughter). Well written."
5,A Great Adventure... and he was the first!,"Not having seen the DVD (but keen to do so now!) I can say that this treatment of the story of the first men to drive coast-to-coast is a good one. Jackson and Crocker set off from California to New York in 1903 in an auto which only vaguely resembles the sophisticated machines of today and across a nation which depended on railroads for serious travel. Roads in most of the country were rarely, if ever maintained and some were still like the old wagon trails pioneers traveled on only a few decades before. It was an adventure and one which the two men (and their dog Bud) rose to the challenge, manhandling their machine through rough patches and mud, struggling to find gasoline where no such infrastructure existed and crossing America few would ever see. Well worth a read."
5,A Terrific Almanac of Travel--Very Useful,"This is a wonderful book, but Amazon's got it wrong. It's by Arthur Frommer himself. Not by George McDonald.It delves into all facets of the travel industry except for the traditional or conventional forms of travel. It's for people with adventurous spirits who want to find out learn a foreign language while traveling, or do volunteer work abroad, or visit an intentional community. A fascinating book with lots of good ideas."
1,Tweety seat cover review,"I really like the bright yellow, but it's already wearing on the seat from my clothing. I don't think it's going to last long. It's getting those wear bumps from my jeans and turning dark on the yellow. I wish I would of gotten black."
5,Surprisingly good - i missed out first time round,"I found this album by accident: having heard ""Oliver's Army"" I wanted a copy, so I got the album from the library. I was surprised at the range of tracks, I had always thought of Elvis Costello as being a bit ""uncool"". However, the album contains all sorts of gems, from the tubthumping ""Oliver's Army"" to the more mellow ""Good Year for the Roses"", and what about the aching ""I Want You""? As I'm only 21 I missed these songs when they were first released, and I feel quite deprived! Having listened to this album I was inspired to get Costello's ""Brutal Youth"" CD. It's also a classic, with that unmistakeable sound in a truly contemporary twist. I really would recommend this to anyone who wants something that will surprise them - it's great!"
4,Cranberry Juice and Soda,"I ran into Elvis @ LAX several months ago. I was in a vitriolic mood and returned the tape (Spyke) I'd been listening to all week on the Central Coast in my renta car. So while I was smoking a cigareet outside the terminal, the big limo pulls up and out falls a phalnyx of Elvis' employees. I think maybe it was just the way his entourage was kind of choreographed plus a bad week in Santa Barbara, put me in a foul mood. But fortunately, at the Airlines Club, Elvis was at the center of the bar ordering Cranberry Juice and soda. I decided to adjust my attitude and I asked the bartender to find out if Elvis would take a second, which he did with considerable courtesy. It's really cool to see how courteous this guy can be. Don't forget what he's done for other artists, like Roger McGuinn. What was way cool was that remembering all those lyrics,was, he told me, like doing crossword puzzles. Hope Elvis next collaborator is Van Morrison."
2,David Lee Roth was Right,Elvis Costello is a Alright Song-Writer but on a Whole Very Overrated.David Lee ROth was Right The Only Reason Why Critics Dug Elvis Costello was Because He Looked Like Them.His Music is Nothing Special.Alison is a Good Song.but his Music on a Whole is Not all that Original.
4,A great collection that can get newcomers interested.,"Having used to own this (I believe when I was maybe 13 or 14 years old), I feel it fair to give my long-overdue insight on this collection of Elvis Costello's early work. I really do like every track on the CD, and they collectively give the listener a really great, but not perfect, look at the first ten years of Costello's music career. There are definitely some better collections of his early works out there, but you can only represent any one album so much on a single CD that represents 10 albums.Overall, this is an excellent collection, but I think it would helpful to maybe listen to a greater variety of Costello's songs on YouTube or the equivalent, and decide whether you want to buy this album, buy a more extensive collection, or download a variety of individual tracks to make your own Elvis Costello collection. The last option is what I myself ended up doing."
4,"Good, but....","This is actually an excellent collection, but I would get the 2-disc ""Very Best Of Elvis Costello"" myself. It's pretty much identical, and alot more affordable."
3,expanded--yet EDITED songs from original pressing!,"Well, if you already have the original US pressing of this CD, you're in for a little shock here. Sure, it has a bunch of remixes and bonus tracks, but in order to cram those songs onto here, they have taken the 12"" versions of Some Girls and Strike it Rich and edited them! Some Girls is now a little over 4 minutes verses its near 6 minute version, and Strike it Rich has gone from 6 minutes to under 3 minutes!!! Oh well, guess I'll be keeping two versions of this CD. For those who are wondering, The reissues of Deep Sea Skiving, Bananarama and True Confessions do NOT edit any of the original songs, yet still manage to squeeze on a load of bonus tracks."
5,As I Grew...,"I grew up with Bananarama's Wow! playing on car trips to cottages. I knew all the words to all ten songs and bopped along constantly.Lately, though I am a metal-head, I've rediscovered Wow! and I love it! The songs get stuck in my head for days, and I found myself singing ""I Can't Help it"" as I wrote an exam today."
3,Bad For Me,"I have to say this album didn't WOW me. I didn't like it when it came out and I don't like it now. I love Banarama, don't get me wrong. There are good tracks on here. All of the good one's were released as singles. So best just to pick up the Best Of collection. Stike It Rich is a great track just too long. This CD came on the heals of True Confessions. With that album they tried to go in more of a serious direction probably because of Siobhan. This time it just feels like they were trying too hard to capture what they had before.It sounds overproduced. Siobhan soon jumped ship after this one. I look forward to their latest release ""Drama."" It has a few updated versions of some Banana classics! Siobahn's latest single is called Bad Blood. It's amazing!"
2,Not this time,"I adored Liz Ireland's previous book and was eagerly looking forward to this one.What a letdown. It felt to me as though this storyline was simply recycled from a mish-mash of previous chick lits. Basic storyline: girl likes guy - guy is clueless - girl gets job at publishing house - girl is clueless about most things in her life.Sorry, but this book just did not do it for me at all. I did not like the characters, the writing was boring and the story felt as though it just went on and on and on..."
5,Fantasy Lives!,"Nalini Singh has created compelling and believeable characters in her debut novel DESERT WARRIOR. This brilliantly crafted tale suspended reality for me and brought back the old Valentino style sweep-you-off-your-feet Sheik romance. Ms Singh has a wonderful lyrical writing style with a deeply sensual promise for readers. While DESERT WARRIOR certainly wasn't the kind of read I was expecting in a Sil. Desire, I was gripped from start to finish by this truly enjoyable book. I look forward to her next title with great impatience."
4,.,"The most interesting part of this book was the leading lady's secret. I stuck with it to find out what it was...and then I found out and it was nothing. The build up to the reveal and the reveal itself was anticlimactic.I love Singh, though. I forgive her."
3,Wonderfully,"This was the second novel I have read of Ms. Singh and just like the other novel this one showed the full love of both hero and heroine right away. In the usual romance the hero waits to the last minute to tell her his true feelings but not in this title.I also liked the great sex scenes not as good as ""awaken to pleasure"" but good enough. I love that the author showed how hurt the sheik was after being left years ago by Jasmine and how she had to fight to show him this time around she will never desert him again. Very touching and heart wrenching especially after finding out how her family wanted the ""the other sister"" to have him instead of her. Great read."
4,Quite good,"I'm a great fan of Nalini Singh's PSY series, so this book was a complete surprise for me, but I'm not sorry that I read it. The story of a mighty prince and his wife was fun - nothing special, but I liked it. The characters are not as interesting as in Nalini Singh's later books - the prince is annoying with his unreasonable jealousy and she seems really naive and definitely too sweet. Still, I enjoyed it."
2,wobbles a lot,"The board is light, easy to setup/store; however, it is extremely wobbly: if pressure is applied to it (usual when one irons), the legs stretch a bit further apart and the whole board goes down as a result (a few inches). In addition, it topples over quite easily, since the legs or not sturdy and wobble. So, if you look for a cheap board to iron the occasional item, the board is ok, but don't expect good craftsmen-ship."
2,Flimsy packaging,"This ironing board is strictly for light duty. The first one arrived damaged and with the packaging split open, mainly due to the flimsy packaging. After notifying Crazy Daves, and multiple followups, they sent a replacement (at no charge). It arrived in much better condition, though the packaging was again split open in several places. My suggestion is they revise the packaging to make it more sturdy to protect the product."
1,cheap arrived in poor condition,"This ironing board is cheap and arrived in poor condition, torn with a missing piece on the ironing board leg and it was very wobbly."
2,Basic only,"You should know that ironing is my favorite household chore and that my old ironing board, which I loved but couldn't replace because it was no longer made, collapsed (literally) after years of sometimes daily service. That said, I give this new board an adequate score. It is rather flimsy and unstable on my tile floors. Perhaps it would be better on a carpeted surface. If you just need something basic, it is fine. Otherwise, keep looking."
3,Gets the job done,"For the price of the product it gets the job done. It gets three stars for that. It is however flimsy or not quite solid. The top pad suface is totally minimal, I'd suggest getting padding for it, unless you can afford a high end model instead. But again, it gets the job done."
3,Light and easy,Light and easy to move around in a tiny laundrey. I can't lift heavy thngs and don't do much ironing so it really fits my purposes.
2,A very tedious book,"I truly wanted to read The Pride, so much that I forced myself to get through half the novel before I abandoned it. Mr. Ford writes lovely prose and can turn a phrase. Unfortunately, this novel is bogged down with tedious character development and a plodding storyline. It takes the first hundred pages or so to get several characters to a decedent's memorial service. Then, the next 1/3 of the book is spent over a luncheon meeting. Before the lunchgoers had finished their meal, I was completely tired of them and their business deliberations. I had no interest in continuing."
5,Fabulous reference,Giddins' book is invaluable as a reference and extremely readable. This is a book I often pull off the shelf after listening to an artist on CD and use it to read the background on that particular jazz performer. It is organized in a way that allows for that but is equally enjoyable to read from cover to cover. Very well writen and enjoyable. Deserves a place in the library of any jazz lover.
1,love -a serious business,"love is the other side of hate - intense and unforgettable. still it's better to love and not to love, for in loving we learn much about ourselves."
1,Perhaps the worst royal documentary...ever,"This documentary features one of my smug countrymen who sneers his way through the segments about Queen Elizabeth II, continually asking snide rhetorical questions like ""why on earth would a nation still have a royal family"" and similar comments. National Geographic chose to contrast the British monarchy with a set of third world monarchies (Uganda, Nepal and Tonga I think) in what seems to be a deliberate attempt to further belittle Queen Elizabeth, the British people who like the monarchy, and building up an idea that republicanism is rampant in the UK when in fact it hovers in the 20% range for years. Its too bad and doesn't reflect well on National Geographic."
3,Ehh,This DVD is a bit misleading. I love learning about all the royal families around the world but of course like many royal watchers my favorites are the Windsors of Great Britain. This DVD has Prince William and Prince Harry on the cover but it actually talks more about an african royal family that I knew nothing about. I watched it for the educational value but it was a bit disappointing simply because I didnt get what i thought i was getting. It was just ok as far as I was concerned.
4,Last Royals,Very well made documentary. Good to see a more comprehensive story on royal families across the globe. Well done National Geographic!!
4,Not as Good as Das Testament,"I don't think this CD is as good as Das Testament, by itself. But if you were to listen to that and then this CD it would be good. Why? Because this is like a break from all that growling.Its a very calm CD compared to the other one. Still good. But would probably be better to someone who liked soothing sort of music.Well, none the less, I'll have translations up for this CD on my website (http://www.enomineforus.tk) by the end of this week for those of you who don't speak German."
5,A must have in any collection,This CD the music is rich. I loved every song on it. It is really great to relax to or have on while you sleep.I play it lots. Its great music to create to as it invokes lots of different moods.
5,wrath,"For those who think God is nothing but Love, this is an excellent eye opener, sort of like Lewis' ""Screwtape Letters"", a ""new"" perspective for some."
3,sinners in the hands of an angry GOD,"Its the first time i have read a book by this author edwardswrites well and truthfully. but the book i got was not a book it was a booklet with 27 pages.The add did not say booklet so not able to comment on overall content,but yes ill buy from his writings again but this time ill make sure that it is a book and not booklet very dissapointed about that .1 i would want to know that it was a booklet and alittle more about the authour"
1,A Sad Commentary,"Hopefully, Jonathan Edwards' sermon will soon be relegated to its proper place in history: an interesting insight into the pathological need for fear-mongering in religions and the psychotic nature of many religious beliefs."
5,Grace!!,"All I see in this sermon is grace! God's wrath is what it is, and is not changed because we do not like it. But, we have been told to flee from the wrath to come, and cannot blame the messenger! Once we have been given grace, this sermon deepens our love for Christ, Who saved us from such a terrible fate!"
5,Excellent HOB Filter,I have been using the Whisper filters for several years now. I have two of the 60's and they do an excellent job. They are reliable and easy to maintain.
5,Voted #1 by listeners of WUMB Boston 1998 Top 100,"After listening patiently for 5 days for my local folk station to count down from 100, I remember feeling a bit disappointed and righteously indignant when my favorite album, Circles and Arrows hadn't been played by number 10. ""Driving Home"" made the list at number 9...I should have had more faith....This collection still reigns as my favorite of all time and it is obvious that I was not alone. Cheryl's songwriting talent is beautifully showcased in this work. From ""Arrow"" and her story of a heart waiting to find a home, to ""Estate Sale"", she tells us once again that humanity is well.... human. Her haunting delivery of the sound of a broken heart in ""Aces"" and ""Don't Wanna"" is another testament to the power of her lyrics.This is an album that brings contemporary folk music to those who never knew the genre would speak to their souls or tickle their funny bones."
5,Circles & Arrows,Wheeler is the best contemporary song writer and singer of our day! Absolutely great!
5,A classic!,"This excellent album is the best one this brilliant singer/songwriter has ever put out. With songs ranging from the beautiful (Moonlight and Roses, Aces) to the amusing (Estate Sale) to the heartwrenching (Arrow), Ms. Wheeler covers all the bases and delivers an album that is positively luminous. Don't miss it!"
2,Music for the co-dependant crowd,"Other than a lack of vocal range, limited guitar skills and monotonous songs that stick to whining about how lonely she is there isn't any way to fault Wheeler. ""I wish I could Faaaaallll in love..."" Uh, Cheryl, maybe if you stopped whining. Pedestrain. She's a much better comedianne than performer or writer."
3,"Not bad, but could be improved","The Snugride was the only infant seat we could find that would install securely in the middle of the backseat of our Subaru Forester with a seatbelt. I've always felt that the seat was secure, but I haven't felt the same about my baby in the seat. The headrest was all but useless. It was too large and our baby's head would flop to the side or forward when he fell asleep. We ended up purchasing a different headrest to use. Another negative for us was the weight of the carrier. It was incredibly heavy compared to others, which made toting around an 18 lb baby a chore. And I don't think the weight was because of cushioning or padding because there was very little of it, which makes extended car trips a bit uncomfortable. Compared to the Primo Viaggo, which we use in my in-laws' car, the Snugride is inferior."
3,"Don't buy this, you'll never get a matching stroller","*Update on 10/13: The ivy league stroller has been discontinued*This infant seat is really nice and sturdy. No regrets at all. I'd give a 5 for the seat alone. When I bought this, the matching stroller was available but thought I'd buy it a week later. Now it's 2 months and I can't find the matching stroller in any of the toyrus or babiesrus stores, and ofcourse none online (you can check for it even now).I believe they stopped production on this, and the customer service in both these shops simply cannot give a date when they'd get stocks :(Better buy a travel system, incase you still decide on this, make sure you check the availability of the stroller."
5,"Although, Jordan hasn't been in it I love it.","Our second son was born 9 weeks too early and is still in the hospital. But should be coming home very soon. Anyway, I love this carseat. I love the look, and it is great for our little Ivy League. I love the pattern and colors. I can't wait for Jordan to sit in it."
4,exceptional speaker at this price,"I hooked this enormous speaker up to my 50 watt reciever.They have ample bass ...But i wouldnt suggest these speakers for a 3 piece system(reciever,speaker pair)because there are virtually no mids and the highs are really flat sounding.The speakers still sound this way when the treble is all the way up.I also warn people on trying to bridge these speakers i use 50 watt amp so i tried it and its not a wise idea.All in all these speakers are great at their price but the sound is mainly for the bass lovers.Add a set of mid to high bookshelf speakers and its a system that is unrivaled at this price."
4,KHL AV5001 Floor standing speaker,"I purchased a pair of these speakers via Amazon.com (best price)in December 2001. I have enjoyed them very much. I use them with a high power Sony reciever for watching DVDs and for all types of rock and rap music. The bass is so deep and clean that I nolonger need my self-powered sub-base speaker unit. You are not going to beat them for the price. The particle board cabinet is covered with a very very thin black wood grain decal that does not stick to all the corners perfectly. I just blew out one of the speakers by playing really a loud super low bass disc. It still works, but is rattling. Now I will see how that 5 year unconditional warranty works:) I highly recomend these speakers"
4,Tasty and price is good too,Great tasting bar that will hold you for hours at the best price I have seen on the net. Probably my favorite Met-Rex Bar. Not as sweet and junk-foody as the Collasal 100 Bars.
3,"Blah Taste, Pithy Consistency","Standard protein bar, no better than anything else out there, huge disappointment. NONE of the ""Protein Plus"" products are at the same level of awesome that the Met-Rx Colossal Big 100 bars have... By comparison, these are just as terrible as every other competitors' product."
5,these are my favorite bars,That about says it for me. I have tried many protein bars over the years and these are my favorite. I stay with the low sugar high protein variety bars; sometimes I have to eat half of these at a time because they are so high in protein; and definitely drink water with these. but I don't find these to have that annoying after taste of other bars
1,Would have been nice if half the chocolate coating wasn't missing.,"Bought these because they were listed for the lowest price out of the sites I had browsed. Well, now I know why. Each one was missing half of the chocolate coating on the bar. That just doesn't cut it for me. If I pay for a product, I expect to receive the whole product. Won't be buying these from here again."
2,Sugar in a noisy bag,"Incredibly rich and tasty! Lists lots of protein, so that's good. But, watch out for sugar overload! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me. 26 grams of sugar in the Apple Crisp! OMdiabetes! To my knowledge, all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels. The wrapper is super noisy; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone...forget it. Again, on the plus side the bar is really tasty and alleges high protein; on the down side, sugar quantity is sky high and the wrapper is really noisy."
2,Price Increased by 50% over the summer.,I am no longer happy with this item as the price has increased by 50% over the summer.Previously this was a good buy now it is just the same price as you woudl find in your local store.
1,Good Product but don't order it online,"I buy these bars locally & have found they are a good source of protein, very filling and I love the tast of the peanut butter crisp. I use them as a replacement for breakfast a few times a week, because I just really don't like many breakfast foods (except for the gooey fattening ones of course!).The problem I had with these bars is that they had not been stored properly or they were very old. They did not look right when I opened one, so I tried another & it was the same thing. Dried out & crumbly looking. I returned these to Amazon and got a refund.So, the bars are great, just not good from this supplier."
3,its ok i suppose,i bought these because i knew i would eat them after a workout or something. they arrived very melted inside their package. it was not a huge deal but does make it crack and crumble when eaten. tastes pretty good but not leaps and bounds better than other protein bars. just ok with an ok price
3,"Good tasting, but healthy?","This protein bar tastes great, however the major problem I have with this protein bar and the other flavors with this brand is the amount of sugar alchol. While they claim only 2-3g of sugar, the rest is compensated with 26-28g of sugar alcohol which is way more than one person should have. The amount of sugar alchol gave me the worst case of gas I had in a long time which is simply not ideal for working out in a gym full of big angry scary men yelling all the time if you know what I mean. I think if they were to decrease the amount of sugar alcohol and compensate for a little more actual sugar to keep the sweet taste, it would be smart move."
1,"great product, but not when shipped","I love these bars... when i purchase them locally. The two boxes that I was shipped were stale or something. I love Amazon and we use it for most everything, but these bars are best fresh from your local stores."
2,Stored in a hot warehouse?,"Ordered in December, but all the bars appear to have melted in the package at some point in their history. They re-hardened in a mixed mess and tasted OK, though, so I'm not returning them. They're just really messy and difficult to eat in this condition, so I'm giving two stars. Check the images to see what my bars looked like."
5,"Met RX, Creamy Cookie Crisp... Delicious & Guilt Free","Met Rx carries a wonderful line of high protein...low carb...no sugar bars. They are perfect as meal replacements or protein supplements. The creamy cookie crisp is my favorite flavor. IT has only 340 calories and is absolutely delicous. It doesn't taste like a diet bar at all. No guilt because it has little sugar and a lot of protein. It tastes sweet, crunchy, and very filling."
3,"Like These Protein Bars, but Last Two Deliveries were Melted!!!","Met-Rx has a great product here; and the Amazon 'subscription' price beats the heck out of the grocery store price; but we're thinking about canceling our regular monthly order with Amazon because the bars were melted - deformed into a twisted goo inside their wrappings - in the last two shipments.It is important to note that we live in Florida; but the mail man brings the box to my front door, rings the door bell, and hands me the package. Guess it gets pretty warm somewhere in the journey!"
5,One of the better Met-Rx protein bars,"Taste-wise, I think this is one of the better Met-Rx protein bars. It does have a little less protein and more sugar, however. I like to add it into my protein bar rotation every once in a while for a change of pace."
1,Should be titled Mocha Mud Pie,"Before I purchased a box of this I looked up what Mud Pie is and it sounded good. Upon trying one the strongest taste was coffee and sure enough in the ingredients is ""Instant Coffee"". No one I spoke to has never heard of Mud Pie being inclusive of coffee. Unless you want a java protein bar avoid this."
1,Not worth it,"If you plan on keeping your teeth, I wouldn't recommend buying this product. You'll practically rip your front teeth out trying to bite off each chunk, and your rear molars will be sore the REST OF THE DAY from the chewing, and that's from consuming only one bar! If available, select the choc-choc chunk. It's tastier and much easier to eat!"
1,Good taste but u will get diarrhea,"Edible taste, not the best but I would keep buying them if i didn't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea. It is not just this met-rx bar that will do this to you, it is any food with sugar alcohols. All Atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol. They do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do, so the theory is that they dont store fat. Only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom. You only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom. Not Worth It."
5,Cheapest I Have Found,This is great. I have subscribed to get 2 boxes of these bars every month. I usually eat one a day during the week at work to count for a meal. Only 3 grams of sugar and tasty for a high protein bar. I would be careful if you have never eaten one before as they might give you gas due to the sugar alcohols. If you have no shame then the gas might not bother you. Gas is a normal thing for weigh lifters:)
5,yummy,These are just the thing you need after a hard workout. Filled with protein and they taste good; convenient and cheaper than what you would pay in the grocery store (if you can find them there).
1,badly stored food,"I signed up for the monthly delivery of these bars and was so disappointed with the product. I love Met Rx bars and this price was a great deal and the delivery was a great convenience. Unfortunately whoever provides these bars for Amazon.com does not store them appropriately and they appear to have been melted and cooled a number of times. They are hard as a rock, disfigured and the chocolate covering has turned white in many places. They are grainy tasting and lack they're original flavor. All three cases I received, three different flavors, where all in the same condition. The expiration date was far in advance so it is not an old issue, just a storage issue (I work in the grocery business :))I cancelled my subscription immediately. They may be cheaper but it's worth it to buy fresh ones at the drugstore."
2,not as fresh as it should be,"We have really enjoyed this product in the past, but the order we purchased from Amazon was dried out and not fresh-tasting. We may give it another try sometime, but for now we'll try to find it somewhere else."
4,Chocolate crisp that packs in the protein!,"I don't like gooey protein bars that can pull out a dental filling, and most are just too sticky and tacky. Not this bar, and the taste is good, too. Not like a candy bar, but we don't eat them for that reason, right?"
3,Taste?,"I am sure many people will like the taste of this; I don't care for it much, myself, which surprised me."
3,Not that great,"Aside from the nutrition content, these bars aren't that great. The taste is just not there. I prefer Builders bars over this, which have a more ""natural"" taste."
2,Not even getting what you pay for,"Seems when they ship these, they all have melted, the 'cookie' part has sank down to one side of the bar, and you wonder if they know that you can't store these in a 130 degree warehouse.Overall you buy these for something to eat when you want protein/carbs due to training. You can get that from these, but don't expect great taste. If the whole bar was covered like it was supposed to be, then these would be great. Otherwise 1/5th of the bar is good, the rest is dry and chalky.Eat them if you have too, but otherwise look for something else."
3,Great bar - but melted and cooled,"The bar is great tasting, but it was heated and cooled - in December. Where did it get heated at? Or was it heated before they ever shipped it out?"
4,Protein Peanut Butter Crisp Bars Pretty Tasty,This is one of the better tasting protein bars and I've tried many different brands and flavors. I say try them ~ Protein bars are slowly but surely getting better and they come in handy when you're on the run ~ especially important during the holidays.
4,Better than a Butterfinger,These protein bars are the yummiest bars I've ever tasted. They are great as a meal replacement and certainly fill you up fast. I eat them maybe twice a week to keep my diet in check. I highly recommend them if you are a peanut butter holic!
1,Psalms as drama for drama's sake not Psalm's sake,"The Psalms in Worship is a selection of Psalms or Psalm parts divided to be read by leader and congregation, by two voices, by chorus and solo voices ... etc. While I am fond of antiphonal Psalm repetition and while Psalm scholarship has shown that some Psalms are intended to be done in various voices, I fail to see how the divisions proposed by the authors of this volume enhance or emphasis the meaning and structure of the Psalm.The final section of this book includes responsories based on Psalms which are well done. For example a call to worship based on Psalm 34:3 has the leader say ""Glorify the Lord with me"" to which the people respond ""Let us exalt his name together"".I do not, however, find this portion sufficient to justify recommending the book."
4,Great product great price,I am very happy with Now rosewater concentrate. It is a very fine product at an unbeatable price. Shipping was a little slow but I am happy about the quality and price. Thank you
5,Great!,"I think the person who wrote this is ... has something wrong with him, or can't figure out how to you use this cd player because he is stupid. I've had mine for about a year, and it never skips. The sound quality is great! I think it is the perfect discman for everyone."
1,Crap!,"When one selects the ""MB"" or ""Groove"" options on this piece of garbage, the sound distorts. After two weeks, sound stopped coming from the left earphone. One week after that, the ""sound"" button that allows you to select ""MB"" or ""Groove"" stopped working, so at that point, you can't even distort the sound if you wanted to!!! I never dropped or mishandled this piece of junk. Even if I did, when brand new, the sound quality still stunk and the anti-skip leaves much to be desired. Stay away!!!"
1,cheap CD player,This CD player is so cheap. It skips for no reason. and the batteries last about 5 minutes
3,"A bit old, but still good.","The D-E561 was going to be replacing my older D-E307CK which I had, but I had a few gripes about it.The E561 is by all means an excellent Discman. It is VERY slim, and the main playing controls are easily accessable. However, the volume control is located behind the headphone jack, which makes accessing the volume control a bit awkward from the front.However, there are a couple of newer Sony Discman technologies out (now called a CD Walkman), that make this model slightly less appealing. First off is the G Protection anti-skip, which replaces the ESP and ESP 2. Those players absolutely DO NOT skip even when shaken violently. Also, battery life on those players is 32 hours with G-Protection on, vs. the 20 in this model. However, form factor is generally a bit thicker.Your choice, this is by no means a terrible player, but you may want to check to see what other options you may have from Sony and other companies."
2,Not a very good disc man,"i got this disc man for christmas and i was very dissapointed.....at first i was happy, it looks good, its thin, light and its a cool overall looking discman, the reason i gave it 2 stars was because of the esp2, already having the reg esp, i thought this would be much better, but it turns out that this esp2 works worse then the reg esp! the discman will even skip for no reason when i have it sitting on a table, i wwas very dissapointed with the product......sometimes SOMETIMES it'll even work better when the esp is off!i only gave it 2 stars cause the battery life is very good, but not woth buying cause that's more time with the annoying esp2"
1,"""for the T-Mobile Sidekick 3"" Yeah right.","This is falsely advertised as working for the Sidekick 3, but it doesn't work. Why? The Sidekick series has never charged over the USB, as it's always been USB 1.1. Sorry to anyone who was looking for a good deal, keep moving because this isn't one."
1,Burn BEFORE reading,Ursula K. Le Guin is my favorite writer. That is why I advise you: do not read this book. It is surely the worst of Le Guin's novels and I hope the author is ashamed of it and wants to forget that she ever wrote it. (But I am not sure if my hope is well located.)
3,Minor LeGuin,"Written, I suspect, for a juvenile audience, The Eye of the Heron deals with many of LeGuin's favorite themes. Violence versus pacifism, hierarchy versus democracy, partriarchy versus feminism, and exile all figure in this novel. This book does not, however, have the depth or quality of writing of her best books. The plot is a bit mechanical and predictable, the characterization is a bit thin, and the quality of writing is good as opposed to outstanding. This book isn't at the level of The Lathe of Heaven or The Word for World is Forest, let alone The Dispossessed or The Left Hand of Darkness. As a juvenile book, this isn't at the level of the best Earthsea books."
3,Difficult Read,"This book, I thought, was a very hard read, mostly because it had many run- on sentences that seem to go on forever. Sometimes she goes off on a tangent, which means she continues describing something that isn't relevant to the story. Le Guin has written many amazing books, but this is not one of them."
4,This book shows a hope for oppression all over the world.,"I enjoyed this book. It showed inventive ideas and was very inspirational. I hope you will also read The Word For World is Forest, because it also shows hope for oppressed peoples. I have only read three of her books, but this was by far the best."
4,Fun and old fashion,"I first read ""I, The Jury"" when I was a kid and recently ordered this copy to reread it. If you have never read a Mike Hammer novel they are old fashioned and fun to read. Compared to a Robert B. Parker or Georges Simenon detective novel it is not nearly as well written,sophisticated or classy, but it is good and gritty private eye stuff. It really harkens back to the older style of detective you used to see in movies with Humphrey Bogart."
5,"""I, the Jury","""I,the Jury"" is a must read for any mystery fan. The first 1947 Mickey Spillane novel introduces the most celebrated P.I. in mystery history, Mike Hammer. This is an action packed novel that shows, for the first time, a Private Investigator that takes things personally and deals out his own kind of justice. Powerful with a surprise ending."
4,gonzo detective work,"It is not easy to reconcile Mike Hammer into todays arch types of law and order, masculinity and conservatism. He carries around his private detective license and gun permit, flaunts traffic laws, and orders ordinary police patrolmen around. The debut novel unfolds like something Hunter S. Thompson would write, only with fewer words. It is hard to rationalize his progress through the case. Eventually he reaches the end of it."
5,Hard-boiled classic,"Spillane's first novel is unfortunately out of print and I hope this will encourage the publishers to reprint. It's a classic redoing of the hard-boiled tradition, taking the essentials of the plot of the Maltese Falcon, adding even more sex and violence, and casting its hero, Mike Hammer, as a returned veteran of WWII, disgusted with the world that he and his buddies had fought to preserve. It marks the beginning of Spillane's long career as a detective novelist, is essential to understanding where the detective goes after Hammett and Chandler, and is a terrific read!"
1,Mickey Spillane is a hack,"Truly, truly bad... If you want good noir, see, Hammett or Chandler (both pof the Macdonalds are great too). Spillane simply does not know how to write: the prose is awful, the murderer managed to be both obvious and utterly implausible, the main character is an egotistical brute with no redeeming values. Very unpleasant to read.If you must read Spillane, you might try his later work--its possible he learned to write in his later years..."
4,A psychological thriller! Can Evil ever really die?,"""Only a Game"" is a suspense filled fiction novel about an emotionally dysfunctional family. Diane, the mother, is an emotional wreck. Alan feeds off his mother's terror and her insecurities. A battle between good and evil rages throughout the book until it comes to a violent conclusion. Diane suspects her son has committed murder, but her mind cannot accept this. She conceives the idea that Alan is possessed by an evil demon.Is the family gripped in terror because of dementia or are evil forces at work? You decide. The surprise ending not only takes your breath away, it practically screams for a sequel!This is a very well written chiller that hooks you right away. Should definitely be on anyone's ""A"" list to buy!"
1,"Badly Conceived, Badly Made","Just got this today and watched it with mt wife. The two people involved are engaging and skilled, but the useful content could have been presented in about 8-10 minutes. Specific problems: (1) extremely amateur video production, no chapters (so you have to watch the entire DVD all the way through every time you want to look at a specific section), weird junk footage, intrusive music; (2) no clear sense of how to instruct - you mostly just get to watch two people do rather extreme x-c ski training without skis; (3) ugly, technically distorted footage used to attack ""other kinds"" of nordic walking - whatever those are. I'm pretty sure this is the worst instructional DVD I've ever seen, on any topic."
5,Perfect For The Game Boy Advance Traveler,"This car game pack is excellent for the traveler. With the headphones you can ignore your parents boring radio stations. With the D/C adapter you can play games without your battery running out. Sometimes your parents have to put on their mobile phone in the D/C outlet in your car, then just use the rechargeable battery pack. Then if you are still driving in your car and it is dark, you don't have to stop playing. Just use the lighted game shield. If you travel in the car for a long time this is how to pass the time and have FUN!"
1,Lipstick pepper spray,Unfortunately the lipstick pepper spray was cancelled by the company and my credit card was reimbursed. Maybe there is a restriction in California for this item?
2,"Good concept, poor execution",The main problem with these puzzle cards is that they are double-sided. (Example: viernes on one side/lunes on the other.) Dumb idea! I find them therefore to be not very useful as a learning tool. Plus this is not indicated anywhere on the package or product description.
2,Double-sided for the same subject-why?,"Like the other reviewer said they are double-sided which would be fine if what was on the back was a completely different subject but it's the same (half the months are on one side, half on the other and the same with the days of the week, etc.) so you can never look at all of the subject at one time. Otherwise, it's a good idea."
1,Barely worth the inexpensive price.,"This book barely provides the entertainment value of what it costs to purchase. The photos themselves are haphazard with little artistic value. There are some interesting graphic design elements to this book but they are few. Overall, a disappointment..."
3,the best thing to have,"Hello, you may not like what i wants to say but, it is through, this book techings one to pray and prayer is the key to life.So my friend learn to pray."
4,"""I Say Nothing"" is worth the CD price, all by itself.","I remember hearing ""I Say Nothing"" on the car radio FM (out of Baja) when I was stationed up at Camp Pendleton, and the choruses/refrains hooked me instantly. It's one of those tracks on which a band does almost everything just right. I've since made it a point to hear most everything else that VoB has done, and ""I Say Nothing"" has a rare pop magic that you see (or rather hear) once in a blue moon. I would have paid $10 for a CD single of that tune."
5,The coolest thing about them is their name.,"This group is really cool. They have a cool name, their songs are cool, and their lyrics are also really cool. Actually, their lyrics are great. I guess they remind me of the B-52's, but rather than do them the injustice of classifying them I'll just praise them: their voices are good, and they achieve a lovely harmony. The songs are fun, lots of fun; doing housework listening to this music makes the job less tedious. The music can be uplifting, and never gets dull. It also makes my birds crazy, and any music than can touch the heart of a beast must have merit, right? I highly recommend this cd."
4,"Unknown, but upbeat and good to go!","I'm a Beehive fan, so my view is a little biased, though not as much as the other reviewers I've read here. I wouldn't rate them as a classic or an all-time great, but I agree with the sentiment of the other reviewers. If you want a band that gives you a really alive, fresh feeling when you listen to their music, Voice of the Beehive will do it. They play music that mainstream listeners like, but it's just that little bit different from everything else on the shelf that it will keep you coming back to its originality. They are fresh, with a humorously cynical view on life. If 'I Walk the Earth' and 'Trust Me' were given the airplay they deserve they would have gone top ten. It may seem like a risk because you've never heard of them before, but if you buy this album, or 'Honey Lingers' (I haven't been able to listen to their third album yet) you won't be dissapointed. Fresh and vibrant and new to the senses."
5,The world's most amazing group,"I NEVER listen to pop music because it doesn't sound like this anymore. Where are these guys -- I need more Beehive. Seriously, you could listen to this album over and over and never get bored. Great beats, FANTASTIC lyrics. I can't say enough about it. ""Harder"" than ""Honey Lingers"". The guy that introduced me to this group called them ""Bangles gone bad."" GREAT GREAT GREAT."
4,One of my favorites,Don't Call Me Baby and I Say Nothing are what has made this album my favorite one for the past 8 years. I can't wait to get it on CD so I can listen to it in my car and relive my early 20s when I was single and those two particular songs were my anthems.
5,"Ah, Memories!!!!","My college roommate introduced me to this band and this CD (gulp!) 20 years ago, and they are still one of my faves! Love, love, LOVE the Beehive!"
1,Where is it?,"I bought this CD on 24th Jan 2008 and its now 24 Feb 2008 and the fu**ing thing still hasn't arrived. This is consistent with Amazon, you buy something and just accept it will take a month to arrive even if you pay a premium for express delivery. 'Express delivery' is a total fu**ing con as well."
4,easy on the ears and good for the soul,"Being a Greg Brown fan, I bought this album when it was first released, even though I had no idea who Bill Morrissey was, and I'm usually not interested in albums full of covers. This collection, though, has provided me with hours of listening pleasure. It's something like having two friends with deep, resonant voices come over and serenade you with old favorites and a few songs you might not have heard before. The mood is reflective, as the two artists seem to be singing songs which affect them, sometimes with humor, other times with poignancy. It can come off as a bit maudlin, owing to the number of bluesey songs. Some of the cuts really stick with you, particularly ""Ain't Life a Brook"" and ""He Was a Friend of Mine,"" and I still laughingly tell people ""he's been on the job too long,"" referring to the tragic characters in ""Duncan and Brady."""
4,Friend of Mine Bill Morrissey and Greg Brown,"This is a wonderful collaboration of two of my favorite folkies. I especially enjoy their renditions of Ferron's ""Ain't Life a Brook"" and the traditional ""He Was a Friend of Mine"". ""Fishin With Bill"" just makes me smile."
4,If for no other reason..,"I would rarely recommend that you purchase an album for one song - but if for no other reason, you should acquire this CD for the brilliant version of The Rolling Stones' ""You can't always get what you want"". There are many other great covers but this is the absolute standout. Only Travis Tritt's version of ""Honky Tonk Woman"" is a better Stones cover - and trust me, I've heard plenty.Greg Brown is a great songwriter / artist in his own right but I have used this song to introduce many people to his style."
4,An Irish Orphan in India in the 19th century,"This is sort of an Indian James Bond story with a realholy man guru as the second hero.Kim is Kimball O'Hara whose Dad was in an Irish regiment in India when he died.He left his son as a street orphan in India.Kim finds friends is strange places from a Buddhist lama to an Afghanistani horse trader and a British spy master. He is enlisted in the British Secret Service by those who should be trying to bring him up right?Thus, in the service of what is today thought to be evil as the British Empire's colonialization of India, he wonders as the servant of the lama doing a secret mission against the Russians.What I liked most about this book is the look at Indian multiculturalismin the 19th century."
3,Review of Kim,"Great book...have been reading it in a hisotry class...easy to read, flows well and engaging."
3,"A nicely formatted edition, if a bit pricy","This review is forKim (Penguin Classics) (Kindle edition)Publisher: PenguinASIN: B0050N7G8QA nicely formatted edition with lots of extras. Indeed, so many extras that I can't comment on the text, as the sample doesn't actually get to the text itself. Hopefully based on the same clean text as the ePenguin editionKim (Penguin Modern Classics) [Kindle Edition]No illustrations as far as I can tell. Three stars because of the price and lack of illustrations. The J. Lockwood Illustrations are worth having.If you're looking for a Kindle edition of Kim, don't just search for ""Kim"". That only finds a few of the many editions. Search for ""Kim Kipling"" (without the quotes) to find the many editions available. And also look for my review ""Kindle Edition Choice is critical"" for a review of all the available editions as of January 2012. I can't give a live link to the mass review here, but its web address is: http://www.amazon.com/review/RYXM7JHQPNONU/"
3,this book had potential except...,"whoever transcribed this book for kindle didn't do such a great job, so it makes it hard to read and follow the story. when i started i wanted to quit, so i made myself at least read until 25%. when i got there i decided i would try to read a little more... i'm at 50% right now and i decided i just can't make it through the rest of this book. the paragraphs are all chopped up and at some points you can't tell who's talking or what's going on. in a few words without giving anything away (((which i haven't read the whole book so i'm really not giving any spoilers here))) this is a story of a white boy that was orphaned in india and goes on a journey. i'm sure if this book was transcribed properly it would be worth the read."
2,Kim,Kim is a good. though dated. novel. but badly transcribed. In some places very badly transcribed.
3,my review of Kim,I enjoyed this book. I think it is a very good insight to older Indian culture under English control. The story is about a young boy who goes on a journey with a Buddist llama in his search for the river that will cleanse all sins. Kim encounters many adventures and interesting situations as he gets involved in British military affairs. I would recommend this book for those who are interested in more challenging reading have an attraction for both the cultural and the spiritual.
3,"Fine adventure bok, but not what I expected","Although I have read tons of literature, I have never read Kipling, but of course have heard of him. This book was a fine adventure tale, but I suppose I was expecting something a little bit more profound and insightful. The novel has a fun plot and plenty of interesting characters, but seems void of any real conflict. Even if I got a biased view, I was looking for some insight into the politics and culture of colonial India at the turn of the century. The events and dialogue in this book all seem to touch things on the surface and at the end of day it didn't make me THINK about things like a good book does. This would be a fun book to read along with your precocious 12 year old, but I wouldn't recommend it to an adult looking for good literature. If your interested in great literary fiction dealing with India, read ""A Fine Balance"" by Rohinton Mistry..much better."
1,Don't bother!,This one's not properly formattedfor the KindleDon't bother!It will drive you nutsBut don't overlook the bookKipling is a lot more sophisticated than he looksSome have called this a mystery or thrillerI loved the intricate look at cultureand a little bonusA lama's enlightenment
1,WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I had heard that Kim was one of the best books of all time. Had to wait 2 months for library to acquire it.Have never been so disappointed in anything. Cults, voodoo, spells, magic, demonic activity, caste system, blasphemy, abuse, violence, superstition, humanism (worship of certain humans), depression, ... UGH!!WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!! DON'T BOTHER READING THIS."
1,Where is the plot?,"If you want to read a book where there is no plot, no action and no humor look no further than Kim. Too bad Kipling spent so many years writing this novel. Just So Stories and the Jungle Book are childhood favorites of mine, Kim just lacks that charming quality in this adult novel. Think Huck Finn meets Pip set in India with no where to go and nothing to do."
1,This book gave me cramps in my brain.,"Please! I thought kipling was supposed to be a good author.. Until I read Kim. I cannot comprehend why anyone would enjoy or have any desire to read a piece of utter (...) like this. In the first chapter I got bored. In the second chapter my mind wandered. By the fifth chapter I was having convulsions. By the tenth chapter I was having a severe epileptic seisure and was experiencing demonic posession of some type.. Ok, well maybe it wasn't that bad, but this book is a disgrace to reputable literature. If books had odors this one would be a heap of fertilizer in the hot July sun. I've read some other Kipling books and they were decent, but this bag of cat droppings gave me mental cramps and contortions. I'm hemorraghing here! Help! Save me from this (...)..."
4,"Hard reading, but worth it","Some people sail through this book. I wanted to read the oft-mentioned classic, but found it difficult to get into. A friend had the nine-CD version and loaned it to me. So I listened to each CD while I followed along word-by-word reading in the book. Quite worth it."
4,Kipling's Classic novel : KIM,"In my personal opinion, this Rudyard Kipling classic is one of the finest historical novels ever written. Though it has been made into videos & books for juveniles, it is actually a subtle adult piece of literature. It was Kipling who coined therein the phrase:""The Great Game"". History repeats itself, as now America has replaced England in this spider web set in India & the high mountain passes leading to Central Asia. As always, Kipling helps us to stand back & laugh at our human foibles, while yet being dead serious.Had I the funds, I would have preferred a better quality edition, as I plan to keep this for re-reading. This is a cheap edition, with print too close to the inner margins --- very stiff & annoying to hold open."
1,This edition of Kim is full of misprints - buy another,"Kim is a great story, but this is NOT the edition to buy. It's too bad, because it's a handsome book, sturdily built, and with the largest text out there (which is why I bought it). But unfortunately the text is full of misprints. Random periods, missing letters, wrong words, and a section of repeated text like a cut and paste operation gone astray. It's a bad value, and a worse gift. Move on..."
3,Humor is largely lacking,"The New Yorker magazine has a deserved reputation for printing some of the funniest cartoons. Unfortunately, that is not evident in this collection. While some of them are good and elicit a chuckle, the majority come across as bland and at best generates a smile. While the medical profession can be lampooned in a hilarious manner, that does not happen here."
3,not the best but not the worst,"spy novels generally isn't my thing, but I try to read across genres to broaden my own craft as a writer. This book was ok, good story line, but very boring. Too many adverbs, leading to telling not showing. The characters were believable but the character development was very poor. There was not much deliniation between personalities. If you are into spy novels, I'd recommend author Ron Adams."
2,Disappointing,"Anyone who has read The Company surely will be disappointed with this short novel. While it was a fast read, it was mostly unspectacular and the writing was poor."
2,"A first effort, one to try and forgive?","""The Publisher's Review"" was kind to end its assessment of the book with, ""...but a little silly.""""Silly"" began about page five and reappeared frequently during the remaining 285 pages. We're looking here at ""silly"" at the high school composition level, and the plot is strained and worse even than the writing.This was copywritten 13 years ago, and Littell has become a somewhat better writer in the interim. I just finished his latest, ""The Company,"" and it was worth about 3 1/2 stars. I'll skip anything else by him.The old phrase, ""the book's not worth the candle,"" is too kind for ""The Once and Future Spy."""
3,A Little Too Ambiguous...?,"Bottom line, I liked the premise and enjoyed the read - that is, until I reached the end. I confess, I don't yet quite get it. In six months, once I have had a chance to reflect on the book for a little longer, ""Whose truth, what truth?"" may help the book come into better focus. But at this point, I simply am not sure how to interpret the end. For instance, where did large parts of the story take place - in the ""real world"" or in Silas' head? What was Snow's motivation for doing what she did at the end - was she mistaken about her information (re: Huxstep) and more convinced that something wasn't quite right with Silas? Ambiguity is a given in the world of intelligence, but this was a bit too ambiguous for my tastes.Fellow fans, help me out. If you can, I may come back again and revise my rating upwards. If not, then let's let a 3-star rating stand for a good book make a little too complicated for its own good."
2,Death by fire,"I neglected to add the following to my previous review. The author would have the reader believe that the murderer simply poured gasoline on the victim then disposed of the gasoline can, lit a match, all while the victim stayed still waiting his fate. Assuming a fire can be easily be started in this manner, would not the murderer also have been injured by the resulting fire since she was just a few feet away? Would not the victim at the very least moved or gotten out of the vehicle since he would not have died instantly?I fould it hard to enjoy this book based on a false premise."
2,Unbelievable,"There are just too many coincidences and unbelievable incidents that mar this book.A bicyclist hit by a ""large car driving fast towards her"" is uninjured and fails to obtain information from the driver. Much later she goes to London for no mentioned reason and while there decides to go to the gallery in the House of Lords. She almost immediately recognizes the voice of the person speaking as the one who hit her.I presume the editor caught this and other unbelieable incidents, but it would have perhaps been difficult to make changes (after all James is 85) and still make the publishing deadline. In fact I would go so far as to say there could not have been a book if incidents such as the above were eliminated.This is probably James' last Dalgliesh book."
5,A return to reading an old favorite,"PD James has been writing murder mysteries with Dalgliesh as her main character since the 1960s. I've owned this book for several years, but only just got around to reading it.The book and the series is not about Dalgliesh or his life. The book is about solving a series of ugly murders. His life, and the lives of his team are the background. I enjoy the fact that the ending of these books arrive with a reasonable, and fair conclusion.But mostly you read PD James for the language. If there are literary books out there, this certainly is one of them. And it is a very good example of a book where you are reading, at least part of the time, for the language."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"James best books are psychological novels in a crime setting. In the very best of them, she combines clever plotting, a high level of writing and characterization, and sustained examination of a particular psychological theme. In none of these categories does James approach her best work. In most respects, this is a fairly standard mystery with above average writing. I suspect James was aiming at attacking a particular psychological theme, the idea of secret or hidden lives, but this aspect is not developed well. This would be a good effort for most mystery writers but not close to James best novels."
5,Mystery as Literature,"Each of the mysteries of P.D. James is actually literature and not for those who want a ""quick read"" or a lot of gunfire. This author is a master of the genre and uses it to explore the human condition. The characters are not simple cardboard cutouts who spout tough talk. These are well developed, thoughtful portraits that reflect humanity. From the beginning of the series to the present novel, it becomes clear why P.D. James is one of the most respected British authors. I have looked forward to and treasured each book and this is one of Ms. James' best. I envy those readers about to discover her."
5,Superb as always,"I've ""discovered"" PD James quite recently with ""Death in the Holy Orders"". ""The Murder Room"" is another excellent book based on the same proven recipe: the poet-turned-inspector Dagliesh with his less intellectual but decent team (one wonders why Elisabeth George abandonded the same proven recipe and got lost), an intriguing setting (in this case a fictional Belle Epoque Museum on Hapmstead Heath) and a well woven whodunnit. The fact that the structure of the story remains practically the same with previous books this does not make ""The Murder Room"" any less enjoyable. A well written book that is surprisingly modern and in line with current societal values. Most enjoyable."
2,The only Dagliesh book I do not like,"I am a huge fan of PD James and Adam Dagliesh, but this book just did not work for me. The characters were unappealing, the plot was unbelievable. I normally love mysteries that are slow-paced and build to a climax, and normally you can count on PD James for this type of mystery, but not this time. The book was boring, by the end I found myself wishing I hadn't wasted my time. It was so disappointing."
1,BORING,"I always finish a book and I tried very hard to stick with this one. But half way through it, I realized that I was wasting precious time so I gave up on it. There are just too many descriptive paragraphs that add nothing to the story or the characters. The characters are stuffy and even the ones you are supposed to like, come off as wooden. The writing style simply does not flow so I found myself re-reading. Don't waste your money or time with this one..."
4,Twisty Chilling Thriller,"P.D. James has a moodily delightful read with The Murder Room. The Room itself, part of a museum dedicated to the interwar years in Britain, is full of artifacts of actual historical crimes which become important in the murders which follow, as well as being an effective hook in the beginning of the book to lure the reader forward. This very concept was the driving force for a history buff, such as myself, to pick up the book and return to P.D. James after being away a number of years. The rest of the novel does not let this marvelous lead-in down. The twists come relatively fast and furious and while often unbelievable are just as often unexpected. The ending is somewhat of a let-down but with all the various turns and coincidences the plot had to sustain, it could almost not be any other way. A wonderfully atmospheric and gripping thriller."
2,"Been There, Done That","The usual detail on room decoration, depressed characters and dysfunctional families, without an inspired or original plot to support them. The crimes themselves, despite some attractive trappings, turn out to be flat and dull, while also implausible--a problem in a ""realistic"" crime novel. The characters mostly are the same stuffy, wealthy, well-spoken elitists we've seen before, too many times now, with the usual wrangle taking place over the attempted closing of some august and architecturally distinguished building. Dalgleish fans I guess are happy to see him romancing Emma, the only problem here is we don't see much in the way of romance. Their romance lacks any of the charm and appeal of the classic romances in James' much admired Crime Queen trio of Sayers, Allingham and Marsh. It's a shame, because one can tell from her personal appearances and interviews that James is a charming, amusing woman. Too bad she snuffs out these qualities in her books."
4,"very very good, but...","I love all the Adam Dalgleish stories, and appreciate the detail about architecture, English side streets, London, etc, that the author gives us. The two murders that take place are presented with skill, but as one who looks for clues as to ""whodunnit"", I was stymied. Particularly frustrating was the indication in the late chapters that Dalgleish and his entire crew knew who did it...they just weren't telling us. Even on completing the book, and re=reading some of the last chapters, I still have no idea how the Commander identified the murderer. And why the murderer included some ""copycat"" details of the Murder Room was never explained, at least to this reader. As some other readers have said, I read the very last chapters more on edge about Dalgleish's appointment with Emma--would he get there or not?--than I did about the murder. Still and all, a very good read."
3,Second-class 'Room',"James lays out some stunning setpieces and intriguing themes in ""Murder Room,"" but it never quite comes together. I was hoping for more description of the inter-war years and psychological insight into Dalgliesh, but he becomes more like a chick-lit ""white knight"" in every book. James can't seem to get beyond his devotion for the annoyingly perfect Emma to involve him in any depth in the actual mystery. And some of the plot twists were laughable excursions into '70s style ""decadence."" Please, I appreciate James' reluctance to indulge in modern serial killer butchery, but orgies just don't cut it as a ""horrible secret"" any more. In all, well written and diverting but far from her best..."
3,"Good, but not her best.","P.D. James is one of my very favorite authors, her stories are complicated and intelligent, but not burdened with lots of bad language or graphic descriptions of violence. I did think this book was weaker than her other books. I thought most of the characters were shallow and belligerent, the ones that weren't were hardly used. The narration was dull, I had difficulty telling the characters apart occasionally. The last chapter on the Commander's private life was oddly unsatisfying. I've always left the other books wanting more information on Dalgliesh's life outside of the office, but once I was given it, I was sorry I'd asked. It didn't seem to fit and it had the feel of a Cary Grant movie. Given the age of the author, I was left wondering if she wanted to tie up some loose ends with the Commander. If you are a fan already, you will like it, but overall, I was only *satisfied* with it."
4,Murder room,You just can't beat p d James! SHE knows how to write. Her sentences intrigue me. I always feel I am there.
3,"Enjoyable, but not extraordinary","I am glad that I read this book, but it's not the best crime thriller and for those used to great things from P.D. James it's a little disappointing.Few crime writers do character development as well as James, but if she'd just reigned it in a little this book would've gone from good to great. We don't need to know the history of every little side character. Also, the motivation for the central murder was not convincing.Overall: 3 stars out of 5."
4,Her best yet,"I had grown tired of PD James because she seemed to peter out about three quarters of the way through her novels. So many of her novels just ended with a pop! rather than a bang!This novel is different however. Not that her endings aren't still a bit weak (once again she provided a reason behind the crime that is never explained) but this book is so well written, most of the characters so well described, that I felt a sense of contentment when I finally turned the last page. AND she had kept my attention through a 4-hour plane ride! Unusual for me.I do get the sense however that she had to leave out a chapter because her editor said it was too long and then she forgot to go back and rewrite the bit that introduced that chapter."
4,Murder Room,"P.D. James has written 17 books, and I've read all of them. Some of them were better than others, and the reviews have been mixed on Murder Room, her latest book. In my opinion, this is one of her best, particularly in terms of setting the scene and character development. One feels one knows the characters, especially Tally Clutton, a housekeeper who lives in a cottage on the grounds of the Dupayne Museum. The Dupayne is a small, family run, specialty museum in London whose fate hangs on all three trustees signing a new lease. This sets the stage for murder. The museum has a ""Murder Room"" featuring famous English murders of the 1920s and 30s, and it is where one of the murders takes place. James writes the classic British mystery, and she has an extraordinary command of the English language. This book is a must read for her fans."
5,A Ripe Roaring Yarn with no Lack of Suspects!,"The story set in a museum with no lack of suspects! The story is well designed to catch you, then keep your interest for the duration. She sets out all the characters, and boy are they characters! While the several of characters are very quirky and have serious personal issues, they are well developed and they all have obvious motives to do away with the victim. After having introduced the characters and set the stage, she springs an excellent yarn that challenges your deductive reasoning to its limits. There are lots of surprises and a few 'red herrings' along the way. Adam Dalgliesh does his detecting once again with a humanity not always seen in detective stories and with a personal relationship at stake. I strongly recommend this story to fans of P.D. James, as it is well done and the climax is unexpected, at least to me."
4,Golden Age classic w/ superfluous bridge,"After reading Tau Zero years ago, Poul Anderson became one of my favorite sci-fi authors. Since then I've read a few more of his novels and haven't been so impressed. I almost gave up hope that perhaps Tau Zero was his only great work... until I came across The Star Fox.A fantastic Poul novel! Early space opera- short and sweet. Hesitant earth lets a colony fall to conniving aliens. The main character Heim says, ""Oh oh... hell no! Not while I'm alive! I'm gonna go mess 'em up."" And does so. Chapters 1 and 3 are pretty much part of a linear story and would have been a 5-star read if it hadn't been for the second chapter, which is out of place. Chapter 2 by itself though would have been a good story. However, it turned itself into a superfluous bridge. Overall, fantastic planets, plotting and people."
4,Memories..,It is wonderful to read nursery rhymes you've not heard in years. They bring back such memories! Would buy it again.
4,Riley child-rhymes,"The used volumes' condition was correctly described. The price was right. I had never purchased used books previously and was quite pleased with my transaction. The books arrived in a timely, well wrapped fashion. I was especially happy to locate 3 used volumes in good used condition as these were first printed in 1898 and I am giving them as gifts. I found the purchase and paying to be easy and secure. I highly recommend Amazon."
2,Not what I expexted,"It broke the first time it was played with, I returned it and got a bigger one because I was not satisfied with this one."
2,not too much fun,My 2 yr old cant use & my 5 yr old doesn't like it because it doesn't spin too well
3,Smaller than I expected but well made,"Much smaller than I had expected even though they gave the measurements. I was expecting that once my grandson pumped it up, it would not only spin but would go around in the room. It doesn't. It stays stationary."
3,Rehashed Stuff,"This CD is basically a rehash of the Live At Sturgis album, minus a few good songs. It does have some of the bigger hits, but you would be better off paying a few extra bucks and get the full Live At Sturgis CD. Buy this only if you are strapped for cash."
4,Waterproof case does the job,"The WP-DC60 Waterproof Case worked extremely well for our recent trip to the Carribean. We used it to take pictures of our grandchild underwater in the pool, on a Kayak Trip in the ocean, snorkling with fish and turtles as well as on an island hike. The camera was dry all the time and the pictures in wet and dry environments worked well. I learned that you have to wipe the lens if you are underwater and come up to take a picture above the water. You can get water droplet on the picture. I wish I had practiced with the camera a little before I used because underwater, I was not always sure I had gotten the picture. Also the camera has an auto shut off so I thought I took a few pictures that I did not. That is mostly my fault.I would recommend the product for people who want good quality underwater pictures or who spend time around the water alot."
4,An Enjoyable Film of Fantasy and Friendship,"This movie reminded me of some of the friendship themes of REMEMBER THE TITANS and STAND BY ME. The relationship that develops between the 2 boys seems both mythical and yet believable. Some of their adventures are laughable while others are poignant.Sting's song FREAK THE MIGHTY not only supports the action on screen but also strengthens the link between medieval fantasy and presentday life that the boys enjoy. Elden Henson is impressive as ""Sir Max"" and could be an excellent character actor for years to come."
5,The Mighty,"This is a very good movie that we saw in class. Chesie's favorite part of the movie was when Max took Freak to see the firework show at carnival. She enjoyed this part of the movie because Max was reaching out to Freak. He started uderstanding Freaks disability a little more. Ashely's favorite part of the movie was when Max was in the room waiting for his tutor. Once Freak came in, Max looked shocked. That showed just because people have a certain disability it dosen't mean they're completey dependent. ""The Mighty"" was a good movie; however, it was sad at points. Overall it was a great movie because of the lovable characters and lesson that together we can accomplish more than we can on our own."
4,Freak and the Mighty,"Freak and the Mighty is about a kid named Kevin (Culkin) who has no friends and a boy named Max (Ratliff), ""That's what we call a couple of freaks"". The type of movie is Drama. Max has trouble reading so Kevin helps him by saying ""Every word is part of a picture. Every sentence is a picture just use your imagination to connect the pictures"". This movie relates to another movie called ""The Gonies"" these kids escape from these killers and in the movie ""The Mighty"" two kids escape from the Doghouseboys. I would rate this movie a 4 star movie becouse this movie is a good movie and you can learn a lot from it."
4,Thought provoking!,Wonderful movie....everyone should see it. Great for kids to see what they look like when they are in similar situations.One use of the Lord's name which could have been left out with no effect.
5,Terrific movie for kids and adults,This movie is a great example of kids who see the best in each other and forge a friendship that will have life-long impact.
4,No subtitles or closed captioning,"My family loved this movie after viewing a rental copy from Netflix, so I purchased it from Amazon. People should be aware that the version at Amazon does not contain subtitles (for hearing impaired -- this is a movie about disability, after all!), or any other languages. It does not contain closed captioning either. And the version I rented from Netflix had bonus features (interviews with director and cast, among other things) that are not included on the version for sale at Amazon. If you like to turn on the subtitles when you watch a film, you will be frustrated by this edition."
4,Mighty Good for Children/Family Viewing,I think that the Mighty is an inspirational movie and especially suitable for children and family viewing. It promotes very postive messaging around friendship and coping with/overcoming obstacles. Sharon Stone's acting was great and overall the rest of the cast did well. I thought the music was moving and suited the film.The movie fell short for me in spots because I felt the script was a little too unrealistic and manipulative but don't let that damper your spirits in considering this as a very enjoyable watch with your children. There are some important messages/lessons to be learned here.
5,"If you have kids, have them watch this.","This is movie restores your faith in humanity. It's the antithesis of kids shooting each other in school. Against all odds, from the depths of diverstiy, shines a hope bright enough to illuminate the way for everyone who knows one special young man. If you feel you are the only one who believes in ""Might for Right"" anymore, see this film."
5,Mighty,A must have. A very inspiring movie that makes you think and view life. Will bring tears to your eyes and for me the characters reminded me my friends. GREAT!!!!
4,"The movie was good, the book was better.","I think that the movie, The Mighty, was a good movie, but I thought that the book was better. The movie followed the book pretty good, but a couple of things were to extreme. Like when Kevin takes off in the van and then wrecks it. If that isn't bad enough, then he goes sledding down the hill on the broken bumper of the van.Besides that, I thoght that the movie was good and it tried to stick to what happened in the book. I just don't think they should of added that part. Well, if you liked the movie, you must read the book. Now after reading Freak the Mighty, I plan on reading the sequel to."
1,A disappointment,"I was very disapointed by the film, for I almost fell asleep during the movie and it wasn't even close to catching the aspects of the terrific book. The book touched my soul deeply, but this was just plain bad. Max and Freak did not look or act like I would have imagined, nor did they have the true feelings you could sense from the book. Also, the movie missed many huge points that the was in the book which were crutial to understanding the plot and how close they were. I was very disappointed by the performance of the all star cast with Gillian Anderson, Sharon Stone, and o couple other people. I almost forgot to add that I think that Gillian Anderson and Sharon Stone should have traded parts because their personalities didn't match up with their parts."
1,I wouldn't spend money on it,"I was highly unimpressed with The Mighty. Here we have another 'strong friendship between two outcasts and one of them dies' movies, which I believe is a difficult genre to do well. The problem is that the friendship doesn't start until after the movie begins, and 2 hours (or however long it was) is too short to develop that. If you want to see a movie with the same general idea that is done well, rent 'Simon Birch.' One reason it does well, aside from its strong story line, is that the friendship is already established and the viewers can get on with the events of the plot. Acting was decent at best in the movie. Many times it looked prefabricated, such as the sewer scene and the ambulance scene. And the knight motif got real old, real fast. There's plenty of other movies worth your dollars out there-don't waste them on this one."
1,Don't waste your time !!!!,"This movie is horrible. The emphasis here is on horrible. You'll catch yourself rolling your eyes as the ... imagines he is in Camelot. Can someone please tell this kid to get a life? Real children do not act this way. This movie lacks drama and creativity in place of blunt realism. Its not a movie that picks you up and makes you dream. Rather this movie makes you think the world ... You'll question why someone would make such a film. Pretty much all of the characters are seedy and trashy. Watch this movie if you would like to know what takes place in the lives of trashy people. For inspriration and beauty into the better things of life look at my favorite movies Shakespeare in Love and Gone With the Wind. And if you really want some blunt realism at least watch a quality film like Good Will Hunting. Moral of the story, DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!. Thanks."
3,The Mighty,"I had seen this movie a few years ago and just loved it. So when I saw it offered on amazon I purchased it for my mother who is deaf. Unknown to me the DVD had nether closed caption or subtitles, making it in-viewable for my mother. If you don't need CC or subtitles it is a great family movie. Note: When I tried to return it amazon told me to keep it and also returned my money."
5,The best movie in the universe!,"This movie is the best movie that I have ever seen, featuring Max Kane, a 14-year old teased for his enormous size and his best friend, Kevin, a 14-year old genious who teaches him the real meaning of life. I would recommend this movie to anybody. After reading the book (Freak the Mighty), I just HAD to see the movie. It's just as good as the book. Anybody can enjoy this fantastic story."
4,The Mighty,"This is a great story of a very special friendship shared by two middle school boys,Kevin and Max. Kevin is a victim of a very rare physical disability, and it prevents him from living a normal person's life. Kevin is a very intelligent boy, and he lives in the world of his imagination. Max is an obese boy who suffers from emotional problems and a learning disability. He has failed the seventh grade several times. The boys start becoming friends when Kevin starts helping Max with his reading skills. Here is where the journey begins. These boys have nothing in common, but they can relate to each other about being outcasts, and being abandoned by their fathers at a very early age. Kevin's magical world of knights and their journy for justice is closer to reality than the two boys might think. Through their adventures, they not only become best friends, they become brothers."
5,best thing I've ever seen,"MAGNIFICENT!! Absolutely beautiful performances brought on by those two boys!! I purchased not long ago and watch this almost every day!! And that ending, just brilliant!! I get this weird feeling every time, you know, where you just want to hold them forever, whoever is going through pain. For those who have seen this, you know what I'm talking about. Even my sisters couldn't shut up about how GORGEOUS those boys were (but hey, this is a weird family, ya know) Anyhoo, it's beautiful!! An absolute must if you have a good heart, just like I do."
3,the mighty,Kiran Culkin is such a good actor because even though he didn't have a disability it looked like he did and he performed real well and i really enjoyed it. in the beginning it was really boring but then it got better as i got into it. thats my review
4,equal to simon birch,This movie was great culkin and henson where great. I liked the book to it is very simalar to simon birch and just a good. did you know that the boy who played simon birch was orignaly going to play kevin in this movie but changed his mind.if you like culkin and henson toghter you can see them in she all that. i bought this i i hope to watch it agai and again it would make a good double feature with simon birch.
2,The Mighty,"This movie is about two kids Culkin and Ratliff. One of them is a small crippled kid named Kevin. He has an illness which means he has a disease in which his internal organs grow but his body doesn't. The other kid is Max who is a very tall boy and an outcast who can't read or study well. They become friends and form the mighty which is that Max puts Kevin on his shoulders so that Kevin doesn't need his crutches. Max describes it as, ""It was like at that moment he became my brian and I became his feet."" They bring justice and help people out with struggles. People say about them, ""That's what we call a couple of freaks."" I like the movie and I suggest you go see it becouse it helps you learn what kids like Kevin and Max are going through and how opposite pepole can become good friends."
5,A MUST SEE FOR GILLIAN FANS!,"The Mighty is an excellent film that I had been awaiting for a long time. The cast is amazing but does not let us down when it comes to the storyline. Gillian Anderson proves to naysayers that she is a phenomenal actress, Sharon Stone gives a great performance, Gena Rowlands, Meatloaf, and best of all Kieran Culkin round off this amazing movie. I was impressed by the effect this film had on me and others. I hope to encourage others to view it as soon as possible."
4,Decent first costume,"This costume was as expected. An inexpensive first costume for a baby that probably would not wear it more than 10mins anyways. If you are looking for high quality, you probably should look elsewhere but this is perfect to snap a few funny pictures in."
4,Almost Five Stars,"Great music. Awesome beats. Almost Flawless.The ""single"" contains the album version of Flawless, and four remixes. I was pleasantly surprised that each subsequent remix out performed the preceding mixes. My favorite is the 4th Boxer Mix with its thumping beats. It's a worthy addition to your CD library, but it looses a star for being expensive--five similar songs for over $12 is a bit much."
4,brilliant!,"I think this book is just terifick, it is brilliant ad I couldn't of asked for more in a book."
5,El Vez Rocks!,"Any El Vez fan's record collection is incomplete without this CD. As always, El Vez is hilarious and wonderful at twisting Elvis tunes into social commentary. El Vez, also known as the Mexican Elvis, has put together a bunch of his best songs in this compilation. But by far the best of the best songs on this CD (and my personal favorite) has to be ""Si, I am a Low Rider"" - inspired no doubt by Elvis's ""C.C. Rider."" There is nothing that you will not like on this album, nothing that will not have you smiling, and nothing that will not have you possibly dancing around your living room. This is a compilation CD, so you could find most of these songs on other albums, but this one has different versions plus some unreleased tracks. So, if it's a good time you're looking for, El Vez, as always, rocks."
3,Product Desc is incorrect! this is not a SHM-CD,"Japanese-only SHM-CD (Super High Material CD) paper sleeve pressing of this classic album from the British singer/songwriter and entertainer, originally released in 1973. SHM-CDs can be played on any audio player and delivers unbelievably high-quality sound. You won't believe it's the same CD! Includes four bonus tracks. Universal. 2008.I just received a regular CD in a jewel case. This is not what is advertised! I'm not sure I would have ordered it knowing this."
2,Elton sells out,"I'm sorry, but this album is horrible. The drastic drop in quality from the brilliant, affecting ""Honky Chateau"" LP makes it clear, in retrospect, that this is where Elton made the tacky transition from ""Artist"" to ""Entertainer"". Sure, ""Daniel"" still sounds great; but ""Have Mercy on the Criminal"" is just horrid, and ""Midnight Creeper"" is quite possibly the most embarrassing Rolling Stones imitation of all-time. And the rest just reeks of early-70s tackiness -- all dressed up in baby blue polyester suits with nowhere to go...."
1,Lousy,"""Crocodile Rock"" is surely one of the most annoying tunes ever to hit the radio, and it is the main hit on this album. OK, ""Daniel"" was also a hit, and is tolerable, but the rest of this album reeks. Elton John is vastly overrated."
5,great album,"DANIEL,CROCODILE ROCK may have been the hits but DON'T SHOOT ME is much more TEACHER I NEED YOU,ELDERBERRY WINE,BLUES FOR BABY AND ME,these are all awesome tunes the final HIGH FLYING BIRD these a just an example of some of the great tunes ELTON and BERNIE would come to write."
5,Well thought music,I really enjoy this c.d. Elton shines with High Flying Bird and Texan Love Song. Blues For My Baby And Me is a great ballad. My favorite song that was included in the remasterng is Skyline Pigeon. This is a very simple love song that any one can relate to. My complaint with the remastering of the c.d. was the liner notes with the lyrics were too small. All in all it is worth buying.
5,Classic Elton,This album includes a number of Elton's 45s that my mother and uncle listened to as kids. Good sound and quality. This is still early in Elton's career and it is interesting to see how much different he sounds in this album from more recent albums. Elton John fans should have this album.
5,Quality Product!,"Came as described, used them to adjust triggers on xbox controllers! I know it'll be forever before I need to get more, but i'd order these again in a heartbeat!"
1,Exceptionally bad,Watching this DVD I was amazed at how exceptionally bad it is: worst than amateurish. Don't waste your money!!!
1,Made me dizzy,I can't imagine anything that they could add to this documentary that could make it any worse. We turned it off after 5 minutes. Wow.
5,Don did a great job writing this outstanding book!,this is a graet book on a fantastic subject! wow I was amazed on this subject! Great truth at it's best! I am planning to let a friend read this book! I really likeed it a lot!! Great reading is sure to come! don I wanna read another book by you AGAIN!
1,Sadly inaccurate,"The historical accuracy of this book is sadly lacking.If you don't think the Confederacy (and therefore its symbol) was built on racism and slavery, read the Cornerstone Speech of Alexander Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederate States here: http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=76 .According to Stephens himself on March, 21, 1861, ""The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution - African slavery as it exists amongst us - the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution."""
5,A great book--well researched and informative.,"This is a great book on a subject that is often misunderstood. This book explains why the battle flag is a symbol of Southern heritage and pride and DOES NOT represent racism and hatred to the vast majority of people-North and South-who honor it. Most people in this country have never been taught the true history of the war--it's not in our schoolbooks. Remember, conquerors always write history as they want it to appear. It's taken over 100 years for the South to recover economically from the war. It will probably be another 100 years before the events leading to the war, the war itself, and the aftermath can be fairly evaluated without the taint of Northern bias. The events of history speak for themselves when fairly and accurately reported."
3,Somewhat dated but still valuable information for a buyer.,"For those that are thinking of buying their own airplane, this book provides valuable information on what to look for in a plane, hidden costs of ownership, Government red tape, recommendations on aircraft for beginners, and advise on determining the real condition of the aircraft before it is purchased."
2,Basic background information,"It contained some basic information. It suggested that I get an independent type machanic or expert to review the aircraft prior to purchase. Duh? Also, it provides some generic information about different types of aircraft. Look for a better book."
5,horse treats,Colorful and the horse loved all of them! Nice small package for travel. It was wonderful to have them so small for a horse on a diet but rewarding for the horse. Each piece is imprinted which is way cute.
3,It's a book,Haven't read it yet. But the processing job on the book itself was faulty...several pages were bent over and thus not trimmed properly.
4,Great Study Tool,The book and corresponding CD's are great in hearing proper pronunciation and following up with listening comprehension tools with the vocabulary list at the end of each story and the questions to determine how much was understood.
2,Excellent Performance Offset by Reliability Problems,"Small, easy to use and excellent picture quality when it worked. I have owned an Olympus Stylus Zoom for two years. Around the the end of the first year, it began having spurious light leaks. Just recently, a problem with rewinding made it necessary to open the camera and lose half of my pictures. Since then, the LCD readout has stopped working, so the exposure number and flash control are blanked out. I have to replace the camera, and am looking at other manufacturers."
5,"One of the great 20th Century artists in top form, live.","Leontyne Price sings all arias with full orchestra at the top of her career. The sound quality is very good, the audience is enthusiastic, and Leontyne delivers the goods. At the cost of this CD, its a gift! This CD would also make an excellent introduction to Opera, beautiful arias combined with etheral and passionate singing! Brava!"
5,a steal of a deal,"The selections here are from two live recitals, and Miss Price is in fine fettle. Her ""Vissi d'arte"" is perfectly placed and gorgeously sung as is ""Summertime,"" which is more beautifully rendered here than on the studio recording with her former husband, Warfield. And it's so cheap for the excellent sound (and that's high praise coming from one who hates most live recordings)."
5,Fantastic singing,Another must buy from Leontyne Price. Although recordings show their age she makes up for all the shortcomings. She is absolutely fabulous.A bargain not to be missed.
2,"Most beautiful voice, but be warn of the noise","One of the noisiest live recording that they have the nerve to release. Ms Price is glorious. But everytime she sings a high note or even a medium loud note, there is static. I'm not talking just static. I'm talking like a bad cel phone.Don't get this, rather I recommend her most fabulous Puccini Heroines which no one alive can sing better."
5,Families should read this book.,"What passes for grade school education in this country is really a conspiracy to make us subservient to government. If you have children in a public school, read this book!"
5,"Fascinating anecdotes, very good overview of period","Not many people realise the extent of these relations, from German spies roaming Ireland in WWII to German children being given a second chance in life in Ireland after the war. This book is clearly written and therefore accessible to any reader, not only historians"
2,Well,"To be frank it wasn't really my cup of tea. To be sure, it's very compelling at places and has some great information... but don't expect any characters to be happy at the end. Ever.Plot? Bright young lad goes to war over wise preants advice, two older brothers die,[...] child, horrible sluaghter, lad scared forever. Oh, and he's part of an ethnic minority.Maybe people who are in to depressing themselves would like this. It is well written. I still wouldn't recommend it."
2,very mechanical,"Before I bought this set, I read the review, somebody said they were mechanical. I didn't understand it. But after I seen it, I do. They are like robots, lacking any kind of feeling or passion. So if you are looking for passion, don't get this one. They seem like couples who have been doing it for years and don't enjoy it anymore.The performers in this dvd are people between ages 45-65. I am younger, so I was kind of disgusted watching old people having sex. So if you are young, be forewarned..."
1,Rip Off....Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my younger sister, She was unable to play one of the discs recieved. The games themseleves are not the real Carmen Sandiego games, A cheap knock=off of that sort, If not worse. I would recommend spendng the extra $$$ on somethng else, since you won't get what you ask for or pay for with this game."
4,Games is cool,"I actually bought the game for my sister, but my experience is that the Carmen Sandiego games are a lot of fun."

5,Family Farm life gloriously illuminated,"Tony Johnston weaves a simplistic farm life story that touches your soul. A gracefully written family saga that is magestically illustrated by Lloyd Bloom.The background rolls with the hills, trees and farm as the story of life changes with the seasons and years. A beginning life for a husband and wife, a growing family and encircling love for all.Parents, readers, prepare to wipe away the tears of simple joy and beauty as you share this book with a special little one.Though this book is currently listed as out of print, please try Amazon's search to find a copy, it is definately worth the effort."
5,Good book for reading to your little ones.,"Actually, I have one beef with this book: it's awfully hard not to cry.Solid construction, simple but good story, nice artwork."
3,Somewhat Amusing,"Work is bad enough, but what if things go really wrong? In this latest title from the bestselling series, the Worst-Case Scenario authors come to the rescue with expert advice for surviving dozens of nightmare on-the-job scenarios, whether in the office or on the loading dock.Everyone has had dreadful bosses, scary or annoying co-workers, and everyone has felt that they arent' qualified for at least one job for which they are interviewing. Fewer of us get to sneak out of meetings.. although many would love to!, or how to get out of various small places one could get trapped in. Things you may learn from this book are how to get jobs without experience, survive in a storeroom ""avalanche,"" escape from a boring meeting, what to do if your tie gets caught in the paper shredder, and many more."
2,Right in the middle of ......,"I bought the ""original"" ""The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook"". I loved its humor and so I gave this one a try. I cant say it's bad. However, it's somehow much more serious than the original one, thus less humorous and fun. The problem is: it's not indepth nor detailed enough to cover, in my opinion as a white collar for over 15 years, 1/5 of the common difficulties in an office.In short, if you really wanna improve your survival opportunities in your job, there are many better alternatives in a bookstore. If you just wanna have fun, this is definitely not a good choice. Therefore, not recommended. If you really wanna buy it, I sincerely suggest you to read the ""See sample pages"" here on Amazon for a quick look of what those ""tips"" refer to."
2,Entertaining but less informative than the original Worst Case Book,"Nice book on job interviews and surviving the workplace. Advice on how to set up your cubicle and common sense items on what to wear.Some tongue in cheek parts though. Such as the section: ""How to Get a Job You're not Qualified For"". I hope nobody gets the Brain Surgeon job using the advise in this book!Good advice such as staying positive during a job interview and answer confidently is addressed here.Liked the area on how to disguise tattoos and how to fake tattoos if needed as well.This book has some good information ,but is slated more toward corporate America, where you have a set dress code, and work in cubicles."
5,Worst Case Scenario: Having to Return This Book,"I have the first two worst-case scenario books and when I saw this one, I was very excited. This book continues the tradition of the series by offering detailed, and often humorous, instructions on things that may happen to you at work.Things you may learn from this book are how to get jobs without experience, survive in a storeroom ""avalanche,"" escape from a boring meeting, what to do if your tie gets caught in the paper shredder, and many more.This book is very funny and quite interesting. A must pick-up book if you have a job or are a fan of the series."
5,The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook - Work,This book is hysterical and good reading material to pick up when you are having a bad day. Good to give to a co-worker or enjoy yourself. Many of the scenarios I can relate to.
5,GREAT BOOK!!,"I love romances, I'm a fan of them. I specially liked this book because the girl was the strong one, the one who could shoot, the one that could ride the horse. I really liked her doing the Gray Shadow part. I really recomend this book to everyone."
1,A complete waste of time,"This book has nothing to recommend it. There is no plot, no character development and no romance. Don't bother with this one!!"
5,Everything you could want...wonderful!,"Adam and Nichole's story was the last of the McLain books I read of the three brothers but at the top of the list for favorites. Melt my heart. Adam and Nichole were a perfect match for one another. I loved how feisty Nichole was and how she interacted with all the brothers. It was fun watching them become a family and the respect the brothers came to have for Nick, as well as truly liking her almost from the beginning. There were a number of funny scenes that made me chuckle between Nick and the brothers, especially the ones were the brothers tried to make Adam jealous. You could tell Nichole was made to be part of this family almost from the beginning. These were two wonderful, passionate characters and the supporting characters were an added bonus. Another keeper and one I won't soon forget."
2,Texan's Touch,"I bought this book party because it had so many positive reveiws. This is the second book that I have read by this author and both times I was very disappointed. I just don't feel any connection to the characters, the plot is not interesting and it I had to push myself to finish the book. It seems like ideas and subplots are introduced that go no where. And so many things are put into the book, that it is confusing and crowded. I really can't figure out what everone else is seeing that I don't. I have read many western romances and these just dont stack up. I have one more book by this author that I already bought so I'll read it and see if it holds my interest."
4,So much fun in 2-3 hours,"I had the priviledge of performing this musical my senior year of high school (I graduated May 2003) and I had the wonderful, yet exhausting and difficult, opportunity to play Edwin Drood. This musical is so much fun to perform and you can't keep the music out of your head- even if you wanted to. Betty Buckley is FABULOUS as is...everyone in this show. Seriously. And for girls needing an audition song, ""Moonfall"" is a gorgeous choice for a good soprano. Lovely lovely lovely. It's just a great show with a variety of songs that are all fun and wonderful. Love it! :o)"
4,Surprisingly Amazing,"I was fortunate to have appeared in my high school's performance of Drood this year, as the Princess Puffer. It was my first show and in the beggining I was annoyed that the director had not chosen a more well known musical. However, as I read the script and listened to the music I really did fall in love with the show. It is so original and catchy that I often found myself singing it all the time. It is worth is to buy and listen to. It has become one of my all time favorites and might become one of yours."
3,"Not as ""sturdy"" as I thought it would be","This might keep some leaves out, but it sure isn't strong enough for many leaves and I have a large tulip tree that sheds lots of leaves. Disappointing."
1,poor quality,I purchased these shoes for my 14 month old; days after they arrived they started to fall apart. My toddler did not wear them daily nor did she wear them outside! they are cute shoes but the sides appeared to be leather and they are not.
5,New Album?!,"I'm really confused... this was a new album 12 years ago. Yes, it is still an excellent, superb album. Goodbye is magnificent and listening to it with a hi fi stereo system is incredible. You vividly feel Dianne singing only for you. Her voice seems to be there, in front of you, whispering in your ears. Mista is also amazing and, yes, River with her is the definitive recording. With all said, I'm still eagerly waiting for her truly new album."
4,WHAT JAZZ USED TO BE!,"Reeves jump-starts the post-war Jazz Club scene like no other in recent memory. Her vocals are clear and perfectly drawn. One can smell the linger of stale beer and smoke as she wakes you politely on Sunday morning. Perhaps a little awkward at times (I wish I wouldn't have said that, because I think she's great!)."
5,Babette and my Granddad--a true tale,"Due to having a ""one cat"" apartment, after BABETTE had been completed, my mother took Babette to live with her own parents in Flint, MI. As Clare told the story, ""At first, my rather taciturn father regarded Babette with skepticism and said','She looks like a weasel! Of course, my mother loved Babette. However, Babette had made up her mind to win Dad and followed him around,looking up at him as if to say 'You great big wonderful man!'In a few days, I noticed Daddy edging over on his chair to make room for Babette. Before I'd left he'd get up in the middle of the night to make sure she was covered in her basket. I've just had a letter saying that he now takes her walking on a leash, and doesn't care a whoop what the neighbors think of that!""Both Babette and Mittens spent their retirement years living with my grandparents in their cozy little house. I am glad BABETTE is newly printed--even if it is listed as ""out of print,"" it is brand-new."
5,Classic Book with Beautiful Illustrations,"I first became familiar with Clare Newberry's books a couple of years ago when a lady came into the Barnes & Noble store where I work looking for 'Babette,' which was read to her as a little girl (at least some 40 years prior). At that time, the book was still out of print, but for some reason, this lady's request stuck in my mind.I was very excited when I saw that 'Babette' and other Newberry titles had been reissued and were on display in our store. I love cats, and the charcoal illustrations in these books are simply precious (I have made my coworkers sick, gushing over them as I do!). I figure any book that someone will actively seek out after 40 or more years is a bona fide gem. I have since collected all of Newberry's cat books (Smudge, Mittens, April's Kittens...). Young cat & kitten lovers will especially prize these beautiful books!"
4,"As good as any product of this type, but not a solution.","My wife has had a problem with the skin on her fingertips cracking for several years. She has tried many products and techniques for dealing with this situation. She has also been to several doctors and read many articles. Nothing seems to be a significant cure or treatment. She does use rubber gloves anytime washing dishes, etc. She regularly puts moisturizers on her hands during the day and at night she also uses ointment on her hands and covers them with white cotton gloves. This product is as good as any, but did not resolve her cracking skin problems."
5,Miracle Cure,"This stuff really does work wonders. When you tried every lotion on the market & nothing helps, give this stuff a try. You think i'm crazy now... It's has a strong herbal scent & it's not even a cream (as the name suggests) but I have twice seen it clear up chronic cracked, chapped & peeling skin in a matter of days. I recommend it highly. It's not expensive & one bottle lasts a long time. & yes, it is nearly impossible to find in stores."
5,Zim's Crack Creme - Thank you for carrying this!,"I have been unable to find the liquid Zim's crack creme anywhere in my area on a regular basis in years - this product is the best for all kinds of dry skin on hands, feet, elbows or even problem patches on legs or arms. My husband works with floor chemicals and his hands have had deep cracks that turn black and cannot heal without this product. My skin in the winter becomes dry and cracks so painfully on my finger-tips and knuckles and this product heals them. I heard about it on AM radio years ago and swear by it. I am now ordering several at a time because stores around here just don't have it. Great product!"
1,Crack cream not cream,"This product was not as pictured, received a spray. Wanted the cream as photo shows. Spray does not work. Drips everwhere"
5,Challenging but worth effort.,"I really love this type of puzzle. It's educational and sharpens ones knowledge of regional wildscapes and habitat. Good to do before, during or after visiting area. I wish the puzzle maker, ceaco, would include printed small poster w/legend on back as a separte item like they use too. The back of box legend is very small requiring a magnifying glass for these old folks like me."
2,Duane becomes a granola liberal and everyone dies.,"And suddenly they were all run over by a bus . . . The moral is: to avoid a similar fate diet, exercise and eat plenty of fresh vegetables. Duane pays thousands to a psychiatrist who advises him to read Jackie O's favorite novelist. It takes a lot of time even if the lightbulb wants to change. Ho hum . . ."
2,Deja vu - Lonesome Dove,"Is it just me, or does anyone else see Duane as a modern version of Woodrow Call? I can imagine Woodrow doing everything Duane does, saying everything Duane says, and thinking everything Duane thinks. Even Duane's task of reading Proust mirrors Woodrow's hauling Gus back to Texas.I was also disappointed in that so many of Duane's acquaintances are eccentrics. Pervasive eccentricity is believable in the context of frontier Texas; it is not in modern America.And finally, Woodrow/Duane just aren't interesting without Gus. ""Duane's Depressed"" lacks a Gus."
2,Duane's depressed....,".......and so am I, after reading this. Well, almost reading it. I gave up in the middle. Yaaawwwn. Too bad McMurtry has lost his touch. I read the two reviews preceding mine but found I totally disagreed with their opinions. I, too, had previously read The Last Picture Show and Texasville. I've seen the movies that go with the books. I adore Jeff Bridges and had always thought he made a terrific Duane. I like quirky characters as much as the next reader but I didn't connect with any of the ones in this book. The little kids were big-mouthed brats, their ""parents"" had never grown up and probably never would. I had always liked Karla and Duane but I just didn't feel anything for them. Maybe I'll just re-read Lonesome Dove, my all-time favourite McMurtry. This new book just didn't ""do it for me."""
2,"Has literary pretensions, but isn't a good read","Reading any of McMurtry's sequels is a pointless exercise. They may have literary merit, but for those of us who just want to read the next installment, they are merely one big down. His earlier novels created memorable characters we cared about; his later works dispose of them with reckless abandon. How 90's!"
4,"Inside one man's head, for 500 pages","Duane woke up one morning and just decided to walk. He didn't ride in a car again for about 3 years. The thing is, this was just not normal behavior for a successful Texas oilman, and everyone had a hypothesis about what was bothering Duane. Duane himself couldn't really explain it. Thus Duane's Depressed : A Novel is author Larry McMurtry's exploration into the mind of Duane.It is part light comedy, part serious reflection, and part Henry David Thoreau (you have to read it to understand).Duane goes through a LOT during the 3 years of this book. The reader will grow and explore with him.I think this is part of a trilogy, but this is the only book in the series that I read. It stands alone very well."
2,Not what I expected from Larry,"Followed Abbey's ""Fools Progress"" with this little one day read. After a couple of times hearign about the one ball, I had enough. Did you know that Ken Starr is from Thalia?"
4,You have to love McMurtry,"To me, the author wrote this book for his fans; not so much to be #1 on the best-seller list. Having felt like I've known Duane, Ruth, and Sonny since the early 70s, it was like reading about old friends. McMurtry is unparalleled with his use of the English language in the way he paints pictures with the characters' thoughts and dialogue. All of his characters are so real - perhaps quirky, but real. There are a number of laugh-out-loud moments in this book as well as a couple of heart-in-your-throat ones. McMurtry fans, enjoy this one! Newer readers may want to begin with another of his masterpieces. (""Horseman, Pass By"" is a great start.)"
4,a fitting end to a well loved trilogy,"Living in the area that McMurtry hails from and writes about in the Duane Moore trilogy has made me a bit biased in regards to this series. I never-the-less found each of the books in this series to be entertaining and well written. This last book has given a fitting end to characters that we have come to love and feel for. The characters each have traits that many of us can relate too. Duanes depression and Karla's attempts to understand and the reaction of the children and grandchildren all combine to make this a wonderful story. And even if you don't find it to be a story that you would want to reread in the future, it will definately make you realize that no matter how hard to live with your own kids are, that they are not so bad compared with Duane and Karla's kids and grandkids."
2,Read Everything Else First,"Lonesome Dove is one of my favorite books of all time and I have enjoyed all of his other books (Terms of Endearment, Comanche Moon, Buffalo Girls, Anything for Billy, Streets of Laredo, etc) however I had trouble finishing Duane's Depressed. The first half of the book rolled along but the second half became unbearably slow. I felt like I was reading a character study by James Joyce.This book did not have the memorable characters characteristic of McMurtry novels. Imagine Lonesome Dove being a character study of Woodrow Call, it certainly would not win a Pulitzer. Maybe I prefer the Lonesome Dove saga better. I still recommend this book to those who love the Texasville series but for first time Larry McMurtry readers, try reading Lonesome Dove or Terms of Endearment before you read this book."
4,Bought for use playing Draw Something,"I've become a big fan of the game ""Draw Something"" and thought it might be nice to have a stylus to help me draw or write on my Galaxy Nexus phone. This stylus absolutely works on the screen, but I don't think it helps much with my intended purpose. The tip of this stylus is squishy, and for the contact to register on the screen, the tip must be completely squished. You have to press a little harder than feels natural. Also, the tip isn't very fine, so I end up drawing thin lines with the same unpredictability experienced with using a finger. I still like the stylus and perhaps with more practice it will be a superior writing implement.This does come with an audio jack tether, but the cord is too short to keep the stylus attached while using it on the screen. It's still nice to have to keep the stylus with the phone in your purse or pocket.I love the long length and slim line of this stylus. Mimics writing with a pen or pencil."
4,Like Mary Chapin Carpenter?,"Then you will like Carrie Newcomer. Deep, rich vocals and nice, melancholic lyrics. This is a solid CD. From the first to the last tune, you will appreciate her luxurious voice. Take a gamble! You will win"
4,A True Storyteller,"A year ago, I'd never heard of Carrie Newcomer. A local college radio station played one of her songs, and I was hooked. I now own a half dozen of her albums. Her music always puts me in a good mood.Angel on My Shoulder is probably not as polished as some of the more recent recordings, but don't let that put you off. There is an honesty to the sound, to the lyrics, to the arrangements. In my opinion, Newcomer is a consummate storyteller, weaving music around little slices of everyday life and yet always having a strong undercurrent of optimism and gentle strength."
3,Isn't it what's inside that counts?,"I own a 15"" KLH Loudspeaker, I made the purchase a long time ago before I knew much about audio, (whooo, 15"", 300W, and a Liquid cooled tweeter to boot what could be cooler?)Hmm, lets open it up and take a lookThe magnet assymbley on the 15"" woofer is smaller then the magnet on my 6.5"" Midwoofer in my car stereo, wires going to the speakers must be 24ga. (extremely thin) the cross-over also looks pitiful, but hey, for that price what can you expect? At least the box is pretty beefy ;)Screachy high's dull mid's sloppy bass w/absolutly no punch...I plan to Replace these speakers with Cerwin-Vega's AL-750 or AL-1000 but cannot find a dealer!Ok, mabye I'm being a little harsh, the last review on this page is very acurate..."
1,Junk speaker,"This is less than a ""budget"" speaker, this is junk. Do not waste your money on this, or the JBL that Amazon.com calls ""mid-priced."" It is also junk. The starting point in your search for speakers should be the NHT that is listed ""best."" This is a very good speaker, one that will give you hours of enjoyment. I guarantee that if you buy this KLH speaker, you will tire of it quickly, but think that you are merely bored with ""stereo."" You are really the victim of bad, bad stereo equipment."
4,Loudest Dorm Room EVER,"I bought a pair of these ...just cuz they were dirt-cheap for the pair. I've already ordered a pair of KLH AV5001s (still waitin for them) but these were delivered to me at school first. I've got them hooked up to my Pioneer 4x150 watt receiver, and it's ridiculous with these two ""smaller"" speakers. I have this all hooked up to my computer, and already people are asking me to DJ for their parties. I can't even IMAGINE how it will sound when my AV5001s arrive...."
1,Speakers prone to damage in shipment,"I can't attest to the sound of these speakers because I never got to use them. The orignial pair I ordered arrived damaged, as did the replacement pair. The factory packing is so poor that the probability of them withstanding shipment of any distance without damage seems remote. Amazon was very good about refunding my money, but this was a major hassle. Check with Amazon about packing before ordering."
3,Not bad!,These speakers are NOT for serious listeners. For the price they are a good second system choice. The bass is not tight or well defined. The treble is a bit weak. The mids are very pronounced. Would be well suited for background music or a teenager wanting 'Bigger Speakers' for their room.
4,T Fal X large fry pan,"I saute lots of vegetables every week and feel that a 12"" fry pan is just not large enough to move them around easily without making a mess. Being 13.5 inches in diameter, this pan give me some extra room for stirring and turning. The sides are nice and high too. It's also very easy to clean!"
2,Warped,"The bottom of the pan gets warped after a couple months of regular use. Now the center of the pan is higher than the outer edges. I have never washed the pan with cold water while it's piping hot, I always let it cool down before washing. Even with this precaution, it still get warped considerably. It's not only annoying to cook with uneven surface, its also reducing the effectiveness of heat transfer from my flat electric stove. Now it takes forever for the pan to get hot due to bad surface contact.I have a different T-fal pan which has thicker material, and that one does not warp at all. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,"T-FAL 13.5"" FRY PAN","MY HUSBAND DOES MOST OF THE COOKING AND ABOUT A YEAR AGO I BOUGHT OUR FIRST T-FAL FRY PANS, THE 3 PIECE SET, SOLD ON AMAZON. HE LIKED THEM SO WELL WE HAVE ADDED A COUPLE LARGER ONES WHICH HE LIKES EVEN BETTER. HE LIKES THE ROOMIER, LARGE SKILLETS THE BEST. IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT."
5,Great Frying Pan!!,The frying pan is very versatile. The size of the pan lets you cook more at one time. I have been able to cook two large steaks in the same pan which usually need two pans to prepare. The pan is also very easy to clean. Very sticky food is cleaned off very easily.I have tried other brands of frying pans and have always returned to T-fal.
5,Perfect,"I love T-fal brand cookware. It is durable, non stick coating is perfect, and cooks well. This pan is on par with all other T-fal cookware.Highly recommend."
5,Biggest fry pan ever,I ordered this because I was having company and we were having salmon steaks and I needed a pan big enough for eight med. steaks and my 9 and 10 inch pans would not work. This one sure did. And the T-Fal line has always been a favorite of mine. It even looks nice hanging up on my pot rack. Great pan at a great price!!!
3,Lid?,I really like this pan but my husband is unhappy that it doesn't have a lid. I've tried to find a universal lid. The only one I've found was $50 - seriously?
2,"Just didn't care for this pan, high spot in center.","I've bought 3 of the T fal pans w/ the red dot centers. And each one is higher in the center and lower on the edges. When you put oil into the pan, it all goes to the outside. To have oil in the center you would have to have way too much that would accumulate on the edges. This pan went w/ my other older pans for my sons to use when they have bon fires."
4,Look USA....Europe is dropping Bombs!,"So this is their 2nd Release, and I will have to say this release brings everything their first album didn't. Some of the things I like about this band is how they Rock Bluz their songs up. Jaded Heart starts off the album and you can immediately hear the Bluz they bring....and bring it they do. Louder the 2nd song lives up to what you'd think when you hear LOUD and HARD anthem type music! And again, the guitar solo classic bluz...these guys rock! Not to bore one with a critique of the album....this release is well worth the price, as is their 1st album, and their 3rd. Stop reading and starting clicking...& BUY IT ALREADY!"
2,Not so good,This might be a good bit but it is so unbalanced that I was not able to use it in the cnc router due to heavy vibrations.
1,Bitter Almonds:Recollections and Recipes from a Sicilian Girlhood,"The product arrived with numerous pages missing in the book. I filed a claim, was offered another book in exchange since they were out of this title. I asked for another book which ended up not being available so requested my money back and was given a credit on my card. While the merchandise was damaged, I have to say the resolution was swift and to my satisfaction. So the product gets one star but the resolution process gets five stars."
3,Remarks from a Sicilian Girl,"I have just returned from Sicily where I visited Maria's shop and saw the convent where her childhood was spent. I wish I would have read the book before my visit. The smell of almond pastries led me right up the narrow street and to the pastries and candies in her shop, and they are marvelous. The convent is just a short walk up the street from her shop, in the square. The recipes she shares in the book are uncomplicated and simply delicious. Her story is not embellished. There is no polished prose. It is as she saw it and lived it and has told it with her unique Sicilian expression. I enjoyed reading it and I will continue to enjoy her recipes."
1,kinda mad,"in short i came in the mail, i was super pumped and the game didnt play. extremely disappointing experience. ."
5,good,"got this in like a few days, feels real sturdy, and the teeth dont scratch your scalp, and theyre pretty strong. 10/10 would reccommend,and btw this is the clipper mate one amazon sells as an add on but cheaper c:"
5,"Intriguing, wise, and re-readable","This is one of my favorite novels. If it came out now, it would probably be called ""chick lit"" but it's better than most young women's contemporary fiction. Klass has a strong voice, a perceiving eye, and a sense for real life that makes this novel a pleasure to read. And anyone who's ever had an office crush and idly speculated about what ""could"" happen....you'll enjoy it."
1,Radio Rodent-could be fun if it worked well,Our cat loves the Radio Rodent but it does not work well. We e-mailed/phoned customer service whom did not respond. (1 month plus)Because it does not work well I would say it is a waste of money.
2,The mouse that wants to...but can't.,"This mouse is loved by the cat, and I was fine with the fact that it ran on short charges. First the female receptacle on the mouse where you insert the charger plug fell too deep inside the mouse to charge it, so I opened the mouse up and taped the receptacle back into place. Not a big deal. Next the one wheel seized up and now the mouse only goes backward or forward in circles, or I can still make it flip using the tail twirl button. So even when it's not working properly, the look on the cat's face waiting for it to charge up or watching it flip is priceless."
2,It's OK,"I am a bit disappointed in this purchase. While the cat likes to play with it, it doesn't hold a charge for very long. So about the time she gets interested, I have to re-charge it."
3,Celtic fusions,"Modern Celtic instrumental music. Has some good examples of what I call ""Stutter step"" in the accordian early in the album. She mixes traditional instrumentation with non-traditional instrumentation, and keeps the composition traditional feeling. Some of the songs, as a result, approach a jazz or rock feel."
5,:-),"The service was unbelievably easy, and the product was shipped sooo fast! Thank you! This was my first purchase but it won't be my last"
4,Suspense and History,"This is the first of four books that are written from Pramoedya Ananta Toer's imprisonment - he spent his years in prison telling this story to his fellow prisoners, and wrote it all down when he got out.Just imagine being imprisoned on a cruel island with the ironic name of Buru (bird). Then imagine Mr. Toer telling you and other prisoners a long story about a young man's political awakening, Indonesia's colonial history - years, days, places, players - and a whole host of other fascinating characters. Complete with suspense and romance, this the first of four long books that contain the whole story of Minke. In each cliffhanger, you can sense where Mr. Toer had to stop telling his story, leaving his captive audience hanging on for the next day..."
4,A must read for every Indonesian,"I'm from the same village as Mr. Toer, in fact, I was born only a mile away from his family home in Blora. My uncle went to school with him, my mom went to school with his sister and I went to school with his nephew. Since his exile, his family disowned him and I only heard bad things about him. But being in the US, I'm able to get access to the ban books in Indonesia and have been rewarded from reading his books. This book is a start of an ""anti-christ"" series that exposes our bad sides honestly. This, and the following books, clearly narrates the dutch rule in the late 1800 and early 1900 that is used in the exact same manner by Suharto during his rule (i.e. oppression). It also brings out our (esp. Javanese) bad character, submissiveness, in a painful but awakening way. So, for my fellow Indonesians, read this book as an instrospect! You will be stressed out for awhile but enlightment is on its way."
5,An amazng literary accomplishment,"I loved the first three of this series. The fourth book is good, but a bit slower. I could not put these down. The first novel starts out a bit slow (first forty pages) and then takes off with such rich characters and narrative that I was transported. I learned a great deal about the period, colonialism from a native perspecive and the Indonesian history. In my mind he's one of the greats."
4,best for older children,"Great take on the classic story wtih really unique illustrations that are multi-media looking. However, best suited for older children or moms/dads may want to give a condensed version at bedtime as this version is long; probably more than what mom or dad want to read at bedtime..."
4,Product as described. :),"The item was received timely in the manner described. I was pleased with the purchase. This is an adorable book with fun, colorful pictures."
5,a fairy tale frolic,"This book is so much fun to read out loud. Illustrated with dollhouse rooms and cut-paper people, every page is visually interesting. The longer text makes this book interesting for older children, and the repetition and the fancy fonts give you something to work on as you read this to your family.Oh! The folding on the gowns and the draperies - artistry! And the page where the prince notices that ""certain something"" about the princess ... that page is lit with a spotlight effect. I love that."
5,Superb!,"I am stumbling over what great thing to list first. The incredibly vivid format? The gorgeous and unique blend of intricate dollhouse set creation and illustrations? The deft reinterpretation of what it means to be a REAL princess (as opposed to a cloying, vapid Disney princess), to say nothing of finding a life partner? The great vocabulary and lilt of the words as you read it? The joy of reading this story with a daughter or several little girls? Lauren Child makes this tale something totally magical but wonderfully grounded. Can't recommend it highly enough."
2,Not a fan of the art style,"The story is basically the same, but my family did not appreciate the art. It was a real turn off to us. It's a little hard to explain, but it just felt strange and distracting. It's not horrible, we just didn't like it. To each their own I guess."
2,WORK,"THIS BOOK IS ALMOST FOR ADULTS. I HAVE TO PARAPHRASE IT SO MUCH FOR MY CHILD THAT, AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN I'M THE MOST EXHAUSTED, THIS BOOK IS TOO MUCH WORK. MY CHILD ENJOYED THE PHOTO'S BUT YOU CAN'T READ IT WORD FOR WORD. IT'S VERY WORDY AND OVER KIDS' HEADS."
4,MORE THAN ADEQUATE,This is a good beginners dictionary. We use it for high school Spanish 1. There are still some words that are not in here so sometimes we have to use internet or library for back up for homework. Nevertheless what's needed for basic conversation and translations is here.
4,Terrific Offering of Folk Music,"This compilation of folk music from the Martha's Vineyard Singer/Songwriters' Retreat provides an excellent range of music. There are traditional social issue songs but also a wonderful smattering of humorous songs, too. I bought it two years ago. I still listen to it and I buy it for others."
1,Useless piece of garbage...,"I wish I could give this -5 stars. This is a bloated software with bugs. I ran this software for 4 days, looked at the memory useage and it was a whopping 640MB !!! Yes this one program was using that much memory. So I shut it down and restarted it again. At start it uses about 12MB of Memory. I left the computer on overnite and no one was using it and in the morning it was using 64-68 MB or memory. It is leaking memory like crazy.2. Another problem ..It has a list of sites that you cannot use proxy on. eg, yahoo.com requires cookie's set, etc. After a reboot the whole list is gone. Now I have to manually enter these.3. It is slow....slow........ssssssssssssssslllllllllooooooowwwwwDon't waste your money on this. Donate to charity instead."
3,Learning to Read and Write,"This book was required for a class in Early Literacy for early childhood teachers. It has a brief overview of the basics of teaching young children early literacy skills. For someone with no previous knowledge of this, it would probably be helpful. I think too much space was spent on the position statement which reviews the decisions made about teaching children. However, this book was published by NAEYC, ao I understand why their statement was included. I have seen better, more extensive books with more ready-to-use ideas."
2,Terrible Upconversion,"So I hooked this up with both component, which doesn't use upconversion, only progressive, and hdmi, which does. I first tested the upconversion at 480, then switched to 720p, then 1080i (the highest my tv will go) I couldn't tell a difference between any of them. I thought that the upconversion seemed more grainy than my old dvd player, so I switched back and forth between component and hdmi, I got a considerably better picture with the component (which was far better than my old dvd player. It was basically a waste of money to buy an upconverting dvd player with this one. I'm returning it for a Denon upconverting dvd player that the Crutchfield rep told me has better upconversion. It is a really cool looking dvd player though. If you don't care about upconversion, it isn't a bad player, but if you want more of an HD picture, pass this one up."
1,Avoid This Player,"Shipping was fast, packaging wasn't damaged when received. The DVD player out of the box just doesn't work. Sometimes it won't even register that there's a DVD in the drive, sometimes it'll load it up and then just lose the DVD, stopping all playing. Only one in every ten DVDs will be successful in playing and it's a cross-your-fingers situation with it finishing the entire movie. This has happened since the first disc was put into the system and a few of the DVDs I've tested have been brand new. Perhaps this is just my luck, but from my experience I'm saying: Do not purchase this product."
3,Good socks run large and bulky,"I am a huge fan of Smartwool and was excited to see them in my son's size. However, my son wears a size 10 shoe and these socks were definitely large on him. Also, although they say ""light,"" they are in fact quite bulky. As a result, my son's shoes don't actually fit on over these socks. On the up side, they will fit him for a couple years, and will be great in snow boots. For wearing inside regular school shoes in winter, I would recommend the Smartwool Saturnsphere sock, which we also purchased. It is still a bit too big, but it fits inside his shoes."
5,Plush and warm,Love these socks especially for winter boots (either galoshes or snow boots!) Not sure what else to say about socks but I have to write at least 8 more words. :)
5,Great...& cozy!,"These socks are perfect for my 5 year old. Super soft and stretchy so she can easily slip them on herself. Some wool and thermal socks are so tight you have to struggle to yank them on! Not these. They're also warm, not hot and sweaty, and very nice colors. A great buy."
5,great for hiking!,These soft wool socks are great for hiking and keeping feet dry even when they perspire. They are durable and thick enough to provide some cushion without being overly bulky. Goodbye cotton socks!
3,wool socks,These were socks we needed for my daughter to wear at Yosemite on a school fiedlt rip - they worked well.
5,Dear Claude Miller,"Dear Claude Miller,We love you very very much. You helped us to see 'the dark side of the world'. Please do not leave us! Please try to tell us another 'dark' stories."
4,Half Pint Brawlers,"I saw a couple of midget martial artists going at tit in Thailand, very entertaining. Thought maybe this was that. It wasn't, but it was okay."
1,Do NOT waste your money on this!!!,"(1 star because they won't let me vote negative 5!)This 2 DVD set is WAY overpriced for what it is. I got both of them for free when I ordered the entire series from Panther (A much better series,though this art pretty much requires 1-on-1 instruction). I'm glad I got them for free, because I would have felt extrememly gipped otherwise.They name some thechinques, but no explanation is given on how to do them. The camera work looks like it was shot on a handheld 8mm. All in all, they're just taped Capoeria classes with no instruction. I will admit, when you CAN see through the grainy picture,some of the Capoeristas are very good,but not good enough to warrant the proce of this poorly shot and produced jump-on-the-bandwagon peice of garbage."
4,Best shoe I have bought in a long time,"So I went to my local outlet today and got these shoes. I LOVE them. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because they are NOT true to size. I had to buy one half size larger than normal. They have these great nubby things on the bottom that flex when you walk. It's like wearing massaging gel insoles on the outside! They are so comfy. If you are into the new low profile shoes, these are perfect. They are a bit snug through the widest part of my feet and that concerned me. But after wearing them all day, it's a good snug- like my feet are being nicely cradled. These are my new shopping shoes!"
5,Hot and Spicy Sauce to die for,I just love this sauce it has a really deep flavor without being too hot. The natural smoke of the Chipotle peppers is fantastic on grilled chicken. But my favorite is slow baked beef short ribs in this sauce - you will get raves from your family!
4,Not the next Ozark Mountain Daredevils,"and that's a good thing. I bought this album for the silliest of reasons: I've been to Ha Ha Tonka State Park in Missouri (an interesting place). Before sitting down to listen, I'm wondering if they sound like the Ozark Mountain Daredevils or Wilco? The answer is neither. Ha Ha Tonka stands on their own. Their truncated a capella cover of Led Zeppelin's Gallows Pole, called Hangman, put shivers up my neck.I bet that I listen to Buckle many, many times. I hope they come to St. Louis soon."
1,"Repetitious, Repetitious, Repetitious","An astonishingly successfull attempt to take a one-page idea and repeat it enough to create an entire book. The author's premise is valid: Human beings who have looked at the earth from space return with a different view of of our planet not only literally, but philosophically as well. However, rather than expand on this idea, he simply repeats it. Page, after page, after page. I stuck with the book hoping the last section containing interviews with space travelers would redeem the work, but each interview was merely a copy of the first, which went something like this: ""When I first glimpsed the earth from space, I was overwhelmed with its beauty. I gained a sense of how everything on earth was interconnected, and I knew I would never look at life the same way again"". Save your money, and read this review a couple of hundred times for the same ""Overview Effect"" as you would receive from the book."
1,Just plain awful,"_________________________________________Speaking plainly, this is a wretched book. White's commentary is dull, pretentious and stupefyingly repetitious. The snippets of interviews with astronauts are short, scattershot and basically worthless. The book was inexplicably recommended by Lynn Margulis, which is why I tried it. Avoid, avoid!Truth in reviewing: I didn't come close to finishing this turkey. Trust me, you don't even want to start it.Sadly,Peter D. Tillman"
2,Worse RTA furniture I have ever purchased,"I bought this dresser at Big Lots for my granddaughter after searching online. The instructions were hard to understand, the holes would not line up in the right places, and what's more, the particle board disintegrated and the fasteners designed to hold the top onto the dresser were an absolute joke. When the dresser fell apart two weeks after my 8 year old granddaughter started using it, we took the drawers and used them as storage boxes under her bed so that my money would not be a total loss. I have put together many pieces of RTA furniture over the years, and this one was about as awful as it gets."
1,This toy is crap,"This toy is terrible. Bad sculpt, and it leans over soooo far, it looks like it's going to fall! It's terrible! A total waste of money, don't buy it!"
3,Needs work,Upon receiving this piece I was slightly disappointed with the actual detailing of the Tall Man's face. The cardboard backing of the packaging and what is packaged are two different pieces. The look of the toy/collectable on the backing looks great. The one that actually comes inside leaves a lot to be desired.That being said the rest of the overall theme is great. The detailing on the little dwarf minion is awesome and having the portal used adds a nice effect along with the sphere. A must for any fan and or for your Halloween decor.
5,Fantastic,I had been looking for this for a very long time. Needless to say Christmas is over but I still don't get tired of listening to it. All the Cartwright's had such a beautiful voice. Thank you Amazon.
4,Perfect for holiday memories!,"I absolutely love this cd!! I grew up listening to the record, then the cassette and now finally the cd each Christmas. It brings back great memories of the past and always brings a smile to my face! So happy it keeps living long after everyone on the album is gone."
5,Great Cd,"The Bonanza Christmas cd is AWESOME! Totally worth buying, getting to hear them sing classic Christmas Carols while also throwing in some goofy ones."
3,Blast from the past,"We had this album when I was growing up and our family enjoyed it a lot. I purchased the CD for my siblings and we have all enjoyed some fond memories of Christmas at home when we were kids. Not the best vocals but a fun CD for your collection, especially, if you were a Bonanza fan."
4,Great memories,"Actually found this while looking for another album and couldn't pass up the great price. If you loved Bonanza, or still do, it's easily worth the price."
5,Bonanza: memories,"Ok, when I was 20 years old, I never missed a Bonanza adventure.It was a long time ago....It is awesome hearing them singing Christmas carols.Thank you!"
1,"Merry Christmas, Paw!","On this album, the friends and neighbors of the Cartwrights visit them for a Christmas Eve party. Songs are sung, and stories are told. Unfortunately, the only Cartwright that could sing, Pernell Roberts, barely appears on the album. He doesn't attend the party, and is only heard in a flashback to last year's Christmas party, singing ""The Newborn King"". The other actors aren't very good singers, with Dan Blocker being especially bad. This CD is for serious Bonanza fans only."
3,Wow,I don't believe I bought this. But I did. I must have been in a fit of peak and had some extra cash.
5,Bonanza Original TV Cast: Christmas on the Ponderosa,"I've been looking & looking, and thanks amazon, I found it. I am the youngest of eight in our family. Christmas on the Ponderosa is a classic that my family grew up with. I'm proud to keep the tradition alive."
3,"OK, OK","it probably doesn't deserve 3 stars, really...BUT what Baby Boomer could resist picking up Christmas on the Ponderosa?And doesn't that little kid inside you still love Ben Cartwright and the boys????And how could you not want to hear Hoss sing????Just too kitsch to resist!"
4,A Good Lesson Book!,I like the layout of the book with practical application and guidelines for practicing the forms.
1,Not compatible with Windows XP,"Beware!! You cant use this program if you have or upgrade to Windows XP! Voyettra website states that ther is no patch or download available. But, they do recommend spending the extra 29.00 to upgrade to the ""Deluxe"" version so that you can use it in XP. This is from their website... ""If you're using Windows XP we would recommend upgrading to ""Teach Me Piano Deluxe"" on our website:"" Very poor customer support. I guess Ill be buying software from another company from now on."
1,VOYETRA SELLS OLD INCOMPATIBLE COPIES - BEWARE,"If you buy this program, it may not run on the systems that it is purported too. They promote a new version of their product on their web site and then sell old versions through dealers that are incompatible. Then when you contact support about the problem they tell you that you should have bought it direct from them if you wanted a copy of the software that would run on the computers they claim it does."
3,Good Software as long as you don't upgrade your computer,"The idea behind this software is pretty good, but don't plan on using it if you have Windows 2000. It's sad that companies like this haven't upgraded their code to run on operating systems that have been out for more than two years.It is slightly buggy, so expect that, especially with the MDI cables, and the 'scoring' they perform on your performances."
2,Video Tutorials and Windows Codec warning.,There is one caveat that you should be fair warned about before buying Voyetra's Teach Me Piano. I went through Voyetra's portal to purchase the software and it is stated that they do support Windows XP. For the most part this will not work out of the box on Windows XP SP2 and there are NO plans for Vista support. The software requires Microsoft RLE Codec which was removed from Microsoft's distributions. The other required codec is the Intel Indeo Codec. Voyetra's tech support responds quickly to your requests but when it comes down to it they suggest reinstalling your OS and trying again. After reinstalling XP SP2 and the additional codec the application still did not work for me. This only impacts the video tutorials all of the other tutorials work great and the lesson plans are well designed and appear to be easy to follow.
1,Terrible usability,"Warning: This program must(!) be run from the CD drive. The installation process does not allow you to intall it to your hard drive even of you have plenty of disk space (most computers do these days).I suppoose Voyetra does this to discourage software piracy (as if you couldn't just burn a copy of the CD). However, you the buyer will pay the price.Running the program from the CD drive is slow and noisy and will be a distraction to your keyboard lessons.I suggest you stay away from this program until Voyetra stops teating their buyers like potential criminals.Askold wawryszyn"
3,Mediocre,"THis was a decent product and really covered all the basics, but as a experienced piano player I didnt really find anything special here and was kind of dissapointed. I can recommend this for a beginner though.PianManOwner of[..]"
1,Worst software EVER,"I was taking lessons from the internet FREE and decided to get Teach Me Piano with a gift certificate. This is without a doubt the worst software EVER. I installed and uninstalled it 3x. After muddling through the lack of any START instructions, I could play (I think) the beginning of the course until I exited and try to return later. Each time the software was ""performing an illegal operation and will close"" So unless you can spend the next year or so of your life while the software is working to learn the piano, forget it, you'll never get back in. I emailed the company 2x and have yet to get a response. So much for technical support. I have returned the junk for a refund. Thanks to..great return policies. I'll go back to FREE internet instructions."
4,Beautiful song collection,"I've been a Kealii-fan for many years even though his recent publications are nothing to rave about,but this collection has pretty much the best of the best he has to offer - and for anybody who likes to get lured by those sweet Hawaiian tunes or sense the true power of Hula in those rhythmic Hawaiian chants this is a great album to add to your collection! I certainly didn't regret it!"
2,Nice begining but..,"I loved the character Christian, but I wanted to strangle Maddy by the middle of the book. She was so creepy to Christian and just downright stupid and annoying. How could anyone be such a jerk even back then. She ruined the whole book for me."
1,Not what I expected,"I've heard 'wonders' about this book, but I was not impressed. Aside from the fact that it was different because of the hero's seizure I did not find him dangerous, witty, or special And she was just so WIMPY and I was so sick and tired of Quaker this and Quaker that.I was frustrated at how being a Quaker (in those days, I'm sure) put so many limitations on her actions and her feelings. And the details were so intricate I was skimming over pages. Not sure I'll be reading Kinsale again!"
1,ugh,"i dont know what all the hype is about this book. It was horrible. The female character was....unloving...despite the efforts of the author to get you to feel for her and understand her dilemas while dealing with her religion and duty. She was unchristian in my mind. I absolutely could not stand her. As for him, I did like the way the author described what was going through his mind while attempting to communicate. It was very human, and so was he. The only reason I gave it a 1 was because of him and his plight. Is a throw away. sorry author, but you failed miserably with this one."
2,"Wanted to like it, but just couldn't stand it","Why? Why did one of my all-time favorite authors have to reissue this book? It was downright awful. From one of the most priggish and uninspiring heroines in history to one of the most frustrating and (yes) abusive heroes in memory, I kept wondering why I turned page after page to finally arrive at the much-appreciated ending. Yes, I understand that Maddy had to come to grips with leaving her religion behind, and yes, I get that Christian was angry, but still, their story held and delivered about as much interest as watching paint dry. As the Italians say, ""There is no worse thief than a bad book."" I agree whole-heartedly. I also just finished Lessons in French, and I am amazed that someone didn't tell Ms. Kinsale to chop a good 100 pages off of either of these novels, in the name of common sense. Gah. It's such a let-down after the wonderful Shadow and the Star. Let's hope her future works are better!!!!"
3,"eh, so-so, 3-stars for situation, 2-stars for romance","The heroine was a pious, cowardly woman I did not find likeable. Our hero has an affliction we never gain any insight into which I found extremely frustrating as all heck. The plot kept me reading, Papa Timms was a character I enjoyed, and the dogs were wonderful. However I felt the heroine was wrapped up in her own piety and the Duke just desperate and in love with the only ray of hope he had in the world, this Quaker woman. I did not find the love story itself very compelling. But the mathematics was intriguing, and the hope of finding the Duke's cure held my interest. In the ending, I was just left abruptly like, ""oh she changes her mind again""."
3,It was okay....,"This book was just okay for me. The story was more interesting than the romance, (At least in the beginning and the middle). It dragged on in the end. The hero was okay, but I couldn't stand the heroine. It seemed like she never had the hero's back. He had to basically kidnap, threaten, plot and scheme for her to actually help him ,and she was always miserable doing it. LK could definitely tell a story and I will absolutely read her again, but I think this book is a tad bit over rated."
5,A unique experience,"This novel makes me believe in the power of love.At the end of the day, to me, that's the mark of a great Romance story."
5,Loved It,"I know I've read a great book when I can't help but tell someone the story. It was for lack of a better word beautiful. Our hero, the Duke of Jervaulx, Christian, has a stroke he is frustrated to find he can't move or talk so he does what any person would do. He lashes out. The problem is now his family think he's insane and put him in an asylum. How can he prove them wrong? With the help of Maddy he's recovering but also losing his heart to her at the same time. He needs Maddy's help to recover fast enough to convince everyone he's sane and stop his family from taking his fortune.Please read this book it's wonderful. I was intrigued, because I found a lot of people listing it as their best romance. Now I understand why. It truly is worth reading and rereading."
1,Why the rave reviews?,"I was excited to pick up this book, especially after reading so many great reviews. But honestly....what in the world have I missed? For as long as this book was, I didn't really care for H/H one way or another. There was more script devoted to describing things then allowing us to get to know the characters. I found myself skipping over the excessive descriptions more than once. I found the heroine, Maddy, more annoying then anything else. She was very inconsistent and I felt bad that Christian was ""stuck"" with her. She was great in the beginning of the book, but just annoying as things progressed. Nothing but hope for major recovery kept me tuned into this book. I really did make it through only hoping that the next page will offer a break through in the story, but nope... This book was a struggle to read."
2,Horribly Dissapointing,This book was on the top of my wishlist forever and when I bought it I was sooo excited. After the first 120 pages or so I was so bored I didn't want to keep reading the book.It dragged on and on with tedious details and the main male character at first pulled at my heart strings. But then you just realize he is selfish. And when they declair their love it seams so stupid. She cares more about religion then him and he is just a selfish man who wants someone to take care of him.Very dissapointing.
1,Bored to Tears,"A great portion of this book is Maddy as a Quaker nurse caring for Christian who is a Duke. Christian has had a stroke and has been confined to an insane asylum. There are sweet and emotional interactions here but their time together in the asylum went on and on and on and on. We get the point. Maddy is Christian's ""rock"" and he comes to depend on her. Christian helps bring Maddy out of her confined Quaker world and she feels romantic love for a man. These two are codependent on one another for pages and pages and pages...... Soooo boring.It is also not terribly romantic watching a young , handsome man attempt to recover from a stroke. It made me wonder about the depth of illness in the Duke. It is not that common for a very young man to have a stroke without having some underlying vascular or cardiac disease. Not exactly what good romance stories are made of."
4,characters with depth,"I am new to this author. I've read Flowers from the Storm and The Star and the Shadow. I enjoyed both. I enjoyed Flowers from the Storm more. I understood the uniqueness of the writing, especially whenever Christian got mad at Maddy, he's make up some name for her that related to the current crisis. Thought that was very creative. Don't know if I'll read her other books. Some of the reviews seem to make them less worthy than these two."
5,Flowers from the Storm,"One of the best historical romance novels I have read. Laura Kinsale offers exceptional character development, story development, and prose."
2,Insipid heroine,I must agree with some of the previous reviewers. The heroine made me want to throw the book across the room. I honestly did not understand the buzz about this book. It was just OK.
5,10 stars!!,"ive never read a romance novel 2x, but this one!! The main characters, Maddy & Christian, WOW!, didnt want the story to end, loved it!! The story plot was unique indeed, wasnt expecting it, how the love evolves betwn them, just AWeeee, so endearing."
5,Loved it!,I loved the story almost as much as the historic details! This is the best historical romance novel I have read. (Unless you count Outlander in the same category.)
2,Mixed Feelings,"This book could have been a great story and had the potential to be a real keeper to read over and over again. The premise was fantastic. However, the book just dragged on and on. The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the ""love conquers all"" typical ending."
3,Want to say Great but can't,I ordered this book because the reviews suggested that this was a great novel. It was in its own way but something was missing for me.It is most certainly a dark and dramatic novel and is beautifully written.
5,Outstanding,"Amazing. This isn't what I expected. The characters had depth and personality. I felt their joys and pains. I emphasized with the confusion when one's hard held religious beliefs come in direct conflict with real life situations. Will one keep to one's moral and ethically code, ""to thine ownself be true"" , but at whose expense? This is the first romance novel I have read where the main character is a stroke ""survivor"". I felt ever one of his hard earned accomplishments. It also provided me with a more indepth understanding into how a person's verbal skills are mixed up in their minds."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"I bought this shade and it has no support and constantly falls down out of the windshield. It was installed as per the directions, and always managed to fall from behind the visors that are flipped down to hold it in place. This was a nice item, just dosen't stay in place, I plan to return this item this week."
2,Works well when it stays in place,"Bought this shade for my wife and her 2007 Civic. The shade seems to be of high quality and keeps the sun off the dash (and the car cooler) when ... and I repeat WHEN it stays up. The shade reflects the sun well but is not sturdy enough to remain in-place (especially with the car's sun visor down). It simply wilts like a lettuce leaf and falls onto the dash.The truth be told the windscreen of the 2006+ Civic is very large, requiring a large sunshade but this shade will not retain it's shape after repeated uses. I would recommend other possible solutions ..."
4,FitsPerfect on My Civic Coupe 2006,Filled Perfectly the Crystal of My Civic Coupe 2006. It's a Little Complicated to Mount and Unmount Because Is Big.
2,expensive,Not quite cut to fit. It is a tad long both ways and very hard to roll up while setting in the front seat. Best to stand outside to roll up. Otherwise a good product and expensive for what you get.
4,"Works great, Hard to store","It fits very well. you do not need to pull down the visors. But, it is so big and I just throw it in the back seat. Well, civic has a big windshield and this is the only product that works!"
4,"Fits the window, not the back seat","Item is slightly wider than the windshield and a perfect fit in height for my 2010 LX coupe. It WILL stay up on its own without folding down the visors, however it doesn't fold up for storage, it rolls up, so expect a wrestling match that will leave it taking up your entire back seat when you're in a hurry. The Civic has a huge windshield that won't fit an off the shelf sunshade, so this is your best bet."
1,What a waste of money.,"I enjoy reading Michael Grant's books - in fact, he is one of my favourite authors. In most of his books, he makes history an enjoyable romp, writing books that are engaging and hard to put down.However, this book is one of the biggest rip-offs I've seen. It has a price from Fantasyland and the text is about as detailed as the leaflets you pick up from a museum. For example, the 'Chapter' on Pagan Temple architecture has a total of 488 words. It has over 100 pages only because there are full-page title-pages introducing each section.Considering this is supposed to be a book on Roman Art, the text tells you nothing, and the price is so high you think you are getting something of quality, rather than a hardcover museum leaflet. Michael Grant should stick to books on historical figures, (Eg. Nero, Cleopatra etc) and leave Art History to the experts."
5,A 2008 ALSC Notable Children's Video Selection!,"Pulled in two directions, Izzy Daniels must find a balance between his passion for boxing and his promise to help his friends with an intense double-Dutch jump-roping competition. Live-action, Jump In! combines themes of friendship, hard work, and individuality with energizing hip-hop music and impeccable choreography. This DVD was selected by the ALA's Association for Library Service to Children as a 2008 Notable Children's Video, and it is the winner of the prestigious Andrew Carnegie Medal, awarded by ALA for excellence in the field!"
4,Jump in Review,"I give the movie Jump In 4 stars, because it was good. It showed lots of examples of internal and external conflicts. I think that this movie is good for children and families to watch just for fun. This movie was about a boxer whose friend jumped rope, and asked him to join, he didn't know, because he wanted to do both. Watch the movie to see what happens!"
4,Fast Food for the Soul,"This DVD was a gift for my wife, who is one of the ""Jump In"" fans in this house. I don't have quite the enthusiasm for this movie that they do, which leads me to believe that it is something of a ""chick flick.""A tight plot, engaging characters, and quick pace put this show several notches above ""viewable.""I enjoyed the story of a boy learning how to deal with conflicting demands and responsibilities.The jump-rope contest choreography is impressive, and helps make this DVD a good buy, although sports purists might question the fusion of jump-rope tricks and boxing in another scene.Disney Studios seems to be re-discovering the bourgeois inhibitions that made it a global success, so those who require relevance, naughty words, and people with the self-control of an ADHD tomcat in their entertainment will be sorely disappointed in ""Jump In."" Aside from these deficiencies, this is a highly entertaining musical."
5,Jump In: Excellent Family Movie!!,"Disney did a fantastic job creating this uplifting/upbeat movie. The message to kids is awesome -- a girl can be a boxer, and a boy can Double-Dutch -- follow your heart and do what you enjoy despite what nay-sayers think. I'm 40, my daughter is 20 and my son is 8 -- this being an EXCELLENT movie may be the only thing we all agree on ... and we loved it so much we bought the CD soundtrack (I would HIGHLY recommend the soundtrack). Very positive hip-hop/rap -- if more kids listened to these tunes, the world would be a happier/safer more encouraging place!!5 Stars is not high enough of a rating!! If you only buy one movie this year, buy this one! Send a positive message back to Disney that this is what kids need to hear, see, do."
3,A cake that's sparkling with colors,"'Cake' by The Trash Can Sinatras falls somewhere in between The Sundays' dreamy guitar textures and the playful romps of The Housemartins. Throw in Johnny Marr's fluid jangles and minstrel-like vocals of Roddy Frame, and you have a debut combines melodic/acoustic-derived Britpop with The Smiths. Joyous and sparkling. Not a bad combination. Let The Trash Can Sinatras take you on a leisurely stroll where the sun is shining, the grass is green, and everything is alright."
5,Fresh Cake hits the spot,"Despite their name, The Trash Can Sinatras sound about as fresh as you can get. Their debut album shows off John Douglas's and Paul Livingstone's lush and intricate guitars. Singer Frank Read, and his lyrics, provide a worthy voice to it all.Their first single, ""Obscurity Knocks"", is probably the best example of their bright and breezy sound. While the delicate guitars are further highlighted in ""Even The Odd"", ""The Best Man's Fall"" and ""Only Tongue Can Tell"", the quintet gives percussion a good airing in the stomping ""Circling The Circumference"".This album should be listened to at home with all the windows and doors thrown open.The Trash Can Sinatras got their name after playing for beer at discos where they sang Frank Sinatra covers."
5,"Clever, great melodies. This is pop music at its finest.","This is an album filled with thoughtful and catchy tunes. Play ""The Best Man's Fall"" and your attention'll do. I want you to know that I like your poems, but I hate your poetry. So buy this album and it'll make you feel you were born again, yet it's ashame you never grew up."
3,the roots,"elvis meets the proclaimers, right? not that it doesn't work, but it HAS been done before, you know. Does anyone here know who Nick Lowe is?"
1,This is NOT Cake!!,"I purchased this CD, thinking I had stumbled upon something by the group Cake that I didn't already own.I was EXTREMELY disappointed -- this is NOT by the band ""Cake""! It is by the band ""Trashcan Sinatras"", and, well, it's going into the trashcan. It is intolerably wimpy -- nothing like the rockin', quirky, well-enunciated, creativity of the band Cake!"
5,Comodynes Self-Tanning Towelettes,I want to purchase five sets of these goods.Comodynes Self-Tanning Towelettes
4,Good self-tanner,"This product is easy to use and gives a nice even tan, just remember to wash your hands thouroughly afterwards"
4,Comodynes: Self Tan Towelettes,"Comodynes really does work, It worked in 2-3 hours, and I had a great looking tan, and some advice wear like a plastic glove when you put it on, or else your hand will turn all brown, I think this product is very good, other then that there's nothing bad about it, just it kinda smells. I recommend you get it."
2,Tan Towels,"This looked so good on T.V.that I ordered these single use tan towels.While the resultant color was good, it took more than one towel to cover the whole body. Additionally, the towels roll up as you use them so several times during the application you have to stop and unroll it before you can continue. It is easier than the self-tanning creams but not the fantastic product I anticipated. Thank you."
1,Not a fan!,"Hate this product! Don't waste your time or money!Left me streaky, orange, and it smelt awful! I wouldn't waste my money again on this!"
2,Orange palms and to many applications,It actually took 4 applications and still did not get that much of a tan. When they advertised this product on tv they said it will not stain your palms. That is a lie. Plus it leaves streaks and some spots orange looking. This product is not at all as South Beach had advertised. I do not think I will use it again. Very un-happy with the results and the number of towletts I had to use just to acheive a light tan.
1,Doesn't do the job,"I just purchased these towlettes based on multiple positive reviews. I had used L'Oreal's towlettes before and liked them, but everyone seemed to think these Comodynes were better. THEY ARE NOT. They don't smell bad, are easy to use, BUT they don't make you tanner! I have a dance competition coming up and now have to run out and try to find the L'Oreal product locally. Bottom line? Don't waste your money. Use L'Oreal's towlettes instead.L'Oreal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Towelettes . - Medium Natural Tan"
3,NOTHING SPECIAL,"HOnestly, this product isn't any better, than, let's say, ""Loreal Sublime"" tanning wipes, and it cost a lot more. Don't waste your money being fooled into purchasing it because it's from Europe, or whatever. It's no better than anything else that we sell here in the states."
5,CURRENT REVIEW FOR 2000,IT IS GREAT TO SEE THAT OUR SOCIETY IS COMING TOGETURE IN REGARDS TO RESPONDING TO DURING AND RECOVERY OF AN EMERGENCY BY USING ICS. THE FOG THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT IS A LITTLE OUT OF DATE. THE NEW VERSION ICS 420-1 DATED OCT 94 COVERES MORE IN THE AREAS AS FOLLOWS: 1.MACS 2.US&R 3.Multi Casualty 4.Organizational Guides 5.Hazardous Materials 6.Resource typing and Minimum Standards 7.CommunicationsThis Field book was published by Fire Scope of California. What my organization has done was added to the Incident Command System to fit our organizational needs and still be able to communicate on the same page with our counter parts at the civil level.
5,A consumate singer/songwriter,"Cheryl Wheeler may be one of the best, if not the best, singer/songwriters traveling the country right now. Driving Home is her most compelling album, due to the wonderful melodies and reflective lyrics that one finds in such classics as Driving Home, Seventy-five Septembers, Orbiting Jupiter, and the heartbreaking Almost. It also contains her wry wit, as with ""Don't forget the guns"". If you can't get to a live concert, this album is a must."
4,A pleasant experience,"While I do enjoy listening to many songs on this CD--it is not my favorite collection of Cheryl's material by any means. I love the title song, ""Driving Home"" as well as ""Silver Lining,"" ""Frequently Wrong.....,"" ""75 Septembers"" and ""When Fall Comes to New England."" But I do have problems with ""Orbiting Jupiter"" and ""Almost."" But it is still very much worth listening to and owning."
5,An inspired book,"Sadly, too few people are aware of Dee Hock. What he accomplished at Visa was revolutionary, and his insights on organizations and management are nothing short of genius. He ought to be part of the curriculum in every business school, and required reading for each CEO. While there are a few ideas in this book that I don't wholeheartedly agree with, for the most part he's very, very right."
5,Dee has allowed his life to speak...,"In this wonderful volume, Dee Hock chronicles his lifelong struggle to understand the very nature of organization, information and the role of wisdom. Dee believes deeply that we must learn how to allow organizations to exist on the knife-edge between order and chaos -- chaordic organizations. Dee's passion goes far beyond a desire to see continuous improvement. He tells why he believes this new worldview is necessary to avoid global institutional failure.I believe in another 100 years Dee Hock's name will still be on the lips of innovators as one who pointed the way when we found ourselves increasingly lost. I love this book...and believe it is very, very important."
5,Corporate America's loss is our grandchildren's gain.,"Dee Hock retired as CEO of VISA in his mid-50's to ""open his life to new possibilities"". After a decade of contemplation he returned to public life to ""attempt to catalyze the institutional change that a liveable future demands"". This book details the fascinating life story of an honest man with a brilliant vision of the world our grandchildren deserve to live in. Buy it for yourself, your children, your grandchildren and their children. And don't just read it, LIVE IT!"
5,A 21st century Hero,"Simply put, Dee Hock is a man of conviction and courage. In establishing an organization structure that is far from most business hierarchies, he has given us a method to emulate for today's rapidly changing business model.As an information technology team coach, I found Dee's examples of having a well defined purpose as the center in promoting creativity and productivity right on target. His MiniMaxims are a throwback to the humor and insight of Will Rogers.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in an alternative to common business structure."
3,Commendable Sentiments Bombastically Expressed,"Of the three U.S. releases by Hothouse Flowers, this fledgling effort ranks in the middle. The performances and sonics are fine and the songwriting is of a consistently strong calibre. Unfortunately, the incredible energy this band manifests in its live shows comes across on record as bombast. That tendency was better moderated on the subsequent ""Home"" and perhaps excessively so on ""Songs from the Rain."" There are fine momemts on this record nevertheless and the fine sentiments expressed deserve plaudits. Fans of all things Irish may add one star."
4,A good find.,"I don't know a single other person who has ever even heard of ""Hothouse Flowers"", but I'm glad that I know them. I wouldn't call this a must-have, however it's still really good. Being from Ireland, they do remind me some of ""The Waterboys"", though not as traditional, and some of 1980's ""U2"", but less rock. Many of their songs do have a passionate, and anthem-type feel. I haven't heard much else from them, but I suspect this is their best release. Overall a great album, and perfect for the person who likes their music with a Guinness."
3,Trainer worth the money but shipping a big headache.,The Ellipitcal Trainer FINALLY arrived on 1/2/08. It was to be a Xmas gift and shipped on 12/12/07. Contacted Amazon and was given credit when it still did not show up by 12/28/07. Made several phone calls to shipper with no results. Received no type of compensation from Amazon for all the phone calls made trying to find out where item was. As stated it did show up on 1/2/08 and we are satisfied with Trainer. I just ordered a Grizzly Table Saw which I could have gone through Amazon to buy but after problem with shipping I went directly to Grizzly to buy saw.
5,Steinberg,Steinberg's book is intriguing. He is much more knowledgable about Catholic theology and hagiography than most Catholics. The many samples of the art work referred to in his book give ample support to his thesis.Be sure to get the second edition which includes responses to the critiques of the first edition.This book is really amazing.
2,not a toy!,I ordered this thinking that it would be cute for my two year old. Not cute at all! this was so small my son could not play with this.
3,The littlest wagon,"We purchased this wagon for our 1 yr old to pull around small toys. Unfortunately, the wagon pull is too short to pull even for a 12 month old without hunching over. It is cute but definitely a better use for display than an actual toy."
3,It REALLY is quite small,"The description of the wagon ""Little Red Wagaon"" says it all. It really is a little wagon. Too small for our 18 month old. The handle is too short. Its a nice little wagon, but just too small. I should have read the description more closely."
1,WAYYYYYYYY TOO SMALL DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!,"I was using this red wagon as a photography prop, I knew that it was small, but in person its literally small enough to fit in your hand! Only one VERY SMALL bear could fit in this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WASTE OF MY MONEY AND WAY OVER PRICED!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Decorative Item - Not a Toy,"Just to be clear - this item is way too small to be a toy. I read this in the reviews and ordered it anyways, thinking it would be fine for my toddler to play with, since he doesn't really like to fill it, he just wants something to pull. The handle is too short for him to reach to pull, not to mention is too small to put much in. We sent it back and ordered the little tikes wagon, which is perfect."
5,Super cute and just the right size.,"I originally ordered this small wagon to use as decoration for my son's radio flyer 1st birthday party. After the party, my son and daughter have LOVED playing with it. It is just the right size for them to put a few small toys in it and pull them around. It is very sturdy. My son actually stood in it and there has not been any damage to it. The only problem I have had with it is that I only got one! May have to order another one in the near future! We love it!"
2,Smaller Than You Think,"I admit that the dimensions are provided in the product desription, but this item is MUCH smaller than anticipated. My son is 2.5 and this wagon is WAY too small for him to pull comfortably. I gave it to my mother to use ornamentally on her lawn - that's all it's good for."
2,Small Wagon,"This is good for a toy only, very small and the handle is short. I was hoping my two and a half year old grand daughter could use it as a wagon to pull her dolls in but the handle was too short even for her. It is sturdy but not good for use as something for the kids to easily tow things in"
4,A fun little wagon for a fun little person,"Our 20-month-old has beat this wagon up - and it keeps going! It's just the right size for her to pull around the driveway and the yard - being filled with all sorts of stuff.I did take a little while to assemble, with tools... so don't let the little ones see the box until it's together."
3,radio flyer littlt red wagon,bought this for grandson. I did not realise it was so small. I was very disappointed. He enjoys it though.
5,Small and very cute.,I had a sock monkey and red wagon theme for my son's birthday. I ordered this little wagon to use as decoration. I ended up putting all the hamburger and hot dog condiments in it and it was a great hit at the party. Now my son pulls it around and takes his various toys for a ride.
2,for my grandson,much smaller than I thought it was going to be. My grandson really liked it but can't put much in it.
3,Not very durable,"This is a cute little red wagon. My 2 year old likes to put stuff in it and drag it around. However not very durable , the handle came off the next day. We got it back on bt I expected it to be a little more sturdy. It is much smaller than I expected . I knew it was a smaller version bt not this tiny"
4,It is indeed little,"You'd think between the description ""Little,"" and the photo of a tiny teddy bear, and a tiny child, I would have realized that it is not a full-sized red wagon. I have no excuse. Now that you've read this, you REALLY have no excuse.Otherwise it's fine."
2,Cute but cheap,"This is supposed to be a fully functional wagon, but once I had the thing assembled, the wheels would barely turn. I bought it for my niece hoping she could use it to pull her toys around in it, but it seems likely to fall apart with normal play. Be warned. It might make an adorable novelty, not a toy for a child. Made in China, just like everything else these days."
2,Very short handle,"I bought this as a gift for my almost 18 month old nephew for Christmas. The handle was so short that when he tried to pull it even with his arm down all the way, the front wheels came off the ground. I was very disappointed. My son had a Radio Flyer wagon like this when he was almost 2 and the handle was different and longer."
2,Too small,"I guess I should have read the product description more carefully. I was looking for a wagon that my daughter could carry her toys in, but instead, it's not big enough to carry much of anything. I will be returning this and looking for something bigger."
1,Dangerous for kids!,"I don't know if the one I got was defective, but this product should have never gotten past whatever agency rates toys for this age group. The bolt that connects the handle mechanism to the wagon frame does not lock, so whenever you turn the handle you slowly unscrew the bolt! You can't have an 18 month old playing with a tiny little bolt that fell off. Terrible, absolutely terrible and this should be pulled off the market."
1,More Decorative Than Functional,"This little wagon is adorable but that's about it! It's teeny tiny. The handle is so short that my 1 1/2 year old cannot pull it without stooping a bit. It often turns over on its side when changing directions. In my opinion, this wagon is better for looking at than playing with. It would look really cute in a boys room on top of a dresser with a stuffed animal in it."
4,Cute and works just like a real wagon,"We have the ATW Radio Flyer wagon that my 2 y.o loves to ride on and because of this, she would pull at anything she would see with a string, rope, ribbon or belt and pretend that she was pulling a wagon. So I decided to buy her this little red wagon so that she could have a real one to pull with. She would put all sorts of toys in it. The handle is not that long and a 3 yo or older would probably have a difficult time pulling this wagon. This wagon could also be a nice decorative ornament/accessory for a kids playroom."
4,Wagon,"I bought this wagon for my 1 1/2 year old daughter so she could tote around her toy hippo--she initially tried to sit herself in it, but she got upset when she couldn't fit :) It is very cute and a perfect toy for her."
4,Cute!,"Love this little wagon. It can be used as a cute photo prop. Play toy for your child. Gave it a 4 instead of a five, because when we were putting the wheels together the red plastic covers that go over the metal rod were really tight and the metal popped thru the platic runining the red covers. It still functions well, just looks silly to be brand new."
3,Smaller then I thought,Very cute! But a bit small for what I bought it for (newborn shoots). Also the handle and wheels are made out of plastic instead of metal which is still sturdy but I would have preferred metal.
3,Better as a gift basket,"I got this for my 2 year old hoping she could easily pull it around the house and yard. The wheels are not really made to roll, and the handle is very short for her. It causes her more frustration than fun. Wish I had just gotten a real wagon. I'll keep it, but most likely will use it as a gift basket."
2,Not a toy,I ordered for my nephew who is under two thinking he could put toys in it and pull them around in the wagon. But when I got the wagon I realized it is a item that would work for a basket or to decorate the yard if there were no neighbor kids around. It is not a toy. I am dissappointed as I was looking at the Radio flyer name since my son had a radio flyer when he was a kid maybe it would be a fun toy. It is not a toy even though it comes up under that heading. It belongs in home and garden. I am returning this one to Amazon.
2,Ohhh This One Went Bad,"Sometimes an artist gets tied up with a label that doesn't know what it's doing and tries to string together ""stars."" This is the 2nd collaboration that has gone awry in the Cecil annals. The first was a duet with Max Roach. Sadly, it was recorded too early into the tour and before Max, maybe the best drummer Cecil ever played with, had mastered CT's music. Momentum has the similar problems. Early into the recording you three guys lost. Dewey blowing something silly without much rhyme or reason. Elvin on a different path. CT gives in and just mocks the affair with a bunch of silly chords. Eventually, the music gets better, then worse. Momentum just should have never been released without a little more rehearsel, but that cost money so screw the art. The powers that be toss it out on a public that can be satisfied with nothing but a buncha notes in a mall anyway. Despite all the problems, it was probably a good seller, but obviously not enough to keep in print."
5,Good Stuff -That's all I wanted to say.,"Good stuff. Don't have anything deep and meaningful to add, but I liked this book and wanted to say so. It pulls you in slowly, so that you might think it's going to be one sort of book and next thing you know you're off on wild ride across the West. Literary and exciting; a western and yet subversive of the genre at the same time. And I thought the twist toward the end was great. Didn't really see it coming, but once sprung it all made sense."
4,"Wonderfully descriptive, but annoying style","Durham evokes the wildness of the Plains and West with superb prose, sometimes nearly poetry in its details. Gabriel is a realistic depiction of an impatient, uncertain teenager. The plot line certainly keeps the reader involved, as we are curious to learn what new horror Marshall and Caleb will unleash on the people around them, as well as whether Gabriel and James will escape. But Durham's decision to present certain portions in italic with no names given to the people in them--even after we have been introduced to those people--struck me as striving too much for some mystical effect. I'm not clear on what this style is supposed to achieve and found it more annoying than effective."
4,Good find for Rotation Workshop,"I write curriculum for my church's Rotation Workshop and was choosing a video for the parable of the lost sheep and lost coin. This video gives a very direct telling of what salvation is all about. It also has a re-enactment of the two parables. Although I thought it might be too wacky, it was a hit with my 3rd and 5th graders, and they are the audience! My 5th grader loves Frank Peretti's books, so he enjoyed seeing him play Mr. Henry."
2,A disappointment . . .,"As a collector of the entire series, no one awaited this book more than I. I feel let down. Of the 13 stories, (and it's only 318 pages, not 352), seven are fiction. These were not well chosen: selections from Treasure Island and Moby Dick are not even set at sea, but are the land-based openings of the books. The non-fiction does not live up to the billing of the editorial reviews that preceded it on this page. There is not much shipwreck or survivial: several are more like philosophical essays as opposed to stories with an edge. The story on diving the Andrea Doria is perhaps the best in the book, but many of us will have seen it elsewhere, as it is recent. Why a fictional account of the Titanic and not a true one? For a book on treasure, why nothing of Mel Fisher and the Atocha? If you want sea adventure, the earlier book in the series, Rough Water, delivers a bigger punch. This volume, regratably, is one that you can put down between stories."
2,"More adrenaline, please","As a passive individual, I live through the words and experiences of first hand authors for my adventure. This narrative simply scratches the surface of those before it. ""Ship of Gold"", ""The Fatal North"" and ""Abandon Ship!"" come to mind immediately as adrenaline rush examples. Any of the several publications on ""The Endurance"" far exceed the expectations of ""Deep Blue"". The human spirit has greater tales to tell."
2,Didn't do it for me,After hearing the debut album from Fischer's latest project Triptkon I thought wow I have to check out that Apollyon Sun side project and see what that was all about. I was psyched to find it for a mere two bits brand new from one of Amazon's Marketplace Sellers. I must admit I am glad that is all I paid for it. It just sounds like a poor White Zombie album to me. I think that Celtic Frost (especially the last line up) was top notch and Triptykon has a great future I believe. I know that this was a side project of Tom's and he admitted it was different from his normal style. I gave this one the 40 minute elliptical trainer test on my ITouch at the gym and it didn't keep me pumped although I still finished! I know some reviewers mentioned NIN and other bands that I have heard that this does sound more like and I realized I don't like those bands so I guess it's no surprise I didn't like this one either.
1,Apollyon Sun's Sub is not worth listening to,"This album has a sheer lack of good taste that haunts Thomas Fischer (a.k.a. Satanic Slaughter, Th. Fischer, Tom Warrior, Thomas Gabriel) since Into the Pandemonium, regarded as avant garde but, in my opinion, just out-of-topic-metal.It isn't metal, it isn't industrial, it isn't pop. It is just bad music in all senses. Messiah should not be cited in such a way. What is the necessity of something called R U Morbid, with some ""Uh""'s? The album (and the band) has a severe lack of concept.The listener remains with a strange feeling (in a bad sense). If Thomas doesn't want to be remembered for his earliest work, then why all the citations? Listen and get irritated."
4,Eclectic by which group? Celtic Frost or Big Country,"The reviews for Eclectic (Big Country artist) seem to center around a release from ""Celtic Frost"". Please Amazon sort this out."
5,Excellent,My son loves loves loves this movie !! Now if they would only come out with a shark boy costume that would be awesome !!!! MY SON CHANGED HIS NAME TO SHARK BOY LOL LOLNICE doing buisness with ya ! thanks
5,i thought it was a DVD???,"Maybe i should have paid a little closer attention to the detail, but there were several ""adventures of sharkboy and lavagirl"" products. i thought it was a DVD...i dont really know what UMD for PSP is but it was way too small for my dvd player lol. anyways it was my mistake, but my 5 year old daughter gives sharkboy and lavagirl 2 thumbs up. It arrived within a week, good price."
4,terrific boy flick,"My 7 year old loved this movie. He and his friend got a kick out of the enclosed 3D glasses, and he watched the movie over and over again. I kept checking in with him, but he didn't find the film overly scary, as he has with other movies."
1,The worst movie I've seen in years,"I love to take my neice to children's movies, and usually find myself enjoying them as much or more than she does. Not so this one. The adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl had to be one of the most ill-conceived, poorly developed projects to ever make it through Hollywood. Riding on his success with the Spy Kids movies (which were so superior to this it isn't funny), Rodriguez must have found himself in a position where he didn't need to get script approval from anyone. It shows. If an unknown scriptwriter had tried to present this to a studio she or he would have been laughed right out of town. Unfortunately, Rodriguez managed to bypass all the checks and balances that veto bad stories and pushed this project through. I sat through the entire movie, as painful as it was, with my neice. Nearly a third of the audience walked out before it was over. They were the smart ones."
1,Hmm.. Another Stupid Comedy Behind The Mind of Spy Kids,"Yeah... since there's not much to say except it stinks... um.. here's a deleted scene.Kid: They're real!Teacher: No, they're fake!Kid: They're real!Teacher: No, they're fake!Kid: They're real![Some guy with a shark fin breaks through the window.)Guy With Fin: Sorry to wreck the scene, guys! But, this fin is in my skin! AGGHH!!!(Guy with fin dies.)Kid: See, they're real!Teacher: Aw, man. I lost my deal.By the way, that scene is better than the whole movie combined.LOCAL EVIL MONKEY"
5,My boys and nephews LOVE this video!,"My boys and nephews just couldn't get enough of this video. I finally purchased one for each household. I don't remember hearing much about this movie when it was out. However, Chances are if your kids are between the ages of 4 and 11, they will love it too. They liked the music so much, I bought the CD too!"
5,Fun all around,"Bought this for a picky child, who LOVED IT. Lots of fun for all to view as family. One doesnot need to use 3-D method, which gives me a headache. The 2-D version on DVD,was great."
2,not what I ordered,"On Nov 7, I ordered what I thought was a NEW DVD (3-D & 2D versions which should have come with 3-D glasses). On Nov 18 I got a USED LIKE NEW with the DVD's, but no glasses. So, I went back to Amazon site to order 3-D glasses, but since they would come from another company, I would not get them before Dec. 24 or later. My daughter and granddaughters are coming in Dec 14 to Dec 21. AND Amazon is the only online company that has no customer service phone number, chat, etc."
2,No Adventure,"Just like home made movie with a little bit 3 D here and there. The story is so weak, I wonder why they bother to made this."
3,Ok movie.....,"Just watched this with my kid and a freind of his....this one was ok..not the greatest in the least!! The story was really good, as far as the moral is concerned, but I have to agree with some of the viewers that have reviewed this before me....1. Acting is sub-par, even for those that have not had very much experience acting...George Lopez definately did not win me over with this one!!2. 3-D aspect was great...for about 10 minutes...the effects were not that great!! I too, looked over the glasses after a while, and my son took his off all together after a while. His freind kept his on for the most part.3. Although the moral was good...the story itself got kinda old.4. Where in the hell are Kristen Davis and Dave Arquette's agents when they need them...UGGH!!Overall, this was a typical kids movie, and I too would not recommend this one to anyone over 10, 12 tops!!3 stars!!"
3,Not as Expected!,"I was really excited to hear that another 3-D movie from the makers of Spy kids was being released. I started reading online reviews about the movie, and they were all bad. The reviews made me expect a complete waste of time movie. I still went to the cinema to see it... and was surprised. It wasn't bad at all! The 3-D was great and the plot wasn't too bad either! The acting was excellent but that wasn't too bad! i not once got bored and stayed glued to the screen throughout the movie. I really liked it! I can not wait for this movie to be released on DVD and I will be buying it the day it comes out. i love this movie and I am sure your kids will too!"
2,Wait while I find a container for my apathy...,"As other reviewers have no doubt noted, this movie is a modern-day reimagining of The Neverending Story. The primary difference that sets this movie apart is that the visual effects are much better (as you would expect given the time between the two), but the story limps.The characters were cardboard 2-dimensional caricatures and felt forced and contrived as did the dialogue. The worst was when Max finally began to realize his power and began mouthing platitudes that felt stilted and awkward, having no believability coming from the mouth of a boy that young.On the positive side, the CG was done fairly well, and for all the pain that I endure sitting through this turkey, my 5-year old son loves it. That makes since I suppose since this movie comes in strongly at the 5-year old maturity level.Parents, your young children will probably love this, but avoid the agony of having to sit through this tripe yourself if at all possible."
2,Not the best movie...,"I saw Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D awhile ago. The commercials made it seem pretty exciting, and the fact that it was in 3-D, also made it cool... but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It just wasn't interesting. They said the word ""dream"" over and over and soon they broke into a song at one point in the movie, which now gives me nightmares. Also, the movie sort of rambled on. I would not suggest this movie because I didn't really enjoy it, and it was actually very boring."
5,Shark Boy and Lava Girl 3D Beats Spy Kids 3D!,SHARKBOY AND LAVA GIRL ROX! IT IS THE BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR! U HAVE 2 GET THIS MOVIE! U WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED IF U GET THIS MOVIE! AT LEAST I WASN'T! THIS MOVIE WAS VERY 3D AND IT WAS WAY BETTER THAN SPY KIDS 3D!
5,This movie is awsome!!,I loved this movie when I saw it in theartes!! The 3-D affects are awsome!! I just got it on DVD today!! I f you don't see this movie then you are missing out on a great move!! I am 14 and I loved this movie!!
2,SUSHI CAN PACK A BETTER PUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Since this movie is lame Im going to tell you the whole thing. It begins with a kid named Max who wants nothing more than toys games cookies and most of all his two idiot rolemodels. This movies story is made origionaly up by the directors 4 year old nut-case of a son. everything on this movie is fake the characters are fake what idiot would call his sons actual name sharkboy how can a little boy grow gils and fins even the power rangers are better than this!!! go watch herbie instead it at least has more people watching it.
1,Possibly the WORST movie ever made!,"I have four kids and usually wouldn't make the time to write one of these reviews, but this movie stunk so bad I felt the need to warn people!!! I spent the first half of the film waiting for some sort of plot to develop,and then I spent the second half of the film wishing it would end. Sharkboy doesn't say much in the movie at all except to unexpectedly yell at lava girl from time to time although they're supposed to be working together. Lava girl is an airhead and without any strong caharacters, and no real plot the movie seems to go in circles and circles and then finally has mercy on all of us viewers and ends. The 3-d was a great idea but I left with the feeling that some producers wanted to make a 3-d film and didn't bother actually writing a storyline before the actors started the movie. Do not subject yourself to this movie under any circumstanes!!!!"
3,french is funny,"shark,sharkboy and lava girl is not for 2 year olds or for old fat lazy men i think it looks horible but funny . it will be in the dollar theature in a week..................."
1,Don't we have more respect for kids than this?,"This is the worst acting in a children's movie that I have EVER seen. Nothing matter with the basic idea of the fanciful plot, but everything about the movie, from special effects to horrible acting, makes it the worst of filmmaking EVER. Skip it."
2,"This movie is almost unwatchable, far inferior to the Spy Kids line","Took my kids to see this in the theater. The acting is horrible, the dialog is horrendous, the plotline is pretty much non-existent. I expected a lot more from Robert R. because I've enjoyed the Spy Kids movies alot, but I can't imagine how anyone liked this movie. Do yourself a favor, pick up the Spy Kids trilogy and skip over this, you'll tank me."
1,unbox turned to crap,I hate to say it but unbox has turned to crap! I still have not viewed this movie. It will not download. It goes to que? whatever it is then nothing. I have no problems downloading the free stuff from Amazon so I dont understand why the paid rentals dont work right.
1,THIS MOVIE STINKS LIKE A THOUSAND MENS BATH ROOMS,THIS MOVIE STINKS LIKE A THOUSAND DIRTTY DIPPERS IN 2 DIMMISONS.BECAUSE IT IS NO FUN TO WATCH A MOVIE THAT WAS MENT TO BE IN3-D THAT IS IN NOW IN 2 DIMMENSION. WITH OUT ANY FURTHER TO DO DO NOT BUY THIS STUPID WASTE OF MONEY OH YEH I WANTED TO GIVE THIS MOVIE NEGATIVE 1 THRILLION STARS OR NO STARS BUT I WOULDNT LET ME SO DONT BE FOOLED BY THE ONE STAR I PUT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OH YEH EMOES
1,Horrible Seller - Did not ship 3D version of movie.,"Before purchasing the supposed blu ray 3D version of this movie, I already owned the DVD version because my daughters loved it. I wanted to upgrade so that my daughters could enjoy this movie with the 3D TV. What was shipped to me was not the 3D blu ray. It was blu ray, but not 3D. There is a distinct difference and this seller refuses to acknowledge this fact. Not only was it not 3D, but the packaging had Spanish translations, and the blu ray itself did not even have a menu. Upon inserting the disc, it goes right into the movie. When the menu button is pressed, all that appears is an audio option. Not only did they not ship me the 3D, but they shipped me a completely bogus, pirated copy. Do not buy from this seller."
5,My son says thank you!,"This movie is exactly what my three year old wanted. It has imagination, Super Heroes, Bad Guys and lots of laughs! Plus this is the first time my son got to see ""3-D"" thanks to the second disk (3-D version)and set of four ""3-D"" glasses that were included.Moderation keeps me from letting him watch it repeatedly everyday because he constantly asks to. This DVD set is good clean fun for the family."
1,A VERY DUMB AND BORING MOVIE!!!!,"I knew going into the movie that it was going to suck, and when it was finally over I knew my intuition was correct. This movie was very boring, contrived, silly, and devoid of comprension. No one over 10 years old will like this movie. Parents shouldn't take their kids to this pathetic movie unless they think bad movies is a good way to punish their kids. It was so sloppy much like an artist who throws paint on a canvas without judgement and calls it "" art"". The 3-D glasses drowned out the colors and left the viewer with shadows of blue all over the place. This film was terrible. Anyone who gives this movie a 4 or 5 star rating is simply lying or they are the type of people who have no taste and in which case they shouldn't even be taken seriously. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money on this junk flop.."
1,Too bad one is as low as it goes......,"I'm just going to do this in a list form so I don't blurt out every swear word I know.1. Plot- If there was a plotline, it's invisable2. Acting- Terrible. Period.3. Dialouge- *runs to bathroom*4. Effects- Bad. Harvest Moon has better. And that's a gamecube game XDOverall- -(largest number on earthThis is defiently the worst movie on earth! I expected soemthing for this, being from the creater of spy kids, but I got a flop. Don't rent it unless....'1. You want to see how terrible it is2. Torture people!3. Your clueless on how to rate movies"
1,this movie made me cringed & twitch to the max,"bad acting bad storytelling bad everything i wish this movie was never made i strongly disliked this movie it seriously was a waste of time and money to make god this movie is terrible seriously terrible and i thought my movies were bad but this movie takes the cake and just ruins my childhood foreverSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars)Star Wars: Fool's Bargain (Novella)Heir to the Empire (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 1)Dark Force Rising (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Book 2)The Last Command (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 3)Specter of the Past (Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn #1)Vision of the Future (Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn, Book 2)Allegiance (Star Wars)Star Wars: Choices of OneOutbound Flight (Star Wars)"
1,greatest movie ever,when i 1st bought this movie i thought oh no another kid movie but bravo academy award caliber just kidding wtf is this thing even about
4,"I can't stand this movie, but my 3yo son LOVES it","The acting is cringe-inducing, but my 3yo requests to see ALL the time. So, on the basis of my son's frequent requests, I give it four stars. Your toddler(s) will probably love it, the adults will just have to suffer through."
1,"I love this movie, but connection was very bad",My son loves this movie. The reason I gave a low rating is that the movie kept stopping and we had to keep reloading it. Very frustrating.
3,Younger kids like it,"This is a cute movie. Kinda cheesy and seems low-budget, but fun for the kids. I have a 3 year old daughter and a 5 year old son, and ever since they've seen this movie, all they do is pretend they are Shark Boy and Lava Girl. They are into superheros, and this is a nice way for them to relate to superheros their own age."
4,Good movie for the kids,"This is not my favorite movie ever, but it is certainly one of my seven year old son's favorite. We saw this movie when it came out in the theaters, and have rented it a few times. I decided to purchase it for his PSP becasue it will be a good one for him to watch while traveling this summer.The story line is pretty straight forward, and the acting is nothing to write home about, but he seems to like to watch it over and over agian. So as far as a movie for the young ones goes it is pretty good."
4,dvd,thought it was a regular dvd.. delivered in excellent condition. bought as a gift but had to trade it for another at the store. Guess i didn't read the label closely. but would definitely buy from seller again.
3,"Kids loved it, parents cringed","I'm sure my kids would give this movie five stars, but my wife and I would give it one (or zero). Hence the three-star compromise. My 5 year-old son jumped out of his seat after the movie and shouted, ""We have to get this on DVD when it comes out!"" He is normally very reserved, and it is not common for him to have this reaction to a movie. The story is like a weak plot for a video game, but this probably works well for the kids. The effects were pretty good, though they couldn't resist over-doing the 3D aspect a few times (how many times do we need to see someone spit into the audience?).We will probably end up getting this movie for the kids. It's not a movie we all can enjoy like ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" or ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" but hey, it's ""for the kids"" after all."
3,Not impressed.,"I ordered this video for my 4-year old son, and about half way through the movie, he asked me to shut it off and hasn't watched it since. He begged me to buy the video because he'd seen it at a friend's house, but now he won't watch it on his own."
2,"Very pretty, but the story falls flat","I bought this movie for my 7 year-old daughter for Christmas after she talked about it for months. And since receiving it in her Christmas stocking 3 days ago, I have seen it over a dozen times. The truth is, it gets worse every time I see it. I have to say, the movie itself (especially Planet Drool) is very pretty. The 3-D doesn't work well at all and actually makes the movie less colorful. We discarded the glasses after the first 3 minutes of the first showing. The acting is terrible and there are huge plot gaps. Most of the movie doesn't even make sense, although I like the idea. Even though it has been constantly playing in my house for 3 days, I've never seen it all the way through because it does not hold my attention.Despite all of this, my daughter adores this movie and hasn't stopped talking about it. What can I say?"
3,My Review,"I'm a big Rodriguez fan and go see all his movies. I'm a little disappointed in some of his recent work. I'm 22 years old and this movie was kind of cheesy. Spy Kids was great fun, but I think it would be unfair if I tried to compare to two series.But here's my review of this movie. This movie is strickly for kids not a 22 year old fan of the director. For kids I believe there is a good message about creativity and dreams that is good for young kids to have. I wish I had a movie like this when I was 8 years old. I think kids will love it and have great fun with it."
1,too bad movies in one,There are some movies that appeal to both kid's and adults. This is not one of them.This movie manages to be both an awful kid's movie and one of the worst superhero movies ever made. Resembles a bad video game. yawn.
2,Needs Improvement,"This movie was not very good, in my opinon.Although it had a good message, the acting could use improving. Also, the word 'dream' was used about 190 times throughout the whole movie. I don't think that kids over 13 will enjoy this movie very much."
1,No Glases,"The product description very clearly states this product comes with four pair of the type of 3D glasses you need to view this movie (the red/blue kind). I figured they would package in four very cheap pair of cardboard glasses. There were no glasses at all.The movie is fun, but buy it from someone else. There are other, better, sellers here on Amazon."
1,PATHETIC!!!!!!,My cousin rented this movie and after a long time finally convinced me to see it. it was horrible never in my life have i been so disgusted with a movie. i felt like smashing the movie but the dudes at movie gallery would get mad and i don't wanna pay a fine...all in all this is a dumb movie with blah effects and a horrible plot. and no i'm not a 17 year old just making fun of this movie cuz it's kiddy i'm 13 and i'm being *#$%ing honest. this movie is pathetic.
1,Too scary for under 7 yr olds with nightmares,"As a Marriage and Family Therapist, I do NOT recommend this movie if your child is under 7 years of age. Developmentally, they are unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality and this movie really confuses the issue if you have a kid already struggling with nightmares/bad dreams. Probably an ok pick for a slighly older child.Also - you REALLY need the 3D glasses if you're going to watch the movie properly. We weren't able to play it in 2D mode and the picture quality is very poor without 3D glasses."
1,THIS MOVE SUCKS,"This is a stupid movie.First of all sharks can't talk, electricity can't talk,when you break through windows those kind of windows you die,ice suclupsures can't talk,etc.I'm not going to say anything else because it would take me an hour to finsh the things that don't make sense.Also Talor Lauther stinks too."
5,This guy is bugged out... but we love him,"My girlfriend bought me this and was surprised to find it not only a double disc but a wicked full-length cd but also a great dvd including live footage, music video, etc. Apparently this band plays live quite a bit but it'd be great to see this band touring and over here."
1,Bad idea,"I would never recomment that anyone purchase any replacement cartridges other than ORIGINAL LEXMARK CARTRIDGES. These cartridges didn't even last a month, and the print quality was horrible."
1,What a piece of junk!,I bought this recorder from Buy.com and it worked for about 60 days. Then the U99 code started and the unit became worthless. I wanted it replaced not repaired. Now it is in the repair shop for a couple of months. I will never buy Panasonic again. What a piece of junk!
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the first review of a product I have ever written but felt I needed to warn others. DON'T BUY THESE THINGS....THEY ARE JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My unit has to be unplugged at least once a week for a reset due to a lockup. It won't even eject the disk at times because it is locked up (especially since the automatic firmware upgrade was made). I have spoken to Panasonic about the issue and as others have stated, they know nothing about these problems. They suggested I hold down the channel up and down buttons simultaneously to perform resets. That doesn't work and why should I have to perform ""resets"" in the first place. I literally have to unplug this piece of junk and let it reset. If anyone out there is a lawyer who deals with class actions, I would be willing to sign up. Anyone else??????????If you want to buy a quality DVD recorder look to Pionner and not Panasonic."
3,Inoperable,"I could NOT get this device to record either to HDD or DVD-RAM after two calls to Panasonic. I had to send it back for a refund as Buy.com was out of stock. I am looking for another one though, and want to give it another chance. I did get the SD card slot to work, and was able to view digital pics from my camera. The TV guide function did work well. I like the bigger hard drive and the card input slots that this model has over the E85 model."
1,panasonic dvr,"I purchased one of the first panasonic dvr with the lifetime membership. When the HD went out and replaced, it was a expensive repair. The second one quit. My son replaced the HD and opening the unit found the HD encased with foam. Overheating????? yes! Programing soon became a problem. Panasonic support is terrible. I would never buy a panasonic product again.Had a comcast dvr, not a good product. Called Comcast regarding using TiVo with the cards that need to be installed and they said I had to upgrade my services. Called TIVO, you do not need to upgrade and they will do a 3way call with comcast when you set up your unit for the cards. MJS"
1,the panasonic dmr-e95h is useless,The panasonic dmr-e95h is useless.So is the tech support from Panasonic.I will NEVER buy ANY panasonic product again.Tech cannot supply answers.To any questions.At all.They are at best barely fuctioning dopes without the slightest interest in helping.This is after waiting 45 minutes.The firmware updates do not work.The item does not work as described.It has more bugs than a swamp in Floridia.It is more sensitive than a movie stars ego.There should be a website devoted to how useless all of these panasonic dvd recorders.What a waste of money WATCH OUT!!!!!
2,Chicken Soup For The Millionaire Author's Soul,"While the book is not bad, the authors will give you the irritating feeling that they have milked this cow for all it is worth. Where does it end? Chicken Soup for the Soup Lover's Soul? Chicken Soup for the Mountain Climbers Soul? Chicken Soup for the Amazon Reviewer's Soul???Where there is a buck to be made on inspiration, the authors of the ""Chicken Soup"" series will sniff it out."
5,Another gem from Ms. Shirley Horn...,"Every new album Shirley Horn releases seems to be better than the previous one...and this new one is certainly no exception.Despite losing her right foot to diabetes last year, and leaving her usual piano crafting to George Mesterhazy and Ahmad Jamal, Ms. Horn offers a well-crafted program of ballads, sprinkled with a few uptempo gems. Also providing support were Roy Hargrove on flugelhorn (""Take Love Easy"" and ""Ill Wind""), Ed Howard on bass, and Steve Williams on drums. Mr. Jamal provides thoughtful accompaniment on two other tracks, ""Maybe September"" and ""This is All I Ask.""Legendary arranger-composer Artie Butler, who composed ""Here's to Life"" for Ms. Horn, delivers another gem with the album's moving and heartfelt title track (...). This new song not only gave me the chills, but moved me to tears.I predict another Grammy nomination for this grande dame of jazz next year!"
4,About the song lengths....,"This is a great collection of big names from the twisted label, with some rare mixes to be found, but some of them are relatively short. It would have been great to have some of the readily available commercial releases eliminated from the disc and give us more of the rare mixes. Track times:CD11. hell's bells (5:53)2. new creation (5:07)3. Twist my brain (4:16)4. Lose It (4:38)5. Elements (4:10)6. biggest thing in Detroit (6:10)7. Fly (6:40)8. Burnin up (6:41)9.

It's my life (3:57)"
3,"Some parts of it work, some parts don't","It's odd to say about a book published only 10 years ago, but the main plot device seems a bit dated. Sadly, IED's and the various methods in which they can be detonated are in the news almost daily. The novel seems to have two main characters- Con Lindow and Commander Foyle, the latter being much more interesting. Foyle's dedication to his duty as he sees it is inspiring, and watching over his shoulder as he races against time to prevent another terrorist attack is thrilling stuff. Con Lindow doesn't seem fully fleshed out as a character. For example, he's injured in a bombing, wrongly imprisoned and interrogated, and then a day later- after learning of his brother's death- he's making eyes at a complete stranger who obviously has an ulterior motive. Lindow seems rather emotionless through all these developments. Oh, and spoiler alert: there is no ""steamy lovemaking"" depicted in the novel. Perfunctory, yes. Steamy, no."
4,Quirky redemption,Really liked the quirky Meris who came full circle to discover what really makes life full. It never is what we think it is when we are young and add in the mix of grunge friends who truly care and life spins for awhile. I watched it twice and see something different every time.
2,Music was good,"Stars for the music in this movie. It was okay I guess, I hate when sctors/actresses look into the camera, and this happens throughout the movie. I think the story line was in good taste, the film was just kinda ehh. But it's a good falling asleep movie. I actually watched it on netflix so it wasn't like I paid for it. I'm searching or this cambodian rock music though"
2,Pretty Awful but kind of insightful,"This movie was pretty pathetic. It drags on, and slowly gets better.It wallows in pathetic situations, kind of over does it.I regret paying to watch it."
5,Great Book,"I love all the Hank books, and this is a great one for the Christmas season. These books are hilarious and more important to the young reader, fun to read. I'd also check the rest of the series.Author of ""Hobo Finds A Home"" editor ""Of A Predatory Heart"""
4,Hank is cool,"I think this book is very good. I really think that if your a Hank fan you'll like this book. There's a series, but there all great. Read this book, you'll love it."
4,"sexy voice, loud guitars, and great music. What more can you ask for?","The music is great. the lyrics are too. Such songs as ""devil"", ""speaker 12"", and ""favorite sinner"" are thought-prevoking. Love, breakup, sex, alcohol/drug abuse are all covered here. And my goodness when she whispers ""slow down honey"" at the end of ""accelerate"", i instantly get shivers, at that time of the song I fall in love with her. She has a voice that is similar to Hope Sandoval but she seems more sincere than the Mazzy Star singer."
4,"Its good, but what happened?",This c.d is pretty amazing. The band has really shown what kind of talent they have with this c.d. But this band has changed drastically. They no longer have the street punk vibe that they once had. I wouldn't even consider this c.d punk. If you're into good christian punk then I suggest you pass on this c.d and check out some of the stuff Squad 5-0 has made.
3,Leather Conditioning,"I have only used the conditioner so far. The label says it will not ""stain"" leather. But the conditioner will turn leather darker if you use more than a little mist and brushed in per the instructions. After about about two weeks, the leather will revert to nearly its original color. Applying the conditioner is tricky. I used a clean shoe-shine brush to make it easier and faster. The conditioner will make nu-buck leather shiny. The shine will fade, though. Not sure what it will do to suede. But the conditioner does prevent my nu-buck leather from drying. The conditioner has a strange fatty smell. But it will go away after a while, if not completely."
5,Game is awesome!,Game is awesome! It has good graphics and it is very fun. I would recommend it to a friend. Try it out!
2,Oval racing is BORING,"This game sucks. If I wanted to race around and around an oval I would have gotten a NASCAR game. I literally fell asleep playing this game. After about 5 laps there is no point. You just go around and around until you catch up to a car in front of you and then you pass it. The graphics look like something from Sega Dreamcast at best. The sound is okay. I guess you get what you pay for. Save your $20! Rent this game if you just have see for yourself, but you've been warned. Don't be sucker for a low price like I was."
2,There must be someting better than the WS2308,"We have had the WS2308 system for almost two years, it seems to be the same stuff without the Weather Channel logo. The outdoor components have been nothing but trouble. Naturally the first failure was after the warrantee expired. My husband has replaced two of them. I'm not sure which two, but I believe the thermo-hygro has been replaced at least once, and it now does not work again. The batteries are the first thing we checked, of course, but that has not been the problem. This has been a constant frustration. I'm now looking for a thermo-hygro replacement again because the system was expensive (more than the Amazon price here) and I do want to make it work!"
2,Will not work with 64-bit OS,"I used and enjoyed this ""super thermometer"" for over 2 years, until I got a new 64-bit computer, which of course doesn't have a serial port. I was told by technical support that it will not work. At least I didn't buy an adapter."
2,Disappointing PC interface/software,"The device works well enough, but I am disappointed it is not a continual feed, and some of the info must be dug out from several menu layers.The primary disappointment for me is that the units requires a SERIAL port to communicate with a PC. A SERIAL PORT? What is this 1985? Come on guys - get to the age of USB - or even better - wireless. Serial port? You must be joking.Even worse - the directions specifically say that it WILL NOT WORK WITH A SERIAL TO USB ADAPTER - and I have found that to be correct.The software leaves much to be desired as well.If I were to do it again... I wouldn't"
4,Slimfast Optima really does keep you from being hungry.,"My husband and I both prefer something quick and easy for breakfast on the go and Slimfast is our choice. The taste is great (we only use chocolate) and it really does keep us from being hungry for about 4 hours. We have it on the way to church and don't think about food until church is over. The have a ""low carb"" version of Slimfast but it's much more expensive and unlike Optima doesn't keep you from getting hungry. I really wish there was a non-sugar version."
1,Repugnant taste - Milk Chocolate,"After having had a subscribe-and-save subscription which somehow got converted over to another vendor... Apparently the prior subscription was for the Chocolate Royale, because the Milk Chocolate swill tastes absolutely terrible. It tastes like it has gone bad, is sour, is bitter and generally seems to be of poor quality.I have, since the product was unavailable for some time, taken delivery of the Atkins drinks which are milk chocolate as well, and the Atkins drinks, in addition to being less sugar, taste fantastic.I cannot abide by the Milk Chocolate Slim Fast shake taste. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I am now squarely opposed to this product."
3,Satisfying and convenient,"I've always had a problem eating breakfast on workdays and this shake is quick and convenient. The flavors are tasty and it satisfies my hunger pangs for a couple of hours. But honestly, the claim that it sustains you for 4 hours is exaggerated. I found myself getting hungry for lunch after 2. Also, I'm concerned about the high sugar and carb content. But I would recommend this as a meal replacement for the convenience and ""decadent"" flavors."
2,hate the new bottles/higher cost,"I was a regular customer of the canned shakes for lunch and breakfast on the go, but I hate the new plastic bottles and won't pay more for such goofy packaging. I've stopped buying."
3,"Great tasting, but......","It taste great, but it makes my pee smell exactly like the drink... I can get past that though, and continue to stay on this drink for my diet..."
2,"Great product, WAY too expensive now!","I would rate SlimFast a 5 star... or at least I would have until they jacked the prices up so high. The product actually does work! I went from a size 6/7 in pants to a size 2/3 in 3 months. I felt fine and healthy, no issues to report. I was paying $23 and change for a 24 pack (cans), which was very reasonable with the free shipping. (They arrived quickly, too.) Now they're charging $65-$70 for the same product, and the 20 pack bottles aren't much cheaper. Boo, Amazon! Bring the good prices back!"
5,Yummy,"I love Slim Fast and not because they work, but because I actually enjoy the flavors. I'm a pretty bland girl, so I find the French Vanilla to be my favorite choice right next to chocolate. I like to stick these in the freezer before lunch so they are nice and chilled."
4,Slim Fast,"My husband has one of these every work day morning for breakfast. They are quick, easy, portable, and best of all, ready. It's so easy to order them from Amazon and have them delivered to the front door."
5,Quick and Yummy,I love Slim Fast Cappuccino Delight and never seem to find it in the stores. I got it here on Amazon easily and it was shipped quickly. Now I can go back on a semi diet. Thank you Amazon
3,Tastes good but other than that...,"Bought this and the vanilla flavor in hopes of a ""quick fix"" diet. It is fortified and is helpful for getting your daily vitamins and minerals. It didn't personally work for me as a meal replacement, but it helped when I wanted a snack between meals and/or had a sweet tooth. I suggest storing this in the fridge as it tastes better when cold and best if you have the time to blend it with ice into a smoothie of sorts. Downside to this product is that it's really sweet, so I diluted with a half cup of water each time. It also isn't high in protein, which helps keep you full so you can either add in a scoop of whey protein (though, this adds on more calories) or just try a flavored protein drink instead. Overall, I didn't think this product helped me stay full or feel satiated while on my quick diet. I definitely don't recommend this as a long term dietary supplement because whole foods for the same amount of calories can sustain you longer (and for much cheaper!)"
4,Very Tasty!,"This does not taste like a ""diet"" shake. My husband has actually started drinking them too because he thinks they taste just like chocolate milk (and he is picky!). The only concern is that it is mostly made out of milk and sugar, so I'm not sure how much ""weight-loss"" benefits it has but I use it as part of a balanced calorie intake. And its great when you're out and don't want to buy fast-food! Good buy. Will buy again."
2,Healthy but tasteless,This is the first time I've tried the strawberry flavor and it will also be the last...this product just doesn't taste that great.
4,Mostly filling tastes ok good,If you open a slim fast shake and then drink it all morning during your work it lasts longer. It tastes pretty good.
2,Gross,I could hardly stomach these... hopefully the milk chocolate flavor is better. My hands down favorite is actually Costco's brand. Not chalky or weird at all. Don't have a Costco membership anymore though. :(
4,Better tasting than I thought,"I decided it was time to cut the fat and get back in shape and if this helps me suppress my appetite I'm all for it cause I actually like the taste, which I didn't expect. Only time will tell if they perform as intended, but so far so good in sticking to the plan. Will update this review later when I have some(or no) results."
5,Love it,I have a chocolate slim fast 11oz can with an apple twice per day (tastes great together)and an 80% vegetarian dinner usually under 800 calories and I've lost 12 lbs in 3 weeks. (about 1400-1500 calories per day with mild exercise)The price was good and shipping was fast.
1,Ripped off by another company! WTF?!,"I've been buying Slim-Fast cans (Cappuccino)for years and love it as a breakfast drink. Recently I found out that they're no longer offering it in cans. That I could accept but, if purchasing the new screw-top bottles (that I could give a rat's ass about...) I get only four per pack instead of six for the same price! Do companies think we're all clueless on math? I'd be paying the same for two less servings. They've lost my business completely. Slim-Fast, thanks for nothing! The ill-will alone would cause me to never come back."
5,This is the way to lose or maintain weight!,"Almost four years ago, I lost over 50 pounds by drinking Slimfast twice a day (normal meal for dinner). I have managed to maintain the weight loss ever since by drinking it for lunch. I highly recommend this product!"
3,"It works, but I found a better flavor alternative","I bought this thinking that SlimFast's version had to taste even better than the equate brand Ultra Weight Loss Shake I bought from the local big name store. I hated every can. The equate version tastes like Very Vanilla Silk Soymilk, which I love. SlimFast's version has a flavor that has a hint of vanilla but was just not pleasant. It's not a bad product, but the taste was not for me. I've lost weight on both, but prefer the big name store for the more vanilla flavor, cheaper price, and 10 less calories."
1,"High Carb, Unhealthy Drink","I thought I was ordering the low carb version, these are high carb, high sugar, very unhealthy drinks. Compare to the low-carb version."
3,it's really sweet...,"Definitely buy in a 4-pack, to try... This stuff is really sweet! As a meal replacement, I like the chocolate WAY better, however this one is a nice dessert treat. :)"
3,Good price on subscribe and save,I just took it down a couple of stars because the milk chocolate is so much better. But this also is cheaper than walmart on subscribe and save.
5,great breakfast replacement!,Love this stuff - helps me get my morning going with out too many calories and tastes great!
3,"I love maps, but wish I had ordered another atlas","I'm sure the AAA North American Road Atlas 2007 is accurate and complete, but the print font is very hard to read. Compared to an atlas I've had for 15 years, the details aren't as clear as I would have liked. In other words, trying to find specific towns is a chore, mainly because of the crowded information. I should have ordered the large print. I did not do that in the first place because I thought all of the towns and cities could not possibly be listed with larger print. So, I'm stuck with this version. That's one negative of not being able to hold it in one's hands and paging through the entire book before purchasing."
5,The heart of Vermont,"I first heard Diane Zeigler live during ""First Night"" celebrations in Burlington, Vermont, back in the late 1990s. I was immediately captivated, and bought Sting of the Honeybee on tape. I subsequently bought the CD, and purchased it again after it went with the divorce. If three purchases of the same album doesn't say something about the quality and heart of this extraordinary singer, I don't know what does!I'm thrilled to see that she's producing again; she ""retired"" for a time. I just finished downloading her other albums, and can't wait to give them all a complete listen.Former Vermonters and folk music lovers of all kinds CANNOT go wrong with Diane!"
4,My daughter loves it!,i looked online for several weeks before deciding on the baby Einstein entertainer. It was easy to assemble when i got it home. My daughter who is 4 mo. will play happily in this for 10-15 min at a time. She loves looking at at the toys and will even push buttons. It is well worth the money.
4,Love this Gym,"My 5 month old son LOVES this gym.. it is fun, educational and it keeps him occupied for long periods of time if I need to get something done around the house. It has many things to do on it.. and it also teaches both English and Spanish words. His favorite is the little round twisty things that make noise when you turn them. This item is a little more expensive but worth the money.. it's sturdy and durable. The reason I took away a star was because one of the little leg attachments along the bottom that make the gym stand still.. kept on falling through the hole because the plastic piece wasn't strong enough. I had to place a napkin inside so it wouldn't move. Now it's fine. Still in all, I recommend this item to any Mom.. also a great shower gift idea."
2,Unstable Due to Little Red Feet,"At 15 weeks old, my son has just begun to get some use out of this toy. I started to put him into this gadget a couple of weeks ago for a few minutes at a time to strengthen his neck because he HATES tummy time. Unfortunately, despite the fact that he has only been in it a handful of times, the little red feet that are supposed to stabilize it DO NOT WORK! The very first time I put him into it one of the feet gave out (and my guy was probably only about 14 1/2 lbs at the time). Don't get me wrong, he loves the toys and sounds that it makes, but I have had to prop various items under the lip of the base to keep him from toppling forward and/or backward depending on the little red foot that decides to give out at the mnoment. Needless to say, I will be exchanging this for a more stable saucer on my next trip to BRU for diapers!"
3,Just OK,"My almost 7 month old son is outgrowing this toy. He would much rather be crawling around on the floor. It seems to me that he got bored of the toys on this quickly. He has the smartsteps exersaucer at Grandma's and he LOVES it. He can stay in that one for a long time. There so much for him to play with. I would highly recommend getting that one. It's a bit more but so worth it. I didn't have any problems with the durability of Einstein play center, but I think that the puppet is useless on this toy. Also, he wasn't impressed with the talking circle thingy."
1,Great Investment!,"My husband and I took weeks looking at all of the available exersaucers out there! We compared number of activities, price, etc. Ultimately we ended up ordering the Baby Einstein Exersaucer and our son loves it! He is 5 1/2 months old and loves to play in it. The activities are great! I like that it has the height adjustment so that he can grow into it. I would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for an educational/fun toy for their infant."
2,SOMETHING TO CONSIDER !!,"The height of this product is good for babies that are taller of length than the original age. As my baby is 30"" tall of 10 months age, she outgrew the length of the step and play piano. I had to buy her an entertainer which is higher so she won't fall out of it when bending over. But as me or my family never had pets, we didn't know that she would be scared of the sounds it would make, such as cow, dog, duck and lion on this product. So please take this into consideration when buying the product."
3,Just OK,"My son seems to like it, and for myself- well, not so much.The book with the dog picture and mirror NEVER stays on. My son will often chew it or throw it across the room. Some of the toys are cloth and can be a pain to clean. I wish I had a saucer that ""bounced"" as there is one at the day care where my little guy goes, and he seems to enjoy it much better.Upsides are the bright colors, and interesting (although very brief) music."
3,hard to clean,"The product itself is very good and entertaining for my son, but if you like to keep items clean, this one is tough. We have both this item and an Evenflo and getting the seat cover on and off the evenflo is SO much easier, yet it's just as sturdy (and the height is better). The seat covers get pretty dirty, so we use the evenflo much more than the BE. I really don't understand why the Baby Einstein seat is set up the way it is - it's a real pain."
5,Excellent Product,"My son loves this entertainer and can spend up to an hour (and he is only 6.5 months old) playing in it with no signs of getting bored. The toys and attachments are well secured if you are a stickler for safety - so far nothing has dislogded from its position on the base. The seat cover is a little difficult to remove for washing (but I don't mind because apart from the minor finger scratches getting it off, I know that the hooks keep my baby safely in the seat during play). Also easy to clean, as I have learned since my son spits up over everything when he gets excited. Great entertainer with just enough action to keep your baby involved without over-stimulating."
5,What a great choice!,"I registered for this toy on the enthusiastic recommendation of a mother in Babies R Us. I am so glad that I did! My son loves it. He plays with all of the brightly colored and visually stimulating toys, but the sound box is his favorite. He enjoys the animal sounds and the music that each one plays. He looks so pleased with himself when he gets it to play! Our little man loves to bounce and, since we took the supports off the bottom, he can rock the saucer and turn and really move around. This is good because he hated the swing, carseat and such because they confined his movement too much. I enthusiastically recommend this toy for active babies and moms who need a safe place to entertain baby while they do chores."
4,Watch the ribbon!,"For the most part, I am very pleased with this product. My daughter enjoys it and chews on everything in it (especially the cloth things) which is what prompted my writing this review. The upright picture and cloth shape caddy with the ribbon on top isn't the safest thing. My daughter liked to chew and suck on the ribbon, which I didn't see a problem with until the ribbon started fraying. Another time it wrapped around her fingers as she played with it. I trimmed the ribbon but it frayed again and began to ""string"" again so I cut it off. Other than that, it's been fun for her."
5,Great Toy,This toy was given to my son at 4 months of age. He is a big boy and has never had any problems touching the bottom. It also has adjustable height so that it will grow with him. He loves pushing the buttons to make the animals sing. And when the duck quacks so does he!! Great investment!!
3,Not what I hoped for,"My daughter is only 6 months old and I've already had so many problems with this activity center. The first one was with the soft stacked shapes. They had a plastic covering that my daughter managed to chew off (before she had teeth). The plastic was peeling and flaking off. Graco sent me a replacement part which I was very happy about except that the plastic connectors in between the shapes are so loose that my daughter now gets her fingers pinched by them. She then some how managed to break the caterpillar. The yellow tube that the balls run on broke apart. She frequently takes the star off as well but that may be part of the design; I'm not positive if this is intended or not. Before it started falling apart though, she absolutely loved it. I've only had it for 3 months; I guess I expected it to last longer."
5,EXCITING FOR BABIES,"My baby was three months old when we got this for him. I knew I needed something that would keep him active and entertained, but sitting up. He had a few bouncy seats that he liked for short periods of time, but when he got into this exersaucer they were just faint memories for him! He plays in this for at least 20- 30 minutes all by himself, sometimes more. That means I get to eat breakfast now! :-) I bought it at least a month ago and he plays in it every day--it never seems to bore him. He cannot sit up by himself yet so this is the perfect toy. He leans over toward the playthings and can lean himself back when he wants a different angle. It is the BEST!"
3,Jules,"My baby loves the activity center and is able to spin around freely, however, the legs to hold it stationary will not stay put and a few of the toys have broken off. Overall, it's a pretty good product."
4,baby einstein play activity,I was not happy with the shipping. the item was not shipped inside another box therefore it looked horrible. It was a gift for a babyshower and I was embarresed.
5,A babies favorite toy!,After reading all of the great reviews for this we had to register for it and I'm so grateful we did. Our daughter LOVES this!! She is almost 5 months and has been using it for a couple of months now. This is the one toy I know I can put her in and get a few things done around the house. There are so many bells & whistles - great stimulation for a growing mind! She never gets bored with it.
3,it's nice but lacking,"I purchased this exersaucer to keep at my parents house and thought it appeared to be stimulating. After putting it together and testing the baby in it I found a few issues. The first issue is that the lowest height on it had our son reaching to touch the base. Second, when our son tries to bounce in it as he does the Little Tykes model we have at home, he can't bounce. Finally, even though it appears stimulating he is easily bored with the toys. Overall, I would have expected more for the money and from Baby Einstein."
3,Great for entertaining but could use some improvements re: support,"I registered for the Baby Einstein Activity Center for a baby shower gift since I read so many positive comments about it. I must agree that my son, who is 6 months, is truly engaged when he swivels around playing and manipulating all of the different items. He adores looking at himself in the mirror and loves to bang on the animal buttons so that they make sounds. I can usually get about 20 minutes of ""free time"" when he is in the activity center. However, I have had two different centers and both have had the red supports give out. I had contacted Baby Einstein & Graco and they sent me a new one but unfortunately, the same thing happened! My child is 6 months old and about 18 pounds, so he is not overweight and is not Hercules, therefore it is just poorly constructed. I do hope that they improve this problem b/c my child does love it and I enjoy seeing him get excited and giggle."
3,good and bad,"We got this activity center for our first child. The only problems we had with it were that the three stacking toy is not good for a baby who likes to chew things! The red dye came off all over her mouth. I cut the toy off. (I saw the other review with the same toy problem- choking on the cellophane.) I think that the Evenflo one seemed more interesting to my friend's baby. Also, the comment about the Spanish being bad is true. It's also very fuzzy and hard to hear any of it. Sometimes the sound is the wrong sound for the wrong animal. However, it's nice because some of the toys are interesting. Also, it works better for taller babies than the evenflo one."
4,One of her favorite toys!,"This is definitely one of my daughter's favorite toys. It has a ton of fun activites for her. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the underneath part of the tray has some rough plastic edges and if she bends her legs while I'm lifting her out, she gets scratches on her legs. For such a great quality item, you think they would know better. I still recommend it, though!"
5,WHAT A LIFESAVER!,"This is the one of the best things we've bought our baby. She absolutely loves it. She will stay in it playing for long periods of time without getting bored. It's the only thing I can put my baby in that will give me time to do other things around the house. She's even tired of the swing and bouncy seat. We got it when she was only 4 months old, and even at that young age, we could adjust it so her feet could reach the bottom. We slowly over the days watched her become more and more interested and interactive w/the toys. All of the toys are safe and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this over the exersaucers as I have had friends who haven't been as pleased with those. This is definitely worth every penny!!"
1,Disappointed,"I love baby eintstien products, but this one fell short. It arived without all of the pieces, so they had to send me another one. The second one was missing pieces too. Between the two, I finally got everything. After putting it together, I noticed the top leaned to one side. The large peice that makes animal sounds is too heavy for the unsupported placement. The stuffed piece with the shaped did not last long. My baby pulled it off right away and it would not go back on."
3,"Entertaining, but unstable",I bought this when my son was 6 months old and have gotten great use out of it for 5 months. The toys are really stimulating and helped him develop different fine motor skills from turning pages to moving beads over an arch to spinning a globe. The spinning seat helps with his leg mobility. After his meals it was a perfect place to help him digest. The most disappointing are the feet that snapped out of place even after all the base parts were replaced by Graco.
3,Not the best,"There aren't enough toys to keep my baby interested. In addition, the seat cover is EXTREMELY difficult to put on and take out to wash. I returned this and payed an extra $20 for the Evenflo Exersaucer, which was well worth it!"
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this toy for my 4 1/2 month old daughter who had become bored with her bouncy seat. With the price of this entertainer I was expecting her to fall in love with it, but I was disappointed with how long she likes to stay in it. 15 minutes is her limit. She likes the sun but the book is too difficult for her to move and even now at 5 mo. her feet still can't reach the bottom. I bought the Exersaucer to take to Grandparent's house and she LOVES it. I seriously have to take her out of it after like 30 minutes because she is still playing with it. She loves the toys that hang overhead and that unlike the Baby Einstein in bounces, not just spins."
3,"Baby Enjoys, But Durability Concern","My baby loves this activity center, however one of the legs keeps collapsing if on hard surface (like kitchen floor). It seems fine on our carpet. Other than that, the toy is wonderful and keeps her mind and hands busy while I get dinner going. She quickly learned to turn pages of the book, and now she turns the pages of all her books when we read together. She loves to chew on the teether toys."
1,WARNING!!! CHOKING HAZARD!!!,"This morning our 11 month old granddaughter was in the activity center watching TV with my husband right next to her. He noticed that she was choking. To make a long story short, we did the back blows on her back and kept her tilted on her tummy upside down. Waiting for the paramedics to arrive a piece of cellophane finally came out of her mouth and she was okay. After examining the play activity center we were horrified to discover that the piece of cellophane had come off of the 3 stack toy. The cellophane covers the pictures on the toy and our granddaughter had picked the cellophane off and put it in her mouth. We wanted to warn other users of this choking hazard. This toy should be removed from the activity center immediately. We will be contacting Graco, and everyone else that we can think of to get this problem resolved. It makes us sick to think of what a senseless tradgedy could have occured, due the activity center that she enjoyed so much."
5,Excellent activity center,"This center is one of the best purchases we have made for our 7-month old daughter. She absolutely loves it, especially the rollers and the buttons that make animal noises and play music when pressed. She usually spends 10-15 minutes in the activity center at a time and doesn't mind playing in it more than once a day. It was very easy to set up and has withstood some very serious banging and chewing! We've had the activity center for over 2 months. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Paint comes off - be aware,"This product was great, until my baby started to chew on the caterpillar and the yellow paint on the balls started to come off. Even if it is not lead paint (which they claim) I still don't want my baby to eat paint!!! What are they thinking painting chewable toy for infants. Just unreal....I am returning this product and looking info different toys."
4,Baby loves it but stabilizer foot broke a month after purchase,"Overall we are happy with the purchase. Each week our daughter seems to discover something new about the toys and is captivated once again. The animal noise maker is a big hit and the noise/music is not annoying like some toys, plus it can be turned off which is a great feature. The only complaint I have is that one of the red stabilizer feet that keep the saucer from rocking broke after only a month (I would guess it was less than 10 hours of play time). We have to prop up one side with a book when we don't want her rocking."
5,Play Entertainer,"Great product. My baby loves it. She will play in it for a good hour. She especially loves the electronic attachment that makes the animal sounds. There are also plenty of things to chew on for the teething baby. I put extra little toys in the extra spaces, too I'm very glad I ordered this product!"
4,A good product,"I bought this exersaucer for my 6 month old daughter who has down syndrome. The quality is good and the variety of toys attached are really nice. Kyley was uncertain at first, but after a few weeks started enjoying it more. Now at seven months she likes it a lot and it has helped strengthen her legs. I think this a product that will continue to be enjoyed by her as she gets older. Kyley is not small for her age and a few of the objects are hard for her to reach at this time. Overall a well made product."
4,Great Play Center,"My daughter really enjoys this play center. Her favorite parts are the rollers and the sun. She enjoys smiling at the sun everytime she is in it. The only drawback that I have for it is that she is small. She was 5 pounds 8 ounces at birth and is developmentally ready for this kind of toy, but she still is very petite for her age, and has trouble reaching certain things. Overall a wonderful toy."
1,Recieved previously opened box,"This is unacceptable! At a store, I would NEVER accept a toy meant for an infant that had been opened and re-taped shut (this is a /safety/ issue!). Amazon thought nothing of sending a child's toy that had obviously been opened, possibly returned, and very sloppily re-taped shut.I called the 800 number provided on the web site for returning merchandise, sat on hold for 20+ minutes! only to be told that ""The voice mailbox for this number is full...Please try again later"".What a NIGHTMARE!!! I am SO done with Amazon. 50% of everything I buy I have problems with. Unless you LIKE the headache's associated with sitting on hold, NEVER dealing with a human being, shipping back defective merchandise, etc. Just go to the store. You will ultimately save yourself so much heartache.F...Amazon!"
1,How do people not see the connection?,"This product may as well be renamed the Neglect-o-baby. I just read a review of it that stated ""I put Sy in when she was about five months when she could almost sit up and completely hold her head and upper body up steadily."" Not three sentences later she concluded with ""...since Sy did not even crawl until she was 11 months old, it was awesome for her! (gearheadmom . com)""Of course she didn't crawl, she had no reason to develop the skill because she was being supported by a giant baby sling.Kids are going to crawl and the sooner the better. Junk like this just retards the development of natural motor skills."
1,Poor shipping,"I never got a chance to own this item. It was shipped to me twice, and both times the packaging was damaged and parts were missing. It was sent in the original carton, and not wrapped for shipping."
1,"product fine, box very damaged","If it wasn't a Christmas gift the torn and crushed box wouldn't have mattered. I could have assembled the play center and thrown the box away.However, since it was Christmas, I had to use the beat up box and wrap it as best and as messy as possible. I had to apologize for the condition and insist all the parts and pieces were there.You shipped it in the play center box. No additional protection or packing. Not good.Thanks for asking,Jim Mulholland"
5,Great!,"My child is almost 7 months old and desperate for thought-provoking activity. This activity center provides multi-sensory stimulation. In addition to sitting or standing when-ready height adjustment, the colors and textures invite touch and taste, different shapes that can be pulled by the child toward him/herself, sounds (music, words, rattles), buttons to push, discs to spin. I had a few problems during assembly, but amazon quickly sent out a replacement, totally free of charge and I downloaded a return sticker so that I was able to send back the broken items free. All in all, I am very pleased with this and the only negative is that in the beginning, the child can become over stimulated, in which case, just remove some of the toys."
5,Great,"My 5 mo. old loves it! The only toy he has problems with is the book. The pages are hard to turn. He plays with every toy on it, though. When he first started playing in it, he would stare at the sun and play with the rollers, but now he plays with everything."
2,Don't do it--you can do better!,"We registered and recieved the Baby Einstein Center thinking that we were getting the most edicational product for our child--atleast for stationary entertainers. We were wrong. You can't understand the spanish and quite frankly it is boring. A friend had bought the Exersaucer (new model) for her son and my daughter fell in love with it (even at 4 months). So, we packed up the Baby Einstein and took it back and came home with the Exersaucer. Yes it is more money, but it is also more fun and you can buy different toys to stitch in and out. Invest in fun---being a kid is not all learning spanish and english but also learning what fun is as well as cause and effect!!"
4,Great Discover & Play Activity Center,"My daugter is 6 months and cannot stay in one place for long, but when I put her in this she absolutely loves it. If she gets bored of one thing she moves on to the next and she already seems to know how to make the animal sound effects/classical music work the way she wants it to.The only thing I dislike about this product is that the dragon hand puppet and the seat isn't removable so that I can wash them."
1,"mildly entertaining for baby, but wicked ANNOYING to clean.","We have one of these and it does keep the babies interest somewhat. Though I don't see the point to the hand puppet, and the blue spinning thing with the metal in it sounds as if they didn't put more than 1 washer in it. Also the sun isn't quite flexible enough for baby to chew on easily. But our daughter LOVES the sound generator.Anyway, compared to other brands I dislike this product on two grounds.One, it is damn near impossible to clean. Nothing snaps in or out, it is VERY annoying to disassemble. 1/10 for cleaning. Anyone who's even been around children realizes how important this is, no idea why this is so awful.Two, it isn't portable at all. Many of the competing products fold down shorter for tossing into the trunk or front seat. This is fixed in size or taller if needed. the top and bottom do not easily pop apart without tools either."
2,Maybe mine was defective?,"I've had a few exersaucers and was very excited when Baby Einstein came out with theirs. My son loved it, but the problem we had was that the toys (the ones that were pre-attached and the ones we attached)are not anchored well and keep falling off. Some I was able to re-attach after getting creative, others, like the star and the soft blocks I can't get back on at all. Also, the screws for the animal sounds toy weren't long enough and so that toy (the one that makes the animal sounds & music and says the animal's name in 2 languages) kept falling off as well.I gave my other exersaucers to my daycare and after 3 years they're still in one piece, if this one would just stay together it would've been great."
3,Disappointed,"I had read so many positive reviews on this activity center that I was disappointed by the quality and educational value of this activity center when I actually got it. In particular, the feet of the saucer have a tendency to collapse with very little weight, making the unit lopsided most of the time. In addition, the ""book"" of pictures with the dog, cow and other animals is virtually impossible for the baby to turn because the holes that attach the pages are not large enough. Even for me, it take some effort! The main things that she loves about this saucer are the spinning wheels, the music box with animal sounds and the dragon puppet. She also loves being able to stand on her tiptoes! But at 5 months old, she still can't reach the other toys yet, most of which, however, aren't that exciting.However, on a positive note, just being able to put her down in a safe environment that keeps her moderately entertained is a life saver!"
2,would not recommend,"I was very disappointed as I put this together. My daughter was 4 months old at that point and over 95% pecentile in height to this day (she is 9 months). My inlaws and parents had assembled their exersaucer at their houses (other brands) and my daughter loved it and played for close to 1/2 hour in them. The Baby Einstein is much too high even at the lowest level. She could not touch the ground until about 6 1/2 months and cannot turn the seat easily. The toys are fine, but for double the price of some of the others, my daughter still will only stay in this one for about 10 minutes where she goes crazy in the other ones for 1/2 the price. I would not buy this again and I am having another child and have to go buy a different one."
3,"beware, can be dangerous","I have a similar vesion of this exersaucer/stationary walker. When my son was 7mths old he was rocking the thing back and forth and actually flipped the entire system over on top of himself. I was freaking out, thinking he broke his neck. Just be careful if your child likes to rock in the saucer! I called the company and they said they had never had anything like that happen before and asked me if he was flat footed or tippy toed when using the thing. They said if the child can stand in it flat footed then they should not be in it. News to me. I never read it anywhere in the instructions. I have no clue where that one came from. Overall the product is good, but just be careful of rocking babies."
2,Not worth it!,"When my son first tried it (at 5months) he seemed to like it, for a day. The next day, he wasn't interested in it anymore. Then I got him rainforest jumperoo by fisher price, much better choice! The jumperoo, he could play for hours, but when he plays with the graco einstein, he's bored after 10 minutes."
3,"It's great, BUT.....","I put my daughter in the Baby Einstein activity Center when she was 3 months old, and she becomes increasingly more entertained the older she gets. I like that the table has room for smaller toys she can pick up and chew on, as well as leaving her to stand, which she loves to do. HOWEVER....the electronic/musical portion of the toy worked for about a week and then shorted out. We improvised by removing it from the activity center, which my daughter doesn't even notice, and my 4 year old son likes to take apart the defunct musical toy and look inside at the wires, so I guess everybody wins, but STILL...I would have liked for my daughter to get that experience of pressing buttons that light up and make animal sounds."
1,A little concerned,"My daughter just loves this toy but the legs keep collapsing, she is only 11 lbs. I have tried to contact the company about this but the e-mail keeps being returned - no such address, I used the e-mail on the Baby Einstein site itself. It's too bad really as she simply loved it but it is too dangerous for her to use."
1,Defective Parts Galore,"I have to agree with the Dad from Maryland. I have purchased numerous Baby Einstein products for my son including all of the DVDs and most of the toys. We love all of them, but this item.This product is a nightmare and has numerous defective parts. The round musical box fell off the first time it was used (the screw would not hold it on), the cloth seat would not go back on after we took it off to wash it the first time and will not stay in place making the product unusable. A big disappointment to my son and his parents. It would also be great if the parts came off easier and were all machine washable. Don't waste your money on this one until they make some serious design changes."
2,"IMPOSSIBLE to clean.. paint chpped, unsanitary","Why in the world would you make a toy for babies to slobber on that is impossible to clean! I just spent 15 minutes trying to get the seat cover off, finally did, but I am not looking forward to getting it back on. And some of the toys are permanently mounted, and yet they have plush features that I can't just wipe clean. Also, other reviews are correct--the paint does chip off the hard plastic pieces, specifically the arch of balls.The evenflo exersaucer (which I also have...) is much preferable. Pieces snap out for cleaning, and no paint chips!"
3,"Paint chips, but the rest is good","Recently purchased for our 4.5 mo. old. Put the attachments in over time otherwise it seems like stimulation overload if you put them in all at once. Child shows frustration since all toys are fixed position. and can not be pulled closer. THE ATTACHMENT WITH 4 MOVABLE BALLS 'INCHWORM', THE NUBS ON THE BALLS CHIP PAINT WHEN THEY ARE INEVATABLY CHEWED ON. -I'd recomend not adding that toy. We've had a month and otherwise is good can focus on one toy at a time now. I'm also writing to the company on that paint."
4,4plus,If I could give this a 4.5 I would. It's great and my baby loves it. My only comment would be it's a bit of a pain to remove the seat for washing and my baby spits up a good bit so it get's washed a lot. That being said it is still very bright despite frequent wahings and I am honestly not sure what you could do to improve upon the design. My daughter really enjoys each toy on this item and it's easy for me to sit with her and play along. The seat seems to support her well also.
3,My son loved it.... But beware!!!!,"My son loved to play in this bouncer. There are many toys that kept him busy. He loved the star, globe and especially the three soft blocks. However, please be aware there was a recall on this item regarding the three soft blocks attachment. Older models had a plastic tip that if got loose may be a choking hazard. The newer models are fixed but if you have an older model the company with send you a new soft block piece to replace the old one."
5,((((((((((( WONDERFUL ))))))))))))))),"This Entertainer from Baby Einstein by far is the best!!!!!My son is 6 1/2 months old.....and goes nuts in this!!!Tonight, he was in it for 2 1/2 hrswhile watching Baby Einstein Videos!!!Really, we could not be happier!Baby Einstein productsare the best.Don't hessitate on this one,you won't be dissapointed!Oh, the little red pegs at the base should always be putdown if your baby is on the floor....common sense =)Great product,Sandra"
4,"Baby loves it, but the electronic toy could be better","My 4 month old boy loves his activity center. We chose it because there are alot of interactive toys to keep him stimulated compared to some others we looked at. The characters & music are also the same as on the Baby Einstein videos, which he also loves.Construction is also very sturdy...my little one is 75th % for height & weight and is never still, but we've had no problems with his activity center.Only drawback is the electronic toy...the spanish version of the animal names is difficult to understand because they're spoke too quickly and by children that don't speak spanish, so there's an accent. I am bilingual and was very dissapointed in this. It could also be improved by having all the animals light up rather than just the one in the center.Otherwise I would definately recommend this product."
2,AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!,Where do I begin... My son loved this at first until my sister got another brand and I saw all the lights and noise that one had. He got bored very fast with this one. One of the pieces came off so easily that I dont even know where it is abymore. I am giving it away so that my Daughter does not have to use it. Also one of the feet on is became so lose that when you would try to push it down that when you alked away it would just pop back up. It is also very hard to clean. The seat is very hard to get off to wash. Also when I would pull my son out the seat would always... I mean always come with him. The side that has the noise part is so heavy that now that side is warped down. Also not to mention most of the the other brands are easy to break down so that you can take them places. NOT THIS ONE. If I would have known about all of this I would NOT have bought it.
4,Be sure to remove plastic film!!,Nowhere in the instructions does it tell you that there is plastic film over the mirror (where the pictures of the animals are). It comes off pretty easily and your baby could easily try to eat it! Otherwise a great diversion for hungry little minds!!
5,ASTOUNDING RESEARCH AND EXTREMELY ENLIGHTENING,Braudels history of Commerce paints a vivid picture of how commerce has evolved. It is uniquely relative information for all individuals interested in creating wealth. As it deals how others marketed their goods and services in the past. The presentation of the information in the book is first-class. I am now rereading the book for the fourth time....
5,Rewards rereading,"This was the most interesting, to me, of Braudel's classic three-volume history of the age when vernacular culture first faced off against the predecessors of industrial culture. I dive into these books periodically and surface several hours later, having gone back in time."
1,Free kindle book has portion missing,"This is a collection of stories held together by a central narrative (think Canterbury Tales) But don't bother downloading this free book. You just get past the preliminary narrative and into the first tale and a large part of the first tale is missing! So you can make absolutely NO sense of the first story. (This was not a download problem because I re-downloaded and the segment was still missing.) Plus the formatting is bad throughout the book, with half lines of print. I reported the missing portion to Amazon and eventually it might get fixed, but for now you can download another copy of this book (Annotated version) for $2 which has a working Table of Contents allowing you to access any of the tales directly. I love Wilkie Collins and this book is worth reading if you are a fan, just skip this free version."
4,After Dark and Entertaining,"Enjoying English Literature as much as I do, I thoroughly enjoyed this Wilkie Collins collection of short stories. Sure, he's a bit long winded in places, but that just adds a bit more quaintness to the experience."
5,Nova Bossa - Carol Saboya,"Wow! What a wonderful c.d.! The writing and orchestration is absolutely incredible! Carol has a wonderful voice, and she sings with such ease! I highly recommend this c.d. for your library! BRAVO!!"
5,Tales from the Master,"Poe is one of the world's finest writers and this collection of stories is what he's all about. This book contains the best of his tales, with many others for you to explore on your own. It has his poems and short stores. Its contents is very close to being unabridged except, for it missing a few poems and stories that aren't very good anyway.Poe's tales contain all the excitement of a novel, in around 10 pages. I recommend this collection because it offers hours of enjoyment. The only thing you might need is a large vocabulary because he tends to have an advanced word choice. Get this book and have fun!"
3,Not like I remember them.,"These gloves are conceptually great, but CLC missed the mark on these babies. The grips are horribly weak, and when you lift a heavy box, and the gloves actually grip, they start to shift on your hands. These dont grip very well, or fit very well. I am overall disappointed. Not worth the price tag at all. Maybe good for someone that lifts little girly boxes all day, but not for a heavy lifting man."
3,A must in your musical education,"Everyone with an interest in good solid songwriting should know about Si Kahn. he's a union organiser from North Carolina. At least he was when I saw him years ago on tour in England. He was driving around with Roy Bailey in a car, doing folk clubs. He was on annual holidays from his unions job.Not a flash guitarrist, perhaps, but his songs oozed soul and reality, and he was a great raconteur on stage. Met him afterwards when we bought a few cassettes ( yeah, THAT long ago). He was full of dry humour and generosity.He doesn't seek the bigtime, has stuck to his vocation. And most of his songs I've come to know through other performers ( e.g. Dick gaughan, Fureys, Planxty, Eddi Reader, Roy Bailey ). that's the power and integrity of this fella.Great songs."
5,Coincidence? Look for the Message.,"I loved this book and when I finished reading it, I was so astounded at the number of coincidences occuring in my life that I realized were actually messages. It's so nice to get some guidance, thank you Deepak Chopra."
2,The Spontantous Fulfillment of Desire,"I didn't care for the method of presentation. Monotone!! I felt like I had to Work to hard to get what could have been verbalized with a easier approach. Deepak moves through ""Some"" material way to fast and seemed to come to a almost deadening halt going through Why the hand bones connected to the wrist bone, which is connected to the arm bone, etc....To each his own, but I found This one to have Way to much info that I still am wondering why it was in there?? I Gave my Cd's away. I recommend ""Ask and It Is Given-Part 1 (at least) by Esther & Jerry Hicks for The Law of Attraction."
5,Good book,I really enjoy most of Deepak Chopra's books. In this book he gives you more ways to look at your life and how your can enrich it.
2,DISAPPOINTED,This book was a disappointment. I got absolutely nothing out of it. No change in my life except I'm the price of it poorer and have still yet another book to clutter my home. I have read a lot of spiritual and newage books and again this one was way too deep and unaffective.
4,A polarizing evolution of the Trash Can Sinatras sound,"Since I first discovered the Trash Can Sinatras in 1990, I've consistently marvelled that more people aren't aware of their amazing sound. This, their second album, was a bit of a surprise to me. Although it has several incredible songs on it (my favorites are ""Send for Henny"" and ""I've Seen Everything"") I find myself less addicted to this album than their first. Perhaps it's that the sound seems unnecessarily more complicated or muddied. The revealing fact for me is that, while I cannot choose a favorite song from the first album, I can easily choose a top three or four from the second. Although this album is a must for any TCS fan, I would prefer the more spare and soulful melodies of the first."
2,"Where CAKE still lifts my spirt , this one is a nose dive","This recording doesn't possess the beautiful molodies found in their first effort ""Cake"". I scan the disk and try to find a memorible chord or riff and there is none to be found. I still listen the Cake and soar. Cake has been in the front of my CD rack for 9 years. I would love nothing more than the Sinatras go back to their roots and record what they do best."
5,Fave of the 90's,"Who knows why a certain disc can grab your attention and never let go? ""I've Seen Everything"" is my favorite cd of the 1990's (and I own a couple thousand). Brilliantly lush, more complex than the debut. Just a wonderful cd from start to finish."
3,Huge.,"This is a nice looking watch and unlike some other alarm watches, the alarm is easy to set. Unfortunately, the watch is very large in diameter--about the same as a sports watch. But whereas a sports watches have large bezels with meaningless numbers, this watch just has a big face. Its not terribly heavy or thick, just big. I hope Skagen will give it another try. A few millimeters less and it would be very elegant."
2,Not this translation,"This is the most amazing book I've ever read. I went to France for the sole purpose of learning french so that I could read this book. However, this is the worst and most disappointing translation I have ever seen. It has been re-written and re-authored in a postmodernist discourse that is untrue to the text. If you want to understand, read, and love Fanon, buy an earlier edition!!!"
2,"Great book, terrible translation",Frantz Fanon was a lucid writer with a knack for turning a phrase. Philcox butchers Fanon and strips his words of their power. Do yourself a favor and buy the earlier translation by Constance Farrington. It is the next best thing to learning french and reading Fanon's words in the language in which they were written.
2,A book I could not get through,"This book was recommended to my book club and boy oh boy it really was like digging through the ""Wretched of the Earth"" to read it. No one in the book club finished the book. Maybe I need to put some time and distance away from this book so I can look at it with fresh eyes.....but as it currently stands this is not a book I ever want to read for leisure."
4,A good reference,A great backdrop for a perspective on colonialism. This book in some cases can be applied to many cultural issues today.
2,Fanon: The First Structural Psychiatrist,There are 40 pages describing the psychiatric work of Dr. Frantz Fanon. This is an excellent book for those working with people from other countries; for those conducting community and doing family therapy with the urban poor families. Fanon was the first structural psychiatrist.
3,Sartre's Intro Priceless,Not a huge fan of the book itself but Satre's introduction is phenominal. Satre hits the nail on the head.
4,A brilliant defence of freedom for the developing world and its people,"The basic premise that decolonization is a violent phenomenon still seems pretty revolutionary to me, as do his attempts to analyze the effects of colonization on the psychology of the native. I'm not sure if I buy his 3-step method by which colonized people develop their own culture, the clinical way he describes the native turning first to then from the colonizers culture, ultimately arriving at this almost Hegelian synthesis just feels too simplistic, too much like generic agitprop. His conclusion, that the third world has to rise to the task of protecting and taking back liberal humanism from European hypocrisy, (and that they have to do it on their own terms) might be overly idealistic, but its a kind of idealism which is very hard not to agree with by the time he's done making his case. It's easy to see how this became a big influence for people like Malcolm X and Edward Said."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!,THE BOX LOOKS PRETTY LIKE MOST OTHER HOME DESIGN PROGRAMS BUT THIS SOFTWARE IS GARBAGE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I SUGGEST BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS HOME DESIGNER AND HOME DESIGNER 6.0 THEY ARE EXCELLENT PROGRAMS WITH AN EASY LEARNING CURVE.
4,"A fun, intuitive program",I have found this program to be an great tool for creating home designs. Using this program to create rooms is an excellent form of creative expression and also very practical when contemplating changes in your own home.
4,long lost record!,it took me a long time to find this! this pop group never took off but the songs are great.
4,more than a bit,"My take on the album was that it fairly summed up the landscape of American life in the beginning of the century. Not a perfect world but the music is very fitting. If someone said it was cheesy or sentimental, I could understand, but it is not ""eh"". The people in the songs, truckers, teenagers, hopeless romantics, are real, flawed, damaged by loneliness, desperate and beautiful. Untethered in this world and yet coming back, saying ""I'm still alive"". That is worth it. Long ago, songs did not care if they were not cool, unembarrassed by the excess of their cry of love. Vance carries on that tradition. It's about realizing that you had something and then you lost it but you keep it alive with the yearning."
2,Missed the mark,"Best Tracks: Pound of Prevention, Jenny and the Tower, Just The Way That It WasThis was my second purchase of a Vance Gilbert album. His voice and style still shine on this album, but it left me saying 'ehh'. It's not terrible, it's just not his best effort. It, for the most part, just didn't speak to me.Maybe it's just where I am, or where Vance was...Maybe 2 and a half stars"
5,These Guys ROCK,This is one my Favorite Metal Bands of all time I have been following them for some time now and am shamefully just getting to this review I cant pick a song that I can say is my favorite They all are! This is a Required CD if you are a True Metal Fan
3,Hard to read display,I love the range of the phone. I love the features. I bought a Uniden 5.8 phone and I kept having to unplug it to receive a call but this one works fine except. THE DISPLAY IS VERY BLUE THE LETTERING IS ALSO BLUE THEREFORE YOU CAN NOT READ THE DISPLAY UNLESS YOU TILT THE PHONE. I think GE may need to redo this feature and also make the numbers visible so that they can be seen in the dark. The display is around the letters but in the dark you are still unable to view the letters and numbers. Back to the drawing board on this one GE. I am going to purchase another phone and take this one back. :-(
1,Absolutely Awful Phone,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! It is a piece of junk and I am still kicking myself for throwing away the box and now I can't return it.It is awful. It has a very short range and always goes out of range, which means that the call is dropped or the phone doesn't work at all. The ringer is the worst feature on this phone - instead of ringing, it just makes a little chirp so you don't hear the phone ring and miss calls. Also, when you turn the phone on, it takes 5 seconds to find a signal with the base so you are sitting there waiting and you can't dial or do anything. Finally, the ""interefence free"" sound quality is terrible, worse than on my analog 900mhz cordless phone.This has to be one of the worst cordless phones I have ever owned in my life. Avoid it!!"
3,difficult to read,"there is not much contrast between the hands and the face making it difficult to read.. it would have been much better if it had black hands,"
3,Watch,Product was what I thought it would be. No surprises to the purchase whatsever. Cheap watch but looks good on.
5,Best CD-R's You Can Buy - You Get What You Pay For!,"The Verbatim DataLifePlus discs have ""AZO"" dye in them, which provides a more durable, robust recordable disc than cheaper media. You can tell if a disc has AZO dye by the darker bluish color of the write surface as opposed to the pale green color of cheaper discs.Cheaper discs are more prone to burning errors, and will probably not last as long as discs like these. Verbatim DataLifePlus, or ones marked has having ""AZO"" or ""Super AZO"" dye just can't be beat if you want to archive or back up critical data that you can't afford to lose.I know this sounds like an advertisement, but I'm not the only one that feels this way. Go to[...] for some great guides and insights about blank media.Of course Taiyo Yuden/JVC is another great brand."
5,insightful performance,This is an excellent Cd of Martinu music not often recorded. Trio Tulsa plays with an insightful awareness that is difficult to master with Martinu. Their artistry and grasp of musical phrasing makes this recording a shear delight. The Duo No.2 for violin and cello is sublime!
1,Microsoft doesn't support their own products!,"I've been burned by Microsoft twice before with Sidewinder joysticks. The first time I bought one was when I had Windows 98. It was a Sidewinder Pro. Great joystick, plug n play, all that. When I migrated to Windows 2000, I found that the Sidewinder Pro was not supported (despite being analog--you'd think it would be easy to program drivers for it). I thought, ""Okay, maybe there are problems, blah blah blah."" I then bought a Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro, again, great product, plug n play, all that. Worked great. When I migrated again to Windows XP I found AGAIN it wasn't supported by Microsoft. There is NO reason why a company such as Microsoft cannot support their own products on their own operating system. I will NEVER buy a Sidewinder again. I can't trust them. Buy anything else. I've had great luck with the Wingman Digital Extreme--$28 at WalMart--excellent buy!"
1,Will NOT work,"Current operating systems will not recognize this unit nor is there any way of installing or using it. Check the dates of the reviews here, most are a decade old.I think this will work on XP if anyone still has that but they were designed for Windows 95."
1,Stay away,"I've owned a Sidewinder for a little over a year. In that year I have reinstalled the software more than 20 times. It seems that whenever I shut down the computer the device driver vanishes. This last time (and it will be the last time) I reinstalled the software and the joystick will still not work. Trying to contact tech support is a nightmare. Bouncing around the microsoft website is a joke. I've tried everything they have suggested, yet nothing. Acessing online tech support they notify me that tech support for this product is not available in the United States- apparently I flew to asia and purchased this product without my knowledge. The final answer to my question appears to be to not buy any Microsoft products."
4,Worked Good,"The seller did a great job getting it to me, I had it in 4 days, THANX. The product itself wasn't the best quality. The fitting for the low pressure side was cheaply made. It has a plastic peice inside that depresses the original valve. It cruched when I screwed it on, very easily. I had to drill out the old valve, drill out the plastic peice and install an o-ring to make it work. The rest was good, but 3 cans of freon is not enough, I had to use 4."
3,A Preacher becomes a bounty hunter,"This movie reminds of some older 40's westerns.The bad guy is really bad and runs the town, the good guy is a little confused, but basically good at heart. The loss of his wife and daughterby being blown up inside his church leaves this preacher a pretty broken man. He resists the temptation of revenge, but when the colonel tries to do the same thing all over to a new set of people,he seems to get his bearings back..."
2,Avenging Angle (2007),"I like Sorbo and some parts have some good dry humur, but I should have rented it first to check it out. If you are a B movie collector or a spagetti western collector this is a good choice."
2,BORRRRING,Don't waste your time and money with this.An insominiac would have a hard time staying awake with this HBO disappointment.
4,When i ordered this I kinda expected it to be bigger,Great read none-the less but the way it's written makes it really confusing to people who have never seen the form of language.
4,Great epic poem,"Gilgamesh is a great epic poem, particularly for me as a ""theology hobbyist"" it is pretty interesting to understand how other semitic cultures lived in the days before and after Noah, befor Abraham. It's also thought provoking in respect to how much it relates to various biblical accounts. The author does discuss this briefly in the introduction. Essentially, it has expanded my horizons..."
4,Good intro from diverse sources,"Although not an original translation, this redaction by N.K. Sanders combines versions Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite texts. The prose flows very well (almost like the King James Bible). The introductory history and map provide helpful background information.Its amazing though over 4,000 years old, that there are very modern elements. Here man first begins to define a ""self"". There is dream interpretation that historically is continued with Joseph in the Bible and still alive with Carl Jung. Some symbols, such as the slaying of the Lion are ancient and almost universal. The Flood story shows up here, and perhaps latter repeated (or in a new form) in the Bible and Noah, with new meaning. What's fun about these myths is that they are compact and open to interpretation. For example, I perhaps see the defeat of Humbaba (the guardian of the Cedar Forest), as the start of our environmental crisis."
2,"Great epic, bad edition","First off, I have never thaught I would give Gilgamesh anything less than five stars. However, I recently received Andrew George's translation (the more reccent translation in the Penguin Classics series) and earlier today got my hands on a copy of this edition and decided to compare them. I found this edition very incomplete (George's is currently the most complete form) and like another reviewer said an unneccisarilly long introduction (at least for a translation that short). So while I do recomend Gilgamesh to everybody I would not recomend this (N. K. Sandars) translation and would instead recomend the one by Andrew George (unless you want more myths from Babylon and that area in which case I would recomend Myths From Mesopotamia by Stephanie Dalley her translation while not as complete is still one of the best I've read)."
1,Cliched,"A Professor of Eng. Literature gave this work a rave review, however I found it cliched and with many references that have not aged well. It is very derivative and employs most of the generic stock events from B-grade paperbacks.Also, most of the jokes will be lost on readers, as they refer to events that long ago passed into the historical record.However, probably the novel's biggest problem is its attempt to do 'too much'. A lot like the recent film ""Clash of the Titans"", the author appears to have relied on introducing sensational mythical creatures in place of a well-fleshed-out storyline that engages with the modern reader."
2,School Related,"I had to read this book for school. I was tired of it after the first page. How was this story so popular back then? It's boring and unreal. C'mon! One guy lived with animans most of his life anf Gilgamesh was part god. I know a story of a real hero, Neo from The Matrix. That guy is cool and interesting. Also, he is cool to watch. Gilgamesh would never become a movie. People would fall asleep. Besides, any school book isn't fun to read."
5,Intriguing,"Haven't yet finished it wholly, but what I have read so far is a mixed situation. For myself I may need a companion book to help me a long, since certain passages have been difficult. I would though certainly recommend this as a must read book, and the author presents an exceptional introduction."
2,Missing parts of story!,"I bought this book on my Kindle for class, and it was missing several parts of the tablets! Not the complete finished version of the original book!"
1,It was horrible.,"I had to read it for a summer reading book. It was horrible. I mean, who wants to read all about the Ancient Sumarians?"
5,Great find!,"I need this book for my freshman orientation class and instead of paying fifteen dollars for a new (and taxed) copy, I bought it in near-perfect condition for seven bucks. This was a great find!"
3,this book is not so bad,"this book is a good tool to help you understand the poetic version of this story especially when doing school work however, some of the wording is tough to understand."
4,Not Much Has Changed,"The beauty in reading this is the understanding that not much has changed in the past 2500 years. Gilgamesh, 2500 years ago, wanted answers to the very same questions we ask ourselves today. He had the same frustrations, the same fears, the same concerns as we do now. It was a very interesting and reassuring read."
3,Should have been left as poetry,"Overall, a decent rendition. I was looking more for a direct translation of the poetry though, whereas this is a rendition of the already-translated poetry into prose form. I felt like it was dumbed down for the reader, but it's still Gilgamesh, and therefore a great story."
3,THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE BOOK EDITIONS...BE CAREFUL!!!,There are two different versions of this book being sold by Amazon.The one version is the more current and is translated by: Andrew GeorgeYou can get that one here:http://www.amazon.com/Epic-Gilgamesh-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449191/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1263331576&sr;=8-1Then there is the older version translated by: N.K. SandersYou can get that one here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014044100X/ref=oss_T15_productI needed the one by N.K. Sanders for my college class and bought the wrong one at first because I didn't know the difference.To make it nice and easy...The Andrew George Version has a pegasus (horse with wings) on the frontThe N.K. Sanders Version has (Stone people with Beards or monkeys) on the front.Be careful which one you buy so that you don't have to ship it back like I did.
4,Not her best work,"While I enjoyed this book, it is far from her best work. Zora seemed to ramble in this book -- and it is widely believed that she fabricated several stories contained within. I would recommend ""Their Eyes"" and ""Jonah's"" before reading this book..."
4,"Pefection, save the inaccuracies","As with any of her works, Zora being who she was has to weave in folklore, anthropology, history, and some of everything into her work. Her autbiography is no exception. She is truly one of the most poetic and artistic authors of all times. She knows how to play with words and phrases that keep you hooked; not necessarily for the content but because you are waiting to see what funny or thought-provoking thing she will say next.The only reason I had to rate this work four stars is because of a couple of inaccuracies. She claims to have been born in Eatonville, FL for one thing. This is not true according to U.S Census records. She also takes years off of her age, but never explicitly tells when she was born. Other than that, this is one of the most interesting autobiographies that you will ever read. Also one of the most inspiring."
5,Excellent read,"This Autobiography gave the impression that Zora was a realistic and she lived life to enjoy it. It focused entirely on her life along with her accomplishments. Zora was very open minded and willing to try different things, and she was not afraid of change. Zora realized that racism was everywhere but she was able to succeed even when she had to change strategies to be successful."
4,A great book,"It's a good read. Some parts will be slow, but many parts are really strange and wonderful. I especially like how Zora has to deal with discrimination from most races... excellent."
2,cheap...,"I hate to say it but this dresser was nothing but junk in the long run. The back of it is a thin piece of cardboard, the drawers never sat right in the tracks and the shipping took a long time only to have it arrive with scratches on it. I recently threw it out after less then two years of use because it was just garbage. Its a nice style, but the product itself is not good quality and not worth the money."
2,Great Style - Poor Quality,"Although the design is wonderful, I am very sorry to say I am greatly disappointed with the quality of this dresser.Many of the interior pieces have no finish applied to them, most notably the drawer backs. The back of dresser is a piece of cardboard which is nailed in place.Also disturbing is the top was damaged in several places, despite no damage to the shipping container. This seems to be a recurring problem, which other reviewers have mentioned. Most of the areas could be touched up, however one area in the left rear edge is dinged badly and is defying any means of touch up.One plus in addition to the style of the unit, is the drawer glides. They were challenging to install due to an error in the instructions, but they work wonderfully.For the money I would expect at least quality with all pieces finished inside and out and a laminated back to the dresser.I would also hope they package the top better to prevent the damage that seems to occur from shipping."
4,If first you don't succeed try try again....,I had a tough time trying to get this dresser(2 packages) shipped correctly to my house! It was partially shipped and Target customer service misguided me about the shipping arrangements. That was handled poorly! Target directed me to return the partial shippment with a full refund. Well I still wanted this dresser and come to find out it was cheaper than before. I ordered it again and received both packages at the same time! If you spend more than 2 hours assembling it and use wood glue(not provided)things will stay intact. If you think your going to get a assembled dresser that is $500-$700 at your local furniture store your a fool! I do like the product I received but the overall buying furniture at Target experience could use improvement.
1,Looks are deceving!!!! This sucks!,"Unlike the other customers who reviewed this item, I am COMPLETELY DISSAPPOINTED with the quality of this WAY OVER-PRICED dresser. My father, a carpenter, put it together for me, and it took him about 2 hours. Once it was finished we noticed a ll the chips, cracks and scratches from shipping, and all we were provided was a black marker to conceal them. After only a week or so the bottoms of the drawer refused to stay in place, the cheap particle board used is easily damaged.Luckily I did not purchase anything else in the series, we will now put this in the spare bedroom and buy a new suite for our bedroom."
3,Why is this item always temporarily unavailable???,"I really like the look of the Pablo Espresso bedroom furniture and would like to purchase the 7 drawer dresser, 2 - Nightstands and possibly the headboard."
2,NOT Pottery Barn!,"If what you're looking for is lush, plush truly thick towels, these are NOT it. If you want Pottery Barn luxe, you'll have to go there. These are a poor substitute. I could not have been more disappointed. I returned them all."
5,Duck Rocks!,I was privileged to have an advance reader's copy courtesy of PTD! I could hardly put the book down. While I enjoyed all 3 of the novellas I remain partial to PTD. He has a great writing style and his characters are believable and lifelike...am waiting with bated breath for his next offering.
4,Playa's No More?,"All 3 of these author's novellas were the bomb! Playa's can be reformed if they let down their guard, forget about the games and allow someone into their minds and hearts and not just their bedroom. You be the judge..."
5,Wonderful!,When my niece and I visited Paris in May 2011 we didn't find time to visit Musee D'Orsay. I bought this for her and browsed through it when it arrived. So many beautiful paintings - it is a must for those who enjoy the impressionist painters.
4,power metal rules,"Why do all these people rag on power metal?!!! If you don't like the music AT ALL, then you probably shouldn't be writing a review of a power metal album! And why does listening to power metal make us geeks!!! I love power metal as a beautiful, melodic form of music. And Death Metal fans are the LAST people who should be commenting on musical taste!!! Who the Hell wants to listen to a singer growl at the top of his lungs while the rest of the band plays their instruments as fast as they possibly can!!! You call that music?! Try listening to Iced Earth's latest album to hear what REAL metal sounds like!!!"
4,"hey, all the guitarists out there!","for every guitarist (i mean serious ones), there comes a time when you sit and realize the sense of what you play and also of what you listen to. in my case, listening to this album made me think that you can do things great and bad at the same time. why? ok, the arrangments are awesome, the songs too. but Turilli's work sometimes is just... overplayed. for an example, on ""land of inmortals"" you can't understand a damn note of what he's playing. too much technique, too much velocity... very little sense or meaning into the solos. anyway, it's a very good album."
5,I will search for the eeee-merald sword!!!!!!,"Man, this is still my favorite Rhapsody album (but, Dawn of Victory is a close second). Every track stands out and has its own unique feel while still supporting the whole concept/theme of the album. There is a nice balance between the metal and the orchestra stuff, with the former still being the main focus. If you are new to this band or the genre, I would say this is the definitive album, and is definitely a good starting point."
4,Symphony of Enchanted Lands,"Fantasy metal of such epic proportions even Tolkien himself would groove to it! This isn't based on a Tolkien story, though! These guys are very similar to Blind Guardian in both musical style and subject matter. The only big difference is that the guy that sings for Rhapsody has a cleaner voice. This CD is a must for power metal fans or Blind Guardian fans! This is an excellent, excellent CD!"
5,A trip through enchanted lands...and great virtuosity,"This is a great album.For all you who still believe that metal can have virtuosity,and the rare taste of a masterpiece that will live through time,then this is an album for you.The musical work surpasses all adjectives,while the vocals are heartfelt enough to give chills to anyone.The lyrics make us think on some kind of lost pride that mankind once had,and Luca Turilli tries to bring back again for all of us to feel it.The good and the evil face again,but love and positive feelings are going always to conquer evil.An album full of great music,great lyrics,great singing(too far from the hysteric yelling that some may suppose that metal singing must be),and great message."
4,Wow.,"This is a good CD, by a great band. All of these people posting that this is a bad CD, WTF is wrong with you? Get a life. You sit there and bash other people that like this kind of music. You don't hear me insulting you because you listen to death metal, which is nothing but an atrocity. It is a shameful waste. If you want some good music with real talent, this is the CD."
5,Memorable and moving,"This film goes through the commission, World War II, Korean War, Gulf War and decommission of the Mighty Mo. crew interviews and documentary footages take place by turns. Seldom-seen shots and rarely-told stories are included, which makes it even more memorable. The surrender signing of Japan may be the most historic event of the MO, and the reason to choose her is due to the Missouri-born President Harry Truman.The run time is about 2 hours and the bonus features share about 1 hour. I believe this film is the best to cover the Mighty MO so far, and probably forever. If you are a World War II or battleship fan, you should put this into your collections. In addition, if you are from Missouri, you should also at least watch it since it is quite moving to see a Missourian on the Missouri talking something about Missouri."
3,Too Pointy for Me,"I actually returned this boot. It's a nice boot. However, the toe was way too pointy for me."
3,"Wow, talk about hidden talent.","I found these artists on the Barb wire soundtrack, yeah I know not the best thing to say when arguing over good music, but there song on that album rocked. Getting by the cover and the fact that they actually made an appearance in the barb wire movie, they were the band on stage in barb's club, these girls and a guy get my vote for unsung talent. It is kind of like coffee, beer or cigarettes an acquired taste for only the creme de la creme of upper lower class society."
5,Smothered =),"This band caught my eye in the movie Barb Wire, they played their song called ""Pigskin Parade"" got stuck in my head for months and was looking around in different websites just to buy that one song, sadly I couldn't find or buy this song anywhere, not even iTunes had it, so I gave into temptation and brought the whole album which I'm happy I did because this whole album rocks! The sound is very 90's and original, its too bad this band broke apart after releasing one album because I would of loved to hear more from them."
1,blah....,"Ok the cover will get your attention, the makeup of the band will do the same and even the fact that Rollins produced it wil get it some fame, but the lyrics are absurd and childish and the music has no real direction."
4,Rock solid British bluesrock,"Really good late 60's heavy bluesrock that would appeal to fans of British bands like Savoy Brown and Fleetwood Mac. This has some occasional boogie elements as well as some slightly progressive elements in the same way the two mentioned bands did. Rod Price really tears it up on some of the songs (kind of reminding me of Jimmy Page in ""Death Valley Blues""). What an underrated guitar player he was, as he did some great stuff with Savoy Brown, and his work with Foghat was great as well.Anyways, this album is rock solid and recommended"
4,Exactly what I needed,"I used three of these clamps to attach my H-Lift Jack to the rack on my 4x4. I painted them flat black, and used wing nuts to secure the jack to the bolts."
3,The begining of real greatness,"This was the first album from English boy band ""East 17"". I have been a fan of the group all my life and although this is nowhere near their best work, it is still good and you can see where their later greatness comes from. Probably the best track on the album is ""Alright"", which it could be said is also one of their best songs ever and is one of my favorites. Other good tracks on the album include ""Deep"" and ""House of Love"". This only gets a 3/5 rating because most of the album lacks the real thought and meaningfulness that are evident in the later albums ""Up All Night"" and the magnificent ""Steam"". I would recommmend this to anyone who is a fan of the band or is interested in early 90's pop from the UK."
3,About average,"I am ususally a DK Eyewitness fan, but the Lonely Planet Stockholm was more recent in it's copywright. Most information was helpful except when heading to Gripsholms Slott, which wasn't open to any public until May, we visited in February.Also some of the stores noted for shopping in Galma Stad didn't exist."
3,Not so good.,"Another of DMP's Yaoi Manga, it's not like most Yaoi Manga having the teacher as the Uke and the student as the Seme. It wasn't necessarily DMP's fault for my low rating of this Yaoi Manga but it simply the fact was I disliked it. The art didn't catch me and neither did the story. So if you are a true Yaoi Fan get it but if you only collect the good stuff, pass by this one. After all, two of the main characters get girlfriends and that's not my cup of tea when I prefer reading boys boinking."
4,Suprisingly nice!,"I purchased this item a month ago. Due to the bad weather in New York the delivery was a bit delayed but suprisingly came within 2 weeks. The assembly was pretty much easy. Although, the holes weren't all properly arranged for the screws to go into it was not too big of a problem. The color is a great match and it looks really sleek. I am satisfied."
5,Hollow shaft; very convenient use over bolts,"Excellent case. Clasp will not break. Write your name with broad tip magic marker all over case for security. Selection includes two larger nut drivers (HS-16, HS-18) than often included in such kits."
4,As good as Let It Bee!,"I actually discovered this VOTB recording before Let It Bee, but I love them both! Just as cynical, just as catchy, 'Honey' offers more spicy than sweet, but that's what the group is good at! I must disagree with the reviewer who doesn't like ""Shooting Cupid"" and ""Say It"" - those are two of my favorite tracks! I remember thinking ""Cupid"" would have made a great un-Valentine music video from the group! Maybe I'm as cynical as the girls are on this, but I think they're right on target with that track! The songs go up and down from start to finish - fast and slow, ballads to pop, but always listenable and always with something to say. Even David Cassidy's ""I Think I Love You"" gets new life the way they belt it out! Always a pleasant diversion - very underrated!"
4,One of my favorite driving albums!,"Okay, first things first. The reviewer who called ""I Think I Love You"" an Osmonds tune obviously never watched ""The Partridge Family"". :-) Now that we've got that out of the way... I *adore* VOTB's version of that song - it rocks! I bought this album on tape soon after it came out, and recently I rediscovered it in my collection. I popped it in the tape deck of my car...and didn't take it out for a couple of weeks. I listened to it on the way to and from work every day and didn't get sick of it. ""Monsters and Angels"" is still a fantastic, fun song all these years later. I'd say besides that and ""I Think I Love You,"" probably my favorite is ""Just Like You"" - because it's fast and thumpy and especially for the wonderfully clever lyric ""It's just like you to leave me shakin in my go-go boots."" That just sums up the FUN these girls provide."
4,An almost-perfect confection that runs out of steam,"I was a huge fan of ""Let It Bee"" by VOTB, so I came to this one with a skeptical eye and ear attuned. Well, I was pleased to be (almost) completely wrong--""Honey Lingers"" is almost a perfect pop/rock album. The only drawback is that the band is so poppy, so smart, so wise, and so infectiously danceable (""Just Like You"" ""Adonis Blue"" ""Monsters and Angels"") for most of the album, and their take on male-female relationships is so acute, that when they go a-clunker with empty froth such as ""Cupid"" or ""Say It,"" one feels unreasonably betrayed. Still, there's more brains and heart here than can be found on a thousand Spice Girls albums, and for that we should cherish the Beehive girls."
5,"She's not your Sister anymore, Siobhan is Shakespears","I so miss Siobhan Fahey on this lp. And you can see that the hole left behind wasn't just a voice but a writer. There are several remakes and remixes that are very good, but I don't know if all of them would have been on ""Pop Life"" had Fahey stayed.But again, the songs (remakes or otherwise)& the vocals are very strong and they stay with you. 5 stars, though the 5th is flickering."
5,cant get enough of nana,"This is my 2nd fav. Bananarama album (my fav. is Ultra Violet). More fun, bouncy, catchy, and beautifully harmonious songs that the girls are wonderful at creating. My favorite songs are Preacher Man, Tripping on your Love, Aint no Cure, and Only your Love, and Heartless."
2,Yawn,"I wonder if I read the same book as the first reviewer here? Couldn't have.The book I read alternated between being boring and self-consciously ""avante-garde."" In defense of Mr. Southern, this is very much a first novel. Lots of characters, lots of plot and. . .it all goes nowhere. The characters, all of them, are selfish, self-serving neurotic a-holes. It was impossible to feel anything for them. Only the Latino gardener character was anything resembling human.If you're new to Southern's writing, skip this effort and go right to THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN---so much a superior book, it's hard to believe it was written by the same guy. For what it's worth, in the fine Southern biography, A GRAND GUY, it's noted that Allen Ginsberg couldn't make heads or tails of FLASH AND FILIGREE either."
5,"Seek it out, it is brilliant","Flash and Filigree is Southern at his very late-50s best,and is the only work that can stand together with TheMagic Christian. If you can forgive the dated anddiscomforting date-rape chapter, the rest of the bookwill have you alternately courting hernia from excessivelaughter and horror from Southern's bizarre juxtapositions.Where else can one find a therapist who coldcocks hispatients with a heavy glass ashtray ?"
4,Yet another TS classic,"Warped sense of humor, bizarre story line, great story telling. It's Terry Southern...what more needs to be said? What's REALLY wild about it is that this is his first novel, yet could have been anywhere along the chain. it's just pure TS."
1,Flash and Filigree is a bad novel.,"I slogged through it only because Terry Southen has written some of the best books I have ever read. The Magic Christian and Candy are wonderful works of satire, so I kept thinking ""This has to get better."" It did not. The character's thoughts and motivations were wierd, overly complicated (as oppposed to Complex) and out of sinc with what was going on or at least just plain stupid It's hard to see the same author behind this one. Maybe it is because it was his first novel. I felt it was written by someone who is highly intelligent but completely lacking in esthetic judgement."
4,JIMIS EARLY DAYS,THE SONGS ON THIS CD GO FAR BACK AS 65_66 WHEN JIMI WAS PLAYING WITH LONNIE YOUNG BLOOD AND SOME EVEN APPEAR ON THEHARD TO GET PPX RECORDINGS ONLY AVABLE AS AN IMPORT OVER ALL THIS IS JIMI WHEN HE PLAYED WITH THE ISLEY BROTHRS .AND LITTLE RICHARD.
2,Decent but not great,It's funny I'm writing this review even though I bought this camera maybe 8 years ago.At the time is was good. 1.2MP! Can't beat a 1.2MP camera these days!... oh wait... nevermind.Buy a newer one.
5,Gadget Guy,"This camera is a lot of fun! It's my first digital camera and I found it easy to get started taking pics. You do need to read the instruction manual if you want to do more than just basic picture taking. But in just a few minutes you can get going. Definitely get the flashpath adapter (it'll save a lot of time downloading pics to your PC). The panaramic ""stitching"" program that comes with it is really cool."
5,just got it,Just picked up my oly yesterday and already have taken about a dozen pics and emailed some and reprinted some. I am a true novice when it comes to cameras so for me to get that far that soon is saying something about this user friendly camera.I also bought the smart media writer which is really cool. Rechargable batteries are a must. Happy so far.
5,THE BEST FOR TWICE THE $$$$$$$,"THE D450 IS MY SECOND DIGITAL CAMERA. MY FIRST WAS THE D200L WHICH I STILL USE IS NOW 4 YEARS OLD. I ALMOST BOUGHT THE C2000Z UNTIL I SAW THE 450 , UNLESS YOU ARE SHOOTING PICS FROM 300 FEET AWAY WHO NEEDS A 2 MEGAPIXLE CAMERA OR THE GIANT FILE THAT IT CREATES. THE 3 LANGUAGE MANUAL NEEDS TO GO (HERE ME OLYMPUS ! ) IF YOU PLAN ON PRINTING PICS , I HAVE AN HP970 WHICH DOES THE BEST JOB I HAVE SEEN ANYWHERE, IF YOU HAVE A XXXXX PRINTER I AM VERY SORRY... I GAVE AWAY 3 XXXXXX (A 610 & 2 5000'S - SLOW IS ONLY GOOD FOR KETCHUP) GET A USB CARD READER-- VERY FAST-- ONLY WAY TO GO-- & A 32 MB CARD & 3 OR 4 SETS OF NICADS, YES NICADS- MUCH CHEAPER. I AM STILL USING 2 SETS THAT ARE LEFT OVER FROM THE D200 THAT ARE AT LEAST 2 YEARS OLD. I HAVE RECHARGED THE BATTRIES ONCE A WEEK OR MORE FOR OVER 2 YEARS & TAKEN THOUSANDS OF PICTURES WITH THEM. LOOK TO SPEND ABOUT $250.00 ON TOP OF THE CAMERA WITH THE BATTS, 32MB CARD & USB READER."
4,Good Olives,I enjoyed these olives and when one package actually arrived here leaking and partially open Amazon promtply replaced the ENTIRE order. This is PREMIUM customer service in my book and greatly appreciated. I find so little customer service exists in the retail stores that I plan to buy Amazon where possible based on their high service level. I suggest other purchasers consider Amazon as well.
3,Soft and attractive towels,Towels arrived quickly. Fair price for soft product. Towels must be washed a couple of times before use to avoid drying yourself into a full fuzz body suit.
3,Good examples pertaining to public administration.,"This text provides good examples of statistical problems pertaining to public administration. However, the text does not do a good job in explaining how to use certain statistical tools to solve problems(e.g. chi-square). In addition, some of the statistical tables are confusing for students."
2,Rip off!,"At one hundred fifty dollars this book is a total rip. It's softcover for chrissakes, and boring! You can get the international edition for less (I paid forty one dollars)."
5,excellent,"fresh product, really does wonders for the skin and hair, also helps the arteries stay elastic and allows them to dilate with less stress. it's also a great source of fiber although its not listed on the bottle, it is and so Apple Pectin is also a good way to block carb absorption."
4,Nice Material; Not for Speedy Deployment,"The RadTech Sleevz is designed for the aesthetic nuts, which most buyers of the macbook pro would be.It does the job described in the product site: the fabric is fantastic, stretches well, useful for wiping dust off.It also looks downright cool compared with other sleeves in the market.The drawbacks of the product are also already well-known.1. It's not that easy to deploy, unless you are highly proficient at slipping on tight fitting covers (for reasons that perhaps no one else should ever need to know).2. There is an opening (duh), so it's by no means full protection from all 6 directions.3. The thin cover does not protect against the school of hard knocks; just against scratches.Pretty satisfied with the product overall since I knew exactly what i was buying into."
3,Good Plot -- Not Suspenseful,This was my first Goddard book and I was pleased with the excellent plot and how he weaves the characters together. Is a tad bit dry and loses the supsense because the book starts out in current time and the rest is flashbacks until the end. Too many flashbacks used as well -- you find yourself having to organize yourself. A family tree would have helped too so that you can keep all the characters straight.
4,"Goddard is outstanding but, ""Beyond Recall"" not his best","""Beyond Recall"" is a well crafted story with a solid plot line. Goddard has chosen to use more flash-backs than usual. I don't like flash-backs but these are so well written they are not objectionable. For some reason this book never grabbed a hold of me like most of Goddards books. The book is a good read but does not rate 5 stars."
2,Mystery for Beginners With Nothing To Do,"Harsh, yes. Honest, very. I read the prior reviews and then bought the book anxious to find another great author. What I found was boredom and frustration, some red herrings, and a mystery not worth my time. The characters weren't in depth enough to feel for them, the forward in time back in time movement didn't work for keeping the story moving, and the story itself didn't hold my attention. I finished because I felt committed."
2,No sting,"I admit it -- I never of Merritt before 69 Love Songs, but now I know why. The incredible songwriting and humor of Love Songs came out of nowhere -- there's nothing on this record that would even hint at it. The songs here are mostly flat, the singing incredibly tame and insipid for a bunch of ""indie"" heroes. Barbara Manning, e.g., should be recording children's albums. Three or four songs are somewhat memorable, but this is strictly for diehard fans."
2,bland,I liked:2:Aging Spinsters6:Pillow Fight13:Puerto Rico Waythe rest sounded a bit bland. The song lengths are not to long which is good because even if these songs were any longer they would start to be boring.
5,undiscovered country,"As a virtual newcomer to Stephen Merritt, I was suprised that something I heard on a commercial radio station with links to an online music sales site would actually throw up something this great, but I now own all of his and The 6ths' backlist. It's pop genius, flaws and all.Aging Spinster is the most insidious song on the album. It's like a lamprey with it's hook and arrogant swagger. In the City In The Rain likewise, with the vocals just tickling the ear, and Falling Out of Love is my favourite with it's morbid excellence.Two thumbs up people. Should appeal to fans of Balck Box Recorder and The Postal Service."
4,Highway 405 will take you...,"Stephin Merritt must really irritate all those other musicians who claim to be ""in search of the perfect pop song."" He writes them regularly!"
4,Lush synth-pop with hipper-than-hip vocal support.,"Pop Kulcher Review: Stephin Merritt writes sensitive pop-poetry, and his band, the Magnetic Fields, has put out some albums of melodic ditties with lovelorn lyrics and lo-fi (primarily synthesizer-driven) instrumentation. But far better is this one-shot effort as The 6ths (the band name & album title were chosen as a tongue-twister: try saying it out loud), in which Merritt turns over vocal duties to a Who's Who of alternative rock heroes (including Dean Wareham of Luna, Lou Barlow of Sebadoh, Mac McCaughan of Superchunk, Georgia Hubley of Yo La Tengo, Robert Scott of the Bats, Mitch Easter, Barbara Manning, etc.). So the album manages to sound a bit like a cover-song compilation, with Merritt's sweet melodies, quiet keyboards and guitars, and simple but moving lyrics being the constants holding the whole thing together. It's a lush treat that should not be missed."
4,No. 1!!!,This book was so easy to read. You come to love Precious. Every case is different! It lets you see into present-day Africa. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to reading all the others!
4,a pleasingly relaxed mystery,"This book is reminiscent to me of Tony Hillerman's books, in that we are taken into the lives of a different type of people with their own way of dealing with a different kind of lifestyle that we are not familiar with, only instead of the four-corner area of the southwest, we are in Botswana, Africa. The story is not one of a thriller packed with action, but of a No.1 lady detective (the only one) who is approached by various customers to look into mundane to serious cases in her area. It is a relaxing, funny, sad and thought provoking book. It gives the reader a look at life in Botswana that is entertaing and informative and leaves you wanting to learn more. There aren't many fiction books on life in Africa that is available to the average citizen that is this enjoyable. You have a relaxed, good feeling when you finish the book."
4,Great beach read,"It ain't great literature, but nobody promised it was, and besides, it's a great beach read, and you learn quite a bit about Botswana in the bargain.Premise is that a woman sets up a one-lady detective agency, not only the #1 agency of its kind, but the ONLY agency of its kind. Written as a series of vignettes focusing on the cases that come along, the author explores and enlightens her readers at a leisurely pace, which is just perfect for sitting on the warm sand and glancing up every now and then to check on the children playing at water's edge.Written with wit and wisdom, this is a book to be read, savored, and then passed on to a friend."
2,"Disappointing, a bit condescending","I'm not sure why this book got such raving reviews, I certainly don't need to go on and read book 2 in the series. Perhaps it is because I listened to the audio version, but I found the tone of the writing condescending toward the culture the author is supposed to represent. Moreover, the main character is hardly compelling, and the unfolding events during the story perilously close to being simply boring."
5,"lovely, generous storytelling","This book was a wonderful surprise. I had heard of neither it nor its author before, but once I started reading the book, I could not put it down. I was charmed by its heroine, the wise and traditionally built Precious Ramatswe. The gentle, humorous, and lively depiction of Mma Ramatswe's life, friends, and family in Botswana pulled me in. The book is generous and forgiving in its view of human nature and human relationships. It also conveys a love of the land of Africa, and pride in the nation of Botswana. This served to remind me that human beings consist not only of their feelings, thoughts, and relationships (which are so easy to get caught up in), but also their national identities and ties to their homelands. We are individuals, and also members of a society."
3,A disappointment for me,"Our book group read this book because many of us had heard from other people that this series was really good. I have to say that I found this book a little boring. It's not really an ongoing plot but, instead, a series of short stories. The solutions to the ""crimes"" come about by the most unrealistic coincidences and situations. If solving cases were this easy there wouldn't be any criminals out on the streets. One gal in our book group bought the series based on recommendations and after reading the first book gave the rest of the set to one of the ladies who liked the book. I would say our book group consensus tallied at about 80% who didn't care for the book and 20% who did."
4,"Easy, pleasant read","With beautiful writing and great settings, this wonderful Alex McCall Smith book will surely become one of your favorites. Taut, psychologically suspenseful, and brilliantly constructed like McCrae's ""The Bark of the Dogwood"" or some of Hemingway's works (though those are of an entirely different subject matter),this tour-de-force will have you wanting to tackle the other books in the series. Highly recommended."
2,Un-developed,"I read this in my book club; otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it. The book never gets too involved in any one story. There are many cases Precious solves, too many. I was interested in the case of the missing boy and kept waiting for that to be developed. It wound up being anti-climactic. As I read it, I thought, this is it? I did enjoy Precious life story, and how she got to own her own agency. Some of the writing is very beautiful. Other members of my book club, said the other books are much better. Sadly, I'm not interested enough to find out. As for women detectives, I LOVED Maisie Dobbs by J. Winspear"
2,Disappointed,"Having read so many glowing reviews, I picked this book up and promptly signed my name in it. When I was done - I wished I hadn't written in it, so that I could return it!!! I found this book slow moving, trite and uninspiring. Maybe if I had more knowledge of Africa and the every day slang used there, I would have become more involved in the stories. I'd say if you want a book to read that's ""just a book to read"", and not something you become immersed in, then this book would be ok."
2,It was Okay,"This book was okay, not one of my favorites. Probably won't buy anymore. Only read it because it was my Book Club pick, but wouldn't buy another one."
2,I Don't Get It,"I decided to read this book for a couple of reasons: My wife had heard a lot of good things about it and I normally love books about Africa or set in Africa as I have spent quite a bit of time there.Unfortunately what I found in this book was a poorly written, boring story with no plot. I certainly don't get what so many people seem to see in this book. Wilbur Smith it is not.I certainly don't recommend it."
3,pleasant story,I enjoyed getting to know the characters in an African setting. The main character is a strong character created in a gentle manner.
2,Expecting More,"I was expecting an exciting mystery so I was somewhat disappointed with this book. The main character is an African lady thay has had some hardship in her life but she remains upbeat. She loves her Africa and in that vein, she introduces us to her Africa. That I did enjoy. The author's imagery is quite good. I guess the cases she receives are typical of Africa; but they lack any real mystery or excitement. Her approach to them is rather homey. If you would like to be introduced to Africa in a different way, then you will like this book."
5,"Enchanting, Entertaining, pure Enjoyment","I purchased this book for two reasons: First, it was highly recommended; second, I will be traveling to Botswanna soon and wanted to read something set in that country. I was immediately drawn into the story and felt as if I was watching the story come to life as I was transported from my sofa to Gabarone. I couldn't wait to read the rest of the series."
5,ladies detective,Nice slow pace. Very relaxing and entertaining. Different from the usual mystery in many ways.
4,Contemporary Botswana,"This is the first book of the widely acclaimed series featuring Botswana's Precious Ramotswe and her tiny detective service. Although it is not technically an historical mystery, to us it seems timeless and has value in its presentation of a slow paced, dignified side of African life that is often overlooked. Precious' rare combination of refinement and ingenuity more than once helps her solve problems both big and small. Her understanding of certain situations as a female of a certain age holds her in good stead as well."
1,"Okay, so I really prefer thrillers.","Call me simple, but I couldn't get through the first tape of the unabridged audio book. I tried to be patient, but after an hour, the plot still hadn't begun to take shape. Although I can't offer much in the way of a review, I nonetheless felt the need to post one, because I bought this book BECAUSE of the rave reviews. It may warm up, but all indications pointed to ramblings of cultures and complications in simple lives, and I was absolutely bored to death. The slow speech and accent of the reader may have contributed to the coma this book attempted to put me in."
1,Review on cover of book is a lie!,"This is the first time in my life where I have bought a book, based on the printed reviews, and found them to be totally misleading!I am VERY displeased. The review on the cover of this book was definitely misleading. There was not one hilarious or even mildly funny episode in the ENTIRE book. I unfortunately kept reading it until the very end, thinking it has to get better. Where's all the funny stuff!!It was not written well. The story did not flow well. It is nothing but short stories about a few investigations and then WAH--LA she decides its time to get married...the end. This has to be the worst book I have ever read!I am really sorry I forked out my twelve bucks at an airport bookstore for this one."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!,This book was very slow moving and lacked the ability to hold my interest. I'd recommend the Poisonwood Bible instead.
3,Something different,"This is an interesting novel, but I have to agree with some other reviewers that the writing is not up to the level of other PI fiction, e.g., novels by Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, etc. I would note that that author has previously writen children's books, and the writing style may reflect that. The plotting is somewhat simplistic.Having said that, the characters are interesting, and the novel provides substantial information about Botswana where the author lived for a period of time. The novel covers a number of cases, and the interesting ones are towards the end (insurance fraud, people's identities, and a missing child).I thought it was worth reading, but if you are used to the complexities of American PI novels you might be disappointed."
2,A somewhat laborious read,"I wanted to read this book because of the positive reviews it had received. The book was hard for me to get into. I wanted the mystery to present itself sooner than it did. Too much time was spent on the main character's history, which I suppose was to set up the series. When she finally got a case, it was resolved very quickly. I realized that this book would describe several simple, quick cases she had worked on rather than having a main mystery that would serve as a plot. It was interesting to have Africa as a backdrop, but that is not enough to make me want to read other books in this series, the first book of which disappointed me."
1,Couldn't finish.,"I really tried to like this as I knew someone who thought it was great. Unfortunately, I could never get into it. I must have read half the book before I finally just gave up and gave the book away."
4,I enjoyed it greatly,"Congratulations to Ms Smith. A fun read. Reminded me of my own Beauford Sloan Mystery series.Raymond AustinTelevision director of The Saint, The Avengers, Hawaii Five-O, Magnum, P.I., Hart to Hart, Jag, etc.And author of ""The Eagle Heist"" and ""Dead Again"""
3,Watch Out Ms. Christie,I found this book enchanting. Mma Ramotswe is both likable and hilarious as the lead character running her own detective agency in Botswana. She encounters many interesting sorts and solves their mysteries along the way.Alexander McCall writes with an easy style that encourages his readers to read a little longer. His chapters could easily be a short story within themselves. I was so wrapped up in his book that I read it in two days and am currently on to the next in his series about Mma Ramotswe. I see a movie in the future!!
2,charming from start to finish,Mna Ramotswe is the most colorful character to grace the pages in a long time. Her wonderful vivid accounts of Africa and its people are splendid and warm. I discovered her quite by accident and can hardly wait to find our her next excellant adventure. The audio books are a wonderful way to immerse yourself from the stresses of a busy day or a wonderful companion on a piece of exercise equipment. I hope you will enjoy the No 1. Ladies Detective agency adventures as much as I have.
5,Cute Book!,"I love this series of books. It is adorable, endearing and fun. This one is as good as the others, thus far. It arrived in good condition as well."
5,Humanity and lightness of touch,"I have read all the books in this series and really enjoyed them. One of the things I love about this author, in everything he writes, is that he can explore real issues and write a thoughtful, meaningful book without all the pretentiousness, downbeat elements and consciously elevated writing that so many ""literary"" writers seem to go for. This is a real soap-box issue for me. Sometimes I like a really escapist read, but sometimes I want a book that makes me think, yet does this have to mean I must plough through all this dense writing and catatonic characters who are so alienated and never seem to behave like normal human beings? Surely not! Alexander McCall Smith has a wonderful humanity and lightness of touch. I recommend his work to anyone who is looking for that kind of in-between read - life-affirming and thought-provoking without being a chore to wade through."
4,Wonderful start to one of the best series ever!,"The only thing I didn't like was that it had to end.I learned that you don't have to write elloquently to write a book. This book was so simple and yet so enjoyable that it makes me wonder if I really could write a book too.Because each mystery/case is so short and precise, it doesn't need all the suspense other books use. I think the suspense in this book is about finding out what the next problem will be and how clever she is to solve it.One question asked in book club was if women are more perceptive than men. I don't feel that all women are more perceptive than all men. It depends on personality. However, I would venture to generalize that many women seem to be more sensitive to other people's feelings than most men are."
3,Not Worth Lining Up to Get Your Copy,I've been hearing about this book for a long time. People speak about it in glowing terms. So........when I picked it up to read I expected something grand and wonderful. what I discovered was a cute series of vignettes about a chubby Botswanan detective who solves puzzles and some criminal activities. The writing is just okay and the subject matter just barely managed to hold my interest. I thought the book would be better marketed for young adults rather than for mature adults.I can't understand why the book is such a sensation and why a whole TV series has been made about it. I think I am drawn to more intense and darker books. I certainly prefer books with better narratives and a finer style of writing.
3,"A good story, in the end","Described as a ""series of vignettes,"" The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency uses a non-linear narrative style which at times makes you wonder what one chapter has to do with anything else. Mma Ramotswe, the main character, is a clever woman who is always minding everyone else's business. Her antics and interactions entertain but the writing style doesn't really ""set the hook."" In the end, it all comes together. I enjoyed the story once it was complete, but not always so much along the way."
4,Schrewd sleuth from Batswana,"When Precious Ramotswe's father dies and leaves her an inheritance, she uses it to buy a house and to start a detective agency. Business is slow at first, but as her reputation for solving difficult cases continues to spread, Precious begins to have more cases. The author depicts his heroine as a wise woman whose intuition leads her to creative solutions to the puzzles posed to her by clients. Whether it's tracking down a cheating husband or pursuing a witch doctor to rescue a kidnapped boy, Precious uses creative, yet straight-forward methods to solve her cases. This is a charming series which entertains and also informs the reader about a culture which is unfamiliar to many Americans."
3,"A simple read, with no mystery about it","This was an easy read, and a simple story to follow. Some of the imagery in the book was just beautiful. However, it didn't really have much of a 'flow'...by this I mean, each chapter seemed like an anecdote or short story unto itself, that had many of the same characters. And I certainly wouldn't classify this as a mystery (that is what the back cover had it categorized as)...there wasn't much in the way of thrilling or 'whodunnit' action! All in all, an okay read. Glad I read it, but I feel no compulsion to continue reading the rest of this series."
4,African traditions and landscapes,"Precious Ramotswe had a short nightmarish marriage to Note Mokoti and gave birth to a child who lived only five days. For the next fourteen years she stayed with her father until his death when she was thirty four. Luckily he left her well off so she set up a detective agency.The rest of the book deals with the cases she handled and how she handled them. Many of the stories were very interesting but there were some weak ones too. For example the case of Malatsi who disappeared in the river, when he was about to be baptized. How did Mma Ramotswe know that he was eaten by a crocodile and above all how to position herself in a place and time for the crocodile?!! After killing the animal she slit open its belly and found undigested bangles and rings and a wristwatch and so solved the case. Sorry, to me this was weak.The author captures some of the nuances very well indeed and I liked how the book ends on a pleasantly romantic note."
4,Great Series!,"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books are great! They read quickly, and they are an excellent way to escape to a far away place without too much effort! Although the first book features a number of smaller cases, Tears of the Giraffe (book 2) and Morality for Beautiful Girls (book 3) focus on larger cases that aren't solved as quickly, easily keeping your interest for the length of the book.It isn't necessary to read the books in order, either. The author does a great job of filling in pertinent details as he goes. I would recommend reading the No. 1 Ladies Detective before reading the other books though. Important details about Mma Ramotswe's life are disclosed in the book, and those events are often referred to later in the series."
2,Simple...Charming...nothing else.,"After all of the hype, I had to read this. I was very disappointed. I suppose I was expecting too much. It's a light, comfortable, easy read I would feel good about putting in my child's (teen) room for the summer or taking to the beach for something quick. However, it was too light for me. No plot, short, poor dialog, very little depth to the characters. The author would start to touch on the charm of Africa, then simply abandon it in search of a story that never seemed to take hold.I am pleased to have met the charming main character, however found I could have put the book down at any time without feeling the loss. I won't be looking to read the rest in series. This was pleasant....but once is enough."
4,Mma Ramotswe is Worthy and Wise and An Enjoyable Storyteller,"If you find yourself needing a little uplifting relaxation and a fun read, pick up a copy of Alexander McCall Smith's The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, the first book in the overwhelmingly series. A perfect break from an overdose of too many noir crime novels!The story tells how Mma (aka Precious) Ramotswe struggles to get the only detective agency run by a woman in Botswana off the ground. Smith, a native of Zimbabwe, intermixes several story strands, including Mma Ramotswe's back story. She deftly solves mysteries large and small without violence or high-tech equipment. Smith uses the stories to take the reader to a little bit of southern Africa.A very enjoyable read. Often compared to Agatha Christie with some justification, Mma Ramotswe is a worthy and wise fictional character in her own right. She narrates her own tales with a delightful light and commonsensical tone. Highly recommended."
5,The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,I fell in love with Precious Romatswe and her beloved Botswana. Mr. McCall's prose is a wonderful blend of humor and wisdom.
4,"Great read,","This book is a great read and a great escape from the usual, predictable novel. This was a Christmas gift from a friend in Scotland and I thanked her for introducing me to a new author.I have ordered the following 3 books and plan to savor them."
4,Pleasant easy read,"I enjoyed this book because it was a light hearted change of pace from the darker more dramatic books I have been reading as of late. It was fun and well paced. It was easy to put down and pick right back up again, which is especially important if you are a mother of small children and have to steal away to read in small moments.I agree that there were some editorial errors as mentioned in other reviews, but I found them easy to recognize and move on. The errors didn't really deter that much from the story or, more importantly, the place the story takes the reader.After finishing the book in no time at all, I found myself eager to buy the sequels. I would recommend this book simply for the wonderful whit and observation of Mma. Romatswe and the simplicity of reading a good old fashioned detective novel."
2,Atypical mystery novel,"I was looking for something more like an Agatha Christie or M.M. Kaye when I picked up this book. In contrast to those books, this had little-to-no suspense. The characters are warm and the setting is interesting, but the book reads more like a series of short stories about Botswana and its people rather than a mystery. In themes, it's sort of a cross between ""The Color Purple"" and a Harlem-renaissance book called ""The Conjure-Man Dies"", but much less interesting than both. I finished the book, there were some amusing vignettes, but overall it leaves much to be desired."
