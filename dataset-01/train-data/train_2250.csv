4,Nice work,"This DVD is explaining things better than the previous version, where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc.Some of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained. The crytal-photography on water meditated upon by the Japanese monk was especially awesome.They have tried their best to explain stuff that cant be easily explained by the western(modern)science .... ofcourse.....it ends in letting you ponder....they have left most of it there. There after one has to go into religion and spirituality - particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the ""Sanathana Dharma"" teachings."
4,Enlightening,"If you are in need of some elightening; this vido is wonderful. If you are going through a period (loss, pain, upheaval in life-and you have a relatively open mind) this movie will change your life."
5,What the Bleep do we know?,"I loved this movie, I have viewed it 3 times, and I have an order in to purchase 2 when it becomes available.This movie has so many answers to how I get what I get in my life. The ideas packed in What The Bleep Do We Know, showed me how much power I really do have, and that the possibilities for me to create my life how I want-- are endless."
5,Best Introduction to Manifestation Thinking,"Whether you hate or love ""new age"" ideas and the notion of creating your reality, this film is powerful and intriguing. I love the way there are snippets of scientists talking about the ideas of manifestation throughout a regular story... the story is what holds our attention, and the ideas along the way provide the background for seeing the world in a whole new way.""What the Bleep"" is a landmark in cinematography that will be viewed as a milestone for years to come... as it encourages viewers to talk about new ideas and come up with their own insights. It's truly a must-see movie!"
5,Rompiendo paradigmas,"Ojalá las ciencias fueran presentadas así en el colegio, seguro habría escogido una carrera en Química o Física.Excelente, retador, polémico, tiene todo lo necesario para ser una película excelente sin ser en si misma una película. La versión extendida es impresionante, se agradecen las ampliaciones a diferentes conceptos. Las entrevistas completas a los expertos son un gran acierto.Ojalá y no caigan en la trampa de convertirse en una pseudo-secta de la nueva era o en mercantilizar la teoría cuántica aprovechándose de la sorpresa de la gente."
1,Defective DVD from Amazon,I bought this DVD from AMAZON over 60 days ago so it is over the return policy date. It was a birthday present and I it bought early. I sent the item. It was returned to me becuase the DVD was defective. The picture ran but there was no audio. I have just emailed Amazon my request for a refund. I do not know if they will refund it or not. I am listing this not as a complaint but to state that I was given a defective DVD.
3,Too Much Of A Good Thing,"I bought the most expensive version of ""What the Bleep...Down the Rabbit Hole"",for having seen this presentation previously,I was anxious to have it in my collection.It had literally changed my thought processes in a profound way.I ordered the Quantum Edition with the hope of getting the maximum coverage of the theme,only to find that there is much repeating of footage on all three discs. By buying the single disc I doubt I'd have missed any of the essence of the theme, and could have saved a considerable amount as well.I recommend ""What the Bleep..."" to anyone pondering their existence in the universe,and their relationship to the immediate world around them."
1,It does not help when you can't view it in your country,"Amazon needs to make it more visible that your DVDs are not for all area codes - we ordered them, got them and tried to play them only to find it can't be viewed in all countries. Area code 1 for USA and could not be viewed in South Africa which is area code 2.Very disappointing when you finally get the package only to have to send it back."
5,What a Bleep do we know,Very good movie. Science and spirituality come together in this movie. Excelent.
5,Very enlightening...,"Powerful movie, reccomended it to all of my friends. The Truth doesn't change no matter how many self-help or spiritual books you read. This one is pretty much all you need but for another view of the same subject watch The Elegant Universe put out by NOVA."
2,swing and a miss,"I had read a lot of books about the subjects covered in this movie, so i was looking forward to seeing it. It was aweful. They simplified some very difficult concepts pretty well, hence the 2 stars. The little excerpts of non-documentary 'film' with Marlee Matlin were odd, disjointed, out of place, and seemed more like an acid trip than an explanation of the points being made, very distracting. They have some great minds explaining some great concepts, but then they get 'spiritual', and the movie starts to drift. The woman speaker who is supposedly channeling the spirit of Ramanatha is particularly wierd. Wait for this to come on the Science Channel, or you'll be out $15."
2,too sci-fi for me..,i got this dvd thinking it would have interesting and factual information quantum dynamics and it was really interesting in the first 15 minutes or so. Then all of a sudden the focus shifted to what could all of this science mean. people were then being interviewed who had no titles or references to support this new focus of extraordinary and paranormal abilities such as looking into the future and how the brain can subconsciously predict what is going to happen and how snow cystals can take the shape based on karma or good/bad feelings. i could not finish this dvd. i felt cheated and duped into watching someone's speculative and subjective thoughts on a subject i thought was going to be educating and factual. the dvd is based on the 'what if' part or 'wouldn't it be cool if..' premise about the 'wonders' of science. you'd have to be extremely open minded to think any of this were true. get this movie if you're into sci-fi books/flicks and want to learn about a fictional world.
1,Bunch of baloney,"First of all people should know that one of the key people behind this is the woman who call herself ""Ramtha"" who claims to channel and ancient warrior from thousands of years ago. Yeah. Secondly this work is a disjointed mess. Read the ""Tao of Physics"" and the ""Universe in a single atom""."
2,Nice try,"I purchased this DVD after reading some great reviews, but was quite disappointed. The group of people speaking here seems to be gathered randomly, rather than by their background and reputation in scientific and alt.scientific circles. Although they express some interesting thoughts, too much of the DVD contents is really nothing more than pseudo-science. Scientific concepts seem to be twisted and abused in some way to make it look and sound like science. If the idea was to question some age old scientific concepts and open doors to the new age of science, I would call it a nice try, but not more than that. Anyway, you should see it and decide for yourself. To me, this film is way overrated."
2,I Will Tell You!,"I know this: This movie is ridiculous. Bessie and some of her rotund friends from the Big Movie Watchers Club insisted that I watch this ""film"". I would be ""enlightened"" and learn to love science and mysticism and some wackiness about a global conscience. Well, clearly these cows have no conscience or they wouldn't have insisted I waste 90 minutes of my precious life on this nonsense. If I'd had about 73 more adult beverages I might have been better able to understand all the gibberish put forth in this thrilling film. Unfortunately, I left convinced of something I didn't need convincing of: There are a lot of moonbats in this world who'll buy into just about anything. Never again. HHD>"
1,Kick the Bucket! Junk!,"This movie is pure bogus. Unscientific ad hoc hypothesis. Metaphysics in the weak sense of the definition.You should buy this movie if you:- Are a grass eating hippy- Study stupid people- Like to ""waste"" time- Use LSDTo be making fun of this movie would be like pooping on poop!"
1,What the Bleep Do We Know,"Unfortunately this DVD cannot be viewed with a normalDVD-machine in Europe.I was very sorry having paid the price of the DVD plus shippingand not being able to view the film.Whenever a product is limited to wieving in America only, it ought to be noted on the product."
5,Best Mind Expanding Movie,"This is a great experience for those who are curious about other dimensions. Remember, there was once a belief that the world was flat and that was a perception, not a reality. This movie will move your mind to other possibilities, other realities, your choice."
3,What the Bleep,"I thought it was very interesting, and, will look forward to watching it again, to learn more. I was lost at times."
5,Love it!,Great movie! Loved the way it was presented and the science behind this. Would recommend this and have to my friends!
5,Must watch for progressive minds !,This is one of those rare Dvd's that I can watch every so often and gain additional insight into myself and the world around me.I normally do not buy dvd's because they have no replay value to me.This is different.
3,Mediocre,Many of my friends had raved about this movie. I felt it was disjointed (as it apparently was meant to be) and got nothing out of it except boredom.
1,Double ARRRGH,This is really a cotton candy version of anything relating to quantum physics or spirituality
3,What the *@$^#!,"This was a horribly trite film. Yet many of the interviewed experts were thought-provoking. Knight (the now-pudgy blonde) simply asserted one absurd thing after another. Annoying. All things considered, this would make a good discussion video for those interested in getting at what the bleep is floating around the majority of Americans' heads (which is, incidentally [if the film is any indication], not a whole lot). In short, the film lacks logic.Quantum physics simply confirms what theists have known all along - that creative freedom on the part of God's creation is neither incompatible with Providence nor is it kicking against the goads, it is our responsibility."
2,Random,"I found this documentary very interesting, however, can someone explain to me the random sexist rant in the middle of the film, where they justified men cheating on thier wives as quantum physics? Did this belong in the film, honestly? It was very offensive, biased and ignored women's sexuality."
1,What the Bleep Do We Know,Amazing and fascinating. I have watched it three times and each time I get more out of it. A new look at reality.
1,Not like the movie in the theatre!!!,I was very disapointed that this is not the same movie that was in the theatre. I bought two copies and gave one to a friend for Christmas and I am sure she thinks I am crazy. It is extremely confusing and the DVD has two sides but you would have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to watch this movie.
2,What the bleep is this train wreck?,"What a disaster. I don't even know what category this movie(?) would fit, maybe New Age Sex Fluff? It was hard to take whatever message the movie included seriously because of all the sex going on.The quotes from the movie participants at the end say it all:""If you don't leave feeling a bit wacko, you haven't learned a thing."" Oh boy. I actually (re)learned a couple things from this movie like, if you don't consider the possibilities it won't happen. If I didn't learn anything, my rating would have been one star.And then finally ""how far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?"" What does this mean?Awful."
3,More than what I needed,Interesting but it was too complicated for my adult students and it did not hold their attention very long. I will not use it in the future.
1,I'll tell you what the bleep we know.,"We know better than to fall for thinly veiled astrology, that's what the bleep we know. When I hear that a film is about quantum mechanics, then find out later that it stars Ramtha the magic faith healer (who by the way failed to heal her late husband's HIV infection), I get very disappointed. It gets one star only because no stars is not an option."
5,Life Changing Documentary/Movie,"This movie was life changing for me. I actually first viewed it on one of the premium paid movie channels and then rented it several times from the library. It is one of those movies you need to watch several times and each time get something new from it. I am not one to purchase movies, I think I have only purchased two in my lifetime and the other was a VHS. When I got my tax return it was on my list of things I had to have. I hope others get as much out of it as I, but to each their own. You really need to be an open minded person who either has a positive personality or is looking to have one. If you really want the answers to some of life's big questions than this is your movie. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
1,A sham of false claims and out-of-context speech bits to trick people into thinking this collection of wishful thinking is real.,"It's no better than when Limbaugh does the same thing, and the producers of this film should be as ashamed of themselves as Rush should be of himself. Fraud or self-delusion? Probably both."
1,"Terrible, whether you're new or not to this stuff.","This ""movie"" is terrible. I realise it wasn't made as a real movie and more of a quasi-docudrama type thing, but the ""docu"" and ""drama"" are both awful. There's some good scientists who have some great thoughts about quantum reality, but while watching this I felt like without having read numerous books on the subject, I would hardly have known what they were talking about. And, since I _am_ well educated on this topic, I felt like this movie added nothing.It's geared towards newcomers to the topic, but it fails. Look around on Amazon for highly rated intro-to-quantum-theory books if you're interested in the subject, don't buy this.This had potential, but it's just horribly flawed by bad acting, not deciding if it wants to be a collection of interviews or a noncoherent storyline, virtually no art direction, and inadequately presented information."
3,I expected more,"I had heard so much about this movie that I decided to purchase it. A few things were really cool (Like the water experiment), but I was expecting a lot more from it."
3,Watch before you Bleep this,"Different, Interesting, perhaps more enjoyable smoking something funny, or drinking something strong. But there is a point. I missed it!! However, I enjoyed the subtlties because I was constantly looking for whatever it was I was expecting to see. The flash movement made me feel like I was on a bad trip and I don't mean the friendly skies. You have to have a reason to buy this video and then you are so upset you spent money on it that you tell everyone else how good it is."
2,outdated...,I wish they had elaborated on space time theory based on Super String and M Theory...because it would have chnaged the entire view...
1,New Age Nonsense Dressed Up as Quantum Theory,"Don't let anyone fool you. This movie is NOT about Quantum Theory. It is a propaganda piece made by some New Age con-artist who claims to be ""channeling"" some long-dead ancient teacher named ""Ramtha."" If you are interested in legitimate science, I seriously doubt that this is something to which you will lend any credibility. Like most things that are total malarkey, it is dressed up in just enough real science to fool those who are not looking closely. There is nothing ""hopeful"" about material like this. If you want to learn about Quantum Theory, look for a book by an actual scientist."
1,Where's Emoto?,"This movie was a big pile except for the Emoto sequence. I especially like the water crystal rockin' out to heavy metal in his book "" Messages from Water "" Seems like the rest was pretty much filler, but Emoto is going places for sure. I can only give this one star as they should have just made a documentary about water crystal formations. Everything else is kind of a non-issue by comparison. Next time play working man by Rush, and you'll really see something!"
1,Pseudo-science,"The ""scientists"" in this movie have some impressive titles but their research is shakey at best."
3,Comes off sounding like a cult,"At first I thought, wow, this is amazing, especially the idea that consciousness has effects on reality. However, after seeing the credentials of the 'scientists' repeatedly quoted in the movie, I am a bit put off:1) One lady who shows up repeatedly who purports to be some sort of expert on brain function is actually a chiropractor.2) A proffessor (from Columbia University I beleive) who is quoted repeatedly about quantum physics later issued a statement saying his interview was cut and taken out of context to support the position of the makers of this film.3) And need I add 'Ramtha', who says he is from Atlantis (oh, brother...) but really sounds like he's from Moscow?However, I do give this video two stars for the best despcription of the double slit experiment I have ever seen."
1,Sad that it's on the bestseller list,This movie is total quack science. Please stop giving them money.
1,What's the bleepin' big deal?,"Easily the most over-hyped movie of 2004, What the Bleep do We Know caught the imagination of many who would now purport to hail it as some kind of revelation. Apparrantly there are quite a few people who need to be re-assured that they are in America and free to believe whatever they wish regardless of how silly.This movie is a pat on the head kind of encouragement for people that need positive reinforcement for spiritual views and would like them to be validated by the very science they reject. Luckily the science is so dubious as to not bring the charge of sell-out to New Agers, who may now wade in the shallow end of quantum respectability."
1,Undeserving of all the hype,"this movie was such a disappointment. poorly acted, photographed, and edited it proved to be nothing more than a new age/self-help video. this film's success is a direct result of good PR. nothing more. if you are interested in seeing a beautifully crafted, intellectual documentary that really gets you thinking and that will blow your mind, go see or buy ""Flight from Death: The Quest for Immortality"". this movie is what ""what the bleep"" tried to be but failed miserably at."
1,Simplistic and shallow,"The movie is about interesting topics - quantum physics, psychology, consciousness, spirituality etc. However it completely fails to explain the science, the spirituality part is shallow and worst of all they make lot of statements that are speculative at best but they are stated as fact (often connecting science and spirituality, jumping from scientific statement to a spiritual one as if it was a logical conclusion)."
4,A whole lotta movie,"I found that the Quantum version is great for those who are advanced, but a bit much for beginners to quantum thinking. I would suggest the original for beginners. If you have watched the original and are looking for more from the scientists, this is the movie for you. Personally, I think that they could have done a better job of putting it together. I do not think it is organized well."
2,Extraordinary popular delusion and madness,"There are good arguments in this movie. The trouble is, they're only the minority.From the very beginning, with the absurd ""legend"" of the Central American Indians not seeing the first european boats (that transported the End of their ancient civilization), the movie tries and fails to give a sober and stimulating existentialist/holistic discourse on reality.Overweight palm readers are stirred into a vat of interviews with scientists, theologians, and Tolle-esque charlantans (introduced along with their books available wherever books are sold). Throw in a mini-movie about a woman's hormonal production. Drink up. Repeat as needed. Placibo as ignorance."
1,Pop-up book for the spiritually lazy,"This movie will fill you up and leave you hyper and elated, yet so will pouring a ten-pound bag of refined sugar into your belly. Ultimateley, you will have to move on to find something more substantial, as this is all style no substance. If you become one of the "" just add water "" instantly enlightened adherents to this film, you will eventually spend alot of time and money re-educating yourself on the validity of What the Bleep's absurdist claims. Please educate yourself on the metaphysical concepts vs QM probability theories before you embarass your-self by aping and echoing the film's baseless claims. Shouting down anyone with a contrary opinion, or an attempt at constructive dialogue with ad hominem passive aggresive attacks such as, "" you don't have an open mind "" or "" You're afraid of the new paradigm "" merely retards the conversation to the level of Christian Scientists."
3,LEAP! is better,"Ok ... but LEAP! is betterI'm always amazed when I see ANY movie receiving only 1 star. If the viewer dislikes a movie that much, why on earth would they waste their time continuing to watch it? If you don't like what you're watching, turn off the TV and go do something else. What's even more amazing is the time and effort these people put into writing these long-winded critiques on a movie they hated.If you watch an entire movie and give it 1 star ... that says more about YOU and less about the movie. Now ... I'll stop wasting MY time."
1,Save your money for a shrink,"I am here because my niece loaned me this ""amazing DVD that would change my life"" and I wished to see how many lunatic new age types would be in here promoting this nonsense as fact, raving how it ""makes everything better again"".As usual,no surprises.Junk science and a well known con women who ""channels"" an ancient Atlantian warrior spirit.Need I say more?"
2,A Cult Recruiting Tool,"J.Z. Knight, a cult leader, made this film with the help of some of her members. In fact, most of the people involved in this film (from production staff to interviewees) are members of her cult, based in Yelm, Washington.In fact, a couple of the real scientists in the movie didn't know what sort of project they were getting themselves into.This movie is somewhat thought-provoking, although it's 1/4 real quantum physics, 1/4 metaphysics, and 1/2 made-up crap.The movie is designed to be a recruiting tool for J.Z. Knight's organization.Research ""J.Z. Knight"" on the Internet and see for yourself."
4,Amazing,This movie introduces a very different perspective on viewing our own lives. It is very interesting and I recommend it to everyone who is searching for answers about life.
1,Misleading advertising,"This film is actually a religious tract for an obscure religion invented by JZ Knight. It is misleading to characterize the film as being scientific. It has no Quantum Physics or other scientific contribution, simply tries to use scientific terms to attract adherents."
1,Astonishingly bad,"Saw this last night and was amazed at how bad it was. I was expecting a fugue on quantum physics and philosophy. Instead I had to listen to a supposedly 35,000 year old warrior spirit telling me that I'm god, and a chiropractor (or was it the anesthesiologist?) telling me I can walk on water if I really, really believe. Hmmm, the only thing I really, really believe at present is that I've been bilked out of a few bucks...and, hey, if JZ Knight is so smart, maybe she'll invest that money and come back in another 35,000 years to collect the massive profits..."
1,Unwatchable,"If you are interested in listening to professors talk in circles, then ultimately admit that quantum physics is impossible to explain, then this movie is for you. ""How far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?"" one of them says. Was he really quoting Alice in Wonderland?Let me sum it up for you: Thinking positively about a memory, event, or the future is better than thinking about it negatively. Wow, what a mind blowing concept. I think I learned that when I was 12 yrs old.Now can I go up to Rantha's camp in Washington and get locked in the place? I'd be happy to sign her contract not allowing me to leave the facility, use electricity, etc. I think I'll sit under the $100,000 chandeliers in the horse stables and ponder if reality is real."
3,RENT BEFORE YOU BUY...,"This was a thought provoking movie, and I personally enjoy Marlee Maitlin as an actress, but *DEFINITELY* rent before you buy. I was excited to see the movie when it was released in theaters earlier this year because of the reviews, but was not prepared for the film style - it takes some getting-used-to. Unfortunately, it seemed like we were sitting there for *HOURS*... Each person in our group admitted to zoning out or nodding off for a brief period during the movie, and people actually got up and left at various points throughout. It felt like it could have ended twenty minutes earlier, which is interesting considering it is a ninety-minute movie. I'd like to see it again and give it another chance, since it did raise some thoughtful points. Worth a view, in my opinion."
2,"Beware! Letterboxed, NOT Widescreen","This is one of those DVD's that purport to be ""16x9 Widescreen"" on the box and in the Amazon description, yet when you try to watch it on your widescreen television, it appears with a very thick black border around the image. On some televisions you can ""zoom in"" on the image, but this results in a blurred picture. Owners of widescreen televisions should be aware of this before making the purchase.As to the documentary/movie itself, it is an excellent exploration of some of the more interesting and extreme implications and interpretations of quantum mechanics and M-theory. Were it not for the resolution issues, I would have offered a higher rating (probably a 4 out of 5)."
2,nothing surprising,"After reading other reviews, I decided to get this one for an entertaining and enlightening evening. I am always curious about how life came to be and what purpose a human life is supposed to be in this world. An interesting point made in the movie is that we are here to create (not be created). However, I wasn't impressed with any other discussions even though there are a lot of positive thinking that encourages self-esteems and confidence etc, because I have heard all these angles of thoughts about life a few decades ago. The quantum physics part was over-played and over-used to show how choices would affect your life's path. Note ""Quantum"" theories are not for big ""things"" like humans. The discussions about psychology and emotion are also just common senses."
2,Nice anything-but-scientific movie,"A nice and touching movie. I recommend it if you are searching for self-help inspiration and don't care about anything else.That said, if you think science should be taken seriously then ignore it. This movie is just pure post-modern garbage. There's no single scientific fact presented that could resist the slightest of the examinations."
1,"Heavy dude, Heeeeaaavy.","If I punch you in the head, you shouldn't get angry because matter never touches-----it's all in your mind. If you are bleeding now, as a result of my striking you, that's your problem because you are limited by your narrow perception of reality. You are responsible for the creation of your own reality, right? So stop your whining about the swelling beginning to show, your just projecting. None of this is real, and since you and I are one, I am only guilty of self-abuse. Now I will go weep quietly in the corner.This movie is a giant cartoon representation of metaphysics, (much like my previous paragraph) trying desperately to hide under the covers of quantum mechanics. Happy hippies engaged in the eternal circular logic of the damned."
3,What the Bleep?,"This movie is very good if your a physic major, are into sience,or like weird stories. I liked the blending of the story and expert commentry about what the story (actors)were trying to portray. All in all I liked it. Most people would not unless they were into the sciences (which I am)."
3,Some what superficial,If you are new to the quantum theory this is excellent......but if you are seeking more insight into the metaphysical and quantum physics.....seek elsewhere.
2,Here's Something I know...,"This movie is terrible.Yeah, yeah. I know all about the metaphysics of truth and certainty. I know about chaos theory. I know about quantum theory and its implications on our perceptions of reality. I've read it all before. This movie was far from mind blowing. It simply picked and pulled the finer points from a series of legitimate philosophical and scientific fields and smashed them together into a `new' theory.Go read some Plato, Descartes, Hume and a little Einstein and Hawking and you'll get the solid philosophy and science that this ridiculous film hijacked."
5,Get ready to go deep....,"Get ready to watch this over an over! Like a book that you cannot put down this movie will have you glued to the screen. This movie will shock you, make you laugh, and have you mesmerized throughout it's entirety. Enjoy!"
5,"We are all connected, we are one.","I'd already seen ""What the Bleep"", but the second film took it another step. The assertion that down at the electron level it's nothing but possibility is amazing. Further that electrons can show up in multiple locations at the same time and have knowledge of its other location(s) tells me that we are all ""entangled"" whether we like it or not. So if I hit you I'm actually hitting me. For more, read about ""Matrix Energitics"" or ""The Field."""
5,This is BETTER than science-fiction.,"Mind bending, fun and creative in it's presentation to reveal the inner layers of ourselves. The whole concept of the film is plausible, exciting and new territory in our spiritual growth. This is a must see for all who are searching for more depth into their own behavior. Marlee Matlin gives a stellar performance depicting same life scenarios we all encounter in our lives each day. Awesome film, expands your thinking capabilities."
4,Quantum Physics and Spirituality meets Hollywood,"This movie excellenty presents some very profound subjects about the mysteries of life. I suggest watching the movie at least twice for the message to impact more deeply. It is presented in a most entertaining way, and the characters are all so enjoyable. Who could resist Marlee's beauty and Elaine's bubbly personality. It is a simple movie but so complex at the same time.I hope you enjoy it."
1,This movie will insult your intelligence.,"I had heard good things about this movie, and as a result I was eager to see it. While watching it, I realized most of subject matter was known to me already. This movie kept making a big deal out of simple concepts. I guess if you don't know much about science and want to be overwhelmed with the perfect organization of nature, blah, blah, blah. Then buy this movie."
1,Idiotic Nonsense,"I'm going to keep this (very) short. To be honest, I don't feel the need to justify myself in a long-winded manner. The simple fact of the matter is this: if anyone thinks this movie is worth more than one star, they are too stupid for words."
3,"Physics was Interesting, Metaphysics was not","1) About half of this movie was interesting, and that was the half talking about the actual meat of the scientific matter. It was interesting, it was varied, and it was thought provoking. How does one, simply by observing, impact reality?2) The other half of the movie was, and this infurated me to no end, people then attempting to extrapolite a belief system or religion from this. They didn't extrapolite very far, they got to about Hinduism, then gave up.The movie was worth a watch, but when under-credentialed people sit there trying to use valid points to prove unfounded religious and moral systems, I really wanted to sort of zip forward."
2,Not What You Think,"At first glance, this movie appears to be intelligent and very thought-provoking. However, if one looks deeper into the ideas behind the movie, one will see it is not as intriguing as one may think. While it comes off as a scientific look at what may be in our future, it is not so much. Researching the backgrounds of the members in the movie will reveal that this film is more of a New Age group's propaganda scheme. If you want to impress your friends, have them watch it with you and act as if you know exactly what they are discussing throughout the movie. If you want an inside look at quantum physics and science's hope in the future, look elsewhere."
3,Gee Whiz,"While at times entertaining, anyone who has a good liberal arts education, or who keeps current of pop science and psychology via Time, Newsweek or the New York Times, will find this not such a gee-whiz-gosh-dang-wow experience. Additionally, narrator Marlee Matlin's feigned excitement was especially annoying. Her speech disability proved intrusive and her ""acting"" was atrocious. I was disappointed."
1,Ignorance of the Worst Kind,"The creators of this video obviously had either very little grasp of quantum mechanics (Granted, not many people have a good grasp of that), or the motivation to twist it to meet their needs.They take an incomplete view of quantum science and warp it into a self-help philosophy that has practically nothing to do with science at all, and is in fact misleading about the science.The self-help portions are also very weak, resting most obviously on the idea that changing our perceptions of reality actually change reality. A waste of a couple hours and class time I could have used sleeping."
1,quantum heap,"What the *bleep* do we know? Evidently not too *bleeping* much, if you chose to sit through this steaming pile of New Age mind manure. Even its extremely limited success will make you fear for the future of the human race."
2,It's not really a movie at all but...,"There's no plot to speak of, but discussions of quantum physics in terms that regular folks can try and grasp are always welcome."
1,Feh.,"What a boring movie. I went to see this because a friend told me it was ""subversive"" and ""will turn your world upside down."" It actually was just a warped view of quantum physics as explained by some new-age cultists that didn't have the nerve to tell you that they were mystics channeling some ancient Egyptian untill the very end. And it put me to sleep.Apparently they think that quantum physics proves that we can create our own reality, and somebody took pictures of crystals to prove it. I would just once love to see any of these woo-woo nutjobs subject their theories to even the slightest bit of scrutiny by real scientists. What an insult, and it was not even very interestingly done."
4,Thought provoking,"The movie is interesting if you are the thinking type and in the mood for intellectual exploration rather than sheer entertainment. It's the kind of film you have to interact with or you may fall sound asleep. The plot with Marly just isn't that engaging and at times the background music and/or added ambient sound completely overwhelms the dialog, which is generally delivered at quantum speed. Its a hybird film, part documentary, part science lesson and part not so believable angst ridden photographer's story. The story script is over acted and the ""Mary Poppins"" like personality of the photographer's rather surreal roomie is a bit over the top. JZ Knight's channeling of Ramtha is also a bit of an annoyance, especially when She drifts in and out of his British accent. Her garish costume doesn't help either, making her look less than believable even though her comments are appropriate. Do the French know the Atlantean's were British??"
1,"""Know""?","The word ""Know"" implies knowledge and this movie is about irrational belief, not knowledge. Science and reason are used to support religious ideas in the form of New Age only where they can be supportive. The lines of reasoning that conflict with the theology are ignored. The result is a slick series of nonsensical connections."
1,terrible claptrap,"i bought this on impulse, thinking it might be something as interesting and good as sagan's cosmos. it is terrible. full of self congratulatory interviews, goofy metaphysics, and shaky science, i cannot believe anyone with better than the discriminating powers of a blinded slug would enjoy this. marlee matlin would be better having low rent sex with jason lee in his knowingly stupid show."
1,"New Age, All the Rage----screwing the takers","New Agers are easily distracted by shiny objects, knowing this and appealing to their inflated ego will translate into dollars every time. They all want reinforcement to their comfort zone, namely, "" I am in control. "" What the Bleep? knows it's target audience well when they claim that not only can you psychologically affect your physiological being but. . . Reality is completely dependent upon you! This is a New Ager's greatest dream come true as it appeals to their child-like nature which for whatever reason was not permitted to mature. This leaves the New Ager stuck in a I Me Mine, Gimme Gimme Gimme----MY TOY! cell of their own making. What the Bleep flips this on it's head and turns a negative into a double negative thereby conversely and perversely positive. This Movie is Strictly for ego-whores"
4,SO what if it is a hoax?,"I find it disappointing to hear some people calling this film an infomercial for Ramtha. Please think before you react. Alot of good things have come from this. I've personally seen alot of positive change in friends that I thought would never find the light of day regarding their negativity towards themself and the world. To those that say it is a hoax, so what if it is. Positivity in human conciousness is a rarity these days. And for those who help those encapsulated within fear and negativity, I can only applaud them, even if it is a money-making scheme. For those of you who have negative feelings, I guess you need to make money every week too, and are you having a positive effect on your present personal environment by assinating a messenger through your written words? I am not a Ramtha devotee but I think eveyone can benefit from the message in this film."
2,What the Bleep Was Marlee Matlin Saying?,"I rarely leave a negative review. However, this film warranted it.It was hard enough to follow the ""water intelligence"" theory, but Marlee Matlin was even HARDER to understand! I realize that she is deaf (and a fine actress) but....the combination of her story intercut back and forth with Emoto's theory made the whole film unbearable. We got lost from the beginning, and it got worse from there."
2,Intriguing ideas but poorly put together,"I am totally *in* to the topic of this film and I found a lot of the ideas quite fascinating. But the ideas are presented in such a disjointed fashion that I found it a bit distracting and difficult to follow. The scientists usually spoke for only a few minutes or so before they were interupted by some lame storyline or graphic.Also, why do they wait until after the film to list the names/credentials of scientists? Bad idea."
2,Too New Age,Bought it once; viewed it twice. Holding it for later when I'm more mature (I'm only 65!) Or for when I suspend my current belief system. Gentleman friend loved it (he's not spiritually settled yet).
1,Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes!,"i rented this movie because i thought it was going to be a thought-provoking flick. Something different, you know? They call it 'A Sleeper Hit'. Well, i was almost a sleeper after the first 10 minutes of the repetative phrase ""Quantum Physics"". if i wanted that kind of thought-provoking material, i would go back to school. i don't see what everyone is raving about. Worst waste of my money."
1,"When ""open-minded"" means ""gullible""","People who rate this movie in the 5 star range are those who embrace things like channeling, psychics, and water witching. If you go to palm-readers, consult tarot cards, and channel cosmic forces through quartz crystals, this movie is for you. People who rave about this movie are so open-minded, their brains have fallen out.This movie demonstrates how absolutely any belief system can find a few prominent people to support it. The movie is a case study in how the most inane view of the world can try to clothe itself in respectable garb suitable for the 21st century. Unfortunately, the movie only succeeds for those who are already predisposed to accept things like the J.Z. Knight cult who follows the teachings of Ramtha, the sage from Atlantis.I gave this movie one star, because the review tool does not allow zero stars."
1,Reality,"An excellent summary of who and what creation is about. It does not necessarily attack the religions in the world but it does confront the fundamentalists of any belief system who would have us believe in a simplistic view of God.. Particularly those who would want us to believe in a rigid set of ""Rules"" to getus ""through"".This DVD helps to create the belief and to some extent establish that ""God"" is an incredible Mystery and that ""Creation"" does have a profound ""Purpose"" of which we are all an important part"
1,What the Bleep is going on in this movie???,I'm sorry to give this movie a 1 star... I bought it because of all the good reviews from this website...I'm glad I only payed 1/2 price for a used one from block buster...I only watched the first 30 min. of the movie and then turned it off...Because I did not know what the bleep they where talking about...Maybe they saved the best for last...I'll never know...Like I said this site gave good reviews for this movie...Maybe they saw something I did not....
1,Ramtha Infomercial,"I will not take up space with my views of the film. They are not important. Let it suffice to say that this film is basically a five million dollar infomercial for a cult called the Ramtha School of Enlightement. The vast majority of the ""experts"" in this movie are indeed teachers at the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, run by JZ Knight, a NAM (New Age Millionair) in Yelm, Washington. Do your research before buying (into) this one."
1,"It is sad when people make a movie like this, it is heart breaking when so many people believe it.","This movie is great if you think that you are a victim of fate. That your DNA controls why you are in a dead end job or cannot quit smoking. Insipiration is its only redeeming quality. The basis of this movie in science is misguided and trivial at best.If you need a ""Nobel Lie"" to make you feel better, well this is your movie. If you actually want to understand physics,biology, philosophy or even reality there are thousands upon thousands of commonly ignored books on just such topics.It is truly sad when people make a movie like this, it is heartbreaking when so many people believe it. It shows that humanity as a whole is no longer capable of exercising either logic or reason. Ironically, if this movie makes sense to you, then ""nothing"" is your answer to its title and premise."
5,I saw this one three times at the theater!,"And I know lots of people saw it even more than that. It is without a doubt my second favorite movie of the year, and was my most favorite until Fahrenheit 911 started playing. I regret this movie didn't make it to every big screen, it is about what we (the human race) are at the core. Noting the subject matter, it was all at the same time unbelievably funny, educational, serious, and spiritual. I have encouraged everyone I know to see it; I will probably buy 10 of it's DVDs."
1,Could have been,"Could have been a fascinating and informative DVD...if it had not included the intertwined cultist views. As a researcher in psychology and neurotransmitters, there is some very facinating and informative pieces, but for the layman the potential effects of misleading pseudo-science is far to high."
5,"Next Level, from the Original Film.","When I saw the original film, I wanted to see more... well, by The Law of Attraction... there's this Quantum Edition.Just Great."
5,Superb,This is one of the most thought provoking pieces to come along in a long time. A Must See for anyone with curiosity and an open mind.
5,Worth your time,Watching these DVD's was really an experience to me..opening up what I already knew and adding what I could see. I can recommend it to anyone open for personal growth and willing to discover their own resistance to openmindness... Please do proceed to 'the Secret'...in this sequence it worked out for me!
5,EVERYONE CAN SEE THIS,"If I had to pick only one DVD to own, this would be it. It is jammed pack full of everything there is to think about.I Replay this time &again; to keep my perspective. Much thought is provoked. Yet, this is just a ""jumping off"" place, as the saying goes. If you investgated the works of each of the presenters/talking heads you would certainly be busy for many years.ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!!! I just need to be constantly reminded."
3,short comment,"I haven't seen the film, but I have read a comment by the quantum physicist who was interviewed for this film, and he was very angry with the filmmakers. After he patiently explained things to them for a couple of hours, they twisted his words around so that the film implies him saying almost the opposite of what he actually said."
5,REALITY CHECK,"This film is exactly what the world needs. Of course it will be met with criticism by those who are afraid to challenge what they have been led to believe their entire lives. Even if you don't fully understand or accept every idea in the film, it opens your mind to ponder the POSSIBILITIES. That's all it does or is meant to do.If you have deep religious beliefs, it may come off as offensive. But it is not ""cultish"" at all, as some have described it. I mean, who's to say that todays most popular religions aren't all cults?This movie has nothing to do with religion or new age thinking, unless you are deeply religious or afraid of new age thinking!Watch it with an open mind, the way your mind SHOULD be operating in the first place. It will make you feel good. I enjoyed it very much and it changed my outlook on life for the better."
3,Use your brain!,"And take that however you want. I knew going in that this was a Ramtha production but really who cares? Whether all the ""facts"" were indeed facts or fiction didn't make much difference to me; I'm smart enough but I don't know squat about quantum physics and wouldn't take any one source to be entirely true. And at that, one of the biggest messages I took away from this movie was to question everything, make up your own mind, don't be a sheep.The idea that we needn't be victims, and that we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and create a better life by changing our perceptions, that's worth pursuing, whether you're atheist, Christian, Ramthan (?), Buddhist, etc. Not many movies that I see that provoke any kind of discussion at all, so flawed as it may be, a nice change from the usual Hollywood fare."
1,Painful to watch,"This was a hack job in the editing room, resulting in a mess of confusion. I'm amazed that it took three directors. The old adage too many chefs are gonna spoil the soup. . .Arntz may have provided the funding, but this is definitely a Ramtha production as virtually everyone involved ( including Arntz ) are members. Create your own reality by rejecting theirs, when Dylan asked what everyone could take out of the 60's he replied, "" Don't follow leaders. ""I'm waiting for the cross merchandising with fast food chains to materialize. Could a Ramtha action figure, or create your own bubble set be on it's way?Life is a wonderful beautiful gift and I can't wait to see what happens next!"
1,Pseudo-physics nonsense!,"This movie has the look and feel of a documentary of sorts, with ""interviews"" with people who-- until you read their credits-- are made to appear to be credible scientists. In fact, they're not credible anything! One woman is actually someone who claims to be ""channeling"" some spirit. Another ""scientist"" has his degrees from...the Maharishi University, or something like that.The fictional drama woven between the interviews is confusing and, in my opinion, totally nonsensical.The only thing mildly entertaining or interesting is the special effects."
1,I hate fraud!,"After a basically step-by-step path through some of the possible implications of Quantum Physics, the film suddenly leaps to conclusions for which it has not established a basis. I thought I had missed something, so I backed up and watched again. I realized that the whole thing was a ruse. They set you up with some valid science to make you receptive, and then attempt to slip unfounded and definitely unproven claims past you. I was disgusted. There is so much for us to learn about the questions posed by quantum theory and pretenders such as these pollute the waters. Some of the scientists shown are legitimate, but their presence is apparently used to attempt to make the fakes appear authentic. My recommendation for those interested in the topic of ""what do we really know?"" is the book ""The Mind of God"" by Paul Davies."
4,Open it up,"If you're thinking of buying or renting this as a Saturday night popcorn flick, then yeah, you're likely going to be disappointed.If you go to the What the Bleep website first and read up on what it's all about, then at least you'll know what you're getting into.The only way you're going to enjoy this...movie? documentary?... is if you are the kind of person who has an open mind to different views of our world, how it works and your place in it.If it doesn't change your life or even make you think about it, at the very least it's a wicked discussion topic afterwards, that is, if you can wrap your head around it.I bought it, I liked it, I've watched it twice and will watch it again - for no other reason than its given me something new to open my mind to that I've never even considered before."
2,What the Bleep You SHOULD Know Before You Go...,"This movie is the product of three students of JZ Knight, who channels ""Ramtha."" Who's ""Ramtha,"" you ask? According to JZ Knight, he's a warrior who lived 35000 years ago on the lost continent of Lemuria, which then conveniently sank into the ocean, leaving no pesky evidence to counter JZ's claims. (JZ, by the way, is the bottle blonde talking head in the film with the sometime Elizabethan accent.) A lot of people are seeing this film in hopes of learning more about quantum physics and how it can enlarge our understanding of God. That's a worthy field of study, but alas, the answers are not to be found in this particular film. Some of the science may be legit, but the theological speculation is just New Age claptrap. ""Ramtha,"" by the way, has been copyrighted by JZ Knight. For more info on this, you can google for Ramtha's School of Enlightenment."
4,Good if only to make you think,"I saw the movie, and I agree with both the pros and cons listed here. I definitely thought the Ramtha stuff was flaky, and the plot drifted all over the place.But I didn't know anything about quantum physics before seeing the movie, and since then have read a few books on it. So the movie got me to learn something I didn't know before.There is a really interesting interview with the director and one of the scientists at www.xplanazine.com/mosaic/mosaic.html. They address everything that the one star and five star reviewers are mentioning.So see it if only to spur yourself to learn something new."
1,Hard to get if your not a mad scientist....,"This went to deeply into the quantum science of attraction and intention and I had a hard time figuring out what I was suppose to be learning in this DVD. Purchase ""the Secret"" DVD and you will be on your way...this DVD let me down in more ways than one!"
3,Best if you have not seen What The Bleep,"This movie is 80% the same as their earlier ""What the Bleep"" movie.The first 5 minutes and the 2 Dr. Quantum cartoons are the bigdifference - those are very good. The rest of the movie is muchthe same as the fine ""What the Bleep"" movie. On it's own, it's a goodmovie - but for those who already watched and understood the ""What the Bleep"" movie - this movie is pretty redundant.If you have not watched ""What The Bleep"" - then this is a good movie to watch!"
3,jumbled,"The underlying message of the movie was amazing. The movie itself seems to try to be too many things. The halfway developed story of the photographer has no relationship to the brilliant scientists. The animated sequence of human cells addicted to certain emotions seems superimposed on the story in a careless way. Basically, all the seams, stitches and bolts are showing. This is unfortunate because the interviews with the scientists really elucidate the staggering importance and implications of quantum physics in very easy-to-understand language. The animation of the cells, neurons and hypothalamus also makes things clear. If nothing else, see it for the subway scene with the Japanese Water Experiment. That was a paradigm shift in and of itself!!! The movie as a whole is just put together poorly."
5,Awesome movie!,"This movie is really food for thought! Sometimes we think our society in this age is so advanced, but we really have so much more to learn.Watched it several times and now am passing it around!"
5,Excellent - Even just for entertainment,"We have watched this several times, and several times we get something different. This is thought provoking, but repetitive and a little boring in parts.....Overall though, it's worth the watch - the Ramtha channelling leaves a lot to be believed, JZ Knight does come over as a fake, but it's picked up by the qualified Dr's who express some new light onto old theories."
5,Down the Rabbit Hole Quantum,Love the movie and the series. Very informative for spiritualists. EXCELLENT reminder on how life works. Get it NOW!
3,"These are not simple concepts therefore, this movie is not for","everyone. I recommend the newer, "" Down the Rabbit Hole version"" watch only the second disc. It's more creatively illustrated so, it's easier to understand than the first... a repeat of the first, only longer. You may still need to watch parts several times to grasp the concepts. some you may never understand."
2,Ruined An Excellent Film,"If you want to watch the original film the way it was in the theaters and on the first DVD, you can't. The randomness is a novel idea but it created a disjointed collage that interrupts my thoughts, concentration and enjoyment. The whole movie isn't even on one disc. They split it onto two discs. The interviews are a good addition but if you want to watch the movie buy the What the Bleep DVD separately."
1,not worth my money,This movie was corny and stupid. I really should have trusted the bad reviews about it. I definintely should not have bought it!! I didnt even watch the whole thing. I just threw it in the trash.
1,How did this boring garbage get made??!,"As repeated by MANY reviewers, do NOT waste your time or money on this bizarre, convoluted mess. I love movies, good AND bad, and was talked into seeing this one on the big screen...and to this day, it stands alone in the list of movies I truly HATE HATE HATE. I had to sit throught the whole excruciating thing, too...and don't wish that on ANYONE.Give me fingernails on a chalkboard any day, over this pile of @%$^@#%)$%!"
1,Intriguing,"I've never seen (nor heard of) this movie, but the reviews are so compelling that I've just got to order it."
1,What the Bleep Do We Know!? Not much.,"Even if you knew what all the talking heads were really talking about, all about quantum mechanics and the collapse of the wave function, even if you knew all about that, this mess of a movie has got its physics, the little there is of it, all wrong. And because of its mix up between the micro world and the macro, the movie makes assertions about our sense of reality that are leaps of mysticism or faith. If you understood what I just said, then you'll know to skip this new-age mumbo jumbo. If you didn't understand what I just said, you won't understand this bizarre ride either, which is just as well."
5,open your mind,"have you ever noticed that the really narrow-minded people arethe ones who love to shout loudest an cannot stand for someone else's mind to think something they don't like? the reviews (1 star) of this movie sound like a bunch of rants to me.i liked it. very much. it shows another way to lookat what's goin on. you don't have to like it, but what's wrong with someone looking at another poinr of view? i'm young. To me these are very interesting ideas, like take some respoinsiblity for yr life and think about your choices becuz it makes a difference even all the way to the molcules. if you haven't seen it, try it, you might learn a new idea!"
1,It's like War of the Worlds by Welles. . .Don't be a sucker,"Worst movie I have ever seen, by a long shot. I'm willing to bet it's in the top three of all time terrible flicks. Hopefully, I'll never have to wade through anything comparable to this again. I paid money to have brain cells killed without even the compromise of getting baked. Pure highway robbery. Beyond ridiculous, some of the other reviewers can elaborate more on the she-male Ramtha who orchestrated this absurd fraud."
1,Terribly dissapointing.,"I like books like ""The Elegant Universe"" that talks about string theory. I enjoy authors like Asimov, Sagan and Hawkings. I rented this movie because it said it was going to explain Quantum Physics. After watching it for twenty minutes, it became too painful to go on, so I stopped it and came to the Internet. After reading Amazon's description, I knew I needed to go no further.In this movie, science and unsupported claims are mixed in an effort to validate all kind of stuff. I highly recommend ""The Demon Haunted World"". In it, Carl Sagan speaks about J.Z. Knight (more accurately, JZ Knight, the ""narrator"" in this movie) as follows:""Suppose Ramtha were available for questioning... How does he know that he lived 35,000 years ago, even approximately? ... What were things like 35,000 thousand years ago? Either Ramtha is 35,000 years old, in which case we discover something about that period, or he's a phoney and he'll (or rather she'll) slip up."""
5,IMAGINE,"S-T-R-E-T-C-H your mind. L-I-S-T-E-N to other points of view. T-H-I-N-K. Then, T-H-I-N-K some more. Follow your nose to where it leads you..."
5,Great way to explain with ease and scientifically some dogmas and old paradigms,I like this dvd very much because its entertaining and it has an easy to catch message.
5,Not casual party viewing,"If you are versed in string theory, parallel universe thinking or quantum physics, you are ready for this DVD. It's not casual party viewing. It would be an excellent tool for a Salon, a discussion group, or a solitary seeker. It will expand your vision and raise questions that will require revisiting this DVD over and over again for deeper meanings. DVD format is very helpful in terms of actually being able to see the concepts being expressed and explained. Still, they require a contemplative environment and deep thought. If that's not your idea of a good time, stick with something silly.I've never enjoyed a DVD more in my life."
2,"Dianetics, anyone?","The first half was interesting and I felt I was learning, but then came the crazed wedding and the learning abruptly stopped. Then in the second half of the film I was apparently being preached to by Scientologists. What the hell was that about? I looked in the credits for Dianetics or something related, but stopped looking after a bit. I would assume this was made by Scientologists."
3,Just ok,The show is interesting but not as captivating as The Secret. The actress did a marvelous job in the show too!
3,What the Bleep Do We Know!,The video's basic premise that we are all interrelated and only know what we know because of our experiences or by what we have formally learned is right on target. Their presentation of urban legions as fact is most disturbing. This distracts the viewer and raises the validity of their entire presentation. Over all it was OK but could have been better.
4,New perspective!,"This is an interesting documentary-type film that will give you a new perspective. I don't know if I agree with everything, but it certainly opened my eyes in some areas. Interesting insight into human behavior patterns. Not for kids, but worth watching to broaden one's understanding of how we ""tick."""
5,Excellent!,Excellent information on how we perceive reality combined with interesting findings on quantum physics. Very useful for those in search of scientific explanations to spiritual concepts.
4,Great stuff,this film has been seen by many of my friends and is a great talking point. it is wonderfully thought provoking and has a lot in it on reality perception. What is truth? only what you perceive it to be. Worth taking at least two looks.
1,"Do Fish ""Bleep"" & Answers to Other Amazing Mysteries","Does your water speak Spanish?When you flush your commode, is it talking you?Should you talk to your toilet, if you are feeling a little flushed?Was ""Columbus"" incapable of ""seeing"" an Indian?Is ""Ramtha"" a reincarnated rectal suppository?These and other amazing mysteries, such as: ""Do fish fxxt"" and ""are the makers of this film laughing at me"" are answered by the greatest movie since Gigli.Don't be fooled by science.Don't be bothered by facts.Reality is bad!Mental illness is good!Why read a book when you can watch a movie.Enlightenment for only $19.95!Hear the one true message of hope: ""Give me your money, give me your money, give me your money...""Open your mind and your pocket book and buy 10, no, 100 copies! and watch it over and over and over and over and over..."
5,Thought Provking,I enjoyed the movie. Critic's are speaking strongly about the content as are those who liked the movie. My intent with the movie was to consider the subject. Quite honestly I don't know if its all true or not. I do believe the mind has tremendous power beyond what we undestand. I am willing to allow the possibility that we have more impact on our experience than we realize. That is what I got from the movie. There is much more in it but in the end its a reminder that we are responsible for what we think. Our perception is our reality and often that is our choice.
1,I feel conned,"I just saw this film, which I somehow managed to miss. I have studied the history of science (in graduate school!), so I know what a paradigm shift is. I have also had mystical experiences and believe that thought can affect matter (I've even bent a fork). But this movie feels like a con. Either quantum physics actually does ""support"" mystical experience, or it doesn't. I honestly don't care. But I don't like searching around on line and finding comments from scientists who were interviewed for this film and feel they were misrepresented. I don't like people presenting work like Emoto's, which is aesthetic, but not even remotely the product of sound experiemental methods, as if it is science. And the film itself reminded me of a bad acid trip. All the directors are members of the Ramtha cult. Unless you are, too, I would pass. Either you will dislike it, or you will fall for it. Please don't."
1,"Don't step in the Bleep, strictly for culties","What the Bleep Do We Know is like shoveling copious amounts of kitty litter down your throat, you may temporarily alleviate hunger, but at what cost? Can you possibly consume enough of that stuff to mask the giant turd, that was once your brain?For some people, keeping an open mind involves closing your eyes and following any appeal to your ego. The Universe does not, with baited breath, wait to see if you will rubberstamp it's continued existence, nor does it deal in polls to see where mankind's intention as a whole lay and adjust itself accordingly.This DVD will make jabbering chimpanzees out of many otherwise well intentioned individuals. Taking seriously the musings of Dr. Michel Ledwith, ( Pedarest ) and a she-male god(dess?) named Ramtha, in conjunction with discourse about quantum mechanics from a "" Life Coach, "" the good, "" Dr "" Joe Dispenza, will leave you staggering out the other end of the rabbit hole deaf, dumb, and blind."
1,Terrible,"I was expecting something on the par of Brian Greene's Elegant Universe, but found subjectivity without any substance. I was disappointed to find the film did not site the people being interview (Mr. Joe Doe from Harvard, etc), nor did those people bring any specific evidence or background to what was said. They repeated the same opinion over and over. I expected this to have some explaination of quantum physics (like Elegant Universe), followed by at least a connecting and cohesive point of view derived from quantum physics. Instead, the producers made the science seem too incomprehensible for ordinary people to understand it, so they didn't explain it. In addition, the background music was so loud that it was impossible to concetrate on what was being said. I had to turn on the subtitles. Finally, the constant use of CG made it look like a ride at Disney, rather than an insightful documentary."
1,This film belongs down the rabbit hole as far as it can go!,"I have always loved to watch anything I could find on Quantum theories or space. I was shocked how horrible this film was, I got passed a fellow saying how he planned he day and decides with his mere thoughts how his day was going to unfold, the movie was only getting an F at this point, but by the time the second person at a wedding started to engage in sex that's when my finger hit the eject button. I think that was about 30 or so mins. into the film. That's as far as I got on this film. Perhaps the film got better after where I stopped watching it. On the positive side of this film the case it came in was very attractive. Reviewed by me ray"
4,Throws up many ideas and challenges,"As long as you are a critical thinker and don't believe a thing simply because an expert tells you 'it is true', this is an excellent product. I particularly recommend it to those who already have some knowledge of philosophy and quantum physics or those who are willing to do their own serious and in-depth research after watching the film. It does not get five stars because it is, in the end, not a formal academic contribution to a field of knowledge but a product designed to entertain and make money."
4,Better than the movie :),"I own the 'normal' version of WTB, but wanted more academic discussion on the topic. The 'Rabbit Hole' is not a thesis on quantum physics of course, but if you enjoyed the 'non-drama' bits of the original, then you will really like this version."
1,Bleep indeed.,"The directors of this film are disciples of J.Z.Knight - a new age quack who claims to channel a 5,000 year old warrior from Atlantis who appeared to her in her kitchen in the 1970s. Knight also makes an appearance in the film, pontificating on quantum physics of all things. Who are they trying to kid?I don't think anything more needs to be said, this film is simply new age tripe."
2,I was not so impressed with this film,"I felt the film was forcing people to think of mystic world, but it didn't work for me. It was probably meant for promoting spirituality, but I felt as if I had seen a promotional video of a new age religious cult. I suppose it was a mixture of Kabbalah and Buddhism or something, but the overly dramatized expression of the ideas was a turn-off for me. It also was like a cheesy science program that lacks a solid logic. I personally prefer learning from ancient religious scripts to learning through this type of silly movie if I ever have to learn something."
2,Can I return this?,"This was to a large extent a bunch of fluff BS. I thought it would have taken a more serious look at the subject. There is ""some"" thought provoking material here but it was presented in some sort of goofy MTV rock video format. Alot of it was Marlee Matlin partying and exhibiting nutty behavior. Waste of money in my opinion."
1,Bad science meets New Age Spirituality,"I really hoped this would be an interesting exploration of quantum physics and other subjects. Instead it badly misrepresented quantum theory, continually extended various theories beyond the theory in an effort to link it with spirituality. The ""experts"" make the science sound so plausible, until you realize it's WRONG! For example, were the Native Americans in 1492 really unable to see Columbus' ships because their appearance was so far out of their reality that their brains were unable to process the images? I couldn't find that on the 'net anywhere...Check out this link for a further discussion of the movie's ""science:"" www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/archives/000083.html"
1,Not science,"Warning - before you buy or rent this, please note that the people talking about quantum physics in this movie probably know less about it than you do. They are psychologists, Doctors of Chiropractic and people who wrote books with titles such as ""The Quantum Book of Living, Dying, Reincarnation & Immortality"". (google them) It is more self-help than science. This is for those who seek help finding their way in this world. If you like this kind of stuff, fine. If you are interested in science, stay away."
1,Ramtha vs Godzilla,"I thought Ramtha wouldn't stand a chance against Godzilla, boy was I wrong. It was close for awhile and the mighty lizard fought marvelously, even setting her wig alight. Ramtha's mouth then yawned wide and let loose a blast of pestilence so foul it took Godzilla's head clean off!Then, the terrible sound of flexing muscle, tearing sinew, and popping cartelidge echoed over downtown tokyo, as Ramtha dislocated her jaw, and proceeded to swallow Godzilla's smoking torso in three spastic grunts!I can't tell you what happens next, but be sure you will see the return of the sinister Dr. Emoto and his minions of ice.Ramtha kicked so much butt I was a little disappointed that she retired to the volcanorama... The rest of the movie was mostly scientists speculating on what if Ramtha and Godzilla were to breed, and if a tree crapped in the woods would it make a sound?More Ramtha next time, less blah blah blah. I gotta bail through the Mobius strip now, and try not to get nuttedLaters"
1,new age drivel,"I love Marlee Matlin. I hated this... I'd say movie, but that's not quite the term. Torture session, would be more like it. The people who are most likely to get something from this are people who are just beginning to realize that everything they were taught as children as being black or white is really gray. Otherwise its POOR new age drivel.Yes, I realize that the last sentence leaves room for there to be good new age drivel. Let me know when you find it.If you want enlightenment I refer you to the work of THICH NHAT HANH. Learn how to experience what you're living instead of being told that you really aren't."
1,Worst cult promo piece ever...,"1. The movie's production values are terrible, special effects that aren't so special, terrible acting, and terrible editing.2. Now to the cult stuff... The film is produced by members of the Ramtha religion/cult and basically offers second tier philosophers and scientist to back up auspicious claims about science, and metaphysics.3. The Ramtha cult is led by a woman, shown predominately in the film, who claims to channel a warrior spirit from Atlantis. The behavior of the religion she leads is quite suspect, attendance is mandatory; followers are asked to covert their possessions into gold and to store their gold at the Ramtha compound, etc etc. But don't take my word for it... please read about the Ramtha religion here and make your own mind up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramtha[...]I would not suggest this movie at all... unless of course, you're looking to be indoctrinated by a cult."
4,Religion and Science a/k/a Faith and Reason,"Very interesting film that brings to light that which the great religions of the world have been saying metaphorically. That we are all part of God and God is part of us. The notion of right and wrong was thrown away by Jesus and Buddha and replaced with contemplative thought. Read Richard Rohr's work and understand how this is nothing new, but a new way of looking at spirituality. This will be debated for as long as the human mind feels the need to understand and pursue the answer to ""Why?"". This film tries in many instances to prove through scientific methods the existence and nature of God as God is understood in the major religions.People who closed their minds to contemplative thought will find this film illuminating. Those that started down the ""rabbit hole"" already will find this film to ratify what they have experienced spiritually."
1,Shallow mysticism backed by bad science,"This movie takes new age mysticism, backs it up with misinterpreted, out-of-context, and unreliable science, and tries to pass off this unsavory melange as something profound and spiritually uplifting. Don't take it seriously for an instant. There is nothing of value to be found here."
3,Documentry trends,"I think the movie would have been a much more well rounded and truthful presentation if there were opposing points of view by other ""experts"" whose credentials were equal to or greater than the ""experts"" presented in the film. I feel that this documentary, as well as others (for example, Michael Moore) are successful because they are incredibly biased in their presentation. This then has a two-way effect on audiences. One, it becomes a ""preaching to the choir"" and it's the choir that makes these films successful because it's validating thoughts and beliefs. And two, they become controversial to others with opposite points of view because they are offending that demographic by not allowing their voice to be heard, which also furthers the success.I can't bring myself to giving this film the one star it deserves because in this instance, I am the choir. But at least I'm honest about that."
2,Ultimately Annoying,"Though the concept of a new paradigm of consciousness and reality was interesting, what did the story about the deaf photographer have to do with it? Was that necessary to spread the message, and if it was, why did it have to be so annoyingly disjointed. At least it annoyed me! Plus, I fell asleep toward the end. I guess I will have to read the book!"
4,Good introduction to Quantum physics!,"I have studied Quantum physics as well as M-theory and relativity extensively. This movie is good as an introduction to the subject, however it is light in contents and it creates more questions than answers for the average viewer, nevertheless it is a good start to an eye opening experience. The movie is based mostly on the Copenhagen interpretation of QP and little to nothing is shown about other interpretations on the matter, there is a lot more to the subject than this movie can provide, but than that is all they can do with about two hours of time. The picture quality on this dvd is simply outstanding. The overall picture fidelity is impeccable and you will enjoy it if equipped with a good screen."
5,Science and the Spiritual finally meet!,"I loved this film. I disagree with other reviewers that this film lacks science. You have to understand Quantum Physics, to debate it. Most of the positive reviews state what I would here, so I won't repeat what's already been said. This film was such a joy to watch. I don't think Knight's physical appearance has a thing to do with what Ramtha stated. Who cares what Knight looks like? I enjoyed it all. I thought it was brilliant to use a deaf main character/actress! Excellent!"
3,irritating,"We live in a world of political correctness and walk on egg shells. This movie really crossed the line when the producers opted to cast a deaf/mute lady who was incomprehensible and annoying; I wish I would've walked out of the theater but the movie was interesting despite the choice of actors.It's not politically correct to have subtitles whenever the mute lady talked but Jesus, I couldn't understand ANYTHING she said!The film is of diffucult subject matter anyway, why make it harder for people to comprehend it by casting a lady who can barely speak?"
5,Instructive Without Being Pedantic,"This movie will prove irresistible to fans of The Power of Myth. 21st Century philosophy with 12 step undertones. You can't just watch it once, it's like peanuts."
1,Meh,"If you are looking to gain a better understanding of actual Quantum Physics and not Pseudo-Meta-Quanto-Spirituality, then this movie is not for you. This movie is basically Ben Stein's ""Expelled"" for New Ager's, instead of creationists."
2,Meh,"It's alright through parts, some interesting neuro biology. It gets bogged down towards the end though, and turns into a self help guide on how to be happy and overcome addiction. No thanks."
3,Still Bleeped,"Some people get it and are moved, life-changingly moved. I'm too analytical, so I'm not so moved, but still...""have you ever seen yourself through the eyes of the new person you've become?"""
5,What the 8&*%$? ;),"I owned a copy of the original What the Bleep and gave it to my sister. So I was quite excited to see the new Quantum edition. I really like what they have added and all the new material. Wow! What a bargain. Fascinating stuff on the media. Looks like they either updated with some new interviews or added in some of the interviews that failed to make the initial cut. Whatever, it's a neat improvement. And now there are three DVDs in the box!Side note about Amazon Customer Service. I'm quite impressed. I ordered my What the Bleep on 12/7/2007 and it never showed up. Tracking had it in a few odd places. I reported to Amazon Customer Service and they promptly sent me another at no charge! It's rare to see good Customer Service these days."
1,propaganda beware!!,"this film is pure pseudo science. it is propaganda for ""RAMTHA'S SCHOOL OF ENLIGHTENMENT"" Many of the ""scientists"" interviewed are members of this ""ramtha school"" I feel sorry for the people who mistook this movie as a genuine scientifically unbiased film.do some research before you watch this movie, then make up yourown mind."
1,WTBDWK/Ramtha = gross ignorance + egotism,"I started thinking ""What the bleep do *they* know?"" when I heard ""water is the most receptive of the four elements"" (33:47). NONE of the classical four elements (air vs. earth & fire vs. water), which are still used in astrology, are shown the Periodic Table of the Elements, which has 94 natural elements. The Ramtha people should have paid attention in high school science class. For more on WTBDWK's water nonsense, see the Wikipedia article on Masaru Emoto.Also, at 1:23:08, Joe Dispenza says ""... most people surrender and live their life in mediocricy..."", but 'mediocricy' is not a real word-- 'mediocrity' is. But then, Joe Dispenza is not a real doctor-- he's a chiropractor. (For more on that, search for ""chirobase"". Maybe our ""suffering fools gladly"" is why Americans spend twice as much on health care as the British but have worse health.)"
5,An excellent example of what science could be...,"This movie continues where ""What the ""Bleep"" - the first movie started. It uses interviews, examples and animation to explain deep scientific phenomenon and attempts to show linkage between the science and the metaphysical. It taxes the mind in an effort to have you conceive of the world of many possibilities which, after all, is the basic premise of Quantum Physics.If you have a mind that needs or desires a little stretching then here is something which will accommodate that..."
5,Our Thoughts are Powerful,"This documentary is the perfect blend of science with a dash of mysticism. It explains the importance of conciousness and quantum physics by showing how important our thoughts are because of the effects they have on ourselves and the world.It has interviews with various scholars, scientists, and mystics whos idenity is not revealed until the end of the documentary so that you can hear what they say before you make a judgement on who they are. That right there shows how important your thoughts are because once you judge someone, you see them through that thought pattern or lens that you have chosen for them.It follows this deaf lady around and shows how these theories apply to daily life. The animations in the film are also very entertaining.I hope this has been helpful.Peace and Blessings on you journey..."
2,Why the bleep did I sit through this?,"There are parts of this 'movie' that are intriguing and actually based in Quantum Theory. Unfortunately, the writers use that as little more than a launch pad to promote a lot of unfounded metaphysical gobbledy-gook. It is, ultimately, just another version of ""The Secret"" only with the audacity to tie it to Quantum Theory.The opening sequences give an elementary intro to Quantum Theory which leads the viewer to assume that it will be an easily digestible exploration of complex theories and how they may engender a greater understanding of our place in the Universe. This hope is unfortunately unrealized as the movie then takes you through a repetitive series of 'interviews' with people who are already invested in metaphysical beliefs that have no basis in science.It's enticing at first, but ultimately audacious and disappointing. Go with the movie ""Mindwalk"" if you want something philosophically based in Quantum Theory that doesn't digress into make-believe."
1,Awful,"I don't know what the bleep WE know, but I know this film was an utter waste of time. 0 Stars. I could not wait for it to end. There is absolutely no science value in it.While new agers will probably love it, rational persons, or anyone interested in quantum physics will find this is an exercise in agony. Especially galling is that the promotional material baits the hook with the lure of actual science, but delivers a close encounter of aromatherapy-the dog poop kind."
1,"Beware, Not A Real Movie!",This is not a movie about quantum physics. It is a movie length ADVERTISEMENT for Ramtha.I went to the theatre thinking that I was going to find something informative and walked out 1/2 of the way through. I demanded my money back. Why should I have to pay to see an advertisement? The movie is long enough that Ramtha should pay you to see it.The theatre refused to refund my money. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Do not shell out any of your hard earned money for an advertisement.
1,"WORST ""MOVIE"" EVER","This movie was absolutely the worst thing I have ever been forced to watch in my life. It made ABSOLUTELY zero sense. The plot is completely weird and disturbing. Some of the philosophy is credible, but I completely missed anything philosophical because I was so distracted by the ridiculous plot containing ""dancing blobs"" and other unbelievably stupid things. Do not watch it unless you want to be bored and frustrated out of your mind."
1,Great Product But>>>>>,"Great Tutorial But....Purchased the Professor Teaches... based on three reviews. This is a fine tutorial but does not run on Windows Vista, at least not on my Ultimate Program. The tutorial instructs to click here, drag this, or type that. Well sometimes it works and sometimes the red arrow pops up and says, ""here dummy."" So you repeat the prompted response and get scolded again. One can extricate themselves from this catch 22 by clicking options and then next, but when it happens every 3 or 4 pages it looses its sex appeal. Will try PC Tutor next.TGP"
5,Professor Teaches Windows Vista,"Professor Teaches are excellent training tools. This CD set includes three CDs and covers Windows Vista Home Basics , Vista Business , Vista Ultimate , Vista Home Premium , Windows XP Professional , Windows XP Home."
4,A Very Good Learning Tool,"Nice product, easy to use. Very good learning tool. A must have for Vista users."
1,a waste of money,This item won't function properly and I ended up throwing it into garbage. You can get a well functioning item at Walmart store for close price.
3,Pretty Nice,Nice cd to have if you wish to spend a quiet evening with the lady or man of your choice.
5,Enjoyable CD,"Stanley Black and his orchestra originally recorded these albums for London Phase 4 Stereo. I had SPAIN on LP and thoroughly enjoyed it, Speaking only of the SPAIN album the remastering onto CD was brilliantly done. The selections are beautifully played and the sound is superior, without the surface noise that I think interfered with the sound of the orchestra on the vinyl LP. The TANGOS album is great for Spanish background music and SPAIN is very enjoyable on CD. This album is worth having for the sheer great sound, and in general for enjoying."
3,A warning to non-British readers,"A warning to non-British readers.This book assumes a British readership in it's use of language and assumptions.pros:* It's a mushroom cookbook!* decent advise on storing and preparing mushrooms* pretty pictures - each recipe has it's own picturecons:* assumes a British readership - many terms will be unfamiliar to Americans.* some ingrediants will be somewhat unavailable to Americans - like ""yeast extract"" (which is apparently what Marmite is)* many recipies do not have a mushroom focus. A grotesque example is steak with a SINGLE mushroom placed on top* very few kinds of mushrooms are discussed. There are many types of mushrooms that are easy for me to find that are not discussed at all. (for example: Portabello, Enoki, various dried Chinese mushrooms)"
1,"This is 1 packet, not 8!","Don't be fooled with this product, they are clearly advertising this to include 8 packets, but in all actuality it only comes with one. You can imagine how disappointed I was when the shipment came in such a small box, when I was expecting 8x the amount I ordered. Shady... Go elsewhere."
1,not what it seems,"It is called ""Spiru-tein Shake - strawberry - 8 - packet"", and that makes me think it's 8 packets...well it's only one. So don't be fooled."
4,Carefree,"Jason Olcese's freshman set has a great resemblance to Jack Johnson's work. Mostly, we have Jason singing rhythmic & melodic compositions with his gentle voice backdropped against acoustic strumming & guitar riffs. Problems with the set include the similarity of song style and arrangement that often makes the tracks blend; although taken individually, they are pretty good. The title track has some nice guitar playing, ""Why don't I leave this woman? I've asked myself that question time and time again."" ""The Campfire Song"" has a nice carefree feel, ""You've gotta let go & do some dancing."" Perhaps homage to Nebraska, ""Stuck in North Platte"" coaxes the toe to tap. ""Cherry on Top"" has a catchy tune with Amanda Vilzakovitch's guest vocals adding vocal variety. ""Stay"" & ""Do-C-Do"" are both nice tracks. O has a gentle tender sound that charms even as it perhaps serves as an adult lullaby. Enjoy!"
2,Not great,"This story had potential - but if fell way too short. It was more involved with sex - should I, I want him to, can't she's my witness - which took up about 5/8 of the book. The other 3/8 of the book - protecting a federal witness, was good. Too bad she didn't put more into that end of the story. Way too much focus on the sex. Not my ""cup of tea""."
4,Buen Disco De Navidad,Los temas de merengue y plenas son buenos y los de salsa regular. Esperemos algo mejor la proxima vez.
1,Making Lindsay Lohan look bad,"look how bad you made lindsay look with this stupid piece of trash. it is not beautiful, nor a good example. this right here is an example of trashing a beautiful celebrity. take this stupid thing a put it in the trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,this doll is ugly!!!!,people who said that this doll is pretty is way of track this doll is so ugly!!!! it looks the newer version of chuckies bride !!!! linsey lohan was better off making her own doll but i am not trying to be mean.
1,SO ugly,"this THING is so stupid. i bought it at a garage sale for a quarter and i make my bratz (which are BEA U TI FUL) beat her up. i ripped the stupid loser's head off and i stick needles through it. and i ripped her body apart. ( :D ) i throw her into the wall, and i make her bleed with my red gellpen. (HAHA!) IT IS SO FUN! i make my bratz may lin (i named her mayoko) shoot her with the wild wild west gun for bratz. i also make my bratz horse kick her and stomp on her. so as you can tell bratz rock and my scene sucks and also, lindsey lohan sucks.(i am a girl of course)"
5,ILIKE HER!,I think that this doll is very pretty because i went to the shops and i saw her.This the only my scene doll i like because she has a pretty look and nice clothes.I really want so can make her a celeb for my bratz.one more thing all myscene and bratz rule!P.S myscene and bratz should have a movie together and they should work together.
4,"I don't like Lindsay, but this doll is gorgeous!","This is one of the best M.S dolls *EVER*! She is very beautiful,and she comes with a lovely outfit! I think My Scene/doll fans would love her!"
5,~~~~~**********THANK YOU CHELSEA CHURRO!! **********~~~~~,"CHELSEA CHURRO IS THE ONE WHO MADE ME RRREEEAAALLLYYY WANT THIS DOLL, AND GUESS WHAT? I GOT THE DOLL AND I LOVE IT!! THE CLOTHES ARE VERY PRETTY,VERY COOL! SHE LOOKS LIKE LINDSAY LOHAN TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY SCENE GOES HOLLYWOOD!

OVERALL THIS IS A GORGEOUS DOLL!!!!!! ~~~~***** I LOVE MY SCENE!!! :) :) =)- - MXL = )"

I come to my cousins once every 2 months and use this to communite my opinion openingly, to everyone of whom shall read my reveiws. and i see my name (and my review for another fashiondoll) being used moraly to seek the attention you are not getting. i shall suggest to you, to use your own name, and not mine. Forever Alex"
5,Lindsay lohan is my fav actress,I dont have her but i saw her at my toys r us im a big lindsay lohan fan i have all her movies my fav is parent trap and mean girls. I saw lindsay lohan i thought she wont come out in stores for a long time. i thought she looked just like her loved her outfits wish i would have bought her but when the dvd comes out on the 30 im so getting her and the dvd.
1,SO UGLY (IM BACK),"yeah, im wierd but sorry what i said about the lindsey lohan doll. i hate her so much but the truth is: i don't even have her, i just wanted to see how people would react to my review called SO UGLY. listen, i still think bratz are WAY better than my scene but, i do own a few my scenes and they are a little pretty. now, it is true that my scene copied of of bratz, so that is why some people hate them. what i think is: the my scenes are fans of bratz. so i like to make my my scenes and bratz friends. they live in peace. : ) (no ripping heads off)"
1,And I thought the My Scene girls were wholesome :|,"Lindsay Lohan; one of the pop industries biggest sluts, and what does Mattell do? Make a doll out of her.I truly find this pathetic... I mean what's next a Britney Spears my scene?Everybody says the Bratz are ""whores"" and ""sluts"", but I've seen some really trampy my scene dolls too (this one included; also the Masquerade Madness Dream Genie Delancy; her clothes are see through and her entire mid-drift is showing).To sum it up, if Bratz are tramps, so is my scene... I mean come on people, My Scene copied Bratz and they wear similar clothes! If Bratz are sluts, the My Scene girls are too!"
1,Same girl that wrote Creepy,"Now, I do think that the Hillary Duff doll and those other dolls look kinda ugly too. And Bratz dolls are better. They are prettier and better then My Scene dolls. And you know what, if I think it is ugly, then I think it is ugly. You know it is ugly too. You just want to like everything My Scene. Like those terribly ugly tall ones. This doll is ugly. Cased Closed."
3,!,this doll is prettyno she is notyes she isnope she looks like an ugly freckle face who looks nothing at all like lindsay lohanyes she doesno she doesn'tYES SHE DOES!
3,This is... Absolutely Scary,"Now don't get me wrong, I am a My Scene fan. Like all celebrity dolls I've seen, this one is creepy, even though it looks better than most celebrity dolls out there. Maybe I'd get her for her accessories, dress, and the skirt once she goes on clearance. By then, they will only have the ugly ones left(they all do look different) and my sister or I will have given it a makeover or something."
1,My Scene teaches girls too,"Umm... hello, My Scene fans go to Bratz dolls a lot too and say mean things about Bratz dolls. So what does My Scene dolls teach you, huh? How to be mean, how to have a boyfriend at really young age, how to have a boring life, and how to be fake. Bratz teach you that your friends are really important (there are at least 20 Bratz girls, that is a lot of friends) and that you should be yourself. Bratz dolls rule and My Scene drule. If you don't believe me, look at this ugly My Scene Linsey Lohan doll (they made it possible to make something from pretty to ugly) and look at all the other My Scene dolls, they look terribly ugly."
1,"TO THAT WOMAN WHO ""PLAYS"" WITH DOLLS","WHAT KIND OF A FREAK ARE YOU? YOU ARE MIDDLE AGED AND PLAY WITH DOLLS? GET A LIFE YOU RETARD, UR A FREAK, AND SOMETHING MUST HAVE GONE WRONG WHEN YOU WERE BORN TO MAKE YOU SUCH A FREAK"
5,BEST CELEBRITY DOLL ON EARTH,"I so want this doll. She is like the perfect celebrity doll. All the Barbie doll celebs look ugly. I can't imagine a Bratz celebrity doll. Anyway, this doll is beautiful. I wasn't sure if I liked Lindsay Lohan's character, but I'm sure the new My Scene movie will change my mind. This doll has 2 fabulous outfits and apparently a 3rd t-shirt. She has tons of hollywood accessories just like the other My Scene dolls in this series. You should get her. She's a collecter doll well worth the price. This is your 1 and only chance to get this doll."
2,2.5 pounds each.,"I'll admit that I could have read the product description a little better, but to be honest there was no obvious description of whether this was 2-2.5 pound weights or 2-5 pound weights. I went to multiple sites and nowhere did it specify whether ""the pair"" was 5 pounds or whether it was ""a pair"" of 5 pound weights.Well, it's a combined weight of 5 pounds, and if you have the foresight to check the shipping weight that will make it clear.The other thing is these don't fit well on wrists, which is what I specifically purchased them for. I wanted weights that would allow hand mobility when running on the treadmill, this doesn't really cut it. By the nature of the design you can't get them that snug so they jostle around on your arm when running, they are also bulky as hell.There might be an alternative out there, but if you are looking for some wrist weights I'd look somewhere else."
3,Functional Product,"The thumb grip is a nice addition but the weights are a little loose on the wrist. Perhaps a ring to tension the velcro on would ensure a snug fit. Aside from that design quirk, they work and provide good resistance without injury. They work better as ankle weights but are adequate for wrist weights if erratic movements are minimized."
2,Not as good,Was not what you would expect from the Goodman's. Was really disappointed overall. Figure it had to be from when they first started out. Would have liked to hear at least part of 1 song before I purchased the CD
5,Learn English,This book is very helpful for who wants to know the difference between Italian and English grammar.
3,Too complication,This is very complicated really and not good as a review for a struggling student. I think Italian for Dummies is a better fit for someone who buys this because they need extra help.
3,The uncrowned queen,"Besse Smith's legacy lives on in Chaka Khn, Aretha, and Mary J. Blige, but these artist are reaping the rewards that this woman sacrificed for. It's ad there isn't a more in-depth look into the life of Bessie Smith. This book is good, but it's mostly for a junior high school student who could benefit greatly by reading this book.It was okay."
4,What a treat,"THIS is the Mike nelson I love (see Death Rat for the other Mike Nelson). Perfect easy reading fodder for airplanes, waiting rooms, bathrooms. Dry wit with minor cynicism"
3,"Funny, but....","Mike's first solo effort ""Megacheese"" was so hilarious that his new bok can't quite compare. While parts are funny, they are not ""laugh out loud funny"" like Megacheese. Some parts seemed more like leftover Dave Barry bits."
4,"Funny,sharp,witty","As a MST3K fan, I have been enjoying Mike Nelson's sharp,acerbic wit for years. But even non-Msties will love MInd Over Matters. It pokes fun at the mundane,ridiculous, and sometimes absurd aspects of modern American life. I especially enjoyed the chapters in wich he describes following his wife around to discover her secrets to making so many friends, and reading to his young sons at bedtime."
4,"some very funny stuff, some not","There are passages in this book that got me hyperventilating with laughter, like ""A Very Unhealthy Club"" and ""Rethinking the Backside"".There are also quite a few passages that seem forced, where Mike is trying too hard to show how learned he is (his modesty is a little disingenuous--its clear he's very intelligent).Still, the laughs were cathartic. And the intelligence is welcome."
5,Satirical essays of exceptional hilarity,"Michael J. Nelson is best known as the host and head writer of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" While I take a back seat to no one in my affection for MST3K, I hope that browsers unfimiliar with the show will give Mr. Nelson a chance as this is as funny as anything that I have read in years. He writes exceptionally well and has a comedic sensibility reminiscent of Woody Allen or Robert Benchley with a soupcon of classic MAD magazine and Stan Freberg thrown in. This is very highly recommended. Even on rereading various essays my laughter remains undeminished. Great to throw in a bag and take on a trip."
3,IS THIS AS FUNNY AS AN EPISODE OF MST3K?,"No, but I did find myself laughing out loud now and then. I believe these columns were publsihed in a newspaper local to Mike and he has collected them here. This is not a book to read in one sitting, but there are some great observations hidden inside. I did find myself hearing the book in my head in Mike's voice, though. I wonder if someone who has never heard of MST3K will enjoy this as much as those of us in the ""know""."
2,I think that they call this over-sharing,"Hmmm. You know, Mike, after reading this book I am struck wondering if perhaps the best course of action in the future is to not write in detail every single thought you have. Maybe cull it down a bit. Maybe make a list of ten things that annoy you, and write about one of them.From Red Zone Cuba to ""I don't like toast""."
3,"Fun, but Not Quite Satisfying","I love Mike Nelson's writing - the style of his delivery onscreen translates seemlessly to the printed page, which is a tribute to his talent. Overall, I found ""Mind Over Matters"" to be a fun read. This book is a collection of essays that run the gamut of subject matter, from the decidedly bankrupt world of men's fashion to Nelson's own difficulties in musical theater, and many of them are genius (one I particularly love is his imagining what it would be like to be on Inside the Actor's Studio); however, there are some that just plain fall flat, a symptom (it seems) of overworking some jokes to death, and then kicking them over and over. For fans of Mike Nelson, this will no doubt be a treat. Those who enjoyed his novel, ""Death Rat,"" will find much to enjoy here, as I did. Recommended."
3,"cute...but it's no ""Movie Mega-Cheese""","It's a cute book with a couple of clever pieces, but nothing near the laugh level found in ""Movie Mega-Cheese"""
5,Book good!,"Mike Nelson is a very funny fellow, all right? And that's all you really need to know. So buy this book if you know what's good for you, and I'm not just saying that because he is a rather large fellow who could easily pound me into the ground with those big beefy mits of his if he so desired. I hope I've made my point."
5,excellent,"This book is my bible with regards of software architecture. In previous S.E. courses, I heard about software architecture, but the notion never quite sank on my skull; perhaps because the notion itself required a course on itself, or in this case, a book. A minor problem is that the book does not use UML; however, the diagrams the authors use are easy to understand. More importantly, I find the narrative is as good as the diagrams themselves. I almost never have to look at the diagrams to understand the notions. Tumbs up to the authors!"
4,A must read if you are serious about software architecture.,"Likes,The articulation of the Architecture Business Cycle (ABC), a theme that runs through-out the book. The ABC is a holistic view of the business environment, architecture, the architect, and the development organisation.Discussions on Architecture Style.An overview of a Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM) for assessing the suitability of a candidate architecture.Numerous and insightful cases studies including, AE7-Avionics System, WWW, CORBA, air traffic control, flight simulation, and command-and-control systems.Dislikes,In digestible tables and check-lists.No cases studies from the financial environment.

4,...And they REFUSE to do a reunion show. Tsk.,"Classic Lillingtons punk goodness. I keep vowing, ""Ok. I'm going to change the CD's in my car out today--time for a change."" And then ""The Too Late Show"" just winds up right back in there. Love the hooky, distinctly Lillingtons punk sound and the equally signature ""comic book fodder"" lyrics. A really good album."
4,Proflex Review,"This machine is crafted like a tank, took 15 min to assemble with no trial and error what so ever. Some of the best instructions and workmanship I have seen. They even included actual wrenches to do the job. The exercises are great and the machine delivers.The only reason I held back from 5 stars is the following.1. The machine shows to be white in color but I was shipped a dark Grey color.2. The instruction sheet on how to do the exercises is scant, and the very short videos on the website are to much of a pitch for the machine. Now it does not take a rocket scientist to do a stretch, but I think for the price they are charging they should include a video and have more in deph stretching on the website and include guidelines on how often to perform the exercises and what kind of degree gain you should be shooting for."
4,Custom Assembly Furniture,"The ""Step One Collection"" from South Shore Furniture has renewed my faith in ""put-together"" furniture. Not as if I will be rushing to replace my all wood bedroom furniture or anything, however, for an additional piece now an again; this line of ""put-together"" furniture delivers hands down. It assembles into a relatively sturdy and reliable piece of furniture that looks stylish and functions well. I assembled it alone in two hours working at a comfortable pace, although it would have been nice to have an extra set of hands. In the future when furniture needs arise, South Shore's ""One Step Collection,"" will be my first stop."
4,Good quality,I really love this armoire. It's perfect for me because I needed something with shelves so I could put all my shirts shorts and jeans into one thing. I got tired of using a regular dresser and went for something with shelves. It was a little tough towards the end finishing up putting it together but I had to do it on my own. So that could be why. But this product really is everything that I was hoping for. I highly recommend it.
4,Good looking armoire,"The assembly was not hard, just time consuming. I completed 90% of it on my own, with just a little help near the end.We are actually using this for a pantry cabinet, because we wanted something that wouldn't be an eye-sore in the dining room. This works perfectly for that purpose. The door operates smoothly and the doored area has the dividers that make organizing the pantry a much easier job. I just put in some shelves in the back of the areas I am using for cans and I can see the contents much better, since it is so deep.We did buy extra felt pieces for the bottom to ensure it doesn't scratch our wood floor as we weren't sure the ones it came with would be adequate. I do like that it came with the marker to fix any blemishes. We didn't have any upon shipment, but with a house full of kids, I am sure we will at some point."
2,Disappointed,"Uninteresting. Very detailed about fashion designers, the wealthy, and famous people of the time. Goes very indepth about people and events most of us have never heard of. Not a very fun read."
2,biased biography,"The biographer's research is incomplete. Example: although it is claimed that Chanel was devoted to her business designing women's clothes, no one is interviewed who actually worked with Chanel. The business was abruptly shut down by Chanel after her employees went on strike in the late 30's. The single tidbit the author provides is that one of Chanel's employees, who had been with her since the infancy of her store, quit when Chanel refused to give her a raise. Many of the employees openly wept when they learned that this devoted employee was gone. Chanel took up with an officer in the german army during WWII. Was she a collaborator with the Petain government ??? Did she benefit from her cooperation with the germans during the war? The author is interested in presenting Chanel as a likeable person. I wonder how accurate this is."
4,"Fascinating book, full of details and historically correct.","This book was extremely interesting to read. Considering Chanel's habbit of often lying about her past, many biographers had given up on trying to tell her story. That's probably why the book lacks reasoning behind certain facts of her life, although the author did the best he could to provide his own viewpoint about some of the unenswered questions. The book is wonderful and it leaves the reader with plenty of room to use his/her own imagination to reveal some of the mysteries behind Chanel's great genious."
2,Chanel book review,"I agree with the other 2 reviewers. This book is very difficult to follow and the author jumps from character to character and topic to topic too frequently. The pictures are nice, but I feel the author could have done a better job at creating more excitement and interest for the reader."
2,Boring,"I was very interested in reading about Chanel's life, her work and her clothing. This book was a recounting of a bunch of facts, the people who were around her and very little on what Chanel really did in the design field. She stayed in bed until noon, and yet she worked very hard at her business? It didn't quite tell what she did at her business, and that is what I really wanted to read about. I had to force myself to continue reading as I found it extremely boring."
3,Convoluted Chanel!,"We chose ""Chanel: A Woman of Her Own"" for our bookclub. The life story of Chanel is very, very interesting. However, I found that the rather convoluted style of writing by this author made it hard to read. I found myself often reading a sentence over again several times simply to discern what the author was trying to say. I believe there must be other biographies of Chanel out there that are better!"
1,Not for grand ams.,Doesn't fit the rear speaker connectors at all. I had to rig it to make it work. But after some cutting it works.
2,does not fit a Chevy Metro,Amazon's system says this harness fits a Chevy Metro. It's wrong. 72-4500 (Metra GM Speaker Wire Harness Adapter (72-4500) (DW-4500SH)) looks like the correct harness for a Metro.
1,boooo,this dressing room is a piece of crap!! i hate my scene. i luv bratz! some of the reviews cant even spell daughter right! their stupid like my scene!! lil bratz even have their own high school! HA HA. my scene will never win never!!!from Lindsay bratz lover and my scene hater ha ha ha
3,pretty cool,It's not the BEST but it is pretty nice. I LOVE the giant make up mirrors! i think thats the coolest thing about this toy!
1,I agree with Lindsey 100%,"Bratz dolls are way better then My Scene dolls. They are ugly and dumb. and the My Scene copied Brazt 2 from this collection.1. the Bratz had a hollywood thing first2. And the My Scene dolls did something that made them famous, and the Bratz did something that made them famous first.So this thing sucks. I know because my best friend got it, and everything wsn't going right. Everything kept falling and stuff. So don't get this. Bratz are better."
5,Stop Talking Crap when you don't even have the toy!,"A lot of people criticize My Scene because they try to compete with Bratz and copy them (or may be bratz copies my scene) but What I'm trying to say is, if all those people make bad reviews hate this my scene, why would they even buy it. Either they are dumb or trying to waste money to destroy their my scene toy. Anyway, they don't have this my scene toy and they're just trying to criticize this my scene toy.I'm not trying to criticize Bratz or My Scene, I'm just trying to make peace.As the stupid phrase goes. ""END THIS STUPID, DUMB DOLLY WAR""UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN, BUSTERS!you better!~some kid down the street""The world is quiet here"" V.F.D."
4,gallons of egg white,bitt expensive for avg ppl but its an goood product..the best part is quck and potent with protein ..protein that burns out quickly
2,iffy on this,"liquid egg white shipped to your door. hum its not bad tasting but im not sure if i like the thought of it, i"
3,good learning tool,"This seems to be a good learning tool but my 2yr does not like them as well as some other Barney dvds she has already. She loses interest more quickly.Several of the dvds have problems with the volume. They go down real low for no reason and you can hardy hear them, then go just back to where you had the volume.I would not buy this product again."
4,We love this,My baby just love watching this even though she doesn't have a clue to what's its about.It's a must seen.
5,keeps my 2 1/2 yr old entertained,First movie purchased on my Kindle. My toddler really like Barney and pets so this is perfect for my family .
5,great deal,Great purchase. We have a 2 year old who loves barney. She is going to be a very happy little girl
5,AWESOME !,"These videos are awesome! My daughter is 1 1/2 and loves the songs and dancing and she wants to watch them every morning. She has started to memorize some of the songs and when shes in a bad mood all i have to do is start singing one of them and she cheers up instantly! They teach colors and shapes adn numbers, and you can't go wrong with a 6 pack variety!"
3,Barney,"We bought this Barney collection for our young ones (5,3,1) and they love it. It has enough DVD's that even if they watch one a day, it does not seem overly repetitive. The one thing I will say is that the show is a bit dated. I do not feel it impacts the content much. My kids love the ""Spanish"" feature and will often ask me to play it in Spanish. ot sure why hehehe. We bought this collection with our family Amazon account. It really was a decent value."
3,"great but, one will not play",the dvds are fantastic some a rewind of my childhood. However one dvd will not even play. It would cost me more to send it back than it cost for the one dvd itself.
5,Great Educational Tool,"My 2 1/2 year old twin granddaughters love these DVD's. They would watch them all day long, if I let them. They are learning so many things including their numbers and letters and how to be a good person. I would recommend them to any family that loves Barney."
5,Catchy songs - cute episodes!,"The songs are cute and entertaining for my toddler (although, the songs will tend to be stuck in your head for days). The Barney episodes are colorful, engaging, and entertaining for little kids. I would highly recommend this episode if your toddler likes animals, especially cats and dogs!"
4,It was worth the 13.00 i paid for it.,"This was a good Rookie Debut effort. Frankie J has great vocal abilities he could blow Rickie Martin and J Lo away in a second. He shines the most on his ballads. I can see him being a stability in this industry. He's a cross between Jon B and Brain Mcknight to me. The best songs on this albulm are dont wanna try,wont change,be home soon, and diggin your style, and drinks on me."
4,This album is tiiiight....,I wasnt sure if this was one for the collection or as many would be downloading. But after peeping a few songs on the album...i am feeling Frankie rip it up on this album . The slow jamz speak volumes in terms of relating to many love issues on a universal basis. As a guy ... i can feel for him ... must say this is one for all guys who have gone through that really bad breakup. But for them ladies who can see that love is so harsh in many ways. Nice album....Smooth voice... Lyrics that flow ... Feeling it... Check it out for yourself...
5,Pricy and needs a better spout.,"This stuff is a necessary evil if you have a limited slip.Once installed, the benefit was obvious.However, I would design the spout differently. Its easiest to install differential fluids by using a rubber hose and just tilting the bottle on end.The spout on this bottle does not allow for the attachment of a rubber hose. I had to squirt it into the hole and it was a mess.I guess an alternative would be to mix it with the differential oil before putting it in the differential, but my differential was already full of oil.Good product, but why not put a cone spout on the bottle?"
2,Doesn't look like picture didn't like background color,"It's not a very pretty back ground green ,it would look great if the background was white.... Very very disappointed"
4,Casta Diva - Romamticized Biography of Belini,"The brief life of Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835) is in wonderful 98 minutes film from the days he was a student in Naples to the openning of his famous opera ""Norma"". The film is with full of his beautiful music. Acting is excellent and the direction is good."
5,Servicing for my M3,"The Bentley manuals have always been the best and I have always bought a new one whenever I have changed cars (BMW). The only thing I am disappointed in is the E46 was also made and sold in 2006, and this manual, nor does any Bentley manual, cover this year for my 2006 M3."
5,BMW 3Series Service Manual,"Excellent service manual for the backyard mechanic, with the help of this manual you are able to do a lot of little things to your BMW that need repaired and save $$$$$$$$$$$$$ instead of having to take it to the BMW service department.."
2,Not worth the investment!,"While the images are cleaner and easier to see than my Haynes Repair Manual, the information is very disappointing. I expected the Bentley's to be as authoritative and comprehensive as my Honda Service Manual (of which I've owned 2), but no. I'm amazed that such a large volume contains such limited information. My best information has come from the Haynes Repair Manual & searches on the internet."
1,Bwm manual is not what I expected,The instructions for how to remove some interior pieces was incorrect and I damaged a part because I followed thise instructions.I do not trus this manual now
3,it helps but its not eny better then the cheaper books,it covers the basic i could not find how to remouve the ccv valve on 3series bmw with this book it t whent to the macanick to price for what it is
3,Somewhat helpful,"I was looking for a more descriptive book on my '03 330i. Although it is very thorough, it appears to try to appeal to many users of many vehicle types in the 3 series family. I expected a bit more user friendly steps. You really need to know what you're into here. My opinion, if you need this book, you probably need professional car repair help."
5,Bentley manual is a must have!,"Take the guess work out of working on your car. This manual tells you everything you need to know, making tough jobs much simpler."
5,BEST AUTO REPAIR BOOK EVER BMW,"AFTER OWNING COUNTLESS AUTOMOBILES AND PURCHASING REPAIR MANUALS THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER OWNED. GREAT PICTURES, GREAT INSTRUCTIONS, EVERYTHING NEEDED IS THERE. IF THEY MAKE THIS BOOK FOR YOUR CAR ITS THE ONLY ONE TO PURCHASE. BETTER THAN THE MANUFACTURES REPAIR MANUAL"
4,a must,If you own a Bemmer you have to have a Bentley. . . or thousands of dollars to pay your mechanic. . . seriously i have two modles of BMW and a Bently for each. Both BMWs came with a stack of invoices that cost the last owners $$$$$ that could have been saved.Nooo other manual compares to this.
4,satisfied,"Generally, this book provide a good detail in step.Almost half of its thickness is from logical electric diagram, which is, in my opinion, useless.didn't provide the color of wire.call connector in code which unable to determine exact location.didn't provide information like each wire's name or function.should have information on self diag by symtom."
2,Missing a section!,"Great book, got it as a present for my husband's birthday. Sadly it's missing a section - 119 and 120. I did not expect it from a book that came so highly recommended by a number of our friends who are BMW owners. If it weren't for a missing chapter, I would have given this book 5 stars."
4,"Leaves a little to be desired, but useful nonetheless","If you are hoping for a lot of useful diagnostic routines and detailed illustrations, like a factory service manual, you will not find it in this book. What you will find is a lot of instruction for replacing components assuming you know that the component needs to be replaced. So, in that sense it is very useful. It just isn't as useful as the OEM manuals I have had for previous cars. I was expecting that since in the past I would have 2-3 volumes for one specific model and year, whereas this book has one volume for the entire generation, including the M3 model."
5,"Favorite children's author, fab book","My niece loves all of her books by Karen Beaumont and so do I. The books give a great message, but the words are fun to say. The illustration is also fun with great bright colors. Tom Boy or Girly Girl...you'll love this book!!! Aint Gonna Paint is another title by Beaumont that we love. The rest are good also, but these two are the best."
5,Wonderful esteem builder!!!,"As a mother of two who teaches, and received a bachelor's degree in literature, this is one of the first children's books I have come across that I can recommend without reservation. Even though the story is about a girl, my sons love it! It's wonderfully illustrated, and when we read it, we giggle at the pictures and the silly ideas. The best thing about this book is that through the silliness the words reinforce a message about self-esteem that cannot be repeated enough! They love it, I love it!"
2,Subliminal jail message,"I really liked this book until i got to the part ""I like me wild, I like me tame"" with the illustration of jail bars and jail key lock. I'm sure that the illustrator didn't even think about the implication. But because of the over incarceration of African Americans I am concerned about the subliminal message it sends. Because there are so few regular children's/youth books that depict pictures/images of African American children, it's a shame that this one is marred by that illustration. I know it seems touchy or paranoid to some and it may be, but being a prosecutor who sees almost exclusively African American boys and men incarcerated I may be a bit touchy or paranoid."
3,Good book wis I read it more often,"This s a good book but I did not read it as often to my students and during independent reading my students did not chose ths book to be read to them as much as the other books I reviewed. However, I do like ths book and kudos goes to the art work very colorful and attractive."
3,I love the illustrations.,"The pictures in this book are bouncy, vivid - just delightful.The text, unfortunately...There's nothing wrong about it, or bad about it. It just is a very basic, very solid ""self-esteem is good"" book. Banal, bland... maybe a little boring.This is made all the worse by the artwork, which is so not boring and banal and bland that it shows up the words even worse.Oh well."
1,Not Appropriate for Traumatized Children,"I wish that one of the earlier reviews of this book had mentioned the fact that many of the illustrations are almost surrealistic, distorting the image of the little girl in semi-grotesque ways. While these pictures might be viewed as humorous or silly by typically developing kids(?), I had purchased the book to use with young traumatized children who generally find these kinds of distortions to be disturbing and frightening. I had been looking for good picture books with positive images of children of color, but due to these illustrations, will not be able to use this title."
5,Review from Books That Heal Kids,"This book is a WINNER with kids. They ooooh, awww, and GIGGLE over the illustrations. I'm oooohing, awwing, and giggling right along with them. Other book reviews have commented that the illustrations are Dr. Seuss-ish. I adore the spunky, joyful, smiley little girl in this book. The kids bounce with anticipation with the approach of every turned page. The inside jacket of the book says, ""At once silly and serious, this exuberant ode to self-esteem is sassy, soulful-and straight from the heart."" SO TRUE! Oh, and you will also love her darling little dog - her self-esteem side kick."
5,Great for transracially adopted kids!,"I just happened to see this book at our local library and loved it so much that I ordered it online. As a white mother of a transracially adopted part African-American girl, I am so thrilled to see this character who likes herself just the way she is. My 4 year old LOVES this book and asks me to read it again and again. She particularly loves when the little girl wakes up with crazy hair and again, she STILL loves herself! Good message for ALL kids though, not targeted at the adoption crowd."
4,Nicholas From Richview Middle School,"Two of the main characters are Nancy Emerson and Rose. Nancy Emerson is missing the wensday before Thanksgiving. Rose is a girl who met Nancy Emerson and stated she was scared and sad. The story begans with Nancy Emerson disappering Wensday Before thanksgiving. Jerram roses little brother said ""No need to think about death anymore."" The long saige of The Christmas Killer was over."
3,Book not in good condition,"As a librarian, I was disappointed with the condition of the book, especially the cover, for the price charged. I would not have rated the book in ""good"" condition with all the writing on the verso of the covers."
2,If only I'd gotten THIS item...,"Twice I have tried to order a bowl to replace cracked ones. (They crack very easily, and are ridiculously huge, too big to put in the dishwasher comfortably). Twice I have receieved some other Pfaltzgraff product (at least these weren't broken), in another design. I am through trying to replace this bowl."
3,OK,"The chain was very nice, but it didn't last long. It lasted for about a month before breaking at the clasp."
5,Very good,I recommend this to anyone who is thinking of writing an autobiography or a biography. It is awesome.
5,a must for water resource engineers and students,"I took a hydrology course taught by one of the authors (Larry Mays) using this book. Advantages of this book lies in (1) the arrangement of the contents is very logic-oriented, you don't feel aburpt jump from one chapter to another one, (2) the theory addressed in the text is concise, easy to read and understand, (3) the examples used to illustrate the theories are very correlated. Other books may be good too, however, in terms of ""hydrology"" alone, I haven't seen a better one. It is a useful reference for your understanding of hydrologic design manual, creteria."
2,Run. Run Away.,"An album that simply doesn't work. The folks doing the voices are close enough for you to tell who they're SUPPOSED to be, but that's about all. Sylvester howling, ""It'th now or neverrrrr..."" was cute. If I had stopped the CD right there, I'da liked it. Unfortunately, the joke doesn't carry over for ten tracks."
1,ONLY LOVE KNOW,THIS MOVIE WAS HORIABLE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. THE STORY IS SLOW AND THE FILM MAKER JUST WANTS TO MAKE SOME MONEY ON THIS. NO MATTER IF IT IS .25
3,Nice Design,"This hook has a nice design, but the price is a bit high. The hook seems to have a high weight threshold. No bends yet, and the full backpack on it is heavy!"
2,Good book with some problems,"On the whole I found the book to be well balanced and insiteful. The text is quite readable and there is a degree of scholarship apparent. However, as a piece of non-fiction, it lacks a much needed index and list of sources. I received the book as a gift. I would not have bought it because of the lack of an index."
3,Beware Review of Those Who have not Read the Book,"One (or no) star reviews (and sometimes 5 star reviews) are to be looked upon with doubt. Some people who have not opened the book (look at a sample review here) simply use this forum to revile ideas they do not like. I read reviews to see how others felt about a book not to listen to the diatribe of a non-reader. I will admit I have not read this book and will not review its subject matter based upon a dust jacket reading. I wrote this because I was angered by what I perceive as a growing problem with such reviews. How 59 out of 95 readers or 10 out of 17 can say they found such a review ""helpful"" is beyond me! (N.B. Because the form forces me to rate the book I selected 3 stars as a mid-point)."
4,The Coming Catholic Church,"I found this book wonderfully thought-provoking. I agree with the author that the church needs change, and he presents the obstacles and challenges we as church will face in the coming years. Should be required reading for the laity in America, as well as our bishops, priests and seminarians."
4,"A balanced examination, crowned with hope","Gibson's evaluation of the current state of Roman Catholicism in the United States is something of a rarity in the world of contemporary Church discussion. Balanced, fair, and level-headed, he illustrates the impact the 2001 priest scandals have had on the faithful, but also touches on such phenomena as the shrinking number of clergy and religious, the disaffectedness of many of the faithful before, during, and after the scandals hit, and the effects various factions (left- and right-wingers, among others) have on what direction the Church is taking. Gibson's work, while delivering some sobering news, is nonetheless possessed of a sense of hope for a better future, as well as deep faith in what the Church means to Her many children. All in all an excellent and well-worth-reading examination of the current American Catholic Church."
5,Road Rage captures best of Great Big Sea,"Great Big Sea is a very popular band from Newfoundland, Canada who's fame and support continues to grow in other places as well. They play an exciting mix of traditional and original material that is heaped over with testosterone-driven male harmonies. In a world of over-produced studio albums by artists who's live show can never match their CD's this disc proves that there a still a few bands out there that have earned their following one show at a time.If you have never heard this band before, this album gives you a perfect place to start because it captures all the best qualities of Great Big Sea playing a selection of their best material all in one place. This CD will make you a fan...."
5,They just invited us to the party!,"This is one of the most fun CDs I've ever heard. Laughter and clapping from the audience just enhances the performance.And, all our favorite traditionals are there, ""When I'm Up,"" ""Night Paddy Murphy Died,"" ""Mari Mac."" Plus, we get some wonderful new compositions, such as ""Hanging Johnny.""The recording quality is great. Good sound on the band and the live sounds aren't staticky at all. Very much enjoyable."
5,Even Better Live,"This collection of live tracks is great and really showcases just how wonderful these guys are. I think my favorite is still The Night Pat Murphy Died, but there are so many other great tracks on here that you can't go wrong.If you've been looking for a good crossover band to introduce your friends to Celtic music, you can't go wrong with Great Big Sea and this is definitely their best album to date - it's good time music no matter what your favorite style."
5,This is my review of GBS...,"Being a Newfie, I was taken aback when I heard this band on a Saturday morning, way back when on KXCI, late 90's, early 2000, while I was 'painting my roof' in Tucson, AZ; I've been a fan ever since.The songs hit home for me as I remember my parents singing these songs on a Saturday night, drinking screech and playing cards with my aunts and uncles and older cousins. There's a good video called 'Celtic Tides', I believe, and it speaks of the music of the Maritime Providences of Canada, Ireland and Scotland; good stuff...I haven't gotten back to Newfoundland since we came to America; I want to re-visit my homeland someday, as well as County Waterford, Ireland, where we came from such a long time ago, before that damn bus hits me...erin go braugh...MPower..."
5,one of the best groups to be seen LIVE in concert,"Anyone who has gone to a GBS concert knows the energy, charisma, lyrical and purely East Coast sound that embodies this incredible group.This CD is just a taste of the liveliness that embodies any GBS concert. With all the great classics, my favorites being ""I'm a Rover"", ""The Night Patty Murphy Died"", and ""Lukey"", this is a CD that promises a brilliantly joyful time. This CD does them more justice than any of their other studio recorded discs... it is but a taste though, of the powerful essence of GBS that you capture with each and every concert."
4,MOVING,"Very powerfully, moving work. No, I can't imagine Pamela Sneed being more afraid of freedom than slavery! Pamela shared a wealth of feeling and sharing. She took us there...to see, feel,etc. This sistah is finally free!"
5,So cute!,I bought this in teacup for a really small pug puppy that I have. I was thankful for the review with the sizing listed. It is super cute on and does seem well made regardless of a few of the reviews. The body portion is double layered and the lace is sewn in tight. She's about to outgrow it and I will be purchasing a larger size.
3,okay at best,"the dress is cute but not true to size and cheaply made. i ordered xs and s - the normal sizes my dogs wear, the xs fits the s size dog. the threads were also not sewn in well... now i need to say more than i want to to get in 20 words. go figure."
4,Good harness,"Very cute. Fit my 2 lb chihuahua perfectly, with room to grow. Not that I want to put a dress on her. The leash D-ring on the outside makes it more useful. I wish they had a winter one."
4,RUNS VERY BIG see sizing below,the dress is cute. I got a small so my Pomeranian would be able to wear it when she gets bigger but this is still gonna be way to big. the tag that comes with it has this sizing chartTEACUP * <2 lbsXXS * 2-5 lbsXS * 5-15 lbsSMALL * 12-20 lbsI had to cut and alter to make it work for Jewels I hope this chart saves the hassle for someone else ♥
2,Too large,"The item was well made and cute as can be, but I ordered a small and received something that was more fitting for a medium size dog instead of the 3 pound poodle I had ordered it for."
5,So cute,This was an adorable item. Nicely packed and really is quality work. Material is strong and the concept worked perfectly for what I needed.
2,Dress is NOT exactly as pictured!,"What is pictured here is a beautiful, thick looking, high quality material that is well-made. What you get is a thin cheap material and poor looking design. It does not have the bright pink lace over the white lace. It is very light pink, and half the quality of the way it looks in this pic. After seeing this on here for a while, I wonder why it is that people give it anything more than one star. It is very plain looking in person, almost like a plain t-shirt. If it looked like the photo, I would love it! But it does not! I am promptly returning mine.VERY disappointed! False advertising due to their picture!!!"
3,RUNS LARGE BEWARE!,"XS in this brand says it is for dogs 5-15 lbs.I did not know that when ordering, so it was MUCH too large. Probably for dogs over 7 lbs.Quality is good- and adorable. I altered it and it fits a little better now-- if I had ordered it in the right size I would give it 5 stars.If your puppy is a princess you should get this for her-- it's adorable and when on my chihuahua looks like she's a ballerina w/ the lacey tutu part of it.Very cute- and nicely made.I like how it isn't extremely long like most doggy dresses so she can't scratch or chew on it. She can run and play with ease and although prefers her birthday suit- she seems to be comfortable wearing this."
2,Harness Dress,It does not fit like a extra small. It runs big. I'm going to have to send it back. But it is very pretty. It looks like the picture.
5,xxsmall yellow harness,I purchased the yellow xxsmall harness based on the reviews I read regarding the size of dog it fit. The harness is still to big for my little 1 lb dog so had to do some alterations and it fits great. I highly suggest this harnbess just for the cuteness factor.
3,Runs big,I read the persons review that it runs big but didn't realize how much bigger. The xxs was still to big for my 2.5 chihuahua puppy so be aware! Even tho it states on the tag 2-5 lbs so now having to order the teacup for less than 2 lbs. Even if i add velcro which I seriously thought about I will need to add about 2 inches and decided that at the neck that wouldn't work.
2,Pink harness,"I was so excited to receive based on all the reviews and payed attention to the size information provided by others. However, I must admit that I was disappointed because it looked cheap and handmade. I want the best for my girl and I dont think this is it! For me, its worth half the asking price."
3,disappointed,"Size description was not accurate; product was cute, but did not fit. Had to send back, but had to call first for return address as it shipped from FL but company was in WI. No indication on packing slip of this."
5,The authority in rating prospects,This book is fantastic. It is concise and accurate in rating the top 30 prospects in each Major League organization.
5,A Must Read!,"How should we define a book so valuable? At the risk of sounding lame, ill just say: All the poetry that Jaime Sabines had given to the world until 1977, put together in a sort of an all-in-one book.Its magical the way it takes you in a sentimental journey that also reflects the different stages in which the author created such masterpieces of literature: tears, joy, pity, passion, anger... a book that makes you feel, yes... but overall, it provokes you to go into deeper thoughts and reflections than any other poet i have read.I strongly recommend it for those who, like me 'are just starting to explore the magic world of poetry', and of course, for those who enjoy the richness and taste of the poetry of a man that created school in Mexican Contemporary Poetry."
2,Price is only for one,"I purchased this Rubbermaid drum dolly because the title said ""Lot of 2"" and at the price that would have been a great deal. Upon opening the box I found only one dolly even though on the outside of the box it stated ""Lot of 2"". I contacted the seller (Toolup) and they told me that they were sold singly. They then emailed me a return label and said they would refund my money.The dolly itself is a really nice item and I would rate it 5 stars but because of the misleading product title I can only rate this item 2 stars."
3,A Different Aldrich,"This interesting CD contains some Aldrich arrangements of famous classical melodies (Chopin, Beethoven, etc). Not everybody's taste, but nevertheless interesting, and rather pleasant."
4,The agony of lost souls,"The dawn of the 20th century, the war to end all wars was just a few months old. Enter the Lusitania a luxury british liner. It left New York in May 1915, destination Liverpool, England. She never made it because the Germans sank her just off the coast of Ireland at 1:30 PM May 7th 1915. The film shows where she lies on the bottom and how her sinking caused America to enter WWI two years later. A good film to have in your collection. This is true history and a must have for that reason alone. Like the Titanic, most people will be knowledgeable about Lusitania if you were alive at that time in history."
4,factual and revealing,"After all those years it is revealing to learn of the demise of the Lusitania and what lead up to the demise of The Lusitania, I felt sorry for all those lives lost and what the survivors had to endure."
4,National Geographic: Last Voyage of the Lusitania,"As usual, National Geographic has done a wonderful job of bringing a topic to life. If documantaries are for you, this is a MUST HAVE. Something new can be learned each and every time this is viewed."
2,Disappointing!,"This is a very ordinary practice with nothing unique for those nearing menopause. I would have liked to see a practice of restorative poses to help deal with the stresses and physical changes of that time of life. There are a few stretches, which are not held long enough; otherwise it's mostly Sun Salutations."
2,Rat-a-way granules,Works minimally. You put it out and don't see any rodents but it doesn't last very long. Rats seem to be very determined pests. Smells very heavily of moth balls.
4,A cry of pain,"In this gripping account of the lifetime of a friendship, what I sensed the most from Paul Theroux was his pain at the sudden loss of his friend. It made him seem more human to me, even though I have read most of his travel books and several of his novels. Personally, it was hard for me to imagine why V.S. Naipaul was worth keeping as a friend. For example, his treatment of his wife, Pat, as described by Theroux, left me angry and disgusted. Yet, Theroux makes it clear that it was Naipaul who first encouraged him as a young writer. How splendid it must have been to be validated by such a distinguished and accomplished author. And, thus, how devasting to be cut off suddenly and without any recognizable reason after 30 years of friendship, tolerance, and yes, love. To me, this book comes out of Theroux's pain and confusion, and the resulting look at his very real humanity will stay with me for a long time to come."
4,Boys Boys boys...,"Certainly a very good book, and well worth a read. I must say it is one of the best Theroux books I have read in quite a while, something seems to have driven him with this book, and the result is a very intriguing story. Naipaul does not come off whiter than white in this book, but then neither does Theroux. Naipul comes off worse than Theroux in this book, but with only one side of the story told, I can only conclude that they are as bad as each other. Definatly worth reading."
3,Theroux cantankerous as ever.,"For readers who are Theroux fans, Sir Vidia's Shadow will be a welcome addition from his poison pen. He is as cantankerous as he was in Oceania. Theroux is often a mean spirited, merciless inspector of peoples lives but he appears to approach the dissections honestly. And so it is with this book about his relationship with V.S. Naipaul. The first part, set in Africa, will remind readers of some of his lyrical travel writing. As his relationship with Naipaul deepens one wonders why he (P.T.) made the effort. Apparently, Naipaul is another in a long line of racist, miserly men of letters who believe their genius is an all emcompassing excuse for bad manners. As for Theroux, he displays, once again, that he'd be a dangerous man to get to know or even meet casually, unless one actually wanted to be savaged in print. A good read, but probably not the book to introduce an new reader to the wonderful world of Paul Theroux."
4,Enjoyed reading this book.,"I enjoyed reading this book. Theroux's sensuous description of his brief relationship with Nigerian girlfriend Yomo was spot-on, how a relationship between a man and woman can be, ideally. Theroux's sense of longing and loss for her is palpable. I met a woman like Yomo 15 years ago in Swaziland, her influence on me was so great that I've never left Africa. This book is also a witness to the Pat Naipul's of the world, his championing this woman makes the book worthwhile in itself. His descriptions of what it's like to be an American in Africa still hold true today. I also sense another wounded loss of love in this book, and am not so sure that this novel is the hatchet job on V.S. Naipul's character that others say it is."
2,This alleged memoir is novelist's invention.,"V.S.Naipaul, the subject of ""Sir Vidia's Shadow,"" told Paul Theroux to ""Tell The Truth""; the author's father told him to ""Be Kind."" At book's end, Theroux clains that when he was being kind he was not telling the truth. What then in the narrative is true? The book wavers among respect for Naipaul, gratitude to Naipaul, resentment of Naipaul, disgust at Naipaul, hatred of Naipaul. The book is not the memoir it purports to be. It's a novel. The alleged total recall of decades-old conversations--with everyone , not only with Naipaul--words, syntax, intonations, all delivered within quotation marks--is a novelist's invention. The last chapter, which denies every respectful statement previously made about Naipaul or his books, is so bitter in spirit it reveals ""Sir Vidia's Shadow"" to be a work of vengeance. As a novel prefaced with ""Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely..."" I would have enjoyed it, knowing much of it to be a novelist's license."
3,An Interesting yet Self-Righteous Book,"Theroux comes across as a bold, sesitive, thoughtful, egomanical and self-righteous guy.....but the insight into the creative/personal relationship between the two writers makes it worth the read."
2,Too bitter,"After reading this book, I couldn't help but wish Theroux had let some years (or even decades) pass before he wrote about Naipaul. Perhaps, with the passage of time, the bitterness that so evidently taints the latter parts of the book would have been damped, and Theroux would have been able to treat his subject with more clear-sightedness and fairness. Perhaps he would have been able to write the book he claims to have written -- an examination of friendship and of the relationship between two writers. But as it is, Theroux's sight seems clouded by an inchoate passion, and much of his book reads like the self-justifying ramblings of a jilted lover: no careful examination, no insight, no growing awareness -- only a laundry list of Naipaul's idiosyncrasies and character flaws. I think only people who are really interested in Naipaul and/or Theroux will want to read this book."
1,A shadow best left on the shelf,Memoirs are ultimately about balance and Theroux fails to find this in the book. Recounts some interesting incidents from the years of their friendship together but it is hard to tell how much of it is fictional. Theroux comes across as a very petty minded individual who projects his own traits on his subject.
2,Compare this with Naipaul's own tale of apprenticeship,"In Naipaul's 'A Way In The World', there is an account of his own relationship with an elder writer, Foster Morris. In spare, unsentimental and clinical prose, Naipaul dissects this relationship, dealing with the help and the let-downs that he received. Anyone who's read Theroux's self-serving rant would be well-advised to read 'A Way In The World' to see how Naipaul himself writes about his relationship with a writer during his younger days."
5,A must have resource for any crocheter's reference shelf,"This book is exactly what I needed. I have many patterns that call for the boring old granny square. I wanted squares with variety: delicate squares, detailed squares, or squares with no open spaces for a skirt, and so on. Not only is this book full of inspiring squares but it also has information on joining, basic stitches, choosing colors and more. I'm sure I'll be using this book for years to come."
4,A true delight for crocheters,Enjoyable book containing not quite 200 crochet blocks. Some are duplicates and are numbered simply because they are done with different color combinations. A great deal of detail goes in to the forward of the book that suggests block combinations for afghans. I truly enjoy the patterns in this book and have used many of the squares for swapping in my Ravelry groups.The only reason I gave it four stars is because I was a little cheesed that there are not 200 original patterns. Other than that this is an excellent book to add to your collection.
2,not as good as it looks,"This book is beautiful to look at, but the instructions are very poor and confusing. My first square worked out just fine, but it was a simple one. (# 52?) The more difficult squares which are harder to intuit have confusing directions and I tried three blocks three times each and could not make them come out like the picutures and was confused by the directions when actually putting hook to yarn. Dangit! Also, the two blocks I tried successfully are not the same size.The pros are that the pictures are good and she shows several blocks in different colors. She also shows several projects and different ways to put together various shapes of blocks. Her use of color is lovely IMO.Just such a disappointment not to be able to create some of my favorite blocks because the directions are so poor. I will stick to books with charts from now on. This is such a let-down!"
4,Good Book,Book has many creative ideas on how to create a variety of blocks and gives some ideas for blankets. The book does assume that you are using only the kind of yarn that they suggest to get the same sized blocks.
5,Create book on Blocks,I have used this book many times to create custom projects. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I would recommend the book for any skill level.
4,excellent selection of blocks,"I love the color choice section at the beggining, incredible graphics and book desing. well explaind patterns. must say many ""new patterns"" are just color changes. anyway love it!"
4,Make Sure you are getting the AMERICAN title...,"It was with much excitement that I ordered this book from Amazon. Took forever to arrive and when it did I understood why. Seems that it had to ""jump the pond"" to get here--i.e. what I had (inadvertently) ordered was the British edition of this book. Blocks and stitches are the same--but the names of the stitches are different, which can be confusing to a beginner.I will be reordering this book sometime in the future as the blocks are beautiful, and the variety is great. Be sure, however, that if you want the American edition you purchase the book published by Interweave Press with the blue and green blocks on the cover. --Susan Engelhardt"
5,Bits and Pieces,"My knitting group crochets, knits, and quilts for those in our community who need blankets, booties, hats, afghans, quilts, lap blankets and similar items. We often work with donated yarn or the leftovers in our own stash. This book is terrific. It is full of ideas and patterns for our projects. I use bits of yarn that would normally be discarded to make granny square lap robes for nursing homes. The book was written to make these squares easy to do; the patterns are enticing and the directions clear. For each square, the level of skill needed is noted, and suggestions for color are inspiring. You will love these patterns. Granny squares can be boring -- but not these squares!"
3,Did anyone proofread this book before press?,It's true that the blocks are creative and beautiful but the instructions for every block I've made so far have been wrong. I would only recommend this book to confident and experienced crocheters who can figure out how to make the block turn out correctly on their own.
5,One of My Favorite,"I use this book quite often and like it very much. It has many easy and beautiful squares for the beginner, intermedite and expert crocheter. I highly recommend it to all other crocheters."
5,A little talent and a few scraps,"I love this book because it shows you how you can take little pieces and put them together to make the most beautiful things with just a little bit of creativity! There are so many possibilities by combining the different squares; the ideas and color choices are endless. And it's just as possible to make beautiful squares with all your tidbits of yarn leftover from all those large projects, combine them together and you have a lovely scrap afghan. This is a wonderful resource to have!"
2,More like 30 or 50 crochet blocks,"This book has a couple cute squares in it, but a lot of them are just plain crochet with stripes added. The author changes the colors of the stripes and then calls it a whole different block, really inflating the actual number of blocks you get for your money in this book. There are some decent-looking squares, so it's worth checking out from the library but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Also, the color choices strike me as kind of garish, making it difficult to get too inspired."
5,"200 Crochet Blocks for Blankets, Throws and Afghans: ....","Love the book and plan to do each of the 200 blocks as possible to make 1 blanket. It would be cool to make a blanket with different blocks. The book was purchased ""used"" and received it in acceptable condition. Would purchased from seller in future since I did not experienced any issues."
2,disappointing,"Before you buy, I recommend you visit a brick and mortar store and peruse. I didn't, was disappointed and had to pay for return shipping.I can only recommend this for absolute beginners or for people with no color sense as she does do beautiful color combinations.However, all of the patterns are text only (too many mistakes and the symbols make errors and how to correct completely easy) and in my experience Interweave Press is VERY bad at proofreading before going to press (yes, they do post corrections on their website, but why can't they just get it right the first time??)."
2,Misleading book,"While some of the patterns are quite nice, as other reviews say, there are not actually 200 different crochet blocks. The number is closer to 100 when discounting repeats of the same pattern with different colors. A dishonest title also disappoints in other ways. Also, while the blocks are supposedly all the same size, they are not, so you have to add or pull out rows in order to join blocks together. Since stitch counts are not given at the end of row directions, this makes it even harder to decide which blocks will easily fit together. Additionally, some blocks will not lie flat when created as written. Thus, while some of the patterns are quite pretty, I would not recommend purchasing this book."
2,"Elaine, Sunnyvale, CA","I have been crocheting for 30+ years but wanted to learn some new stitches so bought this book. While the colors and the squares are just beautiful, I found the instructions on several of the blocks very confusing. In more than one case, I had to look at the picture to figure out what to do next. Lucky my crochet experience allowed me to do that. I wouldn't recommend this book for a beginner and maybe even intermediate as it just isn't written clearly."
3,NOT 200 SQUARES,"As many reviewers have already stated, there are NOT 200 different block designs. The author does indeed recycle patterns, displaying them in different colours and qualifying them as additional patterns. This is disappointing. The title is MISLEADING, even if the contents are wonderful."
5,Lot's of color,"I love color and this book will certainly help you add it to your blanket or whatever you want. The squares can easily be modified to make a skirt or even a sweater, think of all the compliments you would get."
5,Better buy some more wool!,"Yummy pictures, color and combination suggestions, understandable directions and lots of other information make this book both a great resource and definite crochet eye candy."
1,Deception,"When I ordered this book there was another book with a title that was almost identical, but it had a different cover so I ordered it. Knowing there are an infinite number of crocheted squares, I thought I would be getting the ultimate in diversity.As it turns out, I had ordered two books that were identical beyond the cover. To add insult to injury, I had to wait 4 months for the second book.I know publishers will often change covers and I have always thought of it as being deceptive and this was no different. Somehow Amazon found out about this and the second book is not being offered any longer, but now I have to go through the extra time to return one of the books.I am very disappointed in this practice."
4,Lovely blocks!,"I just love the patterns in this book and like that the book teaches ways to utilize the blocks. The blocks are fresh, colorful & modern. I'd give it 5 stars, but I have found errors in the patterns. Nothing too bad, though & for anyone with crochet experience, you'll be able to figure out the right way to do it. Overall, I really enjoy working the blocks from this book."
4,crochet book,My daughter loves to crochet and has found this book to be very helpful. She has made several afghans and also has used the patterns to make some baby crochet throws for friends. She felt the directions were easy to understand. Would recommend for any person who loves to crochet.
2,many errors,Beautiful book.But every block I have tried has a mistake and I have not been able to complete one.Very disappointing.I would not purchase it.
3,So-so,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book-it's nicely done and has clear instructions, but the actual number of totally different squares seems to be many less than the advertised 200. Many of the squares are just variations of other ones; I'd hoped for 200 really different types of squares and don't feel that I got what I'd expected. The book will be used, but probably not as much as I'd expected."
2,Not For The Experienced Crocheter!,I purchased this week at my local craft store. This is a great book for the beginner. The patterns are very simple to work - I found them to be boring - most are in single crochet. There were only 2-3 difficult patterns - not enough to keep my attention. THat's why the 2 star rating..... THe book is bright and colorful and would make a nice gift for someone learning to crochet
2,Nice picture/hidden costs,"I've owned this TV almost 2+1/2 years now. The picture is nice, it has nice sound, the on screen menu is intuitive and easy to use. I would give it a much higher rating if it were more reliable. The picture went black after having it less than a year and getting warranty repair was not simple or easy to arrange, however it was provided at no cost to me and included pickup and return. The TV worked fine for another year plus, but a couple weeks ago I started having power supply problems again - turn it on and the opening screen flashes on and off for a while before it comes on, a few seconds at first, now a few minutes.If your shopping for a new flat panel TV, be sure to include the cost of an extended warranty for this one when comparing prices."
5,Excellent,"I've had this television for a little over 2.5 years.It's HDMI compatible with 1080i.Screen is great with every medium (DVDs, BlueRays, PS3, XBOX360, and computer).Excellent Purchase!"
2,campbell hausfeld fp2028 air compressor,bought this compressor to inflate car tires. the air tip broke on my lst use. dont know how good of a compressor it is because i only used it once. too bad the air applicator broke.
4,Perfect household unit for inflation/maintenance tasks.,"I've been using this for a month now. Exactly what I expected. Perfect compact & lightweight unit to keep the vehicles and bikes aired-up. Small tank looses pressure quickly, but a huge improvement over the tankless models."
3,"Works OK, for a few things","I purchased this compressor for the sole purpose of inflating tires. With multiple cars, motorcycles, and bicycles, it made sense to have a basic compressor. This one does that just fine. However, it is very loud, and because of the small capacity, will be running constantly. Personally, I wish I would have spent the extra $50 for something a bit larger. But this works alright for the intended purpose."
1,Will not purchase again,"My wife bought this for me for Christmas a year and a half ago. I used it to inflate car tires a few times a year. A few months ago the pressure would not build past 42lbs. After some troubleshooting I replaced the safety valve for about 24.00 (Sears Parts Store). Still would not build. I ended up taking apart the piston assembly, it looked fine no burnt or scratched valve no bad piston ring. Re-assembled and it was fixed! 100lbs psi again. Two days later down to 25lbs. This thing is loud and after taking this apart I can see why its cheap. The only replacement for the piston I can find is the whole motor/piston assembly which is probably more than a new compressor. Look elsewhere for a better quality unit."
4,meets my expectations,"I purchased this product because I was tired of having to drive somewhere to pay 75 cents for air for my 3 vehicles. For my needs it is perfect, it's loud, but I expected that so I just wear ear protection. For the price I paid of $42.74 you can't beat it."
3,Campbell Hausfeld Pancake Air Compressor,"Very load compressor. I read reviews before saying that it was load, but I wasn't expecting it to be this load. Very unbearable in doors. Performance: I was able to fill one tire from 30 to 35 then another from 30 to 33 psi with 40 psi left in the tank. Overall great price, but a little too loud. I'd say save up and just buy a bigger size since most of C.H. compressors are a lot softer than this."
1,junk,JUNK junk junk junk junk junk JUNK junk junk junk junk junk JUNK junk junk junk junk jun JUNK junk junk junk junk junk did I say Junk
2,Air Compressor,"Though a good price, this unit is not powerful enough to use tools such as an impact wrench. You should consider it ok for inflating tires but it takes quite a while to build up enough air pressure to even do that."
2,Weak...very weak,"I was really excited about this purchase since it meant I wouldn't have to drag out my big compressor every time I needed to add air to a tire. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by this ""tool"". All I wanted was a simple & portable compressor to inflate tires and the kids balls, etc. First time I tried to inflate a car tire, it failed to deliver, meaining now I have a $40 soccer ball & bicycle pump."
2,What I expected...sort of,"Portable air compressors make noise and this one makes alot of noise. But it's what I expected from an oil free unit that is portable. It seems well constructed and I put it through it's break in period as per instructed, we'll see if it can last. The accessories are lame: tire air chuck, ball needle and 2 tiny filler nozzles, have to get an air gun and the tire chuck looks weak. The hose provided is horrible it doesn't extend at all, I can pick up the unit with it and it barely uncoils.Once I get the accessory issues tamed i'll use it to blow off hard to reach equipment. Really don't have room for a larger compressor will make due with this one."
2,very light duty,"This unit is essentially a toy. Ii is very noisy and it takes a long time to fill the air tank. Once the tank is full it is consumed quickly. It took me nearly 20 minutes to fill a tire. I had to jack up vehicle for the tire to inflate!Usefull only to fill toys.Amazon service is Outstanding! They ship promptly, you get what you order, and it's super easy to track your items. Very satisfied!"
1,"LOUD, and I mean LOUD, and POOR quality","we've had this unit for a little over 6 months - every use is very LOUD, and now it's seized up, and not working at all, so it's back to Amazon for a better quality replacement. I checked warranty issues, and it's only for a month!! what a shame. No more CH items for me."
3,Good for small jobs,"This is a good small compressor. I bought it for infrequent use and believe it will be just fine for the occasional flat tire, brad nail project, etc. It has worked well so far, but big forewarned, this little compressor is very loud. The Amazon seller provided excellent, fast service and product arrived in good working order."
2,Underpowered & Noisy,"I bought this unit in hopes of using it as an inflator and to blow dust and grass off my lawn tractor. The instructions are pretty useless. You need to use pipe tape to seal every fitting. Even when properly set up, the unit never reaches anything close to 100psi. The best I was able to get was 50. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is it's a better inflator then what I had. There has to be a good light duty air compressor out there but this isn't it."
2,Loud and cheap quality,"Pros: It works for the most part.Cons: Like the other reviewers said, it's REALLY loud. The other main drawback is that the included nozzle heads are exceptionally low quality and just about useless. Please do not be tricked into thinking this is a good deal because of the ""Accessory kit."" Using the included accessories is an exercise in frustration.In summary, if you are willing to shell out more money for good quality accessories, this thing is mostly usable."
2,LOUD!!!,"I bought this compressor after reading other reviews on it that said that it was quiet & another site said that this was supposed to be quiet. I was excited when I got it home and hooked it up, but then I turned it on and it was so loud that I had to leave the room, after 30 seconds I started getting a bad headache!!! I bought this for my computer repair company to blow out used computers so that I would not have to buy air in a can, but I can't use it for that without driving out my customers. This thing was so loud that it sounded like there was a broken piston rod, I was sure that was what the problem was, but it filled with air so that can't be it. I went to Menards and found them selling the same set and asked them to plug in their floor model and it was really loud also, though not as loud as mine. I wish that I had never bought this wimpy, piece of junk!!!"
2,Noisy air,"Pro's: CheapCon's: Very noisy, need earplugs. Hard to inflate tires, as attachment won't depress when pressed unto tire valve, especially if tire very flat. Have to use before tank builds pressure, and hold valve stem so it doesn't sink into tire rim."
3,Always tedious to use.,"I don't see how other reviewers can say this refills quickly--I think that takes a very long time. So, all tasks are tedious and slow. If you can't carry around a bigger, better unit, this may be the best that you may able to manage! I think, at home this is better than a DC unit for inflation. For less hassle and wasted time, get a better/bigger capacity unit, if you can afford and manage it--you'll be much better off in the future!"
2,Okay ....BUT....,"You could find better original recordings of these songs by both groups on Amazon.Better yet --- just get Elvis' gospel recordings with ELVIS singing the lead.These guys sounded better with Elvis and they were younger then as well.Personally, I would pass on this CD."
5,UPDATE,"This is Chelsea Churro, fixing some stuff that I said earlier. This limo has a hot tub, drink bar (not illegal drinks), diso ball, seats, and a tv. This limo includes pictures of the My Scene girls and friends (maybe from the movie!). Please get this limo. It is super cool. Please don't accuse it of copying off of the Bratz limo, because there are no similarities besides the price but those differ by $10."
1,Not a great toy,"For the price that I paid, the toy is not worth it. It's very lite and just feels cheap. My daughter got the toy for xmas 05 and if she broke it my January 06, I would not be angry with her at all being that whatever the toy is made out of seems very cheap. I'm afraid to pick it up and move it."
4,it's nice,i really like this limo it's nothing like the bratz bus. the bratz bus is a ugly gray color and it was $100!!!!!!! the my scene limo did not copie off the bratz bus.see my chart1 the my scene limo is purple2 they had the idea to make the limo way before the bratz bus3the hot tub actally works4 it is alot bigger than the bratz bus5 my scene did not copie off bratz6 bratz copie off diva stars that was made by mattel
5,Much Better Than Picture!,"I wasn't sure about this because of the sketchy picture but it turned out to be much better than I expected. I bought it as a gift for my brother in law and I was not embarrassed to give it to him because it came professionally packaged in plastic with a cardboard capper with the MLB logo and labeled as ""Embroidered Golf Towel"" so your buddy doesn't think you got him a hand towel. Great quality on the Phillies logo/embroidering. Also contains a swivel clip to attach to the golf bag. No complaints here!"
2,Instructor's Edition?,I received the teacher's book and was confused. There wasn't anything to let me know that it wasn't a regular copy. It's not very different from the regular book but that's beside the point.
2,cheap and made cheap,"The metal on this stripped away quickly, making it hardly usable. I put a piece of folded up paper in it to make it hold down the strings. I ended up buying another capo. I gave it two stars because it was technically usable after my paper alteration -- although highly annoying."
2,Really cheap for a reason,"Gets the job done, but barely. I bought this capo because I could afford it, but it really hardly clamps down enough to help. And I've tried it on several different guitars. Buy it if you're in a bind and need something cheap; but definitely don't if you want a reliable product that actually works well."
5,A book you can read over and over again.,This book was recommended by my highschool psychology teacher. I have read it many times since then which was ten years ago. The story is fascinating and thrilling. It follows the lives of three men from highschool to adulthood and how they are living with their terrible secret which comes back to haunt them. A must read!
2,Regret dealing with this seller,"This item was under the heading ""Brand New"", which is why I bought it. WHen I received it, the book's spine was broken majorly, the pages were folded. In other words, the condition of this item was totally misrepresented and I'm disgusted. I'm not sending it back to the seller; my post office is hard to get to and has odd hours. Just writing it off to a bad transaction."
1,Back when they sounded like everyone else...,"Well, I became a fan of The Number Twelve Looks Like You about 2 years ago with the release of ""An Inch of Gold.."" and especially with their MUCH BETTER full length, ""Nuclear Sad Nuclear."" What makes ""Nuclear"" such a great record is that it stands out as being so different from the hundreds of other releases every year coming from bands who perform this style of music.What makes this album so terrible is it sounds just like everyone else. Not much originality and definitely missing a lot of the quirks and nuances that make this band so entertaining today. This is before The Number Tweleve really came into their own and became innovative. If you gladly listen to whatever is put out in this form of music, and don't actually have a concern for lyrical improvement, and intellgent/original musical arrangements, then this album will make you happy, otherwise just get ""Nuclear"" and enjoy this excellent band!"
2,What a waste!,"Ok, I love anthologies. I have been reading them for the past 14 years. I like getting to know new authors alongside old ones. This anthology was a waste of my time. The stories were trite and cliche. One or two stories rises above the mediocre and is a pleasent enough read. I liked Von jocks "" The Fairest"". The story centers around a woman who becomes obsessed with her looks and lose herself in the process, but finds her again self after looking in to a magic mirror. The story was funny, intresting and well written. Sad to say this one was the only story to stand out in my mind. As an editor Denise Little can an usally do better, I guess thats what makes this collection so disapointing."
4,Good CD,"Nice retro Trance CD.If you liked trance from 5-10 years ago, this CD is great.A good way to go to remember the older trance days."
1,Incorrect Product Description,"Purchased this hitch based on the Product Description on the Amazon web page which stated it would fit on a 2002 Honda Civic, would install in 20 minutes and, most important to me, it required NO drilling into the car's body. First, the photo on the web page showed a receiver hitch which was completely different from the hitches I received. (I returned the original hitch and reordered after talking with Amazon's rep on the phone.) Second, both hitches, Models 11206 and 112062, are the same hitch and both require drilling 4 holes in the floor pan of the trunk. I'm still searching for a Class 1 receiver hitch which requires no drilling."
2,40 mb click disk,during the search the sale was listed as a 10 pack of disksonly one camei donot think i will buy from this site again
3,Beware - Not the Bounce Movie Soundtrack,"A word of warning! I just bought this CD, thinking that it was the Bounce Movie Soundtrack featuring the LEIGH NASH song ""Need to Be Next To You"" that I've been hearing on my local radio station, but it WASN'T.It was pretty easy for me to get confused since the album artwork of the the soundtrack and the score are nearly identical. I did return the CD and got the correct Bounce CD that features some of my favorite female singers including Beth Orton, Dido and Delerium featuring Sarah McLachlin. I loved the movie and I'm loving the soundtrack. Check it out."
4,great cd from fairly unknow band,"this cd is fantastic, I hadnt heard the morning after girls before I saw them open for BRMC. they put on a pretty amazing show, very much a wall of sound. the cd does the live experience pretty good justice, the songs are well written and have an exciting sound"
2,Hate the Layout,"First of all I and my children enjoy all the Mr. Putter and Tabby stories, they are great. Unfortunately who ever converted this series to Kindle format didn't do this series any justice. There will be a page that looks copied directly from a paper book, the image small and faint and tiny text. then there will be full sized picture, and then the next page will be regular kindle text. So you will read one page and then skip over then next couple or you will be reading the same text twice and straining your eyes. Too frustrating for me as an adult and I know I young reader wouldn't even bother. I strongly suggest checking out these ebooks from your local library before purchasing."
3,Kindle Edition left much to be desired.,My daughter loves all Mr. Putter and Tabby books. The story deserves a 5 star rating - but I rated this a 3 star due to the drawbacks of the Kindle Edition of the book. The way the book shows on the Kindle is frustrating. The words are too small and grey colored to read. The Kindle Edition does show the words big enough to read but only on a separate page without illustrations - which makes for flipping more pages and the experience of reading the book is just - blah - because of that. Wished I had spent my money on a paper edition of the book instead of Kindle edition. The Kindle Edition was a waste of money.
4,The oldest novels?,"Hagg traces the birth of the modern novel to written tales amongst the Greek speaking populations of the eastern Mediterranean in the last centuries BC. He suggests that from that era, the Greeks developed our modern conception of what a novel is.He summarises key contemporary Greek tracts and compares them against each other and indeed often subjects them to a modern analysis. The style of his discourse is not dry; his wit often shows through. He claims that most Greek literature can be understood from the point of view of the novel.To readers who, like me, never majored in ancient Greek history, let alone be able to read Greek, Hagg can make 2000 year old narratives come to life."
2,not my cup of tea,"I am sure this is a good quality product and it has surely endured for many years. I enjoy many floral candies and teas and thought this would be a no-brainer. Nope, it tastes too bitter and soapy for me."
5,I love it,"A million thanks for carring this product, my long time childhood favorite. Easy to order arrives as promised and in perfect packging, fresh and at a truly decent price."
2,"Plentiful, Inexpensive, and Disappointing","I was quite hopeful about this candy, as I love the flavour of violet and having an inexpensive bulk supply would be quite nice.Unfortunately, rather than using a natural violet flavour, this candy uses an artificial one. This makes it take on a rather flat and overpowering floral note, without any of the more interesting characteristics of violet (real violet flavouring always had a spicy undertone that reminded me of celery seed.)Additionally, the artificial colouring gives it a bitter note on the back of the tongue. The flavour of the violet candy put out by L'Anis de Flavigny is much superior (and also available from Amazon.)"
4,oh I didn't know these were still around,"My grandmother often got care packages from Ireland (these couldn't be found in the midwest in the 70's can't be found now either!) and there wouldn't be packages of these tucked into corners. I didn't know they were originally an American product until I found them here, I thought they were European. They are really unusually because they are such a very floral tasting candy, at first as a child I didn't care for them, I think because I initially ate one expecting it to be mint tasting, but when I tried them a second time I found I really enjoyed them. You find you can't eat several of them at once, but one or two here or there and they are really enjoyable."
3,Not packed properly. Arrived crumbled. Still taste good though.,"I really like these candies. was excited to find them at Amazon rather than scouring drugstores for them. Unfortunately they are not packed well, or protected in anyway so they arrived crumbled. All of them. Still taste good though."
4,Heavy and simple,"These ankle weights certainly do the job, but for extended wear are a bit uncomfortable at least in part because the closure is a single-directional velcro strap instead of having a ring and pulling back against the ring to tighten the weights. Because of this, they always seem a bit loose. Aside from that, however, the build quality seems very good and the adjustable weight is very useful."
5,Litt Riffs,I had to have this book for a literature class. This came in time for my class and is an excellent book. I still have it and the class has been over. Has some really cool/interesting stories in it. Highly recommend it.
3,reversi,"Lit Riffs is a unique concept, one so obvious you'd smack yourself on the forehead for not having considered it: stories based on songs, when the reverse is quite common. The choices of songs to base a tale on is wildly disparate, which is cool. Thankfully this collection didn't go down the route of all easily recognizable pop songs.More interesting than the book is the companion recording of cover versions of the songs that inspired Lit Riffs, soon to be released by S.A.M. records; My favorite track is the rendering of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah by the band Teenage Girls. Covers of Cohen songs tend toward the slavishly faithful; it's refreshing to hear a group make it seem new."
1,Not for Windows XP,"I had this game on my wish list, thinking it would be fun, but the description states that it's for Windows XP and it isn't. It's only for Windows 95 or lower, so it won't run on my computer. Very misleading!"
2,Crap and not worth the cash,Has the statutes but not all...gives you the useless history on some aspects only. I don't understand why Hogg is so popular as a writer.
1,Warning: Not a soundtrack,"This is not a soundtrack for the film ""Steel,"" as you might expect from the ""SOUNDTRACK"" designation in its title. It's actually an audio drama recreation of the movie, intended for children.On that level, it certainly gets the job done. However, most kids will probably not be thrilled with the storyline of ""Steel"" anyway, which is not nearly as outrageous as, say, that same summer's other DC Comics film, ""Batman & Robin."" ""Steel"" is decidedly grounded in comparison, and even less original than the inept ""Batman & Robin"" was.Ultimately, why would you want an audio version of the movie when you could just watch the movie? And why would you want to do that anyway?"
5,The Best Record They Never Made!,"I have always been a big fan of Incognito. I love the horn, funk, soul sound and this band was always a cool mixture of old and newer more cutting edge sounds. My only problem always was that each individual album wasn't strong from start to finish. The band's musicianship always outpaced the songwriting I guess.Here is a best case example of why labels should put out the ""greatest"" hits packages. This is the best album Incognito never made :) get it - you won't be disappointed here"
5,DEFINITELY!!,"Have always been a HUGE Incognito fan. This collection is simply fabulous, even though i think they should've added more tracks from their releases between 1992-1996. But then again, i still think this compilation is worth every penny."
1,Mediocre Wedding Band,"I bought this based on the enthusiasm of the reviews. I can only surmise that the reviewers are either friends and family of this group, or that Incognito has compromising pictures of the reviewers. If you're into wedding bands, then this is for you. If you're looking for an original sound with a real groove, look elseswhere."
2,What the bleat?,"As soon as i opened it, i tried both sounds. The grunt works very well but there is no bleat. I read the directions over and over (not really too complicated) and i can hear the thing inside moving but no bleat."
5,compact and great coveragee,"a small unit that does both, grunt call and doe bleet. sounds very real.. would highly recommend. a must for any hunting trip."
4,"Its good, but I bought it too soon.","I have to agree with another reviewer here. The book had more information than I new what to do with at this time, since I am just considering a career change into the computer field. I know I want to be a computer consultant, but I got a bit intimidated by all the info this book has. Which is good, in general, but I guess I should have purchased it a bit down the line when I am close to completing my training.I took the advice of another reviewer here and bought ""The Secret Path to Contract Programming Riches,"" because it is the only programming/consulting book I've found that was written for those in the absolute beginner, from a technical perspective.I will keep this book and refer to it as I near completion of my training, so I can move into consulting as quickly as I can.I would have given it 5 stars, but as I said, I am too new to this field and could not digest it all yet."
5,Good devotional,I have been enjoying the devotionals that are in this book. They are thought provoking and make one examine their life.
1,kitchen holder,"The wooden anchor holding the plastic sheets has such a horrible chemical smell we had to send it back. Clearly, the finish applieddoes not comply with safety, odor issues for kitchen use. Would not recommend this product."
5,LOVE IT,Works like a charm! Holds all recipe books very well and I love that I can adjust the back piece of plastic to either have the book upright or at a slant. Also works well with single sheets of paper.
5,Not Just For Cookbooks,"I take this to meals whenever I'm eating by myself. It folds flat so it's easy to put into a knapsack or atache case, and it eliminates the problem of trying to hold a book in one hand while wielding a fork or other gastronomical weaponry with the other. Almost every time I use it someone will ask where I got it. The plastic does scratch over time, but it's easy enough to replace."
5,Great Idea,"I got this for my significant other for Christmas, who by the way is a great cook. She has used it already, and likes it. She would recommend this."
5,It works!,"This cookbook holder is recommended by Cook's Illustrated, who noted in their review that there is a surprising number of cookbook holders which don't hold most/many sizes of cookbooks. This one does. It holds big books and single sheets of paper. It's design allows you to (extremely easily) adjust it to fit your size of book. I can't imagine a cookbook that would not fit in this...if you can lift it, it will fit. And it's easy to read from. It is also attractive with the wooden base. It is rather expensive, so if you can find one that works for less, I would go for it. But if you don't want to spend the time doing so or haven't been successful yet, go for this one!"
5,Excellent and the last cookbook holder you'll need,"Thanks to all the other folks who left their reviews on this cookbook holder. I have to say, it really is excellent, everything that everyone said is true. It's very smart yet simple design and it folds up real easy. Plus of course it does what it's supposed to do: Hold cookbooks (and very well)! I would highly recommend. Got it for my wife for XMAS and she loves it (I do too), very handy when cooking as we all know, fellow chefs!"
4,Enjoyable,"My review is based on the VHS tape version that was released years earlier.Given the magnitude of Guadalcanal and the number of important battles fought on and near it, the relatively short running time of this documentary can only begin to touch the surface of the overall story. Instead, it deals heavily with the emotions of the men on both sides who fought the battles and in that regard I think it does an admirable job of conveying to the viewer a little of what they felt.I've shown this video to a number of WWII veterans and they have unanimously given it high marks. Those wanting a more precise historical account of the Guadalcanal campaign may be somewhat disappointed and might be better served by reading one of the many excellent books published on the subject including the companion book to this video."
4,Someone was Forgotten!,While this is a good solid film about one of the fights that we had to win. I was very disappointed that Admiral Halsey was not mentioned as he was one of the major reasons why we won that fight. Also The first Battleship versus Battleship fight was not mentioned when Adm Lee with the Battle Ships USS Washington and the South Dakota literally blew the Old Battle Ship Kiroshima right out of the water with some outstanding Radar Shooting. Oh well!
4,Great watch for the price,"Small E6B scale is a bit hard to read, but fine with glasses on. Durable, rugged, nice metal band."
5,Not bad for a quartz watch,"I'm a fob watch collector and for me, if it's not self winding, it is not a watch. But after I read the review by JP below and I realized that he made a very good point about the differences between quartz and automatic. It is a nice watch, but I hate the dome crystal which is annoying sometime. Seiko makes good watch, but their chrono is suckiest. This watch grabs more attention among my friend than my Oris and Rado. Not a bad watch for the money."
5,Classy... Sporty... Elegant... Manly,"This watch is absolutely beautiful. My fiance loves it. This purchase was worth it. It is very sporty, classy and elegant. Goes very well with dark executive suits. You will not regret the purchase!"
4,Great Deal for a Beautiful and Functional Watch,"PROS: This watch is a great deal for functionality and looks. It feels well made. The bezel turns smoothly, but not freely (perfect). The watch is beautiful. It does do dual time so you can show UTC/GMT simultaneously with local time. The chrono is spot on. The alarm is a nice feature too.CONS: The watch came with a large ""Made in China"" sticker plastered to the back of the case. I was expecting a Japanese watch based on the description and was somewhat disappointed. Hopefully it holds up. Also, the crystal is not sapphire as it says in the description. It is a Hardlex crystal, proprietary to Seiko and similar to a mineral crystal."
5,Best watch I've ever owned,"I was a little on the fence regarding this purchase, and before it came I sent a request to the seller to return. Well, the watch came and I was flabbergasted. It looks extremely beautiful and it has a distinct look that sets it apart from other watches in this price range. There's no way I'm going to part with this watch any time soon unless someone steals it from me. I hope that it will keep well over the next few years as I plan to wear it A LOT!!!"
5,buy it now,Over the past five years i have personally read over 300 books on the subject of personal developement and i would have to say this book rates in the top 3 books i've ever read ... buy it now
1,being the solution - a review,"i was about to order the book from amazon, but then i decided to see if theres a cheaper option, and then theres an ebook available, so i bought the ebook, and now im writing this review, i dont really like writing reviews but this one i feel i need to let u know of my opinion, i think there is nothing new here, 21 days to transformation, vizualization, come on, this to me is a garbage ,i just wish they offer a money back, i just cant understand why this book has a nine-5-star-review, i cant stop thinking that maybe those 9 are part of a team, very very dissappointed."
5,Works fantastic,"Does exactly what its supposed to! Doesn't have cables, but i had some on hand. Easy to install and looks great!"
1,Best of the Trammps review,"This hurts me to say this as I love the Trammps and their music.I bought this CD on the understanding that these were the original releases, but on hearing them they have beenre-recorded and are nowhere near as good as the original records. I bought the original 7"" vinyl records in 70's when first released and wanted to replace them on CD now that the vinyls are scratched and worn. The first 6 tracks are very inferior to the originals and the last 4 tracks are not Trammps records but made famous by other artists."
1,Trammps,Bogus. These are not the original tracks and they lack a lot of the original feeling of those great records. The covers are mere filler. Let me save you the time it cost me to execute a return to Amazon....
3,"Amusing, but not very informative","Some books are just plain fun to read, and Welsch's takes a high place on that list. As an avid picker of wild greens, it's quite amazing how many plants take their place at his table. The wide-ranging narrative offers many vignettes, from the neighbor trying to take over his river frontage to his campaign for county weed control officer (with a unique, pro-weed platform).If you're looking for hints about what to pick, don't get your hopes up. He very deliberatly doesn't list edible plants or preparations, since regional selections differ so widely. Instead of the plants themselves, this looks more at the man who loves them and at his hunter-gatherer experiences. If that's what you want, great, but I hoped for more how-to.-- wiredweird"
1,Best of the best,"This book is the ""best of the best""for explaining in easy to understand terms how to lower you blood pressure without medication. I have bought several of these books and often give them away to family and friends if they express an interest."
3,WARNING: MISSING TRACKS,"I want everyone to know that this is a 5-star album. I absolutely love the renditions on this album. My father owned it on vinyl, so I thought I would get the CD version.However, I'm astoundingly disappointed with the production of the CD version. First, I noticed that it's missing two tracks: ""A Group of Children's Songs,"" which is a slight medley of Children songs done by multiple artists, and the Weavers version of ""This Land is Your Land"" (which is an awesome rendition--it's supposed to be the very last track). Then I noticed that it doesn't even retain the same tracking order as the vinyl. To add insult to injury, this could use some remastering.Overall, buying this CD is worth it if you've never heard the original album. Just be aware that it is not a complete replica of the original album. If you're not okay with that, try finding a vinyl copy."
2,I can see why they did it again.,"I love this musical, but after hearing the revival version I lost all interest in this one. I think the revival captures the essence of more of the characters with more songs, and its faster pace keeps everything moving along better than this album. I'd stick with the revival."
2,Cute but...,"Some nice songs (the title song, ""Snoopy"" and ""Happiness"") make this a charming piece. However, it is a minor musical and somewhat uninteresting for adult listeners unless you've seen and loved the show. It might attract kids since it's inspired in the popular comic strip character. It's a ""chamber"" musical, without spectacular orchestrations and similar to THE FANTASTICKS in that respect, although the Ton Jones/Harvey Schmidt piece is far more superior. The recording is excellent, considering it's a 1967 show."
1,Not worth the money,"After watching my son play Linus in a local performance of the Broadway Revival, I surprised him with a copy of the CD. I chose the orginal cast recording because it had additional features and the reviews led me to believe it was the better one. Without his knowledge,I put the CD in on our way to vacation. He was very surprised, but very disappointed. You could barely hear any speaking parts or songs. It was recorded in a very low sound level and turning up the volume does no good. He has not listened to it once and it certainly was not worth the money."
1,Good songs.....but not the greatest recording,"I was in this show and it was so much fun! The music is awesome! So after the show closed I went out and bought the soundtrack and I was not impressed at all. I realize that all of these adults are acting as kids, but I dont think that they even tried to make it sound good. And just like it says in the CD cover, Lucy's voice sounds like fingernails against a chalk-board: she fits right in. Overall I give this one star because the writing itself is good...but I would be downright embarassed if I was a part of this particular cast! I have never heard the original broadway cast recording, but just by listening to this, I can tell you one thing: buy the other recording!! Anything is better than this!!"
2,Bad copy,"Clarity of picture is perfect. One big annoyance, there is a baby crying throughout the whole play. How can you have the ordasity to sell sommthing like this. You can not enjoy the show. I will not be purchasing anymore product from here!!"
4,Looking and finally found it,"After searching in several stores (in hopes that they could order it), I was disappointed to hear that this CD had been discounted.Well, after following a friend's suggestion, I went on Amazon.com and found something that I really wanted. My year long search had finally ended. The CD is the first installment by this group. For their first, I really think that it was a captivating CD. Left me wanting to hear their next CD. Very smooth listening and I really love the title track!"
4,Finding truth,"Neil, a young lad in Ireland, struggles to live truthfully as a gay youth while pretending with his parents and friends that he's just one of the guys. He slowly becomes involved in Dublin's gay community, and meets another guy who's a few years older, but before anything can happen, Neil is attacked by gay-bashers. After recovering, Neil finds that dating is difficult, especially when he's hiding so much, and the relationship sours. Neil comes out to his parents and friends, and finds some support, but everything changes, some for the worse and some for the better. This amazing coming out story does end with hope and a possibility for a connection to combat the loneliness of living as a gay man in a small town. Like Stuart Thorogood's ""Outcast"" and K. M. Soehnlein's ""The World of Normal Boys"", Lennon's book is a potent, poignant tale of what it's like being young and gay."
3,KDH Reviews,Please see this and other reviews at KDH Reviews.I enjoyed reading When Love Comes to Town. I believe it provided a candid look at people's true reaction when faced with a loved one's coming out during the early 1990s. Neil's story is touching and Lennon build characters that are truly believable.*** This book was received from Netgalley for review. ***
4,This Novel Is Quite Delightful...,"In ancient Rome, political candidates wore brilliant white togas to set themselves apart from the crowd. The brilliant new novel Snow White Lies stands out from crowd with its many plot twists and surprises as it follows the adventures of Presidential candidate Dan Henry. With real life elections and politicians today seeming stranger than fiction, coming up with interesting new political characters is no easy task. But Snow White Lies meets that challenge with characters from the noble to the dim-witted to the romantic to the downright diabolical. With yet another Presidential election around corner, why not pick up this exciting thriller and get yourself in the mood!"
4,Couldn't put it down,"GREAT STORY! This is one of those books you hate to put down. The publisher does the author, the reader, and itself a disservice, though, by not doing higher quality editing job. I'd have rated this a 5-star book if the editing hadn't been so distracting. Even so, it was a great read and I'm looking forward to reading future books by this author. When can we expect another?"
4,"""Snow White Lies"" - a good read.","Tom Miller's ""Snow White Lies"" is a very creative effort.You have to give Mr. Miller a lot of credit for coming up with the characters and story lines in the book.Perhaps this could be made into an action/thriller movie (or video game) someday.Overall, a good read.Somewhat disappointed with the editing/printing, though; I couldn't help but notice that Champaign Illinois was misspelled (""Champagne""), and my copy of the book was even missing some pages."
1,For beginners ONLY!,"After seeing some of Ed Soph playing on samples of the DVD and reading that it was for beginners to seasoned players, me being a seasoned player, I was interested in it and purchased it, but after seeing it I was VERY dissapointed in it being that it is very basic and should be listed as for beginning players only. I found out that there is a book and cd that this DVD is a supplement to and basicly just talks about what's in the book. So, no need for the DVD."
2,These things are NUTS!,"These things are NUTS... of different sizes.Before I opened the box, I noticed that about 2-3 in each compartment were already coming apart. The little metal springs inside had shaken loose, and were just lying there in the compartment. I suppose I could take those springs and try to screw them back into the nuts, but it makes me skeptical as to whether or not those nuts will fail again. I can't just have my nuts falling apart on me in the middle of a job!In my approximation, with 2-3 bad nuts in each size, that's about a 10% failure rate. That's totally not cool if your nuts only work 90% of the time. Particularly, if they fail weeks or months after the installation, your faulty nuts could cause a fire."
4,Good Assortment,"Has a little bit of everything, good to have around. Good quality. There is a wide range of sizes that can fit a lot of different applications."
3,Just okay.,"This cd has some good swing tunes, but there every song sounds the same, so by track 4, I'm ready to shut it off. I understand that swing music all has the same type rhythm, but there is a bit more variety available, from my experience."
1,"OVER RATED, OVER LONG, OVER BORING","This is NOT the cool soundtrack album that was released in the 1970s. With the exception of track 6 which is by far the best one, the majority of this cd is a long boring snoozefest. If you have a workable turntable I strongly suggest you get the vinyl album. It blows this one away."
2,Only for those who must have every sound track recorded.,"I have not seen the movie, ""Pay It Forward,"" but given composer Newman's reputation in Hollywood, I imagine his music serves it's purpose in keeping the plot and action moving forward. The music on this CD can best be described as rhythmic, atonal, reminiscent of that early 20th century style called ""Twelve Tone;"" that is there are no recognizable melodies or themes --- romantic, soaring, inspiring, invigorating, schmaltzy, or otherwise. I am tempted to call the 20+ tracks, each lasting from 1 to 2 minutes, musical doodles; but I am sure Mr. Newman put a lot more thought and work into this project than what this term might suggest. I have over 150 soundtrack CD's. My own preference lies in the direction of those with indenitfiable themes or melodies. This CD goes in the opposite direction. If it were possible to return a CD after listening to it, this one would have been in the mail a couple of weeks ago."
4,This is a good book to buy.,This book is really darling. It has actual wheels on the book so it can roll across the floor or table. The animal passengers are cute too. Why isn't it a 5 star book? It only does about 4 of the verses out of the possible 10 or so that I know of.
2,"Very cute, but.......","I loved this b ook for my l year old grandson, and he had it about 2-3 weeks when I noticed that the front snap and flap had been chewed up. He loved the book and particularly that the b ook moves all around and he crawled after it. But it didn't hold up to his gumming the book, no teeth yet. I would love to replace the book and give it to him in a few months. I really thought it age applicable, but it did hold up too long. loving grandma"
4,Its a favorite,"My daughter loves this book even though it doesn't sing the entire song. I'll add in a few verses some times and point to things on the pages.I think it does the wheels, horn, driver, the people, the babies, maybe the wipers and then the wheels again."
5,a bible for anyone interested in repairing instruments,"If you are a keen repairer of woodwind instruments or just a player who wants to save a bit of money,this book is a diffinite buy. There are only three books in existance for this field, the second being Brands band Instrument Repair manual. Both of which are as useful as each other.If you work out the cost of having your instrument fixed over a few years, you will automatically see how much you can learn about your intrument and how much you can save.I refer to my copy as my bible and i am sure you will with yours in years to come."
2,Don't Buy this book,"I bought this book to learn how to repair my instruments. This book has a lot of information, but it doesn't teach well. There's plenty of text (273 pgs full of them), but no pictures (i mean there's not enough...it needs more pictures!!!) to complement. I wish there were pictures of the tools so I can visually see through the lengthy text. Most of the visual aids are drawn like 2d cartoon. Don't waste your money like me on buying this book. I wish I can return the book because I don't have the patience to learn instrument repair from this book. I hope this helps your decision for purchasing this book."
2,Connie Francis gets out of Hollywood,"Connie Francis fans around the world would undoubtedly flip over the concept-a CD containing music from Connie's 4 movie film career. Great idea in theory, but the end result is a thinly disguised collection of minor songs from four forgettable movies. Francis' fans will enjoy such rarities as ""Waiting for Billy"" and ""When the Boys Meet the Girls"", but there isn't much to listen to for others. Rhino/TCM's attempt to milk the MGM vaults provides little refreshment. Francis gets lost in the mess of outtakes, instrumentals, and poorly transferred film masters. For demanding fans only. All others go directly to THE VERY BEST OF CONNIE FRANCIS. Greatest treat and brightest highlight:Connie Francis' soaring rendition of ""When the Boys Meet the Girls""."
4,Consistent with expectations,"Works fine. Retractable feature is convenient for travel, though slightly heavy. Would have liked 90 degree angled jacks and longer cable."
4,Inexpensive but reliable,I've been using this cable to listen to my iPod through my car stereo for the past two years. (That's almost as long as I had my last car.) It's worked reliably from the start.
3,Bit flimpsey but still worth money,"Have only had a month, so not sure how the cable will hold up. Connect is good. Have to be careful in re-winding the two ends. I purchased, as I didn't want excess cord hanging from the connector in the car to my MP3 player."
3,You get what you pay for,"This product does fit securely to my ipod and Pioneer car stereo auxillary port. However, the retractable function is not worth the hassle. I bought this because I like to keep things neat and orderly, but it seldolm works the way it should. The sound quality is fine, but the price reflects the quality of the retract wheel function. If you like things neat you may prefer to by a 2' cord and wrap it up yourself. It will save you a bit of a hassle."
4,"Simple, works","Works fine and looks good. Replaces clumsy-looking, overly long straight cable that I had to fold several times and wrap with a bag tie."
3,Cool little gadget,I love that it isn't big and clunky - it fits my Zune which not all MP3 cables do - but I have a hard time getting both sides to retract properly.
2,Compact but keeps retracting.,This product is pretty light and works fine but the wire keeps retracting fully instead of stopping at preset lengths! Thats the major reason why I bought it!!!
3,Decent,"Decent product overall. The retraction mechanism works pretty well it never really got stuck for me. It did end up not working after about two months, but in the cab of my truck my wires get abused so that is not a real surprise.It's decent but I'd suggest spending a little more and getting a higher quality cable."
5,Works perfectly,"Works just as advertised. The sound is great; and the functionality is perfect. Recently purchased; so, still no comment on durability."
1,Broke too soon,I was not impressed with this item. The retracting part of this broke after several months of use. I was able to 'fix' it but it then broke again after a short bit. The cord wouldn't retract into the center piece.After that I just decided to use the cable without the retraction part. After another several months the plastic coating on the cable separated at the point where it contacts the connector - you could see the bare copper wire. After that I threw it away as a loss. Didn't get my money's worth with this one.
3,The product is merely OK and it is very overpriced.,I purchased this item a year ago for $6 dollars on Amazon. The jack snapped and i came back to Amazon to buy a new one and i see it is $20 dollars. No way it is worth that.The retractable mechanism worked for about a month (and not very well i might add). One day i just went to extend the cable inside and the spring inside just snapped and the plastic that surrounded it broke. The cable kept working though and it worked very well up until now. In other words the cable works fine but the retractable mechanism that differentiates this from the other cables is NOT very good at all. I would recommend a cheaper alternative.
5,Good seller good product,"I mistyped my shipping address but Cables Unlimited corrected the problem immediately and re-shipped at no extra cost. They provided great communication and cooperation. When the ZipLinq arrived, it worked fine. I use it to connect my MP3 player to my car stereo. ZipLinq provides a secure connection at both ends, it is easy to adjust the length of the cable and the sound quality is excellent. The retracting cable works smoothly and it makes storage easy and convenient. I hope it lasts a long time."
2,"Lasted a year, then connectors died","The cables didn't retract easily, which wasn't a big deal, but the connectors died after about a year. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Overpriced piece of junk,"This is my second try at this type of cord. I bought it because it looked more durable than the first one I had (a different model). And, I figured (naively) that since it more more expensive, it would be better quality. It was the same piece of junk, but the first one I bought only cost ~$1. So I'm buying a handful of those and I'll just replace them as they fall apart."
4,Cheap product and it works well,I used this product with an IShuffle and connected it to my car. The sound quality is good but not great.
2,Not as advertised,"The cable that I received is the same model number and manufacturer as the one displayed in the picture, but the right angle jack connector is not on each end of the cable that I received. This is the feature that I was seeking to help to prevent the jack from breaking off in the output or input device. I purchased an identical cable last year, and that one has the right angle jack connectors.The photo needs to be updated to match the product, which apparently no longer has this very desirable feature."
2,Good idea. Poor longevity.,"Bought this item in 2008 to connect an iPod touch to a port on my car audio system. Worked pretty much as advertised. But after very infrequent use (once a month maybe), I started noticing recently that only one channel was working (right speaker only). The issue is that a wire had become frayed at one jack-end. So it is now useless. These did not receive rough treatment. The issue seems to be the very thin gauge wire (20 I would guess), which may be good for retractability, but turned out to be bad for durability. So I am back on Amazon now shopping for a replacement. (As a side note, the mechanism to retract the wire isn't exactly easy to use -- it usually takes a full tugs to get it to work right, like a pull-cord on a set of cheap window blinds)."
2,okay cable,"This cable is okay. the cable itself is thin and I would think that it will kink or would be easily damaged. I bought it for only a short-term use, and it served it's purpose. The retractable feature I thought would be nice but if I had to buy this cable over again, I would have bought a normal cable that was heavier and didn't retract. The sound with this cable was fine."
4,Pretty Good,"but not perfect. it, like other retractable cables, gets stuck sometimes and that can be really annoying. but over all, its very convenient and it sounds great. its longer than most other retractable cables and its pretty sturdy. would recommend."
2,"Constantly jams, thin cable",This thing jammed up right out of the package..right now I am just leaving it the same length rather than try to fight it back into position (which I did for a while; it stayed tangled). The cable is also fairly thin. I don't really think this is worth it. In hindsight I wish I had simply purchased a short patch cable.
5,Perfect for the car!!,"Awesome product! Exactly as described. Perfect for the car as you can ""wind it up"" when your done and easily stow it."
2,deceptive advertisement,"This thing is advertised with the 90 degree bent heads. The bend heads is definitely the product I ordered, though when it comes in the mail, the heads are straight. Very disappointing. For the purchase price, it just doesn't seem to be worth returning and stuff. Sad to say, it's a fine retractable cable, but just don't rely on the 90 degree bend. That kinda takes away half the fanciness of this retractable cable if you ask me."
2,Good for a time,I've had this cord for about 2 1/2 years now and up until this time it worked great. The the cord rolls in and out smoothly but just recently it stopped working properly and it will only play from one side of the car.I would have liked for the product to have a greater longevity than 2.5 years... most people own a car and ipod for much longer.
2,a good idea - in theory,"I hate the tangle of earphone cables, and thought this would be perfect. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work - at least for me. I'm not having trouble with the spring-loaded cable rewinder. However, the earbuds don't stay in, the sound is a bit muddy, and the rewinder is in the center of the cables (which, when you think about it, makes perfect sense) - but it's so heavy that you MUST clip it on (to keep the buds from flying out of your ears), and it's not easy to find a place that's exactly in between your pocket and your ears. The clip's also small and awkwardly placed; the cables and rewinder keep getting in the way when trying to clip it. One potentially good thing about it is that the volume comes through way high, at least for me (sansa e280). But this also makes it harder to keep the volume low...I have better luck with my old Kanguru mp3 player that has a lanyard, and built-in earbuds, when doing something active."
1,Save your money,"I bought this as a replacement cable for a pair of noise-reducing headphones. 2 months later, it's trash after daily use 5 days a week at work. I really think it's the retraction mechanism that puts undue wear and tear on the cable itself, which eventually breaks inside and shorts out. The retraction mechanism malfunctioned after the first month, not rolling up evenly on both sides no matter how many times I tried it. I also think the weight of the retraction piece was a bit annoying as well as causing stress on the cable itself. It wasn't too expensive, so while I don't regret experimenting, I would suggest others not bother."
3,its alright,"this cable is ok if you are just looking to save some money. i use it for my car, and i have to turn the volume all the way up to listen to it. i dont mind it too much but kind of a disapointment."
3,Sound is Ok,"The sound quality on this retractable cable just didn't cut it for me. Had a Belkin retractable cable before this one that sounded better, so after about two weeks decided to go back to the Belkin brand. This cable is not a bad quality cable or horrible sounding either its just Ok but there's better ones out there."
1,Failed in First Month,"I used this cable to connect my ipod touch to my car stereo and it failed in less than a month of use. I didn't even move the cable hardly at all. It only plays the left speaker, and not very well. It will cut off completely too."
2,Broken already,It's broken already! The retracting section of it popped open and flipped out the cord after a few months of regular use. I am quite disappointed that it broke so quickly.
4,Not bad at all,It works. Cable is a bit thin but can't tell if there is a loss of sound quality. The length is awesome- back seat drivers can plug in to the car system so that's cool. The retractable feature is great so I don't get a big spaghetti mess in the glove when not in use. I can't say how long it'll keep pulling the cord back in but the mechanism inside actually feels pretty good so we'll see.
5,Smart design,"Used in my car. Retractable design keeps things orderly. Smartly conceived, well executed. Unlike cable I purchased at Walmart for more money, the jack input here is narrow enough to fit my iPhone without removal of the silicone case. Recommended."
4,Good sound; poor comfort and durability,"I have a relatively small head, but the headphones still pinched the top of my ears rather painfully after wearing them for a long time. But overall I still like the headphones because the style is great for when I go running and the sound quality is decent enough for me to enjoy while sitting at my desk. I've always preferred the sound of open-eared headphones though I do find this pair to have a rather weak bass. One last note to bring up: I had the headphones for a year until the plug broke on me. I was really hoping for a more durable product that would last me longer."
4,"Terrific sound quality, wires could be sturdier","I have multiple sets of headphones ($200 Grados on down) and I give them all a workout. The quality of sound in these headphones is as good as (maybe evem better than) the far more expensive Grados. My one complaint is that the wire in the right ear piece has come loose, which means the connection to that side is erratic (works fine if I sit absolutely still, but that doesn't happen too often). The wires probably couldn't handle my wearing them to bed every night. These feel much healthier for my ears than earbuds. I may end up buying another pair but treating the next ones with more respect."
3,Great sound -- uncomfortable and not very portable,"These headphones sound great! But they are very tight and begin to hurt your head after about 10 minutes of wearing them. If you have a small head this may not be a problem. My hat size is average. They also don't fold or have any adjustment making them less portable. Frankly, they are not very nice to look at either."
2,"Best sound quality for lower price point, worst for construction!","On the plus side, these headphones sound amazing - crisp, bassey, clear - for anything from hip hop to classical. I would say they're the best sound I've had from headphones on the cheaper end of the spectrum.On the minus side, the cord is so thin and fragile that it's impossible not to damage them. I've had mine for 7 months using them once a day at the gym - then all of a sudden the sound crackled and dropped out on one of the speakers - then the other - so you're left fidgeting with the cord to hear some sound again. Within the course of an hour, they'd become useless. This is without tugging at the cord or catching it on anything.Overall, I'd say you'll get 6-8 months use out of them, provided you use them at home and don't move them around so much. Handle with care!"
3,"killer sound, killer pain","The good, these things sound really good for a gym class headphone. They fit tight to your head so you can wear them while running, doing sit ups, bench, back extensions... I really like this aspect.The cord is too short. Unless you wear your iPod (or whatever player) on your arm, the cord is not long enough. Also, each headphone has a cord, so if I have my iPod on one side or the other the cord from the opposite side pulls (if that makes sense). They become very uncomfortable after 50 - 60 minutes on your head. When I say uncomfortable, I mean they hurt bad enough I just take them off for 15 minutes or so and then wear them for the last 20 minutes. Lastly, I will reiterate, they do sound good, but I think they are a bit overpriced for what they are."
2,comfortLESS,"I WON'T SAY THAT THESE DON'T PRODUCE GREAT SOUND, BUT THEY ARE SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT WHO WOULD WANT TO LISTEN TO MUSIC WEARING THEM. TRY THEM ON BEFORE YOU BUY"
3,Weak plug,Perhaps I'm just a little too rough with my headphones but the left channel died on me twice caused by a bad connection at the plug end. The first time this happened was a month after I purchased them and Grado Labs graciously repaired them for free. The second time happened a few months later and I'm not too happy. I'm going to bring them to a repair shop and ask that the plug be repaired and reinforced somehow. I love the sound and I've learned to live with the tight fit but the wire is incredibly thin and the plug may be weak. The fact that I'm going to get them repaired a second time shows how attached I am to them.
2,I Refuse to Title My Review,"These headphones are EXTREMELY uncomfortable. I can't wear them for more than a few minutes. The sound quality is decent for the price, but doesn't seem to have much low-end. I'd been using cheaper JVC earbuds before I picked these up, and I'll probably just end up getting another pair of those to replace these.JVC HAFX66B Air Cushion Headphones (Black)"
1,Great if you like having your head crushed.,"These headphone sound very good. But the person that designed the head band must have been at the bottom of his class. The second I put them on, I realized I would not be able to use them. The head band puts an incredible amount of pressure directly onto your head at the points directly behind the ears. There are no adjustments, so you can't do any thing about it. The engineer that designed the head band must be a complete imbecile. Or he has ears that stick out a mile, which would be the only way these headphones would not crush your head. The management at Grado must have approved these without ever trying them on. Some advise for the engineer responsible for these. Go get a job as a Walmart greeter. Engineering is not for you."
5,Best Sound Quality in Portable Headphones...Period.,"Have listened to tons of headphones and these are superior is sound quality. Only qualms are the not so comfortable design, flimsy wire, and loud sound for people sitting next to you on the bus.My only concern is sound quality, everything else is secondary. And when it comes to clarity these are the best."
3,Uncomfortable,"The sound is fine, but not enough padding around the ears to be truly comfortable. I wound up getting a Sony set that are so very comfy.I'd think twice."
3,"Great sound, disposable construction","The sound fantastic and they are really comfortable on my ears. However, the connecting wires are so thin, I'm almost afraid to use them on the go. I contacted Grado about this and was assured that the wires were covered under their one year warranty- providing there was no abuse- whatever that means. Buy these for the amazing sound, but not for durability."
2,Way too tight.,I love the sound of Grados but it doesn't matter how good they sound if they aren't comfortable and these are way too tight.
2,igrado,"Relatively good sound quality and excellent styling. However, some noise leaks out and the build quality is a bit suspect as I've had two of these now fail in the area of the pin. It seems after a couple of years of normal usage the wiring inside breaks and one of the two channels fails."
2,"Great Sound, Didn't Fit","I looked forward to using these headphones as an improvement over the buds you get with the ipod nano. But when I wear them the way that is dipicted on the photo in the carton they fit so snugly on my ears that they muffle the sound. When I turn them upside down they fit loosely enough for a beautiful pristene sound but they feel uncomfotable to the point where I'm constantly thinking about them or trying to adjust them. Maybe the reason they fit so tightly on my ears muffling the sound is because I have a big head, I don't know. From the reviews I thought this was a sure purchase, but it wasn't. Oh well, another $50 down the drain. I'll have to go back to the buds. Sorry."
3,No HYPE involved!,"Superb performance as promised. Lightweight, economical, and comfortable. Only...one must not care about sound ""leakage"" beyond one's own ears: most everything that is played at the preferred volume on my mp3 can be heard up to 20 feet away. Addendum: Sadly, however, after about one year of conscientious use, the connection at the plug has failed such that stereo is no longer reliable. Repair is likely impossible. A new unit has been ordered and the rather flimsy wire at the plug will be reinforced (with Gorilla Glue) as has been done to other headphones, with good, durable effect."
3,Great sound but uncomfortable for this glasses wearer,"I have owned many pairs of headphones over the years, including another Grado product, theGrado Prestige Series SR-60i Padded Headphones. I have no quibble with the sound quality of either of the Grado headphones, but I can only wear the iGrado for an hour at the most before they really start to cause discomfort.Now, I do wear glasses which I think contributes to the problem, as the pressure of the phones via the headband is directly over the arms of my glasses. I had hoped that the pressure of the headband would let up over time, but it has not.If you are a glasses wearer, then I would recommend that you look at a different product."
3,Poor high's & snapped the first day,"I had read a number of reviews listing that the iGrado's didn't have the greatest high frequency reproduction, but I wanted to give them a shot These were to be for casual use so I was hoping it wouldn't be that noticeable. I was looking for a wrap around neck style. The headphones seemed muffled and the bright highs were barely there. Tolerable yes, but not nearly as good at my cheap ear buds.But then I went to put them on my head for a second listen, and SNAP, the neckband snapped into two. I have an average size head (7"" hat size) but they sqeezed my head so tight that the iGrado's would have been tight on my 6yr old. I was putting them over my ears and the band snapped in half.I was going to give them a shot, but not with their build quality.Sound wise = passable.Build Quality = poor"
4,Best inexpensive cans for Ipod /MP3 Players,"You just are not going to find a better sounding pair of phones for under $100. While the neckband style fit may not be for everyone,these really make the most out of the compressed music files on portable players. The i-Grado's ability to expand the sound stage really makes the difference.Nice!"
4,Writing wins the day,"(Editor: I wrote an earlier review before I read your advisory. Here is another try.) The story line is rather basic, the ending a little too sweet. But I was swept along by Carroll's crisp writing style. Situation, character, action, and implications are conveyed in a free flow of short, simple sentences. As a native, I feel his settings in San Francisco and Northern California are right on. His main character is alien to my experience. But he rang true and I came to care about his frantic kill-or-be-killed crusade."
2,aliens take over yet again,"I bought this book, despite the cliche storyline, because the cover made it sound like it was going to be humorous, tackling an overused plot with comdedy.It lied to me. There were maybe 5 jokes in the whole thing. Maybe it should have been a thousand-word short story instead."
2,Top Dog it isn't,"Jerry Jay Carroll was a new author to me; so I ordered Top Dog and Inhumam Beings at the same time. I'm glad I read Top Dog first. Inhuman Beings is just another so-so ""alien's have landed"" yarn. A couple of the characters are interesting; but funny, this book is not. I kept thinking that this is just a book written to catch the eye of Hollywood."
5,Sounds very different,Very interesting to listen to and does not gel with the many stories told by others. Well worth buying
4,"A different, more intelligent approach","An updated version of Integrity Selling, this is a great book for trainers and sales people who operate above gimmicks and hard sell tactics. An intelligent read with good core principles and solid direction for professional selling with integrity."
5,I can do this!,"Selling can seem so complicated. This book outlines a simple approach that I know I can use time and time again In fact, I applied the principles and saw increased sales in my first two weeks. I'm buying it for everyone on my team!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I found nothing of value in this book. If you are looking for a newer sales model, you would be better off looking at Unlock the Game by Ari Galper."
5,TRULY INSPIRING BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS PROBABLY THE MOST MOVING, INSIGHTFUL, INFORMATIVE AND EMOTIONAL THAT I HAVE EVER READ ON MEDIUMSHIP AND SPIRITUALITY. I AM A RELATIVE NOVICE IN THIS ARENA AND FOUND IT TO BE SO EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND, ADDRESSING SO MANY TOPICS ABOUT WHICH I AM CURIOUS. IT ENCOURAGES YOU TO LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF AND AROUND YOU IN THE SEARCH FOR ANSWERS ABOUT LIFE, BOTH HERE AND AFTER. I WAS VERY MOVED EMOTIONALLY BY BOTH RUTH'S OWN EXPERIENCES AND HOW SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SO MANY OTHERS. THANK YOU RUTH FOR SHARING YOURSELF WITH EVERYONE PRIVILIGED ENOUGH TO READ YOUR BOOK."
2,A Let Down,"This book was a let down. The author jumbled information, contradicted herself on more than one occasion and gave a lot of ""evidence"" without any validation. Majority of this book is her experiences and boosting. This book wasn't worth the time, there are far better books on this subject out there."
5,A must by,"This is a must-get CD if you like Emma Shapplin music. Sting did one song and it's a wonderful song! The album is a mix of rock, opera, and somewhat new age. It's worth a buy."
5,Living A Dream,Great book! This is a well written book that puts you on the edge of your seat. You feel as if you are on the boat traveling with the writer. Looking forward to the next book!
2,Ego Just Too Much,"Being hooked on cruising tales, I zipped through this one in under a week. The story of 2 naval officers taking off on a boat together really puts them heads and tails over the rest of us who are thinking about the cruising life - they were trained for this very thing! As a result, they seemed to breeze through difficult aspects of cruising and the book was more about her struggle to let go of her former life in the spotlight. Suzanne's big ego and constant need for affirmation got old and tiresome. There's better books about 'living the dream' out there."
3,sailing adventure,This book was disappointing to me because the author didn't share much about the actual sailing aspect of her and her husband's brief adventure together from Maryland to Nova Scotia.
4,High expectations,"I had wanted this book for a long time. I have read a lot of sailing adventures and thought that this would be a great book for a modern look at sailing from a women's perspective that wasn't from the 70's, 80's or 90's (even though those are excellent adventures!) but there wasn't as much about the cruising as I had hoped. But I did enjoy reading about where they cruised. You don't read often about sailing up there."
3,"Way overpriced, do not buy unless you need them","There plugs cost about 4x more than what I am used to paying. I think it's called highway robbery in some circles.That having been said they do help IF YOU HAVE A SUPERCHARGED MUSTANG OR NITROUS INJECTED MUSTANG. THAT'S IT. There is no HP gain by using these plugs in a N/A engine, so don't let your buddy talk you into buying a set because he heard you can get more power outta them... you can't!Other than that, these are the hardest plugs to install, torque them at 25 lbs and gap them between 32-38 (depends on boost or nitrous shot size).Oh and you have to buy a special gapper, the old style won't work, trust me!"
3,too long,"The remover is a great idea, but it was too long and tapered to too much of a point, so that it didn't fit into the bushing I was removing. The point went past the bushing and hit the back of the crankshaft before the fat part was able to be screwed into the bushing. I had to cut the tool in half removing the pointy part. Once I did that though it worked great and the bushing popped right out. Without this tool I would have had to chisel it out."
5,Great book!,"This is my favorite book of Gary Snyder's poetry, although I am a fan of his prose too. Every poem and even the order is solidly in his simple, profound style that does such a great job of observing the (often humorous) details of life and how they fit into a universe that makes just enough sense."
4,A Wild Justice,"I decided to write this review after reading Ms. Ranstrom's second book, and the reason I did was that I thought that readers should be aware that we have a delightful new author who will keep us entertained and enchanted for years to come. As she continues to develop her unique style, who knows where Ms. Ranstrom will end up. I, for one, can not wait to see what she does next, and of course I will always look forward to more of the Wednesday Legue."
1,Very disappointing,"This book was such a disappointment, totally amaturish in nature, plot was very week and stiff. It is not a book that I could recommend to anyone, I considered it a waste of time and money to even buy it.The plot is unprofessional, just wanders and wanders thru and is so predictable! ..."
5,Awesome Christmas CD,"Set the mood perfectly and was exactly what I was looking for! Sounds very ""old school"" and '50s Christmas. Very glad I purchased."
4,"Attractive and sturdy, but not easy","I own dozens of ""Melissa & Doug"" toys for my children and they are all fabulous. This one though, as the other reviewer stated, is fairly difficult to use for younger children. The pieces stack on little pegs, but the pegs are slightly off center, so they will only stack facing one direction. My kids lose interest fairly quickly with this one because they take it apart and then can't put it back together again."
1,Not as pictured,"My 3-year-old son recieved this toy for his first birthday, and I ordered it for a first birthday party we're attending this weekend. I specifically ordered from this seller and paid about 40% more because the item they have pictured is the older model that my son has, not the patterned newer version sold everywhere else. The older version of the toy is bigger and more substantial, and doesn't have the sharp corners and cheap, sloppy paint and look of the new version. I was very disappointed when the package arrived, and I recieved the newer model. Now it's too late to order something else for the party, so I will have the added hassle of going to a store to find a gift, as well as returning the toy. Sellers need to be honest about the product they're selling!"
3,"Good, with drawbacks.","We've had this toy through two of our toddlers now. I agree with other posters, putting these together is frustrating for little ones. And after awhile, the pieces start to come apart. Not a problem if you keep wood glue available, but still a maintenance issue. As a pull toy, the entire thing is a bit heavy and unwieldy. The best use of this toy is assebling just the giraffe so my toddler can pull it. Unlike many pull toys, the string is nice and long. Good for use, but also a possible strangulation hazard. I love Melissa and Doug products, but this isn't my favorite."
5,Fun & Learning,"First: This product is bigger than I expected, it might be somewhat difficult for a wobbly toddler to carry it around. But it's colorful and eyecatching. And unlike most pull along toys it can be used as a construction toy too. The pieces are big enough for little hands to handle and putting it together is fun and fairly easy, so your little one won't get frustrated."
5,A Must for every MOM!!!,"Moments With God for African American Mothers is a wonderful collection of prayers that represents mothers of all ages. Ramona VanMeter Benson's spirituality flows throughout each poem. I was so inspired as I began to read, I could not put it down! What a terrific gift idea for every mother!"
1,Overpriced textbook,"As the author of this book, I am very upset and embarrassed about the high price tag Cengage has put on it. As department chair in my department, I have urged my faculty currently using the textbook to shift to some other.-- David McMurreydavidm@austincc.edu"
5,Great Wallet,"I purchased this a couple of years ago and it is still holding up! Very good quality and small, but carries a lot. I'm trying to find a couple more to buy in case this one gives out, but so far it is still doing great."
4,Included in my course syllabus,"I have been teaching construction documents to interior designers at Parsons School of Design for the past three years. The Wiggins Book is one of the two prime texts included in my course bibliography. The sheet by sheet instruction are very clear and show the process of putting together a set of drawings. I don't always follow the same standards as Wiggins, but it's the best that's out there. As previously commented, not recommended for residential or specialty interiors projects. Very good reference for general commercial construction documents."
1,Save Yourself the Trouble and Look Elsewhere,"I received this item as a Christmas present, and before I even had the chance to use it, the LED lights shorted out. The instructions direct you to insert the provided 9V battery and test the light. Well, the light came on for all of 1 second and then quit. I tried a new 9V battery to no avail.To make things worse, the seller, ""As Seen on TV"", refuses to exchange the product and have been a nightmare to deal with. Stay away from both the product and seller!"
1,dont buy this,"i bought this produce at a local walmart store, it was 15$ so i thought i would give it a try anyway... it may only be 15$, but thats exactally what i lost... dotn try this, it doesnt work at all!"
4,"Very Good, Not Great","For clarification, if Amazon provided half stars, I'd give this three and a half.All the discussion about Mr. Marsalis is unnecessary. He and TB are both contemporary Jazz trumpeters but that's where the similarity ends.This is a fine session, the band is loose throughout and there's a very good selection of songs here, half of them TB originals and half of them covers (though no ""standards""). On a couple of songs the playing almost moves a little too close to Smoothe Jazz territory for my comfort. However, for example on ""passionate Courage"", Aaron Parks' excellent piano playing salvages the song.Altogether an enjoyable listen, though by no meams a classic. (Thankfully Mr. Blanchard avoids the tendency to include exercises in screeching dissonance to obtain ""credibility"" among some of the critical circles.)"
3,"Good, but not great...","The compositions on this album are great. The musicians too, are very good - especially drummer eric harland and pianist aaron parks but blanchard's playing leaves a LOT to be desired. First of, the horns on this recording sound like they were recorded in a bathroom or echo chamber - the reverb is just too much. Secondly, blanchards playing seems less than inspired and frankly I thought I'd enjoy the album more if his solos were cut out. I won't articulate why I feel that way - it's only a matter of opinion, after all, aye? Ultiamtely the CD over all is pretty strong though. Again, the compositions are great and sound quality is very good too."
2,TERENCE G.,"If I wanted to listen to smooth jazz I would just find the lame station here in NOLAMr. Blanchard suns one in live venues, but the last few longplayers have slud down todis and not ever going to rebound. Please Mister throw us something like real Jazz??"
1,bad choice,"My seven year old daughter received this toy for Christmas. She chose very carefully since she was only getting one toy. She was so excited and couldn't wait to do all of the things the horse is advertised to do. She just received her first lesson in false advertising. She is upstairs sobbing because she became so frustrated with everything she tried to do. The straightener is ineffective for coloring the horse's head, the hair clips are very hard to close, the hair is all tangly and the tiara is too small for her head (and doesn't stay on the horse's head very well either.) I can't believe that a toy at this price would be so cheap. I guess I learned my lesson also. Please, do not make the same mistake."
4,Silly and fun purple horse with fancy hair.,"My 5 year old daughter received this gift for Christmas and loves it. Yes, the hair is pretty tangly, but it is just fun and different. She loves braiding the hair, and we have been having fun playing together making silly hairstyles. Not a lot of educational value, but lots of fun mother and daughter time. We have had no trouble getting the hair color to change. We even made multi color hair streaks."
2,I wouldn't buy this toy again,"This was the ""must have"" toy for my daughter this year. What a disappointment! Forget the color changing, we couldn't get any of that to work. But my major complaint about this toy is the hair! It tangles worse than any other toy hair I've ever seen. Most Barbie hair tangles but this is the worst yet. My daughter is 7 and not able to brush it or get the knots out without my help. As soon as she trys another style, its a tangles mess again and frizzier than the last time. The hair on this toy is supposed to be its reason to be, but it is awful. I'd think that Mattel would put hair in a hair styling toy that could withstand manipulation and would be easy to play with. After all, they market their products to little girls, not adults. I'd return it if I think she'd let me!"
4,Its such a beautiful toy,"This toy is really beautiful. My three year old got it for Christmas. She is a little too young to realize that it is a little difficult to get the hair and makeup to change color with the warm/cold temperature but she likes to brush the hair, place the jewels on it, and pretend to apply makeup. I actually sat down and had fun with it for about an hour, braiding and brushing and decorating it this morning. It is way better than the Barbie head I had when I was a kid."
2,Disappointed and Frustrated,"My daughter (5)had wanted this toy for her birthday for 2 months. When she received it she was all ready to change the hair color and put on the ""eyeshadow"". Neither worked very well. The directions say don't freeze the iron but I was never able to get the water cold enough and as for the eyes I had to use an ice cube to make it reappear. For what we bought it for this toy ended up leaving both my daughter and me disappointed and frustrated."
1,Save your money,"This toy looks great in the commercials, but it is difficult to change her hair color, there are tiny pieces that can be easily lost, and it is not worth the money. For $30 my daughter (4 years old) played with it once and never touched it again. Save your money and buy something worthwhile."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my 5 year old. Although easy to use and fun to play with, braiding hair, etc. the color changing hair is challanging. The instructions tell you not to freeze the iron but it's virtually impossible to get the iron cold enough without doing so. It also takes a long time to turn back. Not much makeup to play with either. My daughter played with it once and hasn't picked it up since."
1,Bad idea,"Santa brought this toy. I knew it would be a huge waste of money, so I would have never bought it myself. The ""pony that was just a head"" was the one toy my daughter had to have and wrote Santa about. (She's 5.) She never even played with it, even once. One of her friends played with it for about 5 minutes and broke or lost all of the parts (just the nature of the toy, not the child). My daughter could have cared less. No big surprise here. The reviews are on base as they usually are. And, the crown for the child is a joke. The 2 crowns are too big for a the horse and literally half the size of a child's head. Mattel had great commerials for this and Santa probably delivered a pile of these. However, I bet Santa didn't deliver anything to those Mattel Executives! Shame on them for stealing from children at Christmas by using a slick add to sell a piece of junk! (I know, I know, it's Mattel.)"
1,I wouldn't buy this,My daughter saved her money up to get this since she 1st saw it a few months back. She is 6yrs. The hair barely changes colors and it takes extremely cold water to do it (we put an ice cube in ours). It also takes a long time to get it to change which is frustrating for her. I wouldn't recommend it. It isn't worth its price.
1,Very disappointing,"My 5-year old daughter begged us for this toy. We finally bought it for her only to find out it was a huge disapointment, to all of us.This toy is an example of fabulous advertising applied to a low quality yet rather expensive product. The jewel decorations can be applied only once, only to later fall off. The hair color change requires ultra cold water, and more effort than it's worth. And there's no chance of the crown to fit any child's head.I'm sure the steep price of the toy takes into consideration the vast number that will be returned."
3,"Very overpriced, but your child will enjoy it","My 7 year old daughter saved her money to purchase this. I would never have paid $30.00 for it after reading the other reviews, which are all accurate, but she desperately wanted it. The hair color comes in pink and we used icecubes to change it to purple, the ""curling iron"" does not work. Icewater works for the eyeshadow. I'm sure this will be drastically reduced as time goes by, wait and get it for $20.00 or less."
3,"Ok toy, too expensive","My daughter used her gift card for this. I was surprised it was $30 and not closer to $20. I fondly remember my Barbie head you could put makeup on when I was little so got this for her.VERY disappointing how the mane and eyeshadow don't really change color. I wouldn't let my daughter put on the gloss on her as it smells terrible. The jewels lose their stickiness all too quick. I will have to get more to myself so she can play with it more. The crown is unwearable as it is so tiny and as she says ""hurts my head"". I did find that if you put your child's hair in a bun on top first then it will go around it fine.Overall, I will see if she wants to get something else and leave it up to her if we return it. I would but she IS enjoying playing with it."
2,Not worth the money,"I got this toy for my 4 yr old daughter. The first time she tried to change the color of the eyeshadow, the color came off the face, so she couldnt do anything with it. She was so upset. As the other reviews stated, it is difficult to change the color of the hair. I would not recommend this product - certainly not worth the 30.00 !!!!"
1,save your money-,"This toy is a waste of money. The hair does not change color, the jewels do not stick more than once, and the crown is way too small. I would have never bought this toy , but my 4 year old begged me. She still enjoys brushing her hair, but that is about it. Buy something else!"
2,barbie pegasus,Overall my daughter liked the product but it was not that easy to change the hair color. You are supposed to fill the curling iron with ice cold water to change the color from pink to purple. If the tempature isn't ice cold it doesn't work. As soon as the water warms up for just a few minutes it stops. The same can be said for the eye shadow. My daughter lost interest in these features after trying it a couple of times. She did enjoy brushing the pony's hair.
5,"on the ""indispensable"" shelf among parenting books","The author's positive and practical approach helps you to see the good in your ""spirited"" child, to craft situations which ""work"", and to advocate for your child. I rate this book among my top five picks for parents-to-be and parents of 0-5 year olds."
4,A helpful book but not a cure all,"This book was amazingly insightful. It let me know that I am not the only parent who has a handful...of love. I have always know that my son was different, in a good way, but was concerned with his level of energy and it's effects in school. I am learning that a large amount of information is available and I encourage you to look into the foods your child consumes, talk with teachers, doctors and friends. I found there could be allergies or it could be ADHD (an exhausted brain from over functioning)that may keep your child from learning in a traditional school setting."
3,Todd Edwards - Full On (Volume 2),"Todd Edwards has a knack for creating uplifting, funky garage music using nothing more than a nice two-step beat and a few vocal samples. In this, he resembles Akufen in his creative use of samples (although Edwards relies almost entirely the gospel/R&B side of things). However, his album FULL ON, VOLUME 2 also reveals his weakness: after a while, all his tracks start to sound the same. The tempo doesn't vary, so the onus of the track lies on the sample, and if the sample isn't memorable... well, there's trouble ahead. So while tracks like ""Shut the Door,"" ""Beckon Call,"" and ""Restless Soul"" have some sparkle to them, many of the other tracks just don't distinguish themselves. So while Edwards' musical abilities seem limited, he's able to change things up enough to keep things moving. Perhaps a better album to dance to than to listen at home."
4,I read this to my baby cousin,"I read this book to my new baby cousin, Andrew Stadulis. He liked the pictures a lot. His eys even knew how to look at one page and then look at another page. I had one of these dogs. They are called Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. My dog looked like the dog who was the leader playing Hide and Seek. The pictures in this book are really great. The words are really easy to read and are printed really big so little kids can see them really, really clear. But, the story is sort of stupidish. I really like Harry Potter better, no offence. But I think it is a good book for a baby or little kid. You should buy this book."
5,"Soft, Soothing, & Relaxing",Another CD that I will treasure. Especially enjoy it while driving in the California traffic
5,Great collection of songs by an underrated musician,"Paul Gilbert is probably best known for being the lead guitarist for Mr Big, but this album showcases his musical talents, quirky sense of humor, vocal abilities ... and searing riffs. Wonderful to rock out to with the top down on a summer's day! Paul avoids the common temptation for any virtuoso - letting skill get in the way of the music - and delivers a solid collection of singable, rocking songs, with some lovely acoustic ballads and the occasional hilarious lyric."
5,Best band I've heard in a long time,"If you get easily bored by heavy metal macho posers in the vein of Black Sabbath and believe in the power of punk pop, give this band a spin.This is no hype, I doubt if they ever get any recognition, but if they did it would be very well deserved."
4,Model Shop or Eventide?,"While it would be nice to say we have a previously unreleased album by the original Spirit, it wouldn't be exactly true. For the most part this is another version of the vinyl album Sundazed released a couple of years ago called ""Eventide"" combined with the version of Fog from their companion Sundazed album ""Now Or Anywhere"". Five of the songs were also released on the retrospective CD ""Time Circle"". Aren't You Glad doesn't really add anything to the originaly released version. Not to say this isn't a very good CD. The fact that they could write such great music for such a godawful movie is a tribute to their talent. These songs really showcase the talents of John Locke, both as a performer & a songwriter, like none of Spirit's other albums. This CD is worth having, just be aware that almost all of this material has been available before."
3,I know why it was kept in the vault for 35 years!!,I much anticipated the arrival of Model Shop only to be diasappointed with it. I was expecting more than pedestrian soundtrack music I guess. It has some moments but they are few and far between. I am a Spirit fan but this is disappointing and the description is a bunch of hype. As a die hard Spirit fan I am glad to have it but it will not get played a lot.That is just my opinion.
2,Very Disappointing CD-where is the Spirit Rock N Roll?,"I agree with the other reviewer-this CD should not have been released -most of it is instrumental with no vocals and slow jazz that puts you to sleep--a little like the instrumentals on the Clear Album but not as good. One of the two vocal tracks is Aren't you Glad from the 2nd album-the notes says this version is unreleased but it sure sounds like the cut on the 2nd album.The rest of the album means nothing and goes nowhere--this will sit on my shelve only because I am a collector and I like the album design and notes, pictures. If you are not a collector, forget this one----------"
1,I wonder what happened?,I hate to say anything negative here but to be fair this needed a lot of work. The idea was promising but the execution fell short.
5,Awesome,"Women and Wealth is not just for the beginner. It is for those of us who have been in business for awhile, as if (and I can just hear Dr. Pat saying), after driving for ten or more years, we all need to re-read the drivers manual!"
4,swing trading,"The book is good - it covers all the basics, but it does NOT teach how to trade successfully. It simply gives the basic info necessary to begin to learn to trade successfully. It does not give step by step (minute by minute) instructions on how to be successful. If this is all you read, you will probably not earn much in the markets."
3,interesting but slightly annoying,"Good info for beginners, something to learn for most inexperienced traders. I read everything I can on trading, there's always something to learn. This book is a bit simplistic, a bit repetitive, and most of all, has weird unnecessary self-help positve thinking crap throughout. Plus the annoying 'yikes' 'eek' etc commentaries on the charts. If you can get past her style, there's some educational stuff here. Her chapter on candlestick charting is best left unread- buy Nisson's books instead and get the whole picture correctly. I think she makes her money writing, not trading- as they say, them that can't do- teach."
3,Disappointed,"I thought Turners book was merely a discussion of technical analysis with one example trade thrown in for good measure. Sure, there are some good tips but the book only costs $US10.85 and I believe you only get what you pay for.I think the best book for beginners on the subject of technical analysis is ""Mastering Technical Analysis: Using the tools of technical analysis for profitable trading"" by John C Brooks. Brooks' book is clear, concise and very rudimentary.I think the best books for beginners on the subject of trading are ""Trading Secrets"" by Louise Bedford and ""Charting Secrets"" by Louise Bedford. Bedford is an achieved trader in Australia and her books are clear, concise and very genuine. Her books can be found at her website. Go to [...] then select shop then select books."
1,I feel somewhat taken...,"This book is decent for a beginning active trader. It is easy to read and it is not a costly investment. However, her broad topics culminate in one ending example of trades of Juniper (JNPR). JNPR's behavior at the time was a total aberration and a result of the irrational hype of the internet boom. It was not a ""real"" example that a beginning trader would encounter. Then I signed up for her newsletter at her website which she touts in her book. All I received in two months were solicitations to buy books through her website. Although I respect her knowledge, you get the feeling that a majority of her income is from speaking engagements and bilking people like me out of $15 to buy her book. There are other authors who make a majority of their income through trading, I hope you can find one of those."
1,Some practical advice amidst many commonplaces,"This is a foolish and insulting book that reads more like new age evangelism than investment counseling. Between paeans exulting readers to make their souls sing and focus on the truth of their being, we are treated to pearls of wisdom like 'Stock prices only move three directions--up, down, and sideways.' (Italics and dubious grammar in the original.) It's chief virtue is its relatively low price, but anyone seriously interested in the subject would do better to spend the extra money and buy Farley or Sarkovich."
5,"Easy to Read, Easy to Follow","Awesome book. Easy to understand. Of course, prior to reading this, I read many other trading books, so I was already familiar with much of the terminology. It cleared up some things I didn't quite understand in a more simplistic language than the other books I was reading. It summarizes trading in relatively few pages. If you want more in-depth knowledge of a specific strategy, then you'll have to buy other books. It's a great beginner book. My husband and I are making money, not guessing but using the technical analysis she uses. We have gotten more heavily into candlesticks and love it. She explains it fairly simply. Good book. She is a good writer. We also purchased her Day Trading book. Both books are similar."
5,The Best Beginner's Book Yet,"As a trader who has been barely breaking even during the past 3 years, I found this book to be the one which turned my trading business into a highly profitable venture. It bills itself as a beginner's guide, and although that's what it is, for the less serious trader, it may the only book they would ever need. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning to trade properly and profitably."
4,Good reading for beginning/intermediate traders,"Easy to read, gets technical without going overboard. Nice touch to keep going back to the psychology of trading as well. However, in her stock selection criteria she recommends using industry/group leaders from IBD (Investor's Business Daily). That would severely limit your trading opportunities and confuses trading with investing, something newbies should be VERY clear on. A good starting point but if you are serious buy additional books as others here have suggested."
5,Perfect Summer Hat!,"I love these hats, and my boys actually wear them! Bought the green and the blue sharks, and they are cute as can be, fit great, dry quickly, protect from the sun, stay on, and are reversible. What more could you ask for? Love 'em!"
5,Garmin Nuvi 250 a Good Purchase!,"I gave a lot of consideration to which Garmin Nuvi navigator to purchase. Living in Southeastern Michigan, I believed the chance of traveling to or through Canada was likely enough to spend a little extra (at the time I made my purchase, I was able to buy the 250 for just a few dollars more than the 200) for maps for all of North America. The unit is easy to use and it works very well. I am very pleased with my Garmin Nuvi 250!"
2,Ugly interface,Compared to TomTom (any model) Garmins has very ugly and user-unfriendly interface. I personally tried nuvi and returned it.
4,Great Value,"Well worth the money. I have an in-dash system that came with my Acura TL, but I needed this model for rental cars. I actually prefer it to my car's system."
3,Garmin Nuvi 250 3.5 inch GPS not for new road users.,This product does not show any road names or spell any road names.When you travel on a ramp you are not sure it does not guide you properly. Warning is done at .2miles and cannot be configured.
3,"Old map, delayed direction","You have to be aware that this unit comes with an old map. You have to download a new map and install it yourself. The download takes about 2 hours, and the installation takes another 2. Even the updated map is not very accurate. At one time it told me to turn into a one way in the wrong direction.Sometimes the direction given is too slow. I already passed the exit when the direction was given.But overall it is a nice unit. I like the fact that you can take it with you and put it in your pocket."
2,A Wild Ride,"I have learned to question this gizmo more often than not. I have been on long wild rides and great adventures that never got me to my real destination. I'm still wondering if it can be updated online. For very basic local directions it is fairly reliable, though it can take me the long way and it goes nuts when I go the way I know; ""recalculating . . . recalculating"". I'm glad to have some help getting around, since I'm new to Asheville, but I have to be mindful of its questionable reliability."
4,Garmin GPS,"I received this product in a timely matter. Great condition. Perfect size, can fit in your pocket or a purse. Very easy to use. I'm not very good with technology, but find this very easy to follow."
5,Great basic GPS,Perfect for someone who needs an affordable basic GPS. It has all the features that you need to get from point A to point B and all stops in between. Simple to use and easy to follow. Highly recommended.
4,Garmin nuvi 250,First I must point out that this is the first G.P.S. unit I've owned of any kind.TheGarmin nüvi 250 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator (English/French Version)is a simple to use G.P.S. Navigation device that I've used several times so far since buying it and I'd recommend it as a starter unit to anyone interested in getting a G.P.S. or as a low cost alternative to one of the more expensive models if you are on a budget.
4,Worth the Price,The title says French/English and people think it is different from English version. But it is not. I have been using the American-English accent without any problem. It is not as good as my Nuvi-350 but is really worth the price you pay.
5,Love my Garmin Nuvi 250 portable GPS!,"The Garmin Nuvi 250 was recommended to us. Purchased our GPS on amazon.com - great price/fast delivery. We took 3 trips out of state, was great for directions to motels/food/attractions. Perfect for miles/time to destination! Don't know what we did before Gertie (our name for the GPS). We even listened in Swedish to learn a few new words from my husband's heritage."
4,Garmin 250,"In my opinion Garmin nuvi 250 is a very good product. The estimated arrival time to my destinations has been very accurate so far and it had been able to find most of my destinations. I work on the road all the time and it helps me to find really good shortcuts that before having Garmin I was not aware of. The only ting that I am not so thrilled about is that it needs to be plugged all the time to the AC connector/charger because its battery does not last long if it is not connected.Also, if you are thinking on buying this product go ahead and by the upgrade. If you live in a big city, the maps in Garmin 250 might not have the newest streets or new highways uploaded. I might go for it as well pretty soon."
4,Garmin 250 GPS,"Buy it. I havent used a lot of other GPS units but my wife and I are real happy with this unit. Guys, this device could be one of the greatest gifts you could give to your spouse! It sure was for me, my wife can't stop thanking me for getting it for her for Christmas. She wanted an Ipod, but I knew she would like this better. You get to use it too! Great family gift. Love the talking voice and great for taking trips and finding restaurants and gas stations. Not every street is loaded, I need to find out if there is an update to download. Real happy with unit though. The next bigger screen model would be good also but the 250 is fine."
4,Great Investment,We purchased this for my husband for work. He goes on road calls throught the area and needs the quickest route. I did take it on vacation and it only missed on one turn. It is just the right size to tuck in my glovebox. I would recommend the Garmin Nuvi 250 to anyone.
4,"My charmin' Garmin takes me for a ride---recalculate, anyone?","still some ""glitches"" which we ""locals"" ignore; absence of many Jewish houses of worship in the ""places of interest""; unclear instructions for setting displays; eg: emphasizing time of arrival; or to speed up simulating route.Overall, I like the product; but can't wait to see if it's an improvement over the last time I was in ""dahn tahn"" Pittsburgh, when my old GPS went nuts.I also appreciate Amazon's prices and convenience for comparison shopping! and free shipping!"
3,Disapointing GPS navigation device,"After reading a lot of good feedback, I bought this device. It was very easy to use, but its voice navigation was terrible. It also lacked some basic features compared to Tom Tom. I returned the device and bought Tom Tom. I am very happy with Tom Tom, which has much better voice navigation and more features than Garmin."
3,Not user friendly,Not user friendly. It was difficult to program address and switch between driver to pedestrian setting.
1,"Nuvi 250 Mexico; lousy Mexico maps, no U.S. maps at all","Amazon says that the Nuvi 250 Mexico comes with both U.S. and Mexico maps; it does not have any U.S. maps at all. The maps of Mexico, Tampico comes to mind, are terrible. We were routed the wrong way down one way streets, and sent through the docks. No toll roads were ever chosen, although they could have avoided major delays. I assume that the other Garmin products use these Mexico maps so watch out, they are awful."
3,Garmin Nuvi VS TomTom ONE,"I have owned a TomTom ONE, and this Nuvi 250, and I prefer the TomTom, however there are SOME features the Nuvi has which I would prefer. When you get to your destination, the Nuvi tells you it is on the ""Left"", or ""Right"". The TomTom does not, so you are left to wonder which side of the street your address is on at night when it is difficult to see house numbers.. The voice on the Nuvi sounds ""tinny"" as opposed to the TomTom. There are more display items on the screen on the TomTom. I don't need to see my speed, as I have a speedometer to show me my speed. I'd rather have a compass on the main screen instead. IF I were purchasing another, I would definitely get the TomTom. Additionally, the Nuvi announces my next turn in tenths of a mile, which is easier to understand than so many feet as the TomTom announces."
4,Nice GPS!,I lost my power cord and found this unit will not work a similar one or even a usb cable with a usb adapter in the cigarette lighter. I ordered a new one thinking this unit was shot and it works fine again.Love the fact that is has a security code which prevents thieves from knowing where you live if they break into your car. It also asks you if you want to keep the unit on or shut it off when you stop in a rest area. It turns off automatically if you do nothing.Tip: Thieves look for marks on the windshield so I attached his unit to my dashboard with adhesive velcro. It seems to be easier to view as it's usually shadier.
1,Don't buy!,"We purchased this Garmin in the past two years and in this time have replaced the power cord three times. It has broken yet again and need to replace it once more. The suction cup that attachs it to the window has died as well. Don't waste your time on this product, as we have spent enough in replacement items to have bought a new device. I contacted Garmin with my concerns and was essentially ""blown off."""
3,Basic GPS,"It is very good value for money and easy of use , but it does not have many features which more expensive models have( Audio prompts of streets). It does take a while to relocate the address and there was times in which you follow the instructions and it has to recalculate again and again to get you there. But most of the time it does its job. If buying it I would strongly recommend getting the friction pad along with this. The pad which comes with the GPS looses its grip very soon and the permanent pad also comes off soon.I ran into a bit of trouble during delivery , I ordered for the product and checked standard delivery and USPS said that they had delivered the item but I did not get it. But Amazon customer service was excellent and they arranged Fedex delivery with overnight shipping so that I got my GPS. To make sure that I get it I asked Fedex to hold it and picked it up personally."
5,GARMIN NUVI 250 is SUPER!,"I've put off buying a GPS for some time now, but finally purchased this unit/model. It is not only simple ... it is AMAZING and the handiest device you can ever own. Don't buy anything more than this model UNLESS you travel full time for recreation and want to know every site in the world to visit. This model does it all and does it well! Garmin and AMAZON are at the very top of my list!"
5,Garmin,"GPS has worked great ever since I bought it. I have only had it for a bit so I cant say much about it, so far I would highly recommend it."
3,I would expect more from a Garmin product.,This GPS system is good for the price. I had my time comparing GPS devices below the USD$100.00 and I found this one on a 'hot deal' here.Pros:-Small-Good price-Bilingual (English/Spanish)-Loud speaker-Pedestrian modeCons:-Lack of headphones jack-Lack of text-to-speech functionality-Favorites get lost after soft-reset-Soft reset often required after couple of days without use.-It has a lag to obtain satellites so DON'T try to use it unless waiting couple of minutes before it gets signal.
4,Garmin 250,"a lot of people told me Garmin is good GPS so I decide buying it ""Garmin 250"" but it is not exact direction to show me the location where I want to go. I don't know what happen because sometimes it shows ""satellite missing"" and doesn't move in the screen. Maybe other models are better.Product link,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NW0Y9W/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title."
5,The Garmin nuvi 250 Is Fun!,"Being new to the GPS world, I was unsure which brand and model to buy. I am happy with my choice, as it is fun and easy to use. The graphics are wonderful, the ease of inputting information is great, and the versatility suits my needs just fine."
4,Perfect for the prize,"My decision to buy the Nuvi 250 was easy-my parents already had the 200 model and I liked it. The 250 was exactly the same, with a Canada map addition. This product is great in size, very thin, accurate, and user-friendly. The voice doesn't stress me out (some other brands sound like sandpaper). If I had to mention one drawback, it's the fact that it didn't come with a protective case. I keep mine in an oversized makeup bag since the suction cup is an awkward size."
5,Great little gadget,This little GPS will never get you lost. I use it more than I ever expected too. Don't need to read a map anymore with this thing. Highly recommend this to any one that travels or just wants to find a reasturant or any points of interest.
4,Great basic GPS,"This is just perfect for my needs. I primarily use it in and around town versus on trips. I tend to get turned around easily in the downtown area and then end up lost and calling friends for assistance. But this little gem has really helped. No more being lost and frustrated. And I'm much more confident exploring around the area because I know I can't get lost again. The reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is the user interface. It's not as intuitive as it could be. Also, the stuff most users use the most is on the 2nd and 3rd screens versus the main page."
5,great better than our nuvi 350,"THIS UNIT IS VERY EASY TO OPERATE OUR NUVI 350 LASTED ONLY ONE YEAR ABOUT 8 USES AND NOW THE KEY PAD WON,T WORK SO I DECIDED ON A 250 AND IT IS MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GARMIN."
4,Word 2007 Help Cards,Received the order very promptly. The help cards are well done but assistance provided is less than I had anticipated.
1,Garmin nüvi 250 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator (Silver),Did not come with all attachments as metion. Not happy with the product was delivery incomplete
1,"no battery life, tech support are idiots","You can't register it w/o downloading a browser plugin. Said plugin won't install. FAQ says you need new drivers. New drivers don't install. Tech support looks for a familiar word in your complaint and emails a cut and paste response based on that one word.Oh, and the battery is only good for a few minutes."
5,loved it!,"i bought this as a present, and the person loved it :) it's a good size, not too large so it's good for guys with slimmer wrists or who are lankier. it's classy looking, goes with pretty much any kind of outfit and is perfect for a working professional. plus, no batteries so you never have to worry about it replacing them!"
1,How's your eyesight?,"Can't easily see the time! In normal daylight or in any well lit place the face of the watch shines almost as if it were a jewel. Direct light does something to the face, I can't quite describe it other than to say it has an unusual sheen which unfortunately makes seeing the time very difficult. I have good eyesight but unless I'm out of any direct light I have to cover the face of the watch with my hand to block the light and peek in to see the time. The black face with highly polished silver numbers and markings are beautiful, and I'm sure it's a quality watch but if I can't easily tell the time (anytime) I can't rate it above 1 star."
3,"Good, but not great","The watch I bought is a fabulous watch, as I expected, but the seller uses a poor shipping company, and as such after they tried to deliver the first time (obviously during my work hours) I called to set up redelivery... was told to drive across the city and pick it up."
4,"Good watch, strap and dial could be better .....","I like the Eco technology - beats having to change batteries every couple years. This is a wonderful watch, lightweight and accurate.I wish the dial was less shiny and easier to read .... watches should focus on ease of readability, and provide better contrast between digits and dial, including the hour and minute arm. Silver hour and minute arm tends to not be as easily visible. It would also be nice to have a softer leather strap, maybe with wear the strap will do better but seems kind of rigid.All in all, the watch is excellent and a steal for the current price. Amazon is our flagship vendor, has a great balance of good products, service and price."
1,Takes 4 hands to use.,It takes two adult and two child hands to hold them in place and actually drink. Numerous spilled glasses trying to use them. They take too much energy to use that it takes away all the fun. Disappointing! Such a cute concept.
3,fun but awful to clean,"fun in concept but had to toss after 3 uses, really hard to keep clean without constantly arranging tubing to dry"
3,Cool but short lived,"These were fun for a few minutes and served their purpose, however, my grandkids haven't thought of them since Christmas breakfast. LOL!"
3,Glasses,"Used as ""gag"" gift stocking stuffer. They were looked at and the recipient replied....""okay"" and went to the next gift."
5,Great pen,It is a great pen. We had a cross before that had the clip part break off but this one is doing fine so far. It has a good weight and size to it.
3,The gift was not appreciated,"The person I gave this product as a gift never even used it outside of his house, saying it was too ugly and impractical (i.e. thick).I happened to like it, but I wasn't the reason why I bought it, hence the 3 stars."
1,one of the worst pens ever.,"Well, it LOOKS nice in the picture but in reality it is a waste. firstly it fell apart the very first time i picked it up. even the 2 penny pens you get at staples with hold up to being held. secondly, its make of super cheap plastic. Though not as good as the plastic used for those two penny pens.since then i have moved away from cross completely. i have moved to Retro 1951 pens were are not as expensive, not perfect, but still a very good value and unlike this cheap pen they really are made of stainless steel or other metals not cheap plastic."
4,Watch Purchase,"The initial watch I ordered was out of stock and unavailable. Unfortunately, I wasn't notified until after the watch was supposed to have arrived. E-watches helped me order a replacement that was most excellant!"
3,Good Xmas background music,I bought this thinking it was just a regular Bill Miller album. Only after I bought it did I realize it was a Christmas album. I listened to it anyway and it's a good Xmas album for background music at a party or just to listen to while you do something else. I still want to check out his normal stuff but this is a good album to buy if you are looking for something other than the standard Christmas CD.
4,"Excellent sound, kinda dorky design","After reading a great review of these in the Chicago Tribune, I was really interested in getting a pair for my iPod, since ear buds have always bothered me.The good news is that the sound is incredible and I don't get the clogged ear-canal feeling like I used to with the ear buds. I'm finally listening to my iPod again after a year's hiatus.The bad news is the chunky design.In fact, the outer shells of the speaker assembly jut from my ears so much that I can actually see them in my peripheral vision while I'm listening!Also, I think I'd be better off with the black color. Whenever I see myself in a reflection with these big white things sticking out of my ears, all I can think of is Woody Allen pretending to be that robot in ""Sleeper."" A co-worker actually said to me, ""Those are some pretty intense headphones ... oh, but you're married, so that's okay."""
5,Incredible Product,"We've tried taking her out to pee more often, had her tested for every manner of bladder infection, taking synthetic hormones, and also stimulants. Every solution from our vet got us nowhere.This product stopped my dog's spay incontinence problem within weeks."
2,Didn't work for my dog,"I was hoping to be able to write a great review, but unfortunately I am not. The product did not work very well for my particular dog. There was minimal improvement, and we have had to move onto more aggresive treament. My weim did like the product and had no problem taking it, she took it like a treat."
4,Still a great performance,"Long, long ago...before there were a shelf full of recordings of this work, this was the recording that captured my heart. I used to manage a small record store - and I'd give a money back guarantee to anyone buying this recording.It still is a fine performance - still magical but there are others now that are very competitive. While a baroque work, the performance has definite romantic leanings - so not for your authentic music folks."
1,Ugh,"I was hoping this was a recording I once owned on cassette. It wasn't, not even close. Violin out of tune (or poorly played); violin out of sink with orchestra; clearly flubbed notes; overall simply flat production, not dynamic."
1,Disappointed,"The outfit I ordered was ripped and the material was see through looks nothing like the image I was. On vacation and when I finally seen it, it was to late to return. Waste of 40 some bucks."
1,"YOU TOO,CAN DRESS UP LIKE AN UGLY OLD CREEP!","Wow! Who wouldn't wanna wear a robe that an ugly old creep who has helped to steal the innocence of many young women through the years,wears? What a wonderful thing! You too can flaunt around in this old pervert's robe too!"
3,"Interesting, but flawed and dated","I liked this, but the authors cultural, artistic, and political approach was uneven. The idea was to take a broadbrush stroke across Berliner society in the 20's. It failed.First, ""No Maps!"" This is the curse of these histories. I was driven to my ""London Times Atlas"" to find the the Communist stronghold of Wedding. And Prussia constitues how much of the Weimar Republic? (Minus one star.)Second, the bearest hint of what it is like to live a low-middle class life in-between the wars. Why would a ribbon clerk in Spandau vote for the SPD in 1928. I don't know. It is the ordinary people, and not Bernard Brecht, Albert Einstein, Joey Goebbels that put their shoulder to the wheel of history. Naked female stage shows aside. (Minus another star.)In addition, new information from the Osti archives and interviews could up-date this considerably (if any of them are left alive)."
4,Germany's Hollywood,"Otto Friedrich doesn't offer a sustained argument. Rather, as in his book ""City of Nets,"" on Hollywood in the 1940s, the author collects a series of essays on Berlin, hitting the juicy years before the advent of Hitler and all the ghoulish events that follow. It is a decadent period that seems on the surface rather attractive. Rather like the film/story/musical ""Cabaret"", we get a taste here of the sexual revolution that anticipates what came to American 50 years later. You could call it ""Woodstock with brains"", since the Germans had an army of intellectuals and mad artists with real talent to make these years all the more colorful and tragic. Those who escaped enriched America immensely; those who didn't got eaten up in Hitler's meat grinder. I liked this book, and recommend it along with Peter Gay's ""Weimar,"" another look into the glory years before the disasters to come."
2,Disappointing,"Came to this after reading ""Imperial Grunts,"" a much better book. Soft Power has a valid point -- power isn't all from the end of the gun, but it doesn't help much after you acknowledge that. Perhaps I am too Republican. When I read Nye was AS Defense under Clinton, that seemed to explain a lot."
2,Unrealistic premise...,Joseph Nye keeps repeating himself: multilateralism by global American charm attack. That is simply a stupid assumption. And it is untrue of American history in foreign relations. Nye still owes some answers to European scholars of International Relations who criticized his idea. In fact that is no personal multilateral approach...
1,WHATS WITH THE MONO,"I really like Slim Whitman, but why don't they release his re-recorded stereo versions of these hits instead of these old recordings done in the late 50's. I have an LP of Slim done in the early 70's called Slim Whitman's 15th anniversary album on Imperial records. It had all of his hits in STEREO. Where are these recordings now? Most of the recordings on this album are MONO with a dead like sound and very little bass. Does anyone no where to get all his hits he re-recorded in STEREO?Bill a music lover from Mineola NY."
4,Great!,Great Springs! the only problem(Besides some of them being stuck together) was that the container was cracked Before i even opened it.
5,Wide Selection Of Springs,Sooner or later you'll have a tension spring rust out or pop off. This kit provides a few of each spring type so that you'll be able to quickly get up and running again.
2,mostly extention springs,"the picture for this lies. the box comes with 90 % extention springs and theres only a few small compression springs. if you need extention springs, then this box is for you, but if you need compression springs than this isnt for you."
1,LEASH BROKE DOG FELL 200 FT OFF GORGE TRAIL!,"BEWARE.....DO NOT BUY THIS LEASH!!!! PLEASE.This past weekend we were camping at a State Park. We were walking the Upper gorge trail when our 18 month old puppy spotted a chipmunk. We hit the button and the leash snapped at the nylon 1"" above the collar connection. The puppy feel 200 feet straight off the gorge and another 12 feet when he bounced over the lower trail into the river. Amazingly I can say he survived after many rescue efforts and surgery at Cornell.BEWARE OF THIS LEASH. COMPANY HAS NOT EVEN CONTACTED ME!!!!!"
2,What a waste!!,I bought this toy for my 4 year old grandaugher. Since Barbie rides this horse of course a little girl will want her doll to ride the horse. The wings fall off. We must put the wings back on at least a dozen time a day.
2,Does not hold together,"My daughter was thrilled when she received this for her birthday. However, after 2 days of the wings constantly coming off and having to snap them back in over and over we have both had enough of it."
5,A Lot of Fun!,"I'm 11 and I think this is pretty cool! I was happy to find out that the wings flap, and that the legs are poseable. In the 2 months I've owned it I haven't had any trouble. All of the other reviews give it a bad name! Those kids must be super rough on toys. This is a must for all barbie lovers!"
2,No fly horse,"Honestly I bought this horse thinking that there was some way the wings would flit by themselves. After trying for an hour to figure it out (the directions even made it sound like they did) I found out that they don't. You fly it around with you hand and slowly make the wings flit. It worked ok until the first time we let the horse ""rest"" and it fell over (because it's hard to adjust the legs just right to make it stand) and bent one of the wings. There is no way to bend it back. Now that wing doesn't move up and down very well. The saddle it VERY hard to use. I mean really for the huge amount of money this thing costs it should take off and fly by itself. Now I just wish it would fly away."
1,Terrible Toy- buyer beware!!,"This is a piece of junk. The wings do not stay on and the worst is that within hours of buying it the bendable portion of the back leg fell off. It is broken. For the price and the ""name"" on the toy it should be made much better. Buyer beware, you don't want disappointed children."
1,IF YOU CAN - AVOID THIS TOY,My four year old wanted this toy for Christmas. We thought it would be a lot of fun for her plus the pony is just beautiful.It took over 30 minutes trying to take the toy out of the box and I cut my hand on the plastic the toy is pakaged in - VERY sharp!She was so excited when I finally got the toy together - this wore off after about 5 minutes. She got very upset because the wings did not work with out shaking the horse & then they would fall off. The wings are now discarded in a box in her playroom and she does not want us to put them back on - too frustrating.I understand that little girls love Barbie and this truly is a pretty toy. BUT - if you can avoid it - don't waste your money.
2,Save your sanity - or invest in super glue,"I love the movie and other dolls, but save your sanity and don't get this Brietta the Pegasus. The wings won't stay on - invest in super glue. The saddle won't stay put so is constantly moving and the dolls fall off it which cause the wings to fall off.It is a beautiful Pegasus, just not very good for playing with. My daughter gets VERY Frustrated with it. My suggestion is to pass on this toy.Heather B.http://www.marykay.com/hbresser"
3,Don't brush the mane!,"My 6 year old daughter wanted this pegasus so badly and was thrilled when she received it for Christmas. I had read about the wings falling off, so I wasn't surprised when one of them was a constant problem. I didn't want to glue the wings on because then she would only be a pegasus, not a horse as well.Now, my daughter is in tears because she brushed the mane and it has turned into a big purple afro. My daughter is not very rough on toys, but she wanted to brush the hair and you'd think since there was a brush and hair accessories included that the hair was brushable. NOT SO! I've tried to fix the hair but it seems to be permanently frizzed out a la finger in a light socket. I played with Barbies and Barbie horses as a child and never had one whose hair just turned into a rats nest. I'm disappointed and so is my daughter!"
2,Not high quality,"My daughter HAD to have this for Christmas. Now that she has it, she has played with it for about 5 minutes. Unfortunately, the wings do not stay on and the Barbie has a hard time staying on as well. The packaging was well done, unfortunately they hooked my 4 year old who convinced Santa to get it. I would not recommend this toy."
1,Horse needs to be shot,"Wings, that do not flutter or fly, fall off; plastic bell on necklace, attached with a plastic S hook, falls off; saddle falls off.....all for only $30.00. The Mattel Corp. profits by knowingly producing poorly designed crap and fooling children with their slick and misleading advertising."
3,thank u,"thank you people who wrote reviews on how bad this toy is,I was gonna buy it.But now I know its pretty lame.thank ya"
3,Old time info - nothing new,"I like to read books about walking from time to time because it renews my dedication and gives me new incentives. This book was too long, too wordy, too much information. In fact, it seems to be a very OLD book like it might have been written 45 years ago (but it wasn't!). If you want a short book FULL of incentive try WALK YOURSELF THIN by David A. Rives or 10,000 STEPS A DAY to your optimal weight by Greg Isaacs. Both are full of valuable hints, tips & solid reasons why you should be walking each day, seven days a week."
2,Save your $15,"I have very thick curly hair. This iron does not do the job - I had to go over the same section of hair a couple of times. It just does not get hot enough, the plates are small and it feels cheap and flimsy.It might be ok if you aren't going to be straightening your hair all the time."
3,It was good... For a bit.,"I've had this straightener for about 4 months. At first it worked extremely well but after about 2 months it started to become slower at heating up. Now it doesn't work at all. It was good at a time but now I wonder why I bought it. If you're looking for a new straightener, keep looking. This one's cheap and not worth it."
5,CONAIR FLAT IRON,"This is an excellent curling iron. I am black with relaxed hair and before my visit to the hairdresser, people were amazed that my hair looked so straight.Well done Conair"
2,Big and Bulky!,"It's ok, but, like I said, its big and bulky. I'd rather a nice slim straightener.Well, it does do the job...so if you like it, buy it."
3,ok but didn't last long,"I bought this at amazon and i usually braid my hair so i don't straighten much. I used it about 5 times or less and had a long 6month streak of braiding my hair. Then i tried to use it and it heated up and shut off by itself. That was the end of the relaxer. I'd only had it for less than a year and i couldn't find the receipt to do anything about it. It's kinda made me leary bout buying straightners and while i am serching for one now, i think i'll try a different brand. Hopefully, that will last longer."
3,Not so great for kinky hair,"I have very kinky and coarse hair. This is not the tool for it. Will keep searching until I can find something that works. This straightener takes a little of the bend out making my hair easier to comb, but in no way is it presentable hair. I guess it is back to a straightening comb for me."
1,Ouch,I've had this straightener for a few months now and when I close the hinge mechanism and run it through my hair I then have to pry it back open with force. Super annoying. And my hair gets caught up in it all the time. Bad design.
2,Pulls out your hair!,"The flat iron has a flawed design. No matter how you angle the flat iron, it still finds a way to pull you hair out.Because it is not a very expensive model, the ceramic irons are not sealed around the edges, therefore it is very easy to get your hair caught in it when you are trying to straightening your hair.It also shuts off randomly after 5 minutes or so. Make sure to keep an eye on the lights to ensure it stays on while heating up and while straighting."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Over the years, I have been continually disappointed with Conair products, and with this item, I have decided I will never buy one again! This is not a true ceramic iron (a friend schooled me)-- the plates are ""ceramic coated."" So basically it's a regular straightening iron with a layer of cheap ""ceramic"" over the plates. My hair did not achieve the promised ""professional"" results, and went back to wavy in a few hours. Unfortunately, ceramic irons are one of those professional items you have to pay the top $ to get a good product. The same friend suggests either a Solano or Baybliss (quite reasonably priced)."
3,It's ok,Very inexpensive. You get what you pay for. It's not bad. It does the job but it doesn't leave a shine. I feel like my gaur is a little brittle after using it. Next time I'll spend the extra $30 for a better quality one. I'll save this one for a travel one or just to have an extra one on hand.
1,Failed on First Use,"I've used Conair hair dryers for years and have always been happy with them and the features they offer. But I used this once in Germany and even after turning the switch to the correct voltage it blew out the hotel's circuit to my room. Apparently the switch was not working or this is not dual voltage as stated in description. Blew out the second I plugged it in and turned it on, did not even have a chance to heat up. So, in the garbage it went with an apology to the hotel owner. Nice end to the story, though. He sent me to a electronic store to get a Bosch dual voltage flat iron that works great here at home with a EU to US plug adapter."
5,A great product,"I have long, fine hair with a natural wive that turns frizzy after washing. After ages of fighting for a straight look by blow-drying it straight (and never getting the desired result), I finally saw the light and got this straightener. It works great! Fabulous."
4,Not bad at all,It does the job well. my only complaint is that it doesn't open wide enough. If it did I would have given it 5 stars. Otherwise it straightens hair very nicely.
1,Faulty Product,I received this product in a timely fashion and wrapped it for a Christmas gift. My daughter opened it and was thrilled. She used it for less than two weeks before it quit heating up so I will need to purchase her another one--another brand no doubt.
3,Flat iron for travel,"As a dual voltage product for travel it works fine, but the way it was designed make the plates stick to my hair and pulled some out."
1,Don't buy this!,"This item is a piece of junk. It broke after two uses. And if you have any kind of texture in your hair, it has to be put on the max settings, and even then your hair will only be a ball of frizz. Don't buy this product!"
3,Not Bad For The Price,"I don't feel the plates heat up as much as they should, and the teeth on the detachable comb are too widely spaced for thick or curly hair. But the product will likely work well on tresses that are merely wavy or already on the straight side.I do think this is a good buy for the money (very inexpensive), but this particular Conair simply won't make curly hair STRAIGHT . . . only STRAIGHTER. Having said all this, there are other Conairs on the market suited well to curls."
4,Works Well!,"The flat iron is great! Too bad the reason I bought it was for a trip to England and the converter/ multi plug unit a bought didn't. So, Two weeks of vacation without a flat iron. However, I now have a great back-up iron at home."
2,Certainly not a good straightener..,"Curly, Frizzy, Thick haired guys/girls read this!!!I honestly think a majority of those positive comments were from people who have wavy--straight hair.Straightening your hair with this thing is torture and a waste of time!My hair burns really quickly, you can see smoke, and it doesn't even straighten it enough. My hair after 1- 1 and 1/2 hours still remains with great frizz, poof, and it looks really bad if you have semi-straight hair with noticeable curls in random places..The good thing about is that it is a 2 in. You don't have to section your hair out into 20 + pieces or w/e..But its really only good if you have wavy hair..By the way..there are HORRIBLE fumes from this straightener after over 2 years of use..It smells like pancakes and then it smells like smoke...ehh not a good idea."
5,My hair has never looked better,I'm actually surprised by the reviewers that said that their product broke down in one or two months. I've had mine for almost a year and it's operation is still outstanding. Here are the highlights:1) Temperature control is perfect. I have fine but unruly hair so the metal iron I used before singed my hair constantly. The adjuster really works for this product (not just decoration) and I haven't had the problem of burnt hair since.2) This heats up fast. Again with a metal iron it would take 15 minutes to heat up and would consistently cool down making the whole straightening process take an hour. This takes about 3 minutes to heat up and a minute to reheat. I straighten my hair in 15 minutes now.3) Ceramice plates in general are better for your hair. They won't damage it as much and I've found they are more effective also. My hairstyle will stay all day even in high humidity (provided I have an umbrella).Definately worth your money!!!
5,crazy good for the price,"for the past few year have used Bespoke T3's both regular and wet to dry. assumed it was necessary to pay over $100 for a decent flat iron. my hair is very thick with a lot of wave and cowlicks, shoulder length, bangs, choppy cut. i use an argon oil thermal protector. bought this as a back up flat iron for a trip since it has auto shut off. first time out of the box LOVE IT! hair looks better than it has looked in a long time. will choose this one over my T3's even after i return from my travels. at the price it's an absolute steal. oh, if i have any criticism at all it's that the cord is a bit short but not a problem for my needs."
3,just ok -- used for travel,"This was just okay -- i've taken it on my trips to Europe and didn't love it -- if you're used to a high-quality ceramic straightener (Chi, GHD, Sedu brands, etc), this will be tough to get used to. I guess it got me through in a pinch, but it does take forever and is a bit clunky -- i sort of felt like i was using a Playskool toy. In all honesty, if I were to buy something for travel again, i might think about investing in something better for time's sake, and for the sake of my hair, as this seemed to fry it a little. All of that being said, I didn't feel like I had to worry about ruining this straightener due to differences in electricity/voltage from one country to the next, bc it was so cheap -- if it had broken i wouldn't have been devastated, so there's the benefit! Lastly, for travel it's kind of bulky/heavy."
4,Does its job.,"This is a not bad iron. The only thing that is frustrating is that after a few passes, the iron cools, and it needs to reheat itself to achieve optimal straightening."
3,Worked in France,"Not saying it worked REAL well, but when you are used to a CHI, it's hard to use anything else. It did the job well enough while in Paris so I wouldn't have to worry about blowing out my $150+ CHI."
5,Love it!!!!,"I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas. She is 11 and her goal is to get her hair as STRAIGHT as possible!!!! This little gadget does the trick! And...it's pretty, too!"
2,Fried my hair,Forgot my flat iron on vacation. I bought this one but it freakin fried my hair!!!!!! i had to get an inch cut off when I got home.
1,wrong picture - no comb,I purchased this straighter because of the comb attachment (I had an identical one from amazon 2 years ago but I dropped it and it broke) - it is the only kind that works for my very thick hair. When it arrived there was no comb - I will be returning it.
1,NOT THE ITEM PICTURED . . .,"If you are looking for the Conair flat iron with the comb attachment as is shown in the picture - DO NOT PURCHASE it here. You will NOT receive what is pictured. You will get a ""new"" Conair model that DOES NOT have the attachment. I was looking to replace my old iron that finally died after about 4 years and I loved this unit. I looked in all my local stores and could not find the exact replacement so I assumed Conair had updated this model when I checked Amazon.com I was delighted as I thought I would get what was pictured but did not - they shipped the same ""new"" model that I saw in the stores. Therefore I am giving a one star review as they did not ship what was pictured (I have returned what they shipped). If they would have shipped what I wanted I would have given a 5 star as I loved the old model with the comb attachment - :("
5,Best Straightener Out There!,"This is the best straightener on the market. I've tried HAI, but because I have thick hair, it took forever because it only straightened small sections at a time. In addition, HAI's plates were tiny. This is a great straightener for thick and/or coarse hair."
1,What you see is NOT what you get.,This product DOES NOT come with the comb and brush attachment as decribed. I paid for shipping on an item I literally could have bought across the street at Target.
1,Big waste of money!,"I bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually I bought it twice, since I didn't have much choice where I was shopping. Both times it died. The first iron lasted about 6 months, and the second lasted 2 weeks! Just dies, no warning. My girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a Conair! I am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research!"
4,works good for me,"I bought this hair straightener about a year ago for around 30$ and i find that it works great. I have very thick long hair and i never ever pulled my hair with it. Im not sure if people are using it right. I even had friends who use salon ones for 100-200$ and they are pretty impressed on how well it works. also if you want really nice straight hair blow dry it with a large round brush first, even people with expensive ones do that first. also i use it almost every day and i dont have damaged hair."
5,Wow it actually works,"I can't believe it really works. I was kind of skeptical cuz' I have really thick uncontrollable hair. I have tried almost everything, but nothing really worked that nice. The only thing that can really control my frizzy thick curly hair was going to the salon, but that is way too expensive to go everyday...well, until now. I have to admit the top of my hair is still a little frizzy, but for the most part it is awesome. I definately would recommend it esp. for the price it is going for. Its worth it!"
3,Pretty good for pretty straight hair,"I think this straightener is nice. It's not the best, but then again, it's only $12. I bought it because it said it was ceramic. When I opened it, it said ""ceramic technology"" which means the plates are just ceramic coated. It's better than no ceramic at all, but there was a gap in it so I had to squeeze it tightly to actually use it. It also made my hair stick out. My hair is pretty straight naturally, and this made my hair ""emo-like."" It was pretty good, but not the best. Conair makes better, real ceramic straighteners, so I bought a new one and it works much better. The handle was fine, but there was no swivel cord, which is lame. Any straightener that is gold or says ""ceramic technology"" is not very good quality, so save your money and buy a real one."
1,this is the worst,"ok i dont own this product but my mom does nd let me tell u its not even worth the 10 dollars she paid for it1) the ""ceramic"" plates arent even ceramic2)it snags my hair and gives me reeeeeely bad split ends3) it takes forever to heat up4)it doesnt even make my hair straight in the first place"
2,I would give it 1.5 stars...,"At first I had a REVLON hair straightner. It was a piece of crap. After it broke I bought this CONAIR straightner from Wal Mart. Thinking it would be a nice change. After I got it I used it straight away. And it did work pretty well... I mean it straightened my hair and better than my old one. But it still left my hair frizzy.And I've been using it ever since... but I hate it. First of all, all of the people that think this is so great. It damages your hair very bad. I do use hair protectant spray, but still this CONAIR fryed my ends and my hair. The other thing is that after about an hour after I straighten my hair... it starts to get wavy. And this iron does NOTHING about frizz.I just ordered a SOLIA hair straightener from folica.com and it looks amazing. So please please please save your money and your hair, and buy a good hair straightner!"
1,Burnt out after 3 months!,"At first I loved it, it worked great on my thick coarse hair. But, just yesterday I plugged it up and the light was on and averything but there was no heat. I even left it plugged in for an extra hour hoping maybe it would heat up but it never did! Now I have to buy a new straightener and it won't be this one because there was a review similar to mine therefore I know it wasn't just my straightener."
1,This product is crap for kinky thick hair,"I purchased this iron in hopes to be able to nicely straighten my hair after blowdrying. This product is just not good at all. I cannot getas close to the root as I would like. It doesn't straighten well. You'll have to go over a section of hair multiple times to get a somewhat decent result. If I were you, I'd invest money in a good ceramic flat iron like a CHI or Biosilk. Both of those work great."
1,BURNED MY HAIR OFF AND UNIT MELTED,DO NOT BUY THIS FROM ANYONE AT ANYSTORE!!!IT GOT SO HOT IT BURNED MY HAIR INTO NOTHING THAT FELL OUT. I HAD TO GET A HAIRCUT JUST TO EVEN IT ALL OUT. SECONDS AFTER IT BURNED MY HAIR I PUT THE UNIT DOWN ON THE COUNTER TO LOOK AT MY HAIR. WITHIN SECONDS THE UNIT HAD THE CERAMIC PLATES METLING OFF OF THE PLASTIC!!!!HEALTH AND FIRE HAZZARD
1,terrible item.,"If you want to end up with a frizzy look, and get your hair pulled by the flat iron plates, you should buy this item.I wished I have never get this, is a terrible product, doesn't do the work, and damage your hair. you better save your money, than buy this crappy product."
2,Super damaging,"I bought this straightener because it was on sale at Wal-Mart. When I first got it it made my hair look gorgeous, but it gave my hair that burnt smell. It heats up really fast, and gets really, really hot, but my hair is more frizzy now than it was before I used this straightener. It gave me split ends like crazy. Also, if you grab too much hair at once, it will snag in the area below the co called ""ceramic"" plates, thus causing more damage."
5,Awesome!,"This straightener is the best! I've tried other ConAir flat irons, but this one is the easiest to use. The 2"" plates allow you to put a decent amount a hair through and the little plastic teeth help to keep them in place (not to mention you aren't constantly brushing your hair!) I have thick, long, wavy hair and with this straightener I'm done in 15 minutes! With other flat irons my hair falls out of the plates and I have to go over the same spot over and over again. The cool-touch tips are great too, I don't think I've ever burned myself. I love this one so much, it's my second time buying it. The first lasted about two years, after that it'll take a little longer to heat up and the heat doesn't stay as consistent. Well worth the price for me. I can't imagine using any other straightener. I strongly recommend it to anyone!"
5,Best straightener ever....and cheap!!!,"I've owned several different straighteners in the past, but I must say this is the best one I've used to date. It heats up quickly and won't scorch your hair. It actually left my hair very shiny afterwards. Also, at $20, it's a steal!"
4,"great, but big","I bought this straightener based on the reviews that said it worked great, and it does. But it is fairly heavy and too big for my medium length hair. I had previously had a flat iron that did nothing in comparison, and this worked great. I bought a lighter more expensive one, and I would say that this one still does a better job, though I like have a smaller one for me in particular."
2,Great At First then Dies,I loved this straightener when I first got it. I thought it was amazing. It lasted for about 5 months and the plates just stopped getting hot. My friend had the straightener and the same thing happened to her.
2,3 months of joy,"This product works really well even on my thick and curly hair, I was pleasantly suprised... until this week it BROKE. It just stopped heating up while I was using it :(. Now I have to get a new one, this iron is not worth the stress of replacing it every 3 months. Get something a little more expensive and durable"
5,Better than CHI,"I LOVE this iron. I have been using the same one since 2003!!! Daily!! I personally think this does a better job than a CHI. I like that it has wide plates and it glides right through my hair, makes it super shiny. Love the handles, easy to grasp and manuver through my hair quickly. People will say it's not as good because the plates are only ceramic plated. It has not damamged my hair at all and it has a wide range of heat settings to accomodate anyone. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
5,I love this straightener,I have had 2 of these straighteners and I am about to purchase my 3rd one! It is the only straightener that hasn't damaged my hair and could keep my hair straight all day! I honestly don't know what I would do with out my straightener! I have used this straightener for 6 years and I have NO intentions of ever changing! I did once and I learned my lesson!
1,Absolutely horrible - tears your hair out,"I've used several straightening irons before, and this is the worst one ever. Conair makes good straightening irons sometimes, and that's what makes me so angry about the quality of this one--they know better. You can't do a single swipe of the iron without it snagging some of the hair in the border around the heated iron section. What good is straight hair if you have zillions of flyaways? Time for a new brand of straightening iron."
2,Caches and Breaks Hair,We bought this flat iron because it is dual voltage and we need that for traveling. That part is fine. The problem is that the hinge of the flat iron is close to where you pull your hair through the flat iron. This causes it to catch and then break hair as you are trying to pull your hair flat. Not great if you regularly flat iron your hair.
1,This is not the item you will receive.,"I need a flat iron that has a built in comb, because I have such thick hair. I was excited to find this item online, so excited that I ordered TWO. The item I thought I was buying is not the item that showed up. It's a completely different model, color, size, and it does not come with an attached comb. So if you like the thrill of spending hard earned money on a product, and then getting something ""kinda similar"", then this product is for you. Buyer beware."
2,works great but too big,"I purchased this item because of the good reviews and the bargain price. It heats up fast and works as advertised. But it's quite tough to straighten hair of medium length, especially around ear, because the plate size is too thick."
4,Good for the price,"I got this as a gift for Christmas and love it! I have used other $40-$50 ones and yes, they work a little better but not much. Save your money and buy this. It is amazing. Also, considering the fact that all together there are only 5 reviews under 3 stars. That is a good sign. I love this and IF it ever breaks I will buy another in a heartbeat!"
2,hmm.. not too good.,"ok so my dad bought me this striaghtner a year and a half ago.at first i was happy with it becasue my hair was striaght, but tehn this strong oder started comming from it and my room started to havve a buringin smell to it every time i turned it on.my hair gets caught in frequently and it doesnt always stay on the highest power, even though it says it is, the heat isnt as strong.also my hair doesnt stay striaght for more then 1 hour after straighting it.maybe its just the one that i own, but i am not really satisified with this product and if you are looking at it, i recomend spending a little more money to buy a way better quality one that wil actually work. trust me, its worth the few extra dollars."
4,I love it!!,This is so cool! i ordered it sep.15 and i got it the next day.I love how it has big plates and how it heats up in 60 sec.It really is worth buying!
1,Not so good.,"I bought this because the reviews were so great. However, I dont like this iron. It takes soo long to do my hair. it's too big, and its hard to get your hair in it."
3,Straightens Hair... sort of,I have thin wavy hair and I have to keep this straightener on the highest setting just to see results. I bought it because it was a good price but I wish I would have spent more money on a better quality straightener.
2,Doesn't get hot enough,"I bought this iron for a trip overseas since my usual flat iron (Remington Wet2Straight) isn't dual voltage and I burned one out the last time I tried to use it in Europe with a transformer. I'm South Asian with very thick, coarse, curly hair and this iron just didn't get hot enough to fully straighten it out. It took over an hour to get through a first pass of my (completely dry) hair and the results were not satisfactory given the time invested. It got my hair straight-ish but there were still crimps and it just generally wasn't as sleek as I normally get it with the Remington. If I tucked my hair behind my ear there would almost immediately be a sharp bend that I'd have to iron out again. All in all, this is probably fine for the average person but it just isn't up to the job for extra stubborn curls. If you have coarse or thick hair I would look elsewhere."
2,It's just ok,Not so great for course curly hair. I needed to repeat working on the same hair part repeatedly.the good part was that it heats up in no time.
3,It's OK but not great,It heats up fast and gets very hot. However it doesnt look anything like the picture. The handle is one of those V shaped handles that is open at the end ---< and I cant seem to hold it all the way open to grab my hair. I find it difficult to get any amount of hair in it. Once I get a little bit of hair in it It snags my hair in the hinge and rips it out. Also when Im dragging it down my hair I cant go all the way down without it ripping my hair out.
1,Stopped heating up after 3 months,"Mine was fine the first week or so I had it. I use it an average of 2 times per week. By the second week (about 4 uses) it stopped heating up as much. It was enough to get my hair somewhat straight, but not enough. I called the company and asked what I can do about it since my 90 days is up at the store. They told me to package it, pay to ship it back, AND write them a check for them to ship me a new one. That was going to cost more than buying a new one. Their response was that I had no other options. I told them my option would be to buy another brand. I have seen more than one review saying this happens. Do they not see a problem here?"
1,Conair set a new marker for what Low Quality really is,"This this is AWFUL! my hair is completly fried, and after 2 weeks it doesnt even straighten anymore.Dont waist your money"
2,Cheaply Made,"I've purchased two Conair Instant Heat Ceramic Hair Straighteners and even recommended it to a friend and all have provided similar results. If you live in a humid area, your hair will not remain straight the entire day.... not even the entire morning. Walking out your front door will cause instant waves, just be warned. Also it is not a lasting product. After a couple of months, all three products broke in the handle area and, in the majority of cases, exposed the inner wires. While temporary results are great, if you're interested in lasting, repeated performances... try another product."
5,LOVE IT....LOVE IT.....LOVE IT.......,"I have very curly hair, which I love to wear straight, after trying to straighten my hair once with another more expensive hair straightener and ending up with a scarecrow mop I gave up and just went to my hairdressers to get it blown out. Decided to give it one more try myself after reading the reviews on this Conair, after all it was only $20.00. WOW I loved it, my hair looks awesome, this is a great buy."
2,hmmm....,"I've had this for a while now but reading the other reviews made me wonder about mine although mine which still works perfectly fine but I found that this iron was heavy and difficult to use during hot weather. I always had to go over one spot repeatedly in order for it to stay straight and whenever I try to protect my hair from the heat my hair would come out looking very stringy.I'm 16 with relaxed (permed) hair and whenever I have new growth I try to stay away from the salon for a two weeks by straightening my hair but the iron never got close enough to my roots to make it look totally straight so I would suggest that anyone looking to invest in a straightener should look for one that's less ""clunky."" I've looked into the the Andis Ceremic flat iron and I have yet to use it but it looks promising."
4,Conair Hair Straightener,I was very surprised at how well this product worked for me. My hair is very curly and it would normally take me around 2 hours to straighten because I would have to blow dry it straight then use a straightener. Even after I had worked on it for hours it wouldn't be completely straight and any contact with humidity would cause it to frizz up.I was so happy when I bought the conair straightener because it made the work so much easier. I was really happy with the size of it. It made the process much faster. Like for example today I woke up and my hair was completely curly. I was able to completely straighten it in a hour. And I got caught in a drizzle and my hair didn't frizz. I was really happy with my purchase.
5,Very Good,This iron gets very hot fast. I have thick and wavy hair and it only takes me about 20 minutes to get my hair very straight. It is also very comfortable and easy to hold. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Good product,I bought this because I need a dual voltage straightener to take to Eurpoe. It works really well and does a good job straightening my frizzy hair.
2,Not a great straightener BUT works well abroad,"I am not a big fan of this straightener (my multiple Remington straighteners are much more efficient for comparable price), however it is my go to when traveling abroad since it has the dual voltage function. It is one of few flat irons which has this capability, and it's cheap, making it perfect for international travel. It does not get super hot as I am used to(my others go up to 410 and I use the 390 setting) and I found it hard to get my hair as straight as I like. There is also no locking mechanism, which would have given it one more star.Overall, good for international travel. Would not recommend for daily use, or for use on thick, curly hair."
5,Worth every penny,"I wish I would have bought one of these a couple years back when I started growing out my hair. And to think it is pretty cheap too. Wow.My hair looks great now! I feel a lot more confident about myself and more happy with my hair. Doesn't get rid of all the frizz but that's what frizz lotion is for, right?This is really easy to use...the comb pick works wonders, while I wasn't too impressed with the bristle pick.Still, my hair has never looked this good and I owe it all to this gizmo. If you have long, wavey and/or unmanageable hair, pick up one of these today."
2,Good if you don't want to spend a lot of money,"I've had this iron for a while, and it can get your hair reasonably straight. I have thick wavy hair and this at least tames it down a bit, but you can't get all the wave out. It also doesn't help at all with the frizz. If my hair has dried a certain way its nearly impossible to get it to do anything different except straighten it a bit. So if you want real straight, smooth hair don't buy this. I used my friends hot tools iron and it works great, I might be getting one of those."
1,not suitable for longer hair,"This straightener will probably do a really good job on shorter hair, but it does not get hot enough to make my hair silky smooth and dead straight. Granted, it was less than 20 bucks.I suggest this straightener for short hair, but my hair is extremely long and wavy, and this straightener didn't grant me the smooth, thin texture I desired. If you invest in some good styling products, however, it might work for you.I am now buying a Hot Tools one, that brand works well and the products are less expensive than HAI or CHI straighteners."
4,No qualms,"So far I have had the straightener for about two weeks, it heats up fast, to a high heat if needed. I haven't had any problems with this device. I would recommend this item though if you were in the market of looking for an affordable flat iron that gave you the same quality straightening power of a hot tools, now it doesn't get that hot, but it's pretty darn close. I have very thick hair and it takes me less then a half hour now to straighten it all.I gave it four stars just because I wasn't blown away by the product, now if it was a singing straightener maybe we'd be on to something. just kidding.But really this is a good product, I highly recommend it"
3,Good Product,"I like this product pretty well. It does a great job of straightening and often my sisters will steal it from me because they like it so much. The only problem I have with it is it's size. Even though I have longer hair, the straightener is almost too big to effectively straighten my hair. I will often have to go over the same section of hair again. Also, I have had trouble with my hair getting caught in some of the grooves. But, even though it has some problems, it still does a pretty good job when you get accustomed to working around its problems."
5,A Happy Fifteen Year Old,"The fifteen year old girl to whom I gave the Conair straightener has hair that reaches her lower back, and it curls tightly. She has yearned for years for a straightener that would not damage her hair and allow her to wear it in styles hitherto impossible. The ceramic straightener did all that and more. It was easy to use and has made her very happy. (The styles the hair straightener has made possible also make her appear more mature.) It was her favorite Christmas gift."
1,A Disappointment,"Keep in mind that this straightener is only ceramic coated and pales in comparison to actual ceramic straighteners. I bought this for the low price but with that came the lightweight cheap feel and the horrible results. The plates gripped my hair very roughly instead of smoothly gliding over it. I would not recommend this straightener at all. Don't waste your time or money with this -- I have already returned it to Amazon and received a refund, which I used on the Revlon Satin Finish Ceramic Straightener. I highly recommend that one instead of this Conair piece of uselessness. It costs about $8 more but it's definitely well worth it."
4,It was okay.,"I like this straigtener and all, but it doesn't really ""straigten"" my hair. It looks sleeker, and my hair kind of curls in when I use, but not completely straight. It heats up really fast. Which is a good thing sort of, but I really wanted straight hair. It makes your hair look neater. It looks good after I use it, plus it lasts until you take a shower. Over all its good/okay."
1,BURNT hair!!,I've had several Conair flat irons over the years. They last about a year and eventually give out so I buy another. It's cheap so didn't bother me all that much. The last one I had however malfunctioned in a very bad way. The heating element got so hot is actually singed my hair right off! Since I've had several of these and know how my hair reacts to different settings this is certainly not user error where the setting was too high. How hot does it have to get to actually singe hair off?! Horrible!After months of trying to recondition my poor hair that didn't have to be cut off it's worth the expense of a better quality iron to never have this happen again. Off to better brands which do not include anything made by Conair...
1,Worst Ever,"I recieved this flat iron for a gift a couple of days ago, and it has been the worst gift ever.I have curly, dry, and relativly thin hair and this iron does almost nothing to it, even when turned to full power.It took forever to heat up, and after every two swipes of literaly strands of hair (which is the only way I could get it to work) I had to wait for it to heat up again!It takes literaly hours to straighten my hair with this! I'm so glad I didn't shell out any money for this, as it is quite literaly the WORST flat iron ever."
3,Ok for the price,"As I am looking for a new straightener I was surprised to find my current one in the top 5 bestselling. I had read all the reviews and did not want to spend the money on an expensive straightener and settled for this one. I used it a few times and it did the job okay for the price - my hair was relatively straight, although frizzy. However the handle is quite awkward and it didn't seem to get very hot. I began using my roommate's Chi and was VERY impressed. I used her straightener all of the time and now that we are no longer roommates I think I am going to jump on the bandwagon and spend the money to get a good solid flat iron. I haven't had any problems with this straightener (used it maybe 5 times??) but I just found one that is much better."
5,Great little hair straightener,"My wife bought this from Amazon. She's very happy with it. It works on all kinds of voltages, so you can take it around the world. Sturdy, good quality item."
3,Okay...,"I bought this iron about a year ago, and its not that bad and not that good. I agree with most comments, but the one thing I really noticed was that it doesn't work that well when you really want your hair straight straight. It does the job to keep it straight for a few hours, and sometimes I have to go over my hair 2-3 times just to keep it straight. And...I have naturally straight hair. Its also the size - 3/4 - which is a bit small and annoying so it takes longer to straighten hair. If I had read reviews first about this, I would have considered another one - even if it cost more."
1,TERRIBLE straightener,This is a horrible straightener! It is very bulky and very easy to hit the on/off settings when using the straightener. It is way too bulky to use.
5,Great Little Straightening Iron,"This is the first straightening iron I ever bought, and I've had it for over five years. It works really well. It adds shine to my hair and straightens it nicely. I can't get the pencil straight look that my hairstylist gets, but it gets rid of the frizz and adds shine to my color-damaged hair. As my hair grew longer, I bought a bigger straightening iron that was a total waste of money. I used it a few times on a few different settings, but it didn't give me the results it said it would. So, I went back to my trusted little Conair. I have a good feeling that I'll keep this little thing until it dies."
3,not great,"I liked this product for about a year, then it started to get frizzy, now it's worse. I 've only had this for about a year and a half and it's already dead!!! Not so great. I wouldn't reccomend it."
2,ehhhh.,"I got this product about two years ago and i've had some trouble with it. while it does to a decent job at straightening it would take at least twenty minutes for me to get my slightly wavy shoulder length hair straight. it pulls at your hair and takes about a minute to heat up. after about a year it started turning off randomly while i was straightening. i also recommend using a TON of product, because if you don't, your hair will be wavy again in an hour. i just purchused the herstyler for $50 on amazon and i recommed that one!"
2,A let down!*,I bought this item for my mother in law at christmas and she loved it. she said it was great. So i thought i would try it because im so tired of the little straightners that i have straighten like 5 times to even get it straght. I have really thick hair so i thought this iron would be good. turns out i was wrong. Now dont get me wrong it worked when i did really thin strands of hair and very little at a time. I thought this iron would be different. I feel like i have wasted my money. And when the comb is on it literally pulls at least five pieces of hair out at one time. Maybe its just my hair but i think that was a waste of money. Good luck to whoever buys it.
2,not so good,"Purchased for my wife to use on a trip. She won't use it. The squeeze handles are flexible and don't allow her to put enough pressure on her hair, they just bend instead. Found a Revlon dual voltage from another supplier that works great."
2,not good,This flat iron just splits my hair and pulls it. I use my flat iron daily and couldn't take using this item anymore. I trashed it and bought a Remington for only a little more but that works 100x better.
4,Does it's job,"The product itself does exactly what it's designed to do. The heat settings are nice, though I find myself accidentally turning it up while straightening my hair because of the placement of the dial. I have very straight hair as it is, but I wanted something that would smooth it out after blow drying, and this does a great job. If I were to purchase again I would get the 1"" [or whatever the smaller one is] size because this is a bit too big for my shoulder length hair. I may find it more useful once my hair gets longer again.Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone that has a decent amount of hair and it seems like it would work for all hair types with how high you can get the heat."
5,I love it,"My hair is so curly, i tried so many things to straighten my hair, i came across this ion and i m so amazed. Fast heating and my hair is straight and smooth it looks so healthy. Everytime i wanna straighten my hair i just use a heat protector spray to keep my hair healty. Its the money worth. Price is great the product is great."
5,Great transaction!!!,I bought this product for my daughters!!! What a great article!!! Before this Ceramic Hair Straightened they where using a hair dryer and it was to noisy and it consume so much more WATS!! The Heat Ceramic Hair Straightened is quieter and faster also their hair are very straight and they look prettier!!
3,Amazingly Broken,"I got this straightener a year and a month ago and it was amazing! Before it broke of course. I got it two Christmases ago and it worked GREAT from the moment I used it. My hair stayed straight and perfect through the whole day and it took a few minutes to heat up, but not a half hour like my old straightener thankfully! One morning when I was using it the handle suddenly snapped. It wasn't like I was playing baseball with this thing, just straightening my hair. That was okay, I just used an oven mitt to hold it down on my hair. Now, about a month or two later, it won't heat up at all. It was nice while it lasted. I'll go out and buy something that hopefully last longer."
3,It's Okay,"I've owned this straightner for about 2 years, and it works okay but I have to spend like an hour to get it perfect and it doesn't last all day like I would like. I have medium lenth wavy/curly/straight hair and although it makes your hair super smooth and shiny, I don't think that I would reccomend it for those who don't have a long time in the morning to make it perfect, but it is an okay straightner. I bought an Andis straightner today that I am hoping works better."
1,"Pulls hair, returning","Bought this because of the high reviews here on Amazon, but it pulls my hair so I am sending it back. Disappointed!!"
2,Not great - try the Conair CS25 instead,"I purchased this to replace my Conair CS25 model that I left in a hotel room by accident, and was very disappointed. Although this model does have a comb on the side of it, it did not glide through my hair well - my hair got caught and seemed to stick to the plates. In fact, I pulled out quite a few hairs trying to use it and I felt like it was really damaging. It is also heavy and awkward compared to the CS25 model, harder to manuever to the root of your hair and easier to burn yourself. I stuck it in a drawer after two uses and ordered the other model.The CS25 is the ultra slim model with 1 5/8 inch plates. I'm not sure how it would work on thick curly hair, but for wavy hair like mine that has a little frizz and mostly needs to be smoothed it was fantastic."
4,Looks good so far,I havent used it yet but it looks exactly like the picture....should not be the best but not the worst either! You get what you pay for!
1,Terrible,"Painfully pulls on my hair, doesn't get hot enough, cheap plastic. Everything about this flat iron is a failure. Do not buy it."
3,"Good enough for the price, but not the right tool for every job","This little straightener works well for short or medium length, moderately wavy or frizzy hair. I've owned several of them, and my only complaint is that they simply stop working after 6 to 9 months. For the price, though, this seems like an ok trade-off since I don't need a heavy-duty straightener.I don't understand why ladies with really long, thick, curly hair are on here complaining that this straightener doesn't work for them. If you have major straightening needs, why did you buy the smallest, cheapest straightener available and then get annoyed that it doesn't work for you? This is a TOOL, think like a guy and get yourself the right tool for the job."
3,Good until...,"Well, it was great while it lasted! I have moderately wavy hair and it did the trick...even on the most humid days (and I live in hot/humid NC). I bought this 11 months ago and today, it died. I have an older 1 1/2 inch conair that still works, but I've been using this 2 inch one almost every day since I bought it. I'm disappointed that it lasted less than a year. I expected more than that from Conair."
5,Love it.,Worth the money and has lasted. I love this iron use it everyday and still works wonderfully.
5,GREAT,"This straightener is awesome! I have very fine but frizzy hair. This straightens it in no time, plus NO DAMAGE!"
5,works great,works great on my medium heavy hair..smooth n straightens like a pro..great for the m oney
4,"Perfectly fine, if you're patient.","I've used this straightener for a little over a year now, and I have to say that, although it's not perfect, it does its job. Basically, I have the type of Asian hair that's ""straight,"" but actually kind of thick and wavy. The straightener gets hot enough to make my hair actually stick straight (definitely way more than 68 degrees: it's hot enough that my fingers hurt if I touch my hair afterward, not to mention that 68F is below room temperature anyway...) and I've also been able to curl all of my hair with this tiny straightener. It does tend to tug at hair (it boasts this as a ""feature"" but it's not fun) but it's cheap and it works. Maybe it works a little more slowly than more expensive ones, but it really isn't bad at all."
2,Good backup straightener,I bought this straightener because my expensive one broke after a couple years of using it a lot. It has served as a good backup while i do some research and order a new one but I would not recommend this product as a primary hair straightener. It does not get nearly as hot as the expensive one nor does it hold the straightness for very long.
3,^_^ I like it,"I like this product and the best thing about it is, it actually generates less heat and create a less damage to my hair"
3,OK,"I had brought it for a cousin in India, and probably due to the diff in voltage out there, I didnt find it as good as I expected it to be. It is just an average product and the straightened hair does not last long."
1,A definite bad buy,"I bought this product two weeks ago in a pinch (my old flat iron was destroyed after being used as a chew toy), and it has stopped functioning altogether. The ""Power"" and ""Turbo"" lights will illuminate with no problem, but the plates don't heat up. I'm assuming I was unfortunate enough to get my hands on a defective model, but buyer beware: Sometimes $20 for a flat iron is just too good to be true."
3,It's ok,"I loved it at the first, it straightens my hair, however it doesn't give you the shining smoothy look, it makes my hair very dry. I went to salon, their straightener is much better, it really straightens my hair, and my hair feel so smooth and shining. I am going to get another kind."
3,"Does the trick, but the iron itself is a bit bulky.","Pros: It heats up quickly and has so many setting levels. It tames the frizz in my slightly wavy hair. The one con I have is that it is a bit hard to handle and bulky. I wish there was a smaller version of this iron, like a 1/2 to 1 inch wide plate."
4,Using the product In India,This product works really well. I bought this from amazon when I was visiting USA. I was scared if it will work in India. Biut all it took was a plug point converter and It works just fine :-)
2,"Like Louise Hay, but not in words but in pictures....","See what you want in front of you, imagine what it would be like and if you do that as much as you can things will come your way and you can change your life! So now you don't have to buy the book."
5,try to imagine,"As well as this cd has stood the test of time, try to imagine: A very young, unknown Chicago guitarist, releasing a non-jazz, (and really not quite any other style music known up to that point),all-instrumental album ,in the late 60's, with an entirely new guitar sound. Astounding..one the major breakhoughs in modern guitar.///(6/3/2006, afterthought): ///As a rock/blues/experimental, mainly instrumental artist , Mandel's been in the shadow of Jeff Beck's greater renown. With that in mind, I ask you to listen to this '60s recording,(and his others of this period), and compare them to much of the very recent work by Jeff Beck. It's beginning to look more and more as though Mandel was the one truly ahead of his time.///"
4,Bought this for one song,"I bought this for Cristo Redentor alone, and it was well worth it for that one song. I owned this album on vinyl when it was first released and always loved this song. Worth every penny to have this version, but the rest of the album is fairly lackluster in my estimation as a musician and recording engineer for over 20 years. Just not material that stands the test of time -- for me."
5,Hiking Acadia National Park,It was easy to use. You didn't have to read the whole book to find what you're looking for. I especially liked how the hikes were categorized.
5,Great guide,"This is a great guide to hiking Acadia. It is well thought out with useful information on the elevation, skill level and views. The maps that show the trailhead could be a little clearer, but I didn't struggle too much. I bought a few books on the park and this is the one that I relied on the most."
4,"Good music is good, my review has a title.","If you like Social Distortion, you'll like their greatest hits. If you're unfamiliar with Social Distortion, their songs have a good beat(uptempo w/beats on 2 and 4), with simple, but well done rock guitar, and the lead singer has a cool gritty voice. I guess you could say it's punk rock, but I'm not familiar with all the million and three quarters stylistic labels that are out there these days and I'm sure someone will disagree.I really like songs 2-7 (Mommy's Little Monster, Story of My Life, Ball & Chain, Ring of Fire, etc.) The songs near the end are good too, but a little similar, which is only a problem if you're more of a casual fan."
4,Best for the die-hard or the new new Social D fan,"I didn't want to buy this, but I knew I would. I have every other album and Mike's solo work as well. I never miss a chance to them in concert whenever they are within 100 miles (and sometimes farther).I also have this theory that once a band releases a ""Greatest Hits"" collection they are essentially done making anymore good music. I'm hoping that Social D is the exception.The classics are here and they sound okay, but once you compare them with the original versions (so easy to do when it's all in your iTunes) you'll find that these re-recorded versions lack the depth and feeling of the originals."
3,"Great music, some songs missing, strange cover art","Social Distortion is a fantastic group of musicians that have fused punk and country to make their own, original sound. This compilation contains several of their greatest hits, including ""Reach for the Sky"", a piece so transcendent I plan on having it played at my funeral.The only complaints I have are twofold: One, that several great songs of theirs were left off the album. Where are ""Broke Down in Bakersfield"" and ""Nickles and Dimes"", two songs that deserved to be included?The second is that the cover art on the album is just wierd, consisting of a masked man with a gun. What does that have to do with their music? Who chose that image?This is a worthy effort that will please Social D fans, but it could have been better."
1,Save your Nickels and Dimes,"I bought this on impulse. I love the band, and see them live whenever they're within 300 miles from home.There aren't any original studio recordings on the disc. Nothing you've ever heard on the radio, nothing you've seen live. It's a quickly thrown-together garage-studio set of re-interpreted hits, and a few non-hits mixed in. There are some obvious choices missing, as well, but I knew that when I bought it.Some tracks have cinder-block-room reverb. Others have mic splatter. It's just a hard disc to listen to. It doesn't sound live *or* studio. It sounds like a demo tape, really, but without the energy.If you want live recordings, get the live cd they put out a few years ago. If you want the cleaned-up originals, get the old sony cds (or better yet, just download them for free from the Social D web site). If you've already got both, just save up your nickels and dimes for the next show."
5,For fans of great rock n roll (not just punkers),"Many people categorize Social Distortion as ""punk"" due to Mike Ness' unique voice and the heavy use of crunchy guitar and feedback. Forget about labels, Social Distortion is one of America's last great rock bands. Influences include country, rockabilly and of course punk. A few listens to these songs will motivate you to go out and purchase their previous CDs (perhaps even Mike's solo efforts).There are a few complaints here about re-recording the original songs for this CD. Its not a big issue - the songs are all great regardless of when they were recorded. Pick up this CD and your ears will love you for it."
1,Very Disappointed,"The doll is beautiful to look at and the eye catcher is when she glows but overall she is a waste of money. Her clothes are not user friendly although they just snap on and if I can't get them to stay then you can only imagine my 6 year old grand daughter trying to get them to stay on. The wings won't stay on and the calf coverings keep falling off.For the price, I am very upset about the whole ordeal. And it upsets me more to hear the disappointment in my grand daughters voice. I will never buy another Fairytopia doll."
1,Bad,Im mad only after 2 days my barbie hand broke!I hate her! I only like fairytopia mermaid she no brake.
2,CHILL OUT PARENTS AND KIDS!!!,"Wow, I am amazed at parents and kids responses. This doll is very pretty and my daughter could care less about the clothes. The fact that it lights up is cool. The kids that are freaking out are SPOILED ROTTEN and it sounds like the parents are making them this way because they are making such a big deal out of everything!"
2,BAD HAIR DAY,"i hate her hair. It sucks!!!!!! That's the most ANNOYING thing that's ever happened!!!!!! Of all my Fairytopia dolls, Crystal has the WORST hair EVER!!! SUCKS!!!!"
2,Absolutely Frustrating!,"My 3 1/2 year old HAD to have this doll and does enjoy it somewhat. But she is so often frustrated by the wings falling off, skirt falling off and the shoes(?) that NEVER stay on. And I'm constantly frustrated by having to help her put the clothes on. This might be a Barbie for an older girl who can manage the clothes herself, but I even have a time getting them on and getting them to stay! Also, the hair feels rather greasy. My daughter likes that the doll glows - but it just looks weird to me."
3,Pretty but clothing poorly designed.,"Hi - I agree with an earlier review, the doll is very pretty, and my daughter loves how it lights up, but the clothing that comes with her does not stay on well. One of the ""bras"", that is a hard plastic and is supposed to snap on, snapped in 1/2 when trying to get it on the doll! My daughter ended up ditching the wings and outfits, and put a gown on her!"
3,"Beautiful doll, frustrating accesories","THis doll is beautiful. I love the decorative ideas they put into this doll.. I got mine on clearece so I am not that disappointed. If I paid more I may be more upset.BUT the ""skirts"" and wings do not stay on well at all. ESPECIALLY Skirt. :(. the skirt is something I think most young kids would not be able to put on themselves.My daughter still enjoys playing with her so it is not a total waste. I am planning on gueing the wings into place. the first time I have ever glued a toy. I really do not see why the wings have to be detachable :). I like the idea another posted about using hair elastics to keep the skirt on.Personally I like the idea of buying more uniquely barbies. I can see Fairytopia barbies becoming our favorite ones inthis house!"
5,Original masterpiece,"This was a great book which dealt with homelessness, and the community's reaction to a homeless woman. The opening scene in this book was surprising, and the book continues that way until its resolution. There are no sympathy games played in this novel, but you can't help but loving each one of its characters."
4,Good first rangefinder,"I bought this product for the hunting mode calculation for angles, etc., and it has a nice feature to change from feet to yards. I wish the unit was a little smaller because it's rather large, and I wish there was a backlight for low-light conditions. Other than those minor feedback items I'm very happy with it."
3,The 80/20 Individual,This book was good but I enjoyed the previous book The 80/20 Principle more. My reason for that is that much of what was covered in the 80/20 Individual was just a regurgitation of the 80/20 Principle.
1,"Waste of Time, get his other book The 80/20 Principle","This book was a complete waste of time. I'm glad that I got it from the library before making the mistake of buying it. I suggest you do the same.With that said, Koch's first book The 80/20 Principle is definitely worth reading. Just a little warning, his first book is filled with a LOT of information. Read the first section and ONLY the remaining sections that pertain to you (ironically that is his advice for other books). I read the section for individuals, and was able to immediately apply some of the information to better my life."
1,An empty-hearted effort,"Managing personal efficiency is no doubt an important skill. And judging from the author's success from the first book, I assume he is a credible author. But this book is just way too shallow and lacks the evidence of any sinerity for the readers. If you are new to the concept of life efficiency management, it might be good to read his first book. If you are looking for a good framework or advice on how to achieve your goal, then you will for sure be disappointed. This whole book is just about stressing the importance of efficiency management. Absolutely anything else!"
4,Interesting Follow Up to the 80/20 Principle,If you enjoyed the 80/20 Principle this is a good guide to applying it in your life. He does make some bold predictions like highly competent individuals will soon make public corporations obsolete. Some of this book is highly speculative and other parts are very practical. Luckily it is pretty easy to tell which is which. Very interesting book.
2,Kinda Grandma,The photo makes this product look great! But when I got it I was suprised how much orange and pink there was...
3,"Leading, worth reading, Butler's succeeding","A novel of the life of Edward VII, it is nicely written in that it takes your attention and makes you continue. I found it interesting, though i don't know how much is novelisation and how much is fact, as i know little about Edward (Prince of Wales in this; Volume II sees him as King), and cannot judge accuracy. I suppose the best compliment i can pay is that i now want to find a true biography of Edward and read that."
5,awesome,movies was delivered fast.loved how it teaches children so much.my daughter loves it.thank you very much really loved the movie for my daughter
3,didn't keep her attention long,"My 2 1/2 year old loves Diego, but for some reason this one didn't keep her attention long. but overall it wasn't bad"
4,As always the kids love Diego,"The kids love Diego.Keeps the entertained in the car, or when I am cooking dinner.Diego is for older kids compared to Dora., I find."
1,Healing the South,"The south ought to face up to their misdeeds instead of constantly trying to jusify their shortcomings by using the word of God. I guess it was just wonderful to be forced to breed, marry have your children sold like livestock, to be whipped and sold in the market. Can't think of anything I'd rather be doing..."
2,open mind,"I have met read and listened to both authors on differing occasions and have been impressed with the intellect of each, including talks concerning the issues presented in this book. When did rational discussion become taboo? When someone mentions preprogrammed words (Terrorist) do you check your mind at the door? There was a time when Americans were free thinkers. Do you believe that THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS died to protect the right of their rich neighbors to keep slaves? I would encourage all to seek the truth concerning this presuppositional argument which turned America from what we were given as Greece, and Rome, and what we have become, everything else. Deo Vindice"
1,God is not American,"Um, can you Christians out there get any [...] You're starting to freak me out a bit. Maybe we need to review:Stay with me here... Bad Ideas:FascismNazisSlaveryApartheidConcentration CampsManzanarGenocideKilling all indigenous peopleNuclear WeaponsWars against AsiansSelling arms to Third World Dictators/Terrorists/AlliesRacismMurderVengeanceViolence(just to name a few)Signs that you might be headed down a wrong path:You believe that you (and worse, your people) are ""Chosen""And because you believe you are ""Chosen"" you believe it is ok or can justify doing any of the above ..."
1,Nitwits on Parade,"Another tribute to those Southern virtues: human slavery, rape, treason and rebellion. This guy is a nitwit, as can be proved by a quick glance at his other work. We need to learn to accept the reality principle, that slavery was as bad as they said, and that by ignoring it we fool ourselves into believing we're better than we are. Good luck with all that."
3,"Somewhere, my 4th grade teacher is smiling","I grew up in a very racist town in the South (our schools were not desegregated until 1971, and rather than desegregate our public swimming pools, our city council decided to shut them all down because they believed the mixing of races was immoral). My 4th grade teacher, a doyenne of the Daughters of the Confederacy, taught us that the Negros were happier under slavery than they were in modern days, that the slaves had been better cared for during slavery than white workers were in the North, and that Abraham Lincoln had violated the Constitution by taking plantation owner's property from them without giving compensation as called for in the Bill of Rights.It appears that some traditions, like apologism for slavery, do not die. Somewhere, my 4th grade teacher (long deceased now, 30 years later) is smiling."
1,A lightweight of literature,"This book tackels such heavy and serious topics as a) Slavery was not nearly as bad as we have been told b)There were not mass selling of families that caused them to be split up c) The slaves themeselves thought fondly of slavery d) Slaveholders were usually good Calvenist Christians who treated there slaves with tenderness and cared for their souls e)Black slave men would never have never allowed 'their women' to be sexually molested, and to say so would be racist .Unfortunately there is remarkably little factual basis for these beliefs within this book. The main points are either touted as known 'facts' or paraphrases from ONE slave narrative. Such a topic deserves sound and exhaustive historical facts to even begin to approach these subjects with serious thought. This book was a major dissapoinment."
5,Wonderful watch,I bought this watch for myself after I got tired of replacing watch batteries. I have a tiny wrist and have a hard time finding a watch that looks to be the right size for me. This was a perfect watch for me. Is great as a casual watch and the delicate bracelet is perfect for when I am dressing up more. It does not have a second hand but when charged the minute hand moves 1/3 of a minute every 20 seconds. Nice way to tell that it is running correctly without having a distracting second hand.I am a big fan of Citizen Eco-Drive now. It is one of two watches I wear on a regular basis now.
5,"great box, loaded with inserts","i bought 1 box of 2005 Sage Hit SEC Edition and the box was fantastic.You get 30 packs, 4 base cards and 1 insert card. Inserts included Blue and Silver Reflect cards. In total, i got 5 autographs, including:DeMarcus Ware Silver- Dallas Cowboys, DECarlos Rogers- Redskins, CBAlex Smith- Browns, TEVernand Morency- RB, Oklahoma Stand a Ciatrick Fason, RB, Florida ""The Write Stuff"" insert #'d 10 of 25The 1 jersey card was of the former #1 pick, Alex Smith of the 49ers.Overall, the box was awesome. I pulled a complete set and the 6 inserts were rock solid. I recommend. You can pull autographs of other players like Marion Barber, Aaron Rodgers, Ronnie Brown, Cadillac Williams, and i think Braylon Edwards.good box."
3,"Key word is ""Band Method""","This is a good book with good information, and simply introduced, but keep in mind that it's a ""band method."" Lots of short and simple songs to help teach music-reading skills and not much extra information (which would come from the band director, ideally). The book's a sight-before-sound kind of method, meaning that the focus is more on reading the notation than making music, and it's designed to be used in a band where the director also teaches.If you do buy this, consider a supplemental book that is more comprehensive (a chapter on cleaning the horn, how to practice, range, discography, etc.). It's an approach that also addresses listening and music-making:Sound the Trumpet: How to Blow Your Own Horn"
4,Glad to havvit,"The retraction is a little iffy, sort of like the old pulling on the shades or old video screen and hoping it will retract all the way. It sort of knarls up and you have to be deft and patient.But all in all I'm glad I have this thing to connect with built-in speakers in my classroom."
2,"Oh, I think I'll use this todaSPROING!","The thing literally exploded apart while I was extending it one morning. No unusual amount of force or anything. It just flew apart. The cable still works, but the mechanism is in pieces. I would fix it, but I can't even find where the other half of it shot off to."
2,Works great..for a month,"This retractable audio extension cable worked great for a month, but then broke. I've read about this happening to other types of retractable cords, so it's probably not just this particular one. They can be very fragile. Recommended only if it costs pennies."
3,Disappointing and convoluted follow-up to Blunt's first outing,"While I still like the characters of John Cardinal and Lise Delorme, the history of Canada's radical movement in the seventies was quite boring. The book starts with a grizzly murder as body parts are found in the woods. At first, it seems a bear is the culprit. Then another body is found in the woods. As Cardinal and Dolorme try to establish the connection between the two killings, they learn about a cover-up by the nation's intelligence organization, the CSIS, the involvement of the CIA, and the kidnapping and killing of a prominent cabinet member. This isn't as strong as the first book, and the link between Quebec's radical past and the killing of the young, female doctor is tangential, at best."
2,"Good writing, no resolution","An interesting series of events happen to the protagonist, a storm hits, a computer identifies the bad guy and the bad guy disappears. While the writing is well done,and the characters nicely developed, the story is less about the crime and catching the criminal than it is about the detective's day to day life. The plot involves an ice storm for no apparent reason, and the ending leaves no clue as to the whereabouts of the bad guy. It reads like a set up for a sequal. The unsatisfactory plot & ending rates a low 2 stars."
4,A solid follow-up to John Cardinal's debut,"Not as graphic as 'Forty Words for Sorrow' but with the weight of a once-in-a-century ice storm covering the investigation into a pair of seemingly unrelated murders, this story is just as compelling. Cardinal remains an interesting figure, not a perfect man, but a decent man, and there are ups and downs in his life and the investigation that mirror reality in its long-on-pain/short-on-bliss manner. If you're looking for that happy-ever-after ending, this is not the book for you. But if you like salt and grit layered in 3 inches of ice, this is one fine police procedural. I only wish I knew if Cardinal ever recommended Kiki B. for a job with Deckard!"
5,One of the best electric sharpeners you can buy,"This sharpener puts a great quick edge on knives. Some things to remember 1) Try just one pass first and see if that is good enough. This sharpener really sharpens quickly and one could oversharpen and remove too much metal very easily. 2) It leaves a slightly 'toothy' edge, which is better for a lot of actual cutting (tomatoes, bread, etc...), but this might be a turn off for some. 3) On point 2, one can turn off the machine and lightly use the stones for somewhat better edge or use a steel for a final edge.I like this better than the Chef'sChoice models because they leave marks on the sides of the blades (yes, this doesn't hurt the function, but I'm just fussy). Better than the Worksharp Sharpener because the flexibility of the belts allow too much variation. The McGowan gives the closest to a factory edge I've found from an electric sharpener."
3,It's ok.,"This product works fine; however, the cushion pad moves and it is very annoying. I might cut it off."
2,Can't remove it!,"The bar worked great and held really well for the first set of brackets, but held a little too well for the second set. I can't get the bar off anymore!!! The telescoping mechanism stopped working. If anyone has any suggestions..."
4,chin-up bar,"Great product. Installs easily. I had hoped I could just use it as a tension bar, but ended up needing to install the brackets as it tended to slip without them. I was unable to move the foam padding to the center; it's far too snug and will not budge."
1,Terrible quality,"I got this item from Big5 sporting goods. Had to return first one back to store for replacement - bar would not extend. Salesperson had to open and test several before found one which worked. Now, month later one fitting broke and bar almost injured my son. He is the only user of the bar, 10 and slim.It's a peace of junk."
1,Not sturdy enough / not portable,Caution! This chinning bar requires you to open 6 holes on the door frame for the 6 screws. Hence it is not portable by any means. Also it expands up to a point that is still not fixed hard against the frame; after this point the bar rotates without expanding! Big dissapointment from Everlast.
1,Dissappointing,Okay so you have to put 3 screws on each side of the doorway to install the holders. Only to realize that the thing doesn't even adjust that wide. It's not a wide doorway so I was dissappointed. It's not portable at all!
4,update on last review,"Ok, I recently gave online fitness a poor review due to the fact my package had gotten lost. I promised them that once I received it and the situation was resolved that I would update my review. So, here I am. The service turned out to be much better, they kept in good contact with me once I told them what happened. I did get my pull-up bar and it was in excellent condition. I havent gotten to use it yet as my b/f hasnt mounted it yet. But it is of high quality, and the bar isnt to big for me to fully grip, I really like the foam on there too! So the only reason I didnt do all five stars is that I havent gotten to actually use it yet. But so far it was exactly as it was described and of high quality. Better than any of my other pull-up bars I have had in the past. I will more than likely order with them again."
4,Good value pull up bar,"This pull up bar is basic but does the job.Installation was fair easy with a standard screwdriver but I'd recommend using a power tool to make it easier.Only complaint is that the cushion around the bar is only on the main part of the unextended bar so if you do wide grip pull ups one hand is on a cushion and one hand isn't.Otherwise, good buy!"
5,Excellent,This bar is comfortable and easy to install.. Doesnt harm your hands at all. I recommend it
2,"good bar, bad foam grip setup","Firstly, I must reiterate that you NEED to screw in the mounting-cups for this bar to hold you. Those that complain that this bar is not sturdy have most likely not installed the unit properly.Once properly installed, this is a good, solid chin-up bar.My biggest source of disappointment is the foam grip. It is only on one side of the bar. The manual says that the user should simply push the foam grip over to the center. Well, it is practically impossible. I have tried several times, I don't see how one can do it. I managed to tear the foam grip in my efforts.The bar still does its job perfectly, even without the foam grip.Bottom line - if you want a solid and affordable bar, get this. If you care about the foam grip - shop around for a different product."
5,Awesome!,This chin-up bar works great. It only took a few minutes to install and it looks good. I weigh about 230 and it supports my weight without any problems. Great product for a great price!
2,Questionable mounting configuration,"Took it out of the box, took 5 minutes to set it up, and propmtly ripped one of the flimsy mounting brackets off of the wall during its first use. I definitely would not let children use this item without supervision. The bar itself is of good quality. But the brackets have to go."
3,Everlast Chin- & Sit-up Bar,"I got what I ordered. BUT, and it's a huge BUT...I tightened it as far as it would go before it would bust my door jams. Yet the bar still spins around. Making it a hell of a lot harder to do chin ups. I've never had a chin up bar that spun while you use it. I'm disappointed, had I known it would have done this after installing. I would have purchased a bar actually worth using. I'd gighly suggest you stick to a metal chin up bar. This bar is pretty much only good for sit ups, and that's it."
5,Every well furnished home should have one,"I'm an Army officer and a big fan of Tony horton's P90X program.I use the Everlast Chin-up/Sit-up bar every other day.It is easy to install and easy to use. I use the bar and then remove it. It stores easily.The competing products are both wildly more expensive, and, in my experience, much, much harder to use and store.Whether you are in a studio apartment, a dorm room, a CHU somewhere in the Middle East, or in a single family dwelling, the Everlast Chin-up/Sit-up bar is the way to go.I could go on and on, but those are the facts that matter.in service,Rich"
2,Lacks stability,"Looks good, installs fine, but darn near impossible to tension the bar sufficient to keep it from rotating when used. Bought this for my budding gymnast daughter, but it's such a pain to put up and tighten that we're just not using it. YMMV"
4,Great,"This chin up bar works perfectly as described. The padding on the bar is a nice addition and wont hurt too much if you run your head into it. The only problems I had with it, is that while installing, the instructions didnt suggest pre-drilling holes into the door frame. This helps the wood not crack during installation. Otherwise, instructions are very easy to follow and the frame is very sturdy. Im about 180lbs and have had no problems with it. It also comes with two extra frame mounts to allow you to move the bar from a chin up bar to a bar to hold your feet down for sit ups. Overall a great product."
2,Didn't fit in my doorframes,"My bedroom has two doors of different sizes, and this bar didn't fit in either one. I'm moving out soon, and I'm hoping my new place has doors which will work. Maybe it will suit me then. But I should have spent a little extra and bought one that doesn't require drilling into the door frame."
4,review,"good sturdy construction, though it is a little hard to deploy the thing to is full lenght, nothing a drop of wd 40 wont solve."
3,"Good book for power tuning, useless for the less ambitious.","The book explains quite a lot, but there are some areas in which the book seriously lacks. For instance it fails to identify the differences in the cylinderhead that comes from a cable or piston driven gas pedal, and it actually suggests buying a whole new engine so it is exactly like the one in the book, so you can tune it. Might be good for the cash-loaded reader, but not for the price-aware tuner."
2,A quick look back into poor camera work and sound.,"This tape is a compilation of edited performances of several groups. It is poor quality black and white and was recorded at a time when there was no thought given to stereo or quality sound sent out on the airways..if you are a true affecianodo of any of these groups, it is camp, otherwise don't bother."
5,Frankie Avalon is Great!!!,"Frankie Avalon is the host of this 1 hr black and white show.Frankie Avalon sings many songs of the 1960's in this May 11,1965 show.If you like Frankie Avalon then you should enjoy."
2,A quick look back into poor camera work and even poorer lips,"This tape is a compilation of edited performances of several groups. It is poor quality black and white and was recorded at a time when there was no thought given to stereo or quality sound sent out on the airways..if you are a true affecianodo of any of these groups, it is camp, otherwise don't bother."
5,My daughter loves this book!,"My 3 year old daughter loves this book! Beautiful drawings of flowers and butterflies. The drawback was that for a couple months after getting this book, we had to read it every night, and we had to name every butterfly on every page. ""What kind of butterfly is this?"" ""That's a Monarch butterfly."" ""What kind of butterfly is this?"" ""That's a Tiger swallowtail butterfly."" I'm sure that's good in the long run, but holy cow, she was obsessed with this book! :) Thankfully, the obsession dwindled a bit, and now we can enjoy our occasional readings of the book together. I do recommend this book!"
5,Great and Colorful!,"This is a colorful rhyming book, from the birth of an egg, to a caterpillar, to butterfly. The book talks about the life cycle of butterflies. After the story there are several pages that share information about butterflies. At the end of the book there are pages about the different types of butterflies with pictures to identify them. Each of the butterflies also includes a picture of the caterpillar it was before it became a butterfly. There is a page of information about butterflies, labeling each part of the butterfly and information about butterflies. The last page of the book has information about flowers, with a picture to describe the flower.This would be a great book for first grade. The rhyming patterns make the book easy to follow. A teacher would be able to introduce butterflies and the different parts of them. As a class they could create a timeline of the butterflies, from the start as an egg."
1,arived damaged,"I was disapointed after waiting two months to receive the new book, only to discover that one of the pages had a 2 inch rip on it.It was not wrapped up in the box, there was only some air filled plastic on top of the book. It rattled around in the box."
2,Just O.K.,"... I was disappointed when I actually got the book. It may be good for the 1-3-year-old set, but my 4-year-old is much more sophisticated about butterflies than this book addresses. For the same money, there are alot of other books that have more beautiful artwork. Don't waste your money-check this one out from the library instead!"
2,Two big cracks but still sturdy enough to be assembled,"This bookcase came quickly and had free shipping, which I was very happy with but when I opened it I discovered that there was a crack horizontally across each of the bookcase's sides. The package weighed 96 lbs and was a pain to get into my apartment so I wasn't willing to repackage and return it. I was still able to assemble the shelf and load it completely with books but it bows out where the cracks are and the cracks are obvious when looking at the sides of the shelf."
4,Surprisingly worth the money!,"I bought these hoping they would be sturdier than the discount bookcases they were replacing. I couldn't be happier. The shelves are very sturdy and while they go together easily like cheap ones, they don't feel or look like cheap ones.Rather than just a load-bearing poster of paneling in the back, there is an actual back piece that goes from the floor to the fixed shelf. This adds sturdiness and helps prevent the loaded bookcase from falling over.I received them in better than expected condition, which was a bonus. The only possible negative is that the variable shelves aren't as wide front-to-back as the fixed shelf. So, if you're like me and have to have them all the same profile to the front, there's a space left in the back. However, the shelves themselves are quite deep, so this is a minor problem at the very most--that is, you're not going to drop books back there."
2,I Agree with Mr. Seifert,"Limited to areas along U.S. 50; could have expanded the book to cover U.S. 6, 93, and 95. Rather simplistic in writing style and tone. Would have liked more detailed geology of the areas the authors did cover."
1,Not worth it,This dragon snapper has a flimsy handle that breaks easily and then the toy is useless. The supplier also overcharges on shipping and handling and won't package multiple snappers in one package. So the price of each toy is much more than advertised.
1,"Nothing sells like the word ""Masonic""","Just because someone puts the word ""Masonic"" on something doesn't make it worthwhile for a Freemason to buy. Such is the case with this CD. The music quality on high-end equipment sounds like it was being played through the 8-track in an old AMC Pacer (yes, I owned one of those!). If you were looking for music for anything to do with a lodge presentation, don't waste your money on this or its sister product, Volume 2."
5,Greatly Helpful book!,This is brilliant book for those who are interested in narrative research methods. The problems of narrative and genre are described/addressed in a complete and highly professional way.Strongly recommended for those interested in social scineces/ women's/gender studies/history etc.
2,Disappointing,"Has a very ugly face. Bought it as a gift for my Marine, and was too ashamed of it to give it.Will probably send it to school for a gift exchange."
5,An amazing movie,"Ah, the joys of watching a really good movie. I saw this on DVD a couple of years ago, and I was really impressed. It has everything one could want in a samauri picture. Beheadings, sword fights, sake drinking and sex. Of course, not the type of sex that most americans would be able to picture amongst Samauri, but then it is/was a different culture than our own. The movie is beautifully photographed, the lead is just stunning to look at, and the whole story is fascinating.All-in-all, a great film.Highest rating."
4,Enjoyable and intellectually stimulating.,"This movie was very enjoyable to watch. There are a lot of layers in the storyline, the scenery is great, the costumes are great, and the acting, especially, is great.The movie is basically a bunch of psychological examinations of the characters with great sword fighting sequences in the middle (it seems like most of the actors know how to sword fight themselves without stunt doubles). A very intellectually stimulating movie.DO NOT see this movie if you are interesting in learning about the homosexual community in Japan. The movie is fiction and it certainly does not try to venture into social commentary. The movie does not address social oppression or even how the characters feel about their homosexuality with any remote introspection. That is actually the reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5. It only vaguely awkwardly addresses the aforementioned things in one tiny subplot."
3,OK...,"Quality is ok, the wood is more of a cherry tone vs. espresso brown. I wish the salt shaker was a salt mill, but it's ok."
5,Very Nice Set!,"These are quality made and work great, love them! We have gifted several sets of these over the years and they are always well received."
3,Blistered from Heat of Stove,"I was thoroughly satisfied with this product until yesterday. I had them sitting on my stove. I've used my stove and oven several times and hadn't had a problem. Yesterday, I used my broiler, which is at the top of the oven. I smelled burning and couldn't figure out what it was. Then I saw that my peppermill and salt shaker were blistering from the heat of the broiler. I was surprised this happened because I didn't think the surface of the stove would get that hot. Not sure if this is a product issue or not, but just a warning to other buyers"
3,Not bad.,"This is a cute set. I really like the peppermill. The salt shaker has a defect on top, it's off-center and raised. This was likely just a problem with the salt shaker I received. Overall, it's not bad."
5,Reasonable price.,"After searching for a salt and pepper mill combo for some time, I finally purchased the Olde Thompson peppermill and salt shaker. They look and work great!"
4,Good quality merchandise,I am very pleased with this purchase. The pepper grinder works very well with just the right coarseness. Would purchase again.
5,"Great look, great price, great product.","This salt shaker and pepper mill is just the right combination of form and function. The low price does not, in any way, result in an inferior product. The action of the pepper mill is smooth and the flakes are uniform; one thing to watch out for is the flow as the pepper comes out rather fast with just a small turn.Some reviews complained about the product appearing more black than brown. It certainly does appear more black than brown and the name ""Espresso"" implies this. They look precisely like the picture: a very dark brown.The salt shaker loads from the bottom; a rubber flange pushes into the hole to keep the salt in. This was a bit surprising but I don't expect it will be a real problem. Removing the screw from the top of the pepper mill frees the knob revealing a fairly small interior (about half a spice-size jar of pepper corns)."
1,Boring Cd,Man what happened to Mo Thugs. All I gotta say is this cd is pretty lame like some reviewers said. And to the others that gave this cd over 1 star u must have been smokin crack when u were listening to this cd. There are only 3 decent tracks on this album. But if you like Bone its worth a listen. I'd download it not buy it.
5,All Horse Systems Go,Excellent book. A must for horse owners who see their equines as amazing athletes. Really liked the section on conformation!
1,WARNING DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM!,"WARNING DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE.I ORDERED THE ABOVE PICTURED ITEM BY FRONTIER NATURAL IN THE FOIL BAG. WHAT I RECEIVED WAS SOMETHING IN A PLASTIC BOTTLE MARKED OTTO'S.I'M SORRY THIS SMACKS OF FRAUD......."
2,Too much recycled material here,"Much of this - and I mean MUCH of this - most Carlin fans already own in one capacity or another. A lot of this consists of material drawn from his ""You Are Diseased"" record and other older stuff as well, so if you're already a fan, steer clear. Having his material prsented in an audiobook format (him in a studio reading into a microphone with no crowd interplay) just deadens much of the material and makes you overly conscious of how he does the magic. There are times when he reads off stuff that, when you hear it live, you think is aside material (the errant curse word, the witty follow-up). When presented here, this normally dicey flavor just comes off scripted and flat.Stick to his live records. This is just an attempt to stay in the mix because the book versions do so well (bearing in mind, the books basically codify his stage material beyond the excellent ""Brain Droppings"" tome)."
2,Why would You Get This Published,WHAt Kind of an as*h*** writes down 300 pages of questions and doesnt give one f***ing answer. Think About that Eh!
2,ASL on the Go,"I like these videos, but I have to say they are a bit advanced for someone with no ASL experience at all. Just a thought..."
1,Worst Construction of a Barbie ever,"My girls love them but the wings, clothes, and shoes simply fall off ALL THE TIME. They won't stay on, and the skirt thing snapped in half almost immediately. Of all the myriad Barbies they have, these are the most poorly constructed, cheap feeling ones they have ever had.Very poor quality. And they're not cheap, either. Too bad."
2,There is absoulotley nothing wrong with this toy 2,I think the manufacture's note about the bracelets had been mixed up with another toy product that concerns Jewlia and Crystal. Thet're going to be making little lands for crystal and Jewlia. A part of both products turns into braclets so it's possible they got the toy identity wrong when they said there were braclets.
4,Pretty-But Not Really A Toy,"This doll is really pretty! So pretty, that I confiscated it off of my kids! She has such pretty hair, it seems a shame to let children ruin it. Her clothes fall off really easily, so it's hard to keep a descent outfit on her. My children did like the way she ""lit up"".Not very educational, but then again,I didn't buy it for that."
3,Designed for kids,"before I got the doll, I was really excited to get it. but when I got it, I was somewhat disappointed. because I didn't realize it was not designed for a collector. it was designed for little kids. her eyes are too big. her hair was too much cute (over exaggerated). so I took her hair down, restyled her hair, repainted her eyes, and ironed her hair a little to flatten the poofness. and she looks good now. so I still like the doll, but just not in the original way."
2,THIS IS TO COOL GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,MY MEMA SENT ME THIS TOY BUT MAMA DOSE NOT WANT ME TO SEE TOYS THAT HAVE BOOBS AND WHERE TUMMY SHIRTS!NO ONE SHOULD SEE THAT!MY COUSIN THAT LIVES IN SUPERIOR AND HER FRIEND IN WRENSHALL ARE ALWYS PLAYING COOL GIRL GAMES!
3,beautiful yet breakable,"My daughter recieved this doll and the similar Crystal doll for Christmas (2005). The dolls were beautiful and my daughter was so excited. Yet, when you take her out of the box her ""skirt"" falls off AND falls apart! I had to hot glue the thing twice, and it still wouldn't stay together and on the doll! For the money that I paid for these dolls I expected alot more."
3,not too bad,"This doll is very beautiful way more than Crystal,however its cloth is a bit hard to put on and the wings fall quit a bit. Other than that its a good doll for older people 9 and up. I believe Matel needs to improve it's quality though."
5,A Must Read,"I am an avid reader of the Wall Street Journal, and I've been reading articles by Mitch Pacelle for some time. Some of the most interesting articles have been about the Empire State Building. For me, the older story revolving around the origins of the building and the skyscraper wars is as interesting as the cut-throat battle between the big guys in real estate such as Donald Trump, Leona Helmsley and Peter Malkin. This book will not disappoint any serious nonfiction reader with the highest standards. I found the legal battles particularly engrossing as well as the relationship between the odd Renoir and the bizarre Yokoi."
5,I can't believe I read this book like a novel!,"I couldn't put this book down until I found out who really owned the Empire State Building. The fighting, bickering, backstabbing amongst the rich is always something I enjoy reading. I really wanted to know why people were fighting for ownership of this building. The book does a real good job of detailing the court proceedings, and real estate lingo which sometimes made my eyes glaze over but I enjoyed the flow of the book of keeping the story moving from character to character and believe me, there are many of them here including Donald Trump, Leona Helmsley, Hideki Yokoi, and Peter Malkin. So this is what people do when they have too much time on their hands."
4,"Fascinating tale of greed, passion, and hatred","This book is a complex but riveting tale of how the Empire State Building inspires not just affection for a classic American icon, but incredible greed, hatred, and pretty much all of the seven deadly sins. This is also a peek behind the curtain of big time real estate, and a seriously unflattering portrait of most of its practitioners. Absolutely recommended for anyone who wants dirt on Leona Helmsley, or has a vague dislike for Donald Trump. None of these characters, especially the Japanese (both the Yokoi family and the Japanese bankers), comes off as particularly admirable. Very good."
3,A well told tale of buccaneers of New York real estate,"Pacelle does a fine balanced job of telling a tangled story, littered with scoundrels and pirates, stretching from New York to Tokyo to the chateaux country of France. The book predates 9/11 and the recent death of Leona Helmsley but the author does not hide his distaste for the ""Queen of Mean"" and his guarded admiration for the ""rational opportunist"" Donald Trump. Part Big Apple commercial real estate, part law, this fast paced book focuses on the main points as a means to moving the story along and the structure holds the reader until the end."
3,"An interesting story, but too long.","This is indeed an interesting story, with a colorful cast (Donald Trump and Leona Helmsley among them) and some unexpected twists and turns. However, it's a story more suited to the scope of a VANITY FAIR or NEW YORKER article, and at over 300 pages it wears out its welcome. I was also curious about the history of the building from its construction on up to the beginning of Pachelle's main narrative, and sadly that history is only outlined fairly briefly. Not a bad book, but its length quickly exceeded my interest."
2,Beware : This is Recorded on the Wrong Instrument!,The piano simply cannot capture the character or charm of this music no matter how much artificial reverb is added by the engineers. It all comes out comparatively lifeless and unvaried. If you must buy this recording please also check out a harpsichord version.
2,Coup,"The Haydn fan (below) makes some interesting points, but his grammar is lousy (""compare either ladies playing"") and his tastes are questionable. To wit, he is way wrong on Marcelle Meyer, whose survey of Rameau, Couperin and Scarlatti, among others, on the EMI ""Les Introuvables"" series is one of my favorite keyboard recordings of all time, while Horowitz's frenetic Scarlatti pales next to Maria Tipo's. As for the snippets of the heavily reverbed Hewitt I sampled, avoid."
5,self-referential visual communicator extraordinaire!,"I've just picked up Reinventing Comics and am overwhelmed with the same feeling I had when I first saw Understanding Comics.I am in the business of trying to caste new visual (and full-sensorium) idioms for understanding abstract information in scientific disciplines. Scott's books are incredible sources for insight into the discipline of communicating with other than words.Scott's view of the worlds we create with our imaginations and the way we can send consistent, rich, clear signals using minimal tools (pen & ink?) is awesome.It will take years for the rest of us to catch up with Scott's work, but in the meantime I am sure I will read and reread his work as I once did my Marvel and DC comics.This time it is work!"
4,Scott McCloud has helped legitimize an art form....,"This book is great in it's exploration of the topic and giving us beautiful new perspective on one of the most under rated and overlooked art forms. However, this book doesn't reach the peak that McCloud reached in his masterpiece ""Understanding Comics"" simply because of the more technical tone and the more specific relevance. His first book not only expanded minds on the idea of comic art or ""sequential art"" but he also expanded minds on the world in general and how we as humans express ourselves in life. This newer book expands on comic specific ideas so it loses the broad relevance. Still a must read for anyone who believes in this art form... and we all should."
2,"Hard to read, distracting format, nothing new.","Maybe this review is unfair, as I could honestly not get through the entire book. This book is written in a sort of graphic-novel format, which is innovative and interesting at first. As the book gets into more complex concepts, it is INCREDIBLY distracting to have every five-to-twenty-word phrase accompanied by its own (often abstract) image, sending your eyes hunting through the comic panel for the continuation of the sentence you are trying to read. Of what I read, most was fairly obvious and basic: the three-page introduction on Understanding Comics was easily the most worthwhile part I read, and I will probably read the author's original book. This one, however, was an irritating bore."
2,"They were right, unfortunately","Understanding Comics (the prequel) amazed me so much that I couldn't believe those negative reviews. McCloud can get a little dense sometimes, so I figured that the reviewers simply didn't want to put any effort into it.Ahem.It appears that I was a fool.Mr. McCloud did seemingly go delirious over the success of the former book and the power of his new Macintosh computer, so he felt justified in dishing out the ultimate critique of market cycles. According to him, at the least.Well, unfortunately for each good point, he gets six quite wrong and four desperately off the mark.Nothing you really need to read. Especially in these post-new economy bubble times."
1,Reheated drivel,"Devoid of nything resembling an insight or new idea, this book is as turgid and boring as Understanding Comics was deft and clever. Having enjoyed McCloud's work for some time, I was let down to find this book full of boring ""new"" media and ""new"" business claptrap."
2,Deceiving!,"This is one of those (rare) ocasions where the first book is excelent, and the second one is awful! How sad... The only good parts are the ones borrowed from ""Understanding Comics"". I was deeply disapointed..."
4,Great to use to teach alliteration,I used this book to teach alliteration! Not only is it funny but it is also a meaningful book to use for writer's workshop! It also gets the kids ready for school picture day.
2,Didn't impress me.,"I rated this 2 stars because I wasnt impressed with it. Also, because in the DVD they used a longer roll and I can't use the roll I purchased with it. Mine is short and bigger around. Will never use it."
3,A good collection,"At 9.5 x 7 inches, this is not a coffee table book. However it is a good photographic study of Paris printed on high quality paper and generally labled with at least the general area the photo was taken. I would recommend this book for first time visitors to Paris. It offers a sound preview, but sadly excruciating little information. Look to guide books for that."
3,"quality of pictures is not the best, yet the composition is pretty good","Since this book has pictures taken a long time ago with film, the granulations can be seen and it feels like some of the photos are old.I didnt read it all becouse it was a gift and I didnt had the time but after around 30 minutes I got bored becouse the pictures are not striking and beautiful enough. I am a photographer and that could be making my review a little more demanding but still I feel im being just.I was deciding between this book and another one with aerial shots from paris and wish I could have selected the other and maybe enjoy a diffent angle even if the pictures were old as well."
2,Attention Frida fans! For the devoutest of the devout only.,"I had a hard time figuring out what the director had in mind with this tribute to Frida. Is this a play? A documentary? A poetry reading? Inserted into the very overwrought and sometimes embarrassing histrionics are some very fascinating reminiscences by people who actually knew the artist. The video is worth it just for that. But the acting was so bad and the concept so pretentious that I had my finger on the fast forward much of the time.I'd almost ask for my money back, but the collector in me says no."
3,Spanish Language,This is primarily a narration that could have been done in English rather than Spanish. The screen consists mostly of Frida's art and photographs that you can't satisfactorily enjoy because you are busy reading the English subtitles while the narration is in Spanish.
4,Great documentary,A great informational documentary on the work and life of Frida Kahlo. Very informative and useful in my classroom to give my students a sense of Kahlo and her work.
2,Soooo BAD!!,"I am a huge Frida fan and probably seen every documentary ever made. I'm sorry to say that ""A Ribbon Around A Bomb"" was a BOMB! The interview's with Frida's students and people she knew were interesting - but the ""skits"" in between were awful. The woman who played the part of Frida was a good actress, but if I wanted to see Frida's life acted out, I'd just rent FRIDA with Salma Hayek (greatest movie ever!). Almost the entire documentary was ""skits"". Very very dissapointing."
1,Cleaning pens,"Didn't work! I kept swiping and swiping, but the printer never came clean. Then I used the cleaning cards, which didn't work either. Big waste of money!"
1,FAIL,"I bought this item to bump my overall order over the $25.00, free shipping threshold. What a waste. I should've just paid for the items I actually wanted. This would have been fun and worthwhile if both wheels worked! But alas one does not and the product is a failure. I can't gift it because it's a toy and what kid wants a toy that only ""kind of"" works? In the trash it goes, boo."
2,Subtext.,"The subtext to André Gorz's Work, is: Any valid metric by which the efficacy of politics may be judged, must be eliminated from the minds of the polity.Thus, Gorz wilfully and misleadingly maligns capitalism, via which, a mere 4% makes it possible for almost everyone else to have a job, beyond the likes of subsistence farming and the associated quality of life, which most of France endured, prior to WW1.The criticism of the car industry is a consequence of labour, which had come to own capital by way of exchanging labour for money, and relinquished that ownership to a party, such as their pension and/or insurance funds, which then, by investing in the car industry, effectively meant that labour was paying itself to detrimentally maintain that line of work, instead of choosing to direct that capital towards new lines of production, and using some of their savings to carry them over the transition period, and/or utilise the millions of un/underemployed scientists and engineers."
4,Dos & Don'ts,"I got the book for my brother as a Christmas gift. He liked it and i found that the info giveing in the book was helpful for any one thinking of going to Thailand. If you or someone you know is going to Thailand for the first time, i think that the book would be a good idear for you/them. Some of the hints were ""don't rise your voice or get angrey"". ""don't make fun of the royal familey"" and genral things that would be useful to know when in Thailand."
3,First Season Syndrome,"Like The Man From UNCLE,The Wild Wild West suffered from a condition called FIRST SEASON SYNDROME.Both of these shows never repeated the greatness of their premier seasons,the terrific scripts,direction and freshness just were not as good in the preceding seasons.Having said that S4 of The Wild Wild West is still entertaining to watch and seeing Jim and Artie in action at any time is always a pleasant experience. (except for the hideous movie Hollywood movie,what an abomination!)"
4,"Wild Wild West, Fourth Season DVD","Haven't had a chance to watch all of the episodes, but this is pretty comparable to the 3rd season."
4,Wild Wild West,I enjoied the shows but the only problem I had is that when I received the package most of the tabs that hold the dvd's in place where broken off. Other than that the movies seem to be in good shape.
2,DVD rot rampant,"I love the show and the packaging is nice, but all of my CBS TV dvd titles are getting bad cases of DVD rot.(an oily looking stain on the playing side. This release is no exception.Your prized and expensive DVD set may not be playable in a few years even without a single scratch. And I thought Universal's double sided disks were bad. At least they come unscathed when new."
5,Best TV show ever!,Love having these forever in my collection. I have the entire program; would love to have the made for TV movies some day. I loved this show as a kid; my favorite. I wrote to Ross Martin every week and got an autographed picture from him. I will always be a very big fan of this show. Nothing else has ever compared to it. I like it as much at 56 as I did when I was 13. You can't go wrong owning this.
4,Wild Wild West season 4,"I have purchased all 4 seasons that have been released of the tv series The Wild, Wild West. I love the show and the stars. They are neatly packaged and easy to view.I am however extremely disappointed in the lack of special features after the first season was released. Mr. Martin and Mr. Conrad deserve better. As someone who has put about 120$ into the DVD's, I deserve better. Shame on the company that is putting these DVD's together. You owe me a special DVD of extras in my opinion.I think the price is too much for what you receive. Drop the price or increase the extra's."
5,Smooth,"I've been wanting to purchase this cd for awhile now and I was finally able to. It is incredibly smooth and something to chill out too. The pace for most songs are slow, and get you into a flow, which is something I like a lot.If you would like to have an alternative style to your current collection of trance, techno, electronica, or even ambient this is a definite winner."
4,Good for beginners,"I thought that I would embroider the whole picture. But it turned out, that only some flowers and the bird are left for embroidery, there is nothing to do with the rest of the picture"
5,HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION,"When these tongs arrived I could not believe the old-fashion quality of this product! It is sturdy and the 9"" size fits the hand comfortably. I used it today to turn a steak instead of using a fork. The control is perfect and makes this product safer to use than traditional tong designs. I especially like the sure-fire locking mechanism."
1,Remastered? Really?,"Sorry: I have not heard the quality of the earlier CD releases of these Blackhawk sets, but having recently bought a bucket load of remastered Miles Davis albums (all glorious and fantastic quality) I can only suggest something went wrong with this one. My Mark Levinson 390S is turned up louder than ever before just to get a decent earful. Sounds lousy, Mr. Mark Wilder of Sony Music Studios New York. Suggest checking these discs out before you buy.P.S After listening to the quality of Monk and Coltrane from Carnegie Hall in 1957 please don't tell me the problem is the venue!"
5,We can't stop listening to it!,Simple Song is simply the best! I have a copy in my office and in my car! Can't wait to see more from Matt!
1,Not my cup of tea,"I read through this the other night. Lots of pretty colors and eye candy, but ultimately this book was deeply unsatisfying. Edward Gomez does a hack job of piecing the ideas together and forming coherent perspectives on various movements within the world of graphic design. Not recommended."
3,there are better books out there,"This is a TimeLife book, so buyer beware, it is what it is. There are far far worse books on Paris out there. This one is just tedious, the pictures aren't great, and like so many books, it is pretty much, once again, the over-visited same old same old, and the pictures, printing, and overall execution do not make this tome worthy of the coffee table. The nightstand, ..... ?.... ""Yes!"", absolutely!, which is way above the ""qualifies for the loo"" rating I'll give another book. In other words, skip it unless you are both familiar with the standards for TimeLife books, i.e., about 30% of them are worth it (WWII happens to be excellent!) and a glutton for punishment; there are better books out there."
5,Awesome!!,These have to be the best CD/DVD holders out right now. I have an extensive DVD collection and I don't have to have a wall full of movies. These binders hide themselves in a eligant fasion while still staying very accessable. I highly recommend this product.
1,"Might be nice if it arrives not bent, broken or warped.",Got two of these and they were sent in a box with no packing material and looked like they were run over by a truck BEFORE being placed in the box. The outer panels were warped and bowed. If you try to straighten them out you will break the cheap cardboard they are made of. No response from Amazon or the seller about this so I have only the feedback recourse...
4,curved binder,"The binder does what its supposed to do, but the covers of the binder are curved inwards. I suppose this to help it stand up, but it sucks cause it limits how many cds you may put in the binder with out it looking over filled."
5,Liz liked this item,"Bought this for my neice. She says they are great. Let's her organize all her disks and keep them clean. Not too expensive, and they work"
4,A Quality Binder,I loaded this up with all of my PC software. The inserts are your average nylon/plastic cd holders. What's really cool is the exterior of the binder. The faux leather feels and looks great.
5,We got our shelf space back!,Received item very quickly and matched description. We have recovered some very valuable shelf space by using this product. The number of pages that come with the binder seem skimpy until you fill it up with dvds and covers.
3,Just OK...,"This item arrived with the cover warped but I didn't feel like dealing with returning it so I just decided to live with it. It is the best looking binder I was able to find but if you don't care about looks you probably want to go elsewhere, they are very expensive for the cheap quality. Also, skip buying the inserts, I bought two packages and it was a total waste, if you are completely filling it up with DVDs only about two extra pages will fit in."
2,Not as efficient as I thought it would be.,The binder is very pleasing to the eyes and looks great on a book shelf. I really like the idea of this product but it just doesn't hold enough DVDs. I purchased some extra binder sleeves but cannot use them because none of them will fit in the binder. It will only hold the number of sleeves that it comes with.I will continue to use:Atlantic 74604729 Movie Sleevesand stay away from binders.
4,Storage Binder,It is a good way to storage your cd's. But be ware that the ring holds just the amount of pages it comes with. If you buy extra pages they will not fit.
5,Best binder ever !,"If you are looking for ways to store your cds and dvds in a decorative setting, this is the binder you are looking for.The best thing about this binder is it looks like a book in my library; it is not too wide and it doesn't extend beyond the size of other books. It comes only in black though, I wish we could have more options."
1,Too Flawed to Function,"I just ordered four of these, based on reviews. Unfortunately, the covers are so curved that they take up twice as much space as necessary, and don't fit on a shelf together. Something about the combination of materials and glue on the covers has warped them in a counter-clamshell fashion: they look fine empty, but fill them with DVDs and the free edges have spread out an additional 4"".These will be returned, and another solution sought."
2,Not as it advertises itself,"I was looking for a nice way to store a bunch of DVDs with their inserts, and this binder looked just right. But the actual storage pockets are only wide enough for the disks - the inserts are wider than that, so you cannot put one in there unless you fold and crease the insert further. (I added a user image to show this.) If you are willing to damage your inserts, then you can practically use any CD sleeve, and you don't need a DVD binder. This binder claims to hold the inserts too, it even has a picture of one on the packaging - that I consider a stretch and deceptive advertising, so I'm returning it."
2,Not the same as other colors by same manufacturer....,"I've purchased several burgundy binders and then added the black ones for organization of DVDs, as well as computer software and digital pictures. I will NEVER purchase the black again. The burgundy I purchased were a fine quality. I just figured the black were more inexpensive due to the color. Not so! The outer binder is bent outward in all of them. The paper lining the inside of the binder is not glued down sufficiently in places and wrinkled in others.Overall, they have a cheap look and feel to them, as if they won't last half as long as the burgundy ones. If I decide I want to purchase a different color for organizational purposes, next time I will choose the brown. I am using these because, frankly, I was too lazy to send them back."
2,Meh.,"Looks cool but the side kind of flair out I don't know why.. you figure it would be straight like a ""book"" 2 Stars."
4,Easy and convenient,"Before shopping at here, I had no idea they made CD cases like this - in an easy to use binder. Figured I would have to get some kind of case. The binder stays on the front passenger seat and is easy and convenient to get to, and it looks nice."
2,Scratched and therefore returned,"I can only give this item two stars as it was beautifully designed, but there were scratches on it when I took it out of the packaging. For this reason, I returned it but for those who order this item and it doesn't come with scratches, I think they probably will be very pleased."
2,Warped Covers!,"The covers are so curved outward on the product that if you fill it with any amount of discs, the product takes up a whole 4-5"" on your shelf. It's very frustrating. Oh, and don't try to gently bend the covers back in shape; they will just fold and look even worse. Live and learn, I guess. I would suggest searching elsewhere for your DVD organization needs."
5,Great look and space saver!,"These are a great change to save space in our living room with my massive collection of dvds. I like the style and there are 3 colors to choose from. The label is not the easiest to remove and use, and it says it holds many more cds/dvds than in actuality. The 3 ring binder part holds more than the book will. When the binder is full, the book fans out but it holds about 15/16 pages full, less if you add a lot of the paperwork. There is also space to attach the booklets that come in the dvds. The pages come out easy for sorting and adding more movies/cds (I like to alphabatize)."
3,Nice for some things,These are nice looking. Don't know how much space you'll save since they are quite large. Not good for DVD movies as the covers won't fit in. Work really well if you have back ups or software that doesn't need paper work with it. I guess you can keep the album art for a CD but then you have room for fewer CDs. I'll use them for back ups of music I bought online.
4,Classy,These binders are a very classy way to store your CDs.The labels on the binder are a bit cheap though.
2,Not Exactly What You Think,"i had very high hopes for these binders, especially being that they weren't cheap. unfortuneately they LOOK cheap and are MADE cheap. They got here sort of bent up a bit and the inside is merely glued on paper to the supposed 'leather' exterior! One of them had the paper bent and starting to tear away already.They come with 20 pages and you can buy more pages - which i did......i added 8 more.......and then the book doesn't close.........so there is a ton of wasted space with these.I plan on keeping them and using them just for the kids Dvd's ......being that they'll probably fall apart by poor craftmanship anyway.....but i will buy something way better for my Dvd and CD collections.All in all - just plain old not worth it and not anywhere near a good looking in person!!!!!!!"
4,Nicest I've found,"These are the nicest disc storage binders I've found. It's fake leather, but well finished. It's maybe a bit overpriced for what it is (they seem to have a corner on the market for bookshelf-presentable binders. The insert pages are high-quality. Just A few caveats: supposedly these books are expandable with additional insert pages; this is only marginally true, as you can only get a couple of extra pages in before it becomes impossible to close it flat, particularly if you include inserts. If you store them upright (as on a bookshelf) the pages tend to slump down and if you are not careful you can jam them up when you return the binder to the shelf. But, overall, no real complaints."
3,"Okay, but DVD coverslips do not fit in pockets as shown","Got these to hold my son's DVDs as he has broken a couple DVDs trying to pop them out of the cases. Works fine for storage for him, but the covers for the DVDs do not fit in the sleeves as shown...you would have to cut them. I've solved the problem by printing out pictures of the DVD covers as large thumbnails and sticking them to the appropriate sleeve...this also allows us to use more of the space for actual DVDs, but am still disappointed that the system does not work as shown."
1,Buyer beware of reviews,"Buyer beware. There are many false reviews floating around the internet on this product. I was searching for the lowest price and came across several 5star reviews that were identical and posted on various sites. This is usually the company doing fake reviews to boost their sales...dishonest and a poor business practice.I purchased one of these for cheaper from a different online retailer and it was ok. The quality is marginal, but they do look ok from the outside (a little cheap looking). One thing is that they only come with 12 sheets and charge you a buck twenty five for each additional sheet. 12 full sheets does not 'fill' out the binder. I got my extra sheets cheaper at office supply store or online. They do get dusty though on the inside as one of the other reviewer's mentioned. Otherwise they work as stated, but the honesty of the company must come into question when they post fake reviews."
2,GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS DIDNT UNDERSTAND IT,my mom purchased this book for me for christmas at borders bargain book section(yes mom i saw the sticker) and i found that it was in a textbook format. i read the first chapter and thought to myself this is waaay too confusing.
4,Get A Grip!!!,"Yes the book is biased, as is the Daily show itself. Who cares!!! If you are serious about your education concerning politics and being an informed voter this book should not be a part of your decision making process. It is a slap at American Democracy. It is meant to be entertaining not educating. As was mentioned in other reviews, if you are looking to learn about the American political system from this book, you need to think again and start with a basic civics text from high school. As it is often said the best form of flattery is when you appear on Saturday Night Live. In this case it is the mocking of a system, that despite it not being perfect, has and continues to work. I too am turned off by the liberal bias of the book and show, but I still find them to be good for a laugh."
2,A little bit of Humor,"I gave this two starts because, honestly, it has very little value. It's not very funny at all, and humor is all that it is supposed to be. Sorry Mr. Stuart."
2,Not that impressed.,"I like Stewart's show but not this book. I didn't even finish it which is a rarity for me. The best comparison I can make is to a juiced-up ""Mad Magazine"" and I outgrew those years ago.Pretty inane."
1,Confusion and regression,"In Jon Stewart's ""Kierkegaard's Relations to Hegel Reconsidered"" we are introduced to a stunning expose on Modern European Philosophy. The study of Kierkegaard's supposed anti-Hegel stance is turned upside-down and the reader is left exploring the idea that the two were quite in agreement.This new book seems to be a step backwards."
1,Crude,"Too much of this book is analagous to a third-rate stand-up comic who can't get laughs the old-fashioned way (by being funny), so instead resorts to crude sex jokes that are supposed to be funny because they use words we don't use in polite conversation. Get over it. We stopped speaking like that in sixth grade."
1,IS HIS FIVE MINUTES OVER YET?,"The book was an interesting read at first, but quickly became boring and predictable."
5,An army general tells President Bush 3 Brazilian soldiers have died...,"...and he starts crying. Bawling really. The general is not used to this kind of a breakdown from the Commander-in-Chief and he asks Bush, with some alarm, ""What's the matter, sir? It's only 3 Brazilian soldiers."" Bush sobers up for a moment, and then asks him, on the verge of more tears, ""How many billion is that?"""
4,Just like the TV Show,"I love the Daily Show and so I decided to get the book by the very same people responsible for giving us our nightly dose of political satire. It's certainly funny and engaging. What makes it even funnier is the notes left by an actual professor who went through the book, line by line. His comments/criticism/observations are hilarious. It made the book so much more enjoyable. So basically if you like the TV Show, you'll definitely like this book."
4,Good Book!,even though this book is about 6 years old it still gets me thinking about government policies and how our nation could if people would take a look and occasionally a risk to get new bills passed and such.
5,Trivial and Factual Fun,Jon Stewart and his writers compiled a very humorous and mostly factual book. I learned and laughed at the same time.
4,A very funny book,"I haven't been laughing so hard while reading since ""Byte Me!"" a few years ago. I just couldn't put it down. If it wasn't for the foul language used in this book I would've given it 5 stars. For those people who had given it only 1 star: If you wanna a good laugh, buy this book. If you wanna study real history, buy a real history textbook. Please don't complain because you bought the wrong product."
4,"Funny, but thank God for the editing","As you would expect from any Daily Show creation, lots of funny bits, but you can't deny that you are reading about history so it will get boring at some points, but then there are so many other visual distractions. Infact too many. The flow of the book is completey disrupted by the mindless, yet amusing distractions. All in all, a great bathroom read!"
5,Here It Is Good Citizens. A Very Funny Book!,"Jon Stewart and The Daily Show staff have collaborated to create a very humorous book discussing American Civics and the political processes that forged it. Starting with the framers of our Constitution, and then leading to the exploits and new vernacular of our President, the Daily Show staffers filled in the gaps with guffawing and knee slapping examples of U.S. Supreme Court faux pas and the status and responsbility of the media in our modern life, among many other ""targets."" Although much of the commentary concerns actual political incidents, be forewarned that the text is not always historically accurate and alot of lampooning is at hand. Regardless, the book is a ""hoot"" to read. I rate the text at five stars for a very entertaining diversion from the mundane life! Enjoy."
5,Medicine for the Huddled Masses,"This book is a welcome return to sharp and clever political satire . After diving into it over a weekend, it became apparent to me that a great deal of effort went into the design and content of this faux-textbook. The most amusing aspects of the book may be the minute footnotes and sidebars that the hastiest of readers may overlook the first time through. Perhaps the most caustic section is Chapter 7, which bites into the evolution of mass media and what it has now become. It sends a clear message to the commercial news outlets: We're laughing at you, not with you.Everyone is satirized at some point in the book; even some of the readers, I suppose. Whomever the target, it is important to remember that satire only works when the portrayal is based in reality. This book is very effective in that regard, and it should give the targets cause to reflect (if they would only listen). Given the hours of hearty chuckles it provides, America (The Book) is a hardcover bargain."
4,Entertaining and informative,"This book provides a very funny and usually quite informative look at our country (one truer than it pretends to be), smartly satirizing our nation's history, government and present state, not to mention the rest of the world and the textbook itself. If you've seen The Daily Show, you know what type of humor to expect - informed satire and absurdity that is humble and self-effacing enough to throw in a dick joke at just the right moment. True enough, there were more than a few less than laugh out loud moments and a modicum of tedium, but the book's clever and colorful graphic design, a parody of a middle or high school textbook complete with charts, graphs and hilarious subsections by people like Samantha Bee and Stephen Colbert, more than make up for them."
4,Very Funny Homage to the Onion,"This book is a very funny satire on the history, present and (hilariously) the future of politics. If you've read the onion and like politically incorrect humor and satire, this is the book for you."
4,"Laughed So Hard It Made Me Pee In My Pants!!!,","This book is a take on our government in all of its forms.Even if you don't get the Comedy Central cable channel and watch the ""Daily Show"", you can still enjoy this book for its shamelessly funny but sadly accurate observations of our government at work. I've found myself smiling and laughing out loud through entire chapters.The text is clever, thought provoking and absolutely hilarious! I even stopped drinking coffee after he mentioned a delicious coffee substitute called soyfee on his show. Its made from soybeans and you brew like coffee. I found it at my health food store but its also available at www.soycoffee.com. This book is a must read for every American or anyone who loves a good laugh."
5,Attention to detail.,"Given the outrageous lovefest that the media and much of the public has been showering on the Daily Show it would have been easy for the program to capitalize on the opportunity to make a quick buck by churning out an easy retread of what they already do on TV. Instead they dove into building, from scratch, a hilariously meticulous parody of a history/civics textbook, right down to the inconvenient but amusingly accurate binding. Projects like this make you realize how lazy most other people in the comedy business are."
5,"Too funny, and you might actually learn something","John Stewart reviews the history and political structure of the United States in a way that is extremely funny, and at times painfully true. You could learn something from this book, at least it is an excellent way to get interested in the history of this country. Ideal to get young people involved in the issues facing our country right now, as well as interested in our past.Some may find it irreverent, but taken in the spirit that it was meant, it becomes obvious that John Stewart loves this country and knows we can do better."
4,A very funny book,"Jon Stewart, of The Daily Show fame, has written a very funny book that might also teach you something about the way our government works. However, some readers may be offended by some of the crude language used throughout the book."
3,Too contrived,"The book has its moments , but overall the humor is too contrived. The jokes are obvious and predictable. I think the writers at The Onion do a much better job of political satire/humour. You should read ""Our Dumb Century"" which is far more humorous and insightful."
4,History with humor,"We've all sat through history class in school discussing our nations constitution and thought it was the most boring subject. Enter Jon Stewart. He's scaled down the information to the basics, and presents it in such a way to make it humorous. You will be able to follow the timeline and smile at some of the Ben Franklin references.This is a no high brow, down to basics history lession. It's a good introduction to US history to school aged kids, or anyone who is interested in a little history with humor."
5,great book,this book will keep you entertained for hours and bring you up to date on thousands of years of political mayhem in the process (even if it is mostly ridiculous or false). make sure that you're reading it somewhere that you can laugh out loud!
2,disappointed alley,"This is the worse book ever concieved. It never brought a smile, forget laughter."
4,"Laughed So Hard It Made Me Pee In My Pants!!!,","This book is a take on our government in all of its forms.Even if you don't get the Comedy Central cable channel and watch the ""Daily Show"", you can still enjoy this book for its shamelessly funny but sadly accurate observations of our government at work. I've found myself smiling and laughing out loud through entire chapters.The text is clever, thought provoking and absolutely hilarious! I even stopped drinking coffee after he mentioned a delicious coffee substitute called soyfe e on his show. Its made from soybeans and you brew like coffee. I found it at my health food store but its also available at www.soycoffee.co m. This book is a must read for every American or anyone who loves a good laugh."
5,"And now, your moment of zen!","Jon Stewart and the Daily Show writers have truly written a masterpiece more interesting, and at times more educational, than any textbook I pay $150 bucks for in college! While I'm admittedly a big Democrat, this book makes fun of both parties (and the smaller parties) on an equal level. Sure, there are a lot of Bush jokes, but Kerry gets some and so do seemingly every other big political figure. This book was so entertaining that I read it front to back in one try, though it's just as fun to read small parts at a time."
4,Shamelessly funny but sadly accurate,"This book is a take on our government in all of its forms.Even if you don't get the Comedy Central cable channel and watch the ""Daily Show"", you can still enjoy this book for its shamelessly funny but sadly accurate observations of our government at work. I've found myself smiling and laughing out loud through entire chapters.The text is clever, thought provoking and absolutely hilarious! I even stopped drinking coffee after he mentioned a delicious coffee substitute on his show. Its made from soybeans and you brew like coffee. I found it at my health food store but its also available at ww.soycoffee.co m. This book is a must read for every American or anyone who loves a good laugh."
3,"Humerous, but not worth the money","This book is entertaining, but that's all. I picked it up at the store and read most of it. It has some funny spots, but really, there are better ways to spend your money.On the whole, not a book worth buying"
2,Disappointed,I love Jon Stewart - on the Daily Show. After I received this book I eagerly opened it up and started reading and realized this was not a book I would have bought from an actual bookstore. A quick look was all I needed to realize there was too much tongue in cheek and Mr. Stewart should stick to television.
1,Audio CD Version is ABRIDGED???,"The Audio CD version was abridged by someone who decided which portions of this book I should hear and which I should not.I graduated from the ""Condensed Books"" school of literature long before I got out of grade school.If Jon Stewart is unable to get his book published on an unabridged CD, it's no sale for me."
3,Can we please leave the nudie pix out of the next book?,"If you fancy Stewart's nightly satirical rants, then you'll have an appreciation for this book. Otherwise, stay away...far, far away. Stewart's amusing to a point, but does not know where the line is drawn sometimes. Whose naked headless bodies were those anyway?"
1,Book was not funny,"This book was a waste of money in my opinion. If you are going to buy it, buy it used. Don't pay full price, its not worth it."
1,"Ho hum, the humor's dumb!","Jeese, I'm just glad I picked this one up at a yard sale for a few pennies! If I had actually spent my hard earned money on this garbage I'd have been upset enough to...to...to...oh well, this is pure trash its not funny and I think its actually dumbed me down! People, be careful what you read!"
2,whatever,"Like the Daily Show, this book is about as funny as a third-rate network sitcom on Tuesday nights."
1,In poor taste !,"This book is just stupid. I'm a former history teacher and although some of this book is researched and some is accurate, it's obnoxious, idiotic, and in poor taste. I mean really if you have to superimpose naked aged bodies onto the faces of supreme court justices to get a laugh don't you think it's time to retire? Whether you agree with the justices or not, they're accomplished and need to be treated with respect. This book is shameful and in poor taste. I wouldn't let your kids look at it, wouldn't put in school libraries, and wouldn't recommend it. Learn some manners!"
1,Piece of Garbage,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. What a waste of expensive paper and binding. Notice it's deeply discounted -- there's a reason.
5,Fantastic and Funny,"First off, in response to this comment by the reviewer who gave this one star ""Am I the only young American who doesn't feel Jon Stewart is funny?""... yes... yes you are. Ok, I suppose maybe Rush Limbaugh is similarly unimpressed. Anyhow, this is one hell of a book. If you have even a touch of cynicism (and in this day and age I hope you do), this book is delightful. If you have more than a touch, it's even better. Most of all, it's a very well written, and well conceived book that makes some excellent points in a fashion that people might (hopefully) be able to retain and comprehend."
5,Get out and vote,"Regardless of your party affiliation, if you've got a sense of humor, you'll find this book funny.I've kept it out for our teenagers to read, since most of them have at least heard of Jon Stewart. Has it produced any sort of political interest in them? Hard to say, but it at least keeps some of their attention focused on the bigger picture. Some of their friends have read it, so that makes it ""cool"" too.Bottom line, think about buying the book. But make sure above all else, you get out and vote!"
4,"Great, but too short","This book is the kind of funny irreverent humor you'd expect from the writers of the Daily Show, however, it is all too brief. The book's girth is deceiving. So, my only objection is that for the price and size, I wanted more! You may have this reaction too, so be forewarned. I finished the book so quickly I felt a little cheated, having expected hours of uproarious laughter. More like an hour."
5,High school history: revised by The Daily Show,"I think that I learned more about the way that our country REALLY works from this book than I learned in all my education. Jon Stewart and his cohorts know how to make Canada seem funny, the United States seem comical and the rest of the world seem... well this is a book about America so they kind of leave out a lot of other countries."
3,A bit juvenile....,It's a bit juvenile but that's a kind of what I'd expected from John Stewart. I know he's got better stuff in his head than this. If you're looking for good political books I'd suggest Bill Maher's books though. Keep this for your backup on those long drives though. :-)
5,This is the best textbook ever!,"This book is so amazing. Informative, funny, and i even learned some stuff about Canada. Great book for anyone who likes politics and/or history. The forward by Thomas Jefferson is good too."
5,Words cannot express the sheer genius contained in this book,"Genius. Absolute genius. Just holding the book is the equivalent of finding supreme happiness. There's is only one thing wrong with the book: I have to wash my hands before I begin reading each time, for I am unworthy of touching such a sacred manuscipt with my unholiest of hands. Read it! You'll never laugh so hard in your life!"
5,Funniest book I've read in years,"Hilarious! I've been reading this book and giggling all weekend long. It's presented in a format you'll remember from your high school history text books with little ""Did you know?"" tid bits in the margins, snappy charts/graphs/time lines and such. The Daily Show writers have done themselves proud with this effort - it's one of the funniest things I've read in many years. If you find the Daily Show even remotely amusing, you'll love this book."
5,A lesson in history,"Why should we not laugh at our predecessors? We laugh at our elected officials now. So what's wrong with laughing at previous undoings... and at the same time learning about our history and the fact that all of us are human and prone to make mistakes.And some of the barbs and shots reveal some very strange truths about our politicians and their ""democracy"". Hah!"
5,Where was this book when I took American History?,"This book is full of a general history of democracy and the politics of America. I was not a very good student of history when I was in school. This book really makes me wonder what I missed. There are intriguing and humorous insights in to Democracy and American politics on every page of the book. I had a hard time reading it because I wanted to stop and share all of this highly entertaining and educational material.As an American I have become disillusioned with the politics in my country, and I hope that our politicians can take this book and use it as a basis for cutting out the crap and really governing in our best interest.If you are looking for a great holiday gift for your teenaged child, then this would be it."
4,Not as Funny as the Show,"Enjoyable romp through the American political system -- which certainly lends itself to ridicule. There are many ingenious observations, and the book is well laid out. But in the end it's a bit too hectic for reading continuously, and some of it is even rather obvious. This book may be just too much of a good thing."
5,Should be in every classroom,"Penetrating and sublime comedy, mixed with incisive social commentary...from one of the funniest humans on the planet. I NEVER miss the Daily Show, nor the Colbert Report, and this kills in the same go-for-broke, visceral, wise-ass style."
4,Ah America!,"I wish people would review the content of the BOOK and not vent their political beliefs. ""Jon Stewart Presents America,"" is talented, smart, and very funny. Even if you don't agree with all of Stewart's opinions you have to admire this clever writer for getting his views across in a very witty and engaging way. It's a great book for anyone interested in exploring all different viewpoints--even if the book's opinions don't match your own. Stewart reaches an audience who normally doesn't pay any attention to contemporary issues and he sparks lively debate from both sides. And that's a good thing!"
2,Not very funny,The set up for the jokes are just too long for a not satisfying endOnly worth it if it's on sale for like 5 bucksIt's just not so funny
5,Nobody does it better,"Between this book and ""The Daily Show"", I may just get through the next four years."
4,Fan of TV Show,"If you tune in to the Jon Stewart Show, you will enjoy this book. It's candid, funny and well written. Fans of Stewart will not be disappointed. I also liked American Soldier by Tommy Franks."
5,"Hi-larious (and good for you, too!)","This book is genius. Jon Stewart, you very funny man. (Also, a shout out to Samantha Bee! ) Can't wait to read Mo Rocca's book next."
4,America (the book),"America (the book) is probably the most valuable textbook you'll ever encounter. Honest, quirky, and oh so sarcastic, this was a guaranteed winner and Jon Stewart knew it. Penned by the perfect person for the job, you'll learn more from this textbook than any other government book you'll have to read in school. While it gets a little dense and, well, textbook-like at some points, and utterly crude (crossing the line more than once to 'disgusting') at others, it's a great book, one that people who love to mock this democratic government of ours will absolutely LOVE.Rating: 4/5"
4,A book that will crack you up,"As everyone knows, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart is one of the funniest programs on TV. It always leaves me rolling on the floor laughing. The program's mix of news and satire is perfectly balanced. I like the show so much that I bought the book.This book has a lot of funny things in it. I think it might be the only publication in the world to have nude photos of the Supreme Court justices (obviously digitally manipulated). The only reason that I give this book four stars instead of five is that without Jon Stewart to deliver the lines, it loses a little bit of its magic. With Jon Stewart delivering the lines, I would give this five stars."
5,laughed out loud --- A LOT!,I laughed so much reading this book -- my wife kept telling me to keep it down! This book is fun and interesting. I highly recommend.
3,"some amusing bits, gets old quickly","Don't pay retail, don't buy the hardback.This started out as a fun read, but the fake text book ""schtick"" got old quickly & some of the bits were simply not funny."
5,What Stewart Doesn't Get ...,"Is that in text book form, even the funniest bits make me sleepy. It's like some Pavlovian reaction that harkens me back to high school when my forest-green levi's cords were just a little snug and my kelly-green izod shirt was a hand-me-down from my brother when everyone else was wearing Polo and the sun was shining directly on me, making me very warm and clammy.I further suggest he put his next book into some kind of cool hip-hop song/jingle featuring a sample from an '80s mega-hit -- perhaps Patty Smythe's ""The Warrior"" -- that way I'd pay attention. Because for my money a combination of Patty Smythe, Jon Stewart and hip-hop would crossover a lot of demongraphics -- especially to those who aren't bred to enjoy books."
3,it's ok,If you enjoy reading textooks then this will be your new favorite book. The funny parts are truly funny but the rest of it is a snore.
3,OK if you don't have the book,"I read America The Book and now the calendar has lost its appeal. I thought it would have different material, but it only includes small extracts from the book. If you don't have the book and are not planning to read it, this is funny stuff. Otherwise, I would skip it."
3,Wife made me buy it.. it's never been opened.,"I bought this because we love Jon Stewart. My wife really wanted to read it, but she's yet to even open it. It's sitting on a book shelf collecting dust. My wife owes me what I paid for it, damn her!"
1,Oh how clever!,"I'm not gonna read all 650+ reviews, but, did anyone catch the title of the book?America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction.Websters defines word [inaction] as: ""a LACK of action or activity"". Was anyone here dumb enough to think that was simply a typographical error?"
1,A Joke on the Book Buying Public!,"I ordered this book because it came so highly recommended, but boy was it a joke on me! I just wish I could give a minus rating to this singularly unfunny book laced with ""potty mouth"" humor that might appeal to pre-pubescent boys! What a yawn! Yes, I'm a senior citizen, who is bored with such childish drivel, so I asked my four middle-aged offspring to check it out and see if I'm just too particular. All opinions were that it is silly, ridiculous, and worst of all, a waste of paper and ink. Appropriately, it has been consigned to the Sacramento garbage landfill."
2,its decent to assault you father with,"Welp, I love The Daily Show, but whatever I expected to find in this book I sure didn't find"
2,"Some funny content, but has a liberal bias.","This book is very much like the Dailly Show itself. It can be very funny at times, but is also can be very biased in the perspectives expressed. If you have a liberal bias you may enjoy the book, but if you have a conservative bias you may view the book as liberal propaganda."
2,Not for the literarily-minded,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that political leaders deceive. The current administration is given to this trend of deception, as this book by pundit Ed Helms rightly points out. Systematically. And with charts.The oft-cited diagram of nude supreme court justices is generally considered to be the ""emotional core"" of this politically-charged text. But I'd be remiss not to point out, however, that it is when we see the entrance of Mr. Darcy into the action that we begin to understand the complexity of America, when we understand that Lizzy, in all of her red-white-and-blue trappings, experiences a desire both wholly human and also doomed, and that no one, whether it be Dick Cheney or Mrs. Bennet, can change that. On second thought, this book should get five stars. Viva la show du jour! Viva Mr. Darcy! Go Panthers!"
4,OVER ALL!!!,I am not sure about the point of the book? What is funny in TV does not necessarily be funny in print.
4,Hilarious,"What can I say, except that this book had me laughing the whole time I was reading it. Not only is it completely unbiased and politically neutral, it makes fun of literally everyone in politics. Even in its humor, what it describes is often too accurate in portraying issues of civics, which usually are very boring in nature. Very funny book."
5,Major Mistake in Book,"This book became my Bible of Politics until I saw on Page 128 chapter six the sequence of a butterfly's life. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.Perhaps Bush, being the non-environmentalist that he is might get this wrong, but Thomas Jefferson (editor) certainly should have known the sequence of metamorphos of the butterfly.....I am not so sure John would since he is definetly a 'city slicker'."
4,Is nothing sacred?,"No? Good! Jon Stewart and his merry band of idiots lampoon all things political. As another reviewer commented, the jabs at Jefferson's experiences are hysterical.The visual style keeps the presentation interesting from one page to the next and the photos help sell the concepts. Visually, it's not so much a book as it is a scrapbook/diorama (of sorts) and I think this would have done well as a pop-up book.One of the contributing writers is the frequently amusing, Stephen Colbert from Strangers with Candy. Jon has corralled a talented group of writers and I hope they put together another project in the future.While not all jokes hit their mark, this is a funny book! Thanks to the wife for this one."
2,Typical liberal rants,"Sure, this book looks like a harmless parody, but closer inspection reveals that it's just another example of how leftist ""The Daily Show"" has become. Just more Republican-bashing that we've grown to expect from Stewart and company. I gave it two stars for the colors and design. The content will most likely amuse the democrats."
1,Entertainment for the political left,"As another reviewer wrote -- you'll enjoy this book if you agree with Jon Stewart's politics; if you don't, you won't. That's about all that needs to be said. With Stewart finally coming out of the closet as a rabid Republican-hater, I suspect his fanbase will be reduced to a lefty monoculture pretty quickly. His studio audiences are already pretty much entirely left-wing.Once again, Amazon has trumpeted the virtues of a left-wing book while giving the usual chilly reception to books written for audiences on the other side of the aisle. Amazon customers might want to consider this when making purchasing decisions."
3,Pretty tame,"This one felt slapped together, as if a bunch of TV writers decided to come up with a book. I found some of it funny, sure, but I also had to wade through a lot of text that was much less interesting to me. My overall impression is that this is more of a marketing feat than a real book--this wasn't an author deciding to write something that was in his heart, but a product assembled to take advantage of the show's popularity. There are books by real humorists out there--this is a compilation by a bunch of people you've never heard of."
2,Ehh was ok,Would probably never have read this book if it wasn't for the controversy. Best to read at a book store than decide to buy or not.
2,overrated,"I love the show, but this book is not nearly as funny, nor is it instructive, nor seriously critical about anything of or in the history. Fails to deliver on all counts."
1,Wrong from the just from the title,"The US form of Government is NOT a DEMOCRACY, never was, never was supposed to be! Our Founding fathers were dead against any form of Democracy, that's why they formed a Republic which is rule by law. A Democracy is rule by men, big difference! The word ""Democracy does not appear anywhere in the Constitution, which formed our government. Tha The pledge to the flag says ""for the Republic for which it stands"" because we are a Republic, NOT a Democracy."
4,Entertainment for Liberals.......,"Jon Stewart is funny and always has been, but this book plays strictly to the Liberal crowd. Any references to Dems have been (obviously) placed strictly to feign ""balance"". Much like (anything)Michael Moore does gets Liberals salivating (regardless of accuracy), this will be treated as a reference book, under the veil of comedy. Overall, this is an entertaining book, but I had hoped for a little more."
1,I don't get it,"I've watched Jon Stewart on TV and liked his sense of humor. As a result, I ordered this book--top of the best seller list, highly recommended. And what did I receive? Sophomoric tripe. Not even that. Puerile claptrap. It's really that bad. Did I lose my sense of humor when Dubya retained the White House? Or have others hypnotized themselves somehow into thinking this book is actually amusing? I don't know. All I know is that I didn't laugh once with this book. Not once."
1,Sophomoric Humor,I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping for witty and instead found it to be mostly juvenile name calling.
5,fun to read,"This book is funny and informative. What I especially like is that it is not mean-spirited or nasty, even to those public figures it lambasts. It's good, unpretentious fun with the kind of wit that makes politics fun to read about."
4,"Good, but flawed...","President Bush really should read this book. I fear some of it would go right over his head, but still...I laughed out loud for the first time on page viii, and pretty much every third page after that, but by page 25 I'd noted a serious flaw: most of the jokes aren't funny unless you have a postgraduate degree in history and/or have read stuff by old dead Greek guys. None of the people I grew up with would find this book amusing, which is a shame because they're precisely the ones who should be reading it.I'm a big fan of Jon Stewart, and I'm no prude, but I found the frequent use of the 'f-word' more gratuitous than funny, and the first 'aside' by Rob Corddry was just offensive.That being said, the book is well worth the time. If I were a college prof, this book would be a required text for my class in American history or government."
3,Funny John Stewart,"I like the Jon Stewart show immensely and this book is a good primer on the humor of our ""democracy inaction"". I'm giving this book and Lloyd Dangle's newly released book ""Troubletown Told You So: Comics That Could've Saved Us From This Mess"" to all my relatives this year. And frankly both these books should be taught in college government classes!Troubletown Told You So: Comics that Could've Saved Us from this Mess"
5,Hey Mum!!!,"I received this gift for Christmas(thanks mum!), but found in my mum's review she called me a republican(no thanks mum!). I very much enjoy the book. I wanted it because I have been completely feed up with the current state of politics in this country. This book puts the flaws of American politics and history to humour, the best known remedy for idiotic, moronic times."
3,"America, the book","As with the previous book, Earth, the book, Jon Stewart seems to have done it again. A very well-written irrelevant book for anyone who enjoys the humor of Jon Stewart. I definitely would recommend this book."
5,Worth your money,"This book is not only a great referencial (word?) tool, it's also a hilarious read. I reccomend this to students (of age) and teacher's alike, plus people like me who aren't either. Brilliant!"
4,The Melody Kid Rides again,"Jimmy Wakely was one of those Saturday Matinee Singing Cowboys from the 1940's. While not as well known as Gene Autry Jimmy Wakely certainly could sing. This is a good collection of some of his hits (plus some covers of other songs better known by other artists) plus a few well done duets with his sometime singing partner Margaret Whiting. Yes there are Cowboy songs, love songs and sacred songs to show that Jimmy had a pleasant voice that was able to cross several musical genres. A few ordinary tunes fill out this CD, but on the whole its well worth your time to buy it."
3,"Wonderful Music, but Be Forewarned!","I can't say enough about Reich's 'Variations for Winds, Strings & Keyboards.' Although Reich himself found the piece a disappointment owing to the muddiness of controlling a large orchestra with percussive precision, I have always loved the piece for that exact quality. The sound-field is massive, and one has the sense of moving over an immense landscape; the murky ambience simply lends a greater mass and mystery to this beautiful piece. For fans of Reich's 'Music for 18 Musicians' and 'Music for a Large Ensemble', it is simply indispensible.So when I saw that it had been remastered for this release, I eagerly bought it - only to find that it was only Adams' Shaker Loops that was remastered! It was, I thought, unfairly packaged to make it seem that the whole recording was remastered. If you already own the original CD, don't bother with this reissue. Those who do not own it yet have a real treat in store."
1,Could have been better,Gateways What Lay Beyond was a great disappointment as was the entire series. The individual novels were only loosely connected. Most people probably thought that this last book was going to draw the stories together in a grand finale. That it didnt do. The Challenger segment was at least related to what transpired in the novel as was the TNG story which was the best of the short stories here. The New Frontier story had absolutely nothing to do with the novel or the Gateways and could have easily been left out. Keith DeCandido's DS9 short story though well written didnt have the least thing to do with his DS9 novel nor the Gateways. Kira fans would like it. The Voyager story explains rather poorly the orgin of the Gateways. The TOS story is just about as weak as the novel but at least it dealt with the story that was set up in the novel. I did enjoy the Pocket Novel Timeline in the back of the book but then I am a bit prejudiced because I helped to construct it.
1,Extremley disapointed,I was disapointed with this book. The writing was poor in many places. I have read better on free fanfiction sites. Most of the stories I could not even finish due to their poor quality. Very few of the stories were actually written at a halfway acceptable level. Buying this book was a waste of time and money.
2,not worth the money,"This book was a serious disappointment. Previous reviewers have touched on many of the shortfalls but let me add that each of these stories is only around 40 pages long. We don't get a conclusion to the gateways series we get a summary ending. If you must read it, check the book out from the library or wait for the paperback."
2,Janice's Disappointment,"I've read almost every book in the Star Trek series and seen most of the shows throughout the history of Trekkies. This book was a total disappointment. Plot lines were just left without continuity in each of the sections of the novel. I actually put down the book without finishing it!I realize it becomes harder and harder to come up with plot lines, but the authors blew this one. The series leads the reader up to a climax in each of the books, but I feel empty since there is no ending in the final Gateways book."
2,A cheap shot by the publisher,"I gave this book a low mark not because of the stories, but because of the format and that this is a cheap trick to sell an extra book.This is the 7th of a set - not a series, but a set - of books about the Ionian-built gateways. I have not problems with the actual stories. They are good, well-written, Star Trek fare, spanning all televised series and the later book series that developed.What really ticks me off is that none of the stories are complete. They are all continued and reach their conclusions in separate sections of this book. So what this book is is the final chapters of 6 other books.This book does not stand alone in any way, nor does it tie the other stories together. Why not just conclude each book in the set as it was written!If you have read any of volumes 1-6 of this set you will need to read this one to find out how it ends.I would buy it used or check it out from the library, though, just to send the publisher a message."
2,The multi part series books gimmick has run dry......,This book presents six endings to the six paperback novels and it has driven me away from purchaseing a Star Trek novel ever again. The series editor should have a better motive than part the fans with their money. I have to truly say as one reviewer said ...never again.
