5,Low-priced MSG,"This is quite a bargain when you compare the price to the small cannisters of Accent in the stores. It seems perfectly comparable with Accent. I use it, however, on my dogs' food. It keeps them from eating each other's droppings by making them untasty (as if those weren't untasty to begin with, but not to a dog). Since I sprinkle MSG on their food daily, this product is quite a savings for me (and the vet is the one who endorses use of MSG for this purpose)."
2,The Dance Moves are Fine but...,"The steps are simple to learn, and the choreography kept my interest, however, the video was too obnoxious to tolerate because each exercise started with Johnny saying, ""Are we ready?"" and then the exercisers would say along with him ""One, two, let's La-tin-va!"" or something to that effect. Also, once you have the moves down (after doing the exercises two times through) the instruction and annoying cheer are no longer needed. There should be an option to go directly to the workout and skip the instruction that unfortunately accompanies every segment."
2,Good shoe - but poor insole.,"I have been using this for couple of weeks. The shoe looks good andwell built. I like the grip. But the insole peels off - exposing the foamand it messes up the socks. Good shoe - but poor insole.Update : Sep 2008.Bad Choice. After two months of use, I see an 3/4 inch tear on thefront right side of my right shoe. It is next to the stitches but notthe stitch itself. I'm not buying this again.Amazon : Is there a way to let the manufacturer know about this comment ?"
5,Delawareness,"If you are interested in the music of young Americans reacting to the thrill of the Beatles, you will love this CD. Surprisingly well recorded, sung soulfully, with lyrics that belie the young ages of the band members. More than a cut above garage band in my book."
1,mixed up CD,"I got my order on time, as was promised,getting ready to loose myself in bluse, only to find the C D in side was not what I bought.I was thinking of buying more C Ds,but you loose, you can fool me just once."
4,Eye opening,"Good content and very informative, spiritual & entertaining but a little thin for the price. Could of been bigger with all the information to work with. Jesus real life story was great."
5,Introduction to Urantia Revelation,"This is the best so far that I have seen written in a ""Readers Digest"" format of the Urantia papers. If you have a thirst of knowledge on what makes our universe tick, than this is the starter book for you."
2,Just buy the Urantia book,For a couple of dollars more just buy the Urantia book. In this book you will mostly find quotes straight out of the Urantia book. I read the Urantia book first and then ordered this book. I guess I expected more insight. The Urantia book on the other hand is the most beautiful book I've ever read. Get the leather bound so it will not fall apart when you read it for the 3rd time.
2,DONT PANIC!,"Remember Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy? the actual book had in bold letters across the front of it "" Don't Panic!"" Well, if the Urantia book was the Hitchikers Guide, then this would be the ""Don't Panic.""Tolerantly written, giving small glimpses into the myriad world of the Urantia Book it operates like a fleshed out outline one would use to cram for a test. And being there is no limit to mans utter assurance that he knows everything, it even includes a map of the universes, including the ones we have not formally discovered yet.I'll be honest, when I was searching for something to believe in after my fall from Christianity, I looked into the Urantia book. Moved on."
5,Some real gems,"ABBA did come up with some real gems .They are well presented on the ABBA LIVE album.I loved the child choir joining in in I Have A Dream and Fernando-two of my favourites.Other favourites are the uplifting Chiqitita , Take a Chance On Me , Super Trouper and Money Money Money.Definitely a brilliant introduction or retro for the best of ABBA."
3,never cared much for this one,"abba's production techniques (endless vocal overdubs) left some doubt as to whether the lead vocalists can actually sing. this album proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that our nordic divas CAN sing.""live"" however suffers from the choice of material.much of the songs are from their wembley arena gig in 1979 with a few takes from their 1981 appearance on U.S. TV (the dick cavett show) and at least 2 from their successful 1977 tour of australia. they weren't exactly active in the tour circuit, but they are not lacking in live material either. more live performances from australia or from japan could've been used in lieu of those takes from 1979's wembley tour where performances were bordering on the hurried and exhausted.one good reason to own this set however lies in the technical side. apart from superior sonics, the new 1997 remaster was re-edited to give this a ""seamless"" feel even though the tracks are from different sources and years."
3,For fans only,Being a true ABBA fan I have this CD. It is good to have the chance to hear different versions of their songs and to be able to get a taste of how they sounded live. They are good but like most other acts their studio recordings are far superior.
3,Worth Watching,"I would say that this movie is not worth staying home on a weekend to watch. The pace of the movie tends to run slow from time to time. However, if you have nothing else to do, this one is certainly worth watching.Probably, Embeth Davidtz and Thora Birch gave the best performances of the entire casts. Keira Knightley's fans should not be dissapointed though. While her performance is mediocre, she does show a little bit of herself in this one.Without giving away too much of the plot, the story centers around the lives of a group of priviledged teens in a private school. Left on their own, they lose self-control and reasonable judgment. All of that naturally leading to trouble and tragedy. This movie reminded of The Lord of the Flies in some ways.The actors cast in the roles of Mike and his best friend were obviously too old for the part. It was a bit of a stretch to make us believe that they are teens."
2,Shlock not Shock,"I will be the first person to tell you I do not like horrors on a general scale. But I braved this because of the fine actress Thora Birch is and that there was nothing else to do on a rainy Wednesday night. I was ready to hide behind the pillows, bite my lip and shred my fingernails. Instead, I found myself biting back the laughter.What could have been a brilliant ghost film with rampaging trapped soldiers trying to fight their way out turned out to be limp psychological nonsense with naughty Thora just doing it for the man she loves. Sound sound tense moments, but ultimately, it reminded me of 'The Good Son' on various levels and well...say no more. The drowning of the pretty geek boy - awurgh, dreadful. And the end 'smiling' shot with sensible pyschiatrist? A 'curses, foiled again' moment...If you want girls on the edge and you don't want to sleep at night, try 'Ginger Snaps'. I dare you to look out a darkened window after that!"
2,Not really that good,"If you are a real fan of suspense,horror,scary movies,this film does not fit the bill. I found it too slow moving and not very interesting. Maybe age makes a difference in whether or not youwill like this movie. If you haven't seen it yet,don't bother."
1,I am not the only one this was terrible,"I watched this movie with my wife, I expected a really great horror movie...my error. The first mistake, It wasn't a horror despite Amazon's grouping. The next was thinking it could be great.It's terrible, it's awful, and it's just a bore. The best part was it ending. I'm adding this review as so many people like to give a 'big word' review, and try and analyze this for a master piece of movie making.Gag! I just wasted 120 mins of my life!"
3,Better Than You'd Expect,"Surprisingly good movie -- Laurence Fox as always, is hot, and the cast is very strong, even Kiera Knightly, who manages to pull off a good performance with a minimum of her trademark grimacing. The story is engrossing, and keeps you in gritty suspense all the way through."
2,I didnt get into it that much but it's still an interesting watch. Birch is great,"Thora Birch (American Beauty, Ghost World) stars as Liz a girl who has escaped after going missing for a short period of time. The detective played by Embeth Davidtz (13 Ghosts, Army of Darkness) is on her case as she tries to fit the pieces and figure out what happened to Liz. Liz and 4 other get together and wind up being stuck in the woods. When of them stays out of The Hole they all eventually try to get out of there in one piece. There are 2 versions of the story told by two people and in each of them and in each it tells about what happened to the group of people. Thora Birch's performance along with a solid supporting cast including Desmond Harrington (Love Object, Wrong Turn) and Keira Knightley (Domino, King Arthur) with some good moments anchor this movie. I saw the ending coming. Also starring Laurence Fox (The Last Drop, Gosford Park) and Daniel Bracklebank (The Hours, Merlin)."
2,Impressed but not...,"I bought this DVD because of Kiera Knightly, I won't deny it. That said I was not expecting much. It still disappointed me.This film had some good story ideas, but it didn't deliver on any of them. The thriller aspect of it was less than thrilling and I found it to be anticlimatic.If you are a Kiera fan I guess its worth having for the collection or renting it. If not there is no point to buying or renting this DVD."
2,Directors Need to Ask for Directions,"***Possible SPOILERS ahead*** Tale of a group of spoiled-rich teenagers getting into a hole and having problems to getting out of it. It is composed of two movements: a short straight story that is really scary and is resolved by an ""act of god"", and a second very weak part which transforms one of the characters from an innocent nerd into a minor Kayzer Sosze. From the moment the second version of the story appears the script starts to tumble down the stairs until it get wrapped in muddy waters (literally). This `crazy-mastermind' part is unbelievable and is left unresolved with a wink to spectators that don't ask for much. I would let this pass and consider this film as a minor effective entertainment if not for the fact that the final scenes between the psychologist and the crazy student which reveals the truth are badly managed and fail to produce tension or lasting horror."
3,A NEW OLD TALE,"This movie was a refreshing new twist on an old tale. I have seen parts of this story before, but with this script and cast, it all seemed new. Desmond Harrington is obviously the next American superstar. I think he is at the same stage Tom Cruise was when he did ""The Outsiders"". I was totally mislead by who the director wanted us to believe was the cuprit. a beleivable surprise in this genre is always welcome. Without an overabundance of special effects and super serial killers, the raw acting is what made this movie very good. I give it a 3.5 rating. When the onscreen actors' emotions translate to the viewers emotions(STEEL MAGNOLIAS), then everyone has done their job well. This is not a new tale, it just seems lik it is."
3,Average with some redeeming parts,"Overall, this was a generally enjoyable, but not outstanding movie. Its set in modern day Britain at an elitish boarding high school. Break rolls around, and a group of 4 decides to hole up in a bomb shelter with the help of a 5th friend. In the beginning of the movie, one of the 4 emerges bloody and apparently the victim of something gone horribly wrong. She is then interviewed, and what follows are alternate accounts of what actually occurred. Again, the movie was average. As a suspense flick, there really wasn't that much suspense, and the events unfold without much pop and pizazz. The acting was generally good, and I was surprised to find an early Keria Knightly involved as well. Its certainly worth a watch, but just don't expect to be blown away."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though never released stateside, The Hole is a succesfully off-putting and claustrophobic tale that takes a nightmarish scenario to a fitting conclusion; while the story admittedly is never as good above ground as it is while in the ""Hole,"" overall it's a very engaging movie."
1,The only hole in this movie is the plot!,"I don't think i've ever seen a movie this bad! So bad, i was angry at myself for watching it. I think the only thing i've discovered by watching this movie, is that Thora Birch really annoys me! Go figure! Another clue to how bad this movie is, Keira Knightly is the main focus on the cover, implying she is the central figure of the movie (as if that would lure more people to see it) well, she wasn't. Sorry folks, the only thing your gonna get out of this is an expensive beer coaster. If you looking for suspense, don't go for this one. If your looking for gore, not here either, pretty minimal. No heart was put into this plot, you will only feel less intelligent for watching this tripe! NO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,zero stars if could.,"This film is a pile of (....)!!!!. Absolutely crap. It's boring, nothing happens, it has the same useless director as Godsend, the script is appauling, and frankly, the only thing it's good for is the bin.Quite possibly, the worst movie ever made."
2,Really Boring!!!,"When you look at the cover of this film you think it's gonna be great! It's not. Definitely not!!!Four private school students sneak off for a couple days to an underground World War 2 bunker. When the holiday ends though they find out that they've been locked inside the bunker with hardly no food, no water and no means of communication to the outside world. But one of them is deceiving the others and is to blame for all of this!The film is just . . . well . . . TOO ENGLISH!!! I'm from England and I think that it's so rubbish! Most of the actors playing British people are American which could be an explanation. American people always make British people sound really snobby when they try and do the accent! People say that somehow this film explains the mystery of The Blair Witch Project. I have no idea how?! Anyway personally I think it's completely rubbish and feels more like a BBC special length drama rather than a movie!"
3,A OK movie,"This movie was very good and it had a good storyline but they should have taken out all the swearing and some nudity. But in all, it was a good movie."
3,Eh...,"Thora Birch is amazing in ""The Hole"". This movie lacks something though. The story moves at a very slow pace and moments that are meant to shock are brushed off and expected. Many of the actors give amazing performances, and for that the movie should be watched. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you find it at a good price."
3,Going into the hole,"At the start of the film we see an exhausted zombie like Birch walking back on campus (after escaping the hole). She and 3 friends (looking for a fun place to party) got trapped in a WW2 bunker. But how did it happen? The movie takes us through 2 interesting versions of what happened.The hole features some talented unknown actors/actresses (except Knightly ofcourse, who is well known). The characters are interesting, and the music is very good too. However, the story is a little unbelievable, leaving some watchers with many ""why did they do that?"" questions. My advice is to not ask yourself ""why did she/he do that"". The characters do alot of things that don't make sense and you will enjoy the movie alot more if you just forget about the flaws.This isn't a bad movie, but you will enjoy it alot more if you have low expectations"
5,Borderline Five Stars,"This was borderline five stars, but I give it five if you like this genre. You're never really sure what reality is. The kind of movie that scares me is one that could actually happen. This is certainly one of those, although I slept fine that night. The only thing that I did NOT like was the opening part with the girl screaming into the phone -- too cheap and gimmicky (it could have been done better and less annoyingly). Otherwise, entertaining."
3,"Interesting, Dark Tale","Definitely worth watching once, perhaps owning if you are a fan of Keira or Thora. Put a few teenagers underground, lock 'em in, and watch the madness that ensues. I found myself rewinding to watch certain scenes over. Acting not bad, some funny parts. And yes, a dead, naked Kiera (in autopsy room). You may find yourself asking what you would have done differently in the same situation... and hoping you don't have to find out. I give it 3.5 stars, rounded to 3 for Amazon. Recommended for fans of dark cinema."
4,Good Book For Good Readers,There is good information and it really got me thinking of the great lakes. Most of the settings are in real places like Detroit and Niagara falls. But sometimes it didn't even talk about the main character.
5,Paddle to the Sea,I was suprised how fast the book was delivered.My boyfriend loved it! He said it was just as he had remembered it as a little boy.What a great Christmas gift. He thought I had spent a lot of money on it.Beautifully illustrated and in mint condition!
3,I think this book is great because I like all his adventures,This book is great because it tells a little about Native Americans and our class is learning about the Indians who lived on Long Island.
5,I stole this title for a magazine article...,"... for my [...] kayak adventure down the Yukon River as this book was such a boyhood dream!Thirty-five years later my daughter found a used copy of this classic for one of my yet-another-birthday presents.I cried, once again"
2,I think Paddle to the sea is a good book.,Paddle to the sea is a nice book.People who read it will enjoy it.Ice skateing through lake Huron. The forest fire and a sawmill scean. Jon Times
5,It is exciting.,"If you like to read I would recommend Paddle-To-the-Sea. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is a really exciting book. It has lots of adventures in it. The best parts about the book are the beginning, the middle, and the end. It has lots of great pictures in the book. But the best part is when he goes over Niagra Falls. It takes you where the book is. It makes you feel sad, mad, and even glad. If you can feel all those things in this book, you would love this book. It is really good I'm telling you. If you want to know more then get this great amazing book."
5,One of my all time favorites - a true classic,"As others here have said, this is a true keeper. A babysitter read it to me when I was 10, and I never forgot it. I bought and read it to my kids when they were around that age, and they wouldn't let me put them to sleep without reading at least one chapter. It's educational, beautifully illustrated, and a touching story. I may have to fight with my kids over who gets to read it first to their kids! A treasure."
5,So happy to find this after 35 years,"I read this book when I was a boy. I don't even know how I came to have it, but I was facinated by the drawings and story. It was one of the few books I really read from cover to cover. Now that I have 5 children of my own I thought I would look to see if I could find a used copy and was so happy to see it back in print. My children love it just as much as I did at their age."
5,A wonderful adventure for children and young adults,"This is a panoramic novel with beautiful and detailed illustrations by the author. It tells the story of a tiny canoe carved out of wood that makes a long journey through the rivers and lakes of the northland until it finally finds its way to the open sea. It makes the journey that the indian boy who made it cannot make. This is a moody, beautifully written book about the beauty and mystery of the natural world and the power of the imagination. One of the finest things ever written for children between about 8 and 15."
5,Great book to share with young readers.,"One of my best memories is reading this book with my daughter. Since we canoe alot, she remembers the book from years' past. Now we are now sending a copy to a friend, so that he can share it with his 6-year-old granddaughter."
3,Eye This,"Graham Nash released Innocent Eyes in 1986, it was his first solo album in six years. He clearly had been listening to the radio in that time because the album adopts a clear 80's synth beat that permeated most records at the time. The result is a fun, lively album that tanked on the charts but is a great listen. The title track is a bouncy number with Kenny Loggins providing the backing vocal. ""Chippin' Away"" is a nice slice of island music ala Jimmy Buffett that is about taking down the Berlin Wall which would happen not long after the song's release."
3,Not His best work,"I just love Graham Nash's music. He is modest and some of his best work is in his non-solo albums. This album came out when some MAX HEADROOM types started doing to music, what G Bush did to our country. It contains one of his best ever love ballads, Sad Eyes, and the title track and Glass and Steel are OK. The rest is NOT the Graham Nash we know."
2,disappointing,"After seeing the prior movie with the joker, this one was too predictable, felt too simple, rushed, and too much of the filiming was in the dark. I can't recommend it, wait for it to be free."
5,The Dark Knight Does Rise!,"I enjoyed watching this movie--have been looking forward to watching it since it first came out on the big screen. It did't fail me, it was very good, both Batman and Catwoman were excellent! I would highly recommend it!!!"
3,"Movie good, Amazon experience lacking","So I tried and tried to buy this from my tablet, but kept getting an error telling me I couldn't watch it on my tablet because I didn't have flash. I didn't want to watch it on my tablet, I wanted to watch it on my XBOX. Finally I got it to go through from my laptop, and started the movie on XBOX and guess what, DVD quality at best. Amazon, the extra features for PRIME is great, but get your technical crap down a little better will ya?"
4,Prett good,"A little preachy and not much batman, but a decent plot and the ending would surprise those not familiar with the comics."
4,good movie,"movie was a bit longer than initially anticipated but nevertheless a good movie. can't wait to watch all 3 back to back to back! come on robin, boy wonder, what can you bring to the crime-fighting table?"
5,Watchit/Buyit,Loved this movie. A perfect ending to the trilogy! I doubt there will be another movie in the series and it does leave some questions open but isn't that one of the factors of a good movie? It leaves you wondering.
3,Good movie but not HD quality,"Not much more to say, the movie is quite good but the quality of the video is not HD (720p or 1080p) it is more DVD like (480p). I have Verizon FIOS, therefore the speed of the Internet connection should not have anything to do with it."
3,Not as good as the others,The Dark Knight rises. It was a little confusing and the story line was lame this time. The same good actors however
3,"Entertaining, but doesn't deliver on the film legacy.","Entertaining, but does not live up to the quality and thoughtfulness of the preceding films in the series. Despite being almost 3 hours long, the pace often felt rushed, which deflated moments that were meant to be infused with emotion, and reduced the charm of purposefully corny comic book one-liners to seeming out of place and silly.Transitions were clunky, and the narrative lacked coherence, such that I was often not entirely clear about what had transpired in a given scene. Overall, a disappointment."
3,Ho-hum,"After all the hype, this did't live to expectaions. While it was a good flick, I was expecting much more."
3,great except for stolen ending,"I loved the movie, but did they mean to steal the ending from Black Sunday? Is it meant to be an homage to John Frankenheimer?"
1,Awful,"I didn't expect DKR to be very good, based on the previous two Chris Nolan entries, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. Pretentious, self-important, and downright laughable at times. It's a shame, because I've long thought that the Batman series needed to take a darker and more violent approach to its story telling. But this is not the right formula. Skip it."
2,BATMAN : THE DARK KNIGHT RISES,I find myself disappointed with this one. Since when does Batman want to quit being Batman. I know Christian Bale was tired of doing Batman and so is Nolan and they reflected it with the story in the movie. Anne Hathaway as CATWOMAN was pure Brilliance.For me she saved the movie. She nailed Catwoman perfectly. Tom Hardy as Bane was another excellent choice. His back story was also better than the comic back story. They dropped the ball with Talia AL Ghul big time. I enjoyed Gordon Levitt's character alot. Heck he did more detective work than Batman. Overall I gave this one a two star rating because Nolan dropped the ball on Batman. I have hopes that the next one will be a True Batman movie.
1,boring,"I give this one star in comparison to the other 2 Batman Movies. The plot was dull, and there were not enough action scenes. Bane is more annoying than evil."
2,Poor execution of a perfect concept -,"The basis for the film is truthful and desperately needed in our time - socialism destroys - big government is death - power in the hands of elitists is ruinous - class warfare destroys - but the production of the ideas is tedious, often inane, and overdone by repetition. The hero journey is always relevant and the incorporation of how Robin joins the team and the establishment of the continuation of the journey well thoughtout, but this film should not be the end but the beginning of the rise of good and the reestablishment of order."
1,Bad Digital Copy,"This is only a review on the Digital Copy ... the movie itself was a 4-star thriller - Highly recommended.If you are a fan of Digital Copies and often choose your movie by which has the best DC, don't buy this version. They have made downloading this movie an absolute mess, forcing you to join 2 different sites - UltraViolet and Flixster - to be eligible to get it. And while both assure you of the ease of use, if you intend to download to an iPad, well, forget it. The apps their links provide do not allow a DC to get to your pad. While it may cost a few bucks more, go ahead and get the superior Blu-Ray version which allows for a iTune DC. Much, much easier ... my copy of this is going back to Amazon."
1,boooooooooo,plowed through it but this was the lamest batman ever......i didnt think i would ever fast forward through a batman movie
1,first dvd i purchased on amazon and it skips,"half way through the movie it skipped then no sound all of sudden. the dvd looked perfect, no scratches at all"
1,I could not watch the end,"I streamed this movie but it froze at the end. I e mailed amazon for a refund and they are usually really good at this sort of thing. The movie itself was really good, but I had to give it one star because I could not see the ending."
1,Utlra Violet Does not work,Tried to register for the flixster and ultra violet and it did not work. Website said down due to overcapacity.
2,My review,"Lacked so many things... horrible acting, hard to keep your attention, this just seemed nothing like other BatMan movies previously made!"
4,good movie,"I was not happy that the digital copy was different. You need to be online to veiw the movie. I was hoping it would just load on my Ipad, that only happens if I have wiFi hook up."
4,great ending,I loved this movie had a great plot and the bat was a alsome vichle thr end was a shocker it has a chance a another sequel aswell
2,Please No More,Please No More Dark Knight conglomerations of excessive violence and disappointing story lines. The Dark Knight story line is mindless.
2,NOPE!,I didn't like this movie! I don't know what the big deal is! It just didn't do it for me! No I don't have a reason!
4,Pretty good but lacked vision at times,"All in all, I enjoyed this movie. However, there were times that I was overwhelmed with the number of new characters, subplots, and twists. I think it could have been a little more straight forward."
2,Disappointed.,I really tried to give this movie a chance because I have watched all the other Batman movies but I just couldn't get into this one. I don't know if it was the darkness of the plot or the darkness of the movie itself (pitch black throughout the whole movie) but I got bored and finally turned it off after about an hour and a half.
4,Enjoyed the film,Particularly enjoyed detective Blake and thought Bane was well casted. Worth watching but not as good as Dark Knight but still a good movie.
5,Dark knight rises review,This entire Batman series was the best directed of all the comic book heros. Every movie touched a sense of my psyche. I can recall fearing for my own life at on point. Absolutely thrilling Great Movie. Great sequel. p.s 2nd was the best
5,Great!,Gave this too my son for Christmas and decided to watch it myself. I great movie but quite long too!
5,Good story line,This one is a little softer starting out but once he gets cranked up it really gets to going. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the Batman.
5,Movie/Dvd,A wonderful movie that our son wanted for his collection. It has no defects or problems and plays perfectly. Thank you.
5,"Limited Edtion, made it a must buy.","Had to get a copy of this limited release. and from the looks of it, its nice, haven't actually opened the box though. its for the collection."
4,Very impressive,"I got &#65279;the Darknight collection, I like &#65279;the joker's one better, &#65279;the part 2, this part 3 is not bad at all, for &#65279;the final trilogy this is very good, incredible saga"
4,"Incredible movie, a couple of quirks","The movie is great. Good way to end a trilogy. I'll leave the movie review for others. The Blue-Ray is good, but at first I thought something was wrong with it because it kept switching aspect ratios. But that is to accomodate some the IMAX content, as google taught me later. I'm a noob to Blu-ray so I don't know if this is common or not. The sound effects overpowered some dialog just often enough to be a little annoying, but I know that's common."
2,Should have stopped at the last Movie,"Sorry, but I found this movie to be slow and boring. Bane was just flat out boring and seemed to lack any acting skill at all. Glad I only wasted $1.99 to stream it on my Tivo. Even that was probably too much."
4,Dark Knight Rises,Great and creative plot to the final step of the trilogy. The Vilan is a very intelligent foe to the Gotham Place Department. Mix of 21 century technology and the reality of a dooms day event in a major metro city.
2,Time to give the Batman series a rest,Poor acting and marginal plot. The special effects couldn't compensate for the rest of the film. Worst Batman film to date.
1,awful movie,"As I was at the movie, sitting through this awful third sequel of the Batman franchise, I began to wonder: "" Am I the only one here who hasn't taken stupid pills""?. I mean, this movie is obviously so wrong and yet nobody seems to care. How comes that Batman who was conceived as the combination of such characters as Dracula, The Shadow, and Sherlock Holmes in this movie seems to have lost to all the characteristics of his inspirers?! If you know these characters well, you know what I mean!Also, More importantly,the movie is full of plot holes and the script is badly written. After half an hour, I got to the point I was wondering if there was a story at all. It was almost like watching Independence day meets Superman.Absolutely stupid!"
1,"Way too long, lacking intensity","If the last Batman you saw was ""The Dark Knight"" I recommend stopping there because the story doesn't get any better. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was the longest 3 hours of a movie EVER. It's depressing, it lacks intensity and frankly you just want to run and hit Batman with his own cane.Perhaps my criticism of this movie is masked because of the near perfection of ""The Dark Knight"" and the intensity of all characters involved: Batman, Rachel, Harvey Dent, Joker, even Commissioner Gordan was intense. This Batman just missed it... but watch it for yourself if you must, 3 hours you'll never get back."
1,Way to expensive,"I am not giving this item a 1 star by any means, batman is always a 10 star and I love it. i am giving the price a 1 star because I found the same exact thing at walmart for $34.96 and am picking it up today..."
2,"Nolan, please stay away from Batman","The story was falling apart bit by bit as it went on to the point of seeing how ridiculous and unbelievable it could get was more entertaining than the movie itself. And how can you call this a Batman movie when he is only in the movie for 20 minutes at most? It's a 2-hour 40-minute movie which could have easily been cut shorter. And they ruined the Bane character with the final reveal of the mastermind, also the way he was killed just made him look like a joke. The fight scenes are some of the worst choreography I've ever seen in a major blockbuster. Don't get me wrong, it has some great scenes like the first face-off between Bane and Batman, how Brcue Wayne eventually climbs out of the pit. The score was loud and really gave the movie an epic feel. Anne Hathaway's Selena was the standout character, very cool and sexy. But all these cannot even make up a decent movie."
1,AVOID - Will Not Work With iTunes,"I refuse to buy any WB product that only supports Ultraviolet Digital Copy. That means the product will not work on the biggest digital library system on the planet - iTunes. Why must I be subjected to access 95% of my library on iTunes and only 5% on some other inferior download scheme - UV? It makes no sense, and WB needs to wake up and join the 21st Century and offer a product that works in iTunes. Until they do, I will refuse to buy any of their physical media."
1,WHERE IS MY MOVIE DISK!@?,Great Movie but I recieved TWO Special Features Disk and a DVD Movie Disk. Where's my blu-ray Movie Disk!? I still can't believe this $*#^. Read aleast one other that has two special feature disk instead of the movie. My limited edition # 28155/3500. Anyone else get screwed?
1,Ultra Violet Sucks,Movies is good but don't buy this version. It is a total rip off! Ultra Violet Sucks! What a waste of money!
1,Ultraviolet is not welcome.,"Warner Brothers needs to stop forcing their lousy UltraViolet digital copies on consumers. Being a Mac user, there was no way to download the UltraViolet copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 when I purchased the blu-ray with the digital copy, and I have refused to buy any other Warner Brothers films that don't offer a viable, download-able digital copy for Mac users ever since."
3,"Good at times, mentally stimulating at parts, but Bane's mask/speech/accent threw me for a loop.","Take out Bane and Anne Hathaway and this movie would get 4 stars easily. While the comic book version of Bane was meant to be physically intimidating to Batman, Tom Hardy just doesn't measure up. I realize that comic books and the movie version are never gonna line up perfectly, I'm not the type to over-analyze those types of things. His voice box was intolerable the entire movie tho. I also didn't know Bane was Irish/Scottish/British all at the same time. While the action scenes were decent, living up to the first two movies was always gonna be near impossible. I admittedly may watch it again on cable when it comes in a few years. Until then I have my Dark Night and Batman Begins blu-rays to keep me company."
1,Why no 2-disc DVD edition?,I have both Batman Begins and Dark Knight in 2-disc DVD editions. I would have liked to have completed my set with a 2-disc edition of Dark Knight Rises but it seems to only be available in a 1-disc DVD with almost no special features or the Blu-Ray/DVD combo. I like the special features but don't want to be forced into buying this in Blu-Ray. So irritating.
1,1 star - Not the movie but Ultraviolet digital,I just cancelled my preorder after realizing this digital copy does not offer an itunes option. I do not want multiple eco-systems and will continue not to buy when forced.
4,Too Long,"The movie explained a great deal. If you watched the previous movies. You will notice characters such as the insane pyschiatrist as judge, the mayor, etc.My only complaint was that it was too long. I could not watch it one sitting. Also the sound effects are so loud and dialogue so low it was tiresome continually adjusting the volume for home use."
3,Great movie disappointing ending,I loved the movie but then the ending IMO sucked. Seems like they are setting up for another movie without batman.
1,the dull Knight drags,"This was the most drawn out and dull movie I've ever seen. Almost three hours long, the story could of been told in twenty minutes. I get the over the top characters like Bane it's based on a comic book but cat woman wasn't up to par, and who ever that other girl was(I couldn't stay focused) was pointless. Now Batman was useless cat woman (although unbelievable in the role) did all the work. Bruce Wayne's a workaholic, he would have never gone away and let his company fall apart...........OK I'm upset with this mess and I'm starting to ramble, I'm annoy myself in the process. Simple fact is I thought this film sucked and don't want you to waste your time and money like I did."
1,doesn't do the series justice,"i can't believe this garbage film, there's no message, there's no heroism, and *SPOILER ALERT* fricking autopilot saves the day, lame!"
5,great price and shipped quickly,i preorder this movie and it showed up right on the date they said it would and exactly as described.
4,good movie. isnt Chicago supposed to be the place this took place?,"Good action, another fine movie in the series, I streamed this through Amazon Instant video and it was convenient and worth the cost."
3,It was not up to the other shows,It was just filmed in New York they put a sine up saying Gotham City it did not look at all like the city
3,Doesn't measure up.,I give Cat Woman and Robin 5 stars. The movie left me blech. Poor story... didn't care about the characters in this one...other than Robin and Cat Woman. Hope we see more of them later
3,Batman - Dark Knight Rises,"Of all the Batman movies, this one left a bit to be desired. It had great effects, but the story was not that great."
2,Unconvincing,"Just didn't convince me. It seemed too ""movie like"" and unlike the previous dark knight movies just didn't grab me."
2,UltraViolet is not Digital Copy. It's poor quality streaming. And the Second Screen? SUCKS!,"OK, the movie is pretty good for a trilogy ending and we know that. I had fun in the movie theater despite of some serious goofs you might find in the IMDB page.However, the ""Second Screen"" app on your iPhone, iPad or whatever forces you to watch the movie looking at another screen, something you have to buy additionally. What if you don't have an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy? You're pretty much toasted. The Dark Knight DVD had a feature in the BD that let you watch the features while the movie was playing, same way as Inception. This ""App sync"" is a scam.Oh and I agree 100% with the 1-star reviews about UltraViolet, essentially a way to compete against Netflix with low-quality streaming. A rip-off worthy of LucasFilm or Apple (The Beatles' Apple and Cupertino's).In 5 years nobody will care about these Apps, but the movie will live on."
4,Weakest of the three but still good,"Let's face it - this had no chance of beating The Dark Knight. I'd also have to rate it a tiny bit below the Batman Begins movie. But still, even as the weakest of the three, it stands very high in movies released in 2012. If you enjoyed the first two, you'll watch this. If not, don't bother."
3,Just OK,"After all the hype surrounding this movie, we were expecting to be completely blown away. The movie wasn't bad, per say, it just wasn't great either. It felt incredibly long and several parts seemed to drag on forever. I absolutely loved the first two movies in the trilogy, but I don't think this one measures up."
2,not all that great,this movie left one guessing what batman was really about. there was a bunch of story strands flying around unlike the previous movies. i think another thing missing from this movie was the great action scenes that were in the other two.
1,"Way too long, needed lots of editing...","What were they thinking? Too long, too dark, too boring. Way better things to do with your time. Forget it."
2,Disappointing story and sound.,"I love comic book heroes, especially Batman. I have a home theater, so I rarely go to movies and when ""The Dark Knight Rises"" became available, I was torn between buying and streaming. Fortunately, I decided to stream because this movie is not worth owning and here are two reasons why:1) Poor quality audio. With all the special effects, you'd expect sounds to be exploding all around you, but not only were my surround speakers quiet, the dialog was either muffled or too loud. I could hardly understand Alfred, Batman mumbled many of his lines, and Bane's voice boomed way out of proportion.2) The story was stupid. I realize these movies are adapted from comic books, but come on - there has to be some believability and logic. I won't go into details because, if you're reading this, you probably haven't seen the movie, but be prepared to both scratch and shake your head throughout."
2,Dark Knight collapses,"Terrible all around. Not engaging, not much of a spectacle, no messages or peculiar questions per se, the plot is beyond trivial. Compared to Dark Night I'd give it minus two stars. Compared to an ordinary comic-based movie it's 2 stars."
3,Good but doesn't live up to The Dark Knight.,Rating the trilogy movies this one falls in last place. It's not that it's bad but it didn't have the appeal that Begins and Dark Knight had IMO.
3,batman,"not enough batman in movie, looked like it was a leadin for a new guy to play batman i liked christian bale"
2,Disappointed,"Poorly written scripts, scene, and editing, confusing storyline, was expecting a lot more of excitement and action. Multiple disruptions during the streaming didn't help either."
5,Great movie,"I love the movie, the DVD/Blu-Ray is great, but the UV program is terrible, just go back to a free digital copy!"
5,Good Story,The story line was very good. It held my attention as well as my children. The bad guy is just freaky.
5,The Dark Knight Rises,"Geat item, shipped fast. Great movie with plenty of action and which is what I was looking for and it arrived on time."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"IT WAS THE GREAT ENDING TO THE BATMAN TRIOLOGY, I WOULD DEFINITIONALY RECOMMEND FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD. GO SEE IT"
4,Great movie again!,"Loved this trilogy...it put life back into the Batman hero. Bale does a great job again and the plot, although I struggled to follow the first time, is good."
3,Not bad; not great,Gratuitous violence and evil. The story line depends to some extent on having watched the previous dark night movie. This movie is over-hyped. The acting is so so. The special effects are very good.
3,Good not great,A good movie but nowhere near the epic tale like the first 2. It is worth watching but not much replay
2,Unleavened Batman Finishes Flat,"Clearly, this film appeals to many viewers and likely, this is just not my cup of tea, but I found this installment to start out on an intriguing note and then just nose-dive from there. The story line seemed muddled, the acting uninspired and the outcome contrived. The action and dialog could have been condensed here to approximately 90 minutes; instead, the plot was dragged out to the point of being tiresome. Also, is it really necessary for the tone to be primarily so deadly and dreary all the time? Is this not based on comic book characters and a fictional city, etc.? Where's the camp? I mean really, ""Why so serious...?"""
3,One complaint,"My only complaint is with Warner Brothers. I want a combo pack with an iTunes copy not UltraViolet. SO my options are, 1. I can buy the combo pack and burn the DVD copy to my iTunes or 2. buy the Blu-ray only copy and then buy the iTunes copy. Solution 1, the digital copy is not as good and Solution 2, I pay twice. Why can't WB give us a code that can be used one time at our choice (iTunes, Amazon, or UV)?"
1,Did not meet the BATMAN expectation for me!!!!!!,"I thought the movie lacked action and took too long to get to the little action they had. I figure when you watch a BAtman movie you expect some fight scenes and cool gadgets but this movie lacked both. Batman wasn't even batman for most of the movie. Overall, I wish I waited for the free instant video instead of paying for it, but I did save $2 by renting the movie through Amazon instead of my cable carrier so I was not too unhappy, but wait for the DVD."
2,"Mumble, Mumble, Mumble","Everyone in this movie is hard to understand. Batman and his silly ""disguised"" voice and Bane and his mask, make this movie ""unhearable"". And...why can't batman keep his mouth closed? His mouth is always just hanging open...Is his mask too tight, does he have a cold?Bad long movie!"
2,Boring. Terrible twist.,Story reminds me of a bad Japanese Anime. Trying to be all epic and amazing but just a mess and tiresome. The twists in this film are terrible. Christian bale seems constipated. More terrible character voices i.e. bane. Ann hathaway has no sex appeal which is a must for cat woman. Why so do people like this film? I guess a lot of people are happy enough with big hollywood names and big hollywood budgets. Wish Bane just killed batman and destroyed gotham to put an end to the franchise. Thor was much better than this.
2,Sucked.....,"Batman hardly uses any gadgets in the movie; instead he prefers to get angry and fist brawl everyone and gets pwned constantly doing so. I watched this with my mother who saw the first and second Batman movies when they first came out, the old ones with Jack Nicholson. All we did is laugh, laugh, and laugh during this movie. It's just that cheesy and poorly written. Throughout the film she asked ""Why does Batman get beaten up so much in the new movies?"" This was the first new Batman movie she had seen and I assured her it would be great...... I was embarrassed...... The last two movies were awesome, what happened? Also why does Bane talk like he's British when He's supposedly from the middle east. So confused. Yeah this one is a turd, I don't recommend watching it. If someone gives you the movie for free then maybe, but other than that don't do it. Batman The Dark Night Rises sucked."
3,Eh. Meh. Neh. It's Okay.,"Catwoman steals the show. Understand that firstly. Without her this movie would have been pretty boring. This tale is more cerebral. Batman is coming to terms with his place, with himself, with his city. It is an entertaining movie, but it is far from epic. There should have been many more battles between Batman and the bad guys. The Sandman is in this film, but he does nothing. I felt like this was more of a drama than a superhero tale. The acting is great. The worst actor is actually Christian Bale, unfortunately, with his stupid sore throat Batman. Give him a lozenge. I want to see Batman kicking butt. This film had too little of that. As I said, Batman was a dud in this film. Bane and Catwoman and Levitt's cop character were more promising and interesting personalities. It is worth a watch, but do not expect anything supremely entertaining. It has some thrills, but nothing like the previous two movies."
2,Let down big time,"Worth a dollar rental, but no more than that. Batman seems like a chump in this one who gets his arse kicked every time you turn around. Most of the movie he seems depressed and un-sure of himself and most are glad he is gone.Bane is a joke."
3,Okay but slow,This series maybe coming to the end of its life. This movie was slow which is a problem when the movie is over 2 hours long. Good action scenes but to far and in between for my taste. Glad I waited to watch it at home.
3,Sequel fails to excite,"Bane was just not as great of a felon as the prior characters. When you have to wear a mask that blocks your facial expression it is just really hard to express yourself and connect with the audience. It picked up nicely on where Bruce Wayne left off in the the Dark Knight. Of this trilogy, it was the worst."
3,Okay not true to comic,Movie was okay but was not true to comic. Certain plots were changed for movie script expected Robin to play a role too. I was disappointed.
2,Huge Disappointment,"The trailer looked good but I was worried about the length which is nearly 3 hrs. The pacing was bad and at parts it dragged so bad I kept wondering when is this gonna end? I wasn't crazy about Bane's heavy accent because it was difficult to understand him. The so called ""epic conclusion"" is an epic disappointment and failure in my mind. Nolan should have quit while he was ahead with The Dark Knight which was way better. I was excited about the casting of Anne Hathaway as Catwoman but they didn't give her the screen time and character development Catwoman deserves. Overall I would red box it for cheap or go to the library and pick it up. Not worth paying to see it that's for sure."
3,Nothing in comparison the second part of triology,"It was okay. The part of building of strength and coming out of hole for batman seemed rushed, too predictable. Not many twists and turns and layer of complexity as the second part."
3,Long and Meandering,It started out interesting... but this movie is like a hike that took longer than expected... it's fun in the beginning and towards the end you wonder what you got yourself into. This is definitely a screenwriters flop... a better movie could have been made by condensing the entire thing. It's a bad thing when you get bored during a flick.
3,Best is yet to come?,"Not the best caped crusader story,but am looking forward to a sequel, hopefully!! The story line made Batman look pathetic,weak and not really a hero"
2,"Glad It""s Over","The two stars I gave this movie was generous, because if was simply ridiculious and a waste of my money. I wished there was a way to get my money back"
2,Dissapointed,I was a bit dissapoibted with this one compared with the last two movies in he franchise. I wanted to like it through the very end but it was a tough one to get through. The ending did have some redeeming qualities.
5,easy money,I bought this originally for myself but saw how much they were selling for on ebay and decided to sell it too. Tripled my money in no time. :)
5,Awesome,"Probably the best of the Batman movies. Catwoman, Bane and Batman's back story. Not the same without the Joker, but that seems to be the only think lacking from this installment of the series."
3,&#11088;&#11088;1/2,"Why are super Heros revealing who they are? The hero should never reveal his/her identity. This movie was way too long, and not that good. Best part of the movie is the beginning on the plane. After that all you get is Batman getting beat by Bain like a step child. Yeah, Bain beat the brakes off Batman. Don't waste 3hrs on this film."
2,Dissapointed,Disappointed with how cheezily the story was executed. Anna hathaway gave a poor attempt at action scenes and Christian bale is not a good batman. His character voice for batman is poor and not believable.
3,Nothing special!,"I bought this pack thinking there would be extra scenes like you can buy at target or Walmart because of how much it was, but this combo pack doesn't include anything special, just the movie. Mediocre."
2,too violent,After the recent bout of massacres I found the scenes involving mass shooting of innocent people by terrorist who could get through security unsettling. The time of these movies being entertaining has passed. Plus it was way too long and if you didn't follow the comic books the plot was confusing.
2,The Dark Knight Rises movie,"This was a Christmas gift for my 9 year old grandson. He got bored and wandered away when it was about half over. My daughter, son-in-law and I watched it all the way through, and though it was very confusing, and not particularly good."
2,It does not work correctly,"The DVD does not work correctly. No matter what we do we can not get the captioning to turn off- so there were words across the screen the entire movie. The ""captioning off"" button never worked."
2,"stupid characters, stupid plot, stupid action","There is no excuse for the stupidity of the plot, characters, and even the action -- all acting insensibly to manufacture unconvincing drama.As a bonus, you get lots of aristocracy propaganda. It is Batman written for the 1% and their fans."
2,Yawn...,"Special effects are great. The movie is boring... it just drags.The acting is OK, but Bale is overrated in this ""final"" movie."
3,It's one way to kill a couple hours...,...but I can think of a few better ones. It was not as exciting or as interesting as I had hoped it might be. Ah well. You win some you lose some.
3,Way too long!,"I really enjoyed the 2 Batman movies that preceded this one. However, this one was too long. I wouldn't have minded so much if the length had added to the story, but it felt like a tangent that should have been edited."
3,"A nice conclusion to the trilogy, but a little long","This was an OK ending to the latest Batman trilogy, but it was a little long. My wife was having trouble keeping engaged, and there were several places where the story was fairly obvious, with nothing that surprising."
2,Not worth the rental fee,"This one is up there with the Batman movie with George Clooney, Uma Thurman, & Arnold. Just poorly done. Lack of continuity to the scenes, the actual story could have been good but it was pretty ADD"
4,1 the dark knight rises is entertaining,liked that the same actors played same roles as the other two movies. it is was entertaining which a lot of movies lack now a days.
3,Average,"Worth watching for the visual effects, fight scenes and special effects. Plot line was a little difficult to follow. Overall it was average."
3,Over hyped,Not as good as the first two. Longer than necessary. Too many illogical twists. Effects are good but story is lacking.
3,Good Story,"The story line is very good but what distracted from the movie was the sound. Dialogue is VERY hard to understand due to background noise/music. Other than that, not bad; lots of action and you are able to follow the movie without much dialogue."
3,"OK, but could have been better.","The movie was entertaining, but very drawn out. It was much less batman-focused than you would expect it to be. It did not stay on par with the previous two films in the series. A good watch, if you have three hours to kill."
3,Least favorite Batman yet,Very slow.... it was almost like they deliberately wanted to distance themselves from the comic book. Very slow and too dark to follow.
2,This was BORING.,"The story was expected. The middle portion was truly a yawn. The end was ok.While I'm not a huge fan of blow-em-up movies, I do enjoy action movies. This wasn't one of them. I gave it two stars for Catwoman only. Now THAT was a highlight."
3,OMG,"It was incredibly long, incredibly confusing and could have been about an hour shorter. The last 30 minutes made the movie worth it, but it was a bit overdone."
2,Cardboard characters + Twisted Story + Special Effects = Disappointing,"We were fans of the first two movies but this one just didn't work well. The acting was inconsistent -- especially from Christian Bale. He is supposed to be injured and having trouble walking -- (he can barely get out of his car) then he twirls around the dance floor as if nothing were wrong -- only to limp again (and use a walking stick) later. Bruce Wayne doesn't have any emotional depth to him -- the moments he seems more . . . ""involved"" in what's happening and effected, come off as cheesy.It's good when a movie surprises you. This one doesn't have twists so much as it seems twisted. Really the story just seemed to be a backdrop for the special effects --- so the choppiness makes sense in a way.This is a visually appealing move with lots of action that still manages to be boring at times."
2,"Big budget, lots of explosions, lots of Bat-Toys, weak, boring plot","I think they tried to produce an 'epic' finale with this film but lost focus on the story. Half-way through the movie I turned to my wife and said ""you know, this just isn't a very good movie"" and she agreed. By the end we were both just anxious for it to end and neither of us cared who lived or died."
2,"Heavy handed, poorly edited, and joyless","While the film starts out promisingly, with good (if not limited) characters, and decent acting, it quickly goes down hill once the main threat is revealed.At that point the film becomes a jumble of implausible or unexplained subplots, which despite the movie's length, feel rushed. The main plot lacks subtlety, and feels only tangentially connected to the character struggle.My first instinct is to blame editing, which makes its awkwardness especially known in the action scenes, (shot of person, shot of action, shot of other person, shot of action.... WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?. After thinking about it a bit, I just feel like they were trying to cram in too many angles (literally and figuratively).Also, the sound design, good lord, do I need swelling music in every scene? How about you turn that down so I can hear the muffled dialog?"
4,The Dark Knight Rises,"Good story line,but his fighting sucks big time!! Quality of the movie was awesome,I will recommend this movie to a friend"
4,Finishes the Trilogy,"There is lots of action and special effects, but the plot is somewhat convoluted. However, it is worthwhile movie to watch and enjoy."
5,Dark Knight Rises is one of the best super hero movies EVER,"Christian Bale has knocked it out of the park as the new Batman and brought this super hero back to life (Batman used to be cheesy like a B-movie); I've enjoyed Batman Begins, Dark Knight, etc. but Dark Knight Rises had additional twists and depth, plus had me crying (in a good way) as I found it very inspirational, not just a great action movie. This version of Batman and this particular film can compete with any of the best super hero movies -- what makes a great super hero movie is a believable character that is fighting evil/bad guys but also fighting within to be a better person, overcome obstacles, etc. -- and the absolute best parts are when the character is willing to sacrifice him or herself -- think Passion of the Christ, Braveheart, Captain America, Batman Dark Knight Rises. Just a different level of hero."
2,doesn't live up to its billing,"despite what the trailer suggests, this movie is more about pointless dialogue and self exploration than real superhero action. since when do villains/heroes walk around talking about how they feel about their place in the world like they are in a counseling session. it took about an hour and half of useless feminized dialogue for real action: that's when Bman got beaten like a two eggs by Bane. catwoman was pointless (wanna be seductress who steals ish and flips), as was bane (muscle bound philosopher with a 1/3rd of plastic wolf mask), as was batman (deliberate, old/weak, and serious) . . . is it just me or did anyone else wonder how bane could get so big and strong with a wolf shaped muzzle (with no opening) straped to his face, which by the way made his voice sound like a high tenor. ridiculous. but somebody got paid."
3,Meh. The other ones were better.,I felt like the actors were kind of phoning this one in. It felt a bit long (and I tend to like longer movies). For some reason I was just bored with it and wanted it to get over. There were just so many unrealistic things going on that I could hardly watch.
2,I just didn't get it.,The Dark Knight Rises just keep me lost all the way through.Maybe just me but could not stay with it.
2,Digital Copy CANNOT be downloaded,I purchased this movie so I could have a Blu Ray copy and a digital Copy version as well. The digital copy is a version that CANNOT be downloaded and is incompatible with Apple products! I might as well of just bought the regular Blu Ray version for less.
5,Batman Fan,"I'm a female movie fan who loves action. Thoroughtly enjoyed this movie. Reason for purchase of this DVD release, the access to download of ultra violet digital copy for my PC."
3,A bit slow,"Ok at best, it took along time for the movie to pick up any momentum. I will say the last 10 minutes were probably the best part of the movie. Is it worth seeing? Sure, it finishes the story of the Dark Knight series."
4,background info,"even with the fancy special effects, the story was slow. It did give some background info ending up with a good finish."
4,zone all ?,Does anyone know if the bluray or dvd discs are zone all or not ? i m quite interest in the information.a French customer
1,The Dark Knight Rises,I hated this movie.Poor lttle kids that went to see Batman. He looked more sinister then the villians when he did show up.
2,I was not able to see the complete end of the dvd. I fell asleep. I will try again.,"I fell asleep. Did not seethe end of the picturre.However, I seemed excitin enough. I will try it again ."
2,ohhh nooo,i really enjoyed the first two movies in this trilogy..this one was a super huge disappointment...boring pretty much sums it up...the big fight scenes where childish at best...bane..bain..the big dumb idiot was terrible as a villian..just plain dumb...not a good way for the franchise to end...god i hope the ending doesn't signal another atrocious movie in the future...
5,Best of the trilogy,Christopher Nolan is a mastermind. He knew how to end a great series with a bang! I love every single minute of this movie.
1,Painfully slow plot,"This is the worst Batman movie, to date. Long, slow and predictable storyline Anne Hathaway's performance as Catwoman is wooden and stilted. I'm so glad I rented this, instead of throwing away my money on a DVD purchase.What a snoozer!"
1,Unable to watch as service was terrible Please remove from my bill,It was unwatchable as the amazon service continuously paused to load the video data. I am on a trial premium membership for a month and have been extremely disappointed with the quality of the transmission. If it does not improve I will not continue my membership. I should not be billed for this movie as I was forced to watch cable TV instead.
2,Meh.,I wouldnt recommend renting this. It has about 1 hour of extra dialogue and is pretty uneventful in my opinion. You should wait for it to come out on cable and sleep through it then.
2,Surprised at how terrible this movie is,"Clumsily plotted, overly long, and atrocious dialog. Some nice explosions, though. It honestly makes The Avengers look like Citizen Kane."
3,A dissapointment,"This overly long film was a test to see how long we could keep watching. The story line was pretty much incomprehensible, dark, gloomy, and made the experience feel like a chore. We stuck it out and then wished we hadn't spent the $4.99 to rent it. I had heard some good things about it, which made it all the more frustrating. Give me the first ""Batman"" series any day."
2,holding my nose,"It was boring, I fell asleep at one point. A poorly conceived and very poorly executed project. I would not recommend this picture to anyone. Yet another piece of trash hyped for box office numbers, with no redeeming value what so ever."
1,Horrible Movie,"Nothing about this movie is redeeming, and normally just being pretty would cut it. By the end I felt like I was being tortured to watch the rest of this movie. Horrible character development, incoherent and abstract plot with absurd sense of time. Horrible attempts at misguided political sentiment. Just wow you followed up on the Batman series with this. Every decision maker on this movie should be exiled for pandering, and failure to adhere to movie fundamentals."
1,incredibly boring and lacks spark,"movie was incredibly boring and lacked the spark of the the original dark knight movie. the best part had to be the end, consequently Nolan is good at visuals but the story of Bane and Gotham turning to rubble seemed very cliche and the introduction of newly hashed characters did not capture interest as the movie progressed."
5,Another Great Batman movie,Mr Nolan comes threw again with an epic tale of the dark night. Nice to see new characters from the comic come to life
4,It's a conclusion with a twist,"Aren't they all? Well acted, decently written, and the action sequences are poignant. Certainly worth watching and I never even found myself looking at my watch (despite its 2.5+ hours)."
3,not that great,I expected a lot better but the story was slow. It got better towards the end but by then it was too late. Disappointing.
2,Find a better use for your 2.5 hours,"After all the hype, we thought this might be a good choice. We were wrong. Boring and predictable dialogue and plot. Several times we just looked at each other and admitted we had no idea what was going on. Flat acting added to the dullness of it all. We were glad when it was over...not even worth our $3.99."
1,too weak,"batman once again is a brooding pussy who can't get it together, Bane was cool, but that was it, too far fetched."
1,Digital Copy already expired,"I bought this and come to find out that unlike Itunes, ultra violet has a limited time to get the digital copy. I just purchased the dvd and find out the download was expired. There should be some reduction in the price if the digital copy is no longer available. Bring back itunes! I am totally miffed at this! Should not advertise digital download if it is not available."
1,"No iTunes Copy, Just UltraViolet","It is unacceptable that movies do not include an iTunes digital copy. UltraViolet does not, and cannot provide the same user experience as is afforded by iTunes media."
1,Give me an iTunes Digital Copy or don't bother including one.,"I purchased movies in the past with an UltraViolet digital copy. Big mistake - HUGE. I spent hours trying to just get into the accounts they are forcing me to set up and then I could not download my movies. What a waste. I would give this movie - The Dark Knight Rises - five stars for the actual movie, but the inclusion of this crap ""digital download"" makes this a one star movie. I searched and searched for a version with an iTunes download - my preference - but to no avail. Amazon, don't sell this UltraViolet digital copy crap. I cannot get my movie from UltraViolet/Flixster. I do not want to stream the movie I purchased, I want to download it."
1,Rubbish,"Other than Anne Hathaway's performance, this movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, even for a comic book movie. The art direction and cinematography is dreary gloomy and boring. This is a movie searching for a point, yet attempting to be profound or even sensical. It fails. The film single-handedly makes one wonder whether Nolan's prior success was a fluke or whether he has had a brain transplant since the first movie. Bale's Batman is a weak and feckless. Fusion of the Dark Knight Returns and Bane storylines was ill-conceived and poorly executed. What you end up with is a three hour movie that should've been one and a half hours long with a tight story and a point. You can almost see Nolan attempting to be relevant or profound. His film is neither. It is a colossal piece of garbage."
1,"Ultraviolet, nuff said",I want a real digital copy. 1 star for the UV garbage they're forcing on us. Include a REAL digital copy and i'll buy the movie and up the star rating .thanks!
2,bad movie,"The 2 first Barman movies were good. But this one is just bad. Hollywood Cliche. Example among others, Wayne in the bottom of a well with a vertebre dislocated got fix with a fist hit, then he starts to do some pushes and abdomino to get ready to climb. I forgot, it is easer to climb without rope. Also he goes from a sunny hot country, (middle east maybe) to USA in a few minutes. Just to show you how bad it is. the movie is also to long and keep giving these crap..The director went back to the cliche hollywood type of movie (emotion. compassion BS)"
1,Digital Copy Scam,You only get an ultraviolet copy not a true iTunes digital copy. This UV program is awful - have to set up an account with every studio and can't watch it on my AppleTV! Don't spend more for this. Just buy a plain Blu-Ray copy or just get it on iTunes.Very disappointed and wish I hadn't opened the packagg a few moments ago.
4,Love the movie but HATE UltraViolet,"You've seen enough reviews about the movie - it's great. This UltraViolet ""digital"" version is terrible. I think it was pretty rotten of them to switch digital distribution with the last film."
2,Oh My!,"I really wanted to like this movie, that's why I tried sticking with it. But the reality was that I was bored by the characters and the storyline. And fell asleep half way in."
4,Long but good,I think this movie does quite well to round out this trilogy and cleverly open the door to what might come next. Definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of the first two in the series.
4,Fanboy Eberts v. Product Review,I really just want to know if this version is worth owning vs. the other versions. Are the extra features worth the money?I can only scan through so many fan-boy wannabe movie reviews before I completely lose interest. I'm looking to buy the movie on Blu-Ray so clearly I liked it and could care less if you found it to be a fitting end to the trilogy or worthy of the Chris Nolan oeuvre. I just want a product review and not opinions on the content of the movie we all saw in the theater.
5,"I was dubious, but no more!","Wow. just, wow. I gotta say, the power-house cast and the twists and turns of the plot were amazing. Brilliant. And the end left room for the individual's imagination--love it!Definitely a must-see!"
5,Awesome flick,"Loved the trilogy and I thought this wrapped it up nicely. It gets better the more you watch it, you start to catch little nuances."
4,Pretty decent movie,Not sure I buy Ann Hathaway as the tough chick but whatever. I bought mine used so a bit cheaper ... doubt I would pay full price as this does not have all the impact of some of the other high tech movies which I prefer
5,Love it,Such a good movie. I am sad that the series ended but it went out on an awesome note. I have seen this movie a ton of times and love it every time I watch it.
3,Make sure you have time,Very good movie. Just make sure you have time to watch it. We saw it 2 times through Amazon Prime to get more of the details.
3,THE DARK KNIGHT RISES BLURAY/DVD COMBO REVIEW,I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THE DARK KNIGHT RISES BUT IAM SAID THE WAY THE TRILOGY ENDED I WONT REVEAL SPOILERS THE MOVIE HAS LOTS OF ACTION SCENES BUT THE FIRST HOUR WASTED WAS PRETTY BORING WITH LOTS OF TALKING AND MINOR ACTION HERE AND THERE HOWEVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE MOVIE REALLY PICKS UP STEAM SO IF YOUR A BATMAN FAN ITS A MUST BUY SPECIALLY THE BLURAY/DVD COMBO AT 18 BUCKS THAT A AWESOME PRICE.
3,Movie is great 5 stars but but when will they release blu-ray and digital copy NOT UV,I do not like UV and its digital subscription.. I need blue-ray and a downloadable digital copy to use on my mobile devices such as an ipad.. Will warner bro ever release this combo? i will not buy it until they release a blu-ray and downloadable digital copy?
4,darn good,Other ones were better but this one was darn good. I felt it was a little slow and could have had more fun action parts or introduced new robotic weapons or cars or something.
4,Happy Purchaser,"The display is great, but I'd rather have had the discs in a ""normal"" case, as opposed to the somewhat awkward, kind of cheap looking, round case. Other than that, even the box, which is numbered is really cool. Based on the current price, this is already a collector's item."
4,Nice Plot,This movie brings answers some of the questions of what would happen to Batman if it came down to Gotham's needs.
3,Not great,Not really a great end to the franchise. It feels like the whole middle of the movie could have been removed and you wouldn't have missed much.
2,"Worst batman ever, except for Ann Hathaway.",The only entertaining part was that Batman got his ass kicked through the entire movie. Ann Hathaway was really hot.
2,Dark Knight sinks,"Not Batman begins. Not the same Bane, and Catwoman was not believe able. violence without reason doesn't make a move good. nuff said"
2,The Dark Knight filmed,The movie was very disappointing. the hype the movie had was overrated. I feel like I wasted my money on this movie. I feel like I wasted my time watching this movie. it was't everything it was said to be. don't get me wrong it had its moments. Overall very very disoappointed.
3,pathetic villian makes for an apathetic viewer,"This was not at all what it was cracked up to be. The villian, especially when compared with the Joker, was just not very dislikable. Sure he was evil but he didn't really get under your skin and make you wanna see him die. Plus the way his voice sounded made him seem like an idiot with headgear."
2,Not as good as the first two,The movie was way to long... Not as good as the first two. Bane is supposed to be a lot bigger than he was in the movie. Awful villain. No comparison to Heath Ledger.
5,Just Awesome,"Great movie, Gordon Levitt was great. Great action, amazing ending. This is truly a cannot miss movie. Almost as good as the first"
4,Dark Knight Rises,"I am not much of a Batman nor a comics fan. Thus, I viewed this film from an action angle. It is an exciting film. You even forget that it is about 2 and a half hours long."
2,Too many twists for an adventure movie.,Things keep changing with strange personalities inter-relating in strange ways. The movie does not stand on its own very well. It relies greatly on earlier parts of the story.
2,Holy Crap,I mainly buy movies that have digital copies so that I can watch anywhere as well as at home with the family. This movie was supposed to come with one but it uses Ultra Violet which now uses flixster so that is two accounts to create and fill your inbox with spam. It has been almost a week and still haven't gotten it to work yet. LAME!!!
2,eh,"I enjoyed watching it, but the plot had a large number of holes and it is by far the weakest of the trilogy."
2,I was unable to watch the whole movie because of the horrible mixing for sound effects,I had a sleeping baby in another room and the sound was so poorly mixed that I had to turn it down when the sound effects kicked in and then couldn't hear the dialogue. The blasting of the sound effects did nothing for me but cause me to have to turn it off because it was unwatchable.
2,serious let down,after the dark knight batman had big shoes to fill and this movie was just not capable of doing it.
3,Not great,"It just didn't do anything for me. It was an okay movie, but i don't think it was great movie."
5,excellent!! came on the same exact day it was released! brand new,Very happy with the service and the movie. Excellent. This was a gift for someone and he loves it very much!!
5,Excellent movie,I enjoyed this movie. liked it very much very well made. Good continuance from the other Batman movie made by Christian Bale
5,First successful business with Amazon!,"It was my first ever item I bought from Amazon. The item delivered few days earlier than the indicated deadline. The package is good and the item is the same as described. Have not opened it yet to play, but already know the movie is awesome. Thanks Amazon!"
5,The Dark Knight Rises DVD,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" was on a ""wanted list"" for Christmas; she was pleased to recieve it. The price was right, too!"
3,Avg,"Mis-casted. Especially for some of the women, but overall clean and fun. Bane's voice was weak, and the audio on the amazon copy is mixed horribly for viewing on Xbox on stereo television."
3,It was not what I expected,I expected much more from this movie from what I heard. It was disappointing to say the very least. I thought it was boring.
2,Just a fist fight fest.,Boring.Just didn't hold my attention.Just a bunch of fist fighting.Kept finding myself drifting off to something more interesting.
4,Nolan's saga,"Much has been said about the plot holes and logic jumps in the last installment of The Dark Knight saga but I can't help but get caught up in some very good moments in this film. Bale's Batman showed us a deep and tortured soul. Hathaway was by far the best Catwoman ever. And the torch has been passed on, hopefully so we can get a Justice League movie at somepoint."
2,A Pointless exercise in action Candy,"Not that it is important to make sense of this, but I cannot ignore the fact that the villains in this Cartoon of a human drama had no motivation do do any of the evil they performed. What is equally stultifying is that they choose to do all their bad deeds to just This City called Gotham with no apparent connection to it. What becomes even more bizarre is how the rest of the world simply ignores what is happening which clearly goes on more days, weeks, maybe even months."
3,Snoozefest,"3 generous stars, mostly because it wasn't, totally garbage but it was very boring whenever Bane was off the screen. Let's face it, we all want to see more of the famous Batman enemies. Joker was killed off but there is still plenty of cool ones. Also I'm still not sure if Anne Hathaway's character was supposed to be Catwoman or not. Just no comparison to Iron Man, Thor, Avengers or any other modern Superhero flick. Get with the times Batman."
4,surprisingly enjoyable,"The film was very well done, kept my interest, and was suspenseful. It was definitely more ""adult"" than I imagined."
3,Its Entertainment,"Pretty long, glad I rented and watched the movie at home. Thought the movie would be better but it was just ok."
2,Broken/slow connection with Amazon,"The connection was terrible, the movie slow which was a catastrophic combination that made the experience very unsatisfactory and tedious."
3,"""The Dark Knight Hobbles Around""","Ok, it's better than most movies made, but if Rises is a 5 and Begins is a 4, than this is a 3.Some good reviews out there about all the odd things about the movie, so I'll just mention one thing that probably bothered me the most. After 8 years, Bruce is hobbling around with a cane like he's an old man who just got beat up last week? Sure he may have sustained injuries that a normal guy would be like this without seeking treatment....but he's a billionaire. And in this batman world of super gadgets, we're supposed to believe he hasn't gotten the best doctors in the world to either fix him or use artificial means to make himself more of a ""bionic"" batman? By now he should have been back on the streets for years showing up every once in a while during the late hours to pummel some bad guy just so they know he's still around."
5,The dark knight rises blu ray,I really enjoy the dark knight rises movie. The disk and everything else seems to be in perfect working order.
4,Great end to the trilogy..,"Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy is arguably the best of all the Marvel comicbook hero movies. Good storylines, great action scenes, and of course stellar acting have been features of the series, and the Dark Knight Rises is a wonderful end to the series."
2,Ending the Batman franchise on a low note.,"I felt like the best in the trilogy was ""Batman Begins"". It went continually down after that movie. This one seemed to build and then everything fell apart at the end. It felt like they didn't know how to end it. Too many loose ends for my taste."
1,"Well, there's 2 hours and 45 minutes of my life I'll never get back.","Masked man 1: Mumblemumblemumble.Masked man 2: Mumblemumblemumble.Alfred: I quit.Masked man 1: Mumblemumblemumble.Masked man 2: Mumblemumblemumble.Catwoman aka Han Solo: I don't stick out my neck for nobody.Masked man 1: Mumblemumblemumble.Masked man 2: Mumblemumblemumble.Prisoner aka Yoda: Fear is why you fail.Masked man 1: Mumblemumblemumble.Masked man 2: Mumblemumblemumble.Commissioner Gordon: Wow, it was Bruce Wayne! I am the dumbest detective who ever lived!Nothing ever became this movie like the ending of it. Some people have called it art. I would not be one of them."
2,The Dark Blight,"This film is easily the weakest of the 3. It is well acted and has good production values, but fails to entertain due to a bloated running time, weak villains, lack of batman, superfluous side characters and numerous plot holes.If you stopped at the end of the previous film, you wouldn't regret it. It's the film you need to complete a trilogy, but not the one you deserve as a fan. It's ultimately disappointing."
3,"Good action movie, mediocre batman movie","As stated above, it was a decent movie if you just want violence. But as far as batman movies go this one really dropped the ball.One of my least favorite."
3,Okay.,Too drawn out. Weak underdeveloped story. His time in the prison especially made me think that but everything else seemed thrown together.
3,Not as good as the last one,"Overall a good movie, but not as good as The Dark Knight. And Bane's and Batmans Modulated voice really gets annoying."
2,Horrible sound but kind of entertaining,"I am not a big Batman fan, but I do like Christian Bale, so for me watching is movie is not a big thrill. There were parts of the movie that I could not understand a word of what they were saying, especially with the villain Bane's lines. I would say that it is worse than previous Batmans I watched."
3,The worst out of the series IMO.,The worst out of the series IMO. Could have been much better. I am looking forward to the next movie so that this series does not end on a weak note.
2,disappointing movie,"I actually went out and bought this movie based on what some others said. Didn't see it in the theater. Overall was disappointed, it seemed overly long and drawn out. And it seems movies lately have to be so extreme just to interest the younger movie going crowd. This movie was extreme in its plot and how bad they can make the bad guys. Lets make it so extreme, so hopeless, such overwhelming odds... it takes away from the movie and the characters. Its not the best Batman movie and not even the best super hero movie this year - Avengers was a better movie because it was more interesting. Part of the Batman legacy is how he can outsmart his opponents, and this movie didn't have much of that."
2,This is incredibly boring,"I was surprised at how dull this film was. I forced myself to sit through it. I kept thinking things would start to improve, but they never did. I would tell someone else thinking about seeing this film that, if you never see it, you won't be missing anything."
3,Entertaining but not as good as The Dark Knight,The movie is good but did not meet my expectations based on other people reviews and compared to the Dark Knight.
3,Thought the previous ones were better.,"I didn't care for ""mopey"" Batman, but special effects were good. A depressed Batman was just annoying! Liked Cat Woman though!"
5,Dark knight rises,"The final movie of the Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy.I went to see this movie on opening night at a midnight showing.i loved it! In my opinion,the dark knight rises was the best superhero film of 2012. its far better than the avengers or the amazing spiderman.In the dark knight rises i actually cared about the characters.I even felt sympathy for the villian [Bane].I am so glad to add this to my dvd collection."
1,No iTunes digital option?,I love this movie but I hate having to choose between buying on bluray or through iTunes. I've had such a horrible experience with ultra violet and iTunes makes it so much easier to share between my devices.Please at least give the option of an iTunes download like dark knight or avengers
1,The Blu-ray disc was flawed,The Blue-ray disc had a portion of the movie where the sound cut off completely. I have returned the product for a refund.
4,I guess we got closure from this one.,"It is an end to the trilogy, Bain is cool but it seems like the whole movie should have been spread out into two parts. I found if lacking but enjoyable. it is still a fun movie and worth the 3.99 to rent but i wouldn't buy it until a box set comes out with all three movies together in some sort of special edition,"
3,A very long movie....,"Great special effects, good plot, but it went on and on and on..... The plot was difficult to follow due to numerous sub-stories. I think it could have been trimmed down to about 2 hours and our family would have enjoyed it a little more. Definitely worth the time to watch."
5,Great Movie,"The movie had all the ingredients for a great movie. It had a great villian in Bane. Batman had to reach down deep in his soul to overcome defeat. The storyline had nice twists and turns near the end, and the addition of Robin was nicely done. The cast was first rate with Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Christian Bale. The storyline, the special effects, the new gadgets, and top notch acting from all contributed to a great entertaining movie."
3,Story Line?,"I'm not sure why, but the story didn't seem to go alone well. First he can't do it, next he don't want to do it. and than he finally does the deeds and wins against all odds...."
2,Didn't Rise to the Occassion,"I'm sure the movie itself was a fine view. However, I didn't get much of a chance to see it, as the copy that I purchased froze on an increasing frequency, thus preventing one from getting ""the picture."" Kudos to Amazon, though, they refunded my cost including the shipping as well as the return shipping."
2,Boring & What's with that voice?,"Why does the villain sound like Goldmember from the Austin Powers movies? That's not even close to cool. How could they even consider putting that moron in the next movie after Heath Ledger's disturbed performance in The Dark Knight?This movie was boring. It had senseless action. It somehow forgot that the rest of the Earth outside NYC might actually help in a situation like this. I mean... Whatever. Maybe I'm not as whimsical (maybe that's not the word) as necessary to like when trash like this is shoved down my throat.Save your time, go outside."
4,New Twist,You can't go wrong with this Batman sequel. It is well worth the time and money! I really enjoyed the new cast additions.
2,"Long, poorly organized and boring!","This movie did not hold my interest...after the 90 minute mark, it became almost painful. Cat woman was cool though."
2,A Knights Deception,"The Dark Knight is one of my fav.i was looking foward for this sequel,the first hour was soooo boring,Bane is not even impressive nor scary with he's pathetic voice,Catwoman was hot but that's it...the movie was ok but i expected more!!"
2,Batman Disappoints,"I think i speak for a lot of people when I say that I want to see batman kick ass. I want to see him rise above evil using his unique gadgets, vehicles, and fighting at night without even being seen. I don't really care what hardships he went through to get him to where he is. This was way too dramatic and too much talking. It was a movie where Batman gets beat up for an hour and a half then somehow comes out on top. This is not the Batman I want to know. As Batman is my favorite superhero, I was truly disappointed in this film."
2,look at my review,"Okay, my brother bought it and i was ready to watch it. He got home at like 8 and we watched the whole thing. It was a very long movie. Okay, if you love the fighting scenes in batman, than this movie isn't for you. I saw the first dark knight and it was probably one of the best movies i have seen and i have seen plenty. This movie sucked. Their was barely any fighting scenes, Anne Stathoway or whatever was a big biotch the whole movie until the end, and i didn't like the story line either. This is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Don't waist you money or time buying this, if you are gonna watch it, rent it instead or burrow it from someone. It was also very slow in the beginning."
2,long and mostly boring,A marginal Batman portrayal. wasted my $$. Even a sexy woman foil did not save this tedious film. WAsted time watching it.
3,What I think of the Dark Knight Rises.,"It was too long, just thrown together and should have been the dark knight that continued from batman begins after batman killed Raz Algul."
2,"Movie is awesome, delivery is garbage","Ultraviolet is the worst idea in marketing ever, in thinly disguised promises of allowing access to your movies all the time. Sadly, without an actual internet connection, this is not the case, and after 2014, the switch gets turned off and that's gone too. Best news? Handbrake can rip a beautiful copy for you easily and allow you to use it where you want. If these movie companies want to show they care, they will release products in all formats, not just these locked down ones. iTunes has restrictions, but at least I can watch a movie when and where I want. Didn't buy the last Harry Potter films for the same reason."
2,The Dark Knight Rises,"I downloaded rental so that I could watch on an airplane while traveling. It worked before take off then while in the air it showed ""Download error"". Needless to say, never was able to watch, since it needed to be viewed in 48 hours."
1,Top 5 worst movies of all time,This was awful. I was looking forward to a spectacular movie and this was a huge disappointment. Time to close the book on the Batman's made only to fatten wallets in Hollywood. I would rate it less than 1 star if I could.
3,okay,just okay hard to hear all the wordshate when they make movies that are hard to hear and thus follow
3,It was ok,It was a good movie.i expected a little more out of it.but deff worth watching once.another batman all that needs to be said
2,Snoozers,"I found this installment to be over-hyped, too long, and easily forgettable. I did not like Bane and found him to be rather excruciating to look at and listen to. Actually, he reminded me of a villian that would have been more appropriate on the set of the 1981 movie, Road Warrior. The story was unnecessarily complex, which added to it not be worth my interest. I apologize...I found nothing that I liked about this movie...even the special effects were nothing new or unique. I am not a Batman aficionado; therefore, this may be the reason I found nothing interesting or redeeming about this movie."
2,boring,boring movie. has story but direction is not good as previous batman movies. not much action. villain is highlight of movie.good thing I waited to see movie as rental than theater.
3,it's alright,"the acting was good,story was good, a couple of holesthe movie lighting is too darkthe bat toys were cool"
4,Merry Christmas,What a great Christmas gift! My brother was very excited to receive it! This product was shipped to me in plenty of time before Christmas!
3,not too impressed,"I know everyone loves this film, but we found it very difficult to follow. Reviewing the previous films might help. Also, the music track overwhelmed the voices which was very annoying and contributed to the confusion. WHY do film makers run the music so loud???"
3,Does Dick Cheney write this stuff?,"Anne Hathaway is excellent, as always; Michael Caine is a washout, stop whinging.Need to see the baddies face to fear him, otherwise he's just another cartoonPrison stuff was out of Midnight Express, and Liam Neeson came back for an earner.Didn't see the Robin character coming until we were told about itOther stuff is pretty much as usual.Did you think the 'eight years of enforced silence' was a reference to Obama? George (or Dick) forced into internal exile, the public beguiled by brittle peace? (hey, never mind the recession). The 9-11 references were so explicit, it was quite uncomfortable.Against all my prejudices, I liked it a lot, must be all the cool toys"
1,Amazon Video Stinks!!!,"This movie was so so. They tried to hard to one up the Dark Knight. Too much info, slow action to develop.I still enjoyed it but I liked the Dark Knight better.This was my first purchase on Amazon Video and it was AWFUL!!I purchased the HD version and it kept buffering saying my connection was too slow (Not the case because I have a 18 mbs connection). Netflix and Hulu work fine on my PS3 so I am blaming it on Amazon.The quality of the movie was downgraded and it was still buffering. I watched the movie in standard definition and clinking the continue button every 2 mns.I will be buying my on line streams somewhere else until this is fixed."
1,UNFORTUNATE LET DOWN !,"I WAS READY FOR IT TO BE OVER LOOOOOONG BEFORE IT WAS!NEEDED MORE TWO FACE, LESS BANE OF MY EXSITANCE!"
2,Missing the actual MOVIE!!,"I pre-ordered this a few days before it went OOS, so I felt lucky. Well, I had no luck when it arrived today. It was missing the movie on blu-ray. I ended up with 2 Special Edition discs and 1 dvd disc! Of course there are none in stock and didn't want to wait till Amazon got them back in stock (if ever), so I had to send back for a refund and wait 2 more days for the standard edition to arrive."
1,Worst batman ever!,not only was it slow in the plot line but really? did you you really think robin would know right away who batman was?
1,Great Movie; TERRIBLE CONDITION,"I'm not real clear as to whether we're to rate the general item or the condition it arrives in. If you want to know the condition - the sliding cover came chewed up and the plastic case was cracked all over. Otherwise, it was a fantastic movie."
3,The whole dark knight thing has gotten old.,"This franchise needs to die. The earlier movies with Robin with Chris ODonnel were much better. It keeps getting darker and darker - too violent for the kids. Whatever happened to comics for the kids? Now that they are cashing in on the comics for adults as movies, forget the kids."
3,Not the worst Batman,But definitely not the best. The visuals were pretty good and of course the gadgets were pretty cool but the audio was horrible. I hate it when the music is so loud you can't hear the dialogue.And speaking of the dialogue. Some of the lines must have been written by grade school bullies.
3,30 minutes too long,Plenty of special effects. Bale is not my favorite Batman. Too sullen. Not fun to watch. Hathway was a good Catwoman.
3,Issue with the Blu-Ray framing,"I don't know if others are seeing the same problems on their HD tvs, but when I use the sub-title format... I am getting a video that switches btw full screen and widescreen ( with those two black bars on the top and bottom of the screen )..I don't know if that is a defect with the production of this movie onto disc..Anyone else see that same problem?"
1,Sucked hard,"You're reading these reviews because you're unsure you want to see this, read no further. It sucked. The other ones were good this one totally sucked. I was really surprised, I thought maybe I'd be underwhelmed but it was worse. Bad story, no character development, the logic even within the world of superhero movies is pushed too far. I was just pissed. Anne Hathaway was very sexy, I think she's very pretty but rarely a sexy character. If you want to spend 2:45 minutes watching her dressed like the girl in the T-Mobile commercial and being a fox then you might like this.Bye"
1,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BATMAN FILM EVER!!!,"OH MY GOODNESS!!! Seriously, all the good reviews about this movie, have got to be kidding me. The movie was basically about how wimpy batman is, and does not show Batman of who he truly is. The villains voice is ridiculous and annoyed me the ENTIRE TIME, not to mention he was this super being that knew EVERYTHING there is to know about EVERYTHING, and how he could take a punch no matter what. Just horrible film all around, thank goodness we only rented it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,"Beware of so-called ""Digital"" copy from UV","The Ultraviolet ""Digital"" copy is not compatible with the iTunes library. In order to use it you must first download the Flixter app which does not work correctly on the apple devices. This means that if you have an apple device, you now have to keep 2 libraries. The claim that this is a digital copy that works on iPhone and iPad is very misleading and extremely frustrating. If, like me, you go out of your way to buy a blu-ray with ""digital"" copy so that you can put it on an iPad, don't bother with this great movie."
1,"Digital copy is a lie, requires crappy app","I typically don't buy blueray, but when I can get the physical version with the digital copy included for the same price it's should be a no brainer. If you're like me and prefer digital copies of movies, you may want to skip this buy.Turns out this ""digital copy"" doesn't actually provide a copy at all! Rather, it forces you to download a spammy app from Flixster, giving you a copy of the video that you can only use with that. You want to use your iTV to stream it from your computer? Too bad for you! Maybe you like managing which videos are on your iPad from the same interface- not so here, what you download and store is completely separate! You can probably take a guess what will happen when the authentication servers for the app go offline.So go to iTunes and buy it there, or spend your money here and then torrent a copy that doesn't include ridiculous DRM and other stupidity, but don't waste your money on this scam."
1,Do Not Purchase,"Product not properly mixed for sound or picture, for example; home theater setting with a set sound level - during action scenes the sound is deafening while on dialogue scenes sound is too low to discern dialogue. For picture - the size shifts many times from full screen to wide screen with the black bars displayed. Most annoying. This is a replacement as the first DVD had the same problems. Poor editing and mixing. Not recommended. Review is for Blu-ray DVD, have not used regular DVD.Update. Review was too kind. This is a knockoff, has to be a counterfeit as no established studio would market a video with the lack of video and sound mixing this dvd has."
1,Don't waste your money,"Same old, same old. Nothing new...even the special effects where things we've seen before. They need to put some more effort into creating original content."
4,Good Flick,As long as you know the previous stories you will like this. Like the prospectsof the continuing saga. Great acting by Bale.
2,Where's batman?,"I had high hopes and was disappointed. Batman is hardly in the movie and when he is, his fight scenes are really weak!!"
4,"Good movie plots, but not too much excitement","Even thought this movie does not have too much excitement and well knit content, I would still recommend this title to batman fans."
3,It's OK,"I liked the first Dark Knight better, but the new tech was pretty cool in comparison to the other videos."
3,This movie is OK,"I think the plot was very average, I felt the movie was not complete, it is setting up for new characters and a new franchise.I wish them all the luck and maybe a better action movie."
3,Rounds out the series,"I wasn't as taken by The Dark Knight Rises as I was the first two. In my opinion, the reason for Bruce Wayne's depression and his conflict with Alfred is not well-done, nor is Wayne's attraction to Cat Woman. Too many lapses, too many explosions, and Alfred's dream of seeing Bruce Wayne with the love of his life at an outdoor bar is cheesy."
5,Love it!,We love watching this movie at home. It never gets old and I can't wait to watch it over and over again.
4,Good way to end the series,"This movie did not have as much actual ""Batman"" footage as we expected, but it turned out to be a well-written way to conclude the trilogy."
5,Solid finish to the series,"If you liked the last 2 movies, youwont be dissapointed with the Dark Knight Rises! Wish it wasnt over but all good things do."
4,Ultraviolet BS,"Just a quick note about how good Dark Knight Rises was the second time, this time at home on blu ray where more details and the behind the scenes content really added so much more to the experience.The only reason I give the product one star less is this dropping of the more universal iTunes digital copy version for this clunky and complicated UV digital version that isn't really a digital version of your own, as I understand it. It's a crappy and misleading selling point that was very disappointing and I can't really use it conveniently like the previous iTunes digital add-ons to buying the blu ray.We all know the movie industry will do anything they can to make a buck from the masses, but this UV corral they're herding us into is crappy.Well-thought-out and executed final chapter of the Nolan style Batman trilogy. I have a feeling they'll be teaching classes on it as ""modern great literature as film"" at Berkeley within the decade. :)"
3,Batman,"it's a good movie but fails to live upto the previous 2 movies, if your a big fan it is a must see."
3,A fair conclusion to the series,"It was a good action movie, but it did not meet my expectations. I was dissapointed with the story behind the villain Bane, but I wont get into details, I'm just really glad I chose not to spend extra money at the theaters to watch it- because I know I would have been a bit more dissapointed."
1,Ultra Violet?,"I recommend against buying this version. After contacting Flixter customer service I was informed that there is NO iTunes version for this offer. In other words the studios that own Flixter have created a service that is not compatible with any smart television service (iTunes, Roku, etc.). The digital copy is rights locked and only playable through a Flixter account. That means if you want to play your digital copy on your smart phone or tablet you can only do it through a Flixter app, and there is NO watching it on your Apple TV or other smart TV device."
1,ultraviolet digital copy is a piece of crap,"first off this review is not about the dark kinght rises, it is about the ultraviolet digital copy.the blue-ray dvd combo promises a digital copy for us to download into our computer but what it didn't tell you that you downloading more than what you want.you have to make two account on two different websites and by the time you get to the download part it have yo download another program and the worst part is thatyou still don't get a digital copy in your computer.ul;traviolet is crap and if you want a digital copy for yoruself buy it in either itunes or burn the dvd."
1,UltraViolet SUCKS!!!!!!!,"I don't know why Warner Brothers is insisting on being anti consumer with this stupid UltraViolet stuff. No watching Dark Knight Rises on my Apple TV, or any other apple devices without an internet connection. I refuse to use Flixster and put myself at the mercy of their license termination. Either rip the movie, or just get it from iTunes."
1,dark knight,"Sucked, effects were lame. Time to retire batman until u can him justice. Waste of time! Boo boo boo boo"
1,Overrated,Too much hype and overrated. There's nothing else I could say about this movie. Just rent it if you really want to see it. Don't buy it!!
2,Batman movie was so and so,"I am really a fan of Batman movies, except this one. Didn't care for it. The story was not that great and it didn't keep me interested. Sorry but this one bomb out for me."
4,wraps it up nicely,"Had to see it twice, but then it all came together. A good wrap up that leaves some openings for a new generation."
1,VHS VERSION?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (blue-raise) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (virtual house service)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BRs or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it sooo hard on home media!"
1,Pathetic,"Ultraviolet is horrendous. If I don't get a free digital copy that works with iTunes, then I ain't buying. Go to Hades WB! Worst movie of the bunch anyway...."
1,The Dark Knight Rises: Limited Edition Bat Cowl for 350.00 ?,$350.00 I don't think so you you have got to be the biggest jerk to to put that kind of price for something that just came out this week.
1,Ultraviolet SUCKS!!!,I loved this movie!! Ultraviolet is crap though....worthless. Such a waste that the ending to this great trilogy gets released on such a POS thing like Ultraviolet.
5,The Dark Knight Rises,Best Batman movie I've seen yet. Can't wait for the next one. I bet the next one will have Robin in it.
4,Entertaining,"Lots of action and intrigue. I like the twist at the end. I loved the new tech in it and in this day and age we need some ""good triumphs evil."""
2,"great movie, poor quality","i got this digital download to try out the service, it of course uses DRM but the real problem is the overall quality of play back, the colors are muted and all wrong as if it had a very low contrast ratio. I would recommend getting a hard copy, dvd or bluray instead of digital"
5,Great Movie!,"A great end to the Dark Knight Saga. Not as many action sequences as the other movies in this series, but with a solid story line this movie still captivated me and my wife."
5,Great movie,We absolutely loved this movie. Not as dark as the previous Dark Knight movie. I would highly recommend this. We did have a problem with the streaming in the middle. We simply restarted the movie and it started and continued from where we left off without an issue. Probably our system issue not Amazon.
4,Great Deal,"Great package! I always have to buy the movie with a digital copy nowadays and it honestly should become the standard. I'm so glad this set includes it as well as the Blu-Ray and DVD. As for the movie, you know its awesome and lives up to the quality of any Christopher Nolan film."
3,Entertaining because of the action,But it seemed like this story has been stretched far enough. I feel like I have seen this plot many times in earlier movies. It was just ok for me.
4,Multiple sub-plots and action-packed scenes,Dark Knight Rises was woven with many sub-plots and intertwining stories that kept the mind active and the heart pumping with action packed scenes. Grandmothers would enjoy t more if there were captions for the hearing impaired.
5,Awesome Film,Movie is a great ending to the greatest superhero saga of all time. The film is fairly complicated with plenty of small pieces of dialogue paying off at the end.
3,Another bit of the old ultra violence,"Tedious riff on a comic book character. Anne Hathaway is good. Christian Bale, was, well, Christian Bale. Reminded me of Escape from New York, but not as entertaining."
2,This ain't The Batman,Disapointing. No way around saying that. Bruce Wayne is now a victim of his own success and does not see himself as a good man anymore. And considering he is acting like a sissy - he may be right. Don't see this story line continuing.
5,Best Batman in this series yet !!!!,"Another awsome movie in the Caped Crusader saga , awsome chases, lots of action , new Bat toys, with a surprise or 2 towards the end !!!!!"
3,Christmas gift. I hope I can borrow it.,Christmas gift. I hope I can borrow it. Only disappointment is that I'm in Canada and that the UV digital copy only works in USA.This makes the point of buying it if you're Canadian...if you want the digital copy...redundant. Too bad...no more paying more for a digital UV copy for me.
5,Limited Edition Going Fast,"I just got mine, 17,702 of 35,000 and it looks great.I've been a fan of Batman since I was a child, I am 58 years old now.It just goes to show how something good can last a lifetimeI have been waiting on this for a what seems an eternity.When it was first advertized I wanted one but they were postponed.When I saw the Pre-order come up I got in line and I am glad I did.Hang on to them folks, it is a good bet they will only go up in value when they are sold out.Most likely, by the end of the day if not already as of this review.YES!!!"
4,A great end to this great trilogy,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a beautiful, dark ending to his famous trilogy. While some Batman fans seemed frustrated by the way the film ends, I wasn't. This film is fantastic. The soundtrack is the first part of the film that stands out. It complements the action on screen perfectly. The film has four Academy Award winners acting in it, and it shows on-screen. Bale, Caine, Cotillard, and Freeman are all fantastic, as well as the other members of the cast, which include two Oscar nominees in Anne Hathaway and Gary Oldman. Tom Hardy is frighteningly scary as Bane. The film editing and cinematography work well together as they do in all of Nolan's films. This is just a great action movie."
5,Best Bat Man Movie to Date,This was the best Batman series to date with lots of action and interesting twists. Hard to tell who was the real villain. Liked the ending.
3,It was ok I guess,It was ok to me I think it was not better than the last Batman I seen with the Joker compare to that ill give it 3 1/2 stars for the effort ..
3,A good movie,I liked the move. Some of it was a little painful to watch as I don't believe these movies are just fiction and fantasy anymore. I am not sure if art is imitating life or vice versus. There were a few surprises and I really liked the performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
5,Excellent movie,"Dark as usual, but the main character still has demons to overcome. It takes a junior police officer who grew up under the same circumstances as Bruce Wayne to bring Wayne out of his funk and bring the Batman back to life; to make him believe again.If you like action (The Unit, Breaking Bad) this movie will draw you in, make you identify with the characters and then put you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll."
2,Eh,Good movie. I really did not like the ending seemed so out of character for Bruce Wayne at the end. I didn't really care for the characterization of bane
5,Best collector's item!,"1st off, its not as big as it looks in the picture but still its just brilliant!!I'm totally happy buying this especially when i got to for $39.99, for some reason i checked the price the very next day of me buying it and it was selling for close to $70/-"
3,Not that good,"It took me probably about seven months after the movie came out to finally see it, and I'm just not that impressed, I didn't think it was great."
2,Pure dribble,"I am shocked at how much this movie sucked The script sounded as if it were written by a third grader, trite and predictable. Did every word out of cat woman's mouth have to be a sexual innuendo? It was pure dribble..."
2,Too bad I have to spend $15 on iTunes for a real DC!,Love the movie...hate Ultra Violet FAKE digital copy. If this wasn't a new age classic I would have skipped buying because of UV!
1,movie,I had five people over for New Year's day and four of the five of us fell asleep in this movie. It was slow with clunky dialogue that did not flow well from scene to scene. Regret wasting my time on this one.
3,Disappointed,"I actually felt disappointed with this movie. Sure the action was there, but it just fell flat for me. Like they were trying to hard to wrap up too many story plot points, instead of exploring Batman's character like the first 2."
5,Can't Go Wrong With Batman,"Picky movie-goers complained that this film didn't live up to it's predecessors, but as a whole this film wraps up the trilogy and ends the franchise at a high point. Nolan pumped out another great film."
3,OK for a Batman movie,"The writers and directors were obviously striving for the ""real-life"" tone to the film. Some of us feel the point of a super hero is the feeling of him being ""Super""...I do enjoy Christian Bale as an actor the telling seemed flat to me. Many of us have followed Batman from the beginning...the portrayal of Bane was weak. The lack of a back story for Catwoman...also left a lot to be desired.Will you see it if you are a super hero fan...yes. Will I add it to my collection of purchased...no."
5,Best one yet,Great movie and even better finale to the trilogy. It really brings all aspects of the three movies together. The musical score of this film is outstanding as well. Well rounded film!
4,Another installment of the best Batman series EVER!,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars was due to the significant shelf wear present on an item that was brand new. Makes me wonder if was re-sealed before delivery. (the product came from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon).I have seen most of the previous Batman movies and was not that impressed. Especially with the Batman character being played by different actors as it went along. Very disconcerting. This trilogy is the benchmark for classic comic heroes brought to the big screen. All the others should be judged by this trilogy, IMHO. (your opinion may vary, but that is your right)."
5,Can someone please tell me if it has a subtitle option?,"I have trouble understanding Michael Cane at times, and also Bane... This would make me enjoy the movie even further."
5,Amazing!,As much as I loved The Dark Knight...this one tops it! Simply amazing!! There are not enough words to say about how outstanding this film truly was...I loved every minute of it!!
4,"Good, not Great.",I enjoyed the acting but the story was predictable and overly done. There was one or two unpredictable twists in it to make it entertaining enough for me not to notice the length.
3,My least favorite of the trilogy,"This was an alright movie, but as one other reviewer has pointed out, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. The injury subplot in the beginning seems crafted out of thin air just to have something that Bruce has to fight to overcome. The villains, too, seem much less alive and fleshed-out than previous installments, even if you disregard Ledger's performance of The Joker.There were a couple twists at the end that were good enough to draw my interest back, and it was entertaining, but not the exit I'd liked to have seen for this series."
2,Dumb,Too many dumb one-liners. Overacting. I didn't care about the characters. Villan was hard to understand. Too much reliance upon special effects rather than developing characters and plot.
2,"slow, stalled",i watched it several times and all of the times it stalled then fast fowarded (missing minutes of the movie and having to rewind to see it)not a good experience.
5,Just Wondering,Why does it say 2 disc's come with it but in the picture there's 3? I know there's a 3 disc version but I want this one with the cowl I think it looks cool I just hope it's come's with 3 disc not 2. Has anyone else noticed what i'm talking about?
4,Nolan Not At His Best,This proves a point that Nolan at his not-so-best is still better than most of the other directors.Very entertaining movie. But Mr. Nolan we need you to put in more effort. Please!
1,What an uninteresting movie!,"The best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes, however, I don't think that was interesting enough to redeem the rest of it. The production quality was awful. It was hard to hear the low-talking dialogue over the background music. The villian was uninteresting and boring. Overall, just very dull script writing. The movie was very long and so much of it could have been cut out to make it shorter and therefore, less painful to sit through."
2,Major disappointment.,A self-contradictory mess of inconsistent character origins and agendas which managed to waste the extraordinary potential of this story. Its mediocrity has haunted me for weeks now; I wish that I had never seen it.
1,did not like at all,"my title says it all, this movie made no sense, anne hathaway sucks as cat woman, and worst batman movie ever in my opinion"
1,What a poorly written film.,"This film stinks of Hollywood rushing the whole way through. A poorly constructed, terribly written, mess of a blockbuster. It does not hold up and shames the second film in the series. What a lazy finale. So disappointing."
2,"super boring, depressing, and heartless. Was rooting for Bane towards the end.","Why keep Gotham around? The movie once again threatened Gotham with it's destruction, snore... I found myself really just completely bored with the whole concept. The pace was slow, the story uninteresting, the characters worn out...The biggest mistake from my perspective was the breaking of the invisible boundries of Gotham, I realize the previous movies also did this, but I still felt like Gotham was somehow isolated from the rest of the world in the first 2... I lost that feeling here and it really broke the Batman mytique for me.Bane's voice is incredibly annoying."
3,"OK, but letdown.","Stylish and atmospheric, but without great storyline of Batman Begins. Also, overly long and dragged at times. Overall, entertaining film."
5,The Finale that you have to see,"Watching this movie, you will be happy to know that Christopher Nolan saved the best for last. Christian Bale is solid again as Batman, but Anne Hathaway steals the show followed by closely by Tom Hardy."
3,The Dark Knight Occasionally Rises,"Writer-director Christopher Nolan's ambitious conclusion to his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy suffers from an unwieldy script, a disappointing villain and not enough Batman for its 164-minute running time. On the plus side, Anne Hathaway rises to the occasion as Catwoman. No match for ""The Dark Knight"" - let alone the Tim Burton installments - but visually impressive and fitfully entertaining."
3,IT was good,It was good but nothing compares to the Dark Knight. I can't believe people think this movie is comparable. Don't recommend.
3,Rising tedium...,"Ugh. This film was weak in all areas except special effects which is/are the ""star"". It all starts and ends with a tedious script and storyline. Can't do much if the writing has no wit etc. The main bad guy, Bane, is just boring, especially his annoying Darth Vader voice/Hannibal rip off mask etc., These guys shouldn't talk a lot but this one does. The good/bad girl is hot of course, and possibly the best acting with weak lines. Nolan, normally superb, is equally flat and his bad boy voice is just as annoying as Bane's. One of those films you might play in the background while dusting ir whatever. What a waste of, no matter doubt, millions of dollars."
3,movie was too long and did not like the story,movie was too long and did not like the story. Good thing I did not see it in the theater.
5,Great film,"Really great film, and a perfect end to a great trilogy. It rewards the viewer with multiple views. Ignore the bad reviews, as most are only in response to the Ultra-Violet quality and not the film itself."
5,Epic,"One heck of a movie. Should absolutely be on your ""must see"" list. Great plot. Great action. Wish I had seen it in theaters."
4,The Dark Knight Rises,i got this today. it looks very good. i seen clips on youtube. i got all the other batman movies
4,DKR review,"This movies typically reflects Nolan's film style, which blends nicely with Batman's story and identity. The only complaint I'd have is that the movie took itself too seriously, never remembering its comic book origins, or even interspersing the tragic storyline with spurts of comedic or romantic moments. Other than that I was engrossed throughout the movie, and would recommend this movie strongly to others.It'll send a shiver down your spine the first time you hear:I AM GOTHAM'S RECKONING!"
3,Drawn out,Begining and end good but not enough Batman and toys in the middle. To much plot and not enough action. Worth watching but not owning.
3,It's alright,Batman is a little wimpy in this one! They should have called this one Catwoman. She did most of the fighting.
3,Good Film Drags at Times,"This film was entertaining, with impressive action sequences and a generally worth watching. That said, elements of the story line were poorly explained (including the motivation for being evil) and the whole thing was about half an hour too long."
2,"I love most of the batman movies, but this one was kind of a sleeper. not much action not much plot...","It felt like they really tried to drag this movie out, it was slow the plot wasn't particularly good, the bad guy voice was over the top, it reminded me of the bat man with Arnold, its a bat man so I watched it... I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, but wouldn't discourage someone from seeing it..."
3,Good not Great!,"This movie was Good, but it wasn't great! O f the three movie with Christian Bale this story was not the best. By far not the best.The acting was fine but it seems like they ran out of story and then started throwing things in there to fill time.Another bomb going off,gotta get it out of here movie. Come on, the writers can't think of anything better than that!"
2,moves top slow,Rented for 48 hours...feel asleep the first night. ThoughtI was just tired. Tried watching again the second night feel asleep again. Moves too slow.
2,Dark Night,"Weak plot, too dark to see much, really a kids movie. I am sure I would have loved it if I was 10!"
3,Batman swoops... but downward !,Movie was too long and had tedious storyline and tended to drag in the the middle for about 30 minutes. Some of the characters accents into English very hard to discern what they were saying.
3,Hmm,"I guess after the last movie, I expected more. I mean, even by comic book standards, this movie didn't make a lot of sense and took a long time to get there."
3,Evil Nearly Triumphs,"I'm no movie critic but I know what I like. The ""evilness"" begins at the beginning and continues almost to the end. There was no light at the end of the tunnel...until. So for me, it was too much bad, even for a fantasy. If you are like me and need a little bit of good to show through you probably won't like it much more than I did. The story was interesting but certainly fantastic. (aren't they all). I thought the acting was pretty good and the characters played the roles as one would expect. But hey, I'm no movie critic, I just did't love it."
3,it's just okay,i wasn't impressed with this movie. Somehow this move was so predictable to me. Maybe the next one will be better.
3,Not the best of the Trilogy But good!,"Bats is at it again saving Gotham. This is a must see for the Batman enthusiast.. I wish it would have had a ""nod"" to the ""rumored"" Justice League movie(s) This is the last time (we are told) that Christian Bale will done the Cape and Cowl."
5,Brand New and Quick Delivery!,"I love this movie and just had to own, was so glad that it comes with the ultraviolet copy. And VERY happy that it came in very quick time!"
2,It was an ok movie,The movie is quite disappointing. I expected more as the plot was a bit dry and uninteresting from the 15 minutes onward. This clearly is a backward step from the previous installment.
2,sound level sucks,"The sound level was very poor, whether the fault of the actual movie or the transmission, I don't know. I had to increase the sound level on my T.V. to 50%. I normally listen to T.V. broadcasts @ 25%"
2,What?!?,"This movie was long, long, long. And the illogical and convoluted plot lines really got on my nerves. And the speeches! So many speeches!"
2,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed with this film that I felt I had to write a review. As a big fan of this Batman series, I greatly anticipated the release of Dark Knight Rises. This movie, however, did not measure up to the others. The plot line was not compelling, the pace was not exciting. The villain was pretty lame and Batman against the villain was pretty lame. The Anne Hathaway Christian Bale matchup was lackluster as there was no chemistry between the two actors. The movie was long and it felt it. Of course, you will watch this to see the conclusion of the trilogy, just don't go in with high expectations for an exciting and nail biting conclusion."
1,The Dark Knight Rises,"Terrible story, Lousy acting. Stupid ending. How do you get stabbed on the side and walk away, fly a helicopter out to sea and survive a nuclear blast? The heat alone would fry you."
2,Too slow...builds up to a big let down,After 2 great movies this movie ends up being a real let down. Way too slow and over dramatic.Such great potential too!
2,dissapointing,dissapointing. was expecting better. glad i didn't spend money on a movie ticket and it only cost me $1.99 Raquel
2,Underwhelmed,Underwhelming. Despite that: Bale is still awesome. Not worth the wait. They def left room for a sequel. Robin islame.
3,The Dirge Knight,"I enjoyed the other Dark Knight movies but this one is just a bit long and disjointed, with some serious time, continuity and pacing issues. I get the impression Nolan had a million things he wanted to do with the Bat, but couldn't quite figure out how to squeeze them all into one movie. There are some great scenes but I found myself checking my watch quite a bit and I was glad when it was finally done."
3,Fairly Good Movie,"This movie was not as good as the previous movie. It would be hard to be the Joker played by Heath Ledger. That was in part what made that movie so good. But all in all, this movie is still a fairly good movie."
3,Never really got good,"This movie has great special effects, but it is far too long with no real story line. Predictible and never really got me involved."
3,review og dark knight rises,"was slow and acting is fair, looooong cat woman being good? wrong set up for robin BUT better that nothing and bat man was sick (not cool but should have died) NEXT!!"
3,Decent flick,Overall it was a very good movie but it left a lot to be desired. The 1st Dark Knight movie was very entertaining and so was this 1. What the 1st movie lacked that this 1 was chock full of was cheese factor. Who decided to make Bane sound like Jiminy Cricket?
2,"Too long, and unbelievable plot developments compared to other Dark Knight movies.","I understand that this is a Batman movie, but the plot has some major holes in it that were too unbelievable to not mention. Also, they could have probably cut 45 minutes out of it and it would have been just as good."
1,Terrible download,The movie I enjoyed. The download I didn't. The movie paused many times to the point of timeout. I ordered HD but the picture quality and sound didn't represent such. It was not broadcast in Dolby digital surround sound. I will not be using amazon service for watching movies any longer. I NEVER had this problem with VUDU or even Netflix.
2,Wanted to like it,"Disappointed. Some great action scenes, but not much else to enjoy. Didn't remember Batman's voice being so ridiculously low in the other movies. Couldn't decide if Bane's voice was comical rather than intimidating."
2,"Disjointed plot, too long, No-one will ever equal Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson's characters.","REALLY disappointed after reading the positive reviews. It felt like a real mish-mash of plot lines. Tried too hard, did not succeed. The villian's perfromance was nowhere near the caliber of Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. He sported a ""Silence of the Lambs"" muzzle and a dirty winter coat. Ugh!"
2,Horribe,"Slow, no Batman through most of the movie. Plot really made no sense. I cant begin to tell you how glad this series is over."
2,Not very good,"This final entry in the trilogy was weak. Compared to the second-which would be hard to beat by any measure, this one was just lame. I was very disappointed..."
3,Ponderous and pretentious for a moving comic book,"Pretty ponderous and pretentious for a moving comic book, but it's at least a half-star better than the awful and heavy-handed The Dark Knight (2005). Now and then some rousing good action can be found (helped by exciting score) in between the extended, darkly boring scenes reminiscent of the 2005 film. Takes a few cues from Star Wars and Escape from New York as well."
3,Repeating story lines with new levels of violence does not help this time around,"The movie was long (again) while taking its time to develop the plot lines. The villain was not as interesting as the Joker in the Dark Knight, and we rehashed an old plot by an old enemy. The Cat Woman was done well and the character was interesting and entertaining. The setup at the end for another movie in the series will surely keep blogs humming until the next incarnation of the Batman on the big screen. There was excessive violence and killing with little need for it, the story could have been done with less. 3 stars because its always fun to see the Batman on the movie screen, but with the storyline being rehashed from past movies, it did not wow me."
4,A dark movie,It took me a couple of days to watch this movie. As I did I could not help but think about the tragedy that took place when it opened somewhere in the US.It is unfortunate that is has not been nominated for any Oscars as it should have been.The performances of the lead characters in particular Anne Hatthaway and Marion Cotillard as well as Caine and Bale as really superb. Oldman truly embodies the Gordon role and for those who are fans of the Batman comics this is a really good movie. I recommend it but be prepared to watch it in two installments because it is long - can't wait for the next one.
4,Pretty good,"Movie sequels are rarely as good as the originals and this one is no exception. This was such a great series with Bale playing Batman, that it's hard to fault them. But this story was one of summing things up and ending the story so much so, it didn't quite have the same feel as the first two. So, it's a very good movie... just not as good as one or two."
5,VERY GOOD MOVIE,"ME GUSTA SOY FANATICO DE BATMAN Y ME GUSTO MUCHO, LE DI 5 ESTRELLAS POR QUE LA CALIDAD DE IMAGEN EN EXCELENTE Y EL SONIDO TAMBIEN."
2,Video portion was bad,"I liked the movie, but I was disappointed that the movie was not delivered to me in HD. The picture on my HDTV was grainy, much like TV of old. If my next movie from Amazon comes is the same quality, Amazon will lose this part of my business."
4,Good but not as good as the Dark Knight,I like the combo packs. I usually use itunes for my iphone but working with ultraviolet was okay. I like the way the movie worked in several of the Batman characters while keeping it real
3,Kind of a let down,It's got lots of cool action...it's got lots of cool gadets...it's got a really good portrayal of Catwoman (which surprised me)...what it's missing... is BANE... and about 80% of the story...What it has is really good... but I was disappointed in the final product.
2,Not As Good As Others In Batman Series,"This one I found forgettable, kind of like Batman and Robin with George Clooney as Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze. Selina Kyle (AKA Cat Woman) was no where near as convincing as Michele Pfeiffer was in Batman Returns. The problem with this movie is what it has to stand up to and it just missed those lofty goals. Casting missed the bad guy and girl target on this one..."
3,Average,"Not bad for the eight or ninth movie. Even though there were a million comic books, you can only make so many movies"
3,I may have to revisit this movie...,"My first impression upon watching the final installment of Nolan's Batman Trilogy was that the pacing was little slow and the story a bit bloated. I really wanted to love this movie, since I greatly enjoyed the first 2, but either I wasn't in the mood or it just didn't click with me. A couple months down the road I will give it another shot, maybe via priming it with the first 2 movies again.Cheers!"
4,Dark knight doesn't disappoint!,After the Dark Knight I really felt that the franchise would have a very hard time living up to expectations. Well folks they didn't disappoint with the Dark Knight Rises! What makes these movies excellent are the villains. The villain perhaps isn't 100% at par with the Joker but is sure damn close! Check it out you won't be disappointed.
4,pretty good,"The movie is pretty good, only complaint is that it is really long and some parts drag on for far too long."
4,Great movie!,"Its the movie expected. Was a great one, but slow moving at times.A lot of great actors in these also. Don't miss it if you have watchedearlier ones."
3,Too dark and violent,I did not enjoy this film but rented it for guests. Too violent and too dark in my opinion. Despite all the action I feel asleep while watching this.
1,"Ok, for a 12 year old","Was expecting an action packed, fun, adventure; I got a long, drawn out melodrama with some explosions and a plot that is about as believable as Alice in Wonderland. I get the whole ""guy in a black hero suit"" thing does not lend itself to believable plots, but this was so corny as to be stupid. What a waste of $5."
2,Better deal out there!,"This is an excellent movie, but don't buy it alone! For $29.96 you can get all 3 films on blue ray, much better deal!"
3,Not even thinking on buying,"This was not my favorite movie from Christopher Nolan, it was boring and predictable. I think the only good acting that I found on the movie was from Michael Caine(Alfred). It is a good movie, but, i did not liked it so i wont be spending my money on it. Now this is me, if you loved it at the theater then buy it and ignore this. I'm giving 3 stars because of the deal for the movie here, but on the movie itself I give it a 2 1/2."
1,ugh.,"This movie was so so horrible. I had such great hopes for it, since the last movie was AWESOME. But, no such luck. It is discombobulated, with a confusing story line."
3,Geed Movie.,"A really well done movie, but a little anti climactic for such an awesome trilogy. Great job from the cast."
5,Great movie!,"I wish I had seen this on the big screen - Christian Bale is in top form for this movie and the conspicuous nature of the plot happening to coincide with the Occupy Wall Street is intriguing. No wonder the Corporate Controlled Media did everything they could to shut OWS down and ignore and promote violent provocateurs, bribe the NYPD with $million ""donations"" from the Banksters .... the .001% should pay attention to this movie. Thank you Mr. Nolan, Bravo! Every moment is an opportunity to choose between Love or Not Love."
1,One star for ultraviolet junk,"This isn't a digital copy, it's an ultraviolet cloud access file, which may charge access fees in the future.One star until Warner Bros includes the option to choose an iTunes copy instead - like Universal blu-rays do!"
3,P.O.S gets 3 stars,one of the best movies of the year. This is cheaply made. Don't wast your money get to standard version.
3,ok but not great,"My family and I went to see ""The Dark Knight Rises"" today. This film is the last part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. I thought the film was ok but not great. The visual effects and acting were decent. The film suffers from being overstuffed with too many characters and a convoluted plot that needed to be shortened."
1,Thumbs down,"This movie was boring. Very little action from Batman, whospent most of the time whining and sore from old age."
1,"Not the worst batman movie ever, but...","The plot was ridiculous even for a comic book movie. Actually even for a comic book. Too many villians. Anne Hathaway is cute and can act, but was badly cast as Catwoman. Bane was ridiculously bad. The whole prison part of the story made no sense. The authorities response to the major portion of the plot made no sense. The interactions between Bruce Wayne and the rest of the characters made no sense. Only one of the surprises had any surprise in it at all and the reveal was pointless and badly written. So, better than Batman and Robin, but not good."
1,UV Sucks - NEVER again!!!,"Love the movie, but I will NEVER again buy one with the horrible UV/Flixster combo. Seriously, step into the nineties and give us a digital copy like so many other movies have done for years. If I had ready any of the 1-star reviews before I bought (and there are MANY), I would not have bought. Lesson learned."
2,meh..,"Batman begins was the best film in this trilogy. Sorry Chris Nolan, this was your worst film so far. The bad photo on the cover depicts the movie exactly. Poorly staged. Unimaginative. Dreary.I hope the next person to take over the Batman character does a better job at depicting this hero."
3,entertainment,There are many scenes in the film I found quite boring in the dialog. The action scenes of course are very exciting while you're glued to the scene absorbing all the action and noise.
5,Great beginning...,... to an epic trilogy. It goes outside the classic stories and leans more on the Miller Gotham universe. Thanks to Nolan and Goyer. Hellacious cast.
4,Not as good as the last one,Not as good as the last one but it was worth the watch. I liked it and I think you'll like it too.
5,A Knight Rises,I purchased to complete by Dark Knight Blu-ray series. I loved it in the the movies and will watch many times over.
3,"Not the greatest, but a decent closer","It was a very entertaining movie, lots of action, Bane was a beast as well. I just couldn't help but giggle at moments of the film. Bale makes an interesting Batman, it's just that that Bat Voice of his got really hilarious at moments in the flim."
3,Certainly not the best Batman,A poor job on the Batman series. I was not really existed about the movie. It just did not have all of the things that make Batman work as a hero.
5,the dark knight rises,"the movies is very enjoyable and fun to watch,not shure if it should been seen by small children it does have a lot of violence and shooting and killing but overall it is well worth the money to but the dvd"
4,Nice end to the Dark Knight series,"The was in excellent condition, and arrived very quickly. You gotta love the prime service. I would recommend this movie if you are a Batman fan. Probably not for small children under probably 8-10."
5,Good film,Lots of action and treats the Batman theme with a new twist and with a somewhat surprise ending. you will enjoy.
1,Why do they have to talk funny when things get serious? It's like sniffing helium to be silly!,"Hated this movie! I remember 20 years' worth of entertaining, sometimes darkly humorous, edgy Batman movies that I've loved. Where did this come from? And really... Batman needs to get over the ""I'm a tough guy so I've got to talk like I have a bad cigar hangover to cover up the Christian Bale lisp"" - and what was it with Bain's voice? All too distracting and not entertaining at all. Seriously, kid climbs out of a pit and becomes World Terror #1 (or #2 - your interpretation)? Morgan Freeman's and Michael Caine's parts were even reduced to gratuitous throwbacks. Ugh! No more, please."
2,Boooooring,"As a fan of the last 2 Batman movies, I was expecting the Dark Knight Rises to be action packed and exciting as the previous 2. Boy was I wrong. The Dark Knight rises is boring and way too long. It's at least an hour too long. Most of the movie has no action and I almost turned it off I was so bored. I was originally sad to hear that Nolan wouldn't be back to direct a 4th Batman movie. After seeing this one, I am now glad this is the end.If you want to see a good Batman movie, go watch Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. Skip this one unless you want to take a nap."
1,Boring and long,"Boring, long, definitely the worst of the series. Not sure what more there is to say about it. See something else!"
3,HAPPY HOLIDAYS,"Some parts of the movie made me confused and sleepy, But the last 30 minutes of the movie got pretty good."
3,Overrated.,"It was okay, but I did't like it as much as the others in the series. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ann Hathaway were nice additions. There was less Batman than you'd expect in a ""Batman"" movie. It was a little long. Plenty of action. I'd still recommend it."
2,slow start,I thought it was very confusing at the beginning. Very slow start to get to the plot of the true story
2,Lackluster plot and acting.,"Tired fist fight between Batman and Bane? It was like watching two homeless guys tire each other out fighting over a park bench, not what you expect for a superhero when every other scene is goons shooting each other.Except for Bane, it seemed like the other actors were phoning it in. While Bane was interesting and the face mask added an initial level of sinister, it seemed to also limit the character."
5,The Dark Knight Rises (Blu-ray/DVD Combo+UltraViolet Digital Copy),I heard The Dark Knight Rises (Blu-ray/DVD Combo+UltraViolet Digital Copy) was a great movie so i bought it. I'm a big Batman fan.
2,Worst modern batman,"Batman vs Obama and the French Revolution.Batman doesn't end, Robin doesn't work without Batman.Batman doesn't sell his house."
3,Not a Steak,"I don't know what it was about this one. Maybe it was the pacing, maybe it was the motivations of the antagonists, or maybe it was just the general concepts, unanswered questions, or slightly rushed ending but I just can't get excited about this film. Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining to watch, and I'm not sorry I rented it. It just felt like it was missing something in comparison to the previous two. I did like how they brought the trilogy full circle and tied it all together with a bitter-sweet ending though.In concluding this review I'd say I like Subway sandwiches, and I really like a full steak dinner with potatoes and red wine. Both have their place and will be dinner from time to time. If the previous movies were juicy porterhouses this movie was more of a sandwich sans pickles."
2,Someone screwed up!,"The bluray disc has a soundtrack flaw. The sound quality dips down too low and then back up to a reasonable volume over and over through out the movie. I returned it at Best Buy, exchanged it for another and the second one had the same problem. Anybody else having this problem. The DVD has a perfect sound quality. The bluray sucks!"
4,Dark Knight Rises streaming rental,"I rented this film in HD and streamed it through my Roku player. I ran into a lot of slowness problems early on (probably due to either my Roku player or my internet connection). After waiting for the Roku to figure out what was going on, it automatically kicked the video into a lower resolution and it played well.Oh by the way, this movie is awesome! :)"
5,Worth seeing for sure,"Great movie - lots of action, good plot, and surprising ending for the Batman movies. Opens the door for the next series which will not include Batman."
4,"great movie, great quality stream",The movie didn't loose anything at home. Still awesome.Not really sure what else to say here so this is filler for the required word count.
1,batman review,"2:45 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Horrible movie, just like the last batsman movie. Even the fight scenes looked stupid. Don't waste your money."
2,Too Long and I paused the movie twice which is no good,If I look at my watch once that is not good. Twice...means that the movie is not keeping my interest and that I will not watch it a second time or buy it. I paused the movie twice which is the same thing.It doesn't keep my interest like the first two in the series. I loved Cat Woman but her actions surprised me.If you are thinking of buying then I strongly suggest you rent the movie first. If you are thinking of renting then wait for it to come down in price or go to redbox when it comes out.This is disappointing but I am very glad I didn't pay full price in the theaters or buy it online.My prediction is that this will be a $5 dollar DVD in about 3 - 4 months....say March or April of 2013.
1,Ultraviolet makes this version a show stopper,"I also don't buy any DVD/Blu-ray which aren't compatible with my apple products, specifically my apple TVs and with airplay and iCloud delivering the stream to my mobile and TVs there's just no good reason to complicate my life with Ultraviolet."
4,Solid Flick,"Good movie, very entertaining, very hollywood.Loved Bane, he made the movie for me, thought his voice was hilarious.This one, like the last batman was way too long. Caught a quick nap in the middle of it and woke up for the end. Didn't feel like I missed anything."
1,Hated the ending,What the heck! Why would they end Bruce Wayne as Batman. I would not recommend this to anyone who likes Bruce as Batman
1,UV You've got to be joking,"Sorry, I'm not going to waste $$ For a UV copy that is not portable.. Bring back a true digital copy !"
1,UV Copy - Another NO BUY,Quit pushing the UV digital copy crap on us. Another movie I would buy if it had the standard digital download. I will spend my money on other movies.
1,Not another UltraViolet movie....,"This is a great movie, but I will not be purchasing the Blu-ray just for the simple fact that it only comes with an UltraViolet Digital Copy. That format is completely useless if you are trying to watch a movie on a plane or somewhere where you do not have an internet connection. I want to watch my movie when I choose and will purchase this directly from iTunes which will allow me to do that."
4,Great movie,This movie was really good a little long for my husband but perfect for me. I feel like the movie put a lot of effort on the story and not just the action. I'm the only female in my house of 5 even the fish is male so a little more story was good for me.Great job.
5,One of the best movies of the year,"Aside from the Avengers, this movie does a very good job in movie work. Bane is that fearless villain that will do anything to get what he wants.I even find this better than both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (both of which I also own). The storyline is especially one to pay attention to because it relies HEAVILY on Batman Begins. You should know who Ra's Al Ghul is before watching or re-watching because only then will it make sense.Such a great movie series and a great movie to end it all."
2,The Dark Knight Rises,"I would not have purchased this movie if I had been aware of the aspect ratio shifts, with about half the movie being shot in 1.85:1 and the rest in 2.35:1. I have a 96"" 2.35:1 screen, so I had to watch the movie with the 2.35:1 scenes reduced to 66% of the normal picture area to keep the 1.85:1 scenes within the screen dimensions. Whoever thought it was a good idea to shoot a movie this way should never be allowed to make another movie. Also, the audio volume of the 1.85:1 scenes was significantly higher than the 2.35:1 scenes, necessitating large sound level adjustments with every aspect ratio change. I enjoyed the movie for content, but I was extremely disappointed in the technical presentation."
2,Mediocre at best,"Very long film (2.45 hrs) which seemed alot longer because of long stretches of tedious non-action, boring plot and the fact that Batman and Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) were seldom on the screen for the 1st half of film. Hathaway was only ok and that disappointed. Was glad when film finally ended."
2,Jumps around without any bridging shots.,"This was just too over-the-top, and reminded me of the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, where the romantic female turns out to be the villain. Except the Bond film was fun to watch, and this one just draaaaagggged."
4,dark night was fantastic.,"Movie was great and everyone enjoyed it. Picture quality could have been better for ""HD"". You might want to get the Blue Ray if you are watching on a large screen."
4,Great movie,I streamed it via Roku. Great movie. When is amazon going to provide close caption options in this platform. It seems discriminatory to me that they will not provide such a service for the hearing impaired.
3,A little long,The overall story was a little weak & some of it could have been left out such as the Bane back story. I wasn't quite sure why he felt Gotham needed to be destroyed.
4,Pretty good,"Bane was difficult to understand and so it took a little work to follow the story. I wish Batman had been a little more present in the movie. But other than that, it was quite good."
5,"Great ""Ending"" to the Trilogy","This movie is great conclusion to the Batman Begins series! It is definitely worth seeing the other movies somewhat prior to watching this finale as a plot refresher, but other than that, a very well-done film."
1,Fake Blu-ray,"This is a fake Blu-ray. It is terrible quality. If it says made in Mexico on the back, send it back."
2,Surprisingly bad,"I was shocked how bad this was. All of Christopher Nolan's films are so carefully constructed, but this so sloppy. It was incoherent and didn't make much sense, with plot holes you drive a truck through. And you have a 2:45 Batman movie when Batman is on screen maybe 30 minutes, and half of that getting his butt kicked. And that ridiculous dubbing of Bane's voice. You couldn't understand him half the time. I kept waiting for the film to be over."
2,"Beware The ""Digital Copy""","The digital copy is no better than a farce. You are REQUIRED to activate a Flixster account to add the digital copy to your secondary UV account. You cannot bypass it and at that point you're just stuck. Considering this essentially a bait and switch... ""get your UV digital copy...oh no wait it goes through flixster""The Blu-Ray copy as expected is of fine quality and there's no arguing the quality of the movie itself. Hero hits the bad streak, but then climbs back to make a stand. Too bad you won't see it digitally on your mobile device."
2,brief review,"Opinion:The plot had some interesting ideas but none of them were implemented well enough to matter. The acting was bad throughout except for Bane and the young cop, which is odd since you couldn't see most of Bane's face; I guess the voice acting and mannerisms are what sold it. The action scenes were poorly choreographed, directed, performed and edited. At the very least I had expected the action to be good. I was thoroughly bored the entire time."
1,Vapid; not for viewers over age 20.,"This movie has works hard to maintain the sense of astonishment and despair at the power of evil. But the only tools left seem to be explosions and betrayal. The betrayal by Batman's lover and the heroism of Batman's burglar are not credible. So unless you are fascinated by explosions, this movie is stupid."
1,bad,"this movie was bad, full of plot hole. not worth $3.99 to rent. just wait until it plays for free on spike or something.."
3,Synthetic release date,"Great movie, too bad pirating it before I pay money to own it is something that I dont like doing, however studios refuse to release to all markets at the same time. Really, I shouldnt even buy the disk until its in the $5 bin, but I'll have it when I get back from my trip."
1,Oh what's that sucking sound... This,"movie. Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Red Skull were SO much better. The animated series were better than this. The Plot holes, with lack of acting, the lack of physics were detracting... what was the rest of the movie about?? Hollywood continues flood out junk films."
1,"tepid - one tempo, a bunch of fx chases - boring","Lucky this is part of a trilogy - it sure couldn't stand on its own.One tempo for this movie - unless you count slowing down a slow movie even more as a tempo change. REALLY sad, as this was once a very cool franchise. Michael Keaton was the best Batman, giving a human edge to the character, with a little bit of craziness, to justify his becoming a crime hero. Now, it's SFX, one grainy voice void of emotion, and plot-less chases. Don't bother paying for this one - it'll play on network over and over, as all bad ""action movies"" eventually do."
3,Over hyped,"Worth watching, but not nearly as good as the first two. A couple of twists but both were broadcast far ahead. Wait for Netflix."
2,"Too long, boring at most times and awful scenes that make you say wtf","The movies in this series are alright. The first one was a good different style to see. The second one was over rated. And this one made me down right bored wanting to fast forward through parts. Some parts of the movie just lack common sense and are pointless. One point to my thought is Batmans ""spaceship""....yes he has one...anyways he gives a little grenade to blow a hole in a covered entrance to theunderground, it gets thrown and explodes...nothing happens...batman floats around the corner in his spaceship and shoots a rocket to blast it open...3 seconds later he is back on the ground talking....COME ON....this movie is a waste of time and money"
4,"very good, not great","Thoughtful and good conclusion to the trilogy. Not as engaging as the second. The Joker is a tough act to follow. But lots of talent. The best cat, most believable, ever. An ending worthy of the series. A must see, a little less than hoped."
1,Long and Boring,"Long, predictable, tedious .Did I say long and one big yawn.This movie could have wrapped in an hour and the story would still have been the same."
3,I expected more but it's okay.,There were some nice action scenes and all but this was not very memorable the last installment with Heath Ledger much better.
2,The Dark Knight Didn't Rise,"I found this third part in the modern ""Dark Knight"" movie series really disappointing and much too predictable. The portrayal of a bothered and beaten super-hero was carried out too long and depressing. The violence tried to make up for the slow-moving part in the first third or first half of the movie. I enjoyed the first two in the ""Dark Knight"" series far, far better in terms of their story lines and action than this third installment. Anne Hathaway is a wonderful ""eye candy"" but her role (not acting) is weak. Marion Cotillard's smoldering beauty is absolutely stunning."
4,Fine watch but it will be a long time before I watch it again,"I enjoyed this movie and watched it raptly, but I do not see myself watching it again for several years. There were certainly great parts but overall there were weak areas and cliches. And Bane? A strong character who just whimpered away. About time to hand over the baton."
3,"Awesome Effects, Decent Story","We had to watch this on a lower volume as the kids were upstairs sleeping. This impacted the viewing pleasure more than it should have. I got the sense that this movie was really great in theaters due to the special effects and awe inspiring sensory overload. However when you tone that down it reveals a story that seems a bit disjointed at times, sometimes explaining too much, sometimes too little. The emphasis was on a lead up to action or a supposedly emotion inducing scene; all these things seemed to jump around, like a graphic novel would, only we aren't encouraged to use our imaginations as much. I still enjoyed the movie, much of the acting was great (Bale was awesome), but overall it didn't have the same feel that Batman Begins or The Dark Knight did. Even Alfred seemed off his game..."
2,Good but...,"The movie itself is good, especially towards the end. Overall though it could have been shorter, or maybe we felt that way because the movie kept stopping midstream to buffer. It was very annoying to spend $5 for a movie that would freeze or fall out of sync every 15 minutes. I don't know if it was our internet or amazon's site. Either way I think we'll stick to the ""free"" movies offered through the prime membership."
4,Great movie,"I have found that most of the time when I purchase a Blu-ray/DVD without seeing the movie first I get disappointed a lot. Based on the two prior movies I took the plunge feeling as thought it was a safe bet. Despite the horrific tragedy which, I know most are aware of, I was able to get absorbed in the movie and not think about it. We loved this movie as we have the two others before."
2,Didn't care for it,"Admittedly hammered while I watched it, I felt like I wasn't having trouble following the plot but was just bored by it. When Catwoman jumped on the motorcycle and immediately knew how to operate it like a pro i LOL'd. Suspension of disbelief out the window! Did I miss the part where she trained on that thing? Anyway, the prison sequence was silly to me, no guards at the stop to kick prisoners back in when they escape?"
3,"ok movie, but not better than the earlier two","Maybe I just expect too much out of the entertainment industry. I guess I expect the film makers to out-do themselves every time. This was not as original or suspenseful as the first two movies. I understand trilogies sell - characters, boxed sets, all kinds of ways to make money, but each movie should improve upon the franchise. No need to have a film just for the sake of explaining the background or holes/ sub-plots of previous movies. Again, maybe I'm just asking too much."
5,This is a great movie and will forever sit in my heart,"we all know what happen in Aurora, its where I live I had to see it twice and let me tell you there is no force in this world that will ever stop me from watching it again.One of the best Batman movies to date it ends the trilogy quite nicely (and parents to children if you are not sure if you should let them watch it. It would be a disservice to all who was affected by the Aurora shooting If you chose not to let your children see it) This movie truly shows that good will always prevail and it compliments the spirit of Batman to the entirety."
4,Good movie,Me and my wife enjoyed this movie. Lots of action and special effects. Definitely a movie that you want to own in blu-ray not just DVD!Worth the upgrade price for sure!
3,"nice camera work, but drags and the editor didn't tie the storyline in a clear way",I felt tired after forcing myself to follow the hard to follow storyline. it is almost like the director and editors think that everyone is a Batman freak fan and memorized all the plots from the past. The introduction of new characters is not thorough and assumes that all the viewers did online research ahead of time.seems the story was patched together by an amateur.
5,Spectacular,Great end to a fantastic trilogy. The production is top notch and a fitting end to this great Nolan trilogy. I was hoping the movie would be in 3D but that has nothing to do with this Bluray release. Amazon had a great price to go along with the release.My one complaint was that this did not have many extra features but a minor gripe.
3,I expect... more.,Slow paced movie. A melodrama... with pics of action from time to time. Too quick and too easy fix to the happy ending.
4,Great Movie,"Solid end to a good series. If you liked the other two you'll probably like this one. It is fairly long, but worth it."
2,"Holy long and convoluted, Batman!","To be succinct, let me just say I didn't expect this movie to be as long as it was. And to have more Batman.At about halfway through the movie, I paused it to go to the bathroom, already a little bored but thinking he were just about to get to the final big showdown. No sir! We still had about 15 plot twists to go, and more than an hour and a half. Things went downhill from there, too, with a lot of the plot making little sense. Only in the last ten minutes or so did I feel the movie take off, but the build up to that small payoff just wasn't worth it."
2,Batman.... Summon stupid deep voice,Bane is not the best bad guy in the series and the douche bag that plays batman is just a douche bag.
2,Greatly Overrated!!!!,The film is long on action but short on plot.....Anne Hathaway is one of the finest female actors of our time but her character drove me batty.... Two stars for this overly long and sometimes unwatchable film....
2,Not what I expected,It was not what I had hoped for or expected it to be.it was a let down from hollywood.
2,So boring...Couldn't even watch it all the way through!,"I was seriously disappointed - The Dark Knight was SUCH a fantastic movie, but this was just a big letdown. Gloomy, depressing and overall extremely boring. The movie is way too long to keep my interest going, and since the plot was just a big pile of blah I couldn't make it all the way through. I watched about an hour and then called it quits and watched something else."
3,It was Okay.,"I heard all the hype about this movie when it came out. And then the awful tragedy in the theater. I expected it to be more than it was. It was unrealistic at times, and it was too BIG at times. A lot continuity questions for me also (how did a broke Bruce Wayne get back to Gotham so quickly?). It had the potential to be a good story at the start, but later on the film, it just got unrealistic."
2,Should have left well enough alone,"I had high hopes for this film, perhaps too high. My first issue was the story. Alfred made Bruce Wayne into batman. Then he decides to bounce? The first half hour of the film could honestly be chopped off. Next we have the unacceptable altering of characters. Selina Kyle was not just some jewel thief. She was a victim of attempted murder. Oh and Robin was a circus performer, not a Gotham city cop. I could say more and more bad things about this, but frankly I have things to do. One thing I did like was the villain. Baine was funny. Especially his voice. But you never see what's under his mask. One more thing. Spoiler alert. He's not the villain... Zing!"
3,Received on time and in good condition.,"Received DVD before X'mas... Plays well, good pictures. Will be uploading to cloud for easier access. Storyline is as we know it, Fantactic."
5,The best Batman movie,I think this is the best Batman movie - loved the story- very well written and the actors did a great job. It was a great ending to the trilogy.
3,Pretentious,"I don't understand why this series is so popular. The story plods, Bale's portrayal of Batman is really sub-par, and, for such a cheesefest, this movie really acts much more important that it really is. I'd like to say save your money for a better movie but this is pretty standard fare now. Had the studio decided to leave Batman out of this movie and focus on the Robin and Catwoman characters, both of which are woefully neglected in this movie, this probably could have been an interesting movie."
3,Not as good as the last,"I liked how Batman Begins had a slight sense of realism to it. This one went over the top in the ""oh come on"" factor."
3,Just okay,We were expecting something along the lines of the last installment of The Dark Knight. We were pretty disappointed. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. It was just okay.
5,Dark Knight,"Best one yet, although the final one, hope that someone picks up the series and keeps it going for a long time!"
4,Great but just a tad formulaic,"I don't consider myself a huge fan of the Batman flicks, but I know what I like, and I loved TDK. What I loved most about it was that the threat posed by Joker wasn't that of your standard movie bad guy. His actions were more cerebral; less about the physical carnage he could inflict and more about the psychological impact that resulted. It came down to high concepts and those characters who embodied them. I expected something as grand as that in TDKR but it didn't quite get there for me. Things like the stereotypical (and under-developed) police chief gunning for the glory of taking down Batman, a clean energy technology being turned into a bomb, and then stopping that bomb from blowing just felt formulaic. Not that it wasn't executed well, or that watching Batman and Bane duke it out was lame (it was great), it just felt a bit less inspired that I had hoped."
1,Same as all the others,"I was hoping (as happened with Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol) that I might actually find something to like in this particular Batman movie. But alas, it was the same dark, foreboding, confused, nonsensical mess the others were. I don't fault others for liking these movies, to each their own, but if you're hoping for something more - forget it."
3,Dark Knight,Great storyline... great beginning... ending got kind of uninteresting and predictable and really the dialgue lost out too. Fizzled! Sorry!
4,Very interesting movie,"While it was very long, almost 3 hours, I enjoyed it. Themes of class struggle, terrorism, and personal responsibility are all part of this action packed movie. A few of the fight scenes could have been shortened, I thought, but ultimately, it was a very interesting movie that kept my attention. I would watch this one again."
4,End of an era,I absolutely loved The Dark Knight!!!!!!!!!!!! This was a good effort to close the series. Not as good as its predecessor though.
5,I love Batman,"Batman is pretty awesome & I'm glad they finally included Bane in a movie. Not the biggest fan of Anne Hathaway as Selina, but whatever...Tom Hardy as Bane made up for it. I would recommend this movie to others."
4,My only wish,"I liked this movie, not as good as the 2nd but still a great film. My only wish is that Blu-rays like this would offer the itunes copy too. not just ultraviolent."
3,Suspend Disbelief,"Ok, first of all, the premise is absurd to begin with - billionaire orphan becomes masked crimefighter with near superhuman abilities. But you go in knowing that, so you give it a pass. What I find hard to give a pass to are all the inconsistencies and leaps of logic and/or faith you are asked to accept or ignore. These are detailed in many other places and some are spoilers so I won't go into them. But, if you suspend disbelief and just watch it for what it is - a comic book story with pretensions - you'll enjoy it. I did. But that doesn't mean it's worth more than three stars.Plus, be advised - you need the flixster app to watch the ultraviolet copy. It won't download to iTunes."
4,Awesome!,"Great movie, wonderfully done, and an excellent ending to the trilogy. I definitely am going to buy this now that I have seen it."
3,average,"I preordered this blu-ray because I own the first two. The Dark Knight was a great movie, but this one failed to capture the excitement of the first one. It felt as though too much story was being forced into it, but none of them were explored enough to make it whole. I mean, Comm Gordon had a bit part basically even though he was s o integral to the first two. Bane was a mess. And there were better villians that could have been utilized. And when he took Gotham hostage, that was so totally unbelievable that it almost made me walk out. I mean, the US let that happen! Months passed! Totally ludicrous."
3,Too much hype,I think the mass shooting gave this movie too much hype. It was just fairly written and good cinema effects.
2,Why so long?,"Just not very good, couldn't understand the bad guy 1/2 the time, the story dragged, wanted more action... No reason this needed to be almost 3 hours!"
1,The dark knight rises...not really,"First Off I want to say I'm a Big Batman Fan and as a Batman Fan I've come to expect a lot from the character.The Batman in this film is NOT batman! He's a Lazy bum that gets his Bat butt handed to him the whole movie and then cat woman saves the day....Worst batman Movie ever made hands down. Don't even get me started on the plot holes. Fox says to Wayne that you can easily flood the room holding the nuke in one scene,but then in another scene where Fox was at the controls to the Nuke he handed the nuke over to the bad guys instead of flooding the place...really?It was just a really bad Movie with zero redeeming qualities."
1,Amazon will not let you stream HD to your PC,"My review is regarding delivery, not the movie itself. Beware that you cannot stream any HD movies to your PC, you need to have one of the devices they list to stream HD.At the top of the listing in the blue bar they say ""Available in HD for playback on Kindle Fire HD, Xbox 360, PS3, Roku, TiVO or other HD compatible devices."" Well, my pc is an HD compatible device, but I cannot watch the movie in HD.I stream HD content from Netflix and Hulu daily. So needless to say I am a little irritated."
4,"A fitting conclusion to the trilogy, but I don't like endings","I did enjoy this movie, but it was my least favorite of the C. Nolan trilogy. Perhaps if I'd read the comic books I'd have a better appreciation of the grimness."
3,Too Long,This movie was too long and presented a portrait of Batman that showed him as physically weak. I didn't care for that.Tom McRae
3,Everyone very satisfied,"All of the above items were Christmas gifts and were well recieved, the MM book and the Legos Flying Mummy Attack especially."
3,Movie okay. Flixster poor,Didn't like the movie nearly as much as the last one. I guess the performance by Heath Ledger spoiled this one. Worse was the Flixster ultraviolet offer. Using the web site was painful. Took forever to load the home page and had to keep clicking on the continue button after entering the code for the movie. Then when signing up for an account it just hung until finally getting a server error message. Not very professional.
2,Miserable,Plotless and nonsensical story with mediocre acting and inferior filming stye produces and event that is nearly a complete bore
5,Amazing,"Loved everything about the movie. It's quite a long movie, but time flew by and I enjoyed every minute.Christopher Nolan had another huge success making Bane such a brilliant villain. Tom Hardy showed once again he's a real badass. I wish some things have been slightly different (e.g. Bane is too human to my taste, he should've been more monstrous), but I couldn't expect a more enjoying Batman movie than that."
5,Great,"Great movie, one of my favorite Batman movies, other than the very first one. I rank this one a tie as the best."
3,Dark Knight Dark!,"This is by far the darkest Batman. Loked it, didn't love it. Acting, very good...special affects OK. Loved Ann as Catwoman!"
4,Dark Knight Rises,Not what I expected. Good entertainment but the storyline and characters are a bit like Swiss cheese... Full of holes. Worth the $3.99 rental price but I wouldn't buy it.
4,"Good movie, great streaming","First off, the streaming experience in HD was flawless over our Roku box with high speed cable internet. We have Prime and that has had a few bumps in the past, but recently has improved and this rented movie experience was great.The movie itself was very good. It had the action you would expect, but also had alot of story to go along with it. I won't put any spoilers in my review. My 14 year old and I both agreed that we are anxiously awaiting the next installment of this series of movies."
2,poor poor batman,The dark knight was a definitive film. This follow up was terrible. It dragged. Lacked excitement...luster....glitz like the others. In fact I would say this was less entertaining than the original tv series! And that's bad.
4,The Dark Knight Rises,The poduct was great and well put together! Pre-ordered the DVD a couple months prior and received it about two weeks after the release date.
3,You can like it- and not like it,"Like: Bane was a brut.Not Like: He beat up Batman.Like: Cat woman.Not like: Limited role. No finese.Like: Commisioner is backNot like: thought he got popped in 2.Like: lots of action.Not Like: too much shooting.This is a like-don't like Batman sequel.I'm guessing this is it for Christian Bale.Heck, I thought Clooney was a great Batman.... I miss the jokes. We need a Batman who can make me laugh."
3,The Dark Knight Rises Review,"The movie was pretty good, overall, but the story line was a little underdeveloped. The detective character needed more work as well. Bane was a really good bad guy."
5,great movie,A very good action movie with a great storyline. Loved the ending and hope for some more batman movies very soon!
1,Ultraviolet? No thanks.,"Please give us real digital download options... google play or itunes would be nice. Ultraviolet is a joke, hopefully it dies off soon!Real options = more stars."
1,Won't Buy,"Only UV digital copy? No thanks. I won't be buying this. While I'm sure the movie looks great, I don't buy Blu-ray/DVD's that don't come with digital copies other than UV. UltraViolet is DRM Hell and useless."
1,batman is a bumbling retard always getting beatup,"strangest batman movie i ever watrched,i never even made it through the entire film,batman is rarely seen,and when he is he is a bumbling retard always in pain and getting beat up..isnt batman supposed to be doing the beating up?this movie is deranged,and kinda sick..it made me sick watching it..all i can think about is the $4 i wasted"
2,No heart,Too long and meandering. Lots of noise and action and yet somehow still lifeless in a lot of spots. Mayhem by the numbers.
3,Worth watching in order to complete the trilogy,"I was excited to watch this given how amazing the last one was. Also, I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy so I was excited that he portrayed the villain (to say nothing of Gray Oldman's prowess). Unfortunately, it fell flat. Too much was included and as a result the movie moved much too quickly from scene to scene. Overall, a disappointment."
3,Too much dialogue,"The movie crashed three times so this review is biased because I was already aggravated.I thought the movie had too many philosophic discourses that slowed down the action.And Bale seemed outmatched as never before.I'll give it another chance, but right now I feel the Dark Night should have stayed down."
4,The Dark Knight Rises: Limited Edition,"I liked the editing, however there are some defects, such as the box of discs, is very weak and gave me the impression that it is a bad product, wish it was like the Brazilian edition, which besides this box, comes the traditional case for the person choose where to place the disc!"
3,Good but too Long,"This was a really good story. The action is superb. The acting was really good. A couple of things I don't like is 1) this movie breaks the #1 rule about Batman in that almost no one knows who he is, but in this movie, by the end you wonder if there is anyone who doesn't know Batman's secret identity. 2) this movie ran too long. Therefore this is not a movie I can watch many times because it is way too long. Otherwise I would recommend to this to others as really good."
3,Meh. and a little frustrating,I get picky about holes in plotlines and this movie had some glaring ones. Read the myriad of 3 star reviews and they pretty much cover my feelings on this installment of the franchise.
5,Hate that this is the end of Nolan's Batman movies!,"Epic conclusion to the most recent Batman Saga. Features a lot of familiar faces (Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman) and brings some new commonly featured Batman characters (Catwoman, Bane, and a hint toward another). Although it is a lengthy movie, it demands your attention the whole way through, you won't want to take breaks. lots of clues given to the die hard Batman fans, like myself (hopefully it doesn't make this review too biased lol). Like I said in the title, hate that this is the end of Nolan's Batman movies, but man what an epic ending! Any Batman fan should have already seen this movie in theaters, and to all those not into Batman, you're missing out on an saga, you should definitely check them out!!!"
1,worst movie i've seen in YEARS!,"awful, full of plot holes and forced-dialogue to explain things so you dont feel completely lost. AWFUL movie and i absolutely LOVED the previous Batmans"
1,Wtf?,"This movie is absolutely horrible! Being a fan since Adam West and Burt Ward I have seen various re-telling of the epic Batman story, thinking that none could get worse than Batman Forever. Man was I ever wrong. This story makes no sense in the scheme of Batman, it flips all over the place trying to appeal to, honestly I don't know what kind of audience this new series of Batman is trying to appeal to. The characters are completely off of who they are supposed be, the story line is desperate, the attempt at a shock factor is pathetic, and half the time I couldn't understand the words Bane spoke. I'm sure one day I will be saying the same thing again with this movie ""just when I thought Batman couldn't get worse..."""
3,"Great Film, but Warner Brothers Has Dropped iTunes Digital Copies","I won't be providing another long-winded review of a great ending to a great trilogy. I thought it important though to let everyone know that the Digital Copy for this film does NOT include iTunes - it is strictly Ultraviolet, which is a code word for we'll let you watch the film digitally... as long as we control the how you do part. That is enough for me to pass on this version and spend the same money on the boxed trilogy (and sell my individual copies of the first two films)."
1,Not as ex[ected.,I am a huge fan of Batman and own all the movies. I waited until this one came out on DVD to watch it home on my huge TV but it was terrible. I honestly wanted to turn it off 1 hour into the movie but kept thinking that the good part was just around the corner.......it wasn't. This is one of the worst movies I've had the displeasure of watching this year and I watch A LOT of movies. The only good thing about it was the graphics. The story itself was too long and drawn out to hold your attention. If you're thinking about buying it and haven't seen it yet......don't bother. There's better things to waste your money on.
1,One star Review,"Review:Waste of money! Bad acting.Very unbelievable fight scenes. You can actually see the extras/stuntfighters pausing so that Batman/Batgirl can do their thing. If this goes on sales for 99 cents, you'd still pay to much."
2,Where's Batman?,"2 Hours and 45 minutes and it could be argued that Batman only shows up in the last few minutes. The rest of this snorefest is occupied by Bruce Wayne, who apparently is a cripple. Having spent the last EIGHT YEARS moping and feeling sorry for himself suddenly decides that being a cripple will not stop him from stopping Bane. Bane stomps him into the dirt and throws him in a ""Hole"" which a lot of other people are consigned to as a prison. Bane spends the next three month destroying Gotham and Murdering anyone he pleases.Somehow in this cesspool Bruce Wayne does a few pushups and gets his health back...escapes and then the fight begins in the last part of this movie.Give me a freakin' break."
5,The Bluray Rises,Waiting for Bluray...Great way to end the story. Nolan at his best. Hans Zimmer has done incredible Job.Cat Women Charter Impressive. Congrats to the whole Team.
1,Forget this one,Watch the first two and forget this on was made. I don't care how much money this movie made it is just a very bad movie when compared with the others. Maybe they didn't think they had to try.
1,Easily the worst of the three films.,"Having loved the first two I was fully expecting the same from this third installment. But, unfortunately this is one of those films where they are really attempting to outdo the others and make it spectacular. They proceeded to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, but then what the hell they threw that in too. Poor plot, poor story telling; very disappointing. Then to end with Disney's: ""And they lived happily ever after,"" was just too much. I wish they had never made this one. It left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Nothing to do with Batman?,Batman was hardly in this movie. It was confusing and ridiculous. I thoroughly enjoyed all the other Batman movies - NOT this one!
2,Not like comic violence,"The special effects of the movie were fine, but I'm afraid that I've become weary of the constant violence. It was one thing when it was in the comic books, but IMHO, the realism portrayed in movies is not good: to wit, the murders at its opening in Colorado."
3,I'll never get that 2 and half hours back.,This was like an old 80's flick where the hero needs too much motivation and extra training to do his duty.
3,Ultraviolet digital copy,"The movie is amazing. Love the DVD and bluray. I usually buy digital copies so I can watch movies on my iPhone but the ultraviolet copy is streamed from online from a third party company, meaning you don't really own it or have it. You don't get a ""copy"" but rights to an online streaming service for this one film. Feel a bit ripped off on that point. If I want an actual digital copy ill have to buy it separately. Plus I have to pay Verizon for streaming the movie to my phone if I take the ultraviolet route."
3,Batman is back but not the same.,There are all kinds of FX effects but the story is weak. Batman seems a little over the hill in this one. Not my first choice but not the worst either.
2,Waaay too long.,The movie is over long. The dialog is mostly unintelligible.Fisticuffs make no sense when the plotline involves a WMD.
2,Over hyped!!!!,"Based on the review of others, I was expecting a great show. This was extremely long and dragged out and just had no real point to it. Great disappointment. The Batman Begins of the trilogy with Christian Bale was the best of the three. So disappointed. Glad I didn't waste my money and get the trilogy Blu ray combo pack."
3,Disapointed,I was very disapointed with this movie. I was expecting much better. This is one I would wait for it to come out on a premimum channel. Wasn't worth the rental and ceryainly wouldn't buy!
2,Didn't like the streaming,Way too many pauses in the buffering of the down loading. Red box would be cheaper and more more enjoyable.
4,Not bad but not as good as it could have been,"The film is definitely worth watching, however, if you expect to see a lot of Batman action then you will be disappointed as the majority of the film has Bruce Wayne on screen instead. The sections when he is as Batman are great, the fight sequences are good with the only real let down being the ""healing process"" which I'm sure not one doctor in the world would approve of (except maybe Dr Nick from Simpsons).Bane was a great opposition for Batman and the story twist is partially unexpected and keeps the film going well.The ending of this film does set up the next film quite well which I have to say I am already looking forward to."
2,Great Movie...this copy has the worst format of digital copy,"The actual content of the movie is awesome as expected. The Blu-ray/DVD Como+UltraViolet Digital Copy, specifically the digital copy, is not compatible with iTunes as most of the movies that I have purchased in this type of bundle are. Lesson learned do your research before buying digital copy combo deals"
4,Profoundly Epic Sensationally Spectacular!!! A MUST BUY,"This Movie is awesome!!!!!!!! Batman is my favorite superhero and when you put a great superhero+ Christopher Nolan that ultimately= The Greatest trilogy ever!!! So much can be said about this film. The acting is nothing short of great; Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane. The plot does has some unexpected twists that will surprise you. Christian Bale again delivers with his performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman. This truly is the greatest ending to the best superhero trilogy ever! And finally Batman was needed and not just deserved in this film. Thank You Christopher Nolan what you have done is made Batman the best superhero ever!! Cannot wait for this dvdRIP to the Aurora,Colarado victims."
4,Great Movie,This movie was fun for me to watch. Especially back in the day if you were a comic book fan. I would recommend this movie to those who are Comic Book buffs or just plain want to be well entertained. Liked it.
2,lame,"The story was weak, but if you are a ten year old maybe it is a great movie. Not worth the money, just rehashed garbage."
4,Very entertaining film.,"This film is very well made, well paced, just very well thought out, and very well crafted toward what it wants to be.It reminds me a lot of those big tentpole movies of the thirties and fourties. Hundreds of Extras, big overarching storyline, hero on a journey for self-redemption, it's just very classic in that regard.I would definitely recommend giving this one a rental, you will not be disappointed in my opinion."
4,Great ending to a great series,Was defiantly not disappointed in this move. It's almost 3 hours long and the time flew by watching it. Great movie!!
1,Waste of resources,"I paid $3.99 to see The Dark Knight Rises--If I had it to do over, I would not pay 39 cents. This flick is two hrs. 44 min long and if you ask me it is two hrs. 44 min TOO long. I had to stop it 1/2 way through because I could not find a sharp pencil with which to stab myself in the eyeballs to relieve the tedium. If you have not seen this waste of time count your blessings. If you have and paid $8 at the theater, I think there is a government program that might get your bucks back. However, I eventually did find a knitting needle with which to inflict damage to my brown orbs and did indeed finish watching The Dark Knight through a bloody veil. If forced between watching this movie a second time or death on the rack, I would cheerfully choose the latter."
5,"Enough with the ""UV"" rant already! The movie's excellent, why make useless criticisms?","Seriously, these ""UV"" rants are now getting old. We get it: UV sucks. Always is and always shall be. But please, folks, discuss this in forums, not in a review form. Does not help the film at all. You're making the overall ratings unnecessarily worse.As for the film (something that everyone should be discussing!), it may not be as good or better than The Dark Knight, but it's definitely one of those sequels that everyone should take a look. Action scenes are done well, Bane is surprising being taken in a serious role, and the story is great, yet a bit flawed (though, not in a grand scale). Whether or not it has a forced UV copy, it's a must-buy release. 8/10"
2,Very long and long winded..,"I think they could have easily cut this movie by about 1/2 hour and made some drastic changes to the story line. I mean, come on, the bad guy is going to exact his revenge on Batman by making Gotham suffer for months and then right when he is going to destroy Gotham is thwarted by some last minute BS.I understand that this is sort of the story of Batman, long drawn out plots, but this takes the cake.I enjoyed the 2nd movie the best, the first one was pretty good, but this one sucked and sucked and sucked and then sucked some more (I needed four 'sucks' to emphasize the fact that this movie seemingly never ends)."
5,Great Movie,Came in good shape and is a wonderful movie. I highly recommend this buy. Great price as well. Beats the franchises.
2,Slow moving,"A lot of people liked the movie, so my opinions are only that...opinions.I am over 50, and I grew up with the old school superheros, so the whole ""dark"" thing is a little different than what I'm used to.The first installments of the Dark Knight were pretty good. This movie however, was way too slow for me. Too much back-story and not enough action.And with all the back-story, there were still some elements that weren't explained at all.Over all, not a movie I would want to see again."
2,BOR-ING,I've been a huge Batman fan for years and was really looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately this was the most boring film I have seen in a while. The scenes are really drawn out and I feel like the script could have been written a lot better. Wasn't really feeling Anne Hathaway as Cat woman at all either. She has about as much acting skills as that girl who does the T-mobile commercials and I felt she brought the movie down tremendously. Saddened to say that this film did not meet my expectations... at all. Disappointed.
4,My least favorite of the series....but still good,"When it comes to action scenes, cinematography, sound, music, special effects, choreography, this movie is top of the heap. I would characterize the action sequences as nothing short of amazing. However, the story fell a little flat, despite having some seriously good performances by some great actors. There are just a little too many plot holes and nonsensical things in the story that prevent me from giving it higher marks. For instance, the entire Stock Market scene was just ridiculous. (I'll leave spoilers out though.)As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, it's well worth the money. Fantastic picture."
4,"Ignoring the UltraVoilet issue, this is a good, not great, finish to the trilogy","Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are both better than The Dark Knight Rises, but few movie series hold this level of quality all the way through. Look how strong the Matrix started and then fell way off. Star Wars, Star Trek, and so many others did not deliver great movies all through their series. Lord Of The Rings is as close as it gets for a great trio, but even it is flawed. I feel like some are putting the bar extra high after how impressive The Dark Knight did. The Dark Knight Rises is a good film. The biggest disappointment is how predictable the finish was, which is not very Nolan like. For such a Maverick film maker, this final installment just did not have that original spin Nolan films often have.Bottom line, if you love the first two, this is worth getting. If you thought the first two were okay, then this is a rental at best."
5,gift,"this was also a gift so i am not sure what to say here. Except, that my granddaughter loved it!"
5,love!,must watch! must own!I bought this as a gift for my gf. it's under the tree rigt now couldn't wait for Christmas to watch it :) so I used amazon off my ps3 quality was perfect stream was perfect!! price was a little eh for a HD but still...it's batman!!
3,"Some surprises, story is a little weak.","Batman has always been an obsession, so I am predisposed to like any Batman product or anything with an appearance by Adam West. This movie was fun, a little like Mad Max, but I was expecting a bit more. There were some good surprises, so that was the redeeming feature, but some things were bothersome. For example, Bain's mask served no apparent purpose. If it was giving him oxygen, there certainly wasn't enough to last long. Knock a couple pieces loose and he was weak. What was the story with all the fluorescent lights in the prison? It made it seem rather modern rather than some ancient facility. Why climb the rocks if you can get pulled up with the rope or tie a homemade grappling hook to it? For me, the story was a real let down from the philosophical musings of the Joker."
2,"Good action, wimpy batman","There is some cool action in the video, but basically its a wimpy batman, and the plot did not keep me interested."
3,Fizzled finale,"I had high expectations for the conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy of Batman stories. Unfortunately, he fell flat. I have no issue with writers and directors taking liberties with characters, but if the only similarity you are going to keep is the name, why bother? It is like he forgot what his formula was. I was very disappointed."
3,Nowhere near as good as The Dark Knight,"It's a pity. This story has some depth and the effects are original, but compared to the power of The Dark Knight's script and the character portrayals in both Batman Begin and The Dark Knight Rises, this is a weak effort. I will say this, however: Tom Hardy threw everything he had into Bane, and became the best thing in this film."
3,expected more,very slow start got better in the end. not a movie i need to see more than once. wish i did not buy
3,Dark Knight should stay fallen,"No one likes a weak hero, but that's exactly what Chrisian Bale pulled off. The script was weak and even the beautiful addition of Cat Woman [ Anne Hathaway ] could not save this weak film. We have grown to expect much from the Dark Knight and I am sad to say that watching one more of this caliber could ruin the legend."
3,Not the best Batman,The show was good but it felt more pieced together and not fully thought out. Most of the show just felt like the editor went nuts pasting together scenes hoping to fit them together cutting out a lot of more informative pieces. The first two Batman shows seemed like it could have been more real than the others that followed a more comic book routine. Not saying the movie was not worth a watch but more informative scenes bringing about the logic of the events would have made it a lot better than just the action sequences. I would say watch it but don't expect it to be the best.
5,Gift for Grandchildren,The grandkids love the movie as do we. Can watch it over and over again. Good addition to our collection.
4,"Good film, which is ruined by an over bassy and loud distorted soundtrack","I brought my copy from Asda in the UK and it seems that are region B version has a ridiculous DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack. The bass is way to high and the volume is to loud to a point where it distorts no matter how much you turn it down, I had to turn my subwoofer down by a massive 6 dB and the same with the EQ for all the surround and front speakers. I really like this film but refuse to watch it more than once as the soundtrack is just to annoying. Does the region A version sound the same or has it been mastered properly? I do have a multi-zone bluray player and would love to watch this film with the DTS audio sounding correct can some one let me know if the U.S version has a correct DTS 5.1 soundtrack as our region b version is pants!!!!"
4,Dark Knight Rises,Definitely a great addition to the collection. Amazing quality on the kindle also. Worth renting on instant video for movie night.
3,Sound and Graphics were great!,"Story line was a bit to dark, for my taste. Check it out, you will like it.Great for demonstrating the sound system..."
2,Different on PC than PS3 in Unbox,"I started watching this movie on a flight on unbox on my PC. Great movie, completely engrossing. The next day I watched the decided to watch the movie on our TV at home on PS3 and the version was horribly cut. Terrible editing that lead to plot confusion and a far inferior film.I am tempted to buy the DVD but am now very concerned about Unbox movies and their editing"
4,Great movie,"A little long, but definitely interesting and action packed. Unexpected twists and turns at the end make for a strong finish... solid ending. Acting is very good and the special effects are through the roof."
3,It's OK,I love Batman movies this one however was missing something I don't know what it was. It get's old the same story.
2,SO SO DISAPPOINTED,"I hardly ever give a bad rating, but I just thought they could have did alot better job on making this movie. There was too much Bane and too little Batman."
2,Package.,"The dvds don't want to snap back in to the box. I let someone use it and when I looked down later on that night, the Blu Ray disk was under tree. Seems like they are trying to go to far in all the dvds,"
5,The Dark Knight Rises,"Batman will always come back as the good guy. The message here for everyone, especially the youth, is that good will always prevail and we must continue to fight against evil."
3,Good movies,"Of course, I got the movies because it was the finale in the series. But, for some reason, I am not as high and mighty about it as the rest of the world. I prefer the first two, but I do love the ending scene and how the story got there."
3,He should have stayed where he was,"This was just plain pathetic. First of all, why does Christian Bales' voice change from being understandable as Bruce Wayne to a gravely growl as Batman. I could barely understand him. His sudden reappearance after being ""beat down"" is predictable but frankly this whole movie was unnecessary. I personally liked the first, as even the Joker (Heath Ledger) was likable if not just plain evil."
3,Great movie but I hate ultraviolet only digital option,I thought this was going to have an iTunes copy when I preordered it but I was mistaken. I have tried using ultraviolet but the website is terrible and you cannot redeem codes via mobile devices. I loved the movie despite what some people point out as plot holes. I recommend this for the bluray but I almost wish I just would have bought it on iTunes.
3,Ok,"The movie was OK, but there could have been alot more action or exitment. after all, it is a batman movie"
5,Awesome movie!,I love this movie! This director definitely doesn't disappoint! Batman begins and The dark knight (the first two movies in this serires) are really great movies and im glad this one lived up to my expectations. I know many movies that get worse as squeals come out but this is definitely not one of them!
5,Best Batman Movie Yet!,"I saw this movie twice in the theaters, once regular and once in IMAX. Both times were awesome but IMAX was better of course. This movie by far the best batman yet. Bane was an amazing Villain and I dont see how this can be out done. But I said that after The Dark Knight as well. All in all, an amazing movie. Definitely one I am going to be purchasing.BUY IT!!"
3,Hard to hear,Movie was okay. But hard to follow plot as the sound jumped up and down. Could not always make out what the characters said.
2,Cowl was smaller than I expected,"I was surprised by how small the cowl was, but other than that the item is very nice. There is no case for the discs as they fit in a compartment on the back of the base for the cowl."
2,"Weak - shoot, kill, shoot, kill... repeat",This is the worse Batman ever.It is meant as a bridge to hand the acting roll to another actor - really! dont make a movie out of a business decision.Bond movies dont put us thru the agony of handing roles between actors.Total waste of time.
5,Rising,"Though this film is MUCH darker than the first two, it is such a gripping and intense story, that I didn't want to get up to miss any of it. Definitely waiting for the next attempt on this Franchise. My First Favorite Cartoon Crimefighter is still alive!"
2,Dark and Slow,"I am a huge Sci Fi and comic fan (which- for a woman- means I expect a certain level of entertainment in my movies)but The Dark Knight just didn't do it for me. The lighting in the movie was so dark I often had trouble seeing what was going on, which pretty much defeats the purpose. Also, Tom Hardy's Bane needed subtitles much of the movie, which made watching a chore instead of entertaining. The only reason I have it two stars instead of one was for the redeeming ending, which was a welcome twist."
3,Do not recommend on Amazon Instant Video.,"I would rate this movie a 4.5 stars, but since I rented it via Amazon Instant Video on my PS3, I have to downgrade it to 3 stars. The sound quality was horrible. I had my TV's volume on full blast and could not hear a thing.In the end I had to stop the movie and hook up my PC via HDMI in order to hear the movie; only to find out that Amazon doesn't support HD on PCs. What a bummer. :/"
2,If you saw The Dark Knight you've already seen this one,"If you loved The Dark Knight you'll probably love this one. If you had any qualms with the previous entry, then avoid it."
4,too long,"It was good, but way too long. The movie could have been wrapped up in two hours and it did not get interesting until the final hour"
2,lost concept,"i have always been a batman fan. even the first 2 in this series i liked. but this last installment i am glad to say was a fitting end. this movie to me sucked. from start to finish. the only thing i liked was the action sequences. the rest of it was so far displaced from any kind of originality of batman was insulting. i bought the blue-ray, and am very sorry i did."
2,Old Man Batman,"Couple of good action scenes, but other than that I was wondering why am I watching an old broken down Batman..."
2,Plot? Character development?,"The plot was thin, choppy and poorly constructed. The storyline broke off into tangents and was hard to follow. Little to no character development (save Joe Levitt ""Robin"" who was BY FAR the most interesting character). Anne Hathaway was a passive little princess of a Catwoman and left me missing Michelle Pfeiffer who even in her 50's would have played a still better seductress! What's Bane's story? Surely deeper than the puddle of a storyline they presented for him which ended up being the films most interesting twist thus only raising more questions to his character in general. Lastly, the fight choreography was weak. For the trilogy having started on a solid formal combat training basis I found the hand to hand fighting scenes lacking, staged and as cheesey as 1960's Batman minus Adam West and onomatopoeia graphics. 2 hrs and 45 mins for what?"
4,Batman!,"I saw it three times at the movie theater, and you mus suppose I'll see it many more times at home. Just missed some extras, but... Batman!"
3,reason it was ok,The ending was bad I did not like it. I wonder if there will be any more batman movies after this one?
5,Surprised at how much I liked this movie!,My favorite of all the Batman movies. Couldn't leave my seat. Not nearly as dark as previous ones. Great movie!
4,"Good, not great.","I enjoyed the last installment of the Dark Knight series; but honestly, it wasn't as good as the second movie. I found Bane to be silly instead of scary. Enjoyed the caustic Catwomen."
1,Overrated,"I honestly don't know why this movie is so popular. The story was weak (lets stick batman in jail so he can break out in a spectacular way?) and the villain was ho-hum (we didn't get to destroy gotham in the first movie, so lets try again- but harder this time.) Where did Bane even come from anyway? Why does he have it in for batman? Nothing was explained.This movie had nothing of the intrigue and plot twists of Dark Knight which made that movie so amazing. Obviously it's hard to follow Heath, but they should have spent more time dealing with batman's struggle and physiological growth. Or at least some depth, rather then large scenes of football stadiums blowing up.I'm sorry, but the first two movies blow this one away. Pass."
1,Ultraviolet Sucks,"This review is not on the movie (I haven't watched it yet), but on Ultraviolet and Flixster. I purchased the movie with Ultraviolet planning on downloading and watching it on an iPad during a plane ride tomorrow. On the very first login to download the movie I got the message ""Max authorization code use exceeded"". I had to email Ultraviolet/Flixster and fill out a form. Now I am waiting to hear from Ultraviolet, but so far nothing.This will be the last time I order a movie with Ultraviolet. When I get back, I will watch the movie on BluRay and submit a review for the movie."
1,"Very disappointed, no itunes digital download","As the title states, it is an ultravillet digital download, not an itunes digital download as it has been with prior purchase. Very disappointed, considering returning the purchase. Even more disappointing is the fact that it doesnt show up in my Amazon Prime Video Library... WTF!"
4,Good movie but .....,The movie with the joker ruled this series with an iron fist. It started out really slow too. Fun to watch.
5,Excellent movie,Even though it is a classic movie I really enjoy see in it over and over again. I really got it for a good price. Now I have the 3 movies so my saga it is complete
1,WORSE BATMAN EVER,COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD. WHEN ANNE HATHAWAY STEALS A BATMAN MOVIE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. JUST AWFUL AND FELL ASLEEP
2,you can fight better with a broken back??,"this was not a good movie. bad catwomen along with a bad story line. really the police are living under ground? they put cat women in a mans prison? you dont think all the excons where rapeing and killing all the civlins?? they would have been no city for him to come back to! and how in the hell did he make it back to the city so fast? he had a broken back with the bone out! they punched it back in, he could not beat bane when he was better but then got a broken back and could not lose. baddddddddddddddd movie! and that was just a few problems with it"
1,Good Luck with the UV digital copy,"Getting the UV copy for Dark Knight Rises in my collection was impossible. I went to Flixster to redeem Batman Dark Knight Rises, tried to connect the accounts finally got it done and it wants me to pay for the movie & the redeem code expires on Dec 4th the day of the release...will probably return the movie and just get it on itunes so i can have it on my ipad, etc."
1,Ironic that these comic book kid's content,"is so violent and illogical that it is not for kids.So who is it for, and who can get anything positive out of this stuff?I really thought this was nonsense, and that Batman voice was terrible.The idea that a fusion reactor is so small and portable and can be tossed around like a basketball is curious.A terrible movie."
5,WoW!,"I was crazy to not see this in the Movie house..Fantastic Film,wanted to jump into the scream and help the team out."
3,Not a great third movie,"I feel there was way too much conversation that went no where. Bain was a cool character and played well, however, the story took way too long to really kind of go no where. I don't know, I watched it, it was alright, don't feel the need to sit through 2 hours and 45 minutes again. If you haven't seen it, it is worth it just for the sake of completing the Trilogy."
3,The Sun Has set on this Dark Knight.,I found the movie dull and Laborious. There was a lot of potential in this storyline but the movie didn't utilize what could have been at least a good action flick
3,ok,I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I actually shouldn't be reviewing it yet because the two times that I tried watching it I fell asleep before it ended. It may have gotten better. I will try again to watch it at some point and edit this if I change my mind
5,Movie lover,This movie met my super hero expectations! I loved it. It's worth owning. A great end to the trio. Newer actors did a great job. The villain has a bright future. I enjoy all of his movies. He is a natural born gangster!
5,will watch more than once,"I was surprised that this movie was not all action and explosions, but rather a deep dark look into the inner turmoil of a man who has not yet found himself. There are twists and turns that you will not expect. The video is crisp and clean and the surround sound is definitely reference material. I bet you will watch this movie more than once."
3,eh,"to me the special effects were quite cheesy. They did little to develop any new characters, and the ending was ho hum. BOO"
3,Good but not the best.,This one was a bit confusing and definitely not as good as the previous Dark Knight movies. Cat Woman was a plus.
5,Dark movie.,"As in the previous Dark Knight movies, this one is also excellent. Great ending. Can't wait to see what they do next."
5,Great!,Bought this for my brother for Christmas and he loved it. It arrived very quickly even in the holiday rush.
3,Great Movie,Great movie but the sound was so low I had to but my volume up to 100 and still strugged to hear. In the end I had to turn on CC.
2,Too long and boring,I like Christian Bale but this movie is too long and boring. We had to watch it for two days and thought it was waste of time.
3,Lots of action!,I think some of the previous Batman movies were better but the action scenes were good in this movie. Lots of action!
3,sad news,after all the hoopla about this movie i give it's a c-.. i am sorry i bothered to pay for this.
5,Awesome movie!,"The second movie was the best of the three, but this finally raps everything up nicely. I would defiantly recommend this film."
4,Dark Knight a nice ride,"I thought Christian Bale did a nice job dichotimizing the role between a recluse and the comeback crusader. Anne Hathaway was a nice change of pace as Catwoman and did a great job with her role. I have no idea who played the Bane character but I thought he was great. All in all, a nice piece of entertainment."
4,Nice edition for any Dark Knight fan!,"Overall I found this collector's edition very well planned out except for the storage container for the discs. The container itself is nice and has a neat design, but there's no separation between the discs or any distinctive protection except for the outer shell. Basically you just pile/snap them in on eachother which is poor means for maintaining. Otherwise, the Bat cowl statue is the selling point obviously, It was well detailed and loved the cracks and separation points to make it look like it was trully broken by Bane!!"
1,Canb't figure out what all the fuss is about,The storyline is just pathetic! All the movie is is visual stunts. Stunts that if tried in the real world could not be accomplished. Americans can't think anymore so this movie will appeal to the masses.
4,The Movie? or Blu-Ray?,"According to the listing there are currently over 300 ""Reviews"" for this ""Product"".Myself I'm interested in finding out about the Blu-Ray, not reviews of the movie, as I've seen it and now I want to buy a copy, which I have. However, I see in the Amazon listing there are NO SPECIAL FEATURES which means the producers at some point will ask me to purchase yet another disc or download with those features.So without viewing the product I just purchased, same as the other reviewers, I will give it one star. I want extras on the Blu-Ray. I also just purchased MIB3 and it would seem that it has plenty of extras.Thanks for listening.OK, I received the Blu-Ray yesterday and it would appear to have 3 hours of ""Special Features"". However, the Amazon page for this film under ""Special Features"" still says ""None"".I'm looking forward to watching this this weekend."
2,Once again ripped off,"I only rate this a 2 because I found the movie to be thought provoking. It's the product itself that I find lacking. The disclaimer at the top states you cannot redeem your Digital Copy past December 4th 2012. That is the date of the release. What a rip off! It may be offered for half off but unless you get it (at a much higher cost) that same day you will be out half of what you paid for! Lame!And what is this shift to only put extras on Blue-Ray? I'm sorry that I can't afford the fancy HD, but that doesn't mean I don't want to see the extras as well. Once again I'll just get in line to rent it from the library. Or off Red Box. Or order it via my cable provider. Much cheaper!"
1,The Dark Knight... slumped,"This movie was wooden and slow, a sleeper of a bad movie. I had seen the other two movies in the trilogy and was eager to see the last one, to see how it caped the series. It had the normal amount of fantastic (but predictable) CGI but the somnolent actors plodded through their scenes in mechanical precision, picking up a paycheck for their efforts but not giving much in return. If you REALLY need to see this movie, borrow the disc from a friend but DON'T spend your hard earned money on it."
1,Waste of time,"The plot was convoluted, the dialogue was poorly written, and the acting was wooden, except for Anne Hathaway, who was fluid and feline without devolving to camp. And what is up with that ridiculous mask on the bad guy? And the forced, old-man-sounding voice that dubs in his speech? WTF? With a gimmick like the mask, there needs to be a pay-off; I kept waiting for an ""unmasking"" to reveal all the hideous deformities it was purported to hide. The final big, over-the-top confrontation between Batman and the bad guy looked promising for just such a reveal, but, alas, it never materialized. I found my mind wandering constantly in boredom, despite the explosions meant to entertain. Sophomoric, adolescent tripe is my ultimate rating of this waste of time and resources. Can we be done with the Batman theme now?"
2,where's the instant vid?,"so i preordered the instant video, it's past midnight west coast and no available link. Not too happy amazon. Up and waiting- I had to miss the in theater version because i was overseas with the military. Let's do this!"
1,What a crock of s***,Waste of time and money. This movie was made for brain dead idiots. Corny and predictable. What a shame so much talent and funds were spent on such crap.
3,Good movie - not great,"Good movie - not great. I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. In my opinion, it was not up to par with the previous Batman movies."
3,The Dark Knight Rises failed to impress,"I thought it was okay. I was not impressed overall. I felt that Bane's character could have been better developed, as well as that of the Catwoman. Visually it was exciting, but other than that I would say it was ""so-so"". Felt more like the boring knight than the dark knight"
3,Bruce Needs Therapy,Surprisingly dull. Boring villians. Hathaway is a good Catwoman but is in the wrong movie. Same thing happened to Miichelle Pfeiffer. Caine is good. Freeman is unnecessary. Bane is just an obligatory bad guy. Bale is too arrogant and smug to play psychologically tortured. Bruce Wayne is boring after awhile. Dull action scenes. Prison scenes go on forever. Movie overrelies on mood music. Certainly room for a 4th installment. Or maybe another reboot. There will be more Batman movies. Maybe they won't be pretentious and dull like this one.
3,Somewhat boring,"Hard to stay awake for entire show, To many low frequency audio effects (noise). Bad sequel. I think it was a disappointment."
2,Waste of Time,Don't waste your time on this movie it lacks a plot and is super boring. There are many better movies.
2,"too long, little of substance",The momentum from one and two was not able to be maintained. It lacked meaningful story and cohesion. Too many leaps of faith made the story unbelievable.
2,When will they stop making stupid sequels?,"This movie has promising moments but for the most part underdelivers. Bruce Wayne is an EMO crybaby throughout and gives up the superhero role entirely by the conclusion of the film.I never read the comics so maybe it i true to the storyline but, if so, I'm glad I didn't.What a crybaby-fest."
3,Just okay,Very dark and a lot of storyline to follow. Plus at almost three hours long it just felt way longer than it needed to be. Good graphics and nice story but there was an awful lot that I missed because the action was too fast or the screen was too dark.
4,The Dark Knight Rises,"Good movie ! I could not catch all the words, so It would be nice if Amazon can add subtittles or caption in the future."
3,Not my favorite incarnation of Dark Knight,"The action was fun but the overall character motivations were strained in my opinion. It was worth watching, but I am glad I waited to rent it instead of seeing it in theaters."
4,Amazon,Not sure if it was a problem with my wi-fi connection or someone hacks into you system but this is the second time a movie at the ending (which is pivotal to any great movie to say the least) it freezes up. Thanks for having such movies available . Wonderful performances great plot and keeps you in suspense.
4,"if you liked the others, prepare to sit longer to enjoy this installment",I love the Dark Knight series and this was no exception however if I were to make any criticism of this movie it would be the length of the film. I think my butt fell asleep trying to sit all the way through it!
4,The Dark Knight Rises keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"I had only seen the first Batman movie with Christian Bale, but even though I hadn't seen The Dark Knight, I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Dark Knight Rises and didn't feel like I'd missed anything. Really did keep me on the edge of my seat though! Would watch it again."
3,"Love these boots, but...","Love the look of these boots, but the rubber started splitting and cracking after a couple of years (which in Southern California means it was only worn maybe 20 times) - I still love my boots, but they wore very quickly for the price."
3,Amazingly cute!! But not so durable.,"I absolutely love these boots because they are so cute. I'm almost 30 and I still love things made for children- for myself, lol. Stuff like this is hard to find for in ""Really Big Kid"" sizes. But the pair I bought I went through in a couple of months. Granted I wore them almost every day. But the heel cracked within the first 2 weeks of having them. I would buy again because they were only like $29.00 when I got them. Beware though they do fall apart....One boot lost an eye toward the beginning of the second month having them. :("
4,comfy but shorter than expected,This is great to tromp around in but I was expected just a little below the knee height. Its mid-calf.
2,disappointment,disappointmenttheir short and very flimsywithin the first week of buying them there was a hole on the back part of the shoe
3,Loved them! Then the heel split :(,"I absolutely love these boots and, being in Seattle, they are extremely useful. After about 6 months of wear, the heel of the right boot split, however, including the lining. I did a number with some superglue and green duct tape, which has seemed to hold up. I haven't had any problems with leaky boots while splashing through the puddles.They are about $10 cheaper on Amazon than on the company's website . . . FYI. I <3 Amazon.com."
3,Loved the boots---Hated the rip,"I couldnt have been more thrilled to finally wear these awesome boots. I got compliments constantly. However after a month or so my boot ripped up the back and had a huge hole where water could get in. I was telling a friend about how upset i was when he told me his cousin had the same boots and the same problem.The boots are completely fabulous, but I cannot vouch for how long they will last."
1,What a bloomin shame!!,"I bought this D.V.D. Because late 70's ""punk"" Is something I've always been into. As another reviewer mentioned. ""Have You ever felt cheated?"" Yes!! Indeed I do feel cheated!! Who cares about The stuff that was on this D.V.D.?? An interview with Billy Idol?? ""What a sissy!!"" Anybody who want's to learn more, About how ""punk rock"" started. Won't learn anything worth knowing, From this D.V.D.!! If You are a ""punk rock"" fan... Maybe You'll see something on this D.V.D. You'll like?? But it's truly doubtful!!! I would have to say, Buying this D.V.D. is a waste of time and money!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"This is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons. First, there's the logistical problems. So much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband, both punk fanatics, wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was. Second is the truly unforgivable part and that's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events. I understand if you can't cover everyone, of course you can't, but they left out more than they included. Really disappointing...I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again."
3,"Great closure, great style, stainless steel not very attractive","This pair of earrings would be absolutely fabulous for sportsand long-term wear if it was made out of white or yellow gold,especially with a matte finish. I find I'm not wearing them much for sports,as was the intention, because of the look of the material (stainless steel)."
5,Perfect deep fryer for a large family,"This deep fryer is large enough to cook enough fried food for a family of 6. It has a quick return to cooking temp when you need to make a second batch of food. The unit is light weight and clean up is very easy. I was a little hesitant at first because the temp only goes to 375 but everything that I've cooked (fries, wings, nuggets, etc..) have cooked fine. The food always fries crisp - battered/breaded items are not soggy."
1,Trash Avoid.,This product does not work at all. Pure garbage. Do not waste money on this get something better from Black and Decker or anything else.
4,The second coming of Detroit garage rock...,"This is one of the most highly influential yet unheralded bands to come out of Detroit in the early 1990's. The sound was essentially the rebirth of garage style R&R; to come from Detroit's infamous underground music scene. Along with the Gories this is the band that paved the way for the Go, the White Stripes, the Detroit Cobras and a number of other loud, greasy, not pretty groups.The songs on this CD are comprised of material released starting in the early 90's, with Bum Ticker and Scabby being their first recording around 1993, while the track Queen Cobra appeared on the 1997 sound track to the Traci Lords garage rock movie classic Full Blast.No collection of Detroit garage rock is complete without this recording."
3,3 's across the board...,"I remember how excited I was to get my hands on this one a few years back. Their first two CD's I had tracked down here also, and was hoping for more of the same.Although there are some good songs on here, not much measure up to the feast of melody and funk from their first two Cd's. Sure, ""Mountains and Sunsets"" is fairly good track, and even the title has a psychedelic funky vibe to it right? But I find it difficult to find many great songs.It is a decent disc, the songs ""Sleeping In The Worlds Smallest Bed"", and ""Freewheelin'"" are up there also but I always have to skip over a few songs each time to get to them. It does have it's high points, just not as many as in the other two discs.So it's their 3rd album, and I basically like 3 songs on it, so I gave it 3 stars. Not sure it even matters at this point since it is apparently out of print, and not many people even knew who they were when this was first released."
2,Why wait so long?,"I can't really understand why Mr Dilts thought he had to write this book at all since what it does is re-present some of the most basic NLP techniques as though they were something brand new. Mr Dilts actually tells us at one point that the ideas he is explaining were formulated in 1980 or thereabouts and so it seems sort of strange that this book came out in 1999. Why wait so long? And why go over again material which because of the long delay is now the core material for every book that calls itself an introduction to NLP?BTW it is slightly inaccurate to suggest that Mr Dilts is anything less than a ""well established"" author on NLP. He was involved with the group at Santa Cruz which originally developed NLP, and his earliest books date back at least as far as 1980 when he wrote 'NLP Volume 1' along with Bandler, Grinder and Judith DeLozier. At least ten of his books, probably more, are still in print. Are there any other NLP writers who can rival those statistics?"
5,Yet another excellent book from Robert...,"If you want to learn to use the Sleight of Mouth patterns to create a world to which people want to belong or if you want to just improve your ability to influence yourself and others, this book provides an entertaining read and a thorough methodology to improve and enhance the ways you use language.Robert is known for being respectful as much as he is known for his competence. These are some of the qualities that shine throughout the presentations of the patterns.I've studied with some of the elite of this technology (NLP) and I place this volume with the best of the best of whats available."
2,Much Ado,"I was very disappointed with this book. Although the writing is competent, the story could have been written as a short story. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a psychological thriller in the tradition of Spider or Butcher Boy. I found this to be a simple exercise in an overly long dramatic monologue."
2,This novel starts slow & then goes nowhere,This novel starts slow & then goes nowhere. He uses an interesting 1st person lit device but that gets boring rapidly. AVOID.
1,"Awful, awful, awful","I'm sorry - I absolutely loved ""Instance"" and was hoping for something of comparable caliber. Instead I found myself dreading the time I would waste slogging through it. Sort of the way I felt about Michael Chabon's ""The Final Solution"" when half-way through I realized that that's all there is and what a shame to waste the energy writing even a novella on so flimsy a framwork.Lewis Libby's ""The Apprentice"" is a better rendition of the ""slender little mystery elevated towards art"" genre which isn't really saying all that much.Spend your time reading ""An Instance of the Fingerpost"" twice."
5,"Good, Inexpensive Repair item","I bought a beater car to drive to and from work, however the headliner looked like a badger tried to eat the fabric. I found this and a can of adhesive here on Amazon and set out to resolve that issue. I stripped the old one off (it was MUCH thinner than this one) and replace it. It took about 45 minutes, the longest part removing screws and waiting for adhesive layers to dry. It went on easily when I used a plastic squeegee to push down the material smoothly. The sounds inside the car have even seemed to soften a touch, but it could just be the way the inside just looks a lot nicer. An easy repair/upgrade to your old, dessicated headliner. Highly recommended."
2,The three way touch sensor does not work properly.,"Like previous reviews for this lamp and the table lamp version, the three way touch sensor does not work properly. It is either on or off and when it's on the light is very dim, not anywhere close to 120 watts (3 X 40 watts). I have contacted Adesso Lighting, by email, they told me to return the lamp. Otherwise it is a nice looking lamp for a cheap price, with a 20% off promotion. I'm going to keep the lamp and replace the touch control, Thomas & Betts AR135D Touch Lamp Kit $6.90 at amazon; that should fix the problem. In my opinion it's a decent lamp, if you can get it for under $100."
3,Only two settings,"This is not a three-way-lamp with a dimmer switch, but one with two settings on and off. I purchased the lamp to go in my new livingroom and I like it because of the soft glow and elegant style. The touch sensor works well when using the correct kind of bulbs. Yet the light is not quite bright enough to read by."
4,For the older children (5 and up),"We love it. Other parents love it. Older children love it. The whistle is fun. It's still in perfect condition after five months of minimal play from our one-year-old, but I can't imagine that it would hold up to rigorous wear and tear."
1,Egg Boiler Much Worse Than It Looks,"After the FIRST use the teflon coating started to bubble up and after the FIRST WEEK it looked as if were decades old!It looks nice on the outside, makes consistently perfect hard or soft boiled eggs BUT it looks like crap after a week!"
2,Teflon coating comes off quickly.,"While I liked how this machine worked (eggs were cooked just like I wanted them), the coating did come off after just a short time of use. I'm not sure if using the unit afterwards is healthy or safe so I threw it out. I'm shopping for a different cooker."
4,Love this little thing!,"This little egg cooker is the best, the eggs come out perfect every time. I promise you that it is not just another gadget to collect dust in the back of the kitchen cabinet. If you love HB eggs, egg salad, etc. then you will love this. No more watching that pot on the stove....:)"
3,Easy to break racks.,"The product does make egg boiling way easier. However, the rack is very easy to break. Mine broke within 4 months. :( Just figure that I would want to inform people about it...."
1,Defects common??,"My old egg boiler like this was flawless. I gave the old one to my daughter, ordered this one, and it was defective. Do not know if defects are common in these or not. I ended up replacing with a brand that also poaches. The price on this egg boiler is great and if you get one that works, you will love it."
1,Jeff is hot but this is not,"Jeff seems like a nice guy, and he's got a handsome face, hot body, and sexy tattoo...but this debut album is really, really bad - his flat, nasal vocals are so thin they literally evaporate while you attempt to listen to each leaden, plodding song. Try Nick Lachey's solo CDs instead for the true sound of 98 Degrees."
3,So-So,"Not bad for a break-out CD trying to kick start a solo career. The music is standard 98 Degrees fare, but the real treat here lies in the pictures."
1,Nice To Look At But No Voice,"I used to enjoy listening to 98 Degrees back in their heyday and always thought Nick and Jeff were great (vocally) together, Sadly Jeff's solo endeavor is so bad that it was released twice and with the same resounding thud. The songs are uninspiring and he clearly needs to find a new style. Of course I hope that he does not go the way of JC Chasez's Schizophrenic mess. I think Jeff has a pleasant voice but he needs to probably use those good looks for modeling or acting. Sorry Jeff!"
1,I'm a huge 98 Degree fan and this was TERRIBLE!,"I'm sorry to say but this album was terrible. I was so excited to find out about Jeff Timmons solo cd since I was always a fan of 98 Degrees. I really thought this cd would be good. It's not. His voice is thin and limited and he falls flat on a lot of the songs. the songs are boring boring boring. There is not one song on here that I could recommend listening too. The ballads almost put me to sleep and the uptempo songs are plagued with cheesy production. Go back and listen to your 98 Degrees albums, or even go listen to Nick Lacheys not nearly as dreadful album. I wish I could find something nice to say about this album, but it really was terrible."
4,Worthy of Hunter Thompson,"With a tag line of ""Hot rod juvenile delinquents and amazona from outer space have come to Memphis to kill hippies"", I just couldn't say no. Lots of 60's/70's nudity, rock-n-roll, & violence with sequences and transitions that make the whole thing seem like an acid trip. Best advice I can give is to have 3 beers before starting the movie and keep going as you watch it."
1,This DOES have msg!,Autolyzed Yeast Extract is listed in the ingredients - that is another name for MSG. I was all excited to find a gravy mix MSG free and then saw that. Be sure to read the labels if you are MSG sensitive.
4,Gravy is DELISH but SHORT-CODED!,"I really believe that expiration codes should be listed on products that are in need of being used fairly quickly. I ordered a case of this and thought about ordering all three available...glad I didn't. While the product is really good, I'm not sure we'll be able to use it all before the exp date is up, which is a month. I figure we'll use it over the holidays, and it won't be far out of date...but...if this is a concern to you, I'd make sure I had a couple of family friends, etc to go in on buying a case of this to split with you. It's a great deal and an excellent product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of being so short-coded. Not sure I should take a star away from the product review because of the exp date issue but thought it was fair to let you know before you order."
1,I agree,Everything you read below is true 69. Becuz this song is anoying it gets like that really quickly. Chingy should just stop rappin or singin cuz he is horrible. I agree.
4,Bateria,"bateria de larga duracion para las videograbadoras, la recomiendo al 100% aunque es un poco grande es igual a la original y por supuesto dura mas tiempo"
1,"one of the worst books I have ever read - completely useless...,","This book offers very little insight and simply states the obvious. You will read page after page of over-generalized, useless information. The chapter on laundry lists 12 brands of laundry detergent. So what? I thought that this book would offer not only guidance and insight pertaining to the philosophy of simplifying, I thought it would offer useful, practical advice. It offers neither. It spends more time telling you that life is complicated without delving into how you can actually simplify it. I already know its complicated! Furthermore, the book is rife with sentences like this; ""State-of-the-art washing machines and dryers are readily available. If you don't have them in your home, then you can go to a nearby coin laundry."" Really? I totally needed a book to figure that out, thank you!"
2,"Some helpful tips, but mostly chock full of the obvious.","Although I admire Jeff Davidson's ambition in this book (he tries very hard to cover almost every aspect of an individual's space), this same determination to have something to say no matter how thin the premise leads to the basic weakness of the book - it is full of painfully obvious ""suggestions"". For example, to simplify the washroom, he suggests hanging a shower caddy, installing non-slip flooring, etc. For the bedroom, adding drawer dividers, using a nightstand, hanging up your clean clothes, etc. - Come on, these are all suggestions from a 1950 Ladies' Home Journal. I wish I could find more positive things to say, as I understand how difficult it is write a book at all, but I cannot honestly say that I got anything positive from Mr. Davidson's book. If you're looking for a life-changing tome on money matters and frugality, you're much better off with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robins's ""Your Money or Your Life."""
1,Kindle Version is not right,"Downloaded the free sample of the Kindle Version, but I won't be buying it. The formatting did not translate, leaving an unreadable electronic text. Buyer beware - read the sample first."
2,Complicated,"I've been reading a few books on how to scale back and simplify life and this was one book that was recommended to me. I was disappointed with a lot of his advice. He referred to a lot of other author's ideas as 'absurd advice'. He thought it was absurd for women to scale back their wardrobe to just a few items. For me, I think it makes perfect sense no matter what type of job you have. Have you seen a man's closet? They can get away with it... yet he thinks women can't.Even something as simple as choosing to not make the bed he thinks is silly. If not making your bed will make things simpler for you, then don't. It's a personal choice and for some people it can be a stressful thing. Just think of it as airing out the sheets.If you want to simplify your life, don't read his book. It will just add to the clutter."
5,BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES,THIS DVD IS ONE OF THE FEW MUSIC DVDS THAT CAPTURE THE FEEL OF A BANDS SHOW. I SAW U2 DURING THE JOSHUA TREE TOUR AND WATCHING THIS DVD BROUGHT BACK ALOT OF MEMORIES OF HOW INCREDIBLE THEY ARE LIVE. THE SOUND IS GREAT AND THE SO IS THE CAMERA WORK. ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN U2 LIVE SHOULD OWN THIS DVD.
5,"If you're a U2 fan, look no farther my friend.","Remarkable atmosphere and emotion. Bono's a rare breed that can make a performance in front of 80,000 people personal, intimate, and polished. This is 'A sort of homecoming' for U2, after the death of Bob Hughson (Bono's Dad) and really packs a punch. The band is terrific, and Bono is as animated and charged as ever. Kite, Out of control, One, and Walk On are especially fabulous. This performance is my favorite U2, and a real gem."
2,Where's the Popmart In Mexico City DVD?,"This is the second DVD from the Elevation Tour, with mostly redundant setlists from the Boston DVD.The music and sound quality are superb, but the camera work is the typical MTV-style flashy, fast-cut-jumble where nothing stays in place for more than one second (just like the Boston DVD). If that type of editting annoys you, be prepared for lots of it, including extremely grating close-ups of Bono's face during one song I can't remember, due to dizziness and eye-strain, this video is mostly a visual blur.A wiser decision would have been to release this show as a limited collector's item for the U2 Fanclub, and release the visually superior and more musically inspiring ""Popmart From Mexico City"" finally on DVD instead.5 stars for the musical content, 0 stars for the editting and camera work."
5,Electrifying performance in their Irish homeland,"U2 has been a personal favorite of mine for many years. This is the first time I've seen a performance in/from Ireland. U2 was clearly enjoying the night with the fans that have loved them since the beginning. A Time magazine writer once wrote that a U2 concert was part rock show and part religeous experience. This DVD captures that feeling much like the Red Rocks video did. However, unlike Red Rocks which was dominated by U2's humanist, often angry perspective, Slane Castle captures U2's uplifting, contemporary blend of humanism, humor, & political activism. Life is challenging these days, and this DVD provides a brief respite while subtly reminding the viewer of the scope of humanity. Only U2 could do both! My only criticism is that the DVD is only 2 hours long, not 2 days!"
5,Unbriddled energy,The energy of the crowd and the band makes the concert truly special. After seeing this concert I would be interested in seeing U2 in Ireland --- there was a true connection here that I have not seen in other U2 concert videos. Amazing video.
3,Not as shown in description,"The title says that this edition is in a jewel case. However, it is not. Amazon sent me a replacement and the same item was sent.THe DVD is of a great concert but dont order the jewel case as it is just the usual clear plastic case."
2,"Popmart blew this ""mainstream"" tour away.","""All that you can't leave behind"" is a lame boring album.The concert is so ""happy and everything is fine.""Popmart tour is way better than this."
1,Didnt really Happen!!!,Somebody just had a dream that they were a rock star and captured it on this DVD. Was 1 star good or bad?
2,Almost Unwatchable,"The video quality of this product was aweful. The lighter areas are completely blown out and all detail is lost. The lighting, though appropriate for the event, is horrific in terms of photography. The only gem here is Out of Control, the rest is rubbish we've all heard over and over again."
1,No B.A.D. No Dice !!!,"My son brought this home and put it on the 6.1 Surround system. I asked if ""BAD"" (You know, the song that 'made' U2?) was on the set list. He said: ""no"", I said: ""Turn it off, take it out and throw it away."" I don't want to see or hear anymore of Bono's egotistical jive. Either you ROCK in my house, or you're outta here! And this time...Thumbs down on this ""loser"" Concert DVD. Pure sell-out garbage. Go away U2. Quit taking up other people's air!"
4,"Better than ""ELEVATION 2001/U2 Live From Boston""","I haven't been to a U2 concert before and it seems like the band doesn't have any plans on stopping by the Philippines any time soon, so, the closest thing I could get to seeing them LIVE would be through their commercial DVD releases. Although the Boston DVD have its moments (live performances of ""Gone"", ""Stay"" and ""The Fly"" were the most notable) the Slane DVD is far superior to its predecessor for several obvious reasons: the anamorphic widescreen and DTS audio really captures the band at its best Elevation Tour ever caught on film. The set list really works better with the inclusion of ""New Year's Day"", ""Staring At The Sun"", ""Pride"" and ""One"". The band's chemistry, constant humor, the sad ""Kite"" tribute to Bono's dad (who recently died before the first Slane gig) and a fantastic audience made this DVD a classic and definitely a must-have."
4,U2 have as much fun as the crowd,"this is simply a fantastic live spectacle from one of the great bands of rock. there is an absolute and undeniable exchange of energy between the band and this audience, it's hard to tell who's enjoying themselves more; the band or the fans. because of it the show is real joy to watch and listen to. i'm by no means an authority on U2 shows or the band for that matter, i just love great rock-n-roll whatever flavor it comes in, but the set list here and the spirit and alacrity that they give the performance is just stellar. if all U2 shows are this fun, i'm definately going to catch the next tour. the unforgettable fire documentary on the disc is also enjoyable in that it shows the band before they got to be super rock stars with all of the money and beauty that comes with it. they're just 4 rock dorks living for the sake of the song, the sound and the moment, which of course, is where all great art is generated."
4,"Excellent, Passionate Performance","I slammed the U2's 360 Rose Bowl blu-ray for many different reasons, but I can't slam this dvd at all. Perhaps the word passion can best explain what makes this dvd a better show. Bono oozes passion for his home-country crowd. I like the set list better too, Pride(In The Name Of Love) just about brought tears to my eyes(me! crusty old me!) The only flaw would be the video quality in some of the scenes(blu-ray has spoiled me I guess)Despite the below average quality of many scenes I will probably grab this dvd before the 360 blu-ray when I need a U2 fix."
3,"The 8/25 show should be on this, not 9/1","It's ok. I would've rather seen the August 25th Show at Slane. With highlights like A Sort of Homecoming and Dancing in the Moonlight (by Thin Lizzy, who U2 opened for 20 years ago at Slane)."
3,timing and venue is not everything - get 'Live in Boston',"Sure, this concert is considered a historic homecoming, lodged tightly between the death of Bono's father and 9/11. However, with all of its imperfections (most of us saw shows better than the two that were documented from the 2001 tour), the 'U2 Live in Boston' DVD represents a better performance and better song selection.This DVD also includes a rather overrated documentary on the making of the rather overrated 'Unforgettable Fire', but I would characterize this as a plus only for those insane U2 completists like me."
4,"Good, not great, setlist.","At this show, the band is clearly having fun and that's nice to see. In my opinion, the setlist is a bit pedestrian and the DVD as a whole is not as good as their most recent U2 LIVE IN CHICAGO, but it's another solid performance from a great band."
4,"A deep and powerful film brushing issues of loyalty, honor..","A Simple portrayal of a man's duty, and complexity to stay with his mission, or drift with his heart make this film great.From the start and to the end, just a stunning performance around every corner despite the foggy settings of Western Europe.I reveal little plot in my review cause that will spoil viewers experience but Rourke's better performances as a rough and tumbleassassin named ""Falon"", who has to do one more job before a crime lord, who runs his mortuary keeps him around."
2,"ehhh, so-so","it's a so-so film with Rourke in the IRA. Some good stuff. Look for Anthony(Stewart Head) as Rupert(note: Anthony Stewart Head portraits another Rupert...Rupert Giles on the TV show Buffy The Vampire Slayer)so, now you know. but this one is so-so like I said"
3,One of the better for Mickey Rourke,"A pretty good interpretation of the book.A hit man's on the run from everybody, the police want him for muder, and terrorists want him for refusal to murder,a good catch-22.Mickey Rourke is trapped, who to trust, who to trust?"
4,green hair,"This is an old movie with a timeless message-differences, no matter what they are, should never be the cause of separation/strife between people. Good movie and enjoyable."
3,"JOSEPH LOSEY, OPUS ONE","Pacifistic and antiracist parable. If you forget Pat O'Brien's clownings and some overdramatic scenes, you'll still have some meat on the bone left here. The scene in the barbershop when Peter Fry has his hair cut off is perfectly well shot. No word spoken but roaring bad consciences. A curiosity. Recommended."
5,Great for Men Bible Study!,"I am a member of an 65 men Saturday morning bible study group. We are going into our fourth week. I am a Deacon at our church and I have been a Deacon at two churches for the past 20 years. Dr. Evans book brings out so much that a man can not but feel that he is having a closer walk with GOD by reading this book. It helps one understand that GOD wants you to do things that you never thought of. But, you must break out of your shell. You must stand up on your own two feet. Think big the way GOD wants you to. Like the book say not making excuses and just do it.Thanks,Bruno"
2,didn't finish it,Not very well written. Metaphors in the book don't always correlate to the idea he is trying to explain. There are better books out there on this topic. (start with the Bible. )
5,No More Excuses- A Must Read,Dr. Tony Evans speaks to men ina way we women could never connect. It is a must read for every man who thinks God can't use you. Think again. Stop the excuses.
5,Great Book for Men looking to grow,This is a great book for men seeking to grow into the man God would have them to be.
5,Becoming the man God wants me to be,"This is absolutely the best book that I have ever read that clearly, and often humorously, puts into perspective the excuses that we often use to block our relationship with God. From sexual immorality to not spending quality time with our children, Dr.Evans in an easily understood format using Bibical figures as examples outlines the dangers of using excuses for our sins."
1,Not what it claims,"I purchased this printer based on its compatibility with my new laptop and the Amazon reviews. Sad to say, but after 3 hours with HP tech support one day and 4-1/2 hours the next, it just wouldn't work. We could not load the printer driver due to a set-up error message that insisted my laptop did not have Explorer 5 or better. It's a brand new laptop with Explorer 7. So either the software is not a match with the Vista operating system or 2 printers and 2 laptops are defective - doubtful. For the money, I expected a great deal more.FYI: I don't think the tech support from HP is that effective. They really didn't seem to know what they were doing. Too bad; it was a perfect size printer for my needs."
5,HP 400WF,Printer is excellent for mobil use. Just have to make sure the networks seeting is HP each time you fire it up but prints nicely and is compact.
1,Only thing worse than the printer is the customer service TERRIBLE,"I have owned a dozen HP printers over the years and just bought a 460wf. The printer has been nothing but trouble. I am fairly computer literate and was unable to connect to the computer wirelessly following the basic instructions. After 6 hours with ""customer service"" I was able to get it set up and working. The tech support people (the 6th group I spoke to) said it was ""faulty drivers"". 5 weeks later the problem returned. When I called to get a product return number I was told that it was too late to return the item. I then called customer service who told me that the warranty had expired (false). The offshore customer support techs were basically automons who could not speak English. Unless your time has no value this customer support is WORTHLESS. This is the worst printer I have ever had (not that it prints) and the customer support is so bad I will NEVER buy HP again. Do yourself a favor and buy any other printer."
4,Review of HP 460wf mobile printer,We use this product in a truck with a laptop computer. It works very well for us.
4,function as promised . . .,"A little heavy, particularly for the every day traveler. More useful as a printer for those who have limited space and use a laptop. I use it with my MACBOOK PRO. Had no trouble setting it up. Prints quickly for such a small device. Transfer time is quick. Certainly useful up to 15 pages or so. I wouldn't use if for any major print jobs."
5,Sized right,Travel? This printer is great. Right size and gives clear prints. Packs in my carry-on with the rest of my equipment. Highly recommend.
4,it smokes,"when people think of ratt, dancing undercover may not be the first album they think of, more likely it's out of the cellar..but this album kicks, and in the late ' 80's hard rock/hair metal explosion, it may have been a little overlooked. ratt songs always had some of the best hooks and guitar riffs in rock. body talk and slip of the lip are very cool songs, and the song that starts it off, dance, just kicks in with that first verse. if you are driving while listening, you will be forced to travel at a high rate of speed..it's just one of those songs that sounds so cool at high volume in your ' 79 impala. ok ok..so i'm re-living my high school years..oh well. if you like ratt but don't have dancing undercover, just order the damn thing!"
3,Overall A Decent Album,"Every song on here is listenable, but only a handful leave an impression. I've always thought that the playing on this album was good, plus the overall sound and production. Stephen Pearcy truly had a voice all his own. Best songs are ""Dance,"" ""Slip of the Lip,"" and ""Body Talk."" Overall, this is an average album, but it still rocks."
1,Price is way too high,"Please tell me no one really pays this price for Pacific Hazelnut drink! The drink itself is great, we keep it in the house all the time, I use it in my coffee, we use it in baking,and my kids drink it straight when we don't have fresh goats milk to drink. We pay, at the most, $2.61 for this exact item, same brand, same size, same everything through a food co-op and I have seen it at groceries for around $3-$3.50.The actual product would get 5 stars but because of the price it only gets 1."
4,LIQUID NUTELLA WITHOUT THE REFINED SUGAR,"As far as taste,it exceeds all the other non-dairy milks. Warning: hard to put away once you start! Unique, ambrosial, comfort-food.I agree w/the other reviewers regarding pricing. In the NJ/NY market, it can be had for under $3.50 per quart.Treat yourself to a ""nut-ella"" liquid experience!"
3,Great Debut.,Josh Bates has come out with a great debut CD released on Beech Street Records(home of Casting Crowns) Has some great songwriting and is a rock/pop album with some acoustic songs. All songs are very God centered and can easily be sung in a contemporary praise and worship setting. I look for great thing for Bates in the future.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!,"We currently have two HP printers in our office. One is an HP Color Laser Jet 2605dn. This worked for about a year (just until out of warranty). Now it has developed mirror issues and won't print magenta(HP tech support was useless), and I either have to tear it apart myself, or junk it. THE OTHER, an HP K550, has been a complete nightmare from day one. It did not work straight out of the box, and had to spend hours with support just to get it working. Some error in the software that comes with the machine. Now that it's ""working"", it continuously misfeeds, and eats up printer ink like crazy! Actually, it shows that there is about 1/3 ink left in the cartridges, but it will not print until you replace the cartridge. I have never had any printer go through ink like this thing. It is an aweful, money-eating frusteration. I will NEVER, EVER buy HP again."
1,BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE FRUSTRATION,"I've had this printer for about two months, and to date I would guess it's been out of order for at least 1/2 that time. Not only did I start with the usual black/yellow printhead problem and waste 25% of my ink cartridges just getting it running, but as soon as it started working properly it started spitting out blank sheets of paper and giving me the paper jam error message. One replacement (refurbished) machine later, after a solid two weeks it stopped altogether and told me the door was open; per HP technical support I had to uninstall/reinstall my USB ports! As if that wasn't enough frustration, why would HP make a printer that ceases to function just because one of the print cartridges runs out?"
1,Do not buy this printer,I have owned this printer for 6 months. I regret not having returned it to Staples when I first began to have problems which was when I first began to use it.The primary issue for me is paper feed issues. The printer contantly feeds multiple sheets of paper. It is impossibe to print a multiple page document correctly particularly if you want to print double sided. Firmware upgrades etc. have not helped. I am surprised that HP is still selling this product.If you buy this printer you will regret it!
2,I hate this printer!,"It's fast, clean, and it's not a terrible cartridge-eater (like my Canons have been). That's what is good about this printer. It grabs blank pages all the time, no matter what paper is used (perhaps because it's so aggressively fast), it is temperamental, oversized, accessing and changing the paper tray is more hassle than it should be, and I probably shouldn't dislike it as much as I do, but I just hate it."
4,Quality Printer,I found this printer lounging around a Salvation army thrift store for $15. When I brought it home I noticed it was printing poorly. The driver diagnosed a bad black/yellow printhead. I orderd a new one and this thing has been printing fantastically ever since. The best $50 (uncluding printhead and black ink) I've ever spent. The only issue I have is that the paper is a little clunky to load as it is covered by the output tray. Other than that it prints fantastic photos and text and is lightning fast. This printer is out of date now but if you find one for a good price you won't be disappointed.
1,Broken Engineering Don't Buy an HP OfficeJet Pro Series,"I am sitting here spending more time on this printer because it is more important for me to take away money from HP than do something else in my life.This printer, when I first received it, was giving me print head errors when I first got it. I called HP and they immediately sent me a replacement unit. I THOUGHT it was simple a good support policy, but what they did NOT reveal was the replacement was due to the fact these printers almost always fail, due to defective parts and engineering. I just wasted another $180 on print heads because I was told I could either buy a support contract or buy print heads.This machine does not have defective print heads. It has defective sensors that cannot be replaced.Do not buy this printer. Consider Epson."
1,Piece of junk,"I'm sick of adding broken printers to landfill, but I'm getting ready to toss this one into the dumpster after one year. The paper feed jams about 50% of the time, then it won't pick up paper. After 3 months I had to jury rig the back door so it would stay in place without turning the printer off ( there's something wrong with the switch there ). Stay away from this product!"
4,Fast Printer for a good price,"I shopped around and found most places were selling this same printer for $200+, so buying it from amazon for $139 with free shipping was a good deal. It's heavy and a little bulky, so be sure you have room to store it. This printer is super fast with color and black text (with great ink life thus far), I have not printed any photos from it as it was purchased to make invitations at work. I did however have to spend 45min with tech support to figure out why when printing color text there was a shadowing effect under the letters. If you buy this printer, be sure to update the firmware version immediately to save you the trouble. Sine I downloaded the update, it's been printing everything perfect."
1,it's not worthy of burning,"This is our second go around with this printer series. Both times I have to say I truly am disappointed. We only use HP's for my printers in my work facility for the offices. I thought I would buy this printer for some lightweight color printing for the HR department who needed color but not a full blown LaserJet color printer. This printer has been out of commission for all of 5 days in the last 8 months. Upon setting up the replacement printer it ground to a halt on the priming process and started kicking out 2 and 3 pieces of paper at a time, the print heads are clogged and the unit in my book is useless. As I stated in the title for this review if this printer was made of wood, I would not use it for firewood, it's not worthy of burning."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I purchased 3 of these printers for our company. They all have different problems. One printer I only used a couple of days before it stopped working. Bottom line, save yourself lots of headaches and seek something else."
1,Never work out of the box.,"I just got this yesterday (06-16-06) and so for it hasn't printed anythingin black. In the past 21 hours I spent 3 hours with HP, most of it on hold. Before calling HP I had already did all of the recommend setup and maintenance. I came to the concluesion that the Y/B pin head was not working. When I finaly was able to talk with a human who was in the rightdept. I told her what I had done and ask for a new print head. After 11/2 hours they agreed that I was right and they will send me a new pin head,however it will take a week to get it.I am not without a printer, hooked back up my old relibable HP 895cxi.Keep tuned for the continuing story."
1,Stay Away,I thought I got a good deal by paying 79$ new...wrong! It is a cool looking printer...prints fast....but does not do photo printing well at all. Each and every picture shows the lines the print head made while printing. Big mistake...I will return it immediately.
1,Broke after just 20 pages,"This pathetic printer wend bad after just 20 pages. First the black color came out only in stripes, then disappeared completely. Like a fool, I spent $35+ to buy a new black ink cartridge (which won't fit a better printer), only to find that the real problem was internal and could not be fixed."
1,Buyer beware,This printer is fast and gives good quality printing when it works. It has very serious paper feeding issues. It it is very prone to jams and even more to double feeds. These issues have been unsolvable.It is awkard to load paper and even more so if you wish to print envelopes.If you buy this prepare to be unhappy.
2,paper gobbler,"Having tossed my ink drinking Canon out the window, I thought I would return to HP. Reliable, not superb print quality like a good Epson, but fast. Unfortunately, the paper feeding device of this HP is clumsy and apparently pretty backward. I have more misfeeds than I used to have on earlier printers. The paper feed is not easy to use nor to change for sizes other than letter size. The ink disappears pretty quickly as well. So whatever I have made up on speed, I lose having to rerun documents to get them to print each page on only one sheet of paper. What has happened that we cannot even produce a better printer than what we used to have? I will probably not buy another HP printer after this."
3,Frequent jammer,"We printed an envelope last week, and since then have not been able to get this thing to print on letter size paper again without a jam. HP's toolbox gives instructions as to how to fix it, but to no avail. Very frustrated with product."
1,One to avoid at any cost,"I've been using this printer for nearly a year. It worked pretty well for the first 6 months, but went downhill after that.The upper feed tray still works pretty well with 8.5x11 paper, but the lower tray will not feed without assistance, and 30% of the time ends in a jam and ink soaked mess.Even after firmware upgrades and cleaning everything I can reach without resorting to hand tools for disassembly, it is still a terrible machine. Time to trash this unit and try again."
2,Great printing; lousy paper handling,Do NOT purchase the optional Plain Paper Tray. Waste of time and money.
1,the pirinter did not do screen prints total waste of money,I gave the printer away as the person that sold it to me would not return my phone calls and the printer would not do print screeen shots
3,Decent Quality,"I've had this printer for over a week now and it hasn't jammed or anything. I did notice that sometimes there is black/yellow smearing from the printheads. I expected better quality, but overall, it's decent for the cost per black printed page; what is it--like 1.5 cents??? Can't complain."
3,"I Agree With Everyone...this is not an ""Annual""","Let's see...this shouldn't even be called an Annual...none of this songs are hits of 2003, and most of them are plaine borring long irritating mixes. There's about 5/24 songs I like which are ""Deepest Blue,"" ""Love Me Right,"" ""Burned With Desire,"" ""As the Rush Comes,"" and ""Pretty Green Eyes"" the rest are either ok or they just suck...I'd recommend the UK edition...now that is a good compilation."
1,Dumpster Eligible,"One of the worst MOS album I have ever purchased. Picked it up at the Virgin store by mistake, thought it was the Aussy import version (same cover design as last year but no gold color) but turns out, it was the US version. The tracks are less, the selection is poor, and the mixing was mediocre. My initial investment went straight down to the drain. It seems every MOS album that are targeted towards the U.S. market is always worse than the UK ones. If the 3 disc set UK version of The Annual 2004 is as bad as some reviewers said, then this one is a total trash worthy, in other words, worst of the worst. I am going to put it on eBay and hope I'll get some money back. I am not even going to make a MP3 copy of it, it's that bad. If you take your hard earned money seriously, don't spend it on this album. Or buy it at your own risk."
2,Not really sure,"Some stuff is pretty good, but some stuff you just shake your head at.This CD has 22 tracks TOTAL. The Ministry of Sound Annual 2004 on the MoS website has 3 cd's. 21 Tracks per cd. 63 tracks vs. 22. And the majority of songs on this compilation AREN'T on the Annual on the website... funny. Maybe Ultra Records gets to make their own Annual under the MoS name.I am dissapointed with this cd however. Yeah it has some good tracks, but the rest are mediocre at best. And I don't wanna here Elton John singin' about bein' ready for love... *shudder*"
5,Simply Amazing,"If you live in Miami know what like Party 93.1's music sounds like and love it, you'll love this cd set. Besides tracks like deepest blue and girlfriend, there's a bunch of fresh tracks that they don't air. I personally think disc 2 was better - had a better sound to it, but the entire set was great - definitely worth the $. I looked for it at Best Buy and it was the only copy hiding behind some other cds in the dissapointingly small dance section."
2,really???,"It is not what I expected it was just a really cheap toy. I really should have just saved my money. But, at least it was cheap."
3,"A Good, not Excellent, CD","There are good songs on this CD (""I Can't Wait"", ""Point of No Return""), but there are also some sleepers on it (like ""Secret Message""... zzzz...). Anyway, the CD is worth getting... it's an above-average CD still, but like most CDs, a few sleepers."
2,Two great songs on this rare CD,"""Point of No Return"" is fantastic, ""I Can't Wait"" a little less so. Whatever happened to this band?The two tracks above are worth the modest purchase price."
2,Half Way To Being A Great Album.,"This group was pretty good. It's sad that they stopped making albums. They had one major hit off this album and it was ""Point of No Return"". That song is very good and it's the only reason that I ordered this album. If you like this song as much as I do, I would recommend finding it on a compilation album, that way, you can hopefully get many other good songs along with it.Christopher P. AmodeoLong Island, N.Y."
2,average but catchy,well lets be real here there are two really catchy songs and they stand out.Don't Let Me be the one & of course one of the baddest and rarest Bass Jams from the 80's I Can't Wait.cuz the Synths took over at will and sadly the music hasn't recovered.
4,Most people ignore the best song.....,"The only reason I bought this cd was so I could have a copy of ""Point Of No Return"". It is by far the best and only decent song on the cd. They were, indeed, a One-Hit-Wonder, but their real hit - regardless of the ""charts"" - was ""Point Of No Return""."
2,Beat Biters.,"To bad that their only hit ""I can't wait"" was sampled from ""I can't wait (to rock the mic) By Spyder D & DJ Doc, beat for beat. I feel bad when people spend so much time creating and other people pay them close to nothing and cash in."
5,Walker Review,"This is a back in the day song, which was quite popular; great to dance to, but I use it for when I do my walking exercise. It is just a great CD."
4,Airborne Interception,"I discovered this book through reading Three Steps to Victory by Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the father of radar. Night Fighter gives a most interesting view of the development of radar to enable fighters to locate and attack enemy bombers at night or in heavy cloud. The tone is suprisingly humourous about a very deadly activity!"
2,K Hepburn,"I have met Katherine Hepburn!! I'll admit that I had never even heard of her until a co-worker wispered to me ""that's Katherine Hepburn. She comes in her every once in a while."" After that I watched her in Little Women. I didn't like it at all, I thought it was the boringest version I've ever seen but I probably don't appreciate it for the classic it is being only 17."
3,"The man is a player, not a teacher.","Flea is a great bass player. There's no denying that.However, most of this DVD is a discussion of his personal philosophy and Flea masking his conciet by transparently false modesty.I own this DVD and I do watch it, but I can't help but wince at most of his cliched ""advice.""That being said, watching him play is great, and there are some useful transcriptions in the booklet that accompanies the DVD, which will allow you to have a glimpse at what the guy is doing.Overall, this is a good DVD, but if you're a bassist looking for an instructional video, look elsewhere."
2,More philosophy than bass instruction,"This DVD is primarily Flea's philosophy on music, love, life, etc. I would consider it more inspirational than instructional. Definately belongs under the philosophy section and not the music instruction section. The few moments of instruction are fairly basic -- thumping, slapping, plucking. All right-hand technique. Flea admits that he can't read music, tabs, etc. So he doesn't really speak to any fretting technique. In fact, he sums up his entire left-hand technique as ""pressing his fingers down on the strings"". You might love this DVD if you're interested in Flea, the musician. You'll be disappointed if you're looking for some significant bass instruction. Instead, I would highly recommend Victor Wooten's Live at Bass Day 1998."
3,"Cool to watch, but don't get it as an instructional video","Luckily, I got this dvd after I was pretty good at playing bass. If they hadn't been the case, I would have been pretty mad. You get to see some cool jam sessions with Flea, and he gives some good musical philosophy with River Phoenix (right before he died) but there's a major problem with it: it won't teach you how to play bass.When Flea actually tries to be instructional, you'll see that he clearly is not a teacher. It does come with a cool tab booklet though, with good warm up exercises."
3,"IF YOUR LOOKING FOR INSTRUCTIONAL/ ""HOW TO"" PLAY BASS....DO NOT BUY!","Unfortunately, i did not read the review; i usually do! I was looking for an instructional DVD. However, i do not regret buying it. It's cool, with River Pheonix interviewing ect. It's really cool.I see that ""Lick Library"" has an instructional DVD on Flea and the Red Hot Chili Peppers Bass, so i think i'll buy that one.I hope that one will be instructional!!!(="
4,"Not what I expected, but well received!","I ordered this book, sight unseen, for a tractor pull fan. He really liked the book, so I'm happy. But I expected something different, and since there was no photo, I assumed it would be a coffee-table book; I was mostly going on the price. I guess it's a big pricey because it's from Great Britain? Still, the person I got the book for seemed very happy with it.By the way, the book is loaded with pictures with excellent captions!"
2,disappointing,"I wish they would have let him speak a bit more and edit the live performance more reasonably. The film is too ""artsy."" I just want the facts and some music, but that is not what is here. A shame."
5,The Sound of One of the P-Funk Originators,A great look at the man who helped construct the P-Funk Sound!!! Long live Bernie Worrell!!! Make my Funk the P-Funk I wanna get Funked up!!!
3,Poor Description - Works on No Longer Manufactured Camera,"I got this thinking that it would work on my E-620, but learned it didn't. While the description says it works on the E-1, they need to add which olympus cameras this unit won't work with."
5,"An incredibly humane, incisively written tale of redemption.","At first glance, the subject matter seems to lend itself to the stuff of melodrama: a young man, Sura, incarcerated in a juvenile detention center for stealing hood ornaments (""hoodies,"" as he calls them), is subjected to terrible degradation at the hands of its staff and his fellow ""juvies."" But where some lesser writers would manufacture a simplistic morality tale, Adam Rapp has constructed what is ultimately an incredibly humane, incisively written tale of redemption. In Sura, Rapp has created a truly unforgettable hero, whose distinctive voice propels this moving, absorbing story forward with remarkable humor and insight. I can't recommend this book highly enough"
1,book damaged.,I wrote a review of packaging and heard nothing. The book arrived damaged because it was put in a package that was too small. I heard nothing back. I am very disappointed.
2,Absolutely monotonous,"Watching a movie, I felt in love with one of the songs. I did some research and the song was Quelqu'un M'a Dit, from Cara Bruni's debut disc by the same name. I rush and bought it, and I was not a bit disappointed. Besides having great looks, Ms. Bruni has a beautiful voice, the guitar arrays were quite decent, and the melancholic tone was lovable.When I heard she had released a disk in English, I was eager to hear it... and as soon as I did I was terribly disappointed. This disk is absolutely monotonous. She basically took one guitar array, and adapted it to several different poems. The lyrics, yeah, they are nice... but they are not original. She still has that voice of a goddess, but I don't feel the disk is actually worth it."
4,Sturdy and attractive lamp but wattage only 150 watts,"This lamp is very nice with good features. The dimmer switch has a long cord and it is very easy to adjust with your foot, as intended. The base is heavy and the lamp is sturdy, plus it is easy to assemble. Although the lamp was advertised at 250 watts, the lamp and product sheet I received showed 150 watts. The manufacturer's distribution center advised there was an engineering design change in 2002 but they were not able to find one of the 250 watt lamps for an exchange. Note that I did not purchase this lamp here but it is the same lamp with the same item number. Even though the area where I intended to use this lamp needs more illumination than 150 watts, I like the lamp so much that I am keeping it and will use it in another room."
5,Outrageously funny! Waiting for the sequel.,"At first I was skeptical of Tom Arnold as an author, but after a few recommendations of ""How I Lost 5 Pounds in 6 Years"" my thoughts have changed.Tom Arnold's writing technique is wonderful and complements his humor and honesty. I found myself laughing hysterically and moved to tears with a turn of the page.I am glad I bought this book, now I have a new understanding and respect for Tom."
4,Great Book If You Enjoy Tom Arnold,"If you are already a fan of Tom Arnold than you will really love this book. Many of the stories are either very funny, very sad, or exactly how I felt in similar situations. I was disappointed in how the book ended, it seemed very rushed. With all of the profound stories sprinkled throughout, it kind of ends with a big blah... If you are not a fan, you probably won't be as into it as his fans are, but still an interesting read."
5,Hilarious...Simply Hilarious,"This book is so funny. When I read it, it was funny kind of like a purple bear that prances around on its bottom. Well, you know what I mean."
1,"2007's edition of HappyEnds was not happy at all: different fit, and stiff leather!","Last year, finally having found my perfect sand-color summer walking shoe, eroneously I thought, that I would be able to reorder the same sandle year after year. Just as one can do with Bass sandles. Not so! What a disappoinment!As I took the offendending, ill-fitting pair back to the store, I was reassured by the shop assistant that I was not alone in my gripes about this ""new and not improved"" edition of that sandle.I was given the 1-800 number to complain to the buyers. But do they listen??Wouldn't you think that such a large company as Easy Spirit would invest in quality control and make sure the shoes they sell are consistent in style and well made from year to year.My sister-in-law echoes my remarks on the same sandles, too. No happy end for these."
3,Spanish dvd for children,I was looking some dvds for my grand daughter in Spanish so i bought this one but i didn't find as good as i was expecting.
5,Good overview on the Hong Kong film industry!,"This documentary goes through the history of the Hong Kong Film industry back to it's beginnings with the opera houses. If you love martial art movies and if you are a movie buff, I would watch this, without question."
5,Martial Arts in the Movies,"The best moments from the greatest martial arts movies of all time. Take a trip through martial arts history, from its beginning in bloody rebellion to the high-fying action movies of today. Joing host Samuel L Jackson for the most action-packed moments from over 100 movies. Including rarely-seen vintage films and modern-day favorites. Highlights from these hit movies: Rush Hour 2, Charlie's Angels, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Interviews and footage of your favorite stars and directors: Ang Lee, John Woo, SAmmo Hung,etc. Special features: Digitally Mastered Audio, Six action-packed trailers of martial arts films, Audio: English and French-2 Channel (Dolby Surround), and Subtitles: English, French, Titles, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai."
3,Too Old For It Perhaps,"Perhaps I am too old to have enjoyed this book. But I read young adult and children's books often enough to know a good one when I come across one.Unfortunately, William Sleator disappoints with this one. The tagline on the cover explicitly states ""Now she's their toy..."" and I expected just that. The dolls are frightening enough, but there is huge potential (HUGE) with this story that Sleator merely avoids in order to keep the story within word-limit guidelines (I'm assuming).The twist as to how Vicki came to be inside the dollhouse is perfect, however, and caught me completely off guard. Otherwise, for a Sleator book (he has written some very good tales!), a very mediocre effort.My copy, published by Knopf, has illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman. My girlfriend introduced me to her work. She does an extraordinary job, drawing detailed and life-like works. It definitely brought the book to life."
3,Dolls get revenge...,"Vicky keeps dropping not-so-subtle hints that what she'd really like for her birthday is a new bike. When they get her an antique dollhouse instead, she can't hide her disappointment. At first, she avoids the gloomy, dusty dollhouse. Then, gradually, she starts to play with it.As her parents fight more and more, Vicky takes out her anger on the dolls. When Vicky suddenly finds herself a prisoner inside the dollhouse, she realizes that there is no way out--and she is at the mercy of the dolls.Creepy."
2,not worthy of this author,"This is a rather flimsy addition to this author's work, seemingly written solely to exploit the creepy aspect of dolls and dollhouses. The style is plodding, and there is no depth to the characters. Sylvia Cassedy's Behind the Attic Wall is far superior, and even Martin's The Meanest Doll in the World has more character development."
1,MOST HORRIBLE I HAVE EVER READ !!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!I have read over 1,000 books and this is by far the worst.I am eight years old.It gave me stress and this miserable feeling. There is a girl named Vicky and she gets a doll house for her birthday. She starts amusing herself by making the dolls fight. This includes slapping, beating, and injuring the children by the mother and aunt. The problems start apearing to Vicky when her mother and father start acting like it. But instead of thinking about the situation, she takes it all out on the dolls. Suddenly, she is in the doll house and I don't even want to think about what happens after that, but the dolls want revenge. Please, I am doing this for your sake and DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
2,Not his usual fine work,"I love the works of Ray Bradbury, ever since High school when we had to read Fahrenheit 451. I have enjoyed many of his stories, when I settled in with this one however, I found myself disapointed. Most of these stories were so unlike his well written classics.I found them lacking his usual talented works and became bored reading them. There were a few stories in here that I found all right, but I probably will never pick this book up again, only maybe to dust it off once in awhile and place with rest of my well read Bradbury collection."
2,Freshmen Effort For Sure,"I can't really say anything good about this CD except that later two great albums came from Bad Company with Brian Howe as lead vocalist. ""Dangerous Age"" and ""Holy Water."""
2,Bad Co.'s weakest album,"Hardly a disaster, but easily the weakest entry in the band's catalog, ""Fame And Fortune"" was a confused and convoluted comeback. There is nothing wrong with the new vocalist; he is fine. The performances by all concerned are good, when they can be made out underneith all of the sappy '80's synth-gloss. A few good songs do emerge and overall this is a decent, if somewhat forgettable and definitely unremarkable album. Not the place to start with Bad Company; for diehards and completists only."
5,Better than expected for price.,It came well packaged & arrived sooner than expected. It is very well made & works perfectly. I bought it for the tilt option which works for shading the deck at the end of the day. Love it!
2,"Decent umbrella, broken tilt","The quality of this umbrella itself seemed fine, but the button controlling the tilt was broken. Once pressed, it would not pop back into place, meaning the umbrella would no longer stay upright. We returned for a refund."
4,Market Umbrella,"Product arrived in pristine condition on time. Very nice, high quality product. However, I recommend buying the stand that goes with this umbrella; don't try to fit this umbrella in a stand you already have as it doesn't work. I'd buy from this seller again and recommend this seller."
2,Faded patio umbrella,"When I purchased this umbrella last summer I really liked it until halfway thru the summer the edges started fraying on 4 different edges. I notifed the company and they replaced it with no problem. Another thing I don't like about this umbrella is that it is very faded from last summer. The inside is nice and rich green and the outside is pale green! This will be the last summer for it but then I have the new one which I'll use next summer. Other than those 2 things, it works very well."
2,Not sturdy,This umbrella is not sturdy. When a breeze (light) comes up the umbrella moves at every joint and feals like it will fall apart at any moment. Do not expect it to last more than one season. I got what I paid for. Cheap.
4,Local Government is Excellent for Student and Politician!,"Local Government by Howard Elcock is a somewhat lengthy though insightful book into the inner workings of local and regional governments in the UK, as well as their unitary relationships with the central government. I personally used the book as a valuable source in comparing the local government structures of the United States, UK, and Germany with great success. This is excellent for the student of political science and public administration as Mr. Elcock gives clear and detailed examples of the reforms the UK has undertaken in the past 30 years, reforms the US are undergoing right now. This is also insight for politicians for similar reasons and because of the section devouted to the discussion of locally elected officials and their dispositions, roles, and mannerisms. Altogether this is an excellent source and a recommended reader for comparing local governments or for studying local government in general."
4,a forgotten gem,these guys could rock!strong vocals to say the least. ravens lead singer is a powerhouse.backed by a strong rhythm section and a fine lead guitarist. i cant understand how this group has been forgotten so completely.ive owned this album for almost 40 years and it still sounds current and fresh. if you ever played in a band when you were a kid man you wanted to sound like this!where ever these guys are thanks ya did good.
3,Sevylor 4 person boat,"Not quite for 4 adults, may be 2 adults and one child. A little flimsy but I guess for the price it's ok. A little low profile, if you sit on the side, water will come in."
5,Excellent Victorian sensibility - highly recommended,"What I liked about this book is that I really felt immersed in Victorian life as I read it, yet I didn't feel like the author was trying to ""tell"" me about Victorian life. She simply portrayed a character who lived that life and ""showed"" what it was like. I thought Charlotte a very interesting character with some unusual insights into life."
4,Attention all Book-Clubbers!,"This book is powerful, intelligent and ultimately leaves you hanging. It would be great for a book club."
4,This novel throws a curve & leaves you standing at the plate,A victorian novel with a surprising end (some may see it asunfullfilled). The novel starts out ordinary but suddenlybuilds into a series of events that trapped this reader.It was refreshing to see a woman evolve into personalfreedom. You can't help but sympathize with the heroineand understand her better. This is one character youwouldn't mind being friends with.
4,An Interesting Take,"The Great Philosopher's book on Hegel is interesting because it approaches him from a religious context. Normally one would expect a fifty page survey of Hegel to focus on the dialectic, his views on history or materialism or government. Instead, the book places its emphasis on his metaphysical philosophy. Different and intriguing, this book is well worth a read."
5,The Greatest Band on Earth,I have been a big fan of Rammstein for many years now. I was like a little child on Christmas morning when I recieved this dvd. Living in the U.S. it's hard to come buy the bands video's and such. This dvd has it all. If you are a Rammstein fan you know exactley what I mean. It is a very beautiful thing.
2,Can't find the menu,"This DVD is supposed to have several concert videos on it but I can't seem to find them. There is a small print notice on the inside cover stating that ""If your DVD player is too slow to read the menu...etc."" Then goes on to explain that I'm to press one button on my remote and use the numerical code and press twice.... I tried all day the first day I had it to find this mystical menu to no avail. The few videos that are on it that I can see are wonderful, but it isn't worth the money I paid for it without the rest of the material that's supposed to be on it."
5,The original Boy Gruppe does it again,"One of the best heavy Metal bands ever. These East German's have shown the world what true ""non-sellout"" rock is all about. Rammstein mix goth with techno and rock. This combination and the brash german language give it a wonderful sound and effect. The lyrcs are wicked and original. This dvd is a great buy and for the price, a great intoduction to any new R+ fans. Don't be shy just because you dont speak german. Many people love this music without understanding a bit of german. The DVD include subtitles in English, French, ect. Buy this DVD. One of the best bands ever!!!"
3,No 5.1,"I am a fan of Rammstein, Live Aus Berlin is about the greatest music DVD produced. Lichtspielhaus is nice, great songs and content as you would expect. But, I was dissapointed that 5.1 dolby digital is not active. 5.1 is listed in the menu, once you figure out how to find it. After selecting 5.1, a menu screen appears which indicates 5.1 is not available. That's too bad, Live Aus Berlin has one of the best 5.1 mixes I have heard. Lichtspielhaus should carry on the quality and entertainment level these guys are capable of. Can't beat the price though!"
5,A must have for any Rammstein fan...,"Intense and unforgettable, just like Rammstein. Du Riechst So Gut '98 is a disturbingly brilliant piece of work, and Mutter is positively unbelievable. The life footage is to die for, too. I absolutely recommend this DVD."
5,Essential to any fan,"This is one of the best produced music dvds you can find. A+ all around, and the best part is that it's dirt cheap! Rammstein is one of the very few worthy mainstream artists around. No one can touch them. It's about time that a band becomes big in America simply because they are good! And they don't even sing in English. They stand in stark contrast to all the nu metal feces that the mindless masses gobble without a thought, with their early 90's style Martial Industrial Metal shaded with Gothic melodrama. They're also one of the most visually stunning and theatrical bands since KISS. There may be hope yet."
4,Excellet Product. Just used at the wrong time.,"We ordered this program only two weeks before moving to Bogota, Columbia for a two year tour. However, the Spanish Rosetta Stone taught was much higher level than the survival Spanish we needed when we arrived. Overall we are learning the language and it is a GREAT program. Wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing."
1,Rosetta Stone,We are very unhappy with this purchase because we cannot down load it on to our computer due to the fact the product is too old. And the seller will not communicate with us! We are trying to return this and get a refund and are not have ing any luck! Can you help us?
5,Excellent !!!,"Seeing its forbidding price here I realize how lucky I was to pick up an Indonesian edition for just a few dollars...An extremely throughly written book dealing with all imaginable aspects of orangutan conservation, pulling no punches when pointing out mistakes made by conservationists so far.I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone seriously interested in the survival of these apes.If you have already read more popular books like Birute Galdikas' ""Reflections of Eden"" or Linda Spalding's ""A Dark Place in the Jungle"" and are left wishing for more balanced, serious information you could find nothing better than this one.Pity for the price!"
2,Very dated and 80s,"I love Lisa's voice, mostly heard during her time on Knots, so was excited about a release on CD, most of the songs are very of their time, nothing outstanding at all, a disappointment - that said it WAS the 80s so kinda expected that. Let's have the older stuff with more ballads released!!! She is better with ballads, her voice is lovely when heard on slower stuff. Hate being so negative but can't see me playing it a lot!"
5,The Best Out there!!,"This is the best product for cold sores and fever blisters. I've tried everything, even Abreva and nothing works like Banadyne. When I couldn't find it stores, I freak out until I did a search for it and found it here on Amazon, thank God. Your symptoms are gone by the next day, you can see and feel it working immediately. It works wonders if you use it with carmex lip balm. Best formula out there!!!"
5,It works,Use this when you first have a outbreak and it will stop it dead. Really works. Use to be in staores but I have been unable to find it so I went online.
5,Amazing stuff,"Don't waste your money on Abreva, this is way better. 2-3 days and cold sore is gone, before it ever breaks out."
3,Not sure if it worked,I bought this item after seeing all the good reviews. But I am not sure it really worked for me.I got cold sore inside my nose. It is difficult to apply the medication inside my nose. I stillhad a full blown outbreak after using it right from the start last month. But I will give itanother try next time.
3,Banadyne Review,Haven't used it yet so I don't know how to compare it with what I usually use - Abreva.
4,Great Raven,"Other ""hard core"" fans have panned this album as a sell-out, but I find it to have their strongest and catchiest song writing. Did they sell-out? You can't sell out if you don't make any money. I'd say it's their best. The bonus track ""Speed of The Reflex"" is a different side of Raven with flip-flop tempos and an ambitious arrangement."
4,No Turning Back is a great read,"A well-written, exciting, informative, and poignant tale of a young boy growing up in post-Apartheid South Africa. Young Sipho runs away from home to escape an abusive stepfather and lives on the street. Eventually taken in by a white family, Sipho learns he's only there to provide cheap labor to the father's business. Sipho runs away again. Great tale about love, forgiveness, friendship, and guilt."
5,On Tour - Yippie Skippie,"I loved this band in the 80's and found out they are playing in Cleveland this coming week. I will be there and can't wait. This time, though, Jay will be without Michael, as they have had some troubles over the years. Jay is the lead singer and it should be a great show."
3,It's OK-,"It's OK but I would not recommend it. The recipes are kind of dry. But, to each his own. Lauri's Low-Carb is pretty good."
1,Not everyday food,"I bought this book looking for every day type of easy low carb dishes. This is not the kind of food that I or my family can or would eat every day. There is alot of emphasis placed on German/Eastern European food. For instance there are six (6) bratwurst recipes, six kielbasa recipes,(3) red cabbage recipes, and other things that we just wouldn't make at the end of a day. I also think the book is in an unappealing format with the recipes appearing in a grid. There are no pictures. Its rather sterile. I let my daughter play with it. Sorry."
5,One of my favorites,One of my most-used cookbooks. Ingredients are easy to find and preparation is really easy. Excellent side dish recipes too. Pictures would make it even better.
1,Many better books on the market!,"I was very disappointed with this book. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Frances McCullough (Low Carb Cookbook-MMMM!) and Protein Power; these recipes were dull, heavy and not what I want to eat as every day fare. If you are not a fussy eater, and don't care about the gourmet touches and just want ""Fuel"", you'll probably like this book. If you want the niceties of eating, pass this one by."
5,"Excellent Recipes, lots of variety","I have quite a few low carb cookbooks and this is one of the best. There is alot of variety and recipes are easy to cook with items found in any grocery store. I especially like that the calories, fats, carbs, proteins, etc are broken out for each recipe. Some low carb cookbook only provide the carb values for their recipes."
5,No Exotic Ingredients,"I am not a cook but have really been using this cookbook. I started low carb about the middle of January and have cooked a new recipe almost every night. I found all the ingredients at our local Super Walmart. As with most cookbooks there are some recipes that did not appeal to me, but most of them have been great. I have never made soups before and I usually do not like them because they contain too much liquid. There are several of his soup recipes that taste so good I could just drink the broth. This has been one cookbook that has been worth the money."
1,"no pictures, lots of sugar substitute","Normally I don't buy cookbooks without photos since photos add a lot of information to a recipe. But I was looking for a low carb cookbook and this was on remainder. I was very surprised to find that ""sugar equivalent sweetener"" was called for in most of the recipes, even recipes like pork chops. I don't like the taste of fake sugar, so that made the recipes unappealing. Some of the recipes were trivial, such as Baked Chicken Thighs (only thighs and salt), and others were page fillers where the 'recipe' was ""Chocolate Ricotta Pudding"" - which simply told you to add chocolate to the Ricotta Pudding recipe."
5,Excellent,"Mr. Fishburne is an awesome actor and the powerful scenes suggest the reality that real good Black men exist. Even some, wh have blemishes on their lives."
5,A superb strength-of-character film,"Socrates Fortlow, imprisoned 17 years for murder, paroles to a depressed section of L.A. determined to harness the demon of his imprisonment: his anger. Despite being tempted and almost yielding to the demon, he manages to become a community asset. His strength, compassion and controlled rage encompass my favorite performance by Lawrence Fishburne. A must-see inspirational film exceptionally performed."
2,One of my favorite movies,"This film immediately became one of my favorite movies and sparked an interest in the work of Walter Mosely. I read the book and the book is excellent. I advise anyone to both read the book and see the movie. The main character, Socrates was easy for me to like and I was able to understand the struggle to make yourself better and to find dignity in daily life. See this movie!"
1,Not worth the time or money,"This film was an HBO film, so I figured it would be rather good. The movie starts out very slow and never fully explains the story which is the foundation for the movie. It does have some good ""smaller"" stories in the movie for younger children, but I would never show this movie to my children. It portrays the life of a black ex-con trying to make a living and make a diffeence in L.A. Although this may sound like an inspiring movie, it was not. The backlighting of the movie was very dim which made it hard to pay attention. If you like slow movies, then this one is for you. If you like movies that keep the interest level high, this movie is not for you."
5,Beginning of a great career,"For a first CD, this work is beyond expectations. I especially recommend tracks 6 and 9, ""Friends"" and ""Mirage"". These are my favorites. We listen to this is the office quite often. It's also a great CD to play in the background when having company over to visit. I'm looking forward to the next release."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. ALL NUDITY IS BLOCKED THEY EVEN BLEEP SOME OF THE CUSS WORDS. IT'S JUST STUPID [stuff] THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT ON TO THE SHOW, SOME OF IT'S FUNNY, BUT NOT WORTH BUYING. THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE REAL WORLD'S SO I KNOW IF THIS ONE [is bad] THE OTHERS MUST BE WORSE."
3,"Very entertaining, but too short","I enjoy watching the Real World Las Vegas on MTV, so I was looking forward to viewing this DVD.This DVD is very entertaining, and you can tell the cast gets along well. However, I was disappointed because the DVD is too short. The main DVD is less than 60 minutes long. There are a few extras that are short and not that entertaining.MTV records the cast 24/7 for several months, so you'd think there would be more footage to share on this DVD. Not so."
5,Spiritually Uplifting,This album touches the heart and satisfies the different musical preferences of all individuals. Well worth the price.
5,Fantastic,This CD is exhilarating and spiritually uplifting.It is a superb collection of music that suits different musical tastes and is well done. I can't stop playing it. I am going to purchase more copies to give to my friends
4,""" My Money Maker ""","When I was in my late teens I was in business with my Father in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A Stereo business. I used this CD to demonstrate my equipment and all that heard this recording (a cassette) asked me where to get it. Eventually a customer shop lifted it from me and that was the last I saw of it until I run across it on CD. Released in 1986 and is a striking example of Contemporary Jazz that doesn't have that same old sound that plauges most Contemporary Jazz bands. For it's time it had great bass response and would blow my customers away. After all it was so well liked it was stolen! How many reveiws can claim that! Klaus Doldinger's 1999 solo effort called ""Doldinger Back In New York"" has a great jazzed up version of the song ""Here Today"" renamed ""Here to Be"" It brought back so many fond memories of all the great people I had met in my time in Business."
3,Another death in middle age movie?,"Full of middle age flashbacks in an intergenerational interaction of a Latin Christian Scientist, her 60's Liberal daughter and the adopted child searching for her roots.Her roots are dying of cancer and was radio's "" Sleepy Time Gal"" disc-jocky.I really didn't like the movie, but the acting is pretty good, the story very humane."
4,Flexible and classy,"Nice, sturdy faucet. Taller than I expected (but I didn't measure) so it almost bumps into my soap dish on the wall. The pull-out spout is a little awkward, but helpful for getting toothpaste gunk off sides of sink. Would be perfect for washing hair in a large or deep sink. But in ""standard position"" you would never know it pulls out, just looks very classy. Only problem is the drain doesn't lay level when open, slightly tilted, but I think that might be installation error..."
5,The star of my bathroom!,"This faucet makes my whole bathroom look stylish and modern. I did a bathroom update by just changing the faucets and toilet. It looks great. The faucet works great too. There are no leaks, spray adjusts with two settings and the hose comes out and retracts - very cool. I did have a plumber over to install because I don't ""do it myself"" with home improvement. The price on Amazon was sooooooo much lower than anywhere else."
5,Going Back In Time,I bought this cd because I felt like reliving my younger years. The cd came quickly and it was in great shape.
3,Debbie Does Debbie,"Funny how time flies. It seemed only yesterday that Debbie was the reigning teen queen drawing cute faces on her exposed knee. Just the other day, I spotted her playing Katy Perry's mum. Oh dear, we are all a bunch of old hags.The first album of any artist normally makes the strongest and longest lasting impression. Out Of The Blue sees Debbie doing music that you'd put on when driving with your top down. You probably know her hits, so I won't go into that.But artists always want to ""grow up"" (musically at least) and please some critics. This is when their music cease to be fun and end up with diminished audiences. That was the case with Anything Is Possible which featured a switch to RnB.If you like cheery bubbly stuff and Debbie's best, go for this or her follow up Electric Youth."
5,a dream come true,"this album is a dream come true. debbie gibson is a talented singer, songwriter,and producer.some of my favorite songs are only in my dreams, out of the blue,shake your love,and foolish beat.i'm happy i have this album in my collction. ed wilson"
5,Debbie Gibson,Takes me back to the 80's! I still remember all the lyrics! I wanted to be Debbie Gibson! HAHAHA
2,Can't be taken seriously,"Yawn... what a bore! Could you imagine if anyone over 21 had recorded such an album? A sixteen year old girl singing lyrics like ""I could never love again, now that we're apart"" - who could take that seriously? Boppy, meaningless tunes, bubble gum pop at it's worst, with that voice, tinny and shrill, advising us all to ""play the field"" and making 'oh so bold' confessions, ""Shake your love, I just can't shake your love!"". But the most amusing of all is ""Staying Together"" in which Deb opens the song with a childish check-out-my-attitude speech, in which she's not ""asking you, she's telling you - they're staying together!"" Hey, it's cute, but that's ALL it is - Deb's age was her ONLY asset."
1,Singing with a spech impediment,"The 80s at its worst! This girl's voice was horrendous! At least Tiffany could sing without a speech impediment. Debbie: ""Jusshht a foolisshhh beat of my hahhhrtt."" Why sshhhhee's shhhuch a shhinging fool."
5,Debbie Gibson Rocks!,"I am a only a teenager and I've liked Debbie Gibon's music ever since I was 11. It was that year when I bought her cassette tape from a yard sale and I loved it! Her music is great and fun to listen to. Sadly, my brother ruined the tape, so I am so happy to find out that they sell the CD on amaxon.com! Debbie Gibson's music is really good, it's 80s pop and I love it! This CD is totally worth it."
5,A Must Watch,"I never considered myself a fan of Romance, but I watched Clannad / Clannad After Story because of its high ratings on review sites and I can safely say that it's certainly one of the best if not the best animes out there. While watching Clannad (Season 1) I was thinking about dropping the show after the first eight episodes, but I'm glad I didn't, because the show really got better. Like other reviewers, I sobbed quite a bit towards the end. I enjoyed After Story quite a bit more than the first season, but both are well worth watching. In fact, I actually watched both Clannad and Clannad: After Story online, and after enjoying them so much I went out and bought both on DvD here on Amazon to support the studio behind the series. =]. 5/5, a must watch. I'll end up watching it again because it's that good.Also - Definitely read the review by ""MedStudent"""
5,amazing and original,"this is not a review of the item but a review of the show. it starts off where clannad ends and only gets better, its got happy moments that make u smile and sad ones that could tear up grown men the episode White Darkness in particular but it picks up and eventually comes to a very good ending. i would wait for a blu-ray version but i jus cant wait so preordered this one idc if its not full HD its to good not to pick up right away!!!!!"
1,Beware of cdr copies being sold without even replicating the original booklet!,The album is great.However.... while it may seem that the price on this out-of-print title has finally dropped beware that the third party seller I dealt with sent me a cdr without even a replica of the original booklet. This may have been done by the record company as opposed to being a bootleg but it is the responsibility of both Amazon AND the seller to note that this is a cdr in the product description. I don't collect cheap cdrs so this goes straight back for a refund.
5,pure metal fun,Lets face it metal is fun and this one my friends takes the cake.This overkill album for me ranks up there with years of decay and horrorscope.The album has a nice fast pace that i loved to party with 15yrs ago and still today.To all the younger kids out there trust me this is a true classic that has stood the test of time and needs to be suported forever.
5,This CD must be reissued!,"Musically ""Taking Over"" was a big leap from ""Feel The Fire"", and is easily in the top tier of Overkill albums. Though sadly it wasn't the commercial breakthrough it should of been, and today is a lost and underappreciated classic of Thrash Metal. Being Overkill is a non-member of the Big Four of Thrash (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax), its quite common for such lesser known bands to have CD's out of print. But its a shame the ""Taking Over"" CD is not being made as of today, otherwise I and I'm sure others would be here to buy it. Somebody please bring it back!"
4,Electroviolence,"I love this album. The word ""Electroviolence"" best sums up the music on this album. Great songs and powerful riffs, ignore the 'What the critics say' review it maybe sub-thrash but it grabs you and shakes till the end."
4,Taking Over overkill,"I feel this is the best album with this Overkill line-up. Speedy songs, reasonably heavy. Some catchy and memorable songs. Bobby Blitz is one of my favorite metal singers along with D.D. Verni on bass. You can Feel the Fire with this one."
4,overkill is a good hard band with a unique sound i like,this album taking over to me is there best ever. its got alot of the older harder sound i like .
4,I love them...they are not like you and me!,"This was for my ex-daughter in law who died giving birth to twins girls. they are wonderful and have driven Grief from the door! They are so self=confident as they always have a confidant. you cannot correct one without the other charging in the room to make sure you do not get out of hand. Twins are beautiful,,they are great and fascinating to be with. Mine are now 4 -year granddaughters and despite their beautiful 7 year old sister they get the attention--yes it is unfair. The DVD helped my former daughter-in-law prepare and understand but unfortunately she did not oe to see the beauty she spawned. Good film but somwhat dated by recent research."
3,Sociology Class,"I'm a high school teacher. I bought this video to enhance the discussion of Nurture vs. Nature in my Sociology class. The students enjoyed the video, but they seemed to be a little bored at times. All-in-all, I would say that I'm glad that I purchased the DVD and I will continue to show it to my future classes."
4,"Superman, super book","Archives, Volume 1, showcases the first few issues of Superman (original series). The art has been recolored and lightly touched over; otherwise this is the closest you'll ever come to actually owning the original issues of Superman save for actually paying the money for them... Considering it would cost well over $100000 to get the original comics found in this book, it's a pretty darn good deal. Recommended reading for ANY Superman collector. Hardback, with color book cover. Siegel and Shuster's greatest gift to the world."
2,Contrived,"This is a vigorous performance of Bach's Cello Suites, but one that sounds rather exaggerated. The performer's use of dynamic accents and rubato are a bit extreme and often misplaced, detracting from the overall musical effect."
4,Mr,"works quite well if you are not looking for the flapper feature that keeps debris / dirt inside the storage area. In another word, you would want to empty it frequently."
5,Exactly what you need to make your Dust Buster work again.,"This is the exact replacement air filter (and bracket) for the older Dust Buster models (check listing to make sure your model is listed). If your Dust Buster is slow, loses it's charge quickly and doesn't seem to work right, it might be that the filter is clogged, like mine was. This seems to have fixed the problem."
1,Not as Advertised-,"I did not read reviews prior and received a 'single' (cheap) unbranded filter without the ""prefilter"" like the other 1-star reviews. Whats alarming is there are many 1-star negative reviews on this filter that date back months and it is still being sold.I sent an email to Amazon alerting the problem with the supplier's(T&T; Enterprise LLC) product -it's amazing how a $5.00 item can prompt a ""review"". Do not buy this item- look for the 3M version VF20 for about same money."
1,disappointed...not as advertised,"This product is advertised as a two piece system - plastic cover and filter - however, only the filter arrived. If it was meant to be the filter only, then the plastic cover should be removed from the imagery. I find this lack of clarity frustrating and a disappointment."
4,There are two product variations in this listing!,"I couldn't help notice a wide price disparity on this item. Amazon wanted $8 whereas other sellers were <$2! Since this is a consume-and-dispose type item, I decided to pay Buy-It-Now's exorbitant $6.95 shipping fee and buy 3 at $1.25 each - netting me 3 for $10.70 instead of $24 at the Amazon price.Here's what happened: I received the filters promptly but with NO packaging and NO plastic cover, JUST THE FILTERS. That's fine with me since as another review pointed out, the plastic cover is quite reusable with a quick rinse and it seems pointless to replace it every time ... and the packaging just goes to the landfill after all.BOTTOM LINE is I'm happy with my purchase but this should be cataloged as two different items - the ""Filter Set"" at a higher price for those who want the whole package, and the Filter ONLY for people who just want the filter a-la-carte. (I'll rate it 5 stars if they fix this... the filters are just fine.)"
1,Bait and switch!!! Should be 0 stars!!,"Horrible seller, rip off. We ordered the entire filter set which should have included the plastic cover and the filter. We did not receive the cover and the filter appears to be much smaller although it does fit. Amazon should ban this seller from using their site."
1,Inferior product and not like the picture,"I expected the 2-piece filter set shown in the picture. Instead I received 1 paper filter which has a much smaller surface area on it, and no cover. It would fit my DustBuster but would clog up that much sooner. I returned it and will keep looking."
2,Not as Described and Illustrated,"I did not get what is shown in your illustration of the product. The description under the illustration states that it is a ""Black & Decker VF20 Double Action (note that it says Double) Dustbuster Filter. WhaI recieved is the paper filter only and not the perforated plastic outer shell. Further more the paper filter is about 1/2 the width of the illustration and is not the same as the original VF20. However it does fit and I needed it so I am goig to use the 2 that I got. Next time I will look for another source."
1,Not the 2 piece black and decker item,I received only the filter portion of this item. This is not at all like the original black and decker part shown in the picture.
1,Does Not Come As A Set!,This is not a complete set. We only received the inner part of the filter. Will not buy from them again.
1,Item different than what is pictured. Much smaller filter surface area!,The replacement filter is different than what is pictured. It has a smaller surface area. The notches do match up so it fits in the vacuum just fine however my older partially clogged filter performs better than this one even though this one is brand new.
2,Wasn't a Set!,"Picture and descriptions indicate that these were to be a set. The filter, which was the correct item was shipped in a plastic bag. No box, no outside piece that completes the set. I have to keep the old used one, to use these filters at all. I feel it was misleadding and that I was shorted on my purchase. I'm not happy."
1,Wrong replacement filters,"I am not giving a one star review for the actual replacement VF20 filter but because it does not fit the new model CHV9610 (Shocking Pink color) Black & Decker 9.6V DustBuster. On the outside of the B&D box, it states: Replacement Filter #VF110 which I have ordered and will be returning this VF20 replacement filter for the older DustBuster model. Note: This filter was suggested as a plus sell item for this newer model CHV9610 DustBuster and the seller should correct the website to suggest the VF110 replacement filters."
2,Description was wrong,"The description for this item said it was the set, but the actual item received was only filters - not the set."
1,Bait & Switch,The supplier did not send the parts as shown in the advertisement. The parts are not boxed as shown. The parts are not manufactured by Black & Decker.
3,Black & Decker Dustbuster Filter,"Not as good as the original but it works. The filter medium is thinner and not as strong as the original, I'm sure it won't hold up as well as the original but I haven't been able to find any like the old one."
3,Dust Busted,"Shipping and handling were expensive, but overall it came out cheaper than any other option. The picture shows both the paper and the plastic filters. The order came with only the paper filter. Since I don't need another plastic one, I just accepted the order. Be aware, however, that the picture is misleading."
2,Mistake,"The item number matched what I needed, but the product did not fit my dust buster. What a disappointment that was."
3,As expected.,"These were shipped on time, packaged fine and fit as expected.Would buy filter again and would recommend to friends."
1,Not the item advertised.,"As with most others, I didn't get the two items pictured. I got a cheap knock off for the filter item only with no cover included. With less than 1/4 the filter area of the original I decided not to keep it as it would need cleaning 4 times more often and last only 1/4 as long. We'll test the return process and see how it goes. Amazon should know better.How hard is it to be an honest seller and post a photo of what you are actually selling?"
2,My scores are not lower.,"My scores are not lower due to this wisdom.My game has not really improved as a result of reading this book.That says it all, right?"
4,Complete recorded Works (1930 - 1938),"I purchased this CD for a friend, I had never herd of Oscar Woods, but after listening to the CD, I really like it and I wood recommend it to other friends."
1,Is this a joke?,"What exactly are we reviewing here! And what's with the ""Darn Good"" mockery of the earlier ""review""! The Beatles are copying Styx? You'll stick with their rivals...Roy Orbison! This must be candid camera! I tell you what, the fact that the imbecile who wrote the above gave this mysterious CD ""five stars"" is all I need to know about it!"
1,"Hmm, I guess I should have waited...","Being a huge Beatles fan, I bought this CD sight unseen. I guess I should have waited. I did not expect a CD of old interviews. Shame on me. I guess us die hard fans are always hoping for the next ""anthology"" and I thought this would be it. Oh well, learn from my mistake."
1,NEED MORE INFO,It would be helpful to see the list of the songs. Is this a re-release of the original or are there un-released versions of the original takes?
2,The oars SUCK!,I've used the raft twice. It's still afloat but the oars suck! I've broken both of them already. They're plastic threaded tubes that screw together. They need to be reinforced.
4,foreigners hay day,"this album has hits abound/inside information,say you will,and a couple of others that willbring out the rocker in you!!this album was released sometime in the 80s toward early 90s.if you like this group it's a great album to own!!"
2,"2.5 stars- A pretty mediocre effort, but still is better than the previous studio album","I haven't owned this cd since about 1988 because it's just not the Foreigner that I came to know and love in the years 1977 to 1981. The only song that I like to listen to repeatedly is the song ""Say You Will"". That song is what Foreigner should sound like. Everything else is boring and mediocre. Unless you're a diehard Foreigner fanatic, you should just pass by INSIDE INFORMATION and just stick with their first four studio albums."
2,Another bummer.,"""Inside Information"", is Foreigner's first album that couldn't crack the top 10, it only crawled up to #15. I really liked the lead off single ""Say You Will"", #6 and thought the album would be better than their last one ""Agent Provacateur"" for sure, NOT. It's just as bad. Only ""Heart Turns To Stone"", #7 mainstream rock was up to snuff. This really spelled the end of Foreigner for me."
2,Uninspired,If you can't get enough D'jango in spite of the fact he has over 50 LPs than you might well enjoy this uninspired clone.Oh there is one original ending. And some slight chord work that has merit.
3,eh...,"I was expecting the songs to be better, their old album is much more advanced. If you want to know if this is a good CD, i'l tell you that one of their songs sounds like blink 182."
4,Very informative and enlightning. Ralph holds alot of cards!,"This book was a very interesting read and and a minimum offers any reader a real ""View"" from Nashville, TN the World Capital for Country music and the stars and players involved.. I give it 4 stars and reccomend to all."
1,Dreary and boring,"As another book stated, ""He is arrogant"". I have never figured out how he got to be the so called endall of records in Nashville. Goes too show you, pickin's must be slim. In my book I will never forget the shoddy treatment of Gram Parsons (a real talent!) by this record spinner."
5,have read previous book,your first book was 2 thumbs up I will read your 2nd god bless you mr.emery since hee haw has gone and most of any old tm. music it is a pleasure to read about the real country from you some one who was there
3,good but not worth what it's being charged,"kicks, punches, knees and elbows.this dvd collection has some good content but it skims thruogh everything way too fast and is probably a bit too advanced for most people out there.honestly i think instructional dvds are a bit of a waste of money. nothing compares to joining a club and training with serious people.only buy if you are a fan."
1,Horrible perspective,"The authors of this text are very, very biased. They fail to see both sides of the argument and only do their best to paint one side as the 'bad' guys, while their way of thinking is superior. I had to buy this for a social work class, and am thoroughly disgusted that I have to read this and have it considered learning material."
1,Batteries are useless in kids toys,"I bought these batteries expecting to be able to reuse them in our newborns toys. To my surprise every kids toy we have requires 1.5 volt batteries and all of the batteries I received are 1.2 volts! Unfortunately I did not find out about this until I charged and started trying to use the batteries. For new parents especially; if you are buying rechargeable batteries, make sure that you verify the proper voltage."
1,Poorly Documented,"I found Drive Copy to be the fulfillment of the adage ""you get what you pay for."" After several attempts to get ALL of my data transferred I began to get error messages. When I consulted the online documentation I found that the error message I received was not listed. It is particularily distressing to have all the documentation online for a product like this because when you have problems you can't get online. You have to take the boot floppy out of the machine and reboot. Once you think you know what to do you must reboot from the floppy. If the problem isn't fixed you start the cycle over again.I ended up buying a copy of Norton Ghost 2000 and it worked perfectly the first time."
4,Revenge,This is really just a typical revenge movie with no real surprises but it's well done by Kevin Bacon.
3,Another Kevin Bacon film,"Just when you thought Kevin Bacon could not make another film, this comes along. Bit long and poor production values. If there was a moral to the film it escapes me. Just another stab, shoot and die film."
2,Not another revenge flick,"I was looking forward to this one ever since I saw the first trailer, but thought I would hold off until it was on DVD. I finally got around to watching it tonight and I'm really glad I didn't rush to see Death Sentence at the theater. Kevin Bacon does a decent job acting, but I didn't find any of the gang members believable at all. John Goodman was wasted and Aisha Tyler, as the cop ally, wasn't needed. The plot was the same old story it always is in these kinds of movies, so I won't say the story was razor thin. I knew that going in.The film was violent and gory, so I give it an extra star for not holding anything back, but this alone couldn't save a weak script.Check out The Brave One (not great, but much more depth than this one) or The Crow (visually stylish) if you want some quality payback flicks."
2,Run-on Sentence,"I think the film is a waste of good acting. It's all about revenge. And Kevin Bacon's character, Nick, deserves revenge because his son was brutally murdered. But there is gratuitous violence, a lack of basic logic, and a failure to build much interest in the key players.Nick is a corporate executive who somehow (never explained) is also a shockingly effective killing machine, adept at using car doors and seat belts as lethal weapons. He's a master of diverse firearms, although he needs manuals to figure out how they are assembled. He's pretty good with head slams too."
2,Death Sentence...,"The acting & action were good in this movie, but it was a bit too violent for my taste.This movie is all about revenge vigilante style, when a parent witnesses a brutal slaying of his eldest son and realizes the justice system may not give the appropriate retribution... So, he takes matters into his own hands."
3,"It's getting dark, too dark to see...","I must admit to being a bit of a sucker for these Death Wish type movies and this was no exception.Starts off with a reasonable, plausible situation then the bloodshed happens and off we go, with the distraught dad bent on revenge when the justice system fails.There are some good action scenes but overall there are more holes in the plot than in swiss chees, so do not expect too much. Bacon's character has some depth to it but there are a number of contradictions within the personality to deny this the nailbiting movie it could have been.and yes, there will be blood."
2,Bacon vs The Gang,"A completely silly movie. Bacon takes on a gang by himself after his son is murdered. The police are no where to be found throughout this film, ya right. A gang allowed to roam free without fear of arrest, ya right. Bacon allowed to roam free and kill gang members, ya right."
1,Laugh riot,"My wife and I were actually laughing near the end of this film. That a nerdy actuary-turned-Rambo commits such errors in judgement, manages to keep his day job, elude the most incompetent cops and fool his clueless wife (Kelly Preston) could almost be believable, but how he manages to leave his hospital bed with a gaping head wound, confess his sins to a dying comatose son in another hospital bed, jump out a hospital window, drive to the bank, withdraw his life savings, buy guns from a bloated, hapless gun pimp, go home and change, read gun owners manuals, drive a car into a van (splitting in half), find the thugs who just killed his wife, kills thugs, and manage to get home to watch home movies, well, you get the point. Should have gone straight to DVD, and to the bargain bins."
1,death sentence,"Moviemars has not responded - We can not play this blu ray in the US. We have had no respons from them. It is region B and we are region A. Can not be played.""0"" rating"
2,Unrealistic movie,"Half way through the movie, Kevin Bacon basically admits killing someone to a cop/detective and nothing happens to him... Although, up to this point, the movie had some insane action sequences, it started to become too much, as in too much caca. I haven't finished the movie but in 10 minutes (I'm at 1:10 min) it's become down right silly."
3,What`s unrated?,"I don`t know what the saying on the cover ""Unrated Edition"" means, because this was exactly the same movie that I saw, when I watched the German rental dvd. Unfortunately do have some movies the bad luck to get butchered up for their theatrical run in the States. The same happened to me once before when I saw the ""Unrated Director`s Cut"" of Clive Barker`s Lord of Illusion, which was again the same film I saw on rental DVD. So it would be nice if someone over there could look after the fact that some movies which are labeled the above mentioned way, get another certificat that indicates that this is the European Cut or whatever, because I`m sick and tired of purchasing movies that are not really great in the first place (and I`m not talking about the Barker film)and then they do not offer a single bit of improvement."
2,What starts off well....,"The movie starts of promising with a seemingly interesting story line but decends into a very trashy B-grade film ending. For all the excellent attempts of Bacon the 2nd half of the movie is totally unrealistic and most of all resembles an Arnold Swarzenegger movie when Bacon jumps out of his hospital bed after having been mortally wounded. He shaves his head, buys a bag of weapons from his targets father (!) and sets off on a wild chase where he manages to outshoot 5-6 hardcore criminals in their own crimeden!Shame it could have been so much better."
4,Very satisfied,I was very satisfied with my purchase. It was shipped very fast and I was very pleased.
2,Not as good as it could have been.,"Engrossing film. Hard to say if I actually LIKED it though. I wasn't sure I really bought Kevin Bacon as this mild suburban corporate Dad. The film certainly shows how bloodlust and revenge destroy this man and his family. Unfortunately, it also revels in the violence, which makes its message (if it has one) a little complicated. There is a really cool scene in the middle and there is a special feature on the disc that shows you how it was made. That was fun to watch."
3,"part movie,part music video","with all of the cliches.the walking in slow motion to a trendy song,picking bad guys from central casting....this wasnt completely derivative but how many ways can ''taking out revenge on those who killed someone i love'' plots be told?bacon gets a super sized dose of ''wrong place/wrong time'' while stopping for gas with his eldest son riding ''shotgun''.baddies enter,mayhem ensues,movie begins.the ''getting to know them'' beginning was a tad long but what follows makes up for it.lots of action and bad acting (sub par performance from an otherwise dependable bacon) and you have yet to look at your watch.if i had to pick a movie that doesnt require brain cells,this would be one of the better ones."
2,"Promises Much, delivers nearly nothing","Just saw this, and like other Wan films, the Saws included, found it predictable, lacking in what it promises, and in many ways simply a mediocre movie. Bacon is good, Goodman overacts, and everyone else is just pretty much there. The plot is something you've seen 1,000 times, and Wan in no way improves upon it. The transitions were poorly done, and the final sequence is almost laughable, it's so poorly over the top. The use of odd ""ballads"" in the soundtrack kinda underscores the fact that Wan is a totally unoriginal filmmaker, barring the plot (NOT the acting or film) of Saw 1. Don't even bother to rent it...OH, and BTW, this is one review area where the ""reviewers"" who give away certain key occurrences and the end are actually doing those who haven't seen it a favor."
3,A worst nightmare scenario for any parent,"A worst nightmare scenario for any parent.We've seen this type of vigilante revenge type movie before. Father's favoured son gets killed in front of him, and to get even and prove to his remaining son that he can make up for the death of his brother, goes on a bloody rampage.A watchable movie made good by a solid performance by Kevin Bacon."
2,Where are the cops?,"Completely unrealistic, this revenge fantasy depends on a belief suspension throughout. The most egregious absurdity is that the cops appear all but invisible while this gang war plays out. They are never around, though they have ample reason to be. Kevin Bacon looks like the lead singer of Slipknot by the time this is done, his head shaved and his face bloodied. Why isn't he arrested when the lead detective initially suspects him of killing the gang member who killed his son? Shooting galore here, and plenty of gore. No redeeming social value whatsoever."
3,not a bad movie,This was not a bad movie if you can get beyond the stereotyped bad guys and the obviously fake tattoos. Kevin Bacon is proving that his acting skills are good enough to make up for what would otherwise have been a direct-to-video motion picture.
1,An Embarrassment for Kevin Bacon and John Goodman,"Considering the source material, Brian Garfield's 1975 follow-up to his better known Death Wish, this should have been a decent film.It wasn't! Even the presence of Kevin Bacon, John Goodman (essentially a grotesque cameo) and in a much smaller role, Kelly Preston, cannot save it from director James Wan's ineptitude.There's very little logic to the movie, the production values are low rent, and it feels as if it was made some time ago and then finally released in 2007 rather than let the film stock turn into Fritos in a vault somewhere.A truly dreadful movie. Justice remains to be done to author Garfield's interesting and thought-provoking novel."
3,relatively ordinary saw,"While the saw cuts materials smoothly and quickly, that is what it's supposed to do, right? Nothing special. The bevel adjustment system is about the same as you'd expect to find in a $29 saw, except this one is better quality. Only complaint is the little plastic blade guide that keeps falling out."
5,Incredible read!,"As a therapist, I read this book as a means for any survivor of a trauma to have hope for healing. I believe it will give some the determination to find that one person in their lives that will believe their story and lead them out of their darkness. The reader will either question or embrace their beliefs in a higher power, and realize they were never alone in their darkness. When led out of a trauma, the internal peace that comes with unexpected unconditional love, and forgiveness is truly within ones reach since this book was based on actual events. It will especially help those who have endured a repressed trauma... they will no longer have to question if their story ever happened."
2,Informative but opinionated,"The beginning of this book is great for those who love to read about how Disneyland developed, costs and ideas. However the rest of the book is full of ""facts"" that mean something to the writer but really don't mean much to the Disneyland fanatic, like I am. You would have to live in a bubble to not think that accidents happen, employees play pranks on guests and co-workers etc. Nothing in this book really shocked me or made me question my love for the Happiest Place on Earth."
4,Good for the very curious,"I got this book out of curiousity (and some reviews). It's really supposed to be shocking, but it really isn't. The only real shocking part is concerning the countless park fatalities. Shocking because death is really not supposed to occur in a world of fantasy. Since I've been to Walt Disney World countless times and never visited the ""real"" theme park out in SolCal, I would say it's pretty much for those just DIScovering Disney. I also enjoyed the chapter about the walk-around characters. Since I hound around Disney World looking for them, I have to give them major props for the junk they must face in their job."
4,Disneyland Facts,"Great fun for those of us who can't get enough of the Magic Kingdom and like learning all the gritty details (some people may not) of what it takes to keep the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" running. I never think about the reality of the ""business"" of Disneyland while I'm there having fun."
3,"Interesting subject, poor writing style","I enjoyed the book, but I found myself re-reading a lot of lines trying to understand the sentence. Some of the anecdotes were interesting but put together in a way that reminded me of the girl in American Pie telling a story. ""One time... In Band Camp"". Also, I have never seen a book with so many sentences starting with ""and"" or ""but"".Other than the writing style, I actually enjoyed the book."
1,I just returned this book to Amazon.com,"This, without a doubt, is the dumbest, most stupid, idiotic book that I have ever read/tried to read. It is awkwardly written in a nonsensical manner. It includes many, too many, idiotic, PROBABLY NOT-TRUE, stupid accounts of practical jokes that DL castmembers play on each other. Honestly, who gives a hoot. I thought it would give me behind-the-scenes looks at attractions, and other things. It is such a pathetic attempt at humor, I returned it tonight. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GETTING/READING THIS UPBSURD PIECE OF TRASH. It's just not interesting, and plain moronic to me."
2,"Interesting, but...","This book has some fun and interesting stories. However, it is written on a 3rd grade level and reads more like a Dick and Jane book than something for people who can under stand monosyllabic words."
5,the very best,David's work is amazing and I really enjoy it and could notbeleive what a wonderful item this really is(...)
2,book was somewhat interesting but too negative,The author took a very negative approach to reviewing Disney. A bit like the National Enquirer.
4,It was interesting,"I bought this book and a couple others on Disneyland. I just got hired to work at Disneyland, so I wanted to read what it was like to work there. I was very excited to work there, until I read this book. It made me feel a little weird. It tells lot's of stuff you never hear about, or even think about, that happen at Disneyland. I wish he told more recent stuff, most of the things were before I was even born. I am 26. It was a little depressing, I can't think of another word, but I also found it interesting and kept reading and reading. If you don't mind having your image of Disneyland change, you should buy it."
3,Sneaky? Disney???,"Without a doubt, Koenig's Mouse Tales is a great read with plenty of things to keep you entertained and make you think. The only problem with this page-turner is that it is unofficial... and I suppose that to uncover as many ""secrets"" as he did, it has to be that way... I would definetly reccomend this book to anyone who is in the search of the truth about anything and everything commercial... but if you are a devoted Disney fan and lover... stay away from this eye-opening book!"
4,Very funny light read,"I had a lot of fun reading this book. You have to take it for what it is and know that it is just some fun info on some behind the scene antics of the cast members. Also other facts but I would say that many of those I already knew so it was the other parts that kept me laughing.If you love Disney like I do and would like some fun summer light reading , then pick up this book."
5,Great for anyone who's more than a casual tourist!,"I'll admit that I'm a Disneyland fan, and I purchased this book to learn more about the behind-the-scenes world of the theme park.I wasn't disappointed. Koenig presents varying looks at all aspects of the park, from the original planning and design, to disgruntled staff members, to tales of ""stupid guest tricks"".This book is an amusing read for anyone who has ever been to the park, as it shines light into areas not often discussed. Various topics from the book can be great conversation pieces, and after reading the book I guarantee you that on your next trip to Disneyland you'll be looking at things differently."
2,Been there done that.,"Working for the mouse for 7 years now I thought I'd find something new in this book for me. It was all stuff I already knew. It was poorly written and several of the stories are repeated in the book. For someone who has never worked for the mouse they I'm sure will find this entertaining. But looking at it without 'leaving your brain at the gate' its stuff anyone does at any job.I'm proud to work for this company, I just wish outsiders realized we are humans we do make mistakes, and by gosh we work our HARDEST for minimum wage to make your vacation the best it is. And when we get a thank you from you, thats all we really need to keep us coming back the next day."
3,"Nice read, but a little dated","Seems like there are plenty of folks who are the hardest of hardcore Disney fans. I always considered myself one as well. BUT, this book had a little bias to it, and that isn't as much a criticism as it is an observation. This was especially clear in the labor relations sections of the book. Like many others, I felt that reading this book was fun and rather addictive. It is a simple book easy to read in a sitting or two. The style is more like listening to a loyal employee trying to be objective. The book attempts to be the insight and behind the scenes story of a company well managed and ever cautious of it's public image. What the reader must acknowledge is that it isn't that easy. Not as balanced as I would like, but the info is fun and informative. Reasonably priced too!"
4,Give it a break!,"This is an interesting book, and besides a few skips here and there is extrememely fast reading. I read this book in one sitting believe it or not. All the other reviews have said things like it tainting your vision of Disney, and all the horrors going on, etc. Come on people, it is after all, an amusement park in the real world. Of course things will happen and of course the park will not want everyone to know about them. This book has some interesting facts in it, but overall was surprised at the wealth of knowledge that WAS NOT in the book. It could've been much better, but was fun just the same."
4,Issues at Disney,"If you thought that Disneyland was the best place to work, think again. Disney is not immune to problems, and this book tells all about them. Koenig takes an un-edited, behind the scenes look at Disney. Read about how Disneyland has changed since Disney's death. Or what really goes on with those people who wear the larger then life Mickey and Minnie Mouse suits. What you don't know won't hurt you. So if you want to go to Disneyland thinking that it IS the 'Happiest Place on Earth,' then you may not want to read this book."
4,All the bitter truth... makes the nice parts even sweeter,"First, and very important: there's nothing in this book that you can't find already on the Net. But here you'll find a really objective account of the Disneyland's backstage story - something which is quite difficult to see in a world that seems factionally divided into Disney worshippers and bashers.Also to note: this volume is mostly about the crazy antics going on behind the scenes. The sequel is more oriented toward showing the black underbelly of the park's management."
1,Disappointed,The information contained in this book may be useful it is difficult to get to. The book is very large making it difficult to comfortably hold while reading. The font is extremely small making it very difficult to read. It is poorly formatted and does not flow well while trying to read. I would not buy this again.
1,Love the book but...,"It's missing about 30 pages (064-097). And those pages have information that my son was interested in. Other than that, the book is crammed full of practical info of about anything you can imagine."
4,Had to buy it after checking it out from my library,"I found this book indispensable. After checking it out at the library and enjoying all the good advice, from chickens to herbs to crafts, I just had to purchase a copy for myself. Definitely a keeper for your own library."
4,This book is a collection of most of the small Storey Bulletin Pamplets - all in one place.,"Good information, but I too was frustrated by the small print, so I used a magnifying glass. Loved the sections on raising chickens and canning food, my husband uses the section on gardening.Persons interested in this book would also probably like the ""Foxfire"" series of books, which I highly recommend. That project collected the how-to information and personal recollections of many persons who lived in the mountains during the early part of last century. It gives you information on how to build what you need but can't buy if you are living in an isolated area (some of the Information on everything from Apple Pie to How to build a violin; and the stories and recollections of people who lived in those times are priceless, as the new generations don't have the know-how. Some of the Foxfire series is available on Amazon, or at you local library."
5,Country Wisdom,"Really love this book. Has tons of how to's in every page. It can help you do most anything you would like to do to be independent as much as you like. You name it, it is in the book. Bought for a Christma present. Was constantly thanked for this item."
5,Everyone should have this book!,Everyone should have this book!All of the information in this book is knowledge one needs to survive off the land.
5,The Best 20 bucks I've Spent!,This book is not only full of useful information; it is also helping to preserve country wisdom. If you are interested in more sustainable existence or just interested I the simpler side of life - this book is a must have. I have used it countless times and have given it as a gift.
3,Country wisdon and know how,"This is generally a good book for people wanting to know how to live off the land. I agree with the review I had read before I purchased the book that the print was small and hard to read. There's alot of good and interesting information in the book, but the print size is a draw-back."
3,Toxic advice!,"Just bought the book and seems to contain allot of useful information. One thing I did note in the animal section is the part about alternative treats for dogs on page 55. The book advises to feed seedless grapes as a low calorie snack. This is dangerous information in that grapes are toxic to dogs and can cause renal (kidney) failure. It does not happen in all cases and the mechanism of action for the kidney failure is not known at this time. Being a veterinarian and dealing with theses cases in the past, it can be not only a life threatening condition, but also a very expensive one. I have informed the publisher, but it should be public knowledge as well."
3,"Good Content, Bad Packaging","I am sure that the information in this book is excellent, as I have read other Storey guides before and found them very helpful. However, when the other reviewers comment on the size of the font and the quality of the paper, they have a very legitimate complaint. The font is miniscule, and the paper is thin and flimsy. Also, the large size of the book makes it difficult to pick up and flip through. As someone interested in the aesthetics of a book as well as the content, I would have to say this is a very poor design. I would rather pay more and get a book I could read more easily."
3,"Good Book, Small Print",I agree with a lot of the reviewers that the print is small. But this book is packed with tons of info about country living. After having lived in the city for years we now live in the country and have found a lot of helpful hints. It's divided quite well and particular topics are easy to locate.
4,"Tons of information, but layout is a little awkward","There is an insane amount of valuable information in this book, the only reason I'm giving 4 and not 5 stars is that I think the layout could be better (this is a gigantic book made out of recycled paper with a softcover, which makes it very floppy). Otherwise this is a great thing to have in the house, although I'd suggest gettingWhen Technology Fails: A Manual for Self-Reliance and Planetary Survivalas well."
4,Whole Earth Catalog for the 21st century,"A book for the 21st century in the spirit of the Whole Earth Catalog. Big and thorough, it goes into detail upon detail of the stuff you aunt or uncle would have told you if they lived in the country.While they don't tell you where to buy stuff (WEC did), it does tell you what to look for when you buy, so maybe a better deal?My only complaint is that the type is so small I've had to order a magnifier to read it."
2,Country Wisdom & Know-How,Honestly I am not sure if this is what I thought I was purchasing. Sometimes when you are reading the description it can get confusing as often times other books are being advertised. So I may have thought I was ordering somthing similar?? It's not a bad book...just not really what I thought I was ordering.
2,Not Applicable to Organic Farming,"I bought this book from a local bookstore with hopes that I would have a great offline resource for our future farming efforts. Turns out that this book may be really helpful for someone hoping to do conventional farming where you use toxic herbicides and fertilizers, or where you feed your animals GMO grains (any grains with soy are GMO).Ultimately, I didn't get much out of it. I LOVED the cover design and the general style of the book, but its recommended approaches just aren't for me.Disappointed."
4,Great Book,"I primarily got this for my girlfriend as she's a total city girl and I'm originally a country boy growing up with much of what this book contains already. After 11 years she is starting to ask questions about the things I do and is intrigued to learn. I try to teach her when we get time but between our work schedules and out of work activities, teaching doesn't happen as often as I would like. So I decided to buy this to have around for her to reference. After thumbing through it I came across so many things that my parents and grandparents did, some of which I still do. I think that this is going to be a great supplemental tool for her to use in order to help her to be more self-reliant.Now the funny part about this book. It's frigging huge! By huge I don't mean thick because it's only about 1 1/2 inches thick. I mean it's 13 inches tall by 10 inches wide. But that's okay because this book is pretty cool."
3,"Allot of great info, but the writing is too small","Great infromation, but the font they use is way too small. I gave one as a gift, the guy loved it. I love mine, it's highlighted, notes are written in it, and it is dog eared. The only thing I can say neg is that the font is way too small, now don't get me wrong I understand why they did it, there is soooo much info in the book. The book is big now, it would be huge if the font was bigger."
3,Country Wisdom,"Good book w/ lots of good info. However, it's hard to read b/c the fonts are to small. I have good eyes but have to use a magnafying glass it I try to read it to long."
4,Great Book,Excellent source of knowledge for anyone who lives in the country. Loads of information. Only con is that the print is very small.
4,Country Wisdom and Kinow-How,"I've heard from others that the print is very small. They weren't kidding! The print is readable, but sort of a pain the bum to keep reading after a few pages.Oh, and be careful with the pages, they're like phonebook paper- very thin and very ripablePrinting,etc. issues aside, The wisdom itself is great! I actually used the tips mentioned when we had a week-long power outage. If you're a city-slicker(like me) then you're going to need this once you get out into the boonies, lol. It covers everything I could think of and then some.As I continue my quest to live the country lifestyle, I find myself turning to this book more and more."
4,I am still squinting,"I love this book. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is the print is so darn small. This book has everything! Animals from feeding to butchering. Gardens from soil to preserving. Constructing out buldings, making wine and everything you can imagine in between. Since this book has arrived it has become a reference guide for various activities around our home. Perhaps the small print is logical, there is so much information contained in this book larger print would require three volumes."
5,A book to live off the land.,"I told my wife that if the world was coming to and end to grab what she could for food and clothes and I would grab, my rifle fishing pole, axe and this book. It is packed full with everything you need to know to live off the land."
5,Outdoorsman resource,"Terrific info for anybody who camps, hikes, or just wants to know the basics of living with fewer modern conveniences.We bought them for our sons for Christmas and they never got around to opening any other gifts!"
3,Not as informative as it could be,"This book has a lot of good information. Unfortunately, there's garbage mixed in. It is to be a guide to help you live off the land. However, as an example, the section on rabbits merely talks about pets and show bunnies. It does show how to build cages, etc, but never once mentions that rabbits are edible. If they aren't, why are they in a book about living off the land? There's better books out there...my copy is going to be donated."
3,You can do better,"This book is ok - hence the 3 stars. I think a better purchase by far is Carla Emery's book. This book is as large as an atlas, very bulky, and hard to use - in a practical way. Skip it and get a smaller, more manageable book with better information."
2,Not recommended,"Don't expect to hear any type of studio or live recordings near the Hensley/Lawton UH period in the late 70's.For superior live recording with Lawton/Hensley, pickup UH's Live in Europe 1979Lawton has lost his voice and the band gives a sluggish performance.This recording has been in plenty of the used cd shops where I live, so I am not the only who was disappointed.Feel free to click, ""NO"" for those who disagree with this. I am just trying to save other people some money that could be spent elsewhere at Amazon.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
5,Airborne all the way!,"Mr Carter wrote a fasinating,timeless,and motivating story of the men whom fought for this great nation as paratroopers, and the esprit de corps which binds them. An unassuming and moving narrative,as seen through the eyes and mind of an airborne infantry soldier. I read this book the first time as a seventh grader, and took the decision to become a paratrooper. Graduated jump school June 1972. Went on to become ranger qualified. Served 30 months on jump status. Motivation. I still think of Mr.Carter and his fellow paratroopers to this day. Hooah, Geronimo!!"
5,Excellent.,"Pleased with the purchase. So much important information about the many identities of 'God"" conveyed in simple and easy-to-understand language. Good book to start with on this essential faith topic."
3,Pretty good book,"OK book - lots of personal stories, etc from the author related to the names of God. Wanted more bible related info on the names of God"
5,Good book for Bible research,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and after purchasing it, I understood why. The book is very helpful. It contains a great deal of information in an easily accessible format."
1,Think twice before buying this,I can't believe I just paid $5.95 for this 650-word article. I could have written this myself in 10 minutes! What a rip-off!
4,"too early for a ""greatest hits"", yet never too late.","Terri Clark is one of the best modern country artists out today. It's great to see some of her ""hits"" on this record, as well as all the other gems from her previous albums on this one fine record.Great work, but I believe this is a corporate decision for her to release a greatest hits cd just to make some money. Terri has a whole lifetime ahead of her with regard to her music. I could see her releasing a Greatest Hits in 10 years from now, but it's too early with the 4 or 5 albums that she's released over the years.This album should be essential for any Terri Clark fan, or a casual Terri Clark listener."
5,terri clark fan,this is a great cd i like her upbeat songs like girls lie too or i wanna do it all great cd defintley a good christmas gift for terri clark fans
4,"REISSUE! Intense, good book","This book is a good, intense book. If Lavyrl Spencer is a favorite author and you did not read this when it was first issued years age, you will want to pick it up. As usual, she treats emotions with depth and the book maintains a pace. Plenty of tensions and you wonder how Spencer will resolve the situation. If you get irritated with publishers for repackaging old books, especially when you realize you have already read it, remember this is a reissue."
2,"Not at all ""Fulfilling""...","I unfortunately picked up this book at a local used book store and it was a waste of 75 cents. Don't get me wrong: I love and absolutely adore LaVryle Spencer and her work (i.e. Hummingbird, Vows, Twice Loved). But what was she thinking??***Because I received a few hateful emails and comments from those who object to my posting of my personal synopsis of the book, I have removed the rest of my comment. Some people can't read a book for themselves and form their own opinions. And that's very sad.***"
3,Another good read,"I have read every book Lavyrle, she is one of my favorite authors. I wish she would start writing again."
5,Excellent reading.,Lavyrle Spencer again tells an interesting unique story. The plot is original. The characters are iintereresting and likable. This is one of the better romance novels that I have read. I plan to keep it to read again.
5,Great game for all ages.,"I bought this game for my sister as a Christmas present but I, of course, had to test it out. I tested it for an estimated total of 20+ hours, not all at once of course.It's a really fun game that is very simple in concept and game play but a challenge every time. If you are considering buying this game, just do it."
4,A must read for surfing historians.,"Almost everything you wanted to know about the Duke. The father of surfing, Olympian, and the definition of aloha spirit, this book tells the whole story. Only criticism is there are not enough photos of this incredible man.This should be required reading for young surfers."
4,Stupid Admiral Tricks,"A must read for everyone who wants to know how to prevent mistakes. Hickam details the consequences of the American failure to protect properly the critical atlantic coast sea lanes. Poorly equiped, improperly used, vessels were overmatched by experienced German U-boat crews. Only the interention by Roosevelt in the day to day operations of the US Navy and Hitler's refusal to commit adequate resources to ""Operation Drumbeat,"" kept the German's from crippling the US war effort."
5,Awesome Book!,"This is a great, page-turning history (It's always a thrill find one of these) of little-known U-boat engagements against merchant shipping off the Atlantic coast at the beginning of WWII.Nearing the 3/4 point in Mr. Hickam's book, I took last night off to view the film, ""Das Boot,"" a well-researched German-produced film about a WWII U-boat and crew. Don't get me wrong. The book is incredible, but if you want to spice up the experience even more, ""Torpedo Junction"" and ""Das Boot"" (The Boat) make excellent symbiotic entertainment."
3,A WW2 HISTORY LESSON THAT FEW KNOW,"I KNOW NOW FOR SURE THAT I WOULD NEVER WANT TO BE A MILITARY OR MERCHANT SAILOR OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST IN 1942. TORPEDO JUNCTION WAS EXTREMELY WELL DOCCUMENTED AND RESEARCHED, BUT ALSO DESCRIPIBED BY SURVIVORS FROM U-BOATS, NAVY AND COASTGUARD SHIPS AS WELL AS MERCHANTMARINES. MY LOWER RATEING COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE U S WAS ALMOST HELPLESS AGAINST THE STEALTHY GERMAN U-BOATS, AND THAT THE DATA WAS HARD TO STOMACH (I'M NOT A BEAN COUNTER). THE MOST VALUE I SEE HERE IS SOME BASIS FOR HICKAM'S LATER BOOKS, ESPECIALLY ""THE KEEPER'S SON""."
1,"Poor quality, poor support","Purchased this in April 2007 and it broke down in June 2008. The picture is fuzzy and shaking all over. When I called Support, answer was ""We have no troubleshooting tips, you are out of warranty, look in yellow pages and get it fixed. No service centers as well"". Even their toll-free support has been discontinued. Are they wrapping up? I was stupid enough to think I do not need extended warranty for a $600 TV.Now, about when it was working - compared to picture on some of the latest HDTV (I have Samsung and Panasonic), it was only average. Integrated DVD is convenient for sure.I regret having purchased this TV."
1,"AKAI 32"" LCD with DVD","Sorry, while the LCD provided fine picture quality, the DVD soon began rejecting DVDs until it finally refused to play any DVD (within 30 days, both old and new DVDs). Upon return, I learned that this particular model has a nasty history of returns for various reasons. Cannot recommend, and in fact discourage anyone from buying this one."
1,I would give it a 0 out of 5 stars if i could (buy a Vizio instead),"Bought this TV about 6 months ago and was bad from the get go. First off, the TV quality was horrible. Then around 3 months later I started getting a line down the right side of the screen. Because of that I decided to call Akai's customer service (which is not toll free). They told me that i could return it but i wouldn't get a full refund. So because of that I am stuck with this crappy so called ""HD""TV. Stay FAR away from this item, go buy a VIZIO instead."
1,Akai LCT3201AD stinks,I do not want to spend a lot of time writing this because the other negative reviews you have probably already read are accurate. I have 2 of these TV's. Good prices but cheap quality. The sound sucks on both TV's and the DVD player is out on the newer one. Spend your money elsewhere.
1,HORRIBLE,"We bought this Akai from Sams Club and within a month the dvd player broke and our dvd got stuck in it. We figured it was because this one was a return, the rep said there was nothing wrong with it, so we gave the benefit of the doubt. We exchanged it for another Akai - same model - and within 2 months the screen went blank and the tv turned itself off. When we turned it on again it would only go on for half a second then go blank again. Thank God for Sams Club where returning/exchanging is easy. We brought it back and this time got a Magnavox. Akai - not worth a penny, absolutely not worth the aggravation."
1,Poor Quality,We purchased this TV almost 3 yrs. ago and use it in our master bedroom so it is on only a few hours each day. The sound quality has never been good. A day ago the remote would not turn the set on without multiple tries. The red light would turn green then back to red. Then it quit working so we used the power button on the set. Now that won't work. Unplugging the main power cord works once to at least turn it on. I have been researching the problem online and have found that there are hundreds of customers with the same or similar problems with this set and other Akai TVs. I will not buy their products in the future and will think twice about Samsung also since they are the ones who also produce Akai.
