5,Christmas gift,I chose this for my grandson who is a big fan of Joe. He and his father go to many of the concerts and this was one that he did not have. He got it for Christmas and was thrilled with it.
1,Artist Should Change His Tune!,"Bonamssa's got tone and talent, but he's not playing anything we haven't heard for decades from hundreds of talented player/singers.He should have graduated from garage band guru to pro long ago. Good blue collar tunes for his blue collar following, though.The artist seems to be struggling to find a path back to where he was when he released earlier efforts like A New Day Yesterday and So It's Like That. He's gone from writing nearly all his own music to nearly always covering past Classic Rock and obscure blues tunes, thus resonating with a crowd of older, lower and middle class fans. Much of this particular work is background music for the Pepsi Generation from the 70's.As a copy cat lick player, he's astonishing. As a creative force who's inventing new sounds and techniques, not so much.As a critic of musical copy cats once said,""It's one thing to do your homework and another to actually graduate."""
2,Even More Confused,"No doubt that Joe has talent, but why he did not take this ""idea in his head"" as a solo project, and not dispose of his previous band, i think in the end will only polarize more of his die hard fans. This studio effort was interesting for sure, but is it a ""Blues Deluxe"" effort. This one is going more difficult to pull off on the road. Bonamassa is still young enough to become a giant on his own. But for now, there is a sense of lost direction. Wishing him well, but im afraid he changed his horses in the middle of the stream too soon."
2,Not that Good,"Sorry, But this CD is no where near as good as his previous one's. I would have thought that with the producer he had on this one, it would be a lot better, it's just missing something. For new fans of Joe's skip this one!."
2,Hardcore Bonamassa fan left disapointed,"I own all Bonamassa albums and DVDs and have seen him live 4 times. I know what he can do, and this album does not capture it. The album lacks a good all around vibe, the music is cliche and boring...Bonamassa is such an incredible talent and guitar virtuoso, I know he can do better. ""Helicopters,Palm Trees, and Gasoline"" could have been longer. ""Django"" could have been more about jazz ideas. Bonamassa could have taken his solos to new and exciting melodic heights like he did in Bloodline, but he choses to play in the box. With this album he had the oppurtunity to take blues to a new exciting place, and this album doesn't accomplish that. If you wanna hear this guy at his best check out the band Bloodline or his New Day Yesterday, So Its Like That, Blues Deluxe or live albums."
4,Death penalty injustice,"Injustice in criminal cases is a passion of mine. Bad cops, judges and prosecutors have too much power over a person's life. I've seen so many people wrongfully accused. I am in favor of the death penalty if the person is guilty beyond any doubt. Otherwise, life in prison is the only answer. Evidence can be presented any way the prosecutor wants and that needs to change now."
3,Previous Reviewer's Serious Error,"Joshua Marquis' review contains a serious error. Former Illinois Governor Ryan did not ""free"" 150 men on death row. He commuted their sentences to life in prison after researchers had found evidence that did free two (I think) men who were on death row.Those on Illinois' death row who were actual murderers remain imprisoned for life.I have not read the book, so this review is not intended to either endorse nor condemn the book. I do, however, condemn reviewers who blatantly falsify the facts."
1,Not a journalist,"Posing as a journalist Bill Kurtis has now shown that he has a very definite agenda, that being to abolish capital punishment, and not be persuading anyone that it is wrong for the state to kill, but repeating the half-truths and outright distortion of disgraced and indicted former Gov. George Ryan, who freed more than 150 stone cold killers off his state's death row.In his book tour, particularly on an appearance by Larry King, Kurtis shows that he is a tourist in the land of criminal justice. Those of us who live there know the facts are very different and while the system certainly makes mistakes, they are about as common as human rabies."
1,don't bother....,"So disappointed when I received this item; nowhere does it state that it is all made of MDF! Also, the veneer is a paper one! The price tag on this is too much ... for basically pressed sawdust and paper veneer. ... They really need to be more specific with what this is made of ... If I could give it a 0 star, I would. Also, the thing is so heavy!"
5,What a difference in my truck bed,"After intalling this product I have been able to use my bed for many different purposes, the soft bedliner material allows me to load fragile items into my bed without the risk of scratching or damaging it. Very easy to install, will take 2 people around an hour to install, since it velcro's to the bed and does take some precision lining up, but it came out perfect afrer I was done and gives my truck a different look. I was able to cut it pretty easy with a utility knife to allow openings for the cargo rings in my bed since they were not precut. Also makes tailgating very nice now since the material is so soft."
3,elevated by time,"elevated by time distance distance and more distance-- dogma is pristine history is pristine therefore... I couldn't find any mention of Romance Novels or Safeway in the book. American History? Plenty of ""original"" history. O.J. Simpson is not original history according to this book. Ask yourself what would be excluded by this book. Ask yourself this of any writing. American History? Pre-revolution. It begins at the beginning. Where am I? Here. The book is there. American history. Vietnamese-American history? hardly. Ask what gets excluded."
3,Not all that bad,"You get two in one set, only one has a small pocket. I was hoping to get a pocket big enough for a dredit card. However, the pocket is very small. You have to fold paper money significantly to put it inside.I guess it depends what you are hoping to get!"
5,"good album, great performers","I have really enjoyed this album, it has some really good sounds, and G.O.T. sounds even better live. They are great guys, they played a show for our youth group and they really put on a good performance even though it was a small crowd.I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys rock."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this item for my one year old son. I received the product realising that the supplier had the 'good' sense to leave the batteries inside. It must have been in there a while because the batteries leaked, stained and rusted the product and it is not working! I hope I get a refund."
5,Great travel toy,Took this on our first road trip with our 15 month old son. Kept him busy for at least 30 min at a time.
2,Tiny power,"My son loves to pretend to drive so my husband found this and was so excited. It was a hit in the house, then we brought it out to the car. Apparently if you live anywhere other than the tropics it won't work. We turn heat up until we're sweating and then it will work. Poor kid is sad, frequently ends up crying. Don't waste your money."
3,One minute Wonder Wheel,"That's how long my daughter played with it. Whenever I hand it to her she will press one or two buttons, then toss it down. It would have been so much better if it would also say the name of the animal instead of just the sound."
3,CAUTION: drivers not available on Sharp's website ....,"I would like to advise all current and potential owners of this model that Sharp does not post the drivers for the AM-900 on their website. Sharp will, however, charge you twenty-five dollars for a disk containig the driver software. (With shipping, my total was just under thirty-seven dollars). So, although I cannot speak to the printing quality of this model (my company has only one of these, and we just repurchased the driver software, so I therefore have not had a chance to fairly evaluate the printing charactresitics of the AM-900), I cannot recommend an all-in-one that requires a repurchase of the driver software (if you did not store the original in a safe place). Therefore, I suggest to current owners that you make a backup so you do not have to repurchase the driver software like I did."
3,Not Great,I've had this for a month now. It is reasonable but the driver seems to act up on me and I tried it on 2 different computers. Sent an email to sharp but they did not respond. It also keeps my computer for cleanly shutting down. I would have returned it if I still had the box.
2,Squeals like a stuck pig,"I would not recommend buying this printer. Mine is only 4000 copies old, has already gone through 3 toner cartridges, and emits a high-pitched earsplitting squeal when printing. Since it was still under warranty, I got Sharp to exchange it. Sharp customer service is fast and pleasant, but the problem remains unsolved. The replacement (refurbished) machine is even louder.I can't pinpoint the origin of the noise, except to say it is not the scanner unit. My guess is either the paper exit roller or the drum. The drum is not guaranteed, but should certainly last longer than 4000 copies. It also eats large quantities of toner while producing copies that are way too light. It is also considerably slower than the 12 sheets a minute it is rated."
3,Not recommended,"The AM-900 works as a copier, scanner, printer and fax.It is very noisy.It is slow.The toner is hard to find except at $99.00. It doesnot seem to last that long."
2,Terrible support!,If you want an opinion about this product: Do not buy it if you intend to upgrade to Windows Vista! I've been trying to find a solution for about three months. Sharp support contact do not answer e-mails!! It is a shame for such an acknowledged company!! No driver available for scanning on Windows Vista!
3,Helpful for Beginners,"When my daughter took her ideas for her wedding to our local florists, the estimates were over $3,000. When we finished laughing, we bought this book. Even though we had very little previous experience with florals, with a little practice we were able to make quite a few of the things she wanted ourselves. And perhaps more importantly, we were also able to determine what we couldn't do ourselves, and how best to work with a professional florist.We didn't use any of the designs from the book, but the clear photographs and step-by-step instructions made it well worth the price for the skill development it gave us."
5,"Good Basic, Traditional Design, How-To Book","From a bride who started by taking 2 years of design classes and creating her own bridal flowers to now a flourishing wedding floral business owner who creates custom wedding arrangements for brides all across the country, this book helped me get started. I review and purchase a lot of floral reference books for my design business, and when I started out, this was one of the better books I found on basic, traditional styles. The book is particularly helpful for the beginning designer as the clear photos and detailed, how-to steps are easy to follow. My only suggestion for improvement is to expand the book (or publish a second book) that lists advanced techniques and more contemporary, unique designs and florals/materials for the bride who desires something more unusual and creative. It's limited in the creativity it offers, but overall, it's one of the best BASIC books to reference and LEARN from. Good for beginners and floral students."
2,Not that good,"I didnt think this book was very good. I listened to the good reviews and bought the book, but I hated it. The arrangements were boring, not just simple but lame. roses, filler, lots of baby's breath in every bouquet. Nothing exciting or different. there were some basic step by step instruction about wiring flowers and using floral tape that I did find useful but other than that the pictures and example bouquets featured throughout the entire book were so boring and unimpressive. Not worth the money I paid."
3,"Good Instructions, Weak on Creativity","This is not the book to buy if you are looking for new and creative floral ideas for your wedding - you will be greatly disappointed. There are examples of each main different type of bouquet, such as nosegay, cascade, hand-tied, etc., but the ""variations"" shown for each type aren't anything to write home about. Look for another book if you are hoping to find something stellar and original that will stand out at your wedding.On the other hand, if you plan to arrange your own flowers like I do, the instructions are very well laid out with good detail and clear pictures...."
1,Useful Tips but Floral Arrangements are Dated,"I found the first few pages information about placing wire in flowers etc, however almost all of the arrangements were filled with ferns and really seemed dated and arrangements from the 80's. I didn't get a lot of inspiration or ideas. I really wish I hadn't spent money on this book."
3,Satisfied,"I was completely happy with the book I recieved, however I was very unhappy with the sender. I ordered the book 05/15 and was suppose to recieve it by 06/09 (that's still too long to wait for a book); after sending emails to the sender I finally recieved the book 06/15!"
3,ENJOYABLE,"Moonlight on Water is a pleasant read with good characters.Actually, I didn't read the book in english, I've read a copy in Portuguese (this book was translated)."
2,low level translation,"I actually do not know if the book is worth 5 stars or oneWhat i now that the translation is awful.i am not a Russian speaker but I am familiar a bit with Russian authors translated in other languages, and this translation hits the bottom. unreadable by any means."
5,"""The Loss"" is a delightful combination of humour and pathos.","The three interwoven narratives are funny, sad and poignant, and the hero is a combination of resolve and absurdity as he doggedly digs his tunnel. This is a charming story, beautifully told and translated."
4,"Great for Infants, Good for Toddlers","I think I was expecting a little more from this book, but once I started using it, I really liked it.It is VERY basic and perfect for my infant. But because it is so easy, it actually works for my toddlers, too. They have a verse to learn, a song to sing or game to play and a prayer to say. The book itself is VERY DURABLE so it is great for when little fingers want to look at it themselves!!!"
5,"Great little light, for half the price.","I bought one of these lights locally. Its great. Provides plenty of light, and even has hinges on the brackets allowing you to easily flip up the fixture for maintenance and cleaning. The brackets are also adjustable, so you don't need them at the end, or use them at all. At nearly half the price of the GLO lighting, I feel this is a better deal. I am currently planning to buy more for my other tanks. I would defiantly recommended these lights for a cheaper (and just as durable) option for many of the T5 lighting available. If this is Zoo Meds entry into the aquarium market, they are off to a great start!"
4,Good but a few complaints,"Good product, works as advertised. A few comments. Fixture does not include lamps, which is not explicitly stated that I could tell. I came to this conclusion before ordering, and think that it is still a decent value, but should be stated. Also, the fixture is rather deep, I am using it as a second light for a wide tanks, and it takes up a lot of room. The legs are very short, and are affixed to the fixture with a narrow tab of plastic that may be prone to break. I elected to use the included hanging kit, which works well."
5,Great light but short cord length,"I purchased this light fixture from amazon (does not include t5's) along with a couple light bulbs with it. Looks great on my 29gal but had to remove my glass cover... which i broke in the process anyway, because the mounting hardware that comes with it required me to. No big deal, I just have my tank open to air. The light can tilt up thanks to the hinged mounting hardware which is convenient. The light seems rugged and includes suspension hardware, and the aluminum reflector is quite excellent compared to my old fixture's skimpy reflector. The only dislike I have is that the cord length is only like 4 feet which isnt a big deal either if you have plugs available and your aquarium isnt on a skyscraper (my dresser). Great product, no problems, no complaints no improvement suggestions... except maybe different mounting options. None the less 5 stars."
4,Works very well,I used this in a custom 40 gal breeder aquarium hood. This would have been an easier install if it would have came with all the mounting hardware. Which it didn't come with the cable hanger. I just mounted it by screwing it in. I dont really use the switches but a nice feature. Reasoning for 4 stars is the missing mounting hardware.
2,Neat packaging; if only it was substantial & not so misleading to the normal eye.,"I wish I would've paid attention to the ingredients a little bit more and noticed that this conatains that garbage of a product name ""Splenda"". It's conveniently named ""Sucralose"" to trick you into believing it's natural. Besides the fact that there are studies proving its harmful effects on the body, it also leaves one the worst aftertaste I've tasted. I've studied nutrition, so I'm actually ashamed that I've been this easily mislead. Do yourself a favor and buy a product with Dextrose or Fructose as a primary sweetener; you'll be thankful later with your uptake and absorption."
3,Open seal,"First time I ordered it was fine, however this time the paper seal under the top was ripped. Powder had fallen into the package."
3,Not worth it,Stuff is good but just too overpriced IMO. Does not offer a good bang for your buck. And the scoops are too big.
2,Did not like the taste,"I only didn't give this one star because the nutrition facts were in line for what the product promised, but I did not like the taste at all. I followed the instructions and the consistency was disgusting. I felt like I was eating sludge. I tried it several times to see if I would get used to the taste, but that never happened. After a few times of trying this I ended up throwing more than half the product away."
2,building bodies,way to many cals for me. this is for people with high burn rates or some one looking to gain a lot of mass
2,did the formula change?,"This was a good product when I bought it from Amazon in the past. But this last one I got, in July 2012, is different. It now mixes very poorly, and has many gross jelly-powder chunks that will not mix no matter how much you shake. Maybe I just got a bad batch, and I'll probably give it one more try in the future. If I do discover that this was simply a bad batch, I'll then review it again more favorably. Too expensive to throw out, so I guess I'll be choking it down until it's gone."
5,Excellent Product,"After a bit of research and comparison, I finally bought container of this to try. It's amazing.The taste is great. The results are even better. To be honest, I haven't made a shake with just water yet. I've only used milk thus far.The only downside is that there's only 18 servings in a 5.75 lb container. I'm drinking one shake per day so I expect to be ordering more very soon...If you need a blender bottle to go with this, make sure you get the 28 oz one. 16 oz of liquid plus the three scoops of powdered mix makes for about a 20 oz shake. The extra 8 ounces in the bottle makes it possible to actually mix the contents. Any smaller and it would take a very very long time to mix a shake."
5,Great for High Metabolism (Hardgainers),"All flavores of TrueMass taste great. For the price and the ratio of Proteins and Carbs, this is all I drink now. I am a hardgainer (slender build, high metabolism, put on lean muscle quick but muscle comes off quick too unless I'm eating a ton, so these shakes are a necessity for me)"
5,"Very good, mixes well and tastes good.","It mixes much better than other gainers, tastes good and best of all it works. I have gained weight on it. Shipping was fast too.Thanks"
1,Will not buy it again..Beware..It's causing diarrhea,It's a very bad product(but not for all)I see some people are reporting about gas problem and bloating.They are also true.i do have same problem with this one.Also i read some review that it's causing diarrhea and few people reported that they need to visit restroom right after drinking BSN True-mass!!!!!
4,When normal food just won't give you enough protein.,"It mixes well with water, milk, and soymilk. The flavor is one of the best I have tasted. The price is a little more than what I want to pay but I don't regret buying the product."
4,Great Price for the Product!,Great Price for the Product. The items is exactly what you get from local retailers and for a lot less.
4,I like it! Its builds Mass and helps with Recovery time!,"I bought a massive Jug of this stuff not to long ago and am now about half way through it. The flavor I got is called Chocolate MilkShake and is very good. A bit thick but with 630 calories per serving, it should be! I use as a great morning snack, or after the gym cause it does provide u with 15grams of protien a scoop and every 3 scoops is considered one serving but I use less cause my goal is not to gain weight right now, just use it for the extra calories and great protein isolate it has in it! I use it in combination with a regular Whey protien powder as well so I can ajust how many calories or protiens I want or need after every workout! Reviewed by: Chris Berrier-"
4,Awesome Product.,"I love this product. Mixes great, tastes better. It has awesome nutritional value with the vitamins, calories, and protein. My only bad thing is the price. Its awesome!"
1,not a gramm gained,"So what's exactly the point of a weight gainer which doesn't make you gain weight? ... Exactly - none! Thats as well the amount of kilos I gained drinking at least two servings of this useless product a day (over a time-span of about 3 and a half weeks + being on a strict meal plan). Might just be my body, but I digested it well and liked drinking it due to its pretty nice taste. I simply wanted a product which supports me in reaching my goal of adding mass and in this regard ""True Mass"" absolutely failed.If ""True Mass"" would be any other kind of ""non-consumable"" product I'd send it back right away, as it did not bring along the results it promised. Unfortunately the nice red 5.75 Pound thingy is all empty now and I feel like I got screwed over by all those reviews making love with BSN.Don't buy it just cuz it looks pretty and tastes like Ice-Cream."
2,True Mass....,"Got hooked on BSN products thru NO Xplode. Lots of magnesium in this (and NO and CellMass), too much magnesium makes you have diarrhea. I wouldn't recommend this or any other BSN product because they are all loaded with Magnesium. Beware. Plus TureMass is way expensive. You can find a lot of products for way less money, that have way less ingredients(this has a lot of extra stuff to make it look better). I'd recommend Optimum Nutrition. Good luck."
1,taste like sh#!,If you like to gag before your breakfast then by all means purchase this. I love the vanilla from this brand but comparing these two is like night and day.please do yourself a favor and stay off the cookies. You will thank me later.
4,It's Good,I like the taste and it's high calorie.I gained some lean muscle using this product.Wish it were cheaper.Other products have 50 servings this one is only 18.
4,"BSN ""True-Mass"" 5.75 lbs. is a great buy for the price",BSN makes professional quality mass gaining products bars and powders. True-Mass 5.75 lbs was a great buy for the price. Especially considering its high pH levels to slow intake for long term protein intake. So far I can say it is great.
5,Tastes Great,"Combine some milk, frozen bananas, and a few cubes of ice and blend a great tasting shake that feels like a dessert. This brand is a little pricey, but the taste is worth the extra dough."
3,Good Product,I purchaed this product and think it works pretty well. it tastes pretty good too and actually did what it promised. good amount of product and reasonable price compare to other retailers!
3,Vanilla ice cream,It tastes nasty. doesnt taste as good as it supposed to be. nothing like vanilla. should have ordered strawberry instead but amazon didn have it. hope they have it buy now cuz i really need the strawberry (hopefully that tastes like it has strawberry flavor).
4,Vanilla Ice Cream tastes fantastic,"I've been drinking true mass for a few months now. I've tried the vanilla ice cream, cookies and cream as well as chocolate. Out of the three flavors, the vanilla ice cream is the best.Cookies and cream leaves little black ""bits"" in the shake which usually just settles to the bottom of the glass and makes you chew a little bit if not.Chocolate tastes similar to much cheaper gainers out there, with a chalky texture, Definitely a chore to drink from the first shake to the last, never got any better. I say avoid this flavor if you are buying these based on taste.I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars, because the two flavors which I wasn't satisfied with. Vanilla would definitely get 6 out of 5 stars if that was possible."
4,Very Good Gainer,"This gainer is very good. I now believe BSN uses high quality ingredients. I normally have an intolerance, and many other products upset my stomach. But I seem to do just fine with the BSN product line up. Tastes is not bad, I was hoping it would taste as good as syntha6. I shake in water, mixes well. It has a good amount of protein in it as well. The down is you only get 18 servings! Some days I'm downing 3 or more servings. This thing will be gone in 1 week at that rate. Ended having to subscribe to this stuff. I'm an ectomorph with a ridicules BMR. For others , you should be able to make this stuff last. I think BSN protein blend is the best thus far."
5,yum,"I really love the taste of this stuff because it doesn't taste like sand or chalk lol. It mixes perfectly with peanut butter and bannans, ice and milk for an awesome shake!"
3,Taste,"I thought the taste was tolerable, I do not think it had much of a cookies and cream taste, More of a powder milk taste, it was tolerable..but not fantastic."
2,Good but not for me,"I followed instructions, but did not help me much. I had a milk shake in the morning, one during the day, and one before my work out. I did increase weight the first two weeks but after that i did not see much improvement. I am trying to understand my body, i know this product does work for someone but now not for me."
1,Bamboo Steamer,No matter how many times I cleaned and used this steamer I could not get the plain WOOD taste out of my food im so sure it is bamboo since true bamboo doesnt do this.
3,I may be doing something wrong,"It sticks your dumblings all over, when you try to remove them after steam they are undercook on top and sticky and glue to the bottom. It may be a good product if you know what you are doing. I even watch videos online and is just not working for me."
4,Gift,"I bought the bamboo steamer as a present for my mother. She hasn't even had a chance to use it yet, but is very excited to try it out."
4,new to steaming,this works great for someone new to steaming. Later I will probably get a bigger one. Have used this for veggies & fish. Clean-up is easy and the size works for a single person. Thanks for a quality product.
3,Does the job but the fit is not ideal,I bought this steamer with the ring setup so i can use a stockpot for my steam as opposed to a wok. I suggest liner sheets also available on amazon that fit the 10 inch model. With all three you should have little difficulty steaming food. My only complaint is the round sections are not rounded properly and they dont fit together without finding that sweet spot where they drop into place perfectly. This means it was made cheaply and poorly. What a surprise!
3,No better than a corkscrew,"I don't get it, sorry. This thing works, but is not any easier to use than a corkscrew. It takes a fair amount of force to pierce the cork with the needle, more force than it takes to use a corkscrew. I even tried a drop of walnut oil (almost tasteless) to lubricate the needle, but it didn't seem to help. I do, however, like the ""festive"" pop it makes."
5,best wine opener ever,I love this wine opener. Actually got one for a gift about 10 years ago. Try to use it every day!!! (I wish) Bought more for gifts. Still using my original. Super easy. 3 seconds to open a bottle.
1,Product did not work as I had expected.,Product was difficult to insert. After insertion gas was directed into the wine. As a result the wine erupted when the cork came out. Used an excessive amount of gas to expel cork. Cartridge was useable for only a few bottles. Company Rep indicated there was no defect in the product. Also the product can only be used with standard 750 ml. bottles. This last fact was only seen after I received the item. Not agood experience!
4,Like It!,"Have had mine for a couple of years and think it's the best wine bottle opener I've ever owned. Need to be careful not to bend the needle when inserting into the cork or it can be bent fairly easily (this is my 2nd one because of what I just warned about!). Gas cartridges last well, IF you, ""help"" the removal along by lifting a little after a quick infusion of gas. i.e. If you supply enough gas for it to remove the cork on its own, the life of the cartridges is shortened significantly. Practice makes perfect."
2,Good picture horrible company,"The picture on the 50"" plasma is good, the company support is awful. I purchased the set and it had a white powder between the screens. I have made numerous phone calls and have gotten no response from either the seller or Zenith. I purchased a Zenith dvd/vcr combo player at the same time and the dvd quit working 60 days after purchase.The Plasma runs very hot, the color and brightness are both good. If I were to buy today I would go with the LCD tv's and would not even consider a Zenith product."
4,WILD with a capital W,"Willy could never hope to reproduce the experience of his live performances in any kind of plastic but this CD is the next best thing. despite the eccentric recording quality and Willys bizarre personality the virtuosity shines through.The sound ,definitely different,definitely entertaining can do nothing more than whet the appetite .The old adage runs true ,you've got to see it to believe it."
1,Not Exactly Right,"There is much more to the story than this and there IS in fact a bias on the part of the writer.Not to mention the literal slaughter of white settlers,which was the case in many many instances,I believe is very sorry.The corrections are too numerous to list here and this is really more of a response than this book deserves...."
1,Too Small!,"I received this case as a gift. I own an Ashley harp. It is a nice case, but unfortunately, it is too small. The zipper broke almost immediately when I tried to fit it around the harp. I was really disappointed, but I still tried to use it anyway. I taped it shut with duct tape. However, the case was still so tight that I broke one of my levers."
5,excellent story and characters - a very solid debut!,"Centering around Terence, a poet dealing with some drastic life-changing issues during the summer before his senior year of college, the story is crafted in a hip hopified script that flows like music and is full of satire and wit. As Terence goes deeper on his journey, the story yields a number of messages to reflect on, especially through the powerful dialogues with his crew. Ultimately, the book captures the true essence of life and exploration, showing us just how important people and words (written and spoken) really are.The author does an excellent job in bringing the supporting characters to life. The interactions between them and Terence ranged from playful to down home heart-to-hearts, but all were realistic and well-written.Looking for more good things from Vincent Williams."
4,Temples is one of the most interesting books I've read,"Temples made me think a lot and remember when. Temples held my interest til the last page. Everyone needs someone like Maya in their lives, the one person who keeps your feet on the ground. A really good one nighter."
2,RPG??? I think not..,"This game is classified as an RPG right???? Well where is the RPG in it?? I'll I see is a Shoot'em up game. I was eager to play this game due to the fact the previous Phantasy Stars were really good. If I wanted a shoot'em up game I would have bought Quake 3 arena. It is an absolute disgrace to call this an RPG. If you are a die hard RPG, which I am, don't bought this game. Sell you're dreamcast and get Psx and buy Final Fantasy 9 instead. The only cool thing about this game is that you can set your characters weight, height and features. that is about it. So bottom line is that Sega flopped this one just like they do everything else. I'll stick with my Psx and Final Fantasy 9 thank you very much."
1,BORING,This game was fun online but when u weren't able to get online it was boring. This game is NOT worth the price!!
2,The future of rpg games?,"I bought this game with high expectations, but was rather disapointed after several hours of play. The graphics do not apear to be much better than PSX quality. The game itself looks and plays like a bad clone of Jetforce Gemeni for the N64. After spending an hour of trying to find some one who would join me online (I couldn't find anyone who would), I went offline and played for a while. The game played more like a shooter than a rpg. As a fan of Phantasy Star 1-4, I was expecting something better. I strongly advise a rental before buying to see if this game is your thing."
4,"Cool Game, But It Needs More Role Playing and Less Shooting","I've been a Phantasy Star fan since Phantasy Star II, and always the gameplay was dungeons-talking-more dungeons and so on, but this game it's all shooting-that-monster style, the graphics are cools, but let's face it, it could've been better...The Sonic team did a good job, but this game doesn't look like a Phantasy Star at all, you know it has a real lack of role playing in the offline mode, it's quite linear...now in the OnLine mode you can interact with other player around the world, that's new for us in the hard core console gamer, the game is still linear but the online mode add a new dimension in the gameplay...I'd say this game is for those who are used to play online games like Ultima On Line...but for the true Phantasy Star fan it'll be a dissapointment...The Phantasy Star franchise got comercial just like Metallica, Korn and Rage Against the Machine did..."
3,could have been better,yes this game was very addicting at first and yes i had no social life while i was playing it. but after awhile going through the same 4 levles over and over gets boring. the tremendous lack of a complete story line made this game suffer too. all the good weapons were just too hard to find. i was hooked until i got to lvl 90 but after that it was just too menotenous. the whole online concept was great. but the trading system was bad. it was to easy to have people steal from you. all in all it was a good gae but so many things could use improving...
3,You dont have to be online to play this.,I recently started playing Phantasy Star Online Offline and I have to say its really fun. If you've ever played it online during the days of seganet it is difficult going back to the mother ship and not seeing anyone around the shops yet there are thousands of missions to play. These missions were designed to play with others and offline they can be a bit repetitive yet the boss monsters are huge wih geat powers coupled with a great soundtrack and it still has the ability to emmerse you.ProsMany different weapons can be boughtcool NPC to enteract withSoundtrackboss'sConsRepetitive gameplayNo teamatesthat bright sunshine!! my freaking eyes!! ouch!!
3,Phantasy Star Online,"In the history of RPGs, one series has always been on the forefront of innovation. The first one helped define a genre, while the second ushered in the age of 16-bit RPGs. Now, the dawn of a new world is at hand. Sonic Team presents Phantasy Star Online, the first massively multiplayer RPG designed for a home console. Explore distant lands--with Phantasy Star Online, RPG gaming has no boundaries.This game is worth every penny i would reconmend getting it for gamecube so you can still play online."
5,Welcome to Ragol your mission awaits you,This game is one of the best games ever made for the now extinct sega dreamcast. It still has some of the best graphics i have ever seen in a video game and it has withstood the test of time. This is a game that i picked up off a friend and then picked up a friend off the game. THe online gampelay was great but is no more. The gameplay is simple but never the less very entertaining. The sound was some of the best i have ever seen in a video game. This game was a breakthrough in its day and is still great fun to play. What ever did happen to the Pioneer 1?Pick this game up and find out
5,I Love this game,"Why do i and so many other people love this game so much? imean wehn it gets right down to it there is no story, and virtually nogameplay. but unlike most RPG's that envelop you in a deep story,this one grabs... with its addictive leveling up system. now i knowthis may seem crazy and wierd, but just the fact that you can levelupin this game is amzing. i found myself constantly saying ""just afew more experince points untill teh next level. but guess whut. ikept going, its just something about leveling up that gets me soaddicted to this game. and dont even get me started on the gobs ofRare weapons to be found. these rares make the game fun because itsall about the mystery of when and if u will find that one super rareweapon that no one else has. and when u finally get that one singleultra rare weapon it makes you feel like u accomplished something, itmakes you want to keep going. so stop reading all those bad reviewsand go buy the game."
1,Don't buy this if you're planning to actually play it.,"Now, I've played the later iterations of Phantasy Star, and I loved them. So I bought this to go with my shiny new Dreamcast, thinking I'd like this one as well. And I'm sure I would have...if it worked at all.Let me be the one to tell you, fellow shopper, because no one told me: to play this, you need a Dreamcast modem, which is quite frankly impossible to find anymore, a constant wired connection to a Sega server, and a special serial code, both of which do not exist anymore unless you want to go the hacking route and use cracked codes and private servers, one of which I'm fairly sure is still illegal and the other of which is time-consuming and requires lots of programming knowledge. In short, you can boot it up, and you can look at it, but there is nothing short of hacking that will allow you to play this. Do not buy, this is a collector piece ONLY, because it has ceased to be functional."
5,HUGE! Fun and Lasting!,"This castle is well worth the money. We found ours on sale last season for $65. My son was thrilled on Christmas morning! He's played with it off and on all year. It is huge, so make sure you have the room. Make sure you buy the catapult to go with it."
1,Waste of space,"This product is a waste of space. 1 star is too generous but I dunno how to remove the star and at least it finally worked. I should have read the reviews here before I bought this thing. Like others, this thing needs to reset itself, but as soon as you try to move it across the drywall, it loses it and starts buzzing an error and you need to stop, reset, and try again. I tried moving my hand really slowly and made sure the device maintained full contact with the wall. Took several trial and errors but it did finally detect a stud. Very irritating to use and requires a LOT of patience. Too sensitive to motion, not worth the price."
1,"Horrible with a capital ""H""","I bought this unit from Home Depot because it's the only brand of stud-finder they seem to carry in my area. It simply does not function. When I held the unit to the wall and pressed the button to ""calibrate"", all I got was a flashing screen and absolutely no stud-finding. I thought perhaps the batteries that it came with were poor so I changed them. Same result. Stay away from this POS."
1,Useless even at the price one paid for it !!,"Bought it at Lowe's at the $24.95 sticker price thinking it must be a better one compared to the cheapest $10.95 model.. I was wrong :).. this one turned out to be a useless piece of equipment which took me atleast an hour more to get the mirror up on the wall compared to how much it would have taken me otherwise.. Novice user, so came here to confirm the findings and viola, I wasn't the only one :)"
1,DOA,Gave 1 star rating because that's the lowest possible.Read good reviews about the Zircon TriScanner Pro. Home Depot & Lowe's did not carry that model. I bought this model (Pro LCD)instead. Would not power on & could not get anything to work. I plan on returning it today.I was able to find the TriScanner Pro (retails for about 31.00) for about $24.00 including shipping on Amazon. Ordered it last night. Hopefully results will be better.
5,An excelent investment.,This is the greatest thing I've ever bought as a musician. I was pretty much stuck on a plateu before I bought this pedal and after I did it allowed me to further my self very easily musically. It's super sturdy and completely compatible with all my pedals. I highly recomend this pedal board as a cheap and efficient way to further yourself in whatever style of music you pursue.
3,It's HUGE,"I do not own this pedal board, but the guitarist in my band does. It has a great hardshell cover but it takes up a massive amount of floor space, which is inconvenient for us as our practice space is the typical size (small) and there are five of us. The way the power cord is designed, people are constantly stepping on it and unplugging it while attempting to cross the room to get to the beer fridge. It also takes up a massive amount of space on stage, as well, about the same amount of room as another person would take.This thing will hold a ton of pedals, and maybe one day he'll have enough to fill it, and maybe one day we'll have a set where it's necessary to have all of his pedals with him at once.So just a heads up, this thing is big and heavy, as big and heavy as having another instrument. If you have a LOT of pedals that you use all the time, however, and have a lot of room in your practice space and on stage, this is a great pedal board."
5,Great product!,"Ample room, power supply works perfectly and built like a tank. If you use a lot of pedals, this is the perfect pedal board for you. It's worth the price. Velcro works great...although you probably need a little more than what comes with it because there's so much space on the board for pedals."
3,Off to a Rocky start,"Overall I really like the SKB pedal board. The construction is as described and I take them at their word re: the lifetime warranty. I was however really disappointed when I plugged it in and had no power. Luckily I have some technical skills and upon opening the powerbar discovered that the hot wire had come loose from its connector. With a crimping tool I re-connected the loose wire and it works fine. This was not something the vendor would know about a product in a sealed package, but it was not picked up on by the manufacturer. Makes you wonder if quality assurance was doing their job. Most folks would not have the courage to open something and would most likely have sent it back. A small fix but it got us off to a rocky start."
4,wheels,"it's considerably a big size case and it gets quite haevy and bulky when fully loaded. this would be a better product if factory can come out with wheels and handle like one of those backpack.other than that, it's a good stuff."
4,Transitional music between gospel and country,"These songs were recorded when the Oaks were in transition from gospel to country. I like the songs still. They're good at country but will never be as good as when they were gospel. They belong in gospel and they know it, every one of them. Get off the money wagon, Oaks you've made enough. Get back to your roots. How about an old gospel reunion with Willie Wynn, Little Stevie Sanders, et al. Is Hermann Harper still alive? Bury the hatchet, guys. Didn't think we remembered, huh ? I cut my teeth on Oak Ridge Gospel. I want a cd remake of the ""Street Gospel"" album. Yes, I have some newer and older stuff. I like it all but won't buy any more country cds. Maybe Bill Gaither can help you guys get it back together. Give it a shot. I know you'll read this if printed on this site. Respectfully submitted, and thanks."
4,check the specs first,"ok, for 10k, its liscenced for 20 computers. That is that main reason it is so expensive. Aside from the price, if you are a real designer, font folio will provide you with every font you would ever want to use in a design. Forget about downloading free fonts. They are all pretty much crap aside from a very few mediocre web sites. And as far as making your own, I hope you have been to graphic design school and have training in typography so you are not polluting the already oversaturated world of home-made fonts."
1,"10k - font - umm, no?","10,000 bucks for fonts...wow...You can download fonts online anywhere for free, you can make your own, and if you really need a professional font for a web page or something just buy that font for [a lot less money] online... I just wanted to share my $.02"
1,Labtop/ Notebooks,"I had the worst experience with buying a laptop on line. Not only did was it seven years old, there were a lot of minor problems. I called the company an he not only made excuses on why it didn't work but he tryed to sell me the items to fix it. Loser!"
1,The worst item you can buy!!!,"I rate my item 0 a big 0 I have never used it, it was shipped to me very dirty and it was not like how it was looking on the add, it was sent to me with a broken battery, the screen was really really dirty that there was candy sticking on the screen and it was sticky. I have wrote to the guy that sold it to me and he didnt have the nerve to write me back. I hope that the amazon corporate office see this scam and take consideration.I am NOT HAPPY!!!"
5,Laptop,"A reasonable compact laptop, with a limited memory and storage, just right for a schoolkid like my nephew to take his work to and from school. nice and light weight.It does the job efficienly, no frills."
3,Jennifer's Review,Was some damage done to the laptop either during shipping or was shipped with the indention in the back corner of the laptop. The laptop does work well and came with all of the software that the seller stated would be on the laptop. I am satisfied with my purchase.
1,"DON""T BUY!!! TERRIBLE LAPTOP!!!","I was reviewing another item and this laptop popped up asking if I would like to review it. I purchased this in 2008 and I had it for such a short period I forgot about it. What a piece of junk! It worked for about 3 months and then completely crashed. Terrible product; do not buy, spend your money on something newer and better."
5,This book is worth EVERY penny!,"After searching the net and bookstores for months, I came across this book. It is THE best book on fishing you will find period. The pictures are amazing, but the information it provides is by far the best part. It tells you HOW to fish for every kind of freshwater fish there is. Trust me, you will love it."
5,Totally Awesome,"Where else can you find Skip James and Son House in the same place? Well, this is one of two DVDs that I know of. And where else can you see Son House dance?! No place that I know of. Both of these artists give totally inspired performances. Son House's eyes roll back in his head and he swings his arm when he plays. It's almost as powerful to just watch him--with the sound off. Howlin' Wolf chastises Son House, telling him that he hasn't done anything with his life when Son interrupts his performance (someone gave him whiskey...). Everything is great, although the lighting could bear to be a bit better. Also, if you plan on using this DVD to learn stuff on guitar, you'd be better off getting the Blues Festival vol. Three DVD. The lighting is better and they give some pretty good close-ups of Skip."
4,A Down Home Gathering of Bluesmasters,"Before one starts to be critical about the technical expertise of this documentary, one needs to remember that this was filmed in 1966. All performers were at their peak of their careers and were natural and unpretentious while being filmed. Howlin Wolf and Son House had an interesting dialoge about Howlin's definition of the blues. I am pleased with the performances, the camera is blocked by a dancer or two, but only briefly. If you are a real fan of Son House, Bukka White and Howlin Wolf, you will not be dissapointed."
4,Pretty good,"This is pretty good. But the cover has a picture of Son House, and he only performs one song, and not quite in its entirety! You do get to see him dance for a minute and hear him off screen talking to Howling Wolf. The cover should have had Howling Wolf on it instead of Son House, so it wouldn't be misleading. I like Howling Wolf, but I bought this specifically to see footage of Son House. But ofcourse Wolf is good so I gave it 4 stars.And the tiny bit of footage of Son House is AWESOME, I wish it'd had much much more of him."
1,"Interesting concept, but DISAPPOINTING!!","This book lost me with the CONSTANT examples. There is literally a different example ON EVERY PAGE! There was one small point that would interest me and then before the author had a chance to explain we were on to Mary or Tom or Suzi who had this experience. THE EXAMPLES ARE VERY DISTRACTING!I had high hopes and I think there's good information in there, if you can stand the incessant examples. I couldn't!"
2,"lots of stories, little advice","I agree with a previous poster. This book is filled with one and two paragraph examples of what other people have experienced, but provides very little guidance on what to do big picture. As I started the book I was somewhat satisfied because I could definitely identify with some of the stories, but as the book continued, I continued to get more and more dissatisfied because I felt there was no real suggested path to solve such issues."
5,Strongly Recommended,"I thought the book was great. I never purchased a ""Self Help"" book before and therefore was skeptical. It was recommended to me by a girlfriend of mine and I thought I would give it a try. After reading it, I was glad I did. I found it helpful in understanding not only my mother, but myself as well. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,"Not as good as ""Making Peace with your Parents""","Although they contain similar advice and this book is almost 20 years newer, it is not nearly as direct and helpful as Making Peace with Your Parents by Harold Md Bloomfield. I was looking for more specific advice on identifying issues and how to work through them rather than long passages about many peoples' situations with very little guidance on how to apply the advice and work through the issues. Disappointed and more appreciative of what a great book Dr. Bloomfield put together so long ago!"
4,fun...but a bit high maintenance.,"I really like this wok.I even really like the 'cheap' chinese style bamboo spatula that comes with it. (it is probably the most perfect shape and weight for stir-frying...its not awekward at all...at least its what I'm used to.)I have to say though- the seasoning is hard to get right. And after multiple attempts...after multiple times the seasoning didn't stick...i have to say- for all its merits- if you are looking for a ""carefree"" wok- dont get this one.if however, you want a quality item and don't mind putting in the work- I recomend this it =)"
4,I love it,"I use it everyday. Love it. Good and very roomy for frying. A little too heavy for me. It gets rusty very easily so every time I wash it, I dry it with a paper towel and wipe several oil around. Oil will keep it from getting rusty!"
2,Very high maintenance,"I like to steam my veggies and that destroys the seasoning. Very high maintenance wok! Heats up only at the bottom. Rusts easily and everything I cook turns black beacuse of reacting with the carbon steel.Update: I still have this in my kitchen because I couldn't find anything else in this size/shape, and I need it for stir frying big veggies in big portions."
2,Not for the casual cook!,"This wok requires seasoning, something I was totally unprepared for. I am a casual cook who just wanted to wok around a little. Additionally, there was no warning that seasoning a wok on an electric stove is extremely difficult. Once the wok is seasoned (good luck!), it requires much extra care, and can never be washed with soap. Try the non-stick version of this or any wok if you, like me, are a casual cook."
1,"rusty, heavy, sticky","i bought it a month ago, and threw it out already. it was terrible, rusty easily, sticky to foods when cooking, terrible experience. i bought another cast iron wok instead, much better."
5,I love this wok!,"This is the second wok I have owned, and by far, THE BEST! If you follow the seasoning directions, it won't rust. Food cooks up just wonderfully. You can't go wrong with this wok!Hint: For added protection, whenever I'm finished using it, I heat it up again with a little oil so that I can ensure that it has thoroughly dried and it adds a little extra protection. This process may not be necessary, but I do it anyway just in case."
4,little but mighty,"A GREAT TAMBOURINE...nicesound, good quality. The head makes a wonderful scratchy sound when you run your hand across it. I am very pleased."
5,"Awesome for kids, but not great for a musician","We got this for my daughter and she LOVES it! She was around 6 months old when we got it. Now that she's a year, it's still in great shape and she plays it all the time (and is constantly hitting it with other, harder toys). It's still holding up!If you're not buying this for a kid, it's maybe not what you're looking for. It's pretty small, which is perfect for children, but I can't see it suiting an adult's needs."
4,Latin Percussion Tambourine CP376,"For some reason I thought this was bigger, until I realized that the seemingly random ""6"" in the name of this product must stand for 6 inches. Still, it delivers a decent sounding tambourine."
3,"A. Weiss, author of the BackSmart Fitness Plan",When I picked up this book I thought it would be useful considering it is one of the few books out there to take an different approach to back pain. The only thing is the exercises are overall do not engage your spinal structure nor your core muscle groups for every day activites.
4,5 stars minus one,"Most of this collection earns 5 stars : all the hits, a great selection of other tracks(including the otherwise-hard-to-find ""Bulldog""), original recordings, excellent sound quality. Docked a star for the last two tracks : original recordings overdubbed by a hack studio drummer (or - Heaven help us - a drum machine) for no apparent reason. What a travesty! Won't somebody save us from these remixes?!"
2,Small chunks with little flavor,"I was quite disappointed with this product. The company shipped it promptly and I could hardly wait to try it out. I have tried it in gravy and soup and neither has made me think remotely of chicken. I have cooked with plain TVP in granules and larger chunks before so I knew I would not be getting ""chicken"" but the chewiness of larger TVP chunks was missing in these smaller bits and I felt the flavor did not enhance the foods it was added to.There are trans fats in it, also, making it not a healthy option for vegetarian eating, either.The chickeny flavor of this product reminds me of the flavor of crackers that claim to be chicken flavored. If you like those you might like this."
2,Not Chunks,Product review says that these are chunks.....they are not and come as little pieces and are not as stated. Might be good as a ground option but these were purchased to be used as chunks and are useless for what I had planned.
4,Just one of those things,This is the first book I have read by Leigh Riker. I loved it! I have added her to my favorite author list. The story was very true to life. This modern day romance really kept me reading... I never wanted to put it down. I have two more books by Leigh and am looking forward to finding the others (which are out of print).
1,"Faulty device that destroyed 4 16 GB SD card of mine, no one accepted responsibility","I purchased these, with 4 16 GB SD cards. The cards were working perfectly, since I used them in my camera and my computer. As soon as I put the SD cards in these readers, they stopped working. Why? I have no idea. Then the card stopped working with other devices too. I checked all 4 readers and unfortunately they destroyed all my 4 SD cards, none of them readable by any other device.I contacted seller. They were nice, but didn't accept any responsibility. The only thing they said, was that they will check the readers from now on to be sure something like this will not happen again. They sent me 4 new readers that are working fine, at least for the past few hours.So, if you buy these readers, before inserting your SD card, check to be sure they are working fine. You can do it by using an old SD card without any info or picture on it. This way, you will not lose any file, but might lose the card itself."
1,Does not work,"Received the item, no problem.Plugged in SD card into device, no problem.Plugged into computer, expecting to see it pop up- no connection.This product doesn't work.3$ or not, I expect a product to work."
3,treemonger,I thought it would do 8gb of memory but will not do that only small but does a very good job one smaller gb memory cards
1,Only worked twice,"Piece of junk. No domumentation, SD card fits sloppy. USB connector is sloppy. The third time I tried to use it my computer calls it an unknown device with no driver."
5,good price. no problems,i was very pleased to find this product and it's nice that i can use it for my micro and regular sd cards.
1,Horrible,i bought this item thought it would be nice for a temporary card reader and it only worked once. when i tried to use it again the computer would not recognize it and when i pulled it out the reader fell apart. bought it brand new i would not recomend this to anyone.
5,"Easy to use, works well","Really straight forward - just stick the memory card in it, plug it into your USB drive, and you can transfer pictures, videos, etc. straight onto it or delete them off of it. Inexpensive, small, practical. Basically ideal."
4,Pretty good,"This card reader always works, unlike other card readers I've used previously. Fast shipping, great seller.Update: after using this product for about a year, it eventually cracked. I gave it some abuse though and likely cracked the plastic myself through excess pressure. Still, it isn't bulletproof."
1,bad!,"I bought this one 4 months ago, it worked fine for 4 months and it stopped working...it is also bulky so that if you have two usb ports next to each other, you cant use both ports at the same time.don't waste your money on this item. buy a better one that works better and longer."
2,Not Worth The Price...,"I have ordered two, all have stopped working within a couple of weeks of use. I even complained to the sender and they replaced one of them and that also lasted a couple of weeks. They all work fine at first, but they all stop working after a a couple of weeks use. I use it my in my car's stereo's USB reader. I have a 4g SDHC Card; which I use to store my favorite MP3 tunes. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I would definately stay way from this product; as the saying goes: ""you get what you pay for"""
4,the must have for the person on the go,Since I pretty much live out of my suitecase. I forget my usb cord for my cams all the time so i got this 10 in 1 reader so I can plug it up to my lap top and I have no prbs. I liked it so much i bought 2 one for home and 1 for the house. A good buy if you are like me on the road alot.
1,Short life span.,I have half a dozen of SD cards from different devices and I needed a USB pen drive so I decided to buy a USB memory card reader so I could give the cards some use and skip buying another memory device. I have to say that the product looks good. It wasn't that good from the beginning it took some time for any of my computers to recognize the card but the data transfer rate was really good. It lasted a month. After which stopped working. I had the hunch that it would be like that because it used to get very hot and that is a bad symptom for electronic devices.I wont recommend to buy this model. I'm looking now for a new one and lets see how the next brand works.
4,Neat gadget,A great little piece of technology. I can take my camera flash card and this gadget anywhere. Makes showing pictures to friends and co-workers easy. Technology at its best.
1,NOT WHAT AVERTIZED,DID NOT WORK WITH XPSELLER CONTACTED THEY INSISTED IT WAS MY COMPUTERNOW OWNER OF UNWANTED PRODUCT
4,works Great,just got it two days a go been using it ever scene working good can put card in side and close it up to look and act like a usb stick if you don't have a card slot on your computer just bee aware of the delivery price to get around this order more than one
5,Solid performance for a few dollars,"Pretty dang fast on my 4 Gig SD card. Performance solid, only caveat is body is a bit thicker than i'd wish, takes up more room on hub than previous SD reader sticks. HIGHLY recommneded"
3,ok,It worked for about 3 months then broke. But you can't beat the price. I don't see anything but a SD card fitting in it but I didn't try.
1,Garbage,Durability is terrible along with the soldering on the circuit board. Looks nice but it's just another hunk of Chinese made junk....
4,Unbeatable price,"I have not had any problems getting this device to work. It reads my SD card perfectly.My only complaint is that the caps keep falling off. But for the price I paid for this, I can let that minor problem go."
1,WORTHLESS . . . even for a penny,Not only was this device not for the size card I was told but when I used the appropriate size card for this reader it did not work with 3 different computers. I WASTED $3.00 because they shipped it in a box instead of a padded envelope and charged me nearly $3.00 for shipping.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR MONEY ORDERING THIS ITEM!
1,Worked a couple of times,"This thing worked a couple of times and is dead. The light still lights up when it's plugged in, but it does not recognize the cards inside. I used to have the same one before that lasted me for a year. It might have been slighly different, but similar appearance. But this one was a disappointment. I bought a more expensive one by SanDisk that works like a charm. It was pointless to spend $3 on this. I can see the price was reduced since I bought it. Maybe because you can treat this as a disposable one-time use type of a thing."
1,Worked for about two weeks,"I have TWO of these card readers. They worked fine for a few weeks and then stopped. One of them I got to limp through for awhile by pushing it just so against the USB slot in the computer, but then it stopped. It wasn't a problem with the computer or the cards because I tested them both with a coworkers card reader. These are junk."
1,Mine doesn't work,"I just received my memory card reader and it does not work - it is VERY slow in opening the file folder and recognizing the files, and then I could not copy / paste the files - I receive error messages. I have had memory card readers before - in fact, I also have a couple from ChiTek and one from Zeikos and they work just great - very fast."
1,Defective,"The product I received was defective. It didn't work at all. It may have been a fluke because, overall, this product received very positive reviews from others. Since it only cost a few bucks, I didn't bother returning it. I purchased another brand from Walmart for $10, and it works great. Realize that you get what you pay for, and the quality control on this product may not be the greatest, but for $3 you can make up your own mind."
5,"Low cost, gets the job done","I purchased this along with an SD card so I could transfer some files over to my Wii. While I have only had the product a few days, I must say that it works fine and does exactly what it is supposed to do. It does feel cheaply made but for the price, it can not be beat. I will update this review in the future if necessary."
1,Misleading description,I was looking for a micro card reader. This was part of the description but the unit does not support the task I bought the unit for. The only reason they got on star is because it arrived promptly. For the price not worth returning but would not likely buy from this supplier.
2,this item does not work with HD type memory,"I didn't know my cameras memory was HD. I got the chip a couple of years ago at Best Buy.So when I tried the reader with my cameras memory, it didn't work correctly.The vendor was excellent and refunded my money.So if you are considering this memory card reader be certain it is compatible.I was really impressed with this vendor"
3,handy like thing,It may have 10in1 but I don't thing I can find that many in it but I just need one size. I thought it had a micro mini slot for that type of card but it don't oh well. for the money it's fine
1,Poor Service,I never received the item.I emailed the sender and did not get a response back.i stol have not received the item. Please assist me if you can. thank you.
1,Doesn't work with Mac OS X,"This reader DELETES the files instead of DISPLAYING them on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard and Lion). The hardware seems OK, but I guess the firmware (at least for Mac) is incompatible. -- written in July 2012"
1,Does Not Work!,"Got this product in time. It doesn't work.After inserting this USB card reader in the computer, it took a long time to get detected and then later, it could not read the memory card."
4,Great Product,"Windows picked it up very quickly, works great, I use it often. I would but another, if need be."
2,Did not work on my Macbook,"I ordered this from one of the sellers on Amazon. First they sent me a different brand. I emailed them to say I did not want a Zeikos because I had problems with that brand before. They said it was actually better than the one pictured but they would replace it, which they did promptly. Unfortunately, the replacement did not work at all. I emailed the seller (Best Stop Electronics) again and they replied that these are not Mac compatible. This was a surprise because the description does not say that."
3,Does what it's supposed to,"The product works, but could use at least one improvement:There is no clip to keep the USB and SD covers on, I have already lost the one for the USB end."
5,Great!,"My Kodak camera has an SD card to hold the memory. I can't plug my SD into the computer normally. They wanted me to hook up my camera to the computer w/ a USB cable from my camera to the computer. It then opens up the ""helpful"" software that the camera comes with so I can upload them to my PC and be able to use a bunch of other useless, not working features. The Kodak ""Easy"" Share software is a bit annoying and slow. Plus, it always crashes and requires administrative privileges. Using this makes uploading my photos so much easier. Now, I don't mind using my camera. The device is extremely simple and works perfectly. I am so happy I bought it. It's also built pretty strong (worked fine after I dropped it). At <$2, this thing is a steal! I would strongly recommend it!"
3,ok for this value,this is my third one. Other two stopped working in 6-8 months. Buts still a good product at this value
3,Confusion,"I had problems with courier, I can't received the item.Amazon refund my money, but I won't trust in USPS anymore.It was a personal experience for that reason I cannot tell you more about the seller."
2,Not durable,"I bought two of them. Neither of them can read my 4GB SD card which is a little broken in one corner. However my old card reader can handle that. These card readers can still read my microSD card(with adapter), that was one reason why I didn't return them while the other one was the price. Then a month later, one of the readers died. I would not recommend this item to you. Stay away and stay out of trouble. Because of its low price, I didn't rank it one star -- that's the only reason."
2,"Works Fine, Until it Doesn't","I don't know why some reviews here are saying this reader is not Plug-and-Play; it is. In fact, it worked incredibly well, and at good speeds, when I first got it. The design isn't that sturdy, and the indicator light can get annoying, but I was extremely impressed at how well it worked for something that cost less than $2.But then, after owning it for about 2 months, it just stopped working. That's it. No gradual death, no physical damage. It just stopped, 100% dead.So if you are really pressed for cash and you need a cheap reader for only your IMMEDIATE needs, then go for it. But if you want something that lasts more than a couple months, stay away from this one."
2,Worked fine.....for one week,"I bought two of these from Amazon, at a cheap price yes, but only wanted them to transfer photos from the camera to the computer about twice a week. One got ""stuck"" in the slot and broke apart after three uses.The other ""almost"" did the same thing, in a different USB slot, but I carefully, based upon my experience with the first one, slowly worked it out of the slot. It was still loosely holding together, but I picked up an HP memory card writer/reader at Office Depot to use instead.I liked the design, color, and data transfer of this item, but the assembly, and materials of this product are sub-standard."
2,Doesn't work!,Does not work to upload photos onto the computer. It was so cheap so I suppose it doesn't matter.
3,The Prduct was less then Useful,I din't work for what I needed it to and which the seller told me it could do.
1,Not as advertised,"Did not work on the Pro Duo memory card that it claimed and that I purchased it for, so needless to say I was discontent!!"
3,Works Good,"We bought four of these on three different orders; only one was non-functional. But hey, for the price, they're pretty much disposable, right? Anyway, the ones that do work are very good. I use mine regularly to get pictures from my camera to my PC. My wife uses hers to play music from her SD card in our van's stereo that has a USB input. I'd buy it again, but understanding the risk."
1,failed reader,"Though initially a very handy device this card reader failed completely after a year of use.So...the low price was not such a bargain, as is always the case!5//11 - Good folk after all - contacted company & after a few email exchanges they sent me a new one,its working fine, hopeful that it will hold up in the long run."
5,Great Product,"I was a little skeptical about buying this because it was so cheap, but I love it and it works great!"
4,Gets the Job Done,"Just received 10 in 1 USB 2.0 memory card reader writer, Delivered fast, Gets the Job done, Honestly not much to look at kinda ugly... but oh well it does exactly what its supposed too! =]"
1,Indeed: worthless,"I gave away a similar device which worked fine, so bought this as a replacement. It does absolutely nothing: Amazon should discontinue sponsoring it."
5,Excellent for the money,This SD card reader has been working superbly with my SD cards of 2GB. An excellent purchase for the money.
5,Really enjoy this video,Was wanting to get into yoga and this video was on Netflix for a while. I enjoyed the video and ended up purchasing it. I'm not that knowledgeable about yoga but this video has helped me feel great.It starts slow with a warm-up and moves quickly into a really good workout. Then it takes you to a cool down and relaxation. It's great for me.Prepare to sweat.
4,Really underrated,"I would say this dvd is a great program, its a very good challenge for beginners. It holds poses longer wish increases strenght and stamina. The down side of this is that it really has virtually no inner yoga or really much of a spiritual practice in it."
3,"Good workout, but WAY too much talk","This is a great, challenging workout if you have just 45 minutes. But the more I do it, the more I get annoyed with how much he TALKS. He literally doesn't go two seconds without talking. It's distracting, and I'm pretty good about not being distracted during my practice. I think he just loves to hear himself talk, but it's too much. I wouldn't buy another dvd of his."
2,Not very interesting...,"Not that a yoga video has to be super entertaining...It just has to be interesting enough to keep me watching.There are a couple of nice challenging poses in this video -however, watching this trainer hover over the yoga models and give boring, vague instructions is just difficult to watch more than one time."
2,I know he is good but.......,"Yes Baron Batiste is a great teacher but I was very dissapointed with this Dvd, it has had many rave reviews however I found this dvd lacking in originality.I also found the adjustments and touching of his female yoga models unnecessary."
4,Pounding DeathMetal,When I first got this CD I slapped it into my cd player in my car. ON the first song I cranked it up all the way to get the full pound with my subs. I could not believe how hard this cd hits the whole way through. If you want to get some agression out get this cd and make sure the volume is up all the way. This is a must have for any DeathCore fan. Also get the first skinless album progression towards evil beacause it also will bash your brains in when listening to it. KILL KILL KILL
5,What can I say...,"I just recently bought this album and its just great. I didn't know about Skinless till a month before the release of Foreshadowing Our Demise, and the first song I heard was the Optimist and I was just blown away. Deep, dark growling in your face vocals and the instruments are fast passed, and just as hard and in your face you just can't compare these guys to anybody. I was glad to finally hear a death metal/black metal/grindcore (those are the things I've heard Skinless called)with true talent, not just some guys screaming and growling in the mic and calling it music. If your looking for some true metal to listen to I highly recommend you picking up this album but if you listen to Mall Metal (Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc.) don't bother."
2,lacks in many key areas,"ok these guys could have been soooooo much better. Really though, that can be said about many metal bands but in particular this band. there are a couple of cool songs but this sounds like recycled garbage. yes they are somewhat technical, but being technical doesn't make you a good musician.So what does this say about this album? Well if you have a alright metal catalogue then you'll hear the likes of Obituary, CC, and Six feet under on this album. no I am not comparing any of these bands to Skinless with the exception of SFU since they stink anyway. Production [is bad] as the dynamics on this album [is] also [bad]. the only real standout is their drummer and he's mediocre at best. so if you have that decent metal catalogue I was talking about, then you don't need this at all. I mean if you really want to know what they sound like, download any song, and you'll see what I mean"
1,It is like nothing I expected. This is boring.,"It's heavy, it's fast, it growls and shrieks. But is it origional? not really. it is all things i mentioned before but there is not one riff in the whole album or any arrangement of music that sticks in my mind and makes me want to listen to it again. When I listen to it, it only makes me want to listen to cephalic carnage or SYL. Because those bands do this kind of sound so much better. There is much better music than this."
1,Foreshadowing very generic Death Metal,"Oh man...I'll admit I had my doubts about Skinless, but when I first heard them today, was I right. I had expected some very mediocre Death metal, but this is just simply god-awful. This is very generic sounding. I would rank their [crudiness] up there with Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, and Deicide. The samples are the only thing I found entertaining about this band. I advise everyone to stay away from this band and go check out much better new band such as The Crown, Lock Up, and even the new Napalm Death."
5,BRUTAL Slamming death metal,"Skinless is a New York Death Metal band that combines the brutality and sickness of brutal death metal with the crushing breakdowns of New York Hardcore bands. Basically this band is like a combination of Suffocation (minus the extreme technicality) and Sworn Enemy. With that being said, this album KILLS! Right from the start this album grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. There intros are hilarious, and their breakdowns absolutely rule. You can not listen to this album without either headbanging or without getting the urge to start a mosh pit. I saw Skinless live with Six Feet Under and Sworn Enemy last summer and they put on an unbelievable live performance. Skinless is an unbelievable death metal band and I can't wait for their new CD. Listen to ""The Optimist"" and bang your head!!! N.Y.D.M."
5,Brutal DM with some good grooves....,"This release might be a rather disappointing release compared to PTE, but musically, this band has improved and even though they lost some of their raw brutal sound along with the lack of humor, there are a lot of killer grooves in their songs...A couple of songs are actually some really old material, but they are worth enough to give a blast, and actually, those songs are the funniest songs... So, even though this wouldn't be as enjoyable as PTE, GET IT!!! It's still a killer release!!!"
2,Still Waiting,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that I really like their first cd. I've listened to this a number of times, and have yet been unable to walk away with a melody that I can hum or whistle. The music is both sparse and dense at the same time, and I get confused as to what I should be listening for. It's like watching Shakespeare, when all the characters are played by Ben Stein. I'd like to endorse it as good chill out music, but the lack of melody really causes for a boring listen. Stick with their first disc everyone, and pray they hit the mark next time."
4,Amazing Young Talented Poet,"I can agree that Michael J. Burt will be a force to deal with in the poetry world! This book goes deep into life. I am a 46 year old woman from Atlanta, GA and I can relate to this book written by a 20 year old man from DC, what does that tell you? There are a lot of poems that are well written for instance ""Freedom Line,"" ""I Must Go On,"" ""Gamble,"" ""In Love with Stress,"" and others, Burt caught my eye with the poem ""What Is A Mother?"" This poem justifies what it actually is to be a mother, and distinquishes the difference between a woman taking care of a child, and a woman being a ""mother"" to that child. You should read this book. I gave it 4 stars because nothing in this world is perfect, but I highly recommend it!"
2,this book sucked,"I seldom dislike something this much. It seemed the more I read the less I liked. I have read books by excellent female authors, and some that left me gasping for air. Half way through this book I was convinced the book was written by a desperate woman pretending to be a man. It was an emotional roller coaster of drivel. I had to force myself to finish it. The author claimed initially the book received a scathing review, but after some time he had decided it was a good read. I'm certain the author has written books that were well received and popular, unfortunately this book isn't one of them. The title Incinerator seems a misnomer. This book should have been called Crash and Burn."
2,"Thorough, but turgid","An admirably thorough book greatly diminished in impact by an unbearably dull writing style. This is a book for academics rather laymen interested in Caesar. When one has recently read history written by someone such as AJP Taylor, it is impossible to read a book as plodding as Meier's 'Caesar'."
4,Highly recommend for history buffs.,"Although not for everyone I thought Meier did a thorough job on the life of Caesar and the late Republic. At times his writing seems a bit tedious and overwrought, but well worth the read. Meier digs deep into the forces that shaped Caesar and his conflict with the late republic. I enjoyed his frequent commentaries and extrapolations when all is not clear. I feel it helps one to think and form their own opinion on the events at hand. I highly recommend."
1,"A petty, disjointed perspective","The work is disjointed in sequence, petty in perspective, and is more interested in 'debunking' Julius Caesar than with delivering an informative and accurate account of events. A waste of money."
3,Caesar,"I don't remember buying this book/But I must have, because this is a review of it.I have several books on Caesar and Ancient Rome.joe"
4,The best work on Caesar,"Since the general content and merits of Meier's biography of the Great Julius Caesar have already been more than adequatley examined by previous reviewers, I shall only say that of the several recent works available, this is the finest.Of particular interest to the reader may be Meier's musings on the existance and nature of historical greatness in the early chapters.One of my few reservations is that the prose seems to have lost something in translation, rendering the early parts somewhat lacking in elegance."
1,very analytical - not too many info,The book doesnt contain much info about Ceasers life . It has so much analysis and theories that may or may not be true . I am dragging myself through the book . I dont think I will be able to even finish it
2,Missed opportunity,"Could have been a great book. But it isn't.The book is horribly edited and organized. You can mix and match chapter titles and content - makes no difference. The authors seem to ramble on about the same topic in each chapter. They seem to have broken most of their own rules with this book.I'm an ecommerce novice and I still found only a couple of info-nuggets. You're better off reading the author's blog (Grokdotcom), Seth Godin and Get Elastic blogs.The entire book is printed in rental-car-agreement-fine-print font. Annoying as hell. And the cover/dust jack art is creepy, so I threw out the cover. May be I'll give the book away to someone with a microscope.I know the authors are smart and respected. You can't tell from this book. Too bad."
2,Very disappointing,"A colleague recommended this book specifically because I've been working on improving the calls to action I create on client websites.This book has very little to do with creating these calls. The title is just a clever title. It is, instead, a basic instructional reference for people who are not very familiar with the marketing method.If you're new to marketing and you're working on website design, it's probably very good. It is well written and moves pretty quickly.If you've been working on websites but never took a marketing class, again, probably a great book introducing the principles that should be driving your work. A number of years ago I went back to school to fill in the theory behind the work I had been doing, and I found my marketing classes fascinating. This book may do some of that for you.But if you're a working professional and you have some educational background, it's pretty much useless."
2,This book was not what I expected.,"I am giving this book 2 stars because I thought it would be great, like Seth Godin or the Wizard of Ads books. I expected a book of ""Secret Formulas"" as the title says. Instead it felt like a well-written Website 101 book, 90% common sense plus a few good tips sprinkled in. No ""oh wow"" moments here. Big disappointment. Honestly, I kept reading page after page waiting for the meat, but it was just 2 pieces of bread."
4,Overall Very Good .... but,"A good book for anyone who markets online, BUT what was said in 300 pages could have been summed up in about 70. As soon as I saw that the writers had their own consulting firm and have a seminar coming soon, I understood that this book is going to be more like a grabber and in a way it was.Even though it gave few good ideas and something to think about for a person who has already been marketing online for over 3 years now, the purpose of this book was to get a reader all hyped up, energized, excited and call the author because it talks about how smart marketing online is important, BUT rarely gives you exact pointers you can use on Monday.I am glad I read this book, BUT I wish it was under 100 pages for what info it had."
4,Primer for Persuasive Writing,Should be in any online copywriter's arsenal. It's an all-in-one reference that's great no matter what the experience of the copywriter.
3,The chicken or the egg?,"Not sure which of the two books were written first, Persuasive Online Copywriting: How to Take Your Words to the Bank, or this one but this one contains a lot of the very same materials as covered in the former book. It is a great book for copywriting with the excpetion of the redundancy, assuming it is not a second edition (not likely with differing titles) or a re-write."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book as the potential to be a good book, but it forgot the call to action. There are no secret formulas."
3,Worthy But Kind of a Jumbled Mess,"This book is a compilation of articles written over the years and it shows. There is no narrative structure, typos are frequent and some sections seem forced. Concrete samples are lacking and the few screen shots they have contain no clear captions or indications of what I should be focusing on. If the authors would have written this book with the same focus and discipline as they give their clients websites, it would have been an amazing book...rather than mearly decent.PS. The type in the book is microscopic. For those of us pushing 40, this is a tad annoying."
4,always test your changes,"The book is for commercial website developers. It offers numerous suggestions on improving sales on your site. Mostly, it deals with B2C sites targeting a mass audience. Though the authors also say that it applies to more complex B2B sites.Perhaps the best advice is simply to methodically deconstruct your visitors' pathways through your site. When you change a page or series of steps, it is imperative to quantify this effect on a sample of visitors. eBay and Amazon are justly renowned for this experimentally rigorous approach. So too should you aspire. It gives you a tangible feedback loop within which you can test hypotheses.The authors also have other useful guidelines. Notably, and simply, to write well the text of your web pages. Hard to argue with that. But testing is the most important idea of the book."
2,A little ecclectic,"This is not a really good CD, though there are some fine moments e.g. in track 1. But then, if it comes to track 4: To name a piece ""Folklore"" does not justify the most banal phrases. 7.and 11. are overambitious pseudo-chamber music pieces, the melodies too trivial to need/bear an arrangement for string quartett. 8. is a pointless exercise in counterpoint. 9. plays with funk but doesn't spark..."
1,I have still not received this book. I feel cheated.,"I ordered this book a long time ago, and was promised delivery before the end of the month.It still has not arrived. Why?"
4,"A bit dated, but still relevant","Jerry's Charge Account is a charming book with appeal for both boys and girls.Unlike many of the popular novels of recent years, Jerry's Charge Account does not deal with dead mothers, post-apocalyptic scenarios, depressing living situations OR fantasy and magic. I remember feeling a great kinship with Jerry and his worries way back when I first read this book. Its real, it true, its funny and underneath all that there are some valuable concepts about money management and honesty.I think Jerry's Charge Account should be resurrected for late primary/early middle school readers."
4,Excelente Tecnica Descriptiva con Habilidad y Vocabulario,"Jose Saramago da sin duda alguna una muestra de su habilidad descriptiva a la misma vez que nos presenta un vocabulario extenso y bien planteado. Es especial la forma en que cambia de tercera persona a primera persona y viceversa, dandole un toque genial a su redaccion."
2,GOOD PROTECTION - VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,THIS WRAP IS GOOD FOR PROTECTING YOUR PAD ON THE TRAIL OR IN ROUTE TO. THE PACKING AREA IS FUNCTIONAL BUT TERRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE NO MATTER WHAT YOU STUFF IN THERE. YOU ARE BETTER OFF NOT HAVING A PILLOW. OR USING STUFFING MATERIAL OUTSIDE WRAP. I HOODY FITS GREAT BUT IS MORE COMFORTABLE JUST ROLLED UP OUTSIDE THE WRAP. THE WRAP KEEPS IT TOO TIGHT LIKE YOU ARE SLEEPING ON A BRICK. WORTH THE MONEY JUST HAVING SOMETHING TO PROTECT AND CONTAIN PAD THOUGH.
2,Big label change = Sell-out,"Man oh man, what was once a great band has just done the unthinkable, they've gone and went commercial. I was hoping this wouldn't happen but when I heard last year that they'd start touring with their friend Dierks Bentley, who's nothing more than a golden boy in Nashville, my radar went up. Well, it's happened. I realize these Texas artists are getting noticed, but it blows me away that they go and change their sound so much to appeal to the mainstream. Randy Rogers was one of the better new outfits to come out in years, and it's a shame that this puppy sounds like a hundred other CMT acts out there. You can try and justify all you want, but this is not the same sound as they had before; this is fabricated assembly-line music. People may not like the negative reviews, but too bad. If the truth hurts, so be it."
2,"Well, I *tried* to like it...","I absolutely loved Randy Rogers' earlier stuff. It was raw and danceable (yup, honky-tonks, y'all!), and his voice has a great growl that lent itself perfectly to the songs he *used* to do. He's also terrific live. Unfortunately, this album sounds like the generic mush Nashvill-wood churns out on a daily basis. I'm really glad the band is getting attention, but they SO need to go back to the ""old"" sound."
4,randy Rogers----wow!!!!,"If you don't sing along with ""Better Off Wrong"" and ""One More Goodbye"", you ain't got no soul.....Randy Rogers is incredible, and extremely underrated."
5,Fantastic!,"I stumbled onto RRB through pandora.com and have just been absolutely thrilled. After hearing songs from both Rollercoaster and Just A Matter of Time, I bought both CD's and love them both from beginning to end. As far as the Radney Foster influence, well, I don't know a single Radney Foster song. What's the deal here? It seems people are getting caught up in what they expected the album to be and the fear of what it wouldn't be instead of appreciating what it is."
5,Excellent Tiny Camera,"The picture quality is unreal, the features for this size are excellent, the complaints by the other person are wrong. All the rave reviews cover it so let me add my two cents. Only downsides, well designed power button is small to avoid it powering up but if you have huge fingers its small. If you travel you have to take the cradle with you to charge the battery, no direct AC connection to the camera. Of course buy a 256mg SD card for real use storage. The USA version does NOT do a 60 second movie, if you want that feature, you have to buy the international version. ONLY camera I know that does split screen double exposures. Lots of Excellent features.Overall this is an excellent camera that does not suffer from focus lag and is super easy to use, unlike a lot of other vendors the camera interface is excellent and intuitive."
4,One star lost for Movie Capturing,"I am not going to talk technical & features, other reviews covered most aspects.I think it's helpful to mention that I contacted Casio directly re the support of .avi file format (movies) in the Z4U version (US version), and I was informed that a law suit filed in the USA prevented them from shipping the camera with that feature within the states, and that they may offer free firmware update online when the case is closed so that EX-Z4U supports avi's. For those who wonder, EX-Z4U is exactly the same EX-Z4 without the movie support, therefore, if you were able to get your hands on a Z4, then go for it.I also purchased a SanDisk 512MB SD card which gave me the liberty of shooting photo as much as I needed without the fear of running out of memory.Both are great gadgets, I'm going to add the fifth star when Casio fulfills the promise and offers the software update"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this camera, despite all the reviews, for some stupid reason. This must be one of the worst cameras I have used. I figured the quality would be decreased by a little bit because of the size, but MAN! My 1.3 megapixel built-in digital camera in my VIDEO CAMERA takes better pictures than this camera in most situations. That's the thing about this camera, if your lighting isn't perfect, your shot will turn out like crap. This is due to the excessive digital noise in the picture. I bought this camera yesterday and took it back today because i knew that this camera would be a waste of money and a bad investment. If you want a camera that is about as small as this one with the same or better features, buy the Canon PowerShot S410 Digital ELPH. For forty dollars more and a 32 mb compact flash card, it is a much better deal for only about forty dollars more. If you do, you'll be MUCH happier."
3,Great camera terrible picturess,"Just bought the Z40 model here in the UK, and did my market research afterward rather than before. I decided that on balance for my girlfriends needs that I had probably bought the best camera for the job, and although I find it just a bit too small to hold properly, Girlfriend loves it and it is impressive in almost every important area except that all our pictures are terribly out of focus in a circular region all around the image. It's nowhere near as good as our old Kodak 2MP Camera for image sharpness and so dissapointing we are taking it straight back to the store. It's like a great big blur filter has been applied by some retouching software, only it hasn't. I took a shot in the shop when I bought it and when we printed it out at home it shows the problem superbly. It's completely unacceptable, and I can't believe people would put up with it. Perhaps it's faulty. Probably will go for a Cannon, or anything with bigger better optics."
3,It's not soo great..at least not what i expected..,"I bought this camera like a week ago and I wasn't quite satisfied with quality when i started using it. I had a fujifilm FinePix2600 2.0 megapixel and I even think the quality of that camera was better than this one. Maybe it's cause, the smaller the camera, the worse the resolution. I don't know. For those of you that are expecting to get your money worth, this camera is not for you. Go get a canon or a sony one if you're going to spend 399 for a 4.0. Sony has a lot of 5.0 that's even cheaper than this camera. (the cheapest one i saw was like 330 for a 5.0 megapixel sony camera) Canon is more expensive but a lot better. I recommend Canon."
2,Exposing the cheese,"I have read mixed reviews about this camera. Most reviews say this camera is not all that great. I tend to agree. I think Dawn Cahill's review from New York, New York is questionable. She probably works for Casio. Her review reads like a tv commercial script."
4,Good but not a good as expected,"i've had this since it came out. i like the sleek design but i'm disappointed that ths US version doesn't come with the movie recording feature. Its somewaht disappointing if you pay ~$400 for a camera.also i miss my sony U-20, a 2.0 meg point and shoot. the ease of that camera was great. with this casio, you have to pic the setting (like portrait, night scene, scenic, ect) you want to take pictures. its just too complicated when you have like 20 choices! i just want to point and shoot and get a good quality pic."
1,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,I bought this camera 3 months ago and since then i have kept it indoors. Despite the minimum usage this camera had undergone it broke TWICE! the second time i was informed by the service technicians that the lenses were broken and had to be replaced - i had to pay additionally 300 Euros !!!!!!!Stay away from this junk!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Don't buy this camera - go with the Canon S400,"I've owned many digital cameras. I keep upgrading. I had a Canon S230 (3 megapixels) - awesome image quality - the only thing I didn't like was the 2 x zoom. Saw the Casio EX-Z4U and purchased it 2 days ago. Excellent view screen, relatively easy control buttons, awful images. Everything comes out blue. Had to double enhance all the images on my MAC and through Adobe Photoshops. The whole point of a subcompact point and shoot is to be able to get out there, take the photos, and then be able to print or email with no additional steps.For a 4 megapixel camera this was a real disappointment. I'm returning it tommorrow and buying the S400 by Canon."
2,Lack of AVI mode for the US only,"I was disappointed to find that the US model of the Exilim Z4U camera has fewer features then the foreign model. Mainly the movie feature is missing. I contacted Casio to find what was up and if an upgrade would be available. After contacting Casio I received the following reply.Well basically You need the EX-Z4 ( one without the ""U""). This one is not officially released in the US by Casio IncDo an internet search for the model which should take you to international store that sells themThere is no info available on a future ""fix""Don't buy the US model."
5,Wonderful Camera,"i wanted a camera that fit into my budget. The seller worked out a deal with me and I was able to get this great camera. It works wonderfully and I use it all the time. It also has video. The only compliant I have about this camera is that it doesn't have a microphone so the videos have no sound. But other than that, it's perfect."
3,ex Z-4U Not all it could be.......,"Things to like about this small camera are the many feautures, the large LCD screen and battery life, docking station is a plus for ease of use. BUT, the camera has problems with color balance in most modes, flash shots come out weak and with a blue tint over the full frame.. Color saturation is not up to a Cannon or a Nikon by any means of viewing, including the finished print. As an outdoor snapshot point and aim its fine, but look at Cannon or Fuji (VALUE) FOR A BETTER DEAL in the $300 price range."
3,Disappointing Picture Quality,"I just got my new CASIO digital camera last night. I was so excited. After conducting lots of research, I chose this model because of its small size, sleek design and ..hey.. 4 M pixels..! The price was competitive too. The design, menu options, ease to use, large 2'' screen are all very impressive. However, I was so disappointed with the picture quality. You cannot imagine! I don't know how the advertise 4 M Pixels...I don't see them anywhere. At the begining I thought it was just the screen, but when I transferred the pictures to the computer, the quality was still poor. Bottom line: I AM RETURNING THE CAMERA TODAY. Casio has never been known for building quality cameras. They still have a long way to go.... I am going back to the traditional: CANON."
2,Wonderful poems done wrong.,"To keep it short and sweet, some of Neruda's best work is featured in this collection, but the translations are terrible, I mean downright despicable. My suggestion is to find this in a bookstore, go through the table of contents and buy each volume mentioned rather than buy this anthology. Belitt's translations destroy Neruda's beautiful imagery and the liberties he takes are often inexplicable. The sequence of the images is usually changed in the translations and individual images or concepts are sometimes excised or altered beyond recognition. At their best these translations are annoying, at their worst they are infuriating. I rated this book two stars because it still contains the Spanish versions of the poems, but that is the only aspect that kept it from receiving one."
3,What A Bargain,"No, this is not the long awaited digital release of Vinton's famed 1962 album of the same name. But it's nice just the same. Featuring four number one hits would normally get an album a higher ranking, but all four, (""Roses"",""Velvet"", ""Lonely"", and ""There"")are widely available so why do we need to have them on yet another package? It would have made so much more sense for Epic to delve into its deep vault of vintage Vinton vinyl and treat us to more gems, but Epic doesn't make enough of an effort here. The five songs that do appear here for the first time are more than worth the price however. ""Traces"" is no match for Dennis Yost but its a pleasant listen. ""When I Fall In Love"" is great with Vinton at his smooth best. Overall a great value but a release of the original ""Roses Are Red"" would have been oh so much sweeter. Epic take note!"
5,"An excellent history not only of Wells, but of the times.","I came away from this book with new respect for Wells, and her courage. I was overwhelmed with sadness after reading some of the details of the lynchings and the effect on the survivors. The book contains an excellent analysis of the real reason for many lynchings:economic competition."
4,Traveling Smorgasbord,"Prime Time Emeril is a treat to the taste buds, and a traveling smorgasbord offering page after page of adventurous dining. What I liked best about this book is the introduction to each recipe giving some background information about the dish itself, but also reveals a part of Emeril as a man and a chef. The intros made me feel like Emeril is more real and more approachable than most chefs of his stature. It's a worthwhile book to own and it made a lovely present to me from my husband. Cynthia Briggs, Cookbook AuthorPork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and ReflectionsandSweet Apple Temptations"
5,BAM!,"As a huge Emeril fan.I got this book for easter.It is a really nice book and alot of great things to cook. I made some creole season(or essance)and had a blast going ""BAM"". its a must get book if you are a fan of Emeril and or his show"
3,Too Much Seafood,"I bought this book for my husband as a gift because he is an Emeril fan. Unfortunately, we have not been compelled to try any recipes because none truly appealed to us. I also thought that the recipes would be a little less complicated than they were. Emeril really makes things look simpler on TV."
1,bad buy,after one use the non stick teflon started to peel off in big pieces an absolute waste of money
1,Do not buy this wok,"I received this in Christmas, the 2nd time I cooked pork chop with it (the type with bones attached), I washed it right after I cooked the food, scratches were found. I never used any utensils to scratch it. I couldn't believe any wok would easily scratch like this one. It's a piece of junk. The bonus bamboo streamer is useless really. The only thing in that set I think is the most reliable is the bamboo spatula."
1,Non-Stick coating came off before i even added the chicken,"So, two minutes of preheating with oil for a stirfry on meidum-high heat and a small explosion and fire started, then once the flames were out and the billows of smoke cleared, the non-stick coating poured off. Not peeled, but POURED off Bad product. I bought a wok for stir-fry which requires a hot wok. I have used many woks at much higher temperatures, and never had this kind of experience. They were a much higher quality, but I would not expect this kind of reaction even if I paid $10 for it rather than the $30 paid.Avoid at all costs. This product is dangerous."
1,What we have learned about making poor arguement,"If you want to learn how to make broad vacuous claims then this book is for you. The argument made by this author about science were without substance or logic. He goes so far as to claim that the very content of science is a social product. If you think that this is true then go read the book, you deserve it."
1,Panasonic Loses DVD Format War,I bought the E30 and am very disappointed. A technology like this is so promising. The DVD RAM disc cannot be played on any other player except this machine or a machine that can read DVD RAM. Most DVD players do not have this capability. DVD-R cannot be recorded again once the disk is finalized which limits its usage as a substitute for a VCR. I will be be returning it and purchasing a Philips which supports DVD+R and +RW which delivers on the magic of DVD recording.
1,Not enough detail or information,I agree with the reviewers who say this book is less than complete. Very sketchy descriptions. Fromer's guide is MUCH BETTER.
4,Great product,With the HD Cable input we get a totally new experience watching TV with our new Panasonic 53Wx42 TV. The DVD viewing is even better. I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of purchasing a wide screen TV to consider this product - it is absolutely worth it for the money (we paid $1200 at Costco) without having to send a few thousand more for a plasma or an LCD of the same size. Would be nice if it came with a screen protector.
4,displeased,I bought this item. I was told two weeks for delivery. After more than a month I was told they didn't have and couldn't get the product. Shame on Amazon.com for offering a product they don't even have!!!!!!!!!!A friend has the product and it is wonderfull.
1,Self-serving...again!,Lant continues to try to use authoring as a way to market his prodcts. Does not truly help the person looking to build their business on the web.Not recommended!
1,Very disappointing,This book does not come close to living up to its title. It is mostly advertising for Lant's products and services.
3,Spanish Grammar Workbook,"The book itself was in good condition and received in a timely manner. That said, It was not exactly what I was searching for. I wanted a more generic grammar book and this one is specifically designed to be used with its parent text. As a student who has been struggling with the grammar of the Spanish language it was not a very good fit. Would have liked to have seen a more in-depth description of the merchandise. I probably would have opted for some other book."
2,too thick and time consuming to roll up,too bulky and takes too long to roll up. i'd rather it be made of a lighter material and fold or roll up easier.
4,Waldorf Sophistication,"I was at Daryl Sherman's last date in 2008 when the Waldorf Astoria foolishly canceled her job at the Terrace Lounge. If you ever want to recall or imagine a romantic time in Manhattan, keep Daryl Sherman with you."
5,Super book,"This book provides an entertaining look at the Negro Leagues and the years prior, when blacks were banned by the ""Gentlemen's Aggreement"" from participating in the national past time. Although not a comprehensive study, it does provide the reader with a glimpse of what the Negro Leagues were like. One is left with a whole series of ""What might have been?"" to ponder. Overall, a great book and well worth the price."
4,Learned a lot,I found this book to be very informative. I knew hardly nothing about the Negroe Leagues before reading this. A couple of my students used some of the material for their projects. They were very interested. Great read.
5,Great book,My great-great uncle is listed in this book and I found it to be a significant piece of history for my family and me.
2,Only the Ball Was White,"The book is on a a fascinating subject but is poorly organized and tedious beyond belief. Way too much detail about long ago games and leagues, and less analysis, background or even interesting anecdotes. I had hoped to be able to use the book for a history class, but this won't do."
3,A seminal work in a crucial field.,This work will be a standard in the field for decades to come. Masterful.
1,What planet is he from?,"I must admit that I haven't read much of this book. I simply couldn't. I was offended by nearly every sentence. As an anthropologist, the subject of this book's second chapter is familiar to me; therefore, I was painfully aware that none of the author's sweeping, racist generalizations is even partially accurate. It was almost surreal to realize that this book was published by a well known academic publisher. Encountering this travesty of scholarship made me wonder whether interdisciplinary work is in fact even possible."
1,"Terrible DVD, Ok film","Cheaply packaged, poorly transferred film put together by someone taking advantage of the fact that this film is in the public domain. The soundtrack drops out frequently and frames are missing all the way through. It's often impossible to hear the dialogue. I give it one star as this is an otherwise near-impossible film to find, but this is a really awful DVD."
1,Reign of Pain,"Ashley's new CD really is a ""Reign of Pain."" I found the lyrics to be trite, the voice to be weak, and the CD to be generally obnoxious."
5,pure joy,"the musician swings, enrico feels his music, and you feel with him. His fast moving pace as his fingers moves swiftly along the keyboard, a light touch yet full of rythmn. He creates a captivating audience, designed to command your direct attention as he makes music what it is, music worth listening to. a great album...."
4,Given the material how could it miss?,"Enrico Pieranunzi is one of Italy's top pianists.Here joined by bassist Hein Van De Geyn and drummer Hans Vanoosterhout they play the Shorter songbook with sensitivity and depth.True Pierununzi isn't in his best working group (IMHO the one with Joey Baron and Marc Johnson like the Soul Note release ""Deep Down"") and he may have a sound that digs as deep as some but this is a fine CD with terrific SACD sound.Can't say I have enjoyed all of his original material (some is great some not so) but this is an homage piece that works.Check out Jazz Foundation Of America as I always ad.They are the ones who help the known and unknown in this art we love.PeaceChazz"
3,Concerns and Joys of Owning Jack,"Jack, a playful black and white dog that looks like a cross between a Jack Russell terrier and an anteater loves to hide his family's stuff in the closet, much to their dismay. Daily, Jack waits by the closet door to help them retrieve what might be misplaced. The family tries to correct Jack's errant ways by saying, ""No, no, Jack!"" But he continues hiding things until one day he hides a treasure that pleases all the family, especially Jack. This colorful book with bright acrylic artwork that moves the eye from left to right to the door will peak the curiosity of young readers from three to five years old as they try to guess what Jack might have placed in the closet. This chance to predict before lifting the flap to see will help the young reader pay attention to the text as well as the illustrations."
5,GET A GRIP ON YOUR GAMES....,"These little guys will do more for your controller pad than your little brothers will! It is a must have item for your pad...gives your thumbs super grips like denture on gums. If you find yourself losing your grip during an intense game that takes all your attention (like Geometry Wars), and one slip of the right or left thumb can lose your last life thus ending personal high score in the millions...whew. You'll be glad you didn't slip. Once you try and slip these on you'll never go back ""unprotected"".The only drawbacks to these is that it tends to wear out fairly fast depending on how much you play. Once it wears out, it gets easier for the rubber to weaken and rip...which means you have to replace them with new ones....which runs about $5 for a pair of these. Other than, that...it is well worth the grip!"
5,The Best is what Best Blackjack is!,"A word to the wise is in order. If you want to really play the very best blackjack against the casino that you can, then get this book. It has helped me tremendously and I am finally winning the majority of my sessions. It is also a lot of fun to read."
5,When to Fold When to Hold When to Hide,"Scoblete is a very good writer. He shows you exactly what games to play and how to play them. The book is just great and since reading it I have had a positive expectation at blackjack. If you want to win and want a book that really shows you the is and outs of how to play, I recommend this book highly. I am ahead over 10K since reading the book and I am not that big a bettor!"
5,I Learned and I Won!,This book is just great because you can beat the casinos if you learn what the author is teaching. It is a good book for understanding what it's like to play in the casinos too. Mr. Scoblete explains the ideas in such a way that anyone can understand what to do at the blackjack tables. Great book. When I went to the casinos after reading it I found that I knew exactly what to doi with each hand in each situation. I even won some money.
5,Great Book for Players,"What I liked about this book was how Scoblete was able to make his points without resorting to a lot of formulas and graphs. He analyzes all the top blackjack card counting systems and then explains why he thinks the hi lo is the best. The book is a good course on basic strategy, card counting and some advanced methods of play such as ace locating.You will also find that Scoblete is not just a writer but a player and his experiences in the blackjack wars make great reading. I particularly enjoyed his chapters on ""The Million Dollar Bum"", ""The Ploppy from Hell"", and his blackjack diary at the end.If you want to learn how to play and how to beat blackjack then read this book. If you already know the technical stuff then read it for pleasure. You'll find a lot here to enjoy. When you finish this book you then should read John May's ""Get the Edge at Blackjack"" which I have also reviewed today."
2,Old hat -- same old same old,"Nothing new here. This is the same old stuff that has been written for 30 years about BJ. Absolutely nothing for the experienced card-counter. For the novice, some helpful advice, but the neophyte would be better served reading a book dedicated to cardcounting."
1,don't buy it!,"this book just talk about trash, and if u know just a little bit about blackjack. then u know this book is useless. So don't waste your money!"
4,Good reading,"Even if you do not plan to be an expert player, this book is very interesting and enjoyable. You'll learn about the methods and the players. If you are serious about the game, you may have a slight edge (in The Netherlands for example you cannot count the cards and it limits the counting techniques you can apply) but do not expect making big money, and even less a living out the different methods (to say it otherwise you better have a ""normal"" job or write books about blackjack). It does not mean you cannot have fun"
5,Good for New Players and Pros Alike,"Frank Scoblete's ""Best Blackjack"" is a very comprehensive book that explores all you need to know to become a competent basic strategy and advantage player. Scoblete is a magnificent writer who can weave anecdotes and stories around the stratgeies so that the book is never dull or pedantic. I think players of all skill levels will find enough here to make the purchase of the book a very worthwhile expense. I think that anyone who goes to casinos and who has not read something by Frank Scoblete is missing out on a great experience."
4,Tregonsee saves the Galaxy,The new Lensman has to find himself inorder to save the Patrol. Doc Smith is smiling.
2,Bad,The game is OK. Now your thinking i'm a retard since I gave it 2 and said it was OK. It is OK and the reason I gave it 2 was because it was slow with choppy graphics.Fun:B-Graphics: D+Excitement: BLandscape: COverall: DI don't recomend it
1,It's Crap,The game has some really cool porches in it. But the grapichs and steering suck.I recommend not buying it.
3,One of the best books ive ever curled up too,"This is a wonderful book. Its obvious from the format and descriptions that much thought and imagination was put in to this book. I've read it many times and right now, it is a dog-eared version of the new.My only complaint is that my copy had a few pages not done correctly, in fact right in the middle they gave me 8 chapters from the 1st book.otherwise, I, personally, would give it 5"
5,Tuckets Travels,The Tucket books like all of Gary Paulson's books are so much fun to read. The best part for me is that they are good to share with my grandchildren and they don't have to be read by just one age group they are great adventures at any age. Mr. Paulson must do a lot of research too as they stand up to the times he places them in. Wonderful reads!
5,All 5 books in one - great series,"I didn't read the description very well. This is all 5 books in one. So don't buy them individually! Great boys series, you sons will love them!"
5,A Retractable Red Ballpoint Pen That Really Writes!,"This is the first Retractable Red Ink Ballpoint pen that writes smoothly right out of the box, and continuosly puts the ink on the paper without skipping and smearing. I can't count how many retractable red ink pens I've tried, from the cheap to the expensive, from the unknown to the name brand, none of them worked right!This is a retractable red ink fine point pen that does NOT skip, does NOT soak, does NOT leak, does NOT smear and you DO NOT have to scribble with it to get the ink to flow. It works just the way you want it to, a reliable smooth rolling ballpoint pen which fits nicely in the hand. With the fine point, I can print/write in small detail which is clear to read without the ink smearing and closing in on the letters. This pen is well designed and it has that feel to it as you use it."
2,okay,"this pen was not what I expected, fine point. I would rate it closer to medium. It is okay for an everyday pen, but not if you have to write all day on a job like I do. Which was the reason I was looking for a fine point pen that was inexpensive. I usually use gel and it is not the same quality, no where close. I do not plan to buy any more."
5,Great Pen,I love these Pilot Easy Touch Retractable Ballpoint Pens. I love the way they write. I give them to people as gifts. Everyone loves them!
3,Great pen until the clip breaks,"I've tried this pen and the similarPilot G2 Gel Ink Roller Ball Pens, and I much prefer the Pilot G2. The ""EasyTouch Retractable"" works fine while it holds together, but I find the pocket clip breaks off quite easily (maybe I fiddle with it too much)."
5,Good,It is a very good pen with fine point.It is comfortable to hold and good for the price too.I recommend this product.
2,Writes great with poor durability.,The pen writes very smooth. It requires almost no down pressure to write. It is also pretty comfortable. There is one problem that I dislike. The clip to hold it at the edge of your pocket breaks extremely easily. I broke one clipping it into the pocket of my jeans. In one case the pen almost broke in half. I do not recommend this if you plan on using the clip.
1,This pen is blotting,"This is my first review of anything. I have been buying more on Amazon because I have a Prime membership and it is so easy to order. I may have gotten a little carried away buying a package of 12 pens I would not spend the money on trying to return.These pens are useless to me since my first pen is blotting after hardly any use. I prefer a fine point, am not fussy about blue or black, but a pen that blots is useless to me. I do not want to sign a letter or card only to have my pen blot. I do a fair amount of note taking and underlining in books and I do not want my pen to leave blots of ink.There did not seem to be an option to give no stars, but since I do not plan to use any of the box of 12 pens I just bought, I cannot imagine why I would give them any stars at all.Do not buy these pens. I read the good reviews about them before I ordered, but my pen is leaving huge blots of ink."
2,just OK,Not really a fan of these pen. I thought it was the gel model...it turns out that just a basic pen
5,Great Pens,This product is a great value. They are my favorite ballpoint pens to use for the look of the writing and the feel of the pen.
5,Smooth,"I am not picky when it comes to pens but one day I borrowed this pen from my friend and I fell in love with it, so I came here looking for it and I ordered this pack. Very comfortable to use and thin."
5,Great book for AP English Literature courses,"WRITING ABOUT LITERATURE offers clear strategies for writing a variety of literary analysis essays. Many examples and step-by-step procedures to write a variety of essays such as: characterization, setting, metaphor and allegory, point of view, theme, imagery, and tone. An appendix at the back of the book provides samples of literature for students to use as resources for analysis including classic short stories, poems, and two plays. This 9th edition also includes a chapter explaining 10 critical approaches to literature."
4,Not a new book,"This book was in good condition, but I thought I was supposed to be getting a new book. Not a huge deal just wasn't what was advertised."
4,The Foreign Legion Picturebook!,"This book is a brief (66 page) book about the French Foreign Legion. It looks and reads more like a magazine, with tons of great photographs... plus inserts, fact sheets & the like. It doesn't go much into history (hence the title), but it does describe each regiment/unit. It also has information that I haven't seen anywhere else--on the Pioneers, for example. (There was no mention of the Pioneers anywhere in Douglas Porch's 600+ page ""The French Foreign Legion."") This book is a must-have for any Legion buff.Note that the information is a little dated. The French no longer perform nuclear testing, for example. After reading this book, you may want to join, but make sure to get current information first!"
4,Great book for pics!,"This is a good book only for the AWESOME PICTURES!!! There isn't much useful info, but who cares when you get some really cool & rare Legion pics!!!!"
2,Not what I expected.,"When I read the information for this album, it shows that it is a two disk set. When it arrived it had only one disk, and the disk I recieved had some tracks listed out of order. Not the best purchase I've made for sure."
1,So Disappointing,"The Acme juicer has a great vintage appeal and history that sold me on the machine. I read the reviews and there are good and bad. I thought if I read the manual, do what it says we wouldn't have the vibration-lid flying off-destruction and devastation. I was so wrong. The juicer is extremely sensitive to how veggies are added. If they are too soft, they ball up and create an unbalance. I clean the juicer at least 3 times while making approximately 16 oz of juice. This morning the vibration became so terrible the lid flew off, juice went everywhere. I unplugged the machine and grabbed it, cut my index finger. All that for what little juice came out. My husbands grandmother had an Acme juicer for many years. In fact, it is still in the family. Unfortunately, this one is going back to the seller."
2,What am I doing wrong ?,"I bought this juicer about one year ago after reading all the great reviews, used it for a few weeks and then got tired of it because after a few pushings of fruit or veggies or combined items (mostly apples and carrots) it becomes incredibly noisy and the whole juicer starts shaking, I clean it all out and start all over and then the same thing happens. I put it away for a few months and now started using it again as I do love the juice it makes but still have the same problem, what should I be doing differently ?"
1,Wouldn't buy it again!,"There are some major flaws in this machine. The first is that it is dangerous when it becomes unstable, which is frequent. The second is that it will only juice about a cup of juice before becoming unstable. When it becomes unstable the lid flies off and juice sprays everywhere. In order to get the amount of juice I want, I have to empty the centrifuge 3-4 times each morning. Iirritating to say the least. I did not buy it from amazon and the vendor is now gone, so I guess I am out of luck. There are so many other juicers out there, so don't buy this one. Make sure your juicer has some kind of pulp disposal system so you can just keep juicing!"
5,Fantastic juicer!,"This juicer does a wonderful job separating juice from pulp! It will quickly and efficiently juice carrots, radishes, beets, pineapple, apple, strawberries, kiwi, celery, etc.Pros: Quickly turns fruit and veggies into juice, relatively quiet, simple to clean when using a filter, many very good recipes available online.Cons: Can only make about 2 pints before the filter should be changed, can be difficult to clean if you do not use a filter."
3,"solid build, not hassle free","i've had my acme 5001 for years. i agree it is well-built and sturdy. my main complaint is the filter sheets. you have to use these filter sheets (which are bleached) on it. once they start getting covered with pulp, you get less juice out of the machine. so, if you are doing a lot of juicing at once, you'll have to change filters, or, it will be like a King of Queens comedy episode were Doug goes through a bag of fruit for a couple drops of juice. (i have been told you can juice without the sheets.) cleaning it is a hassle too. i do own the citris attachment. it works great, though big and bulky. the shoot is small also and you have to cut cup things like apples or larger veggies. also very hard to clean. i would look into better designed juicers as there are plenty to choose from."
1,disappointed,"Basically, I am disappointed at the price per the functioning of the juicer. It's difficult to clean, even with the tissue inserts which you need to purchase more of ""that is disappointing to have to purchase these extra"". On top of that it is very picky about what it likes to juice ""totally a scary event to juice cucumbers, as it gets incredibly loud, off balance and seems as though it wants to fly in the air."" I like to green juice and truly feel extremely disappointed and I wasted my money on this juicer. It's OK if you like to juice Carrot, apple and celery. I juiced at my friends house with a 100 buck Jack Elane. It works great, less expensive, and will juice anything I like with easy clean up and pleasurable experience. So I personally DO NOT recommend this juicer, extremely disappointing experience!"
1,6001 Juicerator,"I purchased my Acme Juicer 6001 about a month ago. This is my second Acme juicer. The first was purchased in 1975-76. When my son went off to college he took the juicer with him and still uses it regularly. When I wanted to buy a juicer I went to Acme expecting the same quaility as my original juicer. The juicer is unsafe and has on atleast 6 different times vibrated so hard the lid actually came loose and the whole juicer vibrated all over the counter top. Juice flying every where! The first time I used it the plunger top came loose from the stem and continues to do so during juicing. Has anyone else experienced the same? I have contacted the closest service center and I'm waiting to hear from them. My other concern is that I didn't receive any warrantee information with the juicer. I purchased it as ""new"" for $198.00. I hope I can get my money back!! BEWARE!!!!"
1,Can't give it ZERO stars!,We never had the pleasure of the burning smell because we couldn't even get it to turn on! It's going back today!
2,"Pop, Pop, Fizz Fizz","I bought the 4216 (platinum) in November and have had nothing but problems. Delivery driver unpacked TV only to power up with no picture. Amazon would not allow me to return TV and made me call Samsung for warranty repair. I would think twice about buying on-line for this reason. 1st warranty company came out to repair and had to take TV to shop and replace tuner. Returned TV and regular picture looked fine, but HDTV was blurred. 1st warranty company would not come out to adjust, so I had to call 2nd company and they came out and adjusted lines. It is now May and TV just popped and fizzed and now no sound or functionality. 3rd repair service in less than 6 months. I too heard Samsung had improved their products, but I do not see it. The picture is great when it is working, but for this $$$ I would go with the Mitsubishi if I could do it over again."
1,Samsung hcm4215wx 42,"I bought this T.V a couple of weeks ago and just received it on the December 13th. It was set up and running fine. The brightness and picture quality were great. The sound was also good. My problems with this Samsung started on day 4. The set just quit working, kaput, dead. Push the on switch and hear an electronic ""click"" and that is it. This is the same thing that happened to my other Samsung but it took 7 years before it died. I had heard that Samsung had improved their products, but my experiance says no they haven't. Good luck to those of you who have purchaced one of these T.V.'s but I'm returning mine and buying a Toshiba 42""."
3,"I like banana, but not necessarily like this...","I blend together a decaf Columbian coffee with caffeinated, flavored one. In the past it has been Hazelnut or French Vanilla, but not of this brand. I saw this particular one and thought I'd give it a go, especially since I love banana nut bread. This is one instance where you can take flavored coffee to far. Coffee, if flavored, should take on the smells and tastes of chocolate and similar flavors.I will be finishing off the order, but I won't be purchasing this flavor again."
4,Complete and fascinating,"As a student of Dr. Luc Beaudoin, I found that his work reflects his passion for the romantic period of Russian Literature. As is evident in the book, Luc is a master at analysis, going deep into the story, into the words, and into the meaning of the word, those obvious, and those not so obvious. His interest and thorough research very clearly shows through in this work, and the academic world is indeed lucky to have such a valuable resource as this book is."
1,Awfull product,"I have my Panasonic burner for about a year. Now it locks up everytime I want to erase a dvd-ram disk. Also, this unit is not compatible with most dvd-r disks!!! I had to throw away several packages of dvd-r's.Don't buy this thing, choose for Sony instead!Be warned..."
4,Great product,"I love my DMR-E30 Panasonic DVD recorder. I would have liked to buy one with built-in hard drive, but was cost prohibitive. Good buy for those who don't want to put out the extra money for the hard drive."
5,One of our Bestsellers!,"As the publisher for this book, I can honestly say as a small press publisher that this book written by Richelle Putnam is one of our bestsellers, as it continues to enlighten and bring inspiration to those who may have found themselves in the type of situation the main character found themselves in. Richelle Putnam is a caring individual who is an inspiration to all children and adults with regard to learning how to substitute a bad situation for a good one...."
2,read to much like a term paper not a story.,There was a lot of information in the book but it was all research from other magazine and newspaper articles. There was no NINE INCH NAILS in there just facts. I didn't find that to entertaining.
2,"Or, ""An Amalgam of Earlier Articles, Interviews, etc.""","I was disappointed in this book; it seemed to quote from nearly every earlier article on, or interview with, Trent/NIN. There were a few tidbits I'd not run across before (but I was unimpressed with those - memories from high school acquaintences, etc.). However, it may be informative to those who haven't been keeping up w/NIN since the early days, and it does attempt to place all the earlier info into a framework. I just felt that too much of the book was derived from others' work (e.g., ROLLING STONE, SPIN), and that it could've used a bit more original material."
1,Not so good...,"Nothing but recycled interview quotes, and not one instance of applied intelligence. Huxley appears to take everything Reznor says or anyone else says about him absolutely at face value, and makes no attempt at engaging the complexity of his work or his cultural position whatsoever. There's nothing shocking or evil in it, nothing that got me up on my hind legs, but what really disappoints me is that there is literaly nowhere (that I've encountered)where someone writes intelligently about this work. Huxley's book does nothing but cultify Trent's personality, and makes no attempt to approach his subject with anything but sensationalism. And nothing could be stupider than those captions under the photos."
2,Nine Inch Nails,"This book is a disappointing read for the average NIN fan - pretty much everything of interest in the book I had already read somewhere before (most online as they are from American magazines such as Spin). The author also pads out the book with information on other artists, some of whom have very little connection to either Reznor or NIN. This means the prose is sometimes more in line with that of an essay than an interesting book. I was excited to find and read this book given the lack of books on the subject but, ultimately, I was relieved to finish it."
1,A poor representation of a creative genius,"Unfortunatly, Martin Huxley poorly potrayed Industrial Rockstar Trent Reznor in his book ""Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct"". Huxley seemed to simply take exerpts from magazine interviews with Reznor and throw them into the pages of a book and call it a biography. I do not recommend that anyone buy this book, unless you would like to slowly and painfully kill yourself due to the extreme amounts of bordem that Huxley manages to include in this book."
3,A Biography? Maybe Not,"For those of you thinking this is a biography, it's not. That is it is more a collection of interviews that Trent has done throughout his career. Not that this is bad, if you can put up with ""Reznor told Guitar World"" or ""He pointed out to Musician Magazine"" throughout the book. Overall I think it was a good look into the world of Trent Reznor and certainly saves you a lot of money buying the magazines the original interviews are derived from."
3,Relied too much on interview clips,"I though this book relied too much on previously published interview segments. I had hoped it would have been a better study of Trent Reznor's career and music. I felt the book only skimmed the surface. Also, I had hoped it would have given more detail about NIN's videos (which I enjoy watching). It was too quick a read."
3,Does Not work with Progressive Scan DVD Player,It's a good TV with very bright and clear picture but unfortunately it does work with my Pioneer DV-434 Progressive Scan DVD Player when I turn on Progressive Scan.
3,Fitness and Wellness,the book over all is very easy to follow. It also very interesting. I seems a bit dated though it gets the job done.
1,Fitness & Wellness Book,"This book has all the lab pages missing. When I e-mailed the seller, he replied that he stated on the advertisement that the book is in very good condition and some pages are missing. No excuse, any college student should know that very good condition and missing pages don't go together. People like this are ruining the Amazon name; I don't trust purchasing from Amazon again. I had to go buy another book; it was either that or drop the class if I can't submit my assignments."
1,"Great, while it lasted...",Worked great for a couple of months but then it started shutting off too early and woule only perk the water through the coffee for a minute or less so instead of coffee it made brown water! The farberware percolator we had before this one lasted about 6 months but it died as well. I think we will switch back to a drip machine. Why is it that the 30+ year old corning percolator still works and that belonged to my grandmother. They really don't make some things like they used to I guess.
1,Waste of money,"Thermostat quit after 2 months, now I see other have had this problem. My old pot lasted 45 years, but this is useless.I guess I'll walk around the block and get a cup of coffee."
2,Lid Removal Problems,"This coffee perc makes wonderful tasting coffeee---much better than any of the drip machines we have owned. However, it has been a problem since we bought it, in that the lid is VERY DIFFICULT to remove. After a few months of tugging on it, the plastic tabs on the viewing knob on the top have sheared off. Delonghi, after going through a bit of red tape, has agreed to replace it (in warranty) but is charging me $7.50 shipping, which is kind of sand in the face in my book. They also admit that ""the sticking lid is a problem but it usually gets better with time."" I would not buy another one based on those poor assurances."
5,Excellent Story,"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop. I am definitely looking forward to the next one (SOON). Great Job!!!"
3,Difficult to use ...,"I had an old pair of regular pinking shears that no longer cut well so I was happy to see these lefty pinking shears. Unfortunately, they are very heavy and, therefore, rather difficult to use. However, unlike my old shears, they do cut!Would not, however, recommend these."
1,Junk,"I received these as a gift over a year ago and they never worked. Since then on and off I have been trying to contact the company to get a new pair, but have not received any response. I emailed them twice, got error messages when I sent messages through the website, and called them, but never spoke to a live person. Their website gives no information about how to return them even though they like to tout their lifetime guarantee. It is not worth the trouble to buy this product and have to return it."
5,Surprise!,"Lew Jetton and 61 South sound like they're fresh from New Orleans! Never would I have expected such depth and ""blues"" talent from Western Ky. In my opinion Lew can hold his own with the old masters. Best of luck in the future and any time now he can ""Give up the day job!!"""
2,ripoff to a HUGE fan,"I have diligently and faithfully bought Seasons 1-7. And I advise you keep your money....Season 8 of Girlfriends is a RIPOFF!!!!!!Thought for sure there would be at least one final episode that didn't air....well, to my disappointment there are only 2 disks and not a single additional episodes....for the same $28 as every other season. SAVE YOUR MONEY and have someone burn a copy of this mess. What an awful end to a fabulous series."
3,disappointed,"This was such an anticlamax. The story line was as usual very thought provoking and it was clear that had the show not been canceled, this would have been an excellent series like the others. Why would you cancel a show like this that brought so much pleasure and had such a wonderful future?"
5,Simply the best,"This entire series is fatastic. The writing is great, and the acting humorous with impecable timing. A classic in the making."
5,A nice gift for a good friend,"I really enjoyed reading this book. And I believe it makes people think about what ""sex"" actually is. It is also funny and very entertaining! Thanks"
2,"Not great, but not stinky","Given the glowing reviews of this book online, I purchased it sight unseen. However, upon reading it, I wasn't that impressed. Illustrations are fine, but not anything special. Story is the typical ""counting down"" scenario which kids love. The stinky diaper aspect is cute, but I was expecting a funnier twist to the story. No such luck.Not a stinker, but nothing fresh as a daisy here."
5,Ten Stinky Babies is a hit with my 19 month old!,"My 19 month old daughter loves this book, it is one of her favorites. We read the story to the melody of ""10 silly monkeys"". She picks this one out a lot for book reading time. She enjoys pointing the dog out on the different pages, and as anyone with a toddler knows - she LOVES babies!"
4,Makes me smile.....,"It is just a delightful book that anyone could share with a child. The illustrations and story are so true to life. A way to count with a child. I look forward to Ellen's next book. A collection for a grandmother's suitcase, I think."
1,Yeee-owch!,"Since I stubbornly refuse to stop reading a book no matter how bad it is, I suffered through the whole thing. Between the ridiculous premise that's completely unbelievable, the lousy writing style, and the lack of anything remotely resembling a plot, the book easily rates instant-dumpster status"
2,Crazy,"This book is absolutely, downright strange. The persona used to be a radio wave, and is friends with an American Indian who travels the galaxy in a bark canoe. They live on a freezing planet, called Candle, where a host of strange things occur. Despite this highly original story line, the book is ruined because it is written in a style that makes it close to impossible to comprehend. Major events occur with very little introduction and not much explanation. Most of the book seems to be the persona whining about one thing or another, or talking about some esoteric technology (not yet developed yet obviously) which leaves the reader 100% mystified."
1,seller shows blue face but it came to me with black face,my watch came to me with the wrong color face . it was black not blue as showen . it also came with no invoice or receipt and looked like it was throwen in the box from 10 feet away. very tackey!!! i will not order from motor city again.
5,This is a Fab prop for a photographer or to wear.,This watch is fantastic we use it in the studio as a prop its FANTASTIC in real life it looks great on photos its even better. a bargain 100% and its not a fake its the real thing. buy it you will love it.
5,great sclub is the bomb,this cd is awesome especially the video is the bomb alive is a really good song
1,step AWAY from the popcorn maker,"We received as a wedding gift one of these popcorn makers (sans the NFL licensing stuff). It looked fun to use, and adorable.Unfortunately, it seems to spit out (at high speeds) 3 hot kernels for every popped one. The opening is slanted, but still provides a gaping enough opening to to let many kernels escape parallel to the table.Only buy this if you don't plan to use it, or if you dislike the person you're giving it to. Otherwise, cute."
2,"Quality fine, price is horrible","These do exactly what they should, so no problem there. Unfortunately, the price each is the roughly the same as a package of five or more from other vendors through Amazon."
4,"Another ""must have"" book for a gumpaste enthusiast","As a professional cake decorator, I found Alan Dunn's new book a necessity in my library. His attention to detail and ability to instruct through writing makes the book a bargain. The book is open and in use more often than not."
1,If Fake is what your looking for you've found it.,I was hoping for a book that was about real cakes and flowers. What I found was a book where the flowers are made and the cakes look like something you would not eat. I have never seen a cake like this at a wedding. Not only that but the flowers are not pretty. If you are looking for a natural look then this book is not for you.
4,Lord Protector,"I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author proved to be quite knowledgeable of the War of the Roses, and his unique spin on that topic along with Roger's hopping five hundreds back and forth through the portal in Wales made for a fun read. I was pleased to discover that this is just the first adventure for the self-absorbed historian with his knack for getting himself into trouble! I'll be sure to purchase the rest of the trilogy to find out what happens next to Roger.Some of the points of interest were the author's attention to detail and fleshed out personalities given to his characters-well done!"
2,Not much information,"I like stewarts book 13 cubed, but this book don't have very much information in it. It has more symbols and color healing etc.. It's not that fun to read, although there are some interesting things of spiritual healing and prayer in the book. It's really not worth what you have to pay for it unless you get it for 5 bucks or so.--Nick"
1,Back it up,Disorganized text that includes everything from numerology to visualization but without a supporting rationale. The production values of the book are poor and the actual support information for the methodologies aren't listed. The use of higher dimensions as a support for healing aren't clearly defined in terms of mechanism of action. Worth reading as a curiosity but I'd prefer to see more support information for the books assertions.
4,A blast from the far gone past,"There is no one like Mitch Miller. You know every one of his songs -- they were the ones you learned in second grade music class, or in summer camp (but with unprintable words). Your mom and dad and grandparents know all the words to all the verses -- and somehow, when you hear the tune, you know the words too. This is the musical equivalent of comfort food. It is impossible to resist singing along, and is one of those recordings that is sure to make an appearance about the time the boring guests leave the party."
5,Fun,Very happy with all the songs. Those that know the songs can easily sing along as well as persons not familiar with but easily learned. Great for a family or other group participation.
5,Skillful,"Fantastic song that is well-written. The drummer works very hard! Also buy ""Stacked Actors"", their second single from the new album, ""There is Nothing Left to Lose""."
2,not same size,the replacement isn't the exact same size as the one I broke. It's loose when put in place. Still works though.
1,Poor Quality,"I've gone through two blender jars in two years, both have sprung leaks within a year of usage and required replacement."
1,Broke immediately,"Our original blender jar had one broken blade. We put up with a 3-blade blender for years before we finally invested in a new blender jar. We had it for a month or more before we actually used the new jar. I don't think it had even lasted 6 uses before the central screw of the assembly broke into two. We weren't doing anything unusual with it - sauces and smoothies. It's now completely useless, and past the time to return it. For the price, and supposedly ""professional"" quality, you'd think you'd get something that would last more than a week. Now we're out fifty bucks and still have a lousy blender."
2,"Pretty?, YES...Pretty durable?, NO",I have replaced this due to the original taking a fall into the sink and breaking (my fault). The Replacement unit blade assembly shaft broke while making the first batch of frozen drinks. I am done with the glass jar. Will try my luck with the S.S. version
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,I bought this replacement jar when I chipped the glass on my other one. The blade assembly fell apart while I was blending something (just as everyone else's has). I emailed the company and they asked what action I'd like to take next. Um... send me another one... that won't fall apart... is that too much to ask? They never emailed me back.
2,Lasted for 3 months,"I've had to order a couple of these over the past few years, this most recent one only lasted 3 months before it started leaking. It's used 2x day pretty consistently, for making smoothies with milk and frozen fruit (no ice.) I don't see a way to repair it myself. The blender is great, and the jar is great while it works. But for $50 it should last much longer. I've seen some of the other reviews and have ordered the stainless steel version in the hopes that it will be more durable."
5,Beautiful,"If you're trying to get into an Asian boy band, you can't go wrong with these fellas. This song is so gorgeous, both in full and acapella versions.Quick intro if you haven't met them; Xiah, Micky, Hero, Max, and Yunho. This is the first K-pop group I've gone fangirl on (the group originated in Korea, but has branched out into Japanese songs as well) and while I may be blinded by love, my ears are without taint and I urge you to give these guys a try."
1,SUPER BAD,"i received the shipment and the shot glasses are brokenthe packaging is very badi ordered shot glasses, i didn't order broken pieces of glasses"
1,NOT an adventure game!,"ADVENTURE gamers: do NOT buy this game! 1) It is a series of mazes; 2) 90% of the time you are either killing dead people or the living, and then rekilling them after they are dead; 3) in order to save at any point in the game, you must look around for a character (who moves around in the game), as there is no other way to save; 4) there are some inventory items; 5) it is a keyboard game (i.e., you have to use both hands to maneuver in the game; and, 6) if you insist upon getting this game, make sure you back off every time you kill somebody or you will end up not finishing the game! This game was a waste of my money."

This game was a waste of my money."
3,Okay but not as helpful as I'd hoped,"More for the woman who has been left than for the woman who leaves. And more of a personal pep-talk than a thoughtful study of marriage and divorce for the intellectually curious woman going through a divorce and looking for something with some meat to it, for whom I would instead recommend Against Love and The Meaning of Wife. But cheerful and a quick read nonetheless.Against Love: A PolemicThe Meaning of Wife: A Provocative Look at Women and Marriage in the Twenty-first Century"
5,Empowering women to celebrate their new life,"What is most interesting about his book is that it can serve as a practical guide not only to women post divorce, but also to those contemplating it. Through its honesty and wit, it empowers women to bravely journey forward, guided by the bright light at the end of the tunnel."
5,perfect guide to have in your pack,We spent a week visiting the Galapagos islands and found this handy guide perfect for identifying the birds and reptiles that we encountered. It's small enough to fit in your day pack and easy to use. I also liked the check lists in the back of the book. There is a good comparison of the Darwin finch beaks that was very helpful. This is the only guide that you will need with the exception of a fish guide if you snorkle.
2,Switcharoo edition,"Just so you know...* You originally clicked on the Turtleback edition (2006) from Yale University Press. You are looking at the Paperback edition (2001) from Yale University Press. If you add this book to your cart, you'll get the edition you originally clicked on.I clicked on the spiral bound book, but despite the above assurance from your website that I would get the original book I investigated, I got the paperback edition which does not fold open easily. The whole point of ordering the spiral edition was to be able to fold the book with viewed pages folded flat. My bad for not complaining---but the review made me go look again at the note."
5,Awesome book,One of the best books I have ever read.I love how Ed Cole has that in your face way of speaking to men.
1,only one side of the dvd played.,"Wouldn't buy another 4 title DVD if life depended on it. only one side played on both.Cheap quality, a rip off."
3,A basic review of the company,"The info is a little dated, a lot has happened in the lakes industry since it was written but it's a decent history for it's time. The photos are interesting. The text is pretty good, but it's a little hard to track down the information that centers on each Am Ship plant since it's all in chronological order, certain yards have their history spread through different parts of different chapters. Pretty good anyway."
1,"Cheap Coffee, No Banana Flavor","I purchased this coffee straight from their website. I bought the whole bean version. When I first opened the package, what greeted me was an artificial banana smell. Things didn't get much better after brewing a pot. I have a new name brand coffee maker, good quality water and filters. The result was an average cup of coffee with NO banana flavor whatsoever. I emailed the company to let them know about this problem. I got a response saying that this is not their first complaint and maybe someone from their company should try the coffee. Well, duh...I would think that for a product like this, there should be some kind of quality control.My advise--there are plenty of other great flavored coffees on Amazon. Skip New Orleans Coffee Exchange.Update: Never heard back from owner of the company. Poor customer service."
3,"Okay, but not great","I'm the absolute beginner that the book is targeted at, but as I am being self-taught, this book may not be the best option. It would be great if you have teacher leading you on, but if you're doing this by yourself, I suggest the Hal Leonard series that comes with the DVD/CD combo."
3,Lid snap broke,"All in all, it holds a decent amount of food and moves around pretty well but the most important feature is the lid and it broke after about three weeks of daily use. The snaps are thin plastic tabs and one of the two broke off with just normal use. Disappointing it still works okay but not like it should."
1,This is NOT air tight!,"I started having ant problems due to snow melt and rain. I found them in my dog's food and had to throw it all out. So I decided to buy this product because it advertised that it was air tight. I received it yesterday. I pushed in the sides of the container and air rushed out, hence it is not air tight. If air comes in then ants can get in. This was a very disappointing purchase and I would not recommend it."
2,Great...if you're a fan of broken lids,"Love the containers, hate the lids. I bought two of these pet food keepers not long ago. When they were delivered, the lid on one was already broken. It wasn't that bad so I decided to just keep it. Not long after, that lid broke in another spot and became useless. I wasn't thrilled but I had a 2nd one so I just chalked it up to ""just one of those things"". Then the 2nd lid broke. I'm guessing if I had a third one, the lid on that would break too. Like I said...love the containers, hate the lids. Unless you have something else to cover the container with...keep looking."
2,not pet proof or long lasting,"i have a larger size that holds 30lbs of kibble (not here on amazon) with wheels -- but the design is otherwise the same. yes it seems odorproof... but i guess not - as my dogs managed to knock it over and off broke the lid, breaking the plastic pins that hold it - rendering both halves useless. a second fell over and the lid broke off. they replaced that one years ago. but when i complained this one broke too easily they stated - sounds like its broken - here's where you can buy a new one. customer service fail. (note that i own several of these - so its not like i am trying to get a replacement of a replacement). I use them for bird seed, cat food, and pet food. i would say its fine for bird seed - keeps out mice etc (in the shed), but it cannot stand up to pets trying to get into it. also - the previous version has wheels - not inset - but that's more convenient."
3,"Nice Size, Poor Quality","Loved this when I first got it, although the lid was tan, not blue, but that's fine. It easily fits a 30 pound bag of dog food, but after only having it 2 months, the wheel broke. There's no kids in the house or anything, and nothing heavy sitting on it, just wheeling it from the storage space to the counter. If the quality was better, it would be an excellent product."
2,Not As Air Tight As Advertised,I bought this container because I needed an airtight plastic bin for my dogs' treats and snacks. The outside label on the product even advertised an airtight seal but there's no seal on the bin. I feel like I wasted money on this product and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. A cardboard box would have sufficed if I was just looking for a regular container.
5,Great item,It is a great dog treat keeper. Wish lid was a little stronger but tape holds it down. Would buy one again.
2,food storage,the size is fine but the container itself does not seem to be airtight -- which you need for pet food storage. very flimsy.
3,tall with a simpler lid than the Iris brand,This is tall enough for rolled up silicone parchment mats and baguette pans but it may not fit inside cabinets.
1,Poor Construction. Deliberately Delivered Broken.,"Flimsy Construction on both the plastic container itself, as well as the airtight seal located in the rim of the top. I ordered 2: The first, had a useless stretched out rubber seal within the top and the top does not stay closed securely - with any vibration it would pop open. The second was taped closed with packaging tape - I assume for safer transport - however, the broken off lock-latch was deliberately placed inside the bin before taping it closed. I returned for reimbursement and am now looking at the IRIS products. I suggest moving on."
5,Housing Solutions,"America's Housing Problem: An Approach to its Solution by Irving Welfield presents criteria for evaluating federal programs for housing production and housing assistance, measures these programs against the criteria, and discusses an alternative set of programs. The latter, he concludes, would achieve far better results than the existing efforts. As an example, his comparisons show that, by shifting to the proposed alternatives the same number of new units could be constructed and nine times more poor households could be assisted at no increase in cost. -- form book's back cover"
5,Don't miss this one.,"Like Mr. Myers, I appreciate brevity and clear language. In that spirit, all I have to say is....Read this book. I promise you will not be disappointed. You may not agree with him, but you will be entertained."
4,Rant on brother,"I rather liked this little book. I remember the essay in The Atlantic Monthly. I liked the essay then, and agreed with much of what Myers said. So it was nice to come across the essay in full like this. He takes on the pretentiousness of today's literary scene (and I've read a lot of the prize winners, so I know [what] wins). I haven't read much of the authors he used as his examples (Paul Auster, Don DeLillo, David Guterson, Cormac McCarthy, and Annie Proulx), but it doesn't matter. Myers doesn't get into plot or characters. You don't have to be familiar with the books (though it would help, I'll reread the chapters of this book as I read the works by those authors). He takes on the language they use. And nine times out of ten, Myers is right. This essay/book should get more attention. It's the equivalent of Dana Gioia's Can Poetry Matter?, only for the world of fiction."
3,Provocative take on contemporary lit.,"The thesis of this book is that contemporary American literature is pretentious, deliberately obscure, dull, insular, and just badly written overall. Myers provides us with some of his favorite examples dedicating large sections to Annie Proulx, Don DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Auster and David Guterson. He gives what he considers a representative sample from each which he then dissects, pointing out poor metaphors, bad grammar, and confused writing.If you enjoy reading bad reviews, you should like this. I enjoyed it, and for the most part agree with the author that much of contemporary lit is trendy and unreadable. That said, I don't know how much of this is new, and I can quote lines from Faulkner that make Proulx seem downright direct."
1,Total Whitewash of a Bitter and Divisive Man,"This book is a total whitewash of the deep seated resentments and divisiveness that this man created, and is designed to appeal to people of italian descent, conservatives and law enforcement. It has low regard for the facts, dealing instead with nostalgia, heresay and innuendo (the writer never knew Frank), while ignoring the obvious personal, political and police corruption. It paints an unfair picture of Frank Rizzo as a smart leader, when in reality this man had little going for himself except Philadelphia residents longing for the 'good ole days.'"
4,Great Addition to Your Multitool Stable,"Multitools are great, ever since the original Swiss Army knife. The Leatherman line improved it with pliers and locking blades. But the needle-nose pliers on normal Leathermen provide limited leverage and grip, and their long noses can be a hindrance in tight spaces. This product, the Crunch, helps remedy that oversight. Its primary utility is as a collapsible pair of vise-grip pliers. The blade and other tools included are rather small, and consequently of limited utility. But if the Cruch were added to a standard Leatherman multitool (on your belt, in the trunk of your car, on your boat, etc.), you would be well-equipped to deal with almost any situation that called for a field repair or other displays of mechanical prowess. I am quite pleased with mine."
3,Very practical carry on tool!,"This is a nice item, it works fine and it is really small and easy to fit in the pocket. But it started getting some rust a couple days after I bought it, and I had not even used it by then! I keep it in my backpack on its own pocket, it has no direct contact with water or aggressive liquids and still its getting more and more rust on it! I chose this instead of a Victorinox multitool because of the locking pliers, but the quality of the steel is really far from that of Victorinox knifes!!! REALLY FAR!!! It is still useful, that is why I'm not rating it lower, but it looks crappy."
3,a little cumbersome,"The tool has most of the functions I need, but it's a little unwieldy unfolding and getting ready to use the tool needed. The screwdriver blades need to be longer, to keep the body (in this case handle) of the tool further away from the work. On the plus side, the saw blade is VERY sharp."
4,vise grip leatherman,Compact tool with a plier head that allows you to grip bolt heads more effectively than a regular plier. The one draw back to the tool is having to connect the head to the handle once unfolded but the vide group head makes it worth the time it takes to assemble.
3,Awkward folding mechanism,"A very useful multi-tool, but I strongly advise try the crunch out in a store before purchasing. The adjustable clamping mechanism takes quite a while to assemble, and I have pinched my hands on numerous occasions. Perhaps it is just not what I was expecting, I assumed it would simply function as a typical Leatherman."
5,Leatherman Crunch in a pinch.,"Leatherman Crunch was a Big Hit with my theatre-technical-director son. He finds it handy for all those small, odd jobs for which he doesn't need the big electrical tools."
3,Crunch Leatherman,"Well made but never a replacement for standard tools. Good when you have to have a small bundle of everything in case you get ""caught in a pinch"". Locking jaws can act like a 3rd hand which is it's most redeeming quality. Way too pricey but nice."
5,excellent guide,"Domar is a smart, well-informed, articulate author who writes very well about a difficult subject. She provides concrete examples of how to adjust your attitude toward infertility, including advice on managing both depression and anxiety. This isn't just another book telling you ""just relax and you'll get pregnant"": she demonstrates how a positive attitude can help boost your fertility, but more importantly, she reminds you of ways you can enjoy your life regardless of your fertility."
2,Depressing,I found after reading the first part of this book i became very depressed. I had to stop reading it because it made me feel very helpless.
4,Helpful,I liked this book because it gave suggestions on relaxing and trying to deal with infertility. It gave me ideas on what to do when I am feeling anxious. I know how to handle my emotions better.
4,Great book for coping skills when TTC,"After reading this book, I definetly have more coping skills for managing the stress and anxiety of our fertility journey. Domar devotes a whole chapter to relaxation techniques and stratedgies, which I am already seeing the benefits of everyday! In my opinion, she spends a little too much time discussing the sadness, jealousy, and anger some women feel towards their pregnant family and friends. Don't get me wrong, I definetly identified with the emotional sadness and struggle, but felt it was over discussed. I will keep this book handy as we start our second IVF, hopefully much more relaxed this time!Best of luck for healthy babies in 2008,Jamie Lynne"
3,Informative but too much of a marketing tool for author,"After having read several books on infertility, I must say that this one was the one I liked the least. Although there were sections that were very informative, the author ended every other paragraph with, ""if you come to my mind-body classes, you will get pregnant."" All of us who are going through this infertility rollercoaster, truly believe that going to our doctor, following his/her plan of treatment and doing only good things for ourselves, will bring a positive result. We don't need someone telling us that we should travel or look out for the next workshop in order to guarantee fertility. Too subjective and author had her own agenda which doesn't make for a positive experience. There are other books that can help you cope with infertility rather than tell you that what you're doing is wrong. Try Laugh-in Infertility. I could not stop laughing with this book and it made me feel better about my situation."
3,Not what I expected.,"From the title of this book, I thought it would include lots of mind/body techniques to help you deal with infertility and the stress of IVF. However, only a couple of chapters dealt with breathing techniques and visualization etc. The rest were all about how to deal with family members, different case stories/success stories. If you don't have unsupportive people in your life you really don't need this book. However, I will go back and read the 2 chapters that had decent information."
2,nothing new here,I didn't find that this book had any new information or forsight into the issue of fertility.
3,Conquering Infertility: Dr. Alice Domar's Mind/Body Guide to Enhancing Fertility and Coping with Infertility,"The book is very informative, but is based on relaxation as the premise for increased fertility. If you are the type of person who does not find relaxation methods inviting, this book is not for you."
3,Sin Secrets and Success,"Aside from typographical errors, and switching from 1st, 2nd and 3rd person speaking...the book was not bad. I did want to read the sequel...but I guess Carolyn gave up. Editing would have been a great tool to use."
4,i know people like this!,"This book was a great read to me that kept you turnning the pages even if at a time you did not know why you just could not put it down. I know people who live like this and I know this world, so these women where already like some of my close friends. The one thing that will kind of throw you off from time to time is the readding when it is talking to you the reader an you didi not know it had switched from telling the story to talking to you. But by all means give this book a shot an see for your self."
2,Do Not Even Waste Your Time!,"Oh my goodness this book was a hot mess! A person would think by looking at the title that the book would be hot! Full of freaky stuff and die hard secrets! What??? The author needs work. First of all she talks to the audience-Why in the world does she do that??? Very bad. She asks the audience ""can you feel me ladies""? i mean come on what is that. The book is bad. There is no other way to put it...the charecters are a mess. People killing people, down low stuff...it may sound juicy but trust me...it's not! please don't waste your money."
1,AUTHOR NEED TO TAKE A CLASS ON HOW TO WRITE A NOVEL,"THIS BOOK IS OH SO HORRIBLE. THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH BEING DION'S WIFE, STOCK-BROKER, FINANCIAL PLANNER,REAL ESTATE CONSULTANT OR INSURANCE AGENT. THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE STOOD IN THE MALL PARKING LOT AND HANDED OUT EVERY COPY OF THIS BOOK FOR FREE. I WISH THE AUTHOR ALL THE SUCCESS ON HER NEXT NOVEL."
1,Don't do it!!!!!!!!!,"I read the first two chapters and put this book down. The writing was hard to understand, and the characters were completely underdeveloped!"
1,Not Good At ALL!,"If I could rate this novel 0 stars I would.It was poorly written, the characters lacked substance, and they were not well developed to say the least. I wasn't surprised to find out that this novel was the authors first. She wrote VERY UNREALISTICALLY and one second the characters were having dialogue and the next second the main character/ narrator Candece was speaking to the reader.I didnt enjoy this book and I struggled to finish it, so obviously I wouldn't recommend it to an avid reader like myself."
3,Dissapointment,"Should have been called ""Sins, Secrets & Trash"". The storyline was juvenile, ghetto, and unintelligent. These women weren't only friends, but tramps and nasty too. The only reason I gave the book 3 stars is because the last couple of chapters made up for the entire book.Yes, Ms. Sanders left the story open for another book. But, I won't waste anymore money."
3,Friends Indeed,"This was a good book to read. However I did not like how the author kept talking directly to the reader ""you feel me"". The characters were a trip. First, Candice says she hasn't had sex in 2 years. But she soon made up for it. And don't we know an Amber. Letting her boyfriend control her but she really got the last laugh. Toi was typical as well until she had to choose if she wanted to keep her relationship with Johnny, I don't know to many women who would continue that relationship especially to witness first hand what she did. The ending was ok maybe a little vague. I wanted more drama between Candice, Fred and Michael but who doesn't like a happy ending."
5,so adorable. i miss him so,I was totally suprised to see this little bear in my list of items to review. y apartment caught fire in 2005 and my little bear was destroyed. I really loved him. So cute.great quality
5,Invaluable for writers - and teachers,"As a high school teacher, I've enjoyed Ms. Wallraff's newspaper column - and wondered how she accumulated the resources to answer the language questions posed and with such grace, tact and knowledge. Now I have an inkling, in this book, and it is a long-overdue and welcome companion in my classroom."
2,"Good information, terrible format","I put this down after reading the first chapter, and realized that the rest of the book used the same format. (The author used letters from readers and then commented on their grammar questions.) A good editor could have made this great, but it's tedious at best."
5,Great CD!,"Loved this album. It was easy to download, and our kids sing and dance and ask for this CD by name all the time. Thanks KIDZUP for such great music!"
4,Prettty good stuff,This is a pretty good collection and has a lot of variety. Keeps our toddler entertained enough and it's handy to have loaded on my phone with the Amazon MP3 app for whenever we need to distract her. My only small complaint is all the songs are by the same woman it seems. Nothing bad about that but changing up the singers would have been nice too.
1,Did not receive!!,I was looking forward to receiving some peppy little music -- did not get it down loaded -- need help -- was billed but did not receive.
4,I enjoy cup stacking,These are great for kids. It teaches them eye Coordination. It feels a little different than the one they sell on speedstacks.com but they are still good. This one has one big hole instead of 3 little holes. You can clip these to your backpacks belt loop or anything else. They're cheaper than the ones on speedstacks.com so I got these. These come with directions. I enjoy these.
5,Hard to find,"These are not easy to come by, and I have been rationing mine for some time now. Worthwhile stockpiling these if you have this Juicerator model. True, the filters seem old-fashioned now that technology has sped ahead from decades ago when home juicers first appeared on the market. But I bought my Acme Juicerator in the mid-70s, and it still works great. That's my idea of a keeper."
1,Aboslutely Morbid,"I read the excerpt for this book on Xlibris, and was appalled at the terrible writing. Its like a book written by a first grader! The grammar is awful, the plot idiotic (dinosaurs and people apparently existed at the same time 10,000 years ago), and all in all the book makes no sense. No wonder this loser's sale rank is so bad. He probably bought a few books himself just to raise it!"
1,Failed in just over a year.,"I bought one of these to provide uninterrupted power to my computer, internet and a NAS. The device failed less than two months after the 1 year warranty had expired. It no longer charges my batteries and says it's over loaded, even when nothing is plugged in. I now have a 400 dollar boat anchor, not to mention another 400 worth of batteries, cables and the trip-lite remote switch that I bought to go with it."
3,"convenient, dodgy.","this is a great all-in-one solution for battery-based off-the-grid power. I spent a lot of time researching chargers and inverters and which ones I should combine before I found this, which does both easier and much cheaper for comparable performance.my only suggestion would be for them to add a couple of fused terminals for direct DC power that could be shut off when the voltage is too low, but we can't have everything I guess.UPDATE: after about 3 years of light summer usage, this thing up and completely quit on me. no power, nothing. it was nice while it lasted, but far too much to spend on something that is just going to fail after a while."
1,Very disappointing,One can get this level of dirty power in a $100 inverter. I am shocked. Maybe it is defective as the previous reviewer had the same experience. Some of us have distortion meters and scopes. Very disappointing. returning.
1,Dead on arriaval. Do not buy this product,"Amazon accepted and cancelled order for cables at least twice, Had to leave on foreign trip, Came back on 28th january, 2013bought cables locally and hooked up inverter and battery, As a precaution checked voltage across fuse terminals.without fuseand without load plugged into inverter, The voltage was 13,0 volt. Checked inverters internal resistance without any load. It was zero.This means the inverter is dead i.e shorted out. I am disappointed in Amazons quality control and Tripp Lites quality. From now onI will buy only brand name productsfrom Amazon. This was an expensive lesson for me."
4,Explaining the manuscript point of view of the book,"In a review by ""The Old Philosopher"" above he states that he doesn't find this books covers the classic Celtic art. Probably that';s because the title includes the words ""Illumunated manuscripts"" in it."
1,No Load,"The puzzles in this game are sophamoric busy work, no cleverness at all. Graphics are nice but after running back and forth countless times they become boring. Worst of all is the time you waste loading each disk, five minutes at a time, sometimes four times in a row. There is way too much inventory [at one point I counted 41 items and I had a long way to go]. The designers seem to have a fasination with skulls,23 in inventory for 2 seperate puzzles with lots more laying around. Some of the clues are so illegible you have no choice but to go to hint lines for help. I liked the first Riddle of the Sphinx but this one is a big waste of money."
3,Tiresome,"Isn't it weird how you feel tired when your game character has to travel and walk all over the place? That is how I felt in this game. A lot of walking through dark places, picking up inventory items and then travelling to a new place. I loaded the whole game so didn't have to swap discs but still had about a 1 1/2 load time for games on a PIII866. The worse part was my hard drive crashed and I had to start all over again. Made myself finish but really wanted to abandon it. Most annoying moment - the chemical mixture. I was bored, kept getting distracted and would lose count on the measurements. Wouldn't recommend as story line is not that interesting."
2,Boring,"I just finished playing the Omega Stone and feel I have just wasted a good bit of my time. Though I agree with the other reviewer that the graphics are very good, the puzzles are rather easy to solve and I didn't feel any real purpose while playing the game. I would say that if you are looking for an entertaining adventure game, try Syberia, which though relatively easy, is much more entertaining."
2,Too Confusing...,"This game was way too confusing. The graphics were great and all, but most of the time you were going through caves or mazes and getting lost. I spent a lot of time going to the walkthrough which I hate doing. The clues were not enough to help you figure out what you were suppose to do next. In one puzzle, I had no idea what to do, so I went to the walkthrough and as I was reading the clue, I sat there trying to figure out how anyone would figure that one out on their own. I finished the game, but with the help of the walkthrough so that's no fun. I never had any loading issues since I played the game from a web site called [...] So, if you love games that make go back and forth searching for stuff you might or might not use, then this game is for you."
5,We want more!,Oh no! Bear can't sniff!! But all is well with friends like those found in the Big Blue House. And where is Snowbear? Ojo gets a hand from Tutter and the Otters in a time of need as well. Keep 'em coming we want more!
2,poorly presented,"I purchased this book a few months ago, and in studying for the exam, I have found many flaws. The grammar is often quite poor, even to the point that I am stuck trying to understand the meaning of a sentence. The proofs skip steps and are not explained well enough. Finally, the choice of variables will often change mid-problem. (The radius will be given as R, and then used in the solution as r.)This book may serve many people well, but I recently completed a college calculus course that was based on proofs, so when I do not understand how the text jumped from point A to point B, I stop and try to figure it out even though a person simply must understand how to use an equation and not how it was derived."
3,lots of facts,I'm using this book for a graduate seminar and while it is certainly comprehensive it is overwhelming in its detail and very disappointing in interpretation and analysis. There are pages in which each sentence decribes a different country and there is no effort made to reach any conclusion or interpretation of what all those sentences are supposed to mean. Writing European history which is inclusive is very difficult and Gildea has certainly tried to include all nations not just the major powers but the result will leave most readers bewildered.
4,Love the Colorful Photos!,"I now have both volumes concerning Board Games by this author. I purchased both because of the marvelous photos of the games. Some of them I once owned or saw on the department store shelves growing up. Some, I still own, like my Spy Detector Game. Looking through the pages, just brings back many fond memories. Especially in this age of Computer Games and X-Boxes. Nothing is like the ""Board Game"" with its various pawns and pieces, moved around on an artistic designed square piece of cardboard. If I had any complaint it would be that besides every box game cover provided, there were pictures of every board and pieces as well. This is the reason I gave this book four, instead of five stars."
3,broke,I have used the watch twice and it has already stoped working. the recall button will not let me recall splits. when it was working i liked the watch alright.
4,The real stuff,"If you want to clean tarnished copper pipes or wires in prep for soldering, this is the product to use. Some other products (aka ruby...) that come in larger sizes for less money are not nearly as effective (if effective at all). Don't waste your time or money on them. This time the adage ""you get what you pay for"" is correct. I did a side-by-side comparison test with two identical badly corroded wires and it was No Contest. The competitor's product did essentially nothing, while this product cleaned the wires perfectly. I would have liked to be able to return unused fluid to the container more easily, so subtracted one star for ease of use."
2,Clean and cold solder,"No need to clean oxidized copper, but the left over flux is conductive which you'll need to clean it anyways.I had difficulty making the solder flow with this flux.The flux that i use at my Job is a lot better than this."
5,Item has done its job,This item was very good used it to clean out the connection in my Play station 3 and i assume it worked well but cant really tell to be honest i just sen videos that say to use it.
4,Caution - Only one set of HD component input jacks,"Caution - this HDTV has only one set of HD component inputs. Most buyers of HDTV will want at least two HD inputs jacks. One set will be used for the HD set top box (cable, airwave or dish feed - 1080i)and another for a progressive scan DVD (480p). XBox users would want yet another HD input option.This TV does provide a second component input jack but the manual explains that this is for standard DVD input (480i). Why buy a HDTV unless you can use it to its full potential?Great picture, good sound, but the set lacks in very basic connection options. Other 27"" HDTV's don't have this problem."
5,Best film of the year; perhaps the best film of all time.,"Absolutely riveting. Javier Bardem is a revelation. Best Actor won't do justice to his powerful performance as dissident Cuban writer Reynaldo Arenas. Schnabel does a fantastic job of contrasting the beauty of the Cuban landscape (and the subsequent beauty Arenas tries to create within the ugliness of New York City) with the misery of a writer who is oppressed by the very dictatorship he ran away from home to support. We are never allowed to forget the simple joys that punctuate Arenas' life, and that makes every twist of the knife hurt just a little more.The twenty-third film I have ever seen to receive five stars. It will definitely be in the Top Ten of the All-Time Top 100; it may well be number one. An absolutely perfect film."
2,Best for those with prior knowledge of its subject,"BEFORE NIGHT FALLS(USA - 2000)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalThe life and times of Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas, whose political viewpoint and experiences as a gay man rendered him unwelcome in his home country.Evocative study of a renowned artist whose craft was forged under duress, within a political system which defined Art and sexuality as two sides of the same 'dangerous' cultural coin. Viewers with a prior knowledge of Arenas' life and work will derive more from the episodic narrative than most casual viewers, though no one could fail to be impressed by Javier Bardem's Oscar-nominated performance in the central role. Strong supporting cast, too, including Johnny Depp in brief - but memorable - dual roles, Olivier Martinez (as Arenas' closest friend) and a virtually unrecognizable Santiago Magill (DON'T TELL ANYONE) as one of Bardem's early sexual conquests. Directed by Julian Schnabel (BASQUIAT)."
5,Thank you,Thank you for sendin g this movie so fast. It was a great movie and Johnny Depp looks good as a blonde woman.
2,so many gaps in the story,"This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story."
3,pobre inocente!,javier bardem stars as cuban poet reinaldo arenas in this stolid and overlong biopic (with pretensions of artiness) that lets us know that castros cuba is not a workers paradise especially if youre a flitty gay poet. better in its longings than in its execution.
3,Maybe it's me,"This movie just didn't do much for me. I found it agonizingly slow, and another annoying testament to an artist who had to die to be appreciated; who worked his entire life producing only to remain penniless and uninsured even in his final days. If Castro's Cuba is so bad, what does that say about America? Anyway, I will say that the cinematography was beautiful and it did transport you to another world, and that I always appreciate - the beauty of the color, the music, the earth, sea and sky. I appreciated the fine art of Johnny Depp, I must have missed Sean Penn.I guess it depends on what you want to see it for. There are some rather nasty torture scenes and nudity. Not a date movie, but if you are studying art or the artist himself, go for it."
4,Fighting for Freedom,"Powerful screenplay based on the autobiography of the exiled Cuban author, Reinaldo Arenas.Arenas was a gay Cuban author and poet who was persecuted by the Castro regime and fled Cuba in 1980 (the Mariel Boat-lift) and ended up in New York City, where he continued to write and rail against the Communists. In 1990, stricken with AIDS and without health insurance, he committed suicide with drugs and alcohol. It's a painful and heart-wrenching story, but the acting is superb and there are moments of true mirth along with those of care and tenderness. Javier Bardem is fabulous playing Arenas in this movie!Recommended!"
2,"Only Johnny Depp was great, the rest, bad accents!","Well, my first complaint with this movie is that it has too many Spanish dialogues when the movie is supposed to be in English language. Unfortunately, English subtitles were not provided on the VCD. It is very difficult to appreciate the movie especially when you can't understand half of what the characters were saying. I don't understand why they have to speak a heavy accented English when they could just do the movie in Spanish then just provide subtitles?On my opinion, only Johnny Depp did a fine performance in this movie although I don't understand why he'd allow himself to do a cameo on this kind of film. I'm sorry but it is not the kind of quality film I was expecting. I'm sure the book is a better version"
1,Firmly Disappointing and Boring,"All right, let's be honest. We all wanted to appreciate this film and feel that it was deep and meaningful. However, it was sorely disappointing. The characters, perhaps meant to be portrayed in artful vignettes, were completely undeveloped and unrealistic. I can't imagine the storyboard for this movie, because it must have looked like a poured-out jigsaw puzzle on the dining room table. Not only were there multiple flashback scenes interwoven in odd sequences which subracted from the movie's flow, but these were interlaced with hallucinations on the part of Reinaldo. In the end, nothing was explained well enough for the audience to sympathize with the character. Overall, this movie is a vapid attempt at cinematic depth. I sincerely wish that I had been able to appreciate this film in the way I feel I could have. It is unfortunate that such a brilliant writer's life and writings would be made so insipid and flat through this piece."
1,Dissapointment,Slow and not very well made. Nothing special or original. Very annoying story telling style. Little to no substance mainly location and sets. Big dissapointment.
1,before night falls,This movie was terrible in that it had explicit male to male sex scenes that I didn't need to see with my friends and nude male bodies and no sub titles and spanish? only for about half of the movie. Not entertaining at all.
4,Watch Javier Bardem's career!,"I first saw Javier Bardem in Jarmon, Jarmon, so I was amazed by his performance in Before Night Falls. He carries the movie with grace and credibility. This film is based on the memoir of a globally recognized writer who began his work during Castro's revolution. Initially, he supported Castro, but like many revolutions, once the hero takes over, frequently there are persecutions of anyone who does not fit the mold required by the new dictator. Our writer, sensitive and homosexual, becomes anenemy of the state and must go into hiding to survive. This film, while flawed, is a poignant portrayal of the importance of freedom to all. It is a haunting revelation of the impact communism and other restraints have on the freedom of expression and lifestyles. Watch this film for Bardem's performance."
4,Great film but some pieces missing,"I admit I did not know anything about Reynaldo Arenas before seeing this film. I have become a huge Javier Bardem film and wanted to see some of his earlier work. I thought the film was very well done and held my interest very well until the final 30 or so minutes of the film. The final year of Arenas' life in NYC does not follow the same pace as the rest of the film and dragged a bit for me. I also wished that the film would have gone into a little more detail about the writing of ""Before Night Falls"" and his years in NYC where he was free to write, which I felt was lost in the final scenes.Javier Bardem's performance is excellent and overall I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This is an adquate tripod. Things that this model lacks that you may want that come with higher priced models include the quick-release lever and a case. The tripod itself is fairly stable. The mechanism itself is comprised of what feels like cheep plastic. Still, it does work as advertised. If you are looking for a no-frills, low-end tripod, this is for you. And let's face it, if you intend to spend $12 on a tripod, you can't expect too much."
4,Good Quality Tripod,"This tripod is well worth the money. It locks firmly into position and is made of what appears to be quality materials. I used it at deer camp last weekend, it worked flawlessly. When purchasing tripods be aware of the height as they come in many different heights. This is a good buy."
4,Good buy,"I bought this tripod used from a co-worker and it works well. It holds my dslr steady for shooting my family in or out doors. Also works well with my handycam. If your looking for a heavy duty state of the art tripod, you may want to spend more then 20 dollars. If you want a good deal for a item you will use every now and then, this is for you."
4,Basic tripod - Samsonite 1100,"I have no complaints with this tripod. Then again I don't use it on a daily basis. It gets the job done though and for the price its fine, does the job, easy to use etc. I would buy it again....no regrets here."
3,Good read!,"Salsa! Havana Heat, Bronx Beat is a good book. You'll find it to be an easy and good read into the history of ""Afrocuban/Salsa"". The book does make a number of errors, such as, stating that Tito Puente is a Cuban musician, when in fact he was born in New York City of Puerto Rican parents. I also did not agreed with a some of Mr.Calvo's ""left-wing"" analysis. Nevertheless, on balance, I believe this is a book you will enjoy and worth reading."
2,to expensif,"the book I orderd did cost over usd 40.--.but it has only 58 pages, incl. cover and pictures. this is far to expensif. the seller should mention howmany pages a book has.regardsw"
4,"Great ""Convenience Cookbook""","I LOVE this book. Just recieved it for christmas. It is full of simple recipes that convert common grocery store food to more homey treats. Further, there are alot of time saving tips. All in all a really good book for people who like to cook but don't have time to complete complex recipes on a regular basis."
3,"Good recipes, decent book, but not all by Jenkins","I know one of the women who contributed to this cookbook. Gaenell Stegall of Martinsville, Va., gave Jenkins her recipe for Chinese Chews and Lazy Woman's Peach Cobbler. In fact, Jenkins solicited recipes from cooks in Southside Virginia. Her book, though, reads as if Jenkins created all the recipes herself and then was just ""reminded"" about the dishes by the cooks listed in the book. The recipes are good and begin with store-bought ingredients, but be aware that Jenkins borrowed them from cooks in southern Virginia. But her book doesn't really give them the credit they deserve. This cookbook is basically a glorified version of a church or organizational cookbook, which you could get in your own community at a lower price."
2,Misleading title,I was expecting ways to easily jazz up convenience foods. This book is mostly recipes with lists of ordinary common ingredients. Some of the recipes I intend to try - have been looking for a while for a lasagne recipe that you don't have to cook the noodles. But overall this was not what I expected. Not saying don't buy it. Just know what you're getting.
2,There can be side effects.,"I took 600 mg of Alpha Lipoic Acid a day for 23 days. This was under a Dr's advise. It was to treat burning mouth which is my side affect from acid reducers. ALA took away my pain in about a week. But, on day 13 I woke up confused and couldn't remember how to take my medicine. That happened once. On day 21 I started with a mild headache. Two days later it was a migraine. Up to this point I was getting increasingly tired each day. The day of my migraine, I was so tired I slept all day. I had quit taking the ALA the day before the migraine. It took 5 days before most of my energy was back. From what I have read, I think it was playing with my blood sugar level as well as my thyroid medication. If your body can tolerate it, it does relieve pain. My Dr. told me to stop taking this."
5,One of the Best Values You Can Find on Christian Software,"I can't BELIEVE that this set is sold for $37 bucks! My goodness, look at what you get! The Macarthur Study Bible and the MacArthur Topical Bible are worth the price of this CD-ROM already! But on top of that, you get a ton of his books (The Gospel According to Jesus being one of them), and his Commentaries on Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and one or two others. You also get some wonder Nelson dictionaries and reference resources, and other things I probably failed to mention.Moreover, this software uses the slick and sensational Libronix Digital Software System. Buy this CD-ROM NOW!Rev. Marc Axelrod"
3,Great Material - Software Stinks,"The MacArthur material is super great. The Libronix Digital Software System is a nightmare. It will never update properly. Once you move up to Internet Explorer 7, it will not work at all. Buy it but do not invest much money in Libronix Software.You are better off to get your MacArthur material in Bible Navigator or WordSearch if you can. Unfortunately, the Life Works collection only comes in Libronix.Libronix Digital Software System is HORRIBLE SOFTWARE. It can be hard to load - its updates will lock the program up - tech support will tell you that it is your machine - etc. I know three folks who have experienced problems with the software."
1,Tedious Product and Tech Support,Locked up on install. Continues to never load making the whole thing useless. Tech support does not answer a phone. Its email support only...making things more tedious
1,Terrible software,This software is a waste of money. It locked up on installation. I was told to download IT 7. Did not solve problem.
4,"Excellent, but....","Have always wanted to try one, and finally gave in and ordered it.Two complaints:One, cleaning is not so easy, as the plates are not removable, but it isn't too bad either, so not a stopping point.Second, for me, it is too small. For a single person, maybe it is ok, but for my daughter and I, it just doesn't hold enough.In summary, do I like it, yes, definately, but I will soon be replacing it with one that is larger.ken"
3,Little Champ Needs a Work Out,"I bought this as a gift for an elderly woman. The bun warmer lid is fastened so securely that she cannot get it open. It was hard for me to get it open, but with effort I could do it. The grill plates do not come off the grill so she is unable to remove them for easy cleaning. The grill is too heavy for her to hold at the sink with one hand and clean with the other, so she uses a sponge while it sits in place on her counter.I gave it three stars for the convenience of it's size, especially for a person who lives alone to use."
4,I love this little grill,"I love this little grill! The bun warmer is definitely a plus on it. Everything on it is compact and easy to store. The only problem I had with it is grease buildup - some always remain in the grill, no matter how many times you clean it. But at this price, you can afford to get another one every 2-3 years without breaking the bank."
3,Useless Bunwarmer Feature,"The grill itself is as advertised BUT the bunwarmer feature on top is useless. It is literally too small to insert more than one bun at a time and is too shallow in that it actually ""squashes"" ONE bun that has been inserted in halves. This was a normal sized bun, not a large one. If I had it to buy over again, I would go with the cheaper model without the bunwarmer feature on top. It would be the same grill without the useless bunwarmer."
3,"do not buy this grill, buy the new version!","I like this grill a lot but cleaning is awful. There is a new George Forman Grill out called ""George Foreman GRP99 Next Generation Grill with Removable Plates"" that will be similar this grill but with removable grill plate for easy cleaning."
4,Too small for more than one person but it works well,"I was unsure about the George Foreman School of Cuisine but my sister (who has a big one) raved about how fast and easy it is. She's right. It IS fast. It IS easy. But the Champ is just a wee bit too small to get down to business with if you are cooking for more than one person. I wish Salton would add a variable temperature control to its design, which is a good one. My main tip for cooking on it is to turn the food once as the top plate does get hotter than the bottom one. The bun warmer is a joke.Overall, if you are one person and not looking to cook a feast, this size of Foreman will do you fine. Try marinated grilled shrimp or portobello mushrooms on it. It does a fine job."
4,Works well but is really small and a pain to clean,This is the first George Foreman Grill that we purchased. It is good for cooking things like hamburgers because it drains so much of the grease out of the meat during cooking. However it tends to leave the meat very dry so it takes some getting used to. When you see what drains out into the grease catcher you will be glad that you aren't eating it. The bun warmer is pretty cook and works well. This machine is pretty small and you can only cook two small hamburgers on it at once or one large one. It works well for serving one person but that's about it. The one thing about this unit that really turns me off is that it doesn't have removal plates with makes it a pain to clean. This is the reason that we ended up getting rid of this grill and upgrading to the large grill with removable plates. It's about double the price but is well worth it.
4,good for the most part,Overall its pretty good... it cooks my burgers pretty good. no so well on bacon. so far i only tried burgers.the only bad thing about this thing is that its hard to clean the plates
2,Definatly not the best...,"I had a different grill at another time, so I guess I can say I was spoiled. But this was really a disappointment to me. There is no timer for this, so you will have to watch the clock when you cook things. Plus (the worse part) is that the surface gets quite warm. You can only eat something fully cooked if it is thin- like a very thin hamburger. The outside of the food will burn before the middle gets cooked. If you do try to risk cooking a fat hamburger and warm a bun at the same time, the moisture from the cooking goes right into the bun warmer, and makes the break a little wet on the ends. It gets a little annoying after a while. You will always have to plug it in whenever you need to use it- it is always on. With my other, when I was ready to cook, I just turned on the timer to warm up, and it would be ready. I guess with this, you get what you pay for, if you dont pay full price..."
4,A college student's review,"This relatively cheap Foreman grill does a great job cooking meats quickly and efficiently. It also cooks frozen meats surprisingly well. However, the only real downside to this product is the cleaning method. It is very difficult to clean in a sink and I have found the most effective way to clean it is by leaving it on and using a wet paper towel or rag with soap and wiping it down. If it were not for the difficulty in cleaning, this product would get 5 stars, otherwise it is great."
3,Latch broke immediately,"First of all the Grill works very well, heats quickly and does a great job.It is that bun warmer that is a dud. When I opened it the first time a piece of the latch broke off so now it makes a bit of a rattle when we open the lid. That is the only complaint I have.The bun warmer is probably not a good idea on these grills. The compartment is very small and it is possible for some one to try to use it as part of the grill, despite all the warnings. AND it breaks much too easily.It's not worth the effort to send the grill back and wait for a replacement, so we will live with it the way it is."
5,I like how I can warm my bUUns on it!,"It cooks food evenly, and fast. Warms up in what seems like minutes. I chop one onion and my foreman is already ready to throw on the rub a dub grub. I have the large model like pictured. It doesn't burn my morning sausage. I love it, and its easy to clean. Essential for those days of being locked up in the house during a grueling winter day and be missing the grill. Just bust out our foreman with the bun warmer, some mustard and maybe... some ketchupNOn stick, fast warm-up time, cooks evenly, works even better than thought, actually something good that was first advertised on TV.Tip- take ground beef, chopped onions, A1 steak sauce, a pinch of season salt mix all together and throw on your foreman. Add cheese and like YuM!"
4,Just what I expected,The GFG is a must have for every home. Bought as a gift and he loved it! Especially the bun warmer. What a great idea. I only wish they made this model in a bigger size. Fast delivery. Perfect Product!
4,"Useful, compact means of preparing veggies.","From the outset, I bought this machine to make healthier foods i.e. veggies for the family and it does not disappoint. So far I've grilled onions and I've done asparagus and sliced yams in a teriyaki-style marinade. Everything cooks up quickly and evenly. Keeping the grill veggies-only means I'm less concerned about whether food residue is left behind. (This grill IS a bit hard to clean.) After the surfaces cool down, I wipe thoroughly with a dry paper towel and it's ready for the next time."
2,Not as advertized,"The grill marks on the top are very shallow, making this device better for panini than for grilling meat. If that was what it was advertized for I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. The plastic cleaning fork is worthless, and the non-stick coating begins to flake after 6 months. The barely raised ridges on the top makes the top of your meat evenly brown & dry without the grill marks. The bottom is not nearly as cooked as the top, and has the best marks near the opening where the grill lines are raised to form ""teeth"" to hold the meat in. When the grill started flaking, I went back to the Cast Iron grill I can put over 2 burners & control the temperature. I still use this grill for grilling panini sandwiches, as it makes the bread nice & toasty. Not reccomended for meat unless you make sure they are even & level. Not very fun to clean."
5,Very Pleased by George,The George Foreman GR10ABW Champ Grill with Bun Warmer is an outstanding unit. We use it primarily when we are indoors to cook up Chicken Breasts. They come out moist and golden brown. The beast white chicken I have ever tasted! We is best about this unit is that it cooks to our liking consistently. It is also easy to maintain and clean. It is attractive and innocuous. We love it.
5,A Great Price for a Great Product!!,"I have only had mine for a few weeks, but it is one of the best buys you can make. It does exactly what it says it will do. Follow the directions and get the perfect steaks, chicken breasts, whatever. And, I also use it to reheat grilled sandwiches. Wonderful Patty Melts!!"
5,The best!,I could describe this grill with alots of words. It's just so simple to use. And also the price is not too big. It's so easy and quick. I recommend it to all of you.
3,Non-Stick Needs Work,"If you're considering this item you're probably like me; a lazy burger fan. There's lots to like about this grill. It's quite fast, fairly compact, has good weight and the price is right. All the time you'll save cooking your burger on two sides simultaneously will be lost to cleanup, unfortunately. I got two burgers out of it before the teflon coating (or whatever it is) eroded. And this was using Pam to thoroughly pre-coat the surfaces. Typically, my burgers now tear apart when I attempt to lift the cover after cooking. Cleanup requires lots of time and effort since this product is non-submersible. If I were doing it all again I'd opt for the pricier models with the removable (and hence, submersible) cooking surfaces, provided that the non-stick coating has been upgraded; in its present incarnation it's simply too thin to be of much use."
5,Excellent,This grill cooks a patty in a minute. It can also cook chicken. The oil tray is very useful. The grill is easy to clean and lasts.
1,Champ didn't knock me out,"Too small to cook more than one hamburger pattie at a time which eliminates the time saving aspect of this grill. Also, I found that the outer edge of even the thinnest burger did not brown. Add the time needed for cleaning and I find it faster and more efficient to use a stove top skillet. I'm giving this one away but maybe, I'll try a larger size."
5,Quick and easy,"I'm a long time user of the George Foreman grill. I really like it, just plug it in, no worries it doesn't over heat. My friend uses a grill pan and that takes twice the time the GF grill takes to cook. This is why I purchased the GF for my friend, as a christmas gift."
4,I love it,"I love my george foreman grill, it is so easy for the grand kids touse and give me more time for them"
3,Skip the Bun Warmer,Grill is great. It is my third electric grill (first George Foreman) and by far the easiest to clean and cooks the best. I find it to be amazingly fast compared to my last grill. The bun warmer handle broke on my second use of the grill. It is cheaply attached and the less than 1/16th inch size piece of plastic on the handle broke while I was trying to open it. I cleaned it up and put a piece of gaffers tape on it and have kept using it. Duct tape will also work but gaffers tape doesn't leave a sticky residue and comes in black so it doesn't look like a repaired appliance. So George Foreman makers please spend a little more on the handle and your concept will work. If you had used the grill before you put it on the market I might be given you a five star rating rather than three.
1,Another clunky appliance I won't use that is taking up space,"It made our turkey burgers great but we tried to do a thicker burger and it looked absolutely done on the outside (it was almost burnt) but it was absolutely raw!!!!The grill has been moved up in a rarely opened cabinet next to the sandwich maker and itty bitty crock-pot.Don't bother with this, just use your skillet on the stove top to make your burgers, etc....."
1,did not meet my expectations,"Was not what I expected from what I saw online. It was much smaller. I paid extra for fast shipping as it was to be a Christmas gift. I did not return it as it was going to cost me, with the extra shipping I already paid, double the cost of the item.I just gave it away to someone who said they would use it. I was very disappointed."
2,too heavy,"These shoes are far heavier than other steel toed shoes I have worn. If you are not on your feet all day, and want something that looks a bit more business-like, then they may be a good choice. But otherwise, I would suggest something lighter."
4,roses are red....,"I bought this for my 9 yr old daughter who loves writing poetry...Weird I know, but she has seemed to enjoy reading this to get ideas and proper forms..."
3,A little too simple,I am sure this book was written to be given to individual students. It is very simply written and would be a good resource for that use. It does not seem to be a good teaching resource though.
1,A book for beginners,"Here's what I didn't like: the personal approach to poetry writting, using as examples personal anecdotes at the beginning of some chapters; the use of bad poems written by students instead of poems written by great poets; the superficial approach to poetry writting.This is a book suitable for the very beginners. It wont satisfy poetry readers as well as poets.Sorry... that's what I think!"
4,A wonderfully moving story about an autistic child,"This book is set in rural England in the 30's and 40's. It gives a moving portrait of an autistic boy. He is very low functioning in many ways, but is still portrayed with love and dignity, in a way that should enable most ""normal"" children to relate to him in a positive way.The approach is emotional, rather than cognitive, and the author has put in a bit of magic to make things more interesting, but I think this is much better than the textbook approach for ""explaining"" autsm to other children.Also available in audio tape form."
4,Rating on it's own merits....,"I have read reviews from users here and at other sites, and I am amazed how many people are trashing this game because it's not HomeWorld. Forget Homeworld and judge it on its own merits. I have downloaded the demo and I think it's a great game. I've never played Homeworld, so I am not colored in my opinion. I agree the interface and the controls take a little getting used to, but that's part of the learning experience. I'm going to get the full game as soon as I get a chance."
1,Hegemohia Legions of Iron,"Save your money!!!! The graphics are great but the game ...! The single player mode is linear and boring. It is also buggy. In the multiplayer mode every time I try to play a scenerio the game freezes up and I have to restart my computer. I contacted the games tech support and the suggestion they gave me to correct it did not work. They also told me that other players are having the same problem. Please, save your money for something else. I wish I had!"
4,"Very cool, just takes some learning to get into","I really like this game. The concept is cool, the graphics are bloody good for a game of its age, and the atmosphere - while not as theatrical as Homeworld - is compelling and immersive.What holds me back on this game is the interface. It is, admittedly, a bit clumsy. Others have noted that there is not a true 3D interface - the geometry of the game is built around a 2-D plane with a Z-axis, but you can't really get away from that plane. That's fine. I think we'd all get a bit lost in real 3-space, unless you're a fighter pilot.I don't think ""steep learning curve"" is an accurate term here - just takes a little getting used to. Otherwise, a fun fun game."
2,Homeworld Lovers Beware....,"Hegemonia is a great game for some, but in my humble opinion it's ""okay"", I found the controls to be too awkward for my taste. Of course, being a bit biased, I kept comparing it to Homeworld and HW Cataclysm.So don't expect Hegemonia to play like Homeworld. Instead expect the game interface to be quite different. Maybe only then you can appreciate the difference. The majority of my friends, Homeworld players, simply hated the game...so you are warned.If you can't wait for Homeworld 2 to come out and got the itch go grab yourself a copy of the other 3D space game called O.R.B."
5,Best Tactical Spae Sim EVER!,"I havn't played Homeworld 2 - but -This game is quite simply the most beutfuil, well ballanced, well designd peice of software i have ever had the forutne to play - its one of the few games that i want to play from both wsides, and replay again and again!Theres a wide vairety of ways to accomplish each mission - but the standard- build the most/biggest/best ships rule does apply frequently - but tactics and placement of units is very important too.You feel like you are taking part in a movie on a epic scale more than playing a game - becuase the grpahics are just so out of this world.This game is far too quickly overlooked by many people - and the demo doesnt do it justice.The Story is brilliant too, and the technology trees are excellentley set up.For 10 bucks - u should buy two - one for u and one for ur friend!"
3,"A good book, but there are better ones","This book has a lot of questions and answers. Unfortunately, given the number of questions, quality is compromised. A better bet is the book ""Quizzing,"" which is filled with interesting trivia."
4,from what ive herd,most people doing a review from what i can tell havent even rode a dirtbike so they think this game is relistic well its not on this game there are no actual roots in turns the rythem section is the easiest and the preloading is bad but if you have only watched or never raced you would like this game (thanks to carmichael and stewart)
5,Awsome Game!,"I was really impressed with this game. After playing many other mx games in the past I was some what cautious of buying this one. I am glad I decided to. If you like mx in any way, you will love this game. The graphics are awsome in a way that only XBox can give! I am totally happy with this game and think that anyone would be!"
3,Nothing revolutionary for an MX game,"MX 2002 is definitely a fun game, but it isn't a particuarly ground breaking title.The game centers around a career mode. You start at an Amateur in the 125cc class and work your way up to the 125cc Pros and then the 250cc Pros. Along the way you can take part in freestyle competitions and tutorials to hone your skills.The tracks are varied and can be quite long, which makes for fun racing. However, the game as a whole is quite short. I was able to complete the game within 3 days and it doesn't offer much in the way of replayability because there are so few team/bike choices. Also, features such as qualifying races (and last chance qualifiers) are completely absent.Overall I found Supercross 2000 for the N64 much more enjoyable. In particular it had running commentary during the races and multiple camera views. MX 2002 has neither of these.I recommend renting it for a couple days of entertainment."
5,One of my favorite movies,I absolutely love this film. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it and I'd rather watch it most days before anything current.
5,Knowing How it Feels,"For a decade that begins with being ""Over the Hill,"" there is a negative connotation comes with being forty. It implies that 40 means ""old"". You may often be asking yourself, ""Where did the time go?"" Instead of looking ahead, as for the previous years, you may find your self searching back. Lonely and Confused you may wonder, ""Does anyone know how it feels?"" By reading Viorst's Book, I was motivated to look ahead instead of searching for the past. She made it feel as though there is still a hike to hump of the hill. Entusiastic about being forty instead of being depressed about middle-age, she explains how to cope with the every-day experiences of being forty. To best put it she makes you feel OKAY about middle-age!"
1,miserable quality of sound track – you can't understand whatever is said,miserable quality of sound track – you can't understand whatever is saidmiserable quality of sound track – you can't understand whatever is said
2,Stick with Fandorin,"Not one of his best. No character grabs one's interest, and trying to keep track of the many players with their multiple, many-syllabled, sound-alike names takes one right out of the plot. Much better to wait for the next Erast Fandorin novel. Take a pass 'til then."
4,"Warm hearted, old fashioned detective fiction.",This reminded me of the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency stories in the niceness of the heroine and its general warm heartedness. It does take a little bit of time to get going and you do need to pay attention to the names of the various characters.I found all the historical information to be pretty interesting . It was quite well written and I didn't really notice that it was a translation. At times it did seem a little contrived and maybe totted on the verge of being a parody but for the most part it had a decent storyline and was fairly realistic.
4,Great gift for a golfer,Got this for my step-dad who has a new found love of golf. He loved it. My husband thought it was hilarious too. A great gift.
4,Sweet,"Product shipped very quickly and in good condition. Only complaint was all the disks were loose shaking around inside the box, luckily nothing was scratched"
3,disapointed,"The final season doesn't contain the ""true"" ending as shown in the final manga volume. In that volume, Ranma's mother accepts her son's and husband's curse. It would've been nice if the writers included this ending. I've read every manga volume, watched every episode as well as the two movies and the OAV series. So many stories in the manga have been left out of the anime. One story in particular is about Ryoga's new girlfriend near the end of the manga. She knows his secret and still loves him. I wished that the entire manga series was written into the anime (look at Dragonball/DBZ for example).I only wonder what Rumiko Takahashi has to say about all of this."
2,Short but good,"Beware, this is closer to a short story than a novel. Nicely put together and gives you an overview of an alternative to the prescribed views."
4,How evil started,I thought this was a good book. The idea of Evil was very thought provoking to me. It all depends on one's belief of what is evil. It means different things at different ages in our lives. This book brought me back to thinking about church and what they tried to teach me and then I thought about the Indian ways I've been trying to learn. I finally had to discard all those thoughts and just read the book.
3,Fallen angels watchers and the origins of evil,"A very informative and interesting subject, but a caution is required in reading this book because it seems the author uses a lot of extra biblical literature to develop a lot of his theology. While extra biblical literature is interesting to read, it is only the bible that one can develop truthfully accurate theology ."
4,Comprehensive retelling,"Using multiple sources, the author does a good job of retelling the stories of the bible, and other sources. A good place to start."
5,Truly awesome!,"I had just begun to read about this message elsewhere,but this small book makes things so clear. What anamazing truth to read!"
2,An unfortunate result of self-publishing.,"The book begins under the pretext of compiling historical texts into a cohesive thread, unfortunately, it is poorly edited and the writing goes from modern language to middle english and back. There are obvious errors in historical alignment and zero references. One doesn't know if the information is compiled from the book of Enoch, Genesis or John.There is no index and it makes for a clever short story but fails in that it tells you that it compiles ""histories""."
5,Good lesson and really fun to read!,My son and I both like this story. He's 18 months old so I have to read it to him and I really enjoy reading it. The poetic style is fun and easy to read. It has a really good lesson. It's okay if you don't win all the time. And the artwork is great! It's really detailed and realistic looking. My son likes to point to all the characters. Very pleasent to look at. Buy this book! You'll love it!
5,Great Book,My 2 year old daughter loved this book so much we had to buy it to have forever. She really loves the colorful picture and the animals.
5,Mortal Combat,My sons and I have a great time playing this game...we enjoy the story mode as well and the 1-on-1 combat. This is a great game.
4,Very pleased,"Pro:-interactive motions for moves and fatalities.-huge roster and exclusive players, plus a fun creation mode.-lots of unlockables-variety of modes to keep the game fresh.Con:-special move motions restricted to 4 or 5 basic motions.-D-pad attacks a little ackward at first.-less features than other systemsI was pleased with this version for the Wii. The create a fatality is much more fun using motions. The create a character is a blast, nothing like ripping off heads as Neo from the Matrix or anyone you can imagine. I got used to the controls quickly, and friends playing this also caught on quickly. Lack of online is too bad, but there is plenty to do without online play."
4,Nephews loved this producy,I purchased this fame for my nephews and they loved the game. Shipping was fast as well. Will buy more video games during next season.
4,"Very good, but it has its flaws.....","This is a great game with a really good storyline and overall a fun game, but sometimes things get too repetitive in konquest mode and the fatalities are very challenging to do. The graphics are good,but somewhat unrealistic like when you rip a guys head of blood shoots out of his neck like a super soaker! Finally overall i strongly reccomend get this Game."
3,Mortal Kombat Armageddon,It seems to me a good video game and it is very fun for play it with your friends and family.
3,hubby's happy,"I bought this for my Hubby and son and they haven't stopped playing it. I had been searching all over our small town for a fighting game on Wii. Who would've known they are so rare on the Wii! Well a family friend said they had a classic Mortal Kombat game so I went to my reliable source Amazon. Sure enough I found it decently priced and available for immediate ship. So happy it got here in record time. Only down fall is adjusting to the little quirks of the game. Making sure both controllers are connected and live before starting the game is key and when you have a 5 year old running it all the time its hard to remember that little detail. Overall though, we're very happy with this game."
4,Amazing stuff!,"Love the graphics even-though in Xbox are much better. Very easy to use and play, it gives us the option to use wii remote or the classic control."
3,Average at best...,The game play is just fine and so are the graphics...I'm just not a fan of the controls. Too hard to do combos.
2,Horrible Controls,"The game itself is great, when you can control it. The Wii controls are horrible for playing this game, I would suggest using some of the other types on controls if you choose to buy this."
3,a bit violent,"This game is good for my husband and young adults , but not for kids 13 and under, this games contains lots of blood ..."
3,I get the wrong game?,"I buy Mortal Kombat Armageddon, the case and the CD is printed like Mortal Kombat Armageddon game but really is Motor Kombat, the car racing game.I'm very disappointed."
3,nice but...,"I like this game don`t get me wrong it could be refreshing and at the same time bring memories of the first titles released more than a decade ago. It features a couple mini games as you probably now by now like motor kombat which is kind of a Mario karting but with mortal kombat characters it`s fun!Now about the wii controls for fighting which is what interests the most to players well sure it`s easier to do the special abilities of every character but at the same time I find it harder to fight, a lot harder.For this reasons and I think the guys at midway understood that an arcade game needs some speed on buttons, you can also play with another controllers like the ""wii classic"" attachment or game cube controllers which I think it easier for fighting but less fun than with the wiimote."
1,HUGE Dissapointment! The graphics are worse then 10 yrs ago.,"I've been playing MK since it came out 10+ years ago.. I've played on Sega, Sega CD, Super Nintendo, N64, Playstation... and I have to say, of all the different iterations of this game, this is probably the worst, esp. given the fact that its built for the Wii, which should have excellent graphics.The game is cheap and you can tell they just put it out quickly to make a fast buck. The graphics are seriously worse then back on my Super Nintendo... Seriously, I'm stunned that the graphics are worse then 10 years ago! What the hell?This was a slap in the face, and a real disappointment, because I love MK!I would advise you to go buy the older version and get yourself a Nintendo before you waste your money here."
1,worse fighting game ever,bad graphic...bad control...no improvement from the old one. (even worse than the 1 st Mortal Kombat
1,DUMBIST GAME EVER!!!!!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS SO HORRIBLE !! The characters hardly do anything at all no special tricked out moves nothing this was such a big hype with nothing to back it up at all DO NOT WASTE your money trust me total rip off
3,not a match made in heaven,"Great game, but it was near impossible for me to know what i was doing with the chuck or remote. Fatalities were a joke, i went on youtube.com countless time to try to get the motions right, but was a massive fail each time. probably would have been much more enjoyable with a hand held controller. The side games are really fun and the currency system gives you something to do in between screwing up fatalities."
5,Fantastic single - great value for money,"I love Girl Thing. They never cease to amaze me. They've broken up, but they leave this brilliant single behind them. BMG dropped them on only their third single (this one), and it was such a shame. They were an excellent band, and I will miss them very much.Ok, onto the review. This CD has 4 songs on it: Young, Free and Happy radio edit, the album version (Which is slightly different), a new track named Girl Thing For Life and a song which is on their amazing debut album titled Sister Love.The radio edit is slightly shorter then the album version, but both are brilliant. Girl Thing For Life is pure genius. It is catchy and dancy and makes you sing and dance. Sister Love is excellent.Overall, the single is amazingly great. Girl Thing will be sadly missed, and this single proves they have talent. I hope they all do well solo. Buy this, as it will be a collector's item someday."
2,An equipment glossary with an editorial bias,"Professional Digital Photography was well organized and contained alot of information but seemed to be more an elaborate glossary for beginning photographers with too much space dedicated to past equipment overviews and not enough hands-on information concerning digital photography, scanning and output. The editorial style had a bias that was distracting:example,""...a microlab can process 8-10 rolls of film an hour and be operated by a highschool student with a nose ring."""
2,Smelly indeed! A real stinker.,This witty book is spoiled beacuase the smells impregnated into the pages do not have a long shelf life once opened. You can find better books than this if you want to find out about the subjects.
5,My dentist thanks you,I use this product daily. I like the fact that I can find refills easily.Thank you
1,Don't buy if you don't have good hands,"I am disabled and don't have good hand control. I have used the Reach Access Power Flosser for years very well. It died and was disappointed to find it wasn't made anymore. I tried this and and was very disappointed. Having to hold the power switch on was diffacult for me and I must have closly spaced teeth (never a problem with the Reach)because much of the time it wouldn't spin.Basically, if you don't have full use of your hands, don't buy.dale"
5,Grist for the Mill,"I first read this book so long ago in the 1970s. The details of the subject matter are so haunting and memorable. It is a most wonderfully insightful book. I have come back to it many times in my life. I think of it so frequently I have to go get it and read something in it. I follow Ram as much as possible. I saw him recently on ""Lunch with Bokara"" on Link TV. There is such a genuineness about him that grips me. It is a wonderful life to be a Spiritual Soul in a human body, not being deprived of either life while we are alive; yet not caring about this one when we lose the body, dropping it like a cloak. The connectedness of the spiritual and terrestrial realms of existence is sacred in itself."
3,Fine,I bought five of these for male classmates because Terry (nee Helen Koford) was in our class at Glendale High.
4,A different view of the early Republic,"A very detailed look at the political and legal fallout from the contentious election of 1800. Having read a fair amount of Amer. Hist., Ackerman covers in detail that I found illuminating- never count out the role of fortune in history is one of the lessons to take from his book. Be prepared for some fine legal wrangling in the later chapters!"
5,Calumet Umbrella Adapter with Hot Shoe Mount,"A very good quality stuff, feels solid to use to put flash in it. I would recommend anyone to use it."
4,"Pretty impressed, really","I think this is a great tool for the bag, somewhat of a Swiss army knife adapter. The little metal adapter portion flips over and gives you both 1/4-20 and a larger thread on the other side (sorry, don't know measurement of other thread, but its larger) This does adapt to a male shoe (like my road video mic) and is made of mostly metal construction. It also screws into my Smith Victor light stand, and has the post so I can fasten this to my light stand with out using the screw... bonus. Best cheap-o item I've purchased in a while. thx."
3,"Good Instructor, but not for me","Let me preface my review by saying that I own many fitness dvd's by the likes of Ellen Barrett, Denise Austin, Kathy Smith, TamiLee Webb, and Suzanne Bowen to name a few. I had read many glowing reviews about Karen Voight and so I decided to purchase her Ballet Body Sculpt through Amazon. Another thing that prompted me to buy this dvd was her use of a mini-ball. Unfortunately, this dvd is not for me and I'm going to have to return it. The pace is too fast and I lost interest within the first ten minutes of the workout.I watched the whole routine once before trying it and I must say that Karen Voight is a good instructor, but she's not a good fit for me!"
2,"yawn, yawn.....","If you own ""physique 57"" , save your money. All the exercises are taken out of physique 57 and incorporated in this dvd on a smaller scale.Very dissapointing nothing original.You will get more workout and toning from physique 57."
4,"Study, Reflection and Art","I worked through this book in 1994-5 when I was going through a very difficult transition in my life. The part that has stayed with me in the last 13 years is choosing to be thankful and grateful each day and writing what you are thankful for down.Between the spiritual discipline of thankfulness, the weeks of taking time in them morning and evening to pray through the Psalms, and the art and poetry in the book, I was able to come out of a dark period of my life when new appreciation for the small things each day and an increased observation of life and the world around me."
1,WARNING Christians DON'T BUY,"This book is ungodly...it has a bunch of New Age stuff in it...I went to Fuller Seminary in Seattle and this book was required to read by the teacher. I quit going to Fuller Seminary, they teach stuff required by the government in order to make money and a lot of the teachings at Fuller Seminary in Seattle teaches new age, Easter Philosophy not to teach about it, but stating Hinduism, Buddhism, and New Age TRUTH!. The teacher and the students (at least the class I was in) lets students promote homosexuality and that people are to accept homosexuality and help them promote it in the church. I Quit Fuller Seminary in Seattle...warning stay away from Fuller in Seattle."
3,is good!,the only flavor you may like is grape! read the instructions careful ..no shaking! you just stir in a class ...
3,meh on taste,"I've tasted everyone of these except the lemonade one (for which i hear is completely disgusting) and by FAR (REALLY FAR) the best tasting one is definitely the Green Apple,then i would say its the Orange one Next.. The rasberry one isn't horrible but its not the best.. i will say this though..as with all BSN products ,ESPECIALLY the N.0 explode series,that it gets the Job done like you wouldnt believe.. if you don't mind the taste of this one-as it is tolerable-then you are good to go..But i still would rather someone spend that $40 towards the better tasting ones out there. :)"
3,good stuff,it tastes great although i dont feel the effects of the NO part of this. i dont really last any longer than when i did before hand. but it is letting me up my weight. maybe i just need to up the intake.
1,Great... if you don't have plans to sleep for a while!,"I have been lifting for about 25 years and have never had a supplement mess me up as bad as this stuff did. Bottom line, I couldn't sleep for about 40 hours straight after taking one serving. After doing a little research I discovered that I wasn't the only person with this problem, but I was lucky. Some folks were messed up for quite a while longer. I have never had ill effects from any other supplement I've taken from BSN or energy supplements from other manufacturers for that matter. Definitely a buyer beware product."
2,Not like original,"Didn't notice anything resembling the pump it ought to have provided. No substantial increase in energy levels. At least I kinda liked the taste; its one saving grace, I guess."
4,Ehh,"No - Explode, is an ok powder mix drink. Taste is just really bugs me. Does some improvement with working out"
3,"Great product, bad flavor",NO Xplode is great but Blue Raspberry tastes bad. Go with Red or Green instead. I wouldn't workout without this anymore.
3,BSN N.O Explode is okay..,"First week it gave me really good pump and 2nd week, it was alright then i kept using it half way through the bottle, and it didn't really work for me. I tried out MP Assault, Vega Sport Pre-workout, Jack3D, and this. The best one so far was MP Assault but N.O. Explode was alright."
2,not good,no matter how much you take don last and the crash stay for longer i wish to return so is too expensive also
3,Great for the beginner,"I started working out with NO-EXPLODE 2 years ago and it worked ""Great"" but way to sweet for me then you take a major crash after workouts. NO-EXPLODE is great for the beginner and the cost is a real value for your money but as your workouts becomes more progresive and intense, you will eventually switch to another pre-work product. The ""ONLY"" thing I can say bad about NO-EXPLODE is it is very sweet, like drinking pure sugar."
1,No Xplode the worst pre-workout on the market,"After trying several pre-workout drinks, the No Xplode is by far the worst.No extra reps, loaded with fillers, the orange flavor is nasty.Really should be marketed as a laxative instead of a pre-workout."
4,great stuff,"dont take it to late it will keep you up all night , but bottom lines is it works stay away from orange it nasty ass hell ,1 scope works for me"
1,Boosts performance but dangerous side-effects,"It does boost energy, performance and strength for workouts. However it increases liver enzymes, increases estrogen (probably worse if you are in your forties and your liver cannot metabolize the spike in estrogen away quickly) and many other nasty and dangerous side-effects. If there were no ill-effects, this would be really great."
3,So So,"At first this product gave me plenty of energy and focus. It made me into a monster, and almost erased fatigue. After a couple of weeks it wasnt as powerful as i guess my body got use to it. The only REAL negative was the taste, it was HORRIBLE. I would gag after drinking it. Tasted nothing like fruit punch. Overall good product i would recommend"
5,"Great Stuff, Great Price",NoXplod is a fantastic product. You have to maintain a daily regimen of taking it though or it will give you a headrush each time you use it. Product came as described and undamaged
5,Love this stuff!!,"Absolutely love this stuff, taste ok & works great! I get such a rush on this, harder pumps & more endurance during my workouts without the crash. Will continue to buy this..."
4,Pretty good stuff,There is no doubt this will get you amp'd up for a good weightroom workout. I've tried it for cardio workouts but honestly got a little too jittery and chatty for my own comfort. In the gym though it allows me to throw some extra weight on and get a great pump.Like any caffeniated product though you'll more then likely develop an immunity to this and you'll need more scoops to get that lift. That's why its good to stop after you finish the tub and let your body get re-acclimated to life without it.
3,Decent product but a bit expensive.,"I like this product but 4 the $$$ I do believe the regular NO Xplode is just fine. There are not to many new ingredients in the 2.0 and the one I have been using now is the newer Hyper FX by BSN with fat burning support as well as DAA(D-Aspartic Acid) which helps with recovery as well as cycle support during and PCT. I believe the FX to be stronger than both NO Xplodes and I think I got 30servings 4 $15. Not bad and the Blue Raz flavor is great. It does contain 30% synephrine which gets u going but 4 some this product might b 2 much! Anyways Check out my other reviews on different supp's and u'll learn a lot and find the right one 4 urself! Thanx, Chris-"
3,questionable,I purchased after they took Jacked 3 D off the market. You will get a better pump but won't get much of an energy boost.
2,NASTY Stuff!,"I thought that BSN had solved all the world's problems when they came out with their Syntha-6 Protein Powder (which is absolutely delicious). Naively I made the assumption that the Wizards at BSN wouldn't allow any of their products to taste bad. Sadly that isn't the case. Yes, the product works. BUT AT WHAT COST? Honestly, I retch a little bit every time I think of drinking this. BUT I STILL DO IT, because I bought it. Also, it sometimes makes me throw up, or nauseous after a hard workout. Which is gross too. Basically... yuck. Come on BSN, where is the magic?"
1,No explode,The flavor was ok but overall the product wasnt what I expected. Ill go with 1mr or something next time.
4,Not bad,"Wasnt to bad. worked good, not sure why is was clumpy instead of it being a smooth powder like I've had before"
4,Does what it is supposed to,"I love this stuff! This is the second best flavor, orange is the best. Does its job though and does it well."
1,"For the flavor, I'd rather drink my own....","Works about average for products I've tried for the same purpose. If you can get past the most horrid flavor I've ever forced myself to endure then you are probably evil. I haven't tried the other flavors to compare or to say you should get this other specific flavor instead but Blue Raspberry is intolerable. I wouldn't drink it again unless if it was guaranteed to make me a god, which it isn't. So if you have no way to get a free sample of this flavor do yourself a favor and get a different flavor."
1,I don't understand the hype,"Let me start off by saying I am a very caffeine sensitive person. I don't drink coffee or soda and I leave caffeine to pre-workout drinks only. I know this product says it has over 200mg of caffeine in it... however, to me it feels like less than 50mg. It simply feels like I'm taking a placebo before I workout.I switched to this after running out of jack3d and taking a 2 week break from caffeine before my workouts. All I can say is I wish I never switched. Jack3d works amazingly compared to this. I will never purchase again."
3,Tastes like EWW!,"The taste is bad, kind of gets you hyper but I guess for the money its okay. I probably wont buy this again."
3,GREAT PRODUCT....for a time.,No matter what when you take this product you will crash. Almost like comming from a sugar rush except milder. It gives you great energy and helps focus...for a time. Eventually your body seems to adapt to it. The rush is so short but the crash is still their. So basically you will be working out then all of a sudden you are out of energy. So long story short. Buy 1 bottle see how you feel about it at end and see what you think about another bottle. I was on 2nd jar and flushed it because I really like the rush/taste but the crash was coming way to fast.
4,Definitely one of the Top 3 Pre Workout Supplements,"Good stuff. I've been using NO Xplode off and on for a few years now. Overall, it is a pretty effective product. In my opinion, it ranks up there with Hemo Rage Black and Neurocore, but NO Xplode is probably more popular than either of those pre workout supplements."
2,It gives you energy,That being said the energy is like that of a Red Bull. It made me jittery and didn't set well with my belly. After my work out I puked a puke that would rival the exorcist. Needless to say I never took this product again. I love BSN's Syntha 6 though.
3,n.o xlpode 1.0 is better,does not give as much energy and pumps as the original n.o xlode.. but it might work for some other people i will be going back to the original n.o which is perfect.
1,Not what is advertised. Don't order this. IT IS NOT THE 2.0 VERSION.,"I ordered this product believing it would be the newest formula of N.O.-Xplode. When it arrived, it is the old version. This product is not the 2.0 version. Don't order from this supplier until they can fix the problem. I also paid about $10 more for this product over the regular because it is advertised as the 2.0 version, which it is NOT. Very UNHAPPY about this. Amazon needs to be more accurate with their products and who they do business with."
4,Works great but can make you jittery,This stuff is awesome. 30 min after I take it I feel like I could run a marathon. Be careful when taking this product though as it can make you jittery. Take only 1 scoop for the first couple of days and then slowly add more. I stopped taking it for a while and then decided to take 2 scoops. Bad idea!!!
5,ALL THE WAY!!,"I love noexplode. Have friends that told me about how they used it over seas while in the military etc, and I had been buying it locally however it was between 60-90$ for the same amount when I can purchase it here for less than half the price. I love this stuff it makes me feel great while getting the best out of my workouts, even when it's just having kids around the house!!"
4,NO-Xplode,"No-Xplode is great for pre workout but it bothers me that I can't eat anything beforehand. It is like drinking two cups of coffee before a workout, it does great for a weights session."
5,Great,Best flavor of no-xplode hands down. My favorite pre-workout drink. BSN as a whole has a solid product line and the flavor is unbeatable
5,Good Stuff,I love using this stuff before working out. Works out great. Also the Raspberry taste good too.
2,disgusting,Don't get the blue raspberry. It's nasty. And i've downed some disgusting protein before. It's just bitter and disgusting. I couldn't even finish the supply I got and i'm mad that i wasted the money.
1,makes you fat!,I gained a lot of belly fat and got little energy with this product. Plus it is highly dangerous and full of fillers and magnesium and maltodextrin
1,TASTE HORRIBLE but.......,"The product is great. I've used it and liked other flavors. Watermelon flavor is anything but that. Think of old candy melted in with cough syrup and add a something you'd find in a barn. Sound gross? well, there ya go! Try other flavors."
1,I've been robbed,I paid for the xpolde 2.0 and i got the old one. Please i want to know how i can get my money back. Ive been waiting 3 weeks for this product and now I cant start taking it.
1,Aspartame,"Contains Aspartame, a know poison, you would be stupid to purchase it, regardless if it works or not. Artificial flavors as well. Forget this one and go with something safer and much more natural that will not degrade your internal organs."
4,Awesome but not at first,To put it plainly I love this product NOW... But not in the beginning and really not for the first couple weeks. I had diarrhea so bad it sucked hahaha. After some research I found that this is common and learned of ways to use the product more efficiently. For example smaller doses and don't take it with creatin and don't dare drink any coffee before or after and any caffeine oriented drink. Also that the side effects will soon lessen. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not five. Hope this helps
5,gives you the boost you want,"Well, this is my 11th jar, NO-Xplode works great beofre you hit the Gym. It gives you the punch you need when you're lifting weights or doing cardio. You'll never get tired. I get great results after every work out. I recommend this to anyone who needs that extra energy and take your workout to the next level. I usually get extra reps when I take this."
1,"Jittery, eventual puking. DO NOT BUY","It was great at first to make you rady to workout, and you could actually feel your blood pumping. It was a little bit of a weird sensation. Both my roommate and I used this for months, and by the 4th month, we had both gotten very sick because of it. all guildelines were followed that NO-Xplode gave us. Multiple peopel I know had this same problem where they would be brought to basically the level of food poisoning after taking this. Do Not BUY. The jitteriness started coming more than a feeling of being ready to work out, and this has been connected to alot of health issues. Wish I never took it. DO NOT BUY!"
2,Not for me,"I have to take 3 scoops for me to feel the effect. I also hate the fruit punch favor, too much coloring. Finished the whole container without seeing much of a different."
4,Good if Cycled,Yes this is the best out there you will see improvements quickly but after one container you might want to take a break or switch to NANO VAPOR or any other N.O (NITRIC OXIDE) because NO XPLODE like any other N.O supplements will decrease its efficiency within 30 to 45 because you body will get use to it.
3,Works well only with the right sized avacado,"I am an avacado fan. So, when I came across this tool, I thought, ""aha... something to save me time in the kitchen"". Well, that's only partially true.If I have an avacado the same width as the avacado slicer, then all is right with the world. A simple motion of pressing into the avacado half and pulling towards me, and I end up with evenly spaced slices. What could be simpler or quicker!Alas, there is a downside. If your avacado is smaller in width than the slicer, your in for a messy situation. The slicer no longer slides through the avacado, it gets caught on the tough skin (it is wider than the avacado in this situation) and the once even slices are now mashed and part of the avacado peel sticks to the slicer. I spent more time cleaning up after the slicer and my slices were no longer uniform. In this case, I would have been better off using my knife."
4,Avicado slicer,"The slicer works fabulously. However, we recently noticed another brand slicer that also has a tool to remove the seed; consequently, we gave the slicer 4 stars."
4,My two box turtles like it too!,"Had a ceramic heater light I was using until it burnt out. While looking for a replacement came across this bulb and since it was a good deal bought it. My turtles are mostly indoor creatures since outside is way too dangerous with ants, cats, and constant falling avocados...but they need sunlight to be healthy. So this light does the trick. It is not very warm but they did bask in it so I guess the rays were good. Still ended up getting another ceramic heat bulb for them for night time (plus we run the AC at 60- 24/7 so it is a bit chilly!). Overall another good purchase through Amazon!"
5,A Fine Script Lettering Guide,"I have had a copy of this book for over twenty years. When I was apprenticing to become a professional tattooer I memorized fonts out of it, practicing them repeatedly, until I knew them by heart. Tonight I was showing the book, on Amazon, to an apprentice at the shop, and was surprised that there are no reviews. It is a simple and easy book to learn from and I highly recommend it. I've tattooed many a script name, or phrase, on customers, with fonts learned from this very book."
3,"Good ideas, but know your German!","I purchased this product to obtain some new coaching ideas for 8-year-old children. At this age, if you have evening practices, you will not have much time to keep their attention, so I was looking for good soccer drills that improve player skill but also keep the child's interest and attention.This DVD did provide some good ideas and examples overall. I don't think it is worth the price, however. 2/3 of the language is in German, with no subtitles. When a drill was not going well, and had to be stopped for an explanation, I could not understand what the instructor was saying.Also, too much time was spent with 3 on 3, and 4 on 4 scrimmages. Watching a 4 on 4 game for 10 minutes is not my idea of obtaining new ideas.I did like the emphasis on awareness on the field, and using both feet. Something very few coaches teach, even today.Overall, if you speak English and German and are looking for good soccer coaching ideas, this is a worthwhile purchase."
4,Rocktron,"Really good efx - clean sound! Love using it live live or in studio... Lot's of presence, GREAT potential to create... for those of us who want to..."
2,skin type may very,"I am a medium to lite skined black woman. and i have tried many produces. this one is low on the potency side, however it did fade the specific spots i put it on by 40%-45%. you may think that's a lot but over a 6 to 8 week period it evens out. mainly my arms and upper back. my white friend tried it after i told her how it worked for me, and it too made her a bit reddish (like the woman in the prev review). she is somewhat fair skined. so i am making a huge assumption by saying it may very on skin type. but that has been my experience."
5,"Wonderful performance, great price!","The young Norwegian Leif Ove Andsnes should now be familiar with lovers of classical piano music, having established himself as one of the world's premier pianists. This new release from Virgin Classics is a compilation of previously released recordings of compositions for piano by his countryman, Edvard Grieg. There are so many fine recordings of the Grieg Concerto that yet another may seem redundant. Yet Andsnes, with satisfying accompaniment from the Bergen players, renders a wonderful account - perhaps not the ultimate recording (if there is such a thing) but certainly worth having. The clincher for this release is the Sonata. It is simply stunning and is a must have for any lover of Grieg's music. The smaller pieces will not disappoint either. And to top it all, this release is at an absolute bargain price. So much great music, superbly performed by one of the world's best at a snip of a price. It is a 'must buy'!"
5,"His guitar did more than ""talk""","Robbie Basho has been lost to too many. This was a man whose fingers could turn a six string into a sitar. He could invoke the Spirit of American Indian princesses, so they would spin on your turntable. And this CD is all that's left for those he didn't hear the glory. It's as wonderful compilation. Some of his best work. If you think John Fahey and Leo Kotke are guitarists, then you need to listen to Basho and meet the Ravi Shankar of the guitar."
4,"Not very accessible, but quite creative","I don't listen to Robbie Basho very often, but I respect him enormously. He does, as other reviewers have indicated, have an uncanny ability to make his guitar sound like a sitar. Technically, he was virtually without peer. Compositionally, he was inconsistent. At his best, he flowed evenly between meditative ragas and oddly pleasing dissonance. At his worst, he sounded like he was just banging away randomly on his guitar. For those looking for a more accessible blending of eastern and western sounds, Sandy Bull played a more accessible blend (in fact, several pieces that he explicitly called, ""Blends"") which is not as technically impressive, but is far more fluid, and Ry Cooder and VM Bhatt's collaboration (A Meeting By the River), while I find it a bit boring, may be more to the liking of those who like their music dissonance-free. Incidentally, occasionally, Basho tried to sing, which was a dreadful mistake, but those tracks can be skipped."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I ordered this CD after reading the two other reviews and was extremely disappointed; difficult to explain but it sounds like this guitarist doesn't really know what he wants to play, not improvising but hesitating all the time and it's quite annoying; the guitar technique is not really there either and on top of that the recording quality is awful. I must add that I'm rarely negative; sorry this time."
1,All Thumbs Down,"Whilst Leo Kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and John Fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers, Robbie Basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs. That this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by Kottke or Fahey (or Peter Lang) is puzzling to say the least. But, credit where credit's due: it's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant."
4,Stephen King - eat your heart out!!,"A great book, I've read it four times since I bought it in 1992. A chilling horror book with an equally chilling message. A must-have for fans of ""The Stand"" and other apocalyptic-type novels"
1,total cheapness,"Waited for years for this in hardcopy at a reasonable price. Bought it, and the book quality stinks. NO EXCUSE. Yes a review should also consider what it is printed on. The cheapest quality of paper, and light printing. The authors are the best in the field, and have a lot of great information, but someone tried to cut too many corners and came out with one cheap quality of a book."
4,A Great Book With a Fairy Tale Ending,"""WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME"" IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS THAT YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN.WHEN I STARTED READING THIS BOOK I DIDN'T PUT IT DOWN FOR HOURS AND IT ONLY TOOK ME A FEW DAYS TO READ IT. IT'S ABOUT A GIRL WHO GETS PREGNANT AT A YOUNG AGE. SHE WAS FORCED TO LIVE ON HER OWN WITH HER CHILDREN. SHE NEVER GAVE UP HOPE OF BECOMING SOMEONE. THIS BOOK I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO TEENAGE MOTHERS. TEENAGE MOTHERS WOULD FIND THAT THEY COULD RELATE TO TAMMY AND TO HER SITUATION.THE ONLY THING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE END. IT WAS LIKE A FAIRY TALE ENDING. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF TAMMY WOULD HAVE STAYED WITH HASSAN AND LIVED A HAPPY LIFE TOGETHER. SO MAKE SURE YOU PICK UP THIS BOOK, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
5,I Can Relate,"Hi...I am a single working mother of two boys....& I seriously could relate to so many things Tammy went thru in this book! However, I can also see where Hassan was coming from too...I just want to give TWO THUMBS UP to Undra for writing a great story, that indeed made me shed a few tears!!!!!! I can't wait to read BACKFIELD IN MOTION!!!!!!God Bless,JC Cutee"
5,AMAZING!!!,"I had been told about this book, but kept putting off reading. I am so glad I finally pick this book up and couldn't put it down. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it or thinks that they cannot overcome the daily trials and tribulations that we all go though. Undra E. Biggs, congratulations on a job well done. I look forward to more work from you. Keep up the good work."
4,Great Read,I truly enjoyed reading this book. It is a quick read and has a good flow. The characters and their situations are believable. I found myself unable to put the book down because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. I became engrossed in the lives of Tammy and Hassan and all their drama! This is a must read!
3,NOT BAD,"THIS BOOK IS NOT BAD AT ALLTHE BOOK IS ABOUT A YOUNG GIRLWHO MADE SOME BAD MOVES IN HERLIFE AND ENDED UP WITH TWO KIDSAT A YOUNG AGE, THEN HER MOTHERTELLS HER SHE HAVE TO LEAVE, NOTKICKING HER OUT BUT MAKING HER BECOMEA WOMAN BEFORE SHE IS READY, SO SHE MOVES OUTSHE GETS ON WELFARE AND MOVE TO THE PROJECTSWHERE SHE MEET A YOUNG HUSTLER-PLAYER- AT FIRSTALL HE WANT IS A WAM BAM THANK YOU MAM BUT HE CATCHSOME FEELINGS FOR THIS GIRL, BUT HE HURTS HER TOO MUCHAND THE WORST PART HE GETS HER PREGNANT AND AT THE SAMETIME HE GETS HIS BABY MOTHER PREGNANT, THIS BOOK HASALOT OF DRAMA MORE LIKE 3.5 I JUST HATE THE FAIRYTALEENDING."
5,Oh great!,"I found this book my my Aunt and Uncle's boat when I was down there for the week end and I couldn't put it down! I even went out and bought the book to finish on the plane ride home! (which I did) Not only was the book great and so moving, but Undra Biggs is such a nice woman. I'm glad she got her book published and that it was so well embraced. I've also heard a bit about a second book and I can't wait to see if it's true!"
4,A true to life story,"that mirrored my own. As a native of Trenton, NJ transplanted to Los Angeles 20 years ago, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME took me back home in a serious way. Not only did I see myself in Tammy when I was a teenage mother at 16, but the references to the locale, specific streets and riding to Philly made me homesick. Undra has done a wonderful job of smashing the stereotypical idea that all teenage mothers are ignorant and all drug dealers are heartless. Smart people making dumb choices happens everywhere and Undra Briggs successfully makes everyone cheer when the situations gets better. I look forward to more from this talented author."
4,A Must Read!,I recieved this book in the mail today and I already finished reading it. This book was excellent and the characters were so real to life. I read this book in 1 day I couldn't put it down. This sistah is from my hometown and she made me very proud of her. Keep doing what you're doing Undra and I wish you much success.
2,Nothing exciting,"I put this book down several times because the main character seemed to be in a never-ending cycle of making the same mistakes in the name of love...or shall we say sex (probaly the best part of the book). When she finally makes a good life-changing decision, she almost renigs on that. I was a little disturbed by this character but I will give it 2 stars since it did arouse some type of emotion."
4,Nice pictorial reference,"This book's strength is its pictures - realistic representations of dry California landscape plants. I would use it as a ""brainstorm"" book for getting ideas on which species to use in a particular landscape. The notations for each species are also helpful. Definitely one for the library."
1,the clean smell is gone,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND MY MOST FAVORITE SCENT, CALGON TURQUOISE SEAS. I'VE BEEN SEARCHING SINCE IT WAS DISCONTINUED. I ORDERED FOUR BOTTLES AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. IT WASN'T THE REAL STUFF OR IT WAS TOO OLD AND IT SMELLED LIKE PLAIN RUBBING ALCOHOL. $120.00 DOWN THE DRAIN AND IT'S NONREFUNDABLE SINCE IT'S A FRAGRANCE. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!I'M SO DISPLEASED WITH BEING RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!"
5,Turquoise Seas Best Fragrance Ever,"Calgon Turquoise Seas is my favorite fragrance of all time. I can't believe how many compliments I get from something that is so inexpensive. People tell me that I smell so clean. Or they are standing next to me and say ""it smells wonderful in here"". And you cannot overdo. It is light and fresh. I live in the desert and I love this spraying this product on all year long.I dumped all of my designer fragrances for this one that makes me and the people who are near me happy."
5,Calgon Body Mist Turquoise Seas,This is one of my favorite scents. Very fresh and clean. I get tons of compliments on this scent. I love it!!!!
5,Refined selection,"The twenty-three tracks of this splendid Music Club compilation have the ""crème de la crème"" of Bethelem's female cool jazz vocals in the fifties. Highlights are rare tracks by Marilyn Moore who exactly emulates Lady Day in ""Trouble is a man"", ""Is you is or is you ain't my baby?"" and ""I cried for you""; some early Nina Simone's studio performances; three Helen Carr's records and a surprisingly soft Carmen McRae in her beginning. But brightness goes on with the others - Audrey Morris, Chris Connor, Julie London, Jerri Winters, Betty Roche. Is it or is it not a ""dream team""? Don't miss"
1,Broken,"A rainbow umbrella and pencils were all my 4 year old wanted for Christmas. I live in Southern California. This umbrella lasted a total of four uses before one of the spokes tore throught the fabric. It looks lovely, but not very durable."
2,lasted a week,But that was all I expected. Fabric pulled away from the edges and I had to toss it lest my children poke theirs (or my) eye out.
3,"Well, if you like the cocteau twins . . .","From what I've been able to find out, this album was released in 1993 by eden records. There's approximately 61 minutes of music here.The trackist is as follows:1. song for her2. rivulets and violets3. field of flowers4. dancing dreams5. holding you6. dreaming of you7. hazy drops8. your smile9. heartbeat10. paperchain stories11. thoughts from afar12. jisel13. serenity14. frosty morningThey also released a 2nd album - Promise - on 5 Minute Walk Records.PROS -Good production values.Sounds a lot like late-80s Cocteau Twins: think Victorialand or Moon And The Melodies.CONS -Sounds a lot like late-80s Cocteau Twins: think Victorialand or Moon And The Melodies. I'm just sayin'."
1,Don't buy LG products,"My RC 897T DVD/VCR Recorder just died after only 8 months. The tuners LG use are shoddy and last just enough to make the warranty mostly useless.They use Korean labor to exploit the extreme poverty and it shows.As for Customer Service. Despite having a warranty and determining that my DVD recorder was a lemon (poorly made swindle) she told me to call a local repair shop whose phone number she supplied. Of course I'd have to pay for the repair.When I called the repair shop it turns out they only repair TVs.Google ""LG sucks"" and browse through the over 1 1/2 million hits you'll get.Avoid LG like the plague."
1,Piece of Junk - Shame on you LG,"I paid $199 for this, thinking it was the best player around at the time short of blu-ray. A few months into it, it doesn't accept any DVD, even the one's it recorded.Of course the warranty has expired. I will never buy another LG product in my lifetime."
3,Workaround for copy protection,"I was not happy to see this machine wouldn't let me record from a standard cable channel (National Graphic channel). I got a message telling me the TV program was copy protected. I searched and found a fix! You enter a service mode by holding down the channel UP and DOWN buttons on the player simultaneously for several seconds until you get a service menu on the TV screen. You'll see a list of two digit numbers/letters. Change the second digit on the fourth entry by pressing the down button on the circular button on the remote exactly 8 times! You save the change and restart the player. I was then able to record! Woo hoo :) Write down all the original settings before you make any changes or you may want to hang yourself if you mess up and ""brick"" your machine! Also, I e-mailed LG and they are sending me a CD with the latest software for the player. Apparently they made some changes."
1,Fails over time,"I bought it because it was priced well and had the HD upconvert feature. Recording was no problem - no issues there. My problems were with playback. The player began showing the alternate language subtitles on store-purchased movies. I could not turn OFF this feature - it had a mind of it's own. The last straw was skipping from chapter to chapter - in random order, again on store-purchased movies. This piece of junk now resides on the garbage, where it belongs!!!"
1,Three Dual Layer discs and 18 hours wasted,"The definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over with the same result but expecting something different. In this case it was expecting that this unit could successfully create a dual layer DVD of my favorite TV shows. I bought this dual layer recorder so I could get as many of the shows as possible on a disc. I was successful only three times. But the last three attempts have ended with an unreadable disc after about 6 hours of ES recording time. With no warning and plenty of disc space left, all of a sudden it just fails to read the disc. Frisbee.The only reason it is not in a thousand tiny pieces is that it plays DVDs flawlessly. Just don't plan on recording any dual layer discs."
1,New DVR is junk - Multiple Problems,"I'll keep this short - I bought this DVR just before the decision by the industry to use BlueRay. That said, I decided to delay buying a BlueRay until the day the LG gave up the ghost. Well with mixed emotions, that day has arrived sooner rather than later. About 3 months ago I noticed the display was going bad, no biggie just annoying. Soon after that I noticed that the unit would no recognize standard DVD blank media. Eventually by cleaning media and multiple tries it would accept a disk. Very annoying. However the latest issue is that the unit will suddenly and intermittently not play standard music CDs. Cleaning doesn't help. That's the proverbial straw. Time to ditch the nearly brand new DVR for a new a BlueRay or Playstation."
2,"noisy fan motor, not reliable",I bought one of these about year ago and it stopped reading most movie disks within 3 months. I had a new playback unit installed under warranty. 3 months later the cooling fan motor started making an awful racket and stops only when it is allowed to make racket for 5min. or so and then tap it. LG started out making good products but now it appears they have gone the way of most corporations today letting greed override their commitment to quality.
1,WORST DVD PLAYER AND RECORDER EVER!!!!,We purchased this dvd recorder at bestbuy and it is awful. It takes so long to even load a dvd and sometimes will freeze and you will actually have to disconnect the power to it and then reconnect. We normally purchase everything sony but this looked more sleek and would read memy cards for a slideshow of pictures. I would not recommend this to anyone EVER. To go back to a scene you have to do it all by remote. I will never again buy LG.
1,Stinks!,"It is stuck in the 480i, 480p mode and won't switch to 1080i to watch DVD's. The representatives at LG say it's the TV setting, but this is just not the case.The TV is a Sony 46"" LCD with HDMI hook-up. It is very frustrating. It would be a good idea if you could check this feature out at the store before purchase."
2,No Illustrations,"Don't be fooled by the lovely cover. This is a geometry book with no illustrations. I found it quite dense, with a formula in nearly every second sentence. I think it requires quite a bit of preparation to understand and provides no intuition whatsoever. Not for the faint of heart."
2,What is prerequisite before reading this book?,"I bought this book a week ago and spent one and half hour for quick overview.I'm studying intermediate Calculus with linear algebra.Well, my impression was it's very difficult to read.There are very few examples with solution, all the context written without diagrams."
3,More Synth oriented Pinhas,"I really liked this cd (except for the track about west side, NY, which is a pop oriented song and doesn't really belong with the rest of the cd) and enjoyed it's more keyboard, synth drenched approach (as opposed to the more synth & Gt + drums of Heldon, which i also love). Recommended but don't start here... you should have the Heldon and Pinhas best works first."
1,Not wide!,The cleat looks nice and sturdy but it is not a wide cleat at all. It wasted my time and money to ship it back. For that give it a zero rating!
5,"Wide Soccer Cleats, Yes!","My son has wide feet, and I was very happy to find these cleats. I ordered him the same size as he wears in New Balance sneakers, 4W, and they fit! They are light and he says they're comfortable. No break in period. We would order them again."
3,Not really wide width,"I bought these for my son, since he needs wide shoes to fit him comfortably, but these were really not wider than other shoes. Very disappointed."
4,"Wide, Comfortable, But not sturdy","Bought these for my 16-yr old with wide feet. They were comfortable and fit wonderfully, but JUST made it to the end of one season when they started to split away from the soles just before his last game.Disappointed they didn't last longer, but at least they weren't expensive!"
2,So-So,I bought this hoping for a better album than it turned out to be. It's more my preference than the CD or singer. I just wasn't that big a fan in the end...
4,Exceptionally wide emotional and expressive range,"Rich, full and well-balanced recording, to match the brilliance of the performances. There are no finer readings of either work.Iwaki and Melbourne orchestra present the complete ""Miraculous Mandarin"" ballet, not just the suite, as coupling for the ""Concerto for Orchestra."" The recording is exellent, spacious and full, and the playing is finely pointed but is often too well-mannered for Bartok, lacking something in fierceness and excitement."
1,More 'Useless' than 'Irreverent',"Wow. Bad. Really bad. Not worth the paper it's printed on - which isn't much - nor the time I wasted reading reading it - also not much. I'd cite specific examples, but I literally threw the book away within fifteen minutes of finishing it."
1,Save your money,"This would have been an interesting book idea if it had been written seven or eight years ago. As it is, there is little substance here, just a lot of noise about the obvious problems with most advertising today - misguided and pre-tested to the point of gum with the flavor chewed out of it.Zyman's own career is a product of big advertising budgets. His lack of experience building brands any other ways shows. As such, this book lacks specific advice about non-traditional marketing that comes from personal experience.If you're looking for a books that can help you find a new approach to marketing, this isn't it. Save your money."
4,A studio version would have got 5 stars,"Better Late has some of HTM's finest material. The 4 track recording doesn't do justice to the material, but I'm glad it exists. Songs like ""Footwork"", ""Shadow Shaping"" and ""While Chrome Yellow Shine"" are excellent example of what this band had to offer. Kit had remastered the original mix tape and this release is much better than the original vinyl release was.Happy The Man reformed in 2000 with the Crafty Hands lineup (minus Kit Watkins) and new product is expected shortly."
3,to cool!,yes! I am Cheryl from Jo'Momma'sSteak&Seafood I'm so glad to know you are doing it! I was your waiter when you where practing. At club 66. I am a realist and i checked out your sample to cool. I hope life will bring you all you hope for! And much more.
4,Modern Ugly Duckling,"If you love Big Girl by Danielle Steel, you'll love Red by Erica Spindler. Before she was a best-selling thriller author, she was in romantic suspense. Like Big Girl, this deals with loving yourself for you who are, and it doesn't know what anyone else thinks. It's also about fashion, photography and modeling. Becky Lynn Lee is poor and ugly from Mississippi, who comes from a broken home and a group rape, when she escapes to California for a new life. Jack Gallagher wanted recognition from his father, when his threats his other son better. Both rage and fury brings Becky and Jack together in California, as they work together, and take on the world, with tons of obstacles in the way. When they fall in love, things are complicated, as they are thrown for a loop, as the years fall by. In the end, they let go of the past and move on. What a beautiful story!"
4,"Very good book, but be careful readers-IT'S A REPRINT","This is a great read and the other commenters have covered the reasons why. I'm adding this review to WARN READERS THAT THIS IS A REPRINT of a 1995 book with a new cover. It drives me crazy that publishers are so money hungry they won't disclose that fact and long-time readers like myself end up buying the book a second time.Still a great book, but if I'd just looked through all my shelves of books (which would have taken hours I don't have), I'd have seen that I already had it."
4,Great,"I liked the story. It's kind of an old times fairy tale, ''of a girl coming from nowhere and becoming someone in the city of dreams.'' Liked."
2,Not so great!,I have read many of Erica Spindlers books and have enjoyed them. I read the reviews on Amazon.com and thought I'd try it. I was very disappointed!!! I usually read 2-3 books a week. It was an easy book to get into but went down hill from there. Too many story lines and not a smooth flow. I will continue to read Spindlers books but will research it much better next time.
4,Enjoyable author,"I always enjoy reading books by this author, but this book surpasses any that she has written; very hard to put down and keeps you in suspense. Look forward to reading more books by this author."
2,Boring compared to her other books,"The first book I read by Erica Spindler was ""Killer Takes All"" which got me hooked on her writing. I started reading any book of hers I could find but I tend to shy away from a book that's more than seven or eight years old. ""Red"" is not a murder mystery much to my dismay. It's reads more like a Harlequin Romance and I found it to be way too long for the story content. Girl is unhappy; girl leaves small town for big city; girl makes it big and meets the love of her life. It was written nearly 17 years old and I didn't really care for it but it was readable. If I don't like a book I'll just stop reading it but I was able to finish this one. If I could give it 2 1/2 stars I would but two stars will have to do."
4,Spartan Simplicity Sweetness,"Unplugged and acoustic music, for me, is hard to groove to without pushing up the bass or playing only when I need a beat for a rant. When I first got Viento de Agua, I shelved it after not connecting with the sparcity of the sound. Unknowingly someone put it in the auto cd player and drove around not realizing it was this cd that I did not like. I love these types of surprises, especially when I am arrogant and dismissive. As the cover indicates, this is a craft by one man and great drum battery back up."
5,Hellbilly at it's best,"This is a prime example of hellbilly music. The band is great and tight, oh wait, that's not a band it's only one man Scott H. Birham himself. The music is rough and raw, and as the sticker on the album states, best when played very loud. Really, this album, along with his first album, are worth picking up no matter what kind of music you like. He's probably the only guy capable of challenging Hank Williams III for his position as the badest country boy you'll ever meet."
2,Hmm.,"I am a real beginner so this review should be taken with some caution.I do not like this book for many reasons. One of them is that it is not updated. No chapter numbers at bottom of pages. Metaphors that I can't relate to i.e., the actual ""bus"" on page 152. ""...no one can get off the bus until it reaches the station."" Then later, ""You can drop a single passenger off at 32 different destinations...""I am a Mac user and it became annoying that the windows keys were combined with the mac keys. She'd say you don't have to use this download, but then the only explanation would be for that specific download. Index at the back was insuficient. She gives frequent and great tips; however, they are not listed in the table of contents, making it harder to find them again.The good things include nice color images. Pages are clearly laid out with good spacing."
3,"Good book for beginners, not for people with more experience","I found the book helpful at times and learned some things that I didn't know before, but I was largely not the target audience for this book. If you are relatively adept at using a computer or already have some experience with Pro Tools, then you're probably better off with another book."
5,"Easy, fun and informative","I admit that I hate to read a manual.I am a visual learner: I can watch someone else operate, say, Final Cut Pro and get the general grasp of the work environment.If I have to wade through text, it doesn't seem to click as easily.Having read several books on Pro Tools as well as countless instructional web pages, I was still struggling with my Pro Tools LE system.That's where Gina Fant-Saezs' book comes into play.I took a chance and spent the money.And it was money well spent, for someone with my learning curve.Easy to use, fun to read and plenty of visuals.Where other books explained Pro Tools in word, Gina's book augmented the text with excellent images.I highly recommend ""Pro Tools for Musicians and Songwriters"" for beginners as well as those who need something more than just words on pages."
5,a life-saver...,"Recently I enrolled in a music production course I never should have even considered, but I had no idea at the time how far over my head it was going to be. However, not being someone who gives up easily on challenges, it never occurred to me to bail. Instead I purchased Gina's book. I spent a couple of weeks working with it night and day, drilling through it, step by step. By the time I was done, I was exhausted, but happy! I had made a NICE recording for my class. I went on to complete a second, more ambitious project, which turned out well, and I successfully completed the course. More important, I am confident about tackling my next major project, the production of a complete album for my band. Thanks, Gina, for a well-thought-out and cogent work. I couldn't have managed without it."
2,Out dated,The book starts out great. But some of the material is out dated. Gina states there are updated chapters on line witch there are up to chapter 6 then that's it. From reading post at Peachpit books web sight (that contains updates) it's been almost two years nothing past chapter 6. your at the point in the book wear the updates are necessary. Well I will say I learned some useful information but I would consider it about a $10 book
2,Not for everyone,"This is a book of examples and exercises so don't expect to look up a particular function or problem that you are having, the Table on Contents is not up to that job. Again this is a book of simple examples and exercises directed to beginners that need to be lead completely from scratch but I found the text too drawn out and confusing with such items as references to a real bus to illustrate a mixer. The items that I was interested in were noted in the text that they would be covered later but no reference as to where in the text they would be covered. Obviously not a book for me, I have read and seen better."
1,Clueless on the Silk Road,"This is the worst book about Central Asia I've ever read. There are annoying factual errors on every other page. Even the title of the book is erroneous. The author travels north from China south into India and simply cuts across the east-west routes of Marco Polo/Silk Road. This is an annoying, useless book by a clueless author."
4,Wonderfully book for connoisseur's!,"This book is a great addition to any cigar enthusiasts book collection. It is a short, enjoyable read that has wonderful illustrations and pictures. It is filled with fun facts and takes a light approach to educating the reader on all the intricacies of the world of cigars. I would recommend this book to any one who is interested in learning more about cigars or just wants to further enhance their library."
3,Hopeful.,"I really enjoyed her first book better, Rising Moon. This book was kind of slow for me. It was really action based and not enough love for me. I'm hoping the next book will be better. The sex scenes were alot better in the first book too."
2,Too much of the same thing,"I will have to say I was disappointed in the book, maybe if I had read the previous book it would have helped. I felt the story line was thin and too much sex which was every other page, how much does an author need to stress one trait?My opinion is that the author could have developed some of the characters in this book more, for instance Kade and Kellen. I did like the character Misha who wasn't your typical character in love and his end was quite creative; the letter towards the end was a nice conclusion between Misha & Riley.I'm not sure I will continue on with this series."
2,A little disappointed.....,"I have read every Keri Arthur book, and was a little disappointed in this one. It could have been so much better. I like sex, but there is too much casual sex w/ too many partners for my taste. The chemistry w/ Quinn should have been further explored. Just b/c Riley is a wolf doesn't mean she has to sleep w/ every person she comes across. I am not too excited about the next book. I wouldn't waste my hard earn money on this book - get it from the library b/c it is not that good."
4,Amazing seconds,"Riley Jenson is back and fighting as hard as she was in the first one. In kissing sin we get to watch Riley grow into who she is becoming some more and learn more about Quinn, Liander, Rhoan, and Jack. Some new introductions to Kade (a horse shifter) who was captured at the same place Riley was, but they escape and we journey with them through new trials and journeys. Every character brought into this story just expands and accents it even better. **Spoiler**By the end of this book I felt deep sympathy for Misha. His loss brought a tear to my eye and I could totally feel through the words that Keri used. It was an amazing ending that had me hyped up for Tempting Evil!I was hooked from book 1 and I couldn't wait to get into this second one. The storyline develops well and keeps you informed by answering questions you didn't know to think to know about these characters. Very well put together and has you dancing for the next one."
4,"Not bad, but could have been better","Overall, Kissing Sin was entertaining and I didn't want to put it down. On the other hand, Riley spent a lot of time on her back, against the wall, on a desk...essentially anyplace but a bed. I'm not a prude in anyway shape or form and Arthur wasn't explicit but it almost seemed as if the sex was mentioned just cause. Kissing Sin is a total set-up for the next book, so a lot of stuff is left hanging...though you already know Riley becoming exactly what she said she didn't want to become in the beginning. A lot of interesting stuff is revealed along with a couple of new characters. We also say hello to one we thought was gone and a final goodbye to another."
3,Somewhat boring,"Riley Jenson, werewolf-vampire hybrid, continues on her quest to find out why certain powers are so interested in her. I liked the first book because even though her werewolf heritage is presented as an explanation (or an excuse?) Riley is portrayed as a strong, intelligent, sexually uncompromising non-monogamous female. However, even though I like the character and even though the story isn't bad I was a little bored and didn't have a problem with putting the book down when real life needed my attention. If you like vampire/werewolf romances it's not a bad read but do start with book 1: Full Moon Rising. I'm giving Kissing Sin 3 stars because I liked the first book so much."
5,Action Packed -- Sexy -- Not Overdone,"I've read the Anita Blake series and love the books -- except the fact that sex scenes will go on for pages and pages. I think that is unnecessary. This heroine has a lot of sex, but the sex scenes don't make up the whole entire book -- like the LKH's Princess Meredith books. I do like the story line -- that the heroine is half vampire and half werewolf and that she was given drugs that seem to have enhanced her abilities. I am curious which man is going to be her mate -- is it going to be the vampire (since she is going to be converting more to her vampire side) or the new alpha werewolf, Kellen? I do like the fact that these books touch on a female's sexuality and that it isn't necessary for them to conform to the double standard in society."
4,"Not perfect, but still essential...","Although one of my fellow reveiwers points out some valid criticisms of this book, I'd like to point out that if you are a fan of these types of magazines and you have the Feral House book ""It's a Man's World: Men's Adventure Magazines, the Postwar Pulps"" you'll still want this book, even though it's not as well written. Yes, this book does feature a lot of the lesser cover artists, but it gives me a real jolt to see some of these covers again after all these years. I did not buy these magazines myself but saw them at my uncle's house and so havn't seen them since they were first new. So the more cover reproductions the better I say. I just wish someone would do a book on these mags that would reproduce more of the interior artwork, which often had more nudity and violence then they could get away with on the cover."
5,Wonderful look at men's adventure magazines,"This is a fantastic book, with great color photographs of covers and interiors of men's adventure mags. The animal covers, the WW2 covers, they're all here. I wish there was a whole series of books like this - I'd buy every one."
2,Not nearly as good as Acoustic Shack,"Since this was so darn cheap, and I loved Acoustic Shack (of which Michael Misiuk was half) I thought I'd give it a shot.It isn't the worst album I've ever heard, but there wasn't a single good song on here that could even remotely compare to ""Radio Play,"" ""Torment Party,"" ""It's Good to Know,"" ""Bad Moon Rising,"" or even ""It's a Mystery.""Part of the problem is that Lisa always bested Michael in the vocals department to begin with (though ""Red Door"" and ""Carry Me to My Castle"" weren't bad). But this also seems to be some weird musical experiment for Michael, not his usual cool riffs, just a lot of three-chord jamming in a really bad punk style. No fast guitar scales. No catchy tunes. No terribly profound lyrics.This album is bland as peanut butter without jelly. I guess I'll have to dig my old _Fret_Buzz_ off the shelf..."
3,"Good, But Not Good Enough","Review by Mike Watson:Coming to us from the metalcore mecca of California is one of the better bands in the genre, Embrace The End. ETE step fourth with not a whole lot originality, but that's not to say it isn't good. Most of Counting Hallways to the Left is pretty typical aggressive metalcore, the one thing it lacks is the over abundance of the almighty chug breakdown (thankfully). Embrace the End is an incredibly talented band, infusing a lot of great metal and melodic riffs into their songs to make them interesting. However, the truth is it's nothing new or different. If metalcore is your genre of choice, Embrace The End is the new band of 2005 to check out because they are destined for great things, but if you are looking for something brand new and groundbreaking you may want to hold out a little longer."
5,E-mail El Dorado,"An excellent resource for the new Internet Marketeer. Everyone should get this book! It's compelling, informative and motivational. Excellent value for money! Dr. Jeffrey Lant is a true pioneer of Cyberspace Marketing."
5,An Internet Marketer's Dream,"I read Dr. Lant's book, then I read it again. It has boosted my business 100 fold! If you think you can go it alone on the Internet, think again. This man is pure genius and will soon become your best friend."
2,Except for the one unreleased track...not worth it,"This CD has the track ""Love Looks Good On You"" from Mirror Image, and is the only place you can find this track on CD, but other than that, the CD has reletively poor sound quality and the edits of the hits."
5,Great multi-use scope!,"I purchased this for my science teacher wife. She was thrilled. It is of exceptional quality and durability. Very compact and the fact that it can be used for both astronomical and terrestrial purposes is a big plus. The tripod is of good quality and light weight. Even so it seems quite sturdy. I would highly recommend a 5-10 lb weight suspended from the scope mount center. It will make images far more stable. If you have difficulty picking out night-sky objects the Autostar can be a big help in getting started. This is not a deep sky scope, more for lunar and planetary observations, bird watching and spying on neighbors (reviewer's note: the last is a joke...honest!)."
4,Great telescope for amateur astronomer,"I bought this telescope for my 9 years old niece but I really enjoy too this experience.PRO:a)It's easy to understand how it's work (whith the manual of course).b)The tripod is usefull and it's easy to install the telescope on it.c)Autostar works great and guide you to see the objects at nightd)The eyepieces are great (Jupiter looks very well with his four moons, Saturn its so clear but little)e)It's work to see trees, birds, and nature, great!CONS:a) I find the alignment hard, there's no way (at least I don't know how) to put the coordinates of the place you are. I live in Honduras, Central America, I put the country in the autostar, but that information I think makes the alignment not exact. Advice: the alignment it's with too stars, it's important to know the constellations to facilitate the alignment. Alignment could be difficult but not big deal!Sorry for my english (I am spanish speaker)"
3,Good.,"I bought the ETX 80 AT. I am satisfied but, I couldn't test all the resources. So Paulo is not a good city to watch stars and planets.The telescope looks like (I'm forcing a little bit) that machine gun that you saw in The Jackal (Bruce Willis) but with less precision.I guess I need the eyepiece with zoom, but it can not be shipped to Brazil.In short, a telescope is cool, but I paid a heavy price for it by the very high import taxes that I pay.US$ 269,00. Here in Brazil it cost (about) US$400,00.Good country I live!"
5,"Dick Hyman, genius",dick Hyman and Lou Stein play on this CD.If you like piano jazz and good music you will enjoy this in your CD lbrary. I would say easy listening. Soothing and relaxing.
3,Loads of fun in this Corman film,"DVD transfer: Prensented in color, the transfer is very good.Cloris Leachman and Ann Sothern combine for a lot more laughs and fun than Roger Corman's earlier ""bad woman"" film, 'Big Bad Mama'. The release is rated PG without the nudity associated with the first film. I liked this film as it follows the same plot as other Corman films on this subject but adds a lot of humor. It is also based in the 1950's rather than the depression. A great road trip movie which does have some violence. Look for fine supporting roles from Stuart Whitman, Linda Purl and Danny Most.The filnm owes much of its success to director, Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner for 'Silence of the Lambs'). Demme is just one of dozens of great filmakers and actors who got a chance to perfect their professions under Corman.Recommended for: Roger Corman fans and anyone who would like a good laugh. For teens and up."
2,DVD Not the Original Movie,"I wanted a DVD to replace my old, worn VHS tape. Unfortunately, the DVD is an edited version. Story is the same, but eliminated scenes make for poor transition and missing character interaction, capared to the original. Do not buy the DVD if you expect to see what was produced many years ago. Look for an older VHS if you want the full movie. Too bad this information was missing before the purchase."
2,Crazy Moma,"Mid 1970s flick set in the late fifties. A ""B"" movie at best. Forgettable acting and plot. Cloris Leachman was much more fun in the recent ""Dancing with the stars"", I loved her in that!! Car buffs will LOVE THE CARS, but CRINGE at the number of classic 1950s machines destroyed and maimed (including a RARE 1960 EDSEL) to make this low budget back-row-of-the-used-car-lot quality filler. --- Sorry Charlie, just once I'de like to see a movie of this type without having to see the old cars wrecked. (Try working on a better plot, and not have to depend so much on destruction for ""entertainment"", these classics can never be replaced.)"
1,Can't: Product Not Received,"I did not get this product: ""Crazy Mama""I did not get a credit on my invoice and credit card.Not sure I should shop here again.Also, I DO NOT GIVE IT ONE STAR.I haven't been able to see it!"
4,"Directors Cut of ""CRAZY MAMA""","A joyous, unrelentless, kitchy celebration of 1950's Americana, Rock n Roll and the road.This ""Directors Cut"" of Crazy Mama is a lot of fun because it also includes a feature length audio commentary by its director Jonathan Demme and the produscer Roger Corman.Follow 3 generations of womwn and the men they pick up. It's general mayhem as their crime spree races from California to Arkansas.CLASSIC 50's HITS SOUND TRACK - Set in 1950's rural America, with a great Rock n Roll sound track, it's a hillarious romp starring Cloris Leachman and Ann Sothern as the Crazy Mamas of the title.....who form a gang of regular, ordinary people who rob gas stations, super markets and eventually banks....the eldest member being an 82 year old grannie.This movie is a lot of fun!"
3,Lady in Red is ok,"The Lady in Red is worth buying but Crazy Mama is terrible waist of film.The Lady in Red is about the woman who was with Dillinger when the FBI shot him in Chicago. The fim is ok and worth watching.Crazy Mama on the other hand is horrible, don't waist your time on it."
5,So good I had to pass the goodness on,"This review won't be as detailed as I'd like it to be because, immediately upon reading Gary Copeland Lilley's book, The Subsequent Blues, I gave it away. Twice. I liked it so much I had to make sure other people knew about it. I got it back the first time, but the second dude I gave it to walked off with it. He called the next day to say he dug it immensely, but I don't think he's planning to give it back. And I'm alright with that. That's a testament to the power of Lilley's work. It's poetry people want to share, and it's full of poems people want to possess. These poems are forceful and real, and the people, the gods, the dogs, and cars and streets and bars that fill these poems are grand, direct, awe-full, and true. I bought the book because a brother I admire read me three poems from it and I felt like I had to read them all. I should of known, when I lent it to my buddy, I wasn't getting it back any time soon."
4,i liked it,This was a game I bought at the time because it was one of the cheapest PS2 games at the store. I got it home and could not put it down thanks for the memory card i was finally able to. My son is now trying to get passed the 3rd level though we have not played enough to get to the end we still have fun playing it. It is easy to move the snowboarder and make her do tricks I think that if you like to play a snowboarding game and yet do tasks this is a game for you.
1,snoozeathon,I really disliked this game because it had no good freatures... it was based on a easy thing... snow boarding.. but they really screwed up!
4,Carney and Casey are great!,"Miracle of the Heart: A Boys Town Story is a well above average made-for-TV movie. Art Carney is convincing as the crusty old priest who is getting pushed aside as supervisor by a younger man. Casey Siemaszko is terrific as a tough young car thief whose miserable life is changed, for the better, when he is shipped to Boys Town as an alternative to a jail sentence. Like most TV movies, the action is built around somewhat detracting (and obvious) commercial breaks. But Miracle of the Heart is well worth watching for the uplifting story and fine performances."
3,They were better off...,"... with their original vocalist, Dave. But this still works pretty well, I guess."
5,GREAT READ!!!!,"Enjoyed the first book! Anxiously waiting to read the sequel, Knights of Solindell!! Vivid imagery, couldn't put the book down. Upset that I finished it before a long flight back home."
2,"contains the text, but not well.","This volume contains catullus's poems, in the latin and translated, but it is not easily navigable, and it doesn't look real good."
2,A big downer,"If you want to relive the attacks and get depressed, buy this DVD. It sounds great, but personally I'm not into wallowing (again) in the horror of 9/11. He should have waited a while to record this. This is big time depressing (understandable for the day), but I don't need to relive it over and over. Frankly, he still owes us all a correcly engineered ""Brand New Day"" DVD."
5,All This Time...,This is presented in anamorphic widescreen. The documentary and concert are presented beautifully. Don't let the label on the box deter you this is a loaded disc clocking in at nearly 3 hours and includes songs not on the US cd.
3,"Very good technically, but musically boring.",The video and audio aspects are very good. But the music itself is quite unexciting. This DVD is best served at bedtime....you'll be asleep before you know it.
5,History of Sting through a jazz eye,"I first saw this on A&E many years ago. I guess what stands out (to me anyway) is the fact that the concert took place on the very day of the terrorist attacks on N.Y. and the opening song performed is the song Fragile and when Sting begins to sing it you can see the words hitting him and having a deeper meaning in light of the events of that day. IF you are a fan of Sting's music or even a jazz fan such as myself, this product is definitely for you! He takes versions of his songs and places them in various jazz settings. It is really a nice way to hear some old favorites. He has top notch musicians playing this stuff and Sting should be commended for his arrangements on this project. Throughout the years this is still one of my favorite Sting CD's as well as the video. If you are looking for a rock concert...this aint it! If your looking for boring jazz this aint that either (great grammar huh?) but if your looking for something played well than purchase this!!!"
4,Mellow Sting,"The nightmare of September 11 didn't stop Sting from performing a great show at his home in Italy for a bunch of devotees (and cameras). While the concept is very self indulgent, give Sting credit for assembling an excellent cast of under-utilized musicians to augment his reworkings of his songbook.The setting for All This Time is much different than last year's Brand New Day DVD. So too are the reworked versions of the songs performed. Some work better than others. Most are interesting. But even Manu Katché (drums) and bass wunderkind Christian McBride can't infuse too much life into dead tracks like Hounds of Winter or When We Dance.The DVD adds extra performances and a long documentary including a full practice run through of Desert Rose with Cheb Mami that was not done during the actual show.Get this DVD. It's well worth it.[DW]"
5,Class V Hitchball includes 1-7/8 Nut & Lock Washer,"Arrived in excellent condition quickly from a nearby distribution center. This ball is heavy and fit the 1 1/4 inch hole in my class V hitch within tolerance. The included Nut is 1 7/8 inch so you'll need a big socket to tighten this down. Shank seems to be perfect length for my Draw-tite 4285 4"" drop hitch."
5,"Great 2"" hitch ball with a big ol' shank!","I recently began towing a 3500 lb camping trailer and bought a weight distributing hitch to tow with my 2007 Toyota 4Runner (happened to also be a Curt; model 17300 IIRC) and the hitch is made to accept a beefy 1 1/4"" shank ball. Nobody in town has these in stock and although the hitch came with an aluminum adapter ring so you could use a 1"" shank ball, I wanted to take advantage of filling the hole with as much steel as possible. Amazon Prime to the rescue! I've only used it for one extended trip so far but all appears to be well. I did have to visit my favorite tire shop in town to have the ball tightened as the nut is 1 7/8"" and they want 450 lbft of torque to secure it. If you don't already own the tools to install it, be sure to either order the socket/wrench you'll need to tighten it or have a ""Plan B"". Your typical ""dogbone"" box wrench you can buy at most auto parts stores/etc. ain't the right size for this bad boy!"
5,One of the best books I own,"Don Seegmiller is definitely a master in Digital Character Creation and his book is brilliant. He takes you step by step through the art of creating characters, using color and textures to give your characters a superb look. This book provides a practical way to learn how to create digital characters from scratch in a way that I have never seen before. It's good for beginner and advanced users. This book rocks!"
4,AWESOME BOOK ABOUT CHARACTER DESIGN,This book is totally out of this world on the topic of character design. Very detailed and well thought out. I will definatly recommend it to designers and artists.
4,Completely unknown & completely deserving of attention,"Although almost unknown outside of the Washington DC area, Grits were a very popular local attraction during their decade of life. They never released any material during their existence, but this live release, which showcases their carefully constructed compositions juxtaposed with long jamming solos is a fine introduction to their work. Using a basic framework of keyboards, guitar, bass & drums [but with the guitarist doubling on viola, & the basist doubling on violin], & with surprisingly strong vocal harmonies, Grits created something unusual, appealing & quite timeless that deserves to be known by a large number of people than the few [like me!] who remember them from their DC days of 20 years ago!"
5,LOVE this band!!!,"Wow, takes me back... shows at the PsycheDeli, WGTB radio at Georgetown U. I love this band. Always did, always will. Great shows. Tom Wright was a fantastic guitarist. The whole band had such finesse."
4,Good fit,I've had these shoes for two seasons. They are comfortable and provide a good foundation for my swing without the inconvenience of having to replace cleats.
1,Double heart necklace,Worst piece of jewelry I've ever bought. The chain broke the first time I went to put it on.
3,appreciation and disappointment,"I appreciate Dr. Emmanuel Lartey's case studies and personal revelations of experiences, poems and thinkers meaningful to him. At these points the book comes alive. However, too often Dr. Lartey appears to feel obligated to simply hit the highlights of a broad range of authors. This survey of viewpoints might be helpful in pointing out directions for more exploration, but contributes little to Lartey's own wrestling with his central question: ""How are persons of different ethnicities, cultures, genders, faiths and socio-economic circumstances to live together reasonably on one earth, the resources of which are not unlimited, in the light of historic relations of dominance and subjugation?"" Perhaps his most interesting ten pages (128-139) contain his response to this question, as he lays out the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, and tempers that with an African perspective on community: ""the person is a community of selves, in community with others."""
1,ITEM SHIPPED IS NOT WHAT'S SHOWN IN PICTURE,"If I could rate this NEGATIVE 5 stars, I would have.I ordered this liking the fact that there's no hook around the ear. When I opened the box, it was not even close to what's pictured and wasn't compatible with my phone. I contacted the seller who said that someone else sells them for him and he was unaware of the problem. However....it's still shown on Amazon! Also, he told me he would refund the money, yet I haven't seen it yet. That was about a month ago!I'm not happy and will never order from him again and I suggest you don't either!"
1,You've Got To Be Kidding!,"Where do I start. This book was simply awful. For starters it was totally unrealistic as well as the fact that the political scenes and the obvious lack of research with regard to politics was simply appalling!The main characters both were depicted in my opinion as not being the ""sharpest knives in the drawer"" and there would NOT be any way possible that these two pathetic characters could represent anyone let alone African Americans.Maybe the next book in this series will be better but so far........"
5,Love this!,"Have used this product for about three months daily and I just love it!! I can see and feel the difference. My skin is softer, clearer and smooth. Fragrance is nice, not at all heavy."
1,The cream only has half!!!!!,"The cream only has half!!!!! Not fully fill the cream up!!! Seems like not a new one!!!! Very disappointed!!!!Never seen before that new product only has half, not full."
1,half was gone !,"I fund half was gone when I open tne container. All of them ,I ordered 3, half of cream was gone . I felt verybad because I paid intl shipping chare 40$ for these. return makes me pay more and even I cancel the order which I paid shipping as much as the product price I lose money for nothing. terribel experience at Amazon"
4,Nhuthuy,I like this product. It makes my skin feel very solf in the morning after I wash my face. It's a good night cream for the price you pay. Love it and definitely will buy it again.
5,Have Fun with Caution,"With our constant pool-presence and supervision, our 2 1/2 year old was able to swim all around the pool by herself while wearing this. She could turn in circles easily and it didn't tip over at all. She throughly loved this experience and that makes us happy. Problems - it did not inflate with our bike pump - we had to go to the service station. It began to deflate after about 2 weeks so we had to make a return trip. It completely deflated and was unusable after the third month. We are ordering another one - because it really seems to help her with pre-swimming activities!"
5,Perfect for grandchildren in Jacuzzi,We have 2 grandaughters who like to go in our rather large/deep jacuzzi and this is the perfect swimwear. It works better than the large arm bands or bulky lifevest.The outfit stretches to fit the 2 year old or the 4 year old. This would be perfect for anyone with toddlers at the beach or pool. Only downside is you must have a bike pump...not able to blow up by mouth.
4,Does the job,"My daughter was very nervous about going into the pool. This flotation device held her face and shoulders above water and gave her the confidence to swim. And it was simple to put on and take off. The only problem we came across was when she used it for an extended period of time in a day, she would get a rash under her arm from the innertube inside of the swimsuit. Just a heads-up for anyone with sensitive skin."
4,Works great,"Great way for kids to get used to the water. Keeps them upright and allows them to go where they want under their own power. no worries about them getting planted face first as there are with most ""life"" jackets."
5,Incredible confidence builder!,We purchased this item 2+ years ago and used it for 3 seasons and we are just now coming to find another to replace the one we have! We loved this product our daughter mastered it easily and we (and she) were very confident about it's safety. She was able to be independent in the water like the big kids and we were able to enjoy the freedom of keeping an eye on her from outside the pool!
2,Not what I thought,"I bought this swim school trainer, but my 2 year old twins are too young to hold themselves up and fall forward when they're wearing them. Plus, one of them came with a leaky tube. I don't feel like these tubes serve any purpose. I went and bought one with a bigger tube and just the tank top. It works a little better, but nothing will hold up a small child at this age."
3,Aquza Leisure Tube Swim Aid,My daughter had a product simular to this as a child and she could swim like a fish. I had been looking for this for over a year and was very glad to find it. On my grandaughter first time using it she went face foward and couldn't get upright.She has done a little better now but it is VERY had to get on.
1,A hole after a week!!,"Seemed really durable at first glance and I wrote a great review - now, after only 2 uses, it was deflated. Tried to reinflate - no luck - it's already got a hole! Didn't think to save the receipt :-(. Very disappointed. I think it may have come with a repair patch, but how in the world would you even repair it with the fabric wrapped around the tube?!"
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible - IT TIPS BE CAREFUL,"After ton's of research, I finally bought this item for my 2 year old. The tube tipped over, fortunately my husband was right next to him to flip him back over.Do not buy this. Its cheap and poorly made."
1,Poor Quality & BAD Customer Service,"I purchased 2 of these trainers manufactured by Aqua Leisure from our local K-Mart. We used the first one for less then 30 days when the tube started leaking. We opened the other one and when we filled it, it already had a leak. I contacted Aqua Leisure and was told by there customer service that unless I had a receipt they would not warranty the trainers. I told them I would send them the one that had never been worn, I was told they would not warranty them. DO NOT purchase an aqua leisure trainer, they are of POOR quality!!!!"
1,Awful!,This suit was a horrible experience for my little man. Everything was okay until he started crying after about an hour in the pool holding his arms in the air. The material they used on this thing is not good for baby sensitive skin. He was rubbed raw under both arms and in between his legs. He screemed for a half hour until I could find something that soothed it. I tried everything and babypowder finally did the trick. It was pitiful. Needless to say I took it back. I only picked one star because there wasn't a zero star to pick.
2,Not for tall children-very tight!,"My son is 20 months and the age on this says 2-4. Now I understand that you can't always go by age, and that height and weight are a factor. If your child is tall, this trainer is not for you. My son is tall and we had to stretch to get it on him so we never got to use it. Hopefully when we have another child we can use it, but for now we wasted the money on something we couldn't even get one use out of!"
1,Dangerous!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Flips over. Do not buy! If I was not carefully watching my daughter, she would have flipped over in this device and ended up with her head in the water and feet in the air, instead she just got a head dunk in the water. Thank goodness I was close by. Still searching for a fabulous flotation device that is safe and comfortable."
4,Pool Fun!,"We purchased two of these for our two year old twin girls. They have worked beautifully at teaching the girls to balance themselves to keep face out of water, and both girls are now swimming laps around our pool and having so much fun! The children DO have to learn to balance themselves or they will end up either face in water or the float seems to flip them to their back. The only real setbacks I've noticed involve getting the float on, can be tough getting the arms in... and the chaffing! Upper arms and thighs get extremely chaffed in this device. To solve this problem, we will be wearing longer shorts and tee shirt instead of bathing suits from now on so skin is not actually touching the float. I believe this will take care of the problem and the girls won't know the difference. They absolutely love being able to actually swim around the pool and spin around."
5,Great floatie!,We have tried all kinds of floaties in our pool with our three children and this is by far the BEST!!
4,Great but not US Coast Guard approved,"We purchased this product for our three year old daughter. She LOVES it. However, the private pool club that we belong to said that we can only use US Coast Guard approved flotation devices. The life guard gave us a life jacket to put on her instead. So, if you belong to a club, check to see whether they have a similar policy."
2,Not very safe for light-weight kids,"My daughter is pretty small - and this fits - which I like.However, the tube portion would be safer if it were sewn further up under the arm area.The way it is [more around the mid-section], it allows her to tip forward WAY too easily. I would never just let her swim around on her own or take my eyes off of her, but God forbid she ever fell in, her head would not be kept above water. I'm too freaked out by that to use this again."
5,Swimming,I ordered this for my 2year old granddaughter. My daughter-in-law was very pleased. It gives Olivia confidence in the water. It was just what we wanted.
1,Great idea but broke early,This is a great product in theory but after 2 uses it got a hole in it and had to be thrown away. We ended up buying a similar product that only has the tank top and the tube and it has been much more durable and mich easier to get my 19month old son in and out of. plus it can be blown up by mouth rather than using a bike pump
1,DEFECTIVE TUBE IN THE AQUALESUIRE SWIM SUIT,"We bought this suit for my grandson last summer, he was too small so we put it away. We brought it out for him to use this summer since he is now two years old and to our surprise it was deflated and the tube was shot. We patched it and used it for awhile but it wouldn't even hold a patch, the tube is junk! The suit is a great idea and he swims so well with it on. We immediately ordered another one and to our disappointment, this one started to deflate after he wore it about four times! We had this same suit for our eighteen year old grandson and it lasted forever, I wish I would have kept that one. It was definitely made in the USA back then and that is the difference! It is a great item, it just needs a good inner tube in it because it definitely keeps a toddler well balanced in the water and it is unbelievable how well he kicks his feet and travels around the whole pool with this suit."
3,Sizing off,I bought this for my 15mo and though it was sized 2-4yrs it was way too short. I am going to try and make it work this season since it was a little pricey but disappointed.
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I am a fan of this type of swim aide BUT i recently purchased 2 of these at our local K-Mart. The first one lasted 30 days, the second one popped before we could use it at all. I contacted AquaLeasure directly and they said that I could only get an exchange or refund if I still had the receipt!! Who keeps a receipt!! I still had the box, and the second tube had never even been in the pool. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS MANUFACTURER!!!"
2,Not very useful,"A swim product that does nothing but tip your child over and dunk his face into the water? Not great. It seems durable, and if you keep your hand on it the whole time, it will work, but really, it's just easier to hold your child without this piece of crap."
3,This one didn't last too long.,"We purchased two different floats, one for my older son and one for my 2 year old. Well this one tore almost immediately after inflation. The other one has been great. Also, I saw this one at Kmart for $[...], so check local stores before purchasing online. It really hurt to see it at that price after I purchased it for more and then for it to not even last long, uuugh!"
1,Not for younger children,"My grandmother was a YMCA swim instructor and taught me and my 9 cousins to swim using this trainer. I was delighted to find it on here and buy it for my son. We have tried it at 18months, 24 months and 30 months and each time the tube has flipped him face down and would have held him in that position. I do not like this tube at all for him right now, but I'll hold on to it and try it again when he is school aged (if it still fits and he still needs it)."
4,Strengh is the key...,My 2 1/2 year old has tried this several times now and is one of the kids who tips forward face first into the water. I realize that the difference with her and other kids I've seen using this independently is trunk strength. My girl is simply too weak to keep her trunk balanced (ie butt down) in the water. If I'd known that this was the key I would have predicted she'd have a hard time. She still can't go up steps without using her hands.I think she'll get much more/better use out of this next summer when she's 3. I don't condemn the Trainer though. It's the kid that wasn't ready for it.
3,Best flotation device for toddlers,I got one of these last summer for my 2 year old and it was the best! The regular inflatable tubes can easily come off but this suit stays on and she feels like she is really swimming! This summer we will have to wean out of it and learn to swim but it was nice for when she was a little young to learn!
1,Need special pump to inflate,"The box doesn't mention that you need a special pump to inflate this swim trainer. We tried using 2 different bike pumps without success. I emailed the company and got the following reply, ""In order to effectively use a Boston valve, it is recommended that you use a low pressure electric pump, a bellow pump, or the reverse end of a vacuum cleaner."" My vaccum cleaner doesn't seem to have a reverse end, so I guess I need to buy a pump in order to use the toy. Getting to be very expensive."
1,Be careful - know its intended use.,"This product is not intended for those under 2. I know the product states this but as my son is larger than an average 2 year old at only 18 mths we have to try something that will fit him. This product has an extrmemly durable inner tube, its so buyant it can nearly hold up an adult. Therefore, any child on the low end of the weight scale will have difficulty using it. The tube has a natural tendency to turn on its side with the child in it, which means my son's face gets pushed into the water. He is not strong enough to pull up his head becasue the tube is too buyant. My son weighs 30lbs which is well within the weight range but as you can see you child must also be able to lift his own body weight. This product is a hazard if you are not very diligent when small children are using it and is better suited to older and larger children."
5,this wonderful invention,"this toy is the best thing known to man for your little guy or girl...ours have went through two kids...my little brother jake who is 7 now and my two year old son kaibnee. i was always scared taking kaibnee to the pool because his ideal thing was to jump off the edge wethere someone was standing there or now i was always afraid to turn my back for 5 seconds now kaibnee can jump in and hes fine and hes learning to paddles and kick his feet...this is truly the best know ""swinwear"" and i wouldnt allow my child to use anything but this"
2,Be Careful,"This item did not work well for me. My son is two and weights 29 pounds. In the pool, the float kept tipping to one side. I blew the float up correctly and it still did not work well. Also, If your child was to tip over into the water and was wearing this device, he/she could drowned (this can happen with any device) but with this item the float would keep the child's head down. Please be very careful with this item."
1,WARNING-DO NOT PURCHASE,"I bought this product for my 2 year old. It DOES NOT keep the child above water. Her face kept going under the water. I thought that I would feel safe with her wearing this in the pool, but I don't. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Color Counts,"The Swim Trainer is great, except that the yellow collor attracts bees; they sting it thinking it's a flower, and for the moisture after coming out of the pool, and it gets a hole. Unfortunately, the hole cannot be fixed because of the one piece design. We went through two of these ""swimmies"" in about 3 weeks time because of the bees. Otherwise, the kids love it and it really helps them enjoy the water - and I feel safe with it too. It keeps their heads above water really well!"
1,I would not put your toddler in this swim trainer,"I bought this for my 2 year old son, and it did not keep him up at all. Your child would have to be underweight to use this trainer. Very disapointed."
3,Weight limit?,"The age limit says 2-4 yrs old, but I think weight might be the number we all need. My son is tall for 2.5 yrs old and weighs 33 lbs. This thing did not keep him stable above water at all. We ended up buying the oldschool water wings. I tried adding air to it thinking I didn't have the pressure right but it didn't seem to help. If I let go of him at all he would sink to just about nose level, not a good idea in my opinion. The times he didn't sink straight down he would tip in one direction or another. I never expect to leave him out of arms reach until he's learned to swim on his own or at least keep his head up, but he's an active boy and likes to run and jump in. I want his head to have a chance to stay above water.On the other hand, I bought this after seeing a toddler wearing one at a pool we visited last summer. She was almost 3 and doing great in it. So, I was sure to buy one this summer. She was a tiny thing for 3 though."
3,Great Concept........,"The concept is the greatest; however, the product is not made very well. We have gone through 3 of them this season with our 22 month old daughter. We keep replacing it because it truly does offer independence in the pool for both our daughter and for us. It can be a bit tipsy, so you must stay close, but continuous holding is not neccessary."
5,Great Product!! A must have in my book!!!* * * * *,This is a great swim suit. I love the fact that is is all the way around the child. My son has been using these for @ 3 years now and he loves it. It keeps his head above the water plenty and loves to splash around in it. I think this is a must have for anyone with an active 2-3 year old that loves the water!!!
2,easily misplaced and forgotten,works fine but cannot thread anything to connect it to a keychain.saw it cheaper at Staples.good for a first trial
1,dont buy this,"Every time I use this flashdrive it is like aliens are testing my intelligence. You try to push it in the port, the connector slides in. You try again. And again. You make sure its locked. Slides in again. You hold it while inserting. Slides in again. Try that a few times, because you got pretty close. Then you try a few different ports. Finally, it connects.Dont buy this. It sucks."
2,Kingston 16gb DataTraveler - virtually useless,"I don't understand the good reviews on this product. I bought two a couple of months ago because of the price and the Kingston name, but I'm getting rid of them and going back to Sandisk or Ridata drives.I can't use these in any fashion where I want to play videos or mp3s off them. Either in my Oppo DVD player with a flash drive slot, or in any USB enabled audio device - it simply skips or won't play media files. Every other drive I've ever owned allows me this function, but these just die when trying to read music of video.Other than that, I've never liked the cheap feel of the case or the slider on the back."
3,A good flash drive for a week until....,"...my teenaged son bumped into a wall while it was inserted into a laptop computer. The impact was so hard, it damaged the retractable mechanism on the flash drive. I can't blame this particular flash drive, but have decided not to buy any more flash drives that are retractable. As a replacement, I bought an indestructible ""Survivior"" flashdrive, which a month later, is working great."
3,not the best but it works,"This drive is far from fast.I think 3 stars is being generous. There is no activity light,and it is in a cheaply made plastic case with a poor slider button.It does work,but I would not buy another of this model!"
4,Kingston Data Traveler,"I am completely satisfied and impressed with the Kingston. In fact, it is so small and portable, it could easily get misplaced or lost. I recommend attaching it to a neck cord. The only drawback is the difficulty to inserting such a cord through the tiny opening."
2,Not as strong as it seems,"At first I thought that this was a great product, I've had other kingston's in the past and this continued the trend. I'm not a fan of Sandisk so I thought I'd give another retractable a try, especially since this one has such high reviews.Worked great for about 3 weeks, but then it started to slow down on transfer rates, not impressive in the first place. I'm rough on electronics, and unfortunately the plastic didn't hold up. On campus, people bump into computers all the time and one time was enough to break the plastic on this. It only worked for one day after that and is now useless.So over-all I can't say I'm impressed."
3,Cheap but Flimsy,"On the tech end this product leaves a bit to be desired. It is USB 2.0 but it still seems slow. With me having to sit around while I load larger files. I also noticed a fairly large file not being completily loaded, however this may have been an error on my part so I will not count that against the device.The design on this is fairly bad. It's flimsy, I feel like I may break it if I keep it in my pocket. Also the ability to retract the usb connecter, while ueful, makes the flimsiness seem all the more urgent. It has a tendency to not lock into my bay well. Since I'm on a laptop it's come loose a couple of time forcing me to restart the uploading progress.Overall it gets the job done. And is good if you want to move larger files, but I'm sure there are superior models out there and I would recommend getting one of those before buying this."
2,terrible design,"Pros: FastCons: there is no lock when the drive is in the extended position so if the USB slot offers any resistance it slides back in. You have to keep pushing the slider mechanism to get it inserted into any USB slot properly. Also it has no cover so although the tip is protected from damage when it is retracted, it still gets dirty."
3,Ugly and harsh on the fingers,"Don't get this if you're looking for a comfortable drive to use or have arthritis in your use-hand or some thumb injury on it: the slider is hard to slide, not super hard, but very hard. It's very annoying. Unfortunately I lost mine before I could put anything on it or see it's true capacity."
3,Kingston DT100/8GB Data Traveler,The Kingston DT100/8GB USB data storage device is a great value for portable data storage. It is very reliable and also durable. My only comlaint is that the device is very slow. Backing up 3GB of data on my Windows XP Pro operating system took an hour and a half to complete using this drive. I gave it away to my father in-law and purchased a high speed 10GB Seagate drive for about double the money because I don't have hours to wait for data transfers to complete.
4,stands up to abuse,"I read a bunch of reviews from all sorts of folks who seem to know what they were talking about on this product but they left out something. It's rugged. I've put my drive through the ringer; front pocket, back pocket, lost it under my feet while driving and eventually found it in the back seat. And that little switch/slide that brings in and hides that insertable piece, is perfect for the guy who loses those little caps like bread ties. Beyond that, it's a drive. It holds a tons of songs, e-books and videos, and is slim enough to fit between all those other slot takers.Chris"
5,Data Safe,This 16GB Data Flash Drive Traveler will give you peace of mind. I back up my daughter's laptop with it easily and it is great to be able to take important date and lots of large format pictures with you on trips. Love it .... works GREAT!!! Highly recommend. Now ... if I can only get it away from my daughter.
2,Worked for a year... But that's it!,"I bought this flash drive in December of 2008. For a while it worked fine and suited my needs, although I didn't like the slide design. Something about it felt flimsy. It was not until a few months ago that all of my files on the drive were destroyed. When I would open the drive up, I would get may weird symbols where my files used to be. In the end, I tried deleting the flash drive and then putting the files back into it. That worked for a while until the flash drive started not to work on Apple computers. I would plug it into the computers at my school and they would not recognize it. I have a Mac and PC at home and it didn't work on the Mac at home either, however it did work on the PC. But it took a really long time for it to load. Do not buy this product! They seem not to last very long. Now I have to by a new one because it is completely useless if I can use it on a Mac."
4,Beware If Your Computer Is AMD With Win 7 64 bit,I brought it about 1 year ago when I was still using Intel processor and Win XP. The flash drive was working fine and wonderfully. It still works as usual if I plug it in those computers using Intel processors even with Win 7. However it doesn't work on computers with AMD processors with Win 7. I have no complain on this product when I bought it because it performed well and it still works fine in my old computer. But I have to inform those who owns an AMD and Win 7 64 bit computer because it won't work on it. I am not the only one who encountered this problem. I searched the web and found many other people who used AMD and Win 7 had the same problem. I went to the Kingston web site and hope to find a solution. I learnt that this model has already been discountinued. It means no support any more. It is the reason that I take one star off it. It is still a very good flash drive as long as you stay away from using it with AMD and Win 7 64 bit.
4,A very good flash drive,"Its easy to use, doesn't need a cap and I can carry it along with my keys. A cons is that its not that fast, large files takes forever to transfer."
5,Great,great price for a great buy now i can carry all my music on this wonderful 16 gig flash drive that i paid less than twenty bucks for i would definitly by from you again. it also only took less than a week to come in the mail.
1,Very Fragile...Not happy at all!,"The title says it all! I'm happy with the amount of space, but this flash is cheaply made. I bought it almost a year ago on eBay and the casing has fell apart several times since. It still worked, but who wants their flash drive falling apart from basic contact. I do like the retractable connector (as opposed to a separate cap) and the ability to attach it to something. Right now I still use it....just with Scotch tape wrapped around it to keep the two piece shell together."
5,USB Drive for PS3 Backup,I bought this pen drive in order to backup the contents of the original PS3 hard disk. No issues at all for compatibility. I worked fine.
3,Kingston DataTraveler 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DT100/4GB,The first time I got it I feel like it's a toy. The plastic is very unsecure to me since it feels like it's easy to break. I don't like the sliding part either. There was one time the slide part push back in when I tried to plug it in to the computer. The 4 GB is huge enough for my normal use.The price is good for this product. It's ok overall for daily use. I don't aim this product for long term (more than 3 years)
3,Not as easy to use - for ME.,"I bought this model flash drive and another one with the removable cap. This one is difficult to push into my USB connector, because it doesn't lock into place. It slides. Oh, it works just fine - I tried it on three different machines - but it's just awkward to use. I may buy another one of the Kingston DT1 model with the cap.I use two flash drives. One I fill up with all my writing, then take it to the bank and drop it in the safe deposit box. I bring home the one that was there and fill it up with the current stuff. That way I've got a cheapo off-site storage place for all my books. I strongly recommend you do the same - regardless of push-out connector or pop-top."
4,Very Useful,"I bought this flash drive because it has a good size for photo storage on the go and you don't have your laptop handy. I like it because it is well protected so the USB part is not easy to break when you are traveling. The only but I found is that it doesn't come with a strap, so it makes it difficult to carry when you don't have a bag."
1,Kingston DataTraveler 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive,I bought 3 of these and all three quit working after about 30 daysKingston DataTraveler 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DT100/16GB
2,Not bad but problematicly fragile,"Biggest issues:1>There is nothing I know of small enough to fasten to the back of it to make it ""lanyard"" ready. Maybe it isn't supposed to be, but it looks like there was an intention of having the ability to do such a thing.2>It fell off my desk (first time) and separated into 3 pieces. It still works, but is held together with scotch tape. I would like to have something a bit more sturdy. I've had a mug survive the same fall intact.--of course if was attached to a lanyard, it wouldn't have been sitting on my desk....It isn't unreliable, but I wouldn't buy it again because of he fragility."
3,Getting what you pay for?,"I expected a little more from this flash drive, given the reputation of Kingston memory and other flash media.The drive is reliable and well built, with no flashy extras included. The drive is not bunde with any security/encryption software, so you must find that on your own (protip: secure your flash drive people!)Read speeds are decent however sequential and random writes are slower than expected, making file transfers and saving sometimes irritating.Overall the drive is decent but not impressive in any category, for the price (at the time) it was a good bargain. Just weeks later however you can find 16 GB models for the same price or lower on Amazon and [...]. I would say pass on this for a larger drive at the same price, considering the performance."
1,Worthless within 6 months,"16 gigabytes, low cost, and convenient design. It's too good to be true for a reason.After about 5 months, the drive began to fail. It would spontaneously stop displaying the contents of the folder and not be recognized by Windows, with the only solution being to unplug it and plug it back in. This is with careful handling and always clicking ""Remove drive"" before taking it out, by the way. Since I use USB flash-drives to hold important files, I could not keep using this one. It's a shame, because having 16 gigabytes worth of portable space was really useful while it lasted."
1,Unreliable,"If it is too good to be true, it probably isn't. So with the Kingston 16G Flashdrive. Over three weeks, I have had more transfer errors with this drive than with any of the other flashdrives I have used over three years, i.e., ""cannot read disk,"" ""volume syntax in error,"" etc. Keep away from this one!"
1,Design Flaw,"The problem with this product is that the retractable USB plug loosens as you use it and before long it becomes very difficult to insert the device into a computer without the USB plug retracting on you. I purchased the device with the retractable USB plug because I did not like losing the little caps, but I would rather use a standard device without a cap than this device that can no longer be used."
3,Good item,"I liked it, except for a few problems. First, I had to use a USB extension cord because it was too long to fit in my computer's slot. Also, on Windows XP you can't access it directly from ""My Computer"". Overall, a good item."
2,Flimsy construction doesn't inspire confidence,The slider mechanism does not lock in the out position. When plugging into a tight fitting port it is difficult and clumsy to handle.
3,Merely adequate,"This unit does the job of a flash drive adequately. The tab to push open the USB connector is occasionally balky (it's cheap plastic). It would be nice if it had a large, easy-to-see in-use light (like Sandisk drives do) as well. Otherwise, the drive seems reliable and does not come loaded with crapware (like a Sandisk drive does). Overall, it's just a very average flash drive."
3,Good generic flash drive...,"The DataTraveler is fine for everyday use and transfers data quickly. There are no bells or whistles on this drive. The only down side to this drive is the difficulty with the USB connector sliding in and out of the unit. I have a SanDisk Cruzer which retracts the connector so much better. The DataTraveller's design of a thumb slide to extract the connector from the unit seems like it should have been done better. It is not as easy as it could be. If you can get the DataTraveller at a good price and use it occasionally, then it will fit your needs. If you use the drive frequently and transfer data from multiple hardware devices, I would go with a drive with a better slide mechanism."
5,Excellent Drive,"This drive has been perfect for me. I use it mostly for large .PDF and MS Office files, and have not had a hiccup yet. Most of the time, it is faster than the fileservers I use at work. Well worth the money...especially at this price!"
2,Very flimsy USB drive,"This USB Drive is very poorly made. I expected more from Kingston, who I always regarded as producing a good product. The metal USB connector, which ejects out of the main body in a clumsy, non-smooth fashion, is too easily bent up and down, opening the seems of the plastic case. Also, the body design itself seems to be too wide for some (admittedly older) USB ports. Overall, I expected a sturdier outer casing. In terms of data storage, however, I have no complaints."
4,Does what it says,"Does exactly what you expect from it. 15 GB actual storage, small and usefull.Has to be formated in NTFS (PC) or HFS+ (Mac) in order to support > 4 GB files.Watch out if you intend to transfer such files between Mac and PC..."
1,Flash Drive,"Worked perfect at first, downloaded about 220 pictures from my computer and put them into another computer with no problem. The next time I tried to use it, nothing would recognize the drive and haven't been able to use it. My other (lower Gig) flash drives have been working fine for a long time with no problems, just disappointed with this Kingston. I will stick with SanDisk."
1,Very unsatisfied,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. I bought it brand new from Amazon to use at school because I am a student. Within two weeks of using this item it shorted out and the plastic on it melted when I had plugged it in the computer for about 2 minutes, therefore it did not work anymore. I had not used it much, maybe 5 times throughout the two weeks. Amazon would not give me a refund for the item. I do not plan on buying a Kingston again."
3,Questionable,"Delivery was fast for the KINGSTON DATA TRAVELER 16 GB usb flash drive, but it is very slow. About 4 hours for downloading 600 songs. How can I tell if it is the flash drive or the computer (imac G5 Apple) 1GB ram?"
1,Bad stuff: original + replacement didn't work,I bought this DT100 4GB; my machine didn't recognize it. Sought Kingston's input; they said it was defective. (I also purchased a Kingston DT1 with this order which did work + I already owned a Memorex Traveldrive 1GB which also works). So since Amazon wouldn't exchange I asked for a replacement. The replacement also doesn't work; Kingston suggested I plug it into the rear of the computer or try the drive on another computer neither of which I want to do. So I've returned the DT100 for a refund. I wouldn't recommend this product.
2,it works as advertised but good luck getting attaching a key chain,"This USB stick works fine. However, the way it is designed, it is IMPOSSIBLE to attach it to a key chain. I've tried everything, even string, but I cant get it around the attachment which is inside a small hole. Do NOT purchase this item if you want to attach it to a key chain or anything similar."
5,Excellent!!!,El producto es excelente. Tanto la calidad como la maniobrabilidad son muy buenas. Lo recomiendo!
2,no dust/dirt protection,"this f/d has a retractable usb connector...which is a great idea... unfortunately, it isn't protected and stuff can collect in the usb connection while retracted...think of your dig cam with retracted lens with no cover...i sure wouldn't want to screw up any of my usb connections trying to insert a messed up usb connector...as far as the 16gb goes...it works great... i'd just recommend one with a cap..."
3,8.0 == 7.5,"I and my friend just bought this items.Both of our drives are exactly 7.5G not, 8.0G.This is not a matter of file system journaling eating up some of the space.The physical device itself is registering at 7.5G.Not cool."
2,Nice to have but...,"It is very nice to have 16GB of storage handy and it worked fine with my computer running xp. But I tried to use a mac and format it in HFS+ file system and while the computer could read it, it can't be seen by my xbox 360. I've successfully done this with smaller flash drives of other brands but wanted a 16GB one to work with. If you are planning on using this with an xbox 360, try a different brand."
1,DIdn't meet needs,The casing was cheap plastic and the slider to open and close device stuck before I even had the chance to use it.
4,buena memoria,bueno tengo unos dias de estarla usando es algo lenta al copiar demasiados archivos pequenos pero en grandes transferecinas esta bien
4,Great little worker,I bought this product to do some major transferring between 2 laptops. Hasn't failed me yet. The speed is pretty decent but not the best for a Kingston product.My only criticism is that the casing looks flaky. I feel like I am going to break it if it falls. On the other hand i did drop if a few times and it still works great.
4,16GB?,"I bought this memory to use with my new Kenwood car stereo receiver with a usb input. I had no trouble transferring music to it at all. My stereo ""reads"" the flash memory and switches between tracks very fast,faster than a commercial cd. I havn't as of yet experienced any data loss. My only complaint is that this isn't 16gb. Brand new out of the package,my pc shows it at 15gb. I can understand some storage space being used for formatting purposes etc;but an entire gb?My MP3 player uses less space for its firmwire!"
1,Useless,"I have this flash drive and barely used it and now I cannot store a thing on it. Used it for pictures, my husband removed the pictures and used it to transfer music to another computer, when we tried to replace the pictures I was storing on it kept getting error messages and we are no longer able to store anything on this drive. If I had been putting things on and removing things repeatedly I might understand why it would be unusable, but to use if for storage and the 1st time you remove something and try to replace, it failed! No problems with my other flash drives just Kingston-not willing to take a chance with this company again!"
1,Had it for 3 months - just died on me. Apparently discontinued!,"Avoid. Don't buy. Discontinued! It will die on you and Kingston will be VERY SLOW in honoring their warranty for a replacement. You will be without a drive for a while!Just wanted to let everyone know that this drive, just over 3 months old, all of a sudden died on me. Totally dead, it will not be recognized by any system and therefore will not even mount so I could reformat it. It just simply died I think with all my data on it. Going to the Kingston site it shows that this model has been discontinued. I wonder why? Because it DIES ON PEOPLE?!?!? :-)Also, be warned that Kingston is very unresponsive when it comes to honoring their warranty. I've been back and forth with them for almost 4 days now...After several emails from Tech Support I have filled out the ""request for replacement"" form online under the instructions from tech support. I have received no response from anyone whatsoever."
1,so over this flashdrive,my first review on amazon...and for good reason.currently looking for a replacement flash drive. so sick of my photoshop and image files getting corrupted. i took care of this flash drive too and wore it around my neck to keep it safe. i've only had this product for 7 months and i'm just done. my files started getting corrupt even from the beginning. it's pretty much a crapshoot with this drive. would never trust this brand again.
4,Reliable and reasonably priced,"This is an excellent device if you're looking for a lot of space without having to pay much for it.The only drawback was the fact that there is not a password locking feature on it (like the Memorex I had), but not much of a deterrent from buying it."
2,Planned Obsolescence?,"I've had this drive just over a year. I relied on it extensively. Yesterday, it died. I've read of similar experiences from other buyers of Kingston jump drives. All of a sudden, it looses everything including it's own identity to the computer. It appears as an unreadable, unformatted drive with 0 bytes free. The hardware mysteriously changes it's identification to Windows which now reports it as ""SKYMEDI USB Drive Device."" There is NO FIX for this condition. Your data is gone... hope you backed it up recently. The Kingston website has NOTHING about this problem which seems to be quite pervasive among purchasers of their jump drives.I was very pleased with this drive until this happened. I lost some very important files. Rest in peace!"
4,A good value,"The price is right, the size is right, the design is ""average"" at best in my opinion. This is exactly what I would expect for a value flash drive. I can recommend it for anyone who wants 4GB and a good price."
5,Great Buy!,"This flash drive has been the biggest help in storing our computer files....documents, videos, photos. And what's great is that unlike a CD or DVD, you can edit your files and re-save them!! Great seller to purchase from. Very satisfied with this item and transaction on Amazon."
4,Happy with,Kingston DataTraveler 100 - 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DT100/16GBET [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging](Purchased on 07/16/2009) Was very happy with product. Just plugged it in and dragged all my photo's to it. Do wish there was some way to attach a key ring or something to it to carry it. But found case to put it in.
4,Satisfied,"Update: Tried to change this rating to a ""one star."" The device worked fine at first for the first couple of months then all of a sudden, none of my computers would recognize it nor does the icon come up to even give me the option to even click on it. Well, There goes my 25 bucks. Stay away from Kingston!!"
4,Works Just Fine,"My computer takes a little while to recognize the USB key, but besides that it works just fine."
4,Works fine,"Have been using for about 1 month... performing as expected. Would have liked a more ""robust"" lanyard/attchment device, but so far is fine!"
5,Great Photo Transfer To TV,"I used it to transfer photos from my computer to my 70-inch Sony TV. They came out absolutely clear as a bell, even though enlarged to such a large size!I thought there would be a problem, mostly because I had never done it before, but it was so easy! It plugged right into my computer, and right into my Dishnet receiver!"
3,4G Kingston Data Traveler,"Originally bought this item to use for Ready Boost. Found out it did not support it performance wise but did not return due it to restocking fees, etc. The price was good for a 4 flash drive. Not too partial to the retractable plug, seems like dust and dirt would get inside. Not supporting ready ready boost also means the data transfer is not fast. If speed is not an issue and you don't feel you need a cover over the plug, it is a good price."
5,Very good for the price,"It is fast, and has no automatically installing drivers. 5 stars for basic functionality.The plastic case is a little bulky. It is a little bigger than it could be. It is difficult to put on your keychain, so you'll need some sort of reminder to not forget to detach it when you leave the computer."
5,Gadgester's Review - 3-stars for all the wrong reason,"With all due respect, Gadgester deducted 2-stars for the wrong reason. Ready Boost will only recognize flash-drives up to 4GB, so you wouldn't buy this 8GB drive for Ready Boost anyway. Save your money and buy a 4GB if you plan on using it for Ready Boost. If you're looking for a flash-drive that is fast, reliable and has the ability to hold a lot of info, this is a great drive! Highly recommended...."
2,"Nice features, low reliability","The rest of the reviewers have hit the features spot-on. However, having failed after likely less than 100GB of total transfer, this device has failed. It now no longer powers on in any computer and I have lost all data on the drive.For transporting data, it seems to be okay. Just be sure that you're not using it as a backup device or as the primary storage device."
2,Not Mac friendly and poor construction,"I've had the drive for about 10 months. It doesn't work well with my Mac Leopard 10.5 OS, it locks up after an undetermined amount of time and it sometimes even brings the OS along with it. Apart from this, the construction is of poor quality. It came apart after 10 months of use, the plastic seems to be very cheap. I had to tape it back together with black tape. If you want a USB drive, try Kingston's more reliable/compatible/trusty DTI series or other brands."
1,poorly constructed,"When I got this product home and tried to insert the drive into my computer's USB slot, the connector would not extend far enough (I have a Dell desktop). Eventually I took the drive out of it's plastic casing entirely and wrapped electrical tape around it so that I could use it. Don't buy this slide type. I have a drive by the same company with a cap that does not slide and it works just fine."
5,great value,No problems at all--I use it to transfer files between a Mac and a PC with no difficulties. Very convenient and highly recommended.
3,"Works fine, not great for a keychain","I have no problems with this drive technically -- it's fast enough and seems to work perfectly well. But I carry my USB drive on my keychain, and after more than an hour trying to thread the smallest possible ring through the Kingston's recessed end, I had to give up. It's simply impossible. I used a string-type lanyard instead (one I had on hand -- there's nothing in the package). I don't like this -- it dangles more and feels less secure than a simple key ring. I will keep this drive to use as a spare at home, but I'll be ordering the Sandisk that comes with a ring attached to use as my main portable drive."
3,Data Traveler Review,The data traveler works as expected.I wish there were an easy attachment for the device as their is with micro cruzer and the ativa brands.Jim Eckel
4,Daata Traveler,Easy to use. Love the retractable feature in place of a removable cap which can easily get lost.
3,Good Buy,"I bought this item on sale.Formated it to the EXT3 Linux File system.Installed Puppy Linux on it, with a bunch of multimediafiles.I use it every day for e-mail and surfing the Web.I like it.It's faster than the other types of Thumb drives, I have.Yes, It does have a lock on the thumb slider, to hold theplug in place.If you cand find one for thirty bucks or less, Grab it."
4,Kingston DT100/8GB USB Drive,"This product has 8.0 GB on it, but when i try ot place a 7.73GB file on it, it does not accept the file. Only files under 7GB can be put on. But in seperate pieces (1GB, 2GB, etc...) it can hold up to 8GB."
4,"So far, works perfectly.","Solid Slide. Not Flimsy. I use this on a daily basis transferring work from the office to the home office and vice versa. So far, works great, no problems."
4,Es una buena memoria,"La memoria llego en el tiempo indicado y aunque funciona bien, llego con un golpe o especie de quemado. Al parecer le pusieron algo caliente encima.Por esta razon no le doy una mejor puntuacion. Todo el que compra algo quiere que llegue en perfecto estado."
1,Too many issues,"I got this product to go with my 2GB drive in hopes of porting documents and music files. After a day of use, the only thing I'm able to do is pray my files stay on the flash drive without any problems.I would not use this drive to work from because it seems when the system ""hiccups"" the drive deactivates and files are lost.I would not recommend this flash drive to anyone else, no matter the cost"
1,Good...when it works...and mostly doesn't,"I bought a 4-pack of these from my local Fry's and they worked great for about 2 months. But after 2 months, two of them has completely died on me. When I insert them in my USB port it recognizes a generic USB drive, but clicking on it just says ""Please insert a disct into drive F:"". I cannot even re-format them. They are simply DEAD. I'm guessing the only thing working is the interface but the actual memory has gotten wiped out for some reason (no, I haven't been putting them on a stack of magnets).Also, this is not the first time. I had bought the 4GB before and also a 4GB from a different brand. In my experience I've found USB flash drives to be EXTREMELY un-reliable, so please don't trust any valuable data to these things. They only thing they should be used for is for temporary transfers of data."
4,Kingston thumb drive --- little wonder,I was happily surprised with the performance of this thumb drive. It is better than the thumb drive that I got from HP or Sandisk.
2,Questionable construction.,"I recently purchased this drive, and compared to others that I own, e.g., a Verbatim, this one is made of what appears to be very cheap plastic. Time will tell if it will hold up to normal use, but I have my doubts. I also doubt the retail price posted on Amazon. On the other hand, it functions well."
2,Flash Stick Memory,16 GB at your finger tips but the sliding in and out adapter it problamatic for it is difficult to get it to move.
2,be prepared to break a nail,"overall operation of the memory aspect is fine. Just some ergonomic and convenience issues that made me regret purchase. Moving the knob to get the usb connector out is tougher than it should be. May just be a one off, but shattered a thumbnail in the first few attempts. Also, I prefer to attach these sticks to a key ring fob so they are easier to find and not lose. I found no easy way to do that with the very small bar and space at the end of the stick that seems to be for this purpose. Again, so problem with the memory, just found it not meeting my needs"
5,Good Traveler,"I have never lost data from one of these. They seem to be fairly quick, (idiot proof just plug wait and use in XP and Vista).Would recommend them to anyone."
5,Good product,This is a good basic thumb drive that does what I want it to do. It has not withstood the test of time as of yet.
2,Disapponted,"OK got this yesterday. I am disappointed. Good price, nice idea. But would not recommend this for 4 reasons 1) slider switch seems flimsy and hard to operate 2) no ring for attaching to key rings or laynard... husband tried with a key ring to get it on but it pricked and hurt his finger. I spent twenty minutes trying to get it attached to something. 3) Read / write light tiny and not visible from seated position and finally 4)had problems today getting the drive seated correctly. I wish the CEO had these hassles with their own product. Maybe somebody should hire IDEO or some user interface engineers to test the product with average users in a less than average setting."
1,Cheap for a reason,"The price is great, but you get what you pay for. The sliding lock doesn't lock down, so everytime you try to insert the USB into the USB slot it folds in. I found a way to hold the slider tight while inserting, but it doesn't work everytime. I'm going to have to purchase something else. The software works great, but it is slow to copy."
4,Kingston Data Traveler 100 4 GB USB 2.0,"Same great quality,speed and storage capabilities as the Kingston 4GB you would buy in the ""box"" stores,but about $10.00 cheaper.The only differences are:Less packaging ;and no carry strap(can buy cell phone straps 3@$1.40 at a Hobby Shop)."
3,Kingston Jump Drive,"Aesthetically, the product has a real cheap feel to it. Being a USB2.0 plug-in I expected faster copying/reading rates. My older Memorex ""high speed"" jump drive is lightning quick compared to this. Other than speed though, this drive is fine, nothing spectacular, simply to be used as a hard drive backup."
5,Great Product - Great Price,"This is a great product for a good price. I looked around everywhere -- and I mean everywhere (staples, office depot, ebay, etc etc) and found this product to have good reviews for function and the price was very reasonable! I'm happy with it."
3,The fun continues.......,"Once cannot expect a third movie to be as good as the previous ones, butwhen its a good story, i dont mind, cause at least the story continues.Tim Allen is getting better as Santa Claus, seems more relaxed. Kids shouldlove it for the elves...and we also get Martin Short as Jack Frost. Whenyou view the extras, you will see how Jack Frost started out as , but waschanged for the version we see on the screen...good move.So bottom line, its not the best, but im sure glad it was made.Waiting for Santa Claus 4...."
4,Enjoyible movie,"Santa has a new family, he want to south to keep his family happy. And I've never seen this movie."
2,not so sure,"I was disappointed in the family strife in this movie. Its Santa Clause, it should be good times and magic. Bringing back to us the joy of childhood, not a reminder of real life family struggles and ruthless people trying to get ahead and promote themselves. I was disappointed to say the least."
5,Santa Clause 3- The Escape Clause,Another great movie to add to the sequel of the Santa Clause movies. It is great to see good triumph over evil and turn the evil into good at the end.
5,Great Family Movie,This is a great movie for all of the family to watch. My girls love to watch this movie together which says alot since they usually don't like the same movies. The first two parts were great as well.
3,Sequals,"Tim Allen and Martin Short are always fun. This sequal was great to see the favorites of this trilogy growing, but really just didn't live up to the wonderful imagination of the first 2 movies. Still, was fun for what it was."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"I picked this movie up hoping it would get my girlfriend and I in the holiday spirit. Unfortunately, it was a major letdown. What an absolutely disgusting portrayal of Santa Clause. I do not recommend this movie for children or for anyone else for that matter, as it missing all the things that make a good Christmas movie. I can't believe some of the gushing reviews. I expected a lot more based on the cast but I guess it's all about the script. Can't fault the actors for that. I shut this movie off after 10mins. No Christmas magic here folks. Stick with the classics."
2,Santa vs Jack Frost,"I must admit, I loved the original movie ""The Santa Clause"", and Tim Allen was wonderful as the father turned Santa. It was a funny, magical movie for families to watch. Even the follow-up movie was cute and got my ok.But this movie was not funny, nor cute, and especially not magical. It was all about a mean Jack Frost trying to trick Santa. Not a pleasant feeling anywhere throughout the movie."
2,"Too ... well, Nasty!","The idea behind ""Santa Clause 3"" might work were it not for the excessive nastiness and cynicism that permeates it. ""Santa Clause 1"" was light on its feet, fully exploiting the possibilities in the premise with humor and, for the most part, sweetness (some of the late-movie elf stuff was a little overboard). ""Santa Clause 2"" was enjoyable, keeping the sweetness but leaving out the pepper supplied in the original by David Krumholtz as Bernard the Elf. It was a bit too syrupy.""Santa Clause 3"" goes several bridges too far in the opposite direction. It gives us sort of a corporate takeover by Nazis, and revels in the misery resulting.And that, folks, is not what I want from a Christmas movie."
1,The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause,"This movie was a complete disapointment. The first two movies were so great and this movie was lacking in everything they had.The acting was stale, as if they were just going through the motions instead of getting into their characters (except for Martin Short who put a little effort into his role), the storyline wasn't good and most of all, throughout the entire movie, the comedic timing was off, meaning there were pauses or dead air after lines were said that were meant to be funny but were not funny at all.In my opinion, they should have quit while they were ahead with just the two movies."
3,Average movie,"This was definitely not as good as the first two Santa Clause Movies, it seemed to lack the humor and warmth of the first two. The first Santa Clause will always be my favorite!"
3,Disappointing,"This is the problem you can have with sequels, the frost charater can be a little scarey for the little ones, not nearly as good as the first."
4,Jack Frost nipping at Santa Claus,"Okay, this one was a bit of a let down from the previous two, but it was still cute (and a bit too predictable). Martin Short as Jack Frost is the best. Tim Allan as Santa Claus, still the best there as well. And the elves are all getting a bit older and I missed Benard the head elf in this movie. My wife and I enjoyed it and will include it in our annual Christmas movie watching tradition. And yes, I can see them working on Santa Claus 4 next year and willing to see it as well."
4,Good Family Fun,"While just a notch below ""The Santa Clause"" and it's first sequel, the 3rd installmant is just a small notch below and is good entertainment. They do add several new characters this time around and that leaves less to do for some of the returning characters. (Especially Bernard the Elf who's not in this one and Scott's son Charlie who doesn't have much to do). Martin Short's Jack Frost character starts out slow but gains steam as the movie goes along and is a notable villain. Overall, pretty good considering this is #3. This is a series where all 3 times the movies exceeded expectations and were better than the critc's judgements."
4,"A fun Christmas Movie, No Surprise","The Santa Clause 3 fits with the entire series. It is not meant to be taken series, it is just a fun Christmas story. No surprises on the plot, acting is what you would expect. My family and I enjoyed it."
5,Santa Clause 3,This was a surprisingly nice addition to the Santa Claus series! We enjoyed it a lot!
3,It's Okay.,"This was an okay movie, but #2 was definitely better. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as good, or better, however, Tim Allen is still a hoot!"
2,THe Santa Clause 1 is STILL the BEST!,Stick with version 1.This sequel does not match up.... silly.Kids never watched it more than once... a sure sign of mediocrity!
4,Christmas entertainment...,It gets the job done! It is a funny and cute movie for the whole family. I don't think it will be a classic but it isn't as bad as some people have rated it. The story could have been a bit better developed but still good. I like it that they have kept all of the characters! This is probably a first!
2,Santa Claus 3,"I was disappointed with this film.After ""Frosty"" showed up, I regainedmy sense of disbelief."
2,In My Opinion!,"I was disappointed in this third and latest sequel to The Santa Clause series! In my opinion it lacked attention-grabbing! I think it a far stretch, and not worth the continued purchases of the ongoing series that happen all too often. Maybe Hollywood is running out of fresh ideas. Thanks for allowing me the privilege to state my ""opinion""!"
3,Claus Vs. Frost...Place Your Bets!!!,"I don't like this one as well as the other two, but it's not horrible. I like how they go back in time to the original to try to stop each other from putting on Santa's suit. It reminded me of 'Back to the Future' Scott/Santa is having a tough year because his wife is pregnant, his in-laws are visiting, and Jack Frost is causing trouble at the North Pole. When Frost becomes Santa in the past, Scott has to stop him in the future. (It's kinda difficult to explain.) If you like the other ones, you may like THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE!!!"
5,wow,this is my favorite one out of the seris it very fast paced i never got bored at all watching this movie unlike the second movie you need 2 see the first one to understand it clearly yes u good understand it without seeing the first one but it helps u follow through once the escape claus happens though it is now out of theaters when it comes out on dvd in november see it u won't regret it!
2,11th day of Christmas 2012 review,"On the 11th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...The Santa Clause 3:The Escape Clause. The story while not bad,it's very predictable. It's loosely base on It's a Wonderful Life but instead of wishing he was never born,he wishes he was never Santa. The acting in here is range from so-so to bad. Martin short as the villain(Jack Frost) is a welcome presence but it fails to save this tried series from rolling on drawing from it's bag of bland gags & dumb slapstick. It's clean but boring. The sets are nice. The effects are not great but pretty good. The costumes are nice and creative too. Overall,it's not the worst but they could have better. I give this movie a 3 out of 10."
3,Good old Santa,The effects are fabulous. We were a little disappointed in the actual movie. The first one is still the best.
3,"It's ok, but...","We always try to pick up a new DVD for the holiday season and this year it was The Santa Clause 3. It's ok, but my heart still lies with the first movie. This one just seemed silly beyond any possibility whereas the first makes you think ""maybe..."". The kids thought it was ok, but I haven't seen it played again since the first showing, so that may say something too!"
3,Not as good as 1 & 2,"This was okay. I completed my collection and that is the only reason I bought this. The movie wasn't as good as 1 or 2.If you are thinking about buying this, don't. Just rent the movie and see for yourself."
3,"The Santa Clause 3, Send the Clausinator","This is now old pretty much. I loved the first two movies, but this storyline is getting worn out. It is certainly watchable and Allen, Short, and the rest the cast do a good job acting. It just doesn't have very much good belly humor. I hate to say it but I hope this is the last in the line. If you have the other two you may want to add this to your set. Otherwise it's a rental. It won't get replayed as much as the first two. I for one miss David Krumholtz but I guess either he was to big for the part or his ""Numbers"" series kept him to busy."
3,Santa Clause 3,We purchased this for our children for Christmas. Everyone enjoyed it over the holiday season.
2,Very Mediocre,"There were so many positive reviews of this film, I figured it must be good. Plus, It had Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren as leads!! How could you go wrong, right?? This movie was so dated, so slow, and so boring it barely keeps you interested. Some reviewers made vague comparisons to ""The Godfather"", are you kidding me?? This is a far cry from any good gangster film. The potential of the story was very good, but the delivery, development, direction, and editing were horrible !!! At the end you know the who, but not the why??? Don't waste two hours of your time watching this, it's a BIG disappointment !!"
1,Too Pricey for Such a Yawner,"40 minutes into the story, it was as hard to pay attention to it as it was in the first few minutes. British suspense flicks are often taught and compelling, but this one moves too slowly and has too much aimless dialog. You pretty soon stop caring what's going on. Helen Mirren is a great actress, but you see little of her and way too much of the male lead who seems to have to hold the entire movie together. Advertising Mirren as primary is deceptive. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
3,Good but not great,"Don't be fooled: this is not in the same league as a Scorsese movie, or even a good American crime movie. It is interesting though, and Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren are great. Definately a change of pace - but it's not a classic."
1,Boring,"The best thing about this film is the soundtrack. 79 Euro disco and hypnotic psyche prog rock. I give the sounds track 5 stars.The movie itself. Not so good. Unless you like boring. none of the characters are sympathetic or fascinating. theres a lot of dead air where nothings is going on. the violence is sudden sadistic and revolting, and very rare. theres not much sense of impending doom or walls closing in. theres an obvious shakespear influence - but its no where close to that kind of quality. then tried to prop it up.the lead gangsters rant against americans at the end seems sudden and not really fitting with the theme of the film. there is a xenophobic undertone to the film - the bad guys are black, irish, or american.this one doesnt seem up to criterion quality. more like they licensed cheap back catalog. I could barely stay awake. My GF fell asleep in the first 20min. I held on hoping it was building to something... not really."
5,Crackling good dialogue and a great movie,"I first saw this movie about 10 years ago and was just blown away by Bob Hoskins' performance. It was the first time I had seen him in anything. I recently saw this Criterion DVD and, although the movie is not as flashy as newer Hollywood films, it makes up for it in it's pace and dialogue. Some scenes are funny in the midst of devastation and horror.The print of the film is very clean, although not anamorphic, and the sound is good. No real bells and whistles as far as surround sound goes, but I didn't miss it a bit. The story made up for it."
3,Clean up on lane 10,"Pierce Brosnan is a young bit player in this film as an IRA hit-man.The bombs start going off in London and the bodies start piling upin what at first appears to be a MOB turf war,but is actually a delivery gone bad?The acting is first rate here and we believe the London MOB with manners that we see. Soon after this era they started putting up cameras on all the London street corners. But the bobbies can still be bought?Labor in London is Irish in constructionand the paths cross in a very strange way."
5,Hoskins. One word that sums it up.,"I'm surprised this film isn't more highly regarded than it is. I'd never even heard of it before perusing a magazine article about the PS2 game 'The Getaway', which listed its top inspirations from British gangland cinema. Along with Michael Caine's 'Get Carter,' 'The Long Good Friday' properly catches the grit and chagrin of 1970s Britain. Though Hoskins' Harold Shand has raised himself to a different level of the food chain than Caine's Carter. He's a man living in the past, still enamored by the Bentley motors, fat Cuban cigars, the pomp and trappings of a once-was empire as the modern age crashes in around him. Anyway, great film. Keep an eye out for P.H. Moriarity (Hatchet Harry in 'Lock Stock'), Paul Freeman (Belloq of 'Raiders' fame), and a gum-chewing Pierce Brosnan in his first on-screen role."
5,Harold's dilema,"This film possibly deserves to be in the one of the best gangster movies made club. If your collection includes Godfather 1&2, Scarface,Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction then this movie is for you. ( you sick person !) Filmed in London with advice from genuine East End Crims on how they would handle various situations, this film follows the last 36 hours of Harlod Shand as the provisional IRA decide to get even. The only problem is Harold does not know who is having a go at him or why. Don't expect fancy special effects etc, this is a movie that is made in the real world and hits the spot. I love the scene when Harold is walking through Heathrow Airport. Harold's right hand man Razors is just brilliant and the performance by Bob Hoskins as Harold is unforgetable. Some of the verbal is brilliant ! For sure this is one for the collection !"
4,a cool film with great music,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD version of the film.This film is a bit different for me given that Bob Hoskins is in it. The first film with Bob Hoskins I saw was ""Who framed roger rabbit"" I had seen it countless times before seeing this and have thought of his faked American accent in that film to be his normal one. Seeing this film, where he does a Cockney British accent is more unusual than his regular British accent.The film starts with the unexplained murder of several people. We later learn that they all are members of a Harold's (Bob hoskins) gang. He begins to have difficulty running his gang and trying to close a deal with another gang.The film also has a short appearance by Pierce Brosnan in one of his very first film roles. 007 fans would know him best.The DVD only has the British and American theatrical trailers as special features."
5,Classic British gangster Noir,"Classic, is the performance of Bob Hoskins both powerful and charming, a London gangster at the top of his tree and looking to move up runs inadvertently into a darker realm of power, so notorious that even the mafia run for cover. With a fantastic score and supporting performances from the likes of Helen Mirren the Long Good Friday ranks amongst the finest of British film."
4,"good movie, good atmosphere, british accent difficult to understand","I appreciate this movie, a good script, a great story, well acting but the language....wow, very difficult to understand the subtility. Too hard for me"
4,You and Bob are just as confused,"You know more about what has happened than mob boss Bob Hoskins, but you have to learn more about him and his operation to piece it all together. Makes you pay attention. As the various scenes go by you and Bob know more about what's happening, but... Very interesting, has good theme music, and a bit part by pre-Remington Steele Pierce Brosnan."
1,Counterfeit product,Kinerase don't make this product any more. I found out too late that Kinerase should only be bought from Kinerase Authorized Dealers. I purchased it recently from another reseller and I got no more than a bottle of water.
5,Wonderful Ring set!,"I adore this ring set. I wear it every day since I got it, about 3 months ago now, and it is still as beautiful as the day I got it in the mail. The only time I take it off is if I am working with bleach. There has been no tarnishing or discoloration, and I have gotten so many compliments and people asking me how much money it set me back to buy it. I just smile and say it was worth every penny. The only thing to be careful of is the sizing. I have large fingers, and my ring finger is a 10 from most sellers. Well since I have purchased rings from this seller before, I knew they ran a little big so I got a size 9. It is still a little loose on me, although not enough to fall off. So be careful when choosing a size, and get a size or even two smaller than what you normally wear. But I can not rave enough about this ring set, and all of the jewelry I get from this seller! A+++++!!!"
1,You Get What You Pay For....,"And isnt that the truth. My original wedding set was lost on vacation. I am not a big jewelery person anyway, and I dont care to wear diamonds at all. I bought this because it was cheap, pretty, and simple. The engagement ring is well enough, I actually get compliments on it all the time. but the wedding band ring, all the stones are falling out, on all sides, so I cant even turn the bad side underneath my finger. Its atrocious. I appreciate that there are companies out there making things like this for people who can not necessarily afford it. But so much quality is sacrificed. I have to buy another set. But, my shipment came on time, the ordering was hassle free...."
2,disappointed!,After looking online at thousands of CZ rings I choose this one because I thought I would like the thinness of the band. I was so disappointed when I opened my package today. My first thought was it looked cheap and fake and almost bubble gum machine looking. The center stone is way too big for me and it sets up really high. I can imagine it knocking into everything and getting in the way. The stones go around the whole band and even with the thinness of the band it's too wide between the fingers and the stones scratch the inside of each finger touching the ring. This ring will be going back. Beware...this would be a hard ring to pass off as real looking! Also the picture of the ring is deceiving; I think it looks nothing like the picture. Shipping was very quick!
5,Great debut!,"This first novel by Nancy Herkness is a standout. Her characters are full developed, the plot never drags, the emotions are deep. I thoroughly enjoyd it."
2,Only if you do a lot of orthopedic surgery!!!,"I purchased this book thinking that it would be helpful to me as an emergency room nurse.....its not! The forward of this book was written by the author who explains that he is an emergency orthopedic trauma surgeon and he collected phrases for use in his practice and then turned them into a book....that is exactly what he did, so unless you are an orthopedic trauma surgeon then this book would be a waste of your money.Many of the phrases included relate to bone injuries, forget having any questions related to chest pain, abdominal pain, or any other common emergency room complaint. Many of the phrases are redundant. The book is also poorly organized which makes finding any specific phrase or question difficult.I would not recommend this book."
3,"Really good, but very repetitive","I love this album for the diversity of the sound he got, and how the songs go from really hard rock, to a countryish-blues mix. The only flaw i found was that he was very repetitious after awhile of listening to the album as a whole. He starts off firing with all cylinders with ""Damaged"", and that song is good. and then the next couple are almost as hard. Then he completely does a 360 and plays a straight up banjo countryish-blues song. its great but he keeps that idea for the rest of the record, which i though got kinda stale after hearing the country sound twice more after the first song i mentioned. ""Blues Balls"" was the highlight for me considering thats my favorite genre to play, or listen to, being that i play guitar. but overall recommended if ur into hard rock constantly and then a slow song occasionally."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!,This is one of the greatest instrumental albums i've ever heard.Those of you who dont like it it's cause you just dont have a good taste in music.Both Vertigo And Songs For Sanity Rocked.I love every single song.I recommend it to anyone who is open minded about music.
3,LJH Idaho,"This is a very heavy film. Definitely NOT for young viewers. Surprise ending. Sam Elliott is always great to watch; he is devious in this film and that was hard for me to watch. I like him better as a hero or in a western. He has made quite a few non-westerns in which he plays a semi-bad ""good guy"". This one keeps you on the edge of your seat."
3,judge for yourself,The movie did catch my eye.the movie did not hold me to the tv like Sam Elliot usually does.Can't recommend but if you are a Sam Elliot fan get it.
4,Grill with Bunn Warmer,Great for the single person or mabye even a couple.Would like one a bit larger (4 buggers or chops)also with bunn warmer.Unable to locate a larger one on this site.
3,Too small,"This grill is quick and easy to use and clean, but will only accommodate 1 sandwich or piece of meat (besides hot dogs) without making a mess. It would be ok for one person, but if you're cooking for 2 you should look for a larger George Foreman such as theGeorge Foreman GR19BWBC Contemporary Design Grill with Bun Warmer, Blackwhich we recently upgraded to. It seems like the bun warmer lids on most GF grills break off easily, and ours was done for a long time ago. The bun warmer almost works better without the lid, though. Even if you're just cooking for 1, I'd recommend going with a GF grill that's a little bigger and nicer."
5,Very useful!!,Great item to have for quick meals and healthy cooking. Right size for one person. Can be used anywhere there is an electric outlet. Great for college student as it can be easily used in dorm room for a quick meal or hot snack.
3,Power switch,"Power switch? What are the designers thinking, no switch?I would like to know how many of the designers have lights in their home that they have to plug in to turn on & unplug to turn off? Do they plug in their microwave to turn it on? How about their stove, mixer, etc....?"
5,I hope I get a new one for Christmas!,"This appliance was an absolute dream while it lasted! The down side of this was its not dog proof. My dog decided that good things came from it so he took it off the counter and broke it into pieces one day while I was at work. It is possible that given the fact that soap is not to be used there was some residual smells of the burgers the day before and he just had to have it... So now i'm hoping for a new one for Christmas and I promise to keep it on the top shelf. Oh, how I miss it already."
2,Good Idea,"Its to small, and cant be submerged in water. It cooks the meat very well, sometimes the meat gets to dry. Needs to be bigger and be able to put in dishwater to wash."
1,Get the upgraded grill with the removable plates instead.,"I wish I had. This one goes to the Goodwill. Grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean. Grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular, like a chicken breast. Hamburgers work best. Watch out for burns!"
4,Love it!!,"I love this little thing. It cooks hamburgers in no time! its a fast and easy way to make some lunch or dinner for yourself or someone else. If you let it cool down it might be hard to clean it up, so remember to clean it up right after use. I also love the bun warmer. It's the right temperature so it wont burn your buns while your cooking your hamburger."
4,Hot tasty meals - FAST!,"I just couldn't resist this purchase when it showed up in my gold box, especially at the price.The grill is a little smaller than I imagined it, but it surely grills meat FAST. I could hardly believe the meat was cooked already. Fish may stick to the plates, so you may want to use some PAM before you place anything on the grill. Cleaning is no problem.This is well worth the money, and makes a great gift for someone who lives on their own or has space constraints."
3,It Really Works!!,"I love the idea of the grill & it really does work; however I am giving it only 3 stars. The product itself is wonderful & would be good for winter days or those of us w/ small apartments, etc. And it does cut down cooking time by about 1/2 or more.If you are a big ""fish"" person, I would not suggest using this grill. My husband & I received it as a gift & everything was great until we used it for salmon. We cleaned it extremely well, as usual, but the next time we used it for something else, the salmon smell seeped into our kitchen & food; also had the salmon taste. The grills are pourous, so if you plan on cooking a lot of different items, I would reccommend the grill w/ the removable plates so you can soak them. Not sure if anyone else had this trouble, but trust me, we CLEANED it."
3,Cleaning,"I have had a George Forman for a year while I was away in school. The George Forman Grill is a great idea, but wasn't designed very well. If you poke holes into your meat, salt and pepper it, and put it onto the grill... it tastes great. I sometimes burnt the meat, but being a college student, I didn't buy that expensive of meat, so I didn't care. The only thing I disliked about the Forman was cleaning it! It was horrible to clean, and I despised doing it (which meant I didn't use it very often). But, when I did, I had a method of cleaning it. So, it works out for the better. I hope this review has helped anyone who wants to buy the George Forman Grill. Oh, and yes, I went out and bought another one (the big one) because this one is too small!"
4,"overall, pleased","because of the diet that I am on, and the limitations of my meat preferences, I was overall pleased with the way that it cooked the meat that I put in it. my only concern was with the teflon coating that after the first use, I noticed that a very small piece came off. I don't know if it will keep coming off or not. but it did not dry out the meat, and as long as I was watching it, did not burn it."
4,Cooking with flair,"I have have found that in this sometimes dismal existence we forget that life is exciting and colorful. Even the smallest thimgs should reflect these standards. The grill saves time which is precious and heathy,now it spices up a kitchen that was just missing something (color)."
3,We all need a lift!,"The concept of this grill is wonderful, but I wish the lid had more of a lift at the back, for thicker cuts, such as filets, burgers and lamb chops. I find that, because the slant, to drain the fat is at such an angle, the lid doesn't completely cover the top of the item being cooked, and the food isn't evenly grilled."
4,"Great grill, not big enough for 4 burgers but great for 2","This is an excellent grill. I have heated up burgers, hot dogs and also toasted grill cheese sandwiches.This item is non stick. Only really holds 2 burgers of a good size, will not hold 4. No matter just takes an extra couple of minutes. Bun warmer is good, no fun eating a hot burger on an ice cold bun (teeth will chatter !). I like this grill, does not occupy to much space on kitchen counter, easy to clean and works!In short this item would replace a sandwich maker AND acts as a griller. Excellent as a single buy (good price) to fit both tasks (sandwich maker and grill for heating burgers, hot dogs. George Foreman is also a great guy and this is a good endorsed product."
1,Too Hot!,This low price point grill does not do a very good job with delicate fish. It overcooks the outside before the inside is edible. It also did not grill steak adequately. The same senario as the fish -- outside overcooked before grilling is complete. I would recommend buying a higher priced model is you are serious about countertop grilling!
3,NOT a real grill!,"Well, this item does serve a purpose, but if you want a real grill and real grill taste, don't expect it here. It's more like a teflon coated waffle iron. It's good for indoor cooking of 1 or two pieces of chicken, hamburger, pork roll, etc.. but don't expect to get any authentic barbecuing done."
5,Loooooooove It!,"My wife received this as a gift from my mother for her birthday. I didn't even know that my wife wanted one of these things--besides as I learned awhile back, I try to steer clear of any type of kitchen appliance as a birthday gift--no matter how practical the gift, it is not received with much appreciation ;)So far she has used it to cook perfect burgers in 5 min., moist porkchops, and grilled tuna melt sandwhiches.Each item has come out great. The only downside has been that when gilling the sandwhich it squished the sandwhich a bit. This is because items must be 1"" thick to fit in between the two halves. The bread was perfectly toasted and it was fully heated throughout.It also cleans up quickly and easily. Just a quick wipe with a paper towel. It's small size makes it easy to store.I imagine the grill will be used often in our household!"
4,Not bad for the price,These were better than expected. Chicago Cutlery is a great started set for knives. I would buy these again.
1,Obsolete,I have had this dictionary for many years and always relied on it. But after seing theNew Lakota DictionaryI agree that this one is completely obsolete.
3,pretty good,"The sweet story of a family's love, a young woman's desire to please the Lord, and her fiancé's journey toward Christ, A Promise for Ellie is inspiring and refreshing. Snelling's ability to create compelling dialogue holds the reader's attention, as do the bits of unique Scandinavian culture harmoniously spliced into this poignant tale.Ideal for an evening in front of a roaring fire, A Promise for Ellie will take you back one hundred years to the rugged life of the northern plains, and leave you clamoring for more."
4,A Promise for Ellie,"My wife says she liked the book very well. She said it is very,very, very, very, very, very, very good."
4,Daughters of Blessing,"I haven't read any of the Red River Valley books so even though I'm kind of picking up in part two of one long saga, these books really are excellent. Luaraine Snelling paints the scenes in such a distinctive way, you can almost feel, smell, and even just sense the rooms, rivers, and farms that the story takes place in. I definently reckomend this if you really want to get inside a book."
4,Very good,"Very good filter. Have used several times. It needs a prefilter, but I simply solved that by wrapping a coffee filter around the end of the tube with a rubber band. Works like a charm and takes out a lot of the bigger particles. Had not had any problems with this filter after over a year of use."
3,Not very impressed with performance of these shocks,"Good deal for a low budget adjustable shock, but there are better ones out there for the performance minded people. You get what you pay for I guess! It is nice to have the lifetime warranty though since most aftermarket performance shocks do not do that."
1,Buyer beware,"When ordering from Amazon beware you may receive one shock absorber (and be billed) while the second shock of a pair is back ordered even though they indicated it was avaialable when you ordered. Beware! Be certain that you do NOT check the default box to ship items individually. I have been billed for three and have the fourth on backorder. I have learned a lesson not to rely on Amazon when I need a product immediately.This is not a criticism of the specific product, but it is a criticism of the Amazon policies and service. I have been a loyal Amazon customer and will continue to purchase items that are not time sensitive. I cannot rely on their representations of availability."
4,Great Music from a Great Band,"This group never ceases to amaze me. I onw most of their cd's and this on is definitely one of their best. The sound is a little different than their other stuff, but it is for the better. I can't wait till they tour here in Southern California!! This CD is a necessity to any collection because while it is punk, it has great musical quality. Also, the guitarists are some of the best ones in the world."
4,Samsung WEP410 Headset,"This stylish in-the-ear Bluetooth headset has great sound quality, is very unobtrusive and, when purchased through Amazon.com, is a very good price. I recommend it highly if you don't endlessly use a cell phone (4 hrs of talk time)."
4,Great Samsung Product,Before purshasing this headset I did my share of research. I ended up buying this one because of its small size and its price. I am happy to report that it was a GREAT buy. Even after accidetally puting it in the washing machine it works great. Great buy
2,Lousy product,Pro:-Works with the Samsung BeatCon:-Don't stay in your earl well even in sitting still position.-Occasionally hear echo of yourself.-Take too long to turn ON/OFF (8-10 sec).-Volume buttons not sensitive enough to adjust easily.-Call button is over sensitive and have accidentally make calls without realizing.
1,Do not buy,"The sound is mediocre, the comfort is as well. The construction though is awful. It broke within a week. Spend the extra 10 bucks on the flip motorola or even an older model jawbone"
3,good product but beware who you buy from some are fake.,"i just bought this amazon and it was a fake version of the WEP410 bluetooth. It worked but it didn't charge. It said ""Anycall"" on the box verifying that it was fake no authenticity sticker or anything. Buttons were black instead of silver and it did not come with the extra ear plugs. BEWARE!!!!!! i'm furious I thought I was getting a deal."
2,All the people I called hated it.,"Nuff said in title. I could hear everyone else clearly, but the people I called said i faded in and out all the time. I tried to return this item but the merchant refused the return. ZenithMobile. I don't blame them, really, because they sold at a rock bottom price. It will just sit in a drawer charged up in case I some day need it desparately. I had the same call clarity problems on my Motorola RAZR V3M as I did on my Samsung M520."
2,"It may be fine for some, but it should come with a stapler.","I generally enjoyed my two other Samsung Bluetooth headsets. This one will not stay in the ear. Got it? Yes, the volume buttons are not very user friendly. Yes, it's too easy too redial someone with the main button. But keep in mind, this one will not stay in the ear. Three sizes of adapters; four different ears. They sound quality was sometimes questioned by the other parties on the line (""Huh?""), but more importantly, this one will not stay in the ear. Maybe we have stupid ears, but Amazon is gracious enough to let me return it post paid."
1,okay game,"i have seen the previews of this game.the market is to strong with other football games and NFL 2K2 will plumit to the bottom.reviewed by,a concerned viewer"
5,Awesome,"When I owned a dreamcast, NFL 2k is what really got me into football, it was perfect. Want more on that game? Read a review of it. As for this game, it's even more perfect. The passing game is flawless. Simply flawless. Maxium passing is one of the coolest features ever, in any game. The running game is also very good. The commentary is top notch. Get this game, that's all I can say."
3,2K2 on the run...,"The running game is the best part of this SEGA entry into the XBOX arena. The beefy graphics make this game a heavyweight contender for gamers who hate wasting money on schmucky, over advertised and over-glitzed software. This version was faulted only because of the inaccuracies noticed during slo-mo playback where a passed ball (pro-mode) clearly went through a defensive line-backers arm yet was not tipped and for a bad call in which the ball (obviously advanced over the goal line on a 4th down conversion attempt) and before the player's knee hit the ground was called short. Unless ""bad calls"" were written into the software these inaccuracies are not new to those who jusy like playing but for serious fun, these are things that should've advanced with the graphics capabilities of the hardware and with the asking price. Demoed it, bought it, like it."
3,NFL 2k2 Disappointment,I am no pro reviewer - just a former Dreamcast NFL 2K1 player that was excited to 'upgrade' to NFL 2K2 on the XBOX.Needless to say I am not impressed with what I found in Sega's latest edition of this (formerly) great football game. My initial impression was that Sega rushed this title to the XBOX. NFL 2K2 has way too many graphic and motion problems for a game series this mature and a platform this advanced. On top of the glitchy game play the menu controls don't 'feel' right. When you use the left analog stick to call plays and navigate the menus the cursor moves back to the center of the screen rather than stay locked on the menu/play selected. It doesn't sound like a big deal but it is distracting and down right annoying.My suggestion is that you rent this game before you buy it. I wish I had . . . .
5,The Best Football Game Ever Made,"This game is the best football game ever made seeing the ther is a series for this game just like madden, but unlike madden the player are fluid where as on madden the players are stiff and have always been stiff just like in the 2000 and 2001 version of the game, if i could i would give NFL 2K2 an 11 because of the fluidness of the players and Madden NFL 2002 a flat out 3 because of the stiffness of the players."
3,Okay overall,I have one simple thing that makes maddem better. FRANCHISE MODE. The frachise mode on 2k2 is not very good. The depth and all the thought that is in Maddens Frachise mode is what makes it so great. I dont even play games a lot of the time. I am more a stragedy general manager type.Graphics and gameplay are better than Madden yes but the frachise mode will always make madden better. The graphics for madden could always be made better.
2,Way to computerized,Ihave this game for dreamcast and x-box and it's graphics are nothing compared to madden 2002. The players look nothing like the real thing and look way to computerized.The other problems with this game are:1.No helmet popping hits2.Players do not actually grip the ball3.No big hit replays4.Impossible to tackle even the smallest running backs on all-pro while it is way to easy to tackle on rookie and pro5.The orange cones in the end zone do not move when a player hits itAlso the market for football games is way to strong and madden will be on top while NFL 2k2 is on the bottom.
1,did anybody ever buy this rob base's career was dead,"wack album it was all about deAthrow, ruthless, rap a lot and gaNGSTER RAP BY 94 ANYWAY. ROB MADE A WACK ALBUM THAT KILLED HIS CAREER ANYWAy."
2,Nice camera shots but lacks substance,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but this film just doesn't compare to today's standards for nature documentaries. Also, the little narration it has is hard to understand. It sounds like the guy is talking through a tin can or something. The movie consists mostly of birds flying, which sounds cool but lacks depth as gets kind of repetitive. I do appreciate the effort it took to make this film, but it's for bird watchers only. A rental at best."
5,WINGED MIGRATION,"TRULY AMAZING FOOTAGE,HD QUALITY EXCELLENT..I RECOMMEND IT TO NATURE LOVERS ALL OVER THE WORLD..MOST AMAZING SCENES..GREAT FOR RELAXATION...BUY IT ON HD....."
5,The evilness of the film studios,"This gorgeous film about birds is done a disservice by the motion picture industry. It was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2001. In the US, it was released on November 18, 2003. That means that it was released on DVD in the UK three years, eleven months, and eighteen days before it was released on DVD in the U.S. This just goes to show how much regard the film industry has for documentary films, especially one that trumps most of the special-effects-laden, vacuous, empty action films that are turned out every summer to entertain the masses with mindless violence and cheap (in quality and effect, not in price) computer wizardry.This film should have been available on DVD much earlier in the U.S. for the American public to enjoy in their homes."
3,"OK, But",The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful. The makers of this film was able to get close to these migratory birds. If you want to see a film that just shows the beauty of nature then this is a good film. As far as natural history and ecology it is exremely laking. The only ecological information that is given is the destination and origin of these birds and the distance they travel. There is no or very little dialogue. There is no information on the ecology of these birds. I have a background in WIldlife Management and I am familiar with the North American birds. I would like to find out about the ecology of Eurasian or Old World birds. No information was given. Most people do not realize what these birds need to do to accomplish these migrations each year.
5,Nothing short of Orgasmic,"Was just flipping through the channels when I came across this masterpiece playing on Discovery. An exceptional musical score and aerial shots mesh perfectly. It feels as though you take flight with them across the sky. We see them communicate with sounds as well as body language. Each species seems to take the personality of a human equivalent. It reminds us of the beautiful view from which they see the world. As well, it gives a solemn reminder of the impact we have upon them. We would live in a much better world if all facets of the world were able to be caught with such reverance. A must see."
2,Wished filmakers trusted original idea more,"Spoilers below...The movie has stunning images and it's at its best when showing animal behavior. Unfortunately there are too many 'birds in distress' scenes, with the distress usually coming by way of humans, which take us out of the world of the birds and into the world of a 'message' movie.Spoiler: distress scenes like hunting, drowing in oil, caged for market, about to be run over by a combine.If these scenes were fewer and shown in matter-of-fact manner, maybe I'd have liked the film better. But the reaction shots of the birds were obviously picked for their emotive quality, and the music played during these scenes is overly leading, so that the effect tends toward smugness.I wished the filmakers would have stuck to showing the incredible alien beauty of birds and their behavior in a more straightforward manner. The 'story elements' of death and distress worked against what they should have been going for."
3,"Stunning Vistas, Typically French","Fantastic landscapes, complete with the obligatory French swipe at America. The one and only scene in the film which depicts wild birds being shot out of the air by hunters takes place in, you guessed it...According to the film's credits:""The hunting scene was filmed in North America, on sites where it takes place every year.""As if the sport of bird hunting is somehow limited to North America, or was introduced to the world by North America.And Duck L'Orange isn't a French dish?At least for me, the swipe detracted greatly from this otherwise wonderful film."
3,A Very Skillful and Elegant Anti-American Visual Hate-Fest,"An entertaining and interesting movie, but not nearly as good as I'd hoped. It gets downright funny when they reach the shores of the Great Satan, and suddenly all the birds are getting shot down by Evil White Gun-Toting Republican Hunters and Smothered In Oil and so on. You can almost here the crew muttering in the background, ""Come on you stoopeed behrd, go eento zee oil! We are falling behind on zee scheduelle!""And then there's the glorious shot of a wounded bird (not in the US) that gets devoured by flesh-eating crabs. A wonderful bit of 'verite', that, but one that reeks of a 'setup' to me.Where's PETA when you really need them?As a scientific/artistic physical study of animals in flight, however, the film is a must-see."
1,Never received item,"Hard to review this item, since the company I purchased it from just sent me a cancellation notice...aaarghhh -- so close to Christmas!"
2,French Art,"I saw both the original version a couple of years ago and the US release.I was wondering whether this film would be released in the US at all. There are a lot of glowing reviews by people who enjoy the cinematography. Fine. But the film (NOT a documentary) really has a problem and that is its ""message"". You prepare to see beautiful scenes of birds in flight, love them, only to be shocked again, and disappointed. Over and over....I thoroughly liked the REAL documentary, how they made the movie. The film itself is French Art, let's leave it at that."
4,Beauty on the Wing,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this film, recommended by a friend. It started slowly and at first I thought it was going to be slow and a low budget also ran. But it quickly got into its main theme, the migration of birds worldwide. Although the film hasn't got the power of some documentaries, the delight for me was the amazing filming. You are literally flying with the birds over the most stunning countryside, wing beat by wing beat. How this was done without the noise of helicopters or of planes flying alongside I don't know. But you can hear the whistle of wind and the sound of the wings beating the air.So if being able to observe living creatures in this way awakes wonder in you, this is a film to watch."
5,Visual Masterpiece!,"This movie is not a classic documentary, but rather is a stunning visual work of art. If your primary desire is a mass of statistical information about birds, look elsewhere. But the rest of us can become totally immersed in the lives of these birds in a way that is not possible with typical documentaries. It is emotionally enthralling and is a visual masterpiece. By ""tagging along"" with the different species as they migrate we enjoy breathtaking views of geography and gain a whole new compassion for the bird's ability to endure vastly different weather conditions. Now as I gaze above when birds pass over, I have a whole new appreciation for their lives.I highly recommend this film for nature lovers!"
1,winged migration is pointless,"i have watched many documentaries, i find them extremely interesting. but this was just ""hey. look at birds!"" while that truly was magical for about ten minutes, and the movie is gloriously shot, in the end it is nothing but watching birds. now i am all for watching birds, but i guess because there is such promise and occasionally facts are narrated that one assumed there is going to be a point to it all and there just isn't. or an insight about birds that will amaze, nope. and then there is the problem with the moments of complete set up (the boy by the lake) that seem bizarrely orchestrated.while i can't knock the look or the interest in birds that the film shows, in the end it's lack of any and all defintion hurt it for me. if watching birds for 90 minutes is your bag it'll be great for you."
4,"Best content, but don't buy DVD if you have HDTV","Watched it on TV in Hi-def. Really striking content. Amazing camera mastery.So I buy the DVD from Amazon.But DVD playback on my 50' HDTV is disappointing, at best. Picture quality is unacceptable.Advise: buy HD disc, don't waste your money in DVD."
4,Magnificent,"This film drags just a little in spots, but not a lot. It is an otherwise EXCELLENT film. If you love birds, nature, this film is for you...EXCELLENT. Beautiful photography, stunning birds."
1,A cartoon that uses birds for props,"This film is a series of staged scenes with trained birds. It has almost no informational content. The footage of the trained birds is very beautiful, but even so, there is just so much trained bird footage I am willing to watch, especially when the film makes belabored points about human encroachment by actually putting a plastic six pack ring around a bird's foot, etc. While the film claims ""no special effects"", it has computerized effects, blue screen shots, and of course, elaborate staged scenes using trained birds like the escape of a captured Amazonian parrot back into the wild. Birds were shipped to Africa and plopped in the desert for desert scenes. This is more like a cartoon that uses birds for props."
3,SORELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!,"I was so elated to watch this movie again last evening, that I almost ordered it on DVD. I taped my own VHS copy many years ago and periodically I will watch it.However, after reading some of the lower score reviews I am astounded about how this movie was filmed. I was so excited upon my first viewing back in 2003 that I wrote a poetic short story about the movie. DUUUUHH! Did I honestly believe this was a 100% accurate tale about birds migrating. YES, YES, YES!! Guess I should have done a little more homework! Well, I'll have to retract some of this information I gave to my 5 year old. All in all I did enjoy the movie(scratch the word documentary) and now I will search the web for a real documentary about migrating birds. Oh, I did enjoy the background music too.I want to thank all you lower scoring reviewers for OPENING MY EYES TO THE REAL TRUTH!!Thanks,Zula"
5,"All of the above 5-star reviews, plus...","don't forget, the magnificent soundtrack, available on amazon.com separately, including the exclusive song: To Be By Your Side, by Nick Cave."
4,Insanely great documentary,"How on earth do you get to fly side by side with a flock of geese, film them across continents, and yet they do not disperse in terror? You gotta to see this film to find out. Up close and personal, it almost makes you think you can also fly. It also gives you a new appreciation and respect for out feathered friends. Awesome!"
5,This movie is awe-inspiring,"Gorgeous cinematography of flying birds is what you'll find in this beautiful film. Your spirit will be lifted by this film. Some of the shots are really breathtaking. This is one of the very few life-affirming films ever created. The only other films that I can think of are ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Life is Beautiful (La vita è bella)"", and ""Forrest Gump"". Watch this film and be amazed by what you see.The soundtrack is soothing and quite beautiful. The music that accompanies the return of the cranes has a few notes played by a woodwind instrument that always remind me of some notes played by either a woodwind or brass instrument during the ""Et songe bien, oui, songe en combattant/Qu'un oeil noir te regarde,"" passage of the Toreador Song from Bizet's opera ""Carmen""."
2,And then we had their livers with a wonderful Bordeaux,"Nice film until you realize that the film-makers bred no small number of birds to be actors. I wonder what behind-the-scenes cinema verite we didn't see in ""The Making Of""? To be frank, it did look like the film crew had a very deep affection for the animals--but on the other hand, they then allowed their ""babies"" to be shot? I don't get it. And what happend to all these ""imprinted"" birds when the filmmaking was done?Maybe I'll just go back to watching Sir David Attenborough's ""The Life Of Birds"" series on PBS.Great cinematography. No guilt."
4,Winged Migration,"My husband and I really like this DVD,even though there were less than kind reviews because it is supposedly not completely shot ""in the wild"". The scenery and the story are quite spectacuar especially for bird lovers."
5,Winged Migration,"FABULOUS! This is absolutely the most amazing nature filming/cinematography I have ever seen. The opening sequence alone had my jaw dropping, you were flying up in the sky right next to the birds, YOU are flying. And it is not just about birds, the scenery is breathtaking. I have bought it for many gifts, it works for all ages."
3,"2.5 Star Really, A Nice Effort that Falls Short","If you are awaiting the documentary reincarnation of Robert Flaherty, you will be disappointed. While the film unconsciously shows us what birds do, it never succeeds in imparting a broader understanding of the great Winged Migrations of its title. After a while, all the birds started to look the same (most weren't very colorful). Most of the film focuses on the movement of birds in the Northern hemisphere, and only touches on the Southern hemisphere birds hurriedly towards the end of the film. Do the Southern hemisphere birds also migrate Southward? Northward? Why or why not? It mentions others who migrate in different directions, but quickly and without direction.This was a beautiful and enjoyable film. I did not feel at all bad about watching it for two hours. I would buy it (on sale). But it fails to be truly enlightening and its not going to make my top ten list for 2002, let alone the decade."
3,very disappointed,"As an avid birder, I anxiously awaited the release of this dvd. The birds themselves are glorious as well as the scenery. Narration is kept at a bare minimum, stepping in only to tell species names and distances they migrate. I was bewildered, but intrigued the first hour and a half until a decoy was placed in a lake and several goose were shot down from the sky. Then came a baby penquin screaming while being eaten by a pair of gulls. Now mind you, I know this is nature & migrating birds face such peril every year, but it seemed to veer way off from the overall theme of the film. Many segments were disjointed. My point: if you want to watch birds flying through every part of the globe & get a ""birds eye view"" then this film is for you. If your looking for a story or a show to educate you about the habits or scientific aspects of birds, try David Attenboroughs ""Life of Birds"", the epitome of bird documentaries."
1,"no context, just same pictures over and over","An utter disappointment! 90 minutes of flying birds, mainly geese, and virtually no explanations given, other than how far they migrate, as if it was a competition who travels furthest. No explanation about the migratory patterns, the specific life cycle of the birds mentioned, sometimes birds are featured and not even named. It is very much like a silent movie, except for the awful background music, but it definitely is not a documentary. Maybe they should have hired an ornithologist as adviser for the movie! I learned absolutely nothing from this movie!"
2,Eric,"I have seldom recommended a film to friends with such wholehearted enthusiasm. It is a remarkable, exquisite film. Don't miss the experience."
3,"Very enjoyable, Fantastic Filmwork, a little long","This style of filming birds in-flight was something that I've never seen before, and it was really amazing. Especially when they panned around the birds as they were flying.Even though they state that there were no special effects at the beginning of the movie, it looked to me like they did some compositing work to put the birds with various backgrounds. I count this as a special effect. I think what they meant was that none of the birds were computer-generated, which was true.There were 3 instances in the film where it was clear that a political statement was being made. I think it detracted from the film. The rest of the film was wonderous and a marvel to watch, and the political statements were out-of-sync with the otherwise non-political theme.The movie was too long. I was tired watching it at least 15 or 20 minutes before it ended."
4,What else can you say?,"In a word - *Magnificent*""Winged Migration"" does for migratory birds what ""March of the Penguins"" did for, well, penguins. The roughly hour and a half of video is simply spellbinding (and both my cats liked it as well as I did). The ""how we did it"" special features were all the more interesting after seeing the accomplishment.On reflection, I did reduce my rating to four stars from five, entirely due to two scenes where migrating geese are shot by ""hunters"", and one (although more natural) scene at the seashore where crabs are pursuing a wounded bird - with the implication that they succeeded. While these are very real threats that face the birds, the scenes are unnecessary and destroy the mood which has been established. When I get the tools I will edit them out of my copy."
5,Saw this on Discovery HD and had to have the Blu-Ray,"I have seen this three times now on Discovery Channel HD, and I am still in awe. I can't even imagine how most of this photography was done. You will see a side of our avian friends that has never been shown to this level of detail before. THe aerial shots are simply breathtaking, as is all of the photography. If the Blu-Ray disc is as good as the Discovery broadcast (and it should be better) then this will be a title to pull out for friends. You almost feel as though you are flying along with the animals.Some of the ""reality"" checks showing hunters and trappers are less fun to watch, but thankfully they are short and few. I have an absolutely new level of respect for our feathered friends after watching this. I am anxiously awaiting the Blu-Ray release.I would have preferred a release on HD-DVD, but since this is a Sony title that is impossible. ...a good indication of why it might be important to have both format players in your home!"
5,Awesome,If you are a nature lover this movie is for you. Some of the best cinematography on birds I have ever seen. This is truly a movie to own!!!
5,Excellent,I watch this video when I work out on my treadmill and recumbent bike. It is relaxing and time exercising floats by as I almost become one with the migratory fowl. Great video and excellent production.
4,Better than I thought,My dad made me buy this.I liked it more than I thought I would and my four year loved it!
4,Inflight Entertainment,"This is truly an amazing documentary that should have you greatly appreciating the incredible beauty, variety and endurance of these migrating birds. Often shot from the bird's perspective, you get the feeling of what it's like to actually be one of the birds flying right in their flock. One of the most remarkable aspects is the complete lack of sound of any craft tracking the birds. Coupled with the music, this is one highly inspirational film. Be prepared, however, to be subjected to some environmental politics as the producers are quite adept at finding the birds amidst a polluted backdrop from time to time, like in the Grand Canyon, but it's not overstated."
4,Spectacular Cinematography - BUT young children beware!,"An absolutely stunning spectacle. This documentary is a must see for anyone wishing to enjoy nature at it's finest. I do however caution parents that there is a harsh side to this film. I watched it with my 11 year old son who was VERY distraught over the hunting scene. (Threw the remote down and left the room in tears!)I was dismayed that this was not spelled out on the cover. With a G rating, it did not occur to me that there would be any area that I would have to be more watchful about. This scene can be tough for anyone who is unprepared, so be aware of that. I do, however, recommend this film. I had just wished that the film content had been spelled out more clearly, so as a parent, I was better prepared..."
3,Compromised Rating.,"The cinematography was spectacular, staged or otherwise. Five stars.The commentary was inane, distracting and less than informative. One star.Average...three stars, including the score.Many of the truly spectacular migratory feats were never mentioned; the Redknots, Bristled-thighed Curlews, Arctic Terns, etc. The film-makers would have done better to follow the paths of a few species in great detail, with the simple, raw facts of their mostly solitary journeys, which are astounding lessons in physiology, navigation, and a faith which transcends human understanding.Still...a visually stunning film for all who stop whatever they are doing to listen to and watch a flock of migrating geese, and especially for those who couldn't care less."
5,Fantastic,This is really a neat video. I ordered two copies for my sister. She wanted one for herself and a friend. I watched it on tv.
2,Wasn't my cup of tea,"I don't understand what the big deal is about this video. I'm a bird lover and with all of the hype, I was expecting a lot. Yes, the videography is interesting, but that's all this film has to it. I wouldn't consider it a documentary so much as an artsy film. In a documentary I would expect a lot more information about the birds and the hows/whys of migration, complemented by the video everyone is raving about. Instead, the film is focused on simply watching the birds fly (mostly geese) while providing little if any information about them. If this helps people otherwise not interested in birds learn something, then I think that's great. For birders interested in learning something more, I'd say it's a disappointment from a documentary perspective."
3,Beautiful - but disappointing,"This received such glowing reviews that I couldn't wait to watch it. The photography is absolutely stunning, no question, but I had hoped to learn more. For a start I would have liked the birds to be identified, especially since many appear to be European, and I am not at all familiar with them. One the other hand, if you want something lovely and soothing to lull you off to slumberland..."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"This is the best documentary I have ever seen. Although I am younger then 13 (so what?) I love spiritual stuff. This moved me. This is a great film for the soul, the eye, the ear, all of the senses."
5,Winged migration- a remarkable movie,"I saw this on the big screen, in a theatre.The experience of seeing these majestic birds in flight waswonderful.It was equally enchanting to have the opportunity to observe birds from other continents, birds we don't see in migration flight. The film-maker went to great pains to expose the viewer to a remarkable variety of migrating birds.As other reviewers have noted that the birds were recruited and imprinted, still I say that the experience of seeing these birds in flight is unbelieveably beautiful."
1,not a good read.....,"one of the wort assigned readings i have ever had to read for school! I wanted to put this thing down after about 20 pages in because i found it rather stupid but we had to do a formal review on this book so i was forced to read the the whole thing, not a very good book at all......"
2,poor audio,The group performance was good. Their harmony was great. The camera man could have used some training. It was more focused on one person at a time instead of the group. The dance steps and everything is what makes a great performance which we saw very little of on this dvd. The sound on the tv had to be turned all the way up. Some editing should have been done before it was released for sale.
1,Pure drivel!,"David Funderburk--the former history professor at the hardline Baptist Campbell University, one-term US Representative from rural North Carolina, protege of Sen. Jesse Helms and former Ambassador to Romania in the early '80s--is in the mold of those Red-baiters of the early '50s. He denouces the State Department as communist sympathizers and throughout the book belies his extreme right-wing Christian fundamentalist ideology. He is certainly correct that the Ceausescu regime was horrid, but that was not due to the State Department. His solution, end detente with all communists, has been tried time and again with failure. Funderburk obviously harbors a deep insecurity about his less than stellar academic career and that he was ostracized by everyone in the foreign policy making apparatus from George Schultz on down. If any book deserves less than a star, this is it."
5,Popular and well loved!,"Our 9-year-old loves to draw, and we gave her this book and the Doodle Dogs book for Christmas. She hasn't stopped using it since, and takes it to play with her friends, and they work on it together, and now she wants to give it as gifts to her friends! They use it to copy the drawings exactly, and to elaborate and create original ones with some of the basic elements. Directions are clear and concise, and probably appropriate for about ages 6 and up."
2,"Too much ideology, not enough actionable suggestions","It was kinda sad, because I couldn't even finish this book on CD. I almost made it through the first 2 CDs, and then I was done when the author started droning on and on and ON about the relationship that God wants for parents and kids and other fluffy stuff- and I AM a practicing Christian. I almost wanted to ask him if he had sat down for a cup of coffee with God and heard right from God all about what He wants from us. It irks me when people act like they know exactly what God wants.This book was waaay too wordy, only gave a couple of actionable suggestions for parents. Maybe I picked the wrong book for what I was going for. In my case, waste of money."
4,Barn Burner,"Loved it, this guy knows how to move. None of the boring lengthy descriptions of Jordan and none of the moralistic rantings of Goodkind. Just high speed fantasy, a nice breath of fresh air while waiting for the two aforementioned to get their next books to press. I find Farland's writing a little rough and lacking some explainations but since it moves along so quickly I can forgive that. Hopefully he'll get to some of that in future books."
5,Wizzardborn,I loved this book. It was exciting from beginning to end. I will defiantly order another of David Farland books.
5,Wizardborn from Amazon,"I purchased the second book in the series (without knowing it was part of a series) as a light, relaxing read the last hour or two before bedtime. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the 1st, 3rd, and 4th books in the series. Tightly woven tale of adventure in an alternate universe. I can recomend this for anyone who enjoys a good advventure story."
3,A let down,Compared to the previous 2 books a major letdown. Could have dropped 1/2 the content and had a good book.
3,OK,"I'm not really sure what's going on with those who thought this was 5 stars. Wizardborn was a bit annoying. I have to agree with another who thought Farland could have simply made this into a trilogy. Then perhaps this segment wouldn't have seemed so useless. I'm rather sick of Gaborn's character and hope he becomes more of a dynamic figure in the following books. What started out as having potential in The Runelords (despite it's cheezy cover), seems to be weakening."
1,Not as good as I expected,"I was disappointed in both this book and #2. I read the first book, then bought all 3 thinking this would be a good series to read. The author should have condensed all 3 into 1 book. It would have been much better. I was bored to tears by the middle of the second book and continued to plough through the second and almost all of this book before I finally gave up in frustration and tedium. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on any of them. I will be reluctant to buy any books by this author in the future. I wish someone had warned me."
4,"Write faster, Mr. Farland","If he finishes in 5 books, I will read 5. If he finishes the story in 500 books, I will read all 500. Hire a cook, hire a maid, hire a nanny, whatever you need- just please write faster, Mr. Farland.It's not the best book in the world, but it is the most compelling world created in a book since DeathGate.(Though- a summary would be helpful in the beginning since we have to wait 2 years between books.)Why are you reading this, Mr. Farland? Close this window and get back to writing!!!Thanks :)"
5,A Moving wonderful book,I'm keeping this book. Reading this book was an inspiring and spiritual experience. Mother Teresa and those that follow her have always interested me. How can people go into the world of the poor and stick with it. Read the book and find out! It's an eye opener.
5,very spiritual & deeply personnal,It was a book I really didn't want to put down. The writer was so articulate that at times I felt like I was with her on her journey.
5,Lorna Kelly's search to find herself is a true gem!,Lorna's ongoing path to self discovery is a wonderful read! That her path crossed Mother Teresa's makes this all the more special.
5,A very inpiring spiritual journey!,I just finished reading this book and find myself keep thinking about the spiritual journey the author took in her life. Through her extraordinary experiences I could recognize that she finally found her mission in her life. The book was so intriguing that it models us that it is possible for anyone who endures and sticks with the spiritual path will find the life's treasure. Made me very happy that she finally found herself blessed with a gift beyound her wildest dream! I recommend this book to anyone who is serching for a mission in him or her life.
5,Spellbinding,"Extraordinary spiritual and personal journey. The author brilliantly transported me to a world totally unknown to me and I was hooked. The author allows the reader to witness the loving and nurturing relationship she developed with Mother Theresa.. It was an honor to be a part of the lives of these two woman, if only for a brief time."

2,watch out for rust,"The press looks good at first glance. It has a wondful, solid feel and it worked wonderfully when I used it to cook bacon. So why the two stars?You have to hand wash and season the press with oil each and every time you use it. I didn't and simply tossed it in the dishwasher, and came out with a rust spotted press. It cleaned up easily enough, but maintaining the press will be a pain in the rear. You also can't use it on your non-stick pans because it will scratch the surface."
2,"Burger yes, Bacon no","It works with the first batch of bacon, but if you add a second batch the oils and fat flows from the sides and make a mess just like cooking it uncovered. It works good for burgers and steaks."
4,.good bacon press,"I ordered the bacon press and when my wife picked it up; she said, ""now this is a good one"". That says it all."
2,Product larger than listed size,"Product description says it's 9"", but it won't fit in my 10"" skillet.Also I've discovered the problems I've been having with bacon curling and shrinking like nobody's business and just generally not properly frying up are caused by the fact that producers are injecting more and more water into bacon, allegedly to ""improve flavor"". Bacon adulterated in this way cooks up nasty. The only way I've been able to get it to come out even remotely edible is actually to let it swim in the grease until it's finally done, cooking veeeeeery slowly on low to med low heat. It's still not as good as it ought to be, but I doubt this press would have helped solve the problem of grody bacon even if it HAD fit in my 10"" skillet."
5,Great utensil,"Perfect size and weight for a 12"" skillet. Keeps the bacon, chops flat for even frying while preventing any splatters. High quality materials. You won't cook bacon again without this indespensible utensil. Easy 5 stars for this great product."
4,"GREAT for intended use, NOT FOR USE WITH GRILL TOP CLOSED","ok - i use it to press meat when cooking on my cast iron in side, or on my grill outside.i was having a ""duh"" moment, and wasnt paying attention when i shut the lid to the gas grill with this inside.. well - i smelled some weird smoldering and your guess was right - the wood handle started smoldering inside.so, i DO say you SHOULD buy this, but dont close the grill lid!dont put in the oven!lodge logic makes an all metal one if you wanna do that."
4,Does the job!,"I originally bought this as a gift. I thought to myself ""Pfft, I can do the same thing with my other cast iron skillet. Just set it on top of the bacon I am cooking"". But it got to be a pain in the *you know what* to clean the bacon grease off of the bottom of the other cast iron skillet every time, so I broke down and got one for myself.As other users have stated, it's a good weight, evenly cooks the bacon, and has grooves that help expel the grease. I didn't even think of using it for sandwiches, what's wrong with me!? Now I have some more ideas on how to use this!The only reason it gets 4 stars is because the first one I bought, ended up having loose brackets, so I had to send it back and get a replacement. Which means having to wait to make perfect bacon. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
3,Like the size of this,This bacon press is a good size. Can't leave bacon presses on the whole time because they cause the bacon to steam but they are great to get a flat product.
4,Bacon press,Love it. A bit irritating to clean (isn't that pretty much always the case with bacon grease?) but it really does the job and is attractive enough that my wife doesn't object to having it sitting on the counter near the stove.
3,works well,Product worked well when used only problem was screws the came with it to attach handle were to small. Had to find some larger ones before usind it.
3,"Love the design, but be careful!","This is a great product and it has a fun design, but after cooking with it for a while you have to be really careful not to touch anywhere other than the handle; otherwise you'll be in for a surprise since the cast iron gets so hot."
2,Actually not that bad.,"Let's see if I got the plot to ""Candy Stripe Nurses"" correct. I believe it went something like this: topless woman, topless woman, naked woman, topless woman, naked woman, topless woman, 2(!!) topless women. There was also a subplot about one of the nurses trying to help a patient beat a charge of armed robbery.In all seriousness, I rather enjoyed parts of this movie. I know this is going to be hard to believe, but the acting by the women playing the nurses was wonderful. Usually the women in these types of movies simply have to speak English and look good without their clothes on. (Although sometimes the speaking English part isn't necessary.) Every one of the actresses in ""Candy Stripe Nurses"" did an admirable job and all of their characters were sympathetic ones. That really helped to partially overcome the cheesy plot. I've seen A LOT worse '70s movies similar to this one. Kinda fun little flick...but nothing that'll blow you away."
2,Lame,"That's the best way to explain this movie. Silly plot, bad acting, and a cheap way to sell sex. I mean, if you're going to sell sex, at least deliver. One of the worst movies in it's genre."
5,I Enjoyed Yoji Yamada's Samurai Films,"I find Yoji Yamada's samurai films to be a respite from some martial arts cinema. (Not all, of course, as long as a director can deliver the goods with a great story.) Yoji Yamada's three samurai films (the last, so far, being 'Love and Honor') are very unique, thorough, and down-to-earth type films. They are ground-level films rather than flying circuses. His films draw you into characters that are trying to survive troubles and conflicts that threaten their dreams of a quiet and honorable life. Thus, I find Yamada's explorations and dramas to be refreshing."
3,"MUTED, INTERESTING, UNUSUAL TAKE ON A SAMURAI'S LIFE","Mostly, this well-produced film is distinguished by a muted, naturalistic tone and good acting backing a logical script. But there's neither drama or action to recommend. It's just a uniqueview of a rather mundane aspect of a samurai's domestic life. In another context, it might bea soap-opera rendition of Samurai family life, traumas and all."
4,Useful for understanding causes of migration,"This video, while lacking the polish of studio works, really gets at the causes of migration as well as the incredible risks that migrants from Mexico take in order to provide a better future for their children. It is powerful in its simplicity. I've used this as a training tool with social workers, police officers, health care providers and others, and it always has been well received."
3,Let's Go Generically,"I received both the Let's Go Germany and the Let's Go Italy guides as gifts for my three months of travel, and, recognizing the ""Let's Go"" moniker, assumed the guides would be valuable. I was wrong.The hostel picks proved to be American frat party hang-outs and the sights listed could be found in any other guidebook or in the tourist information pamphlets handed out in train stations. Most of the restaurants listed had either closed or changed management (resulting in higher prices) and most of the unique, out-of-the-way listings were impossible to find because the directions provided were as descriptive as ""take the U-Bahn to Rotkreutzplatz and go east.""One redeeming element of the guides were the pension listings, which were usually accurate. However, if you can afford the luxury of a private room every night, why would you bother with a budget guide? I advise all budget travelers to opt for one of the Lonely Planet or Rough Guides."
2,Another Sony Repetitive Hit Collection on Johnny Mathis,"This is only a 10-track CD and there are no bonus tracks as the list above suggests. Four tracks come from CD ""Johnny's Greatest Hits"". Another one comes from CD ""Heavenly"". The five additional tracks were picked from 3 different albums not available in CD. This is not a smart and necessary hit collection because it does not serve longtime fans neither new entrants to Mathis art. Browse back and buy the splendid Greatest Hits and Heavenly albums."
